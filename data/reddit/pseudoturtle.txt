Coinbase seems to enjoy closing accounts for reasons unknown. When asked, they'll give you a great non-answer as to why it happened. Were you at least able to withdraw your funds?

.01 x 50,000 = $500, i.e. more than $50

Isn't anyone worried about a chargeback? This is a serious chance for arbitrage, so I feel like there must be some sort of catch. I'm pretty sure you can dispute a transaction up to 90 days after it has been made... so how long have these guys been in business for...?
I mean, I would really like to believe that they are a company for the good of bitcoin, but it just seems so ridiculous that they can't just buy the bitcoins from stamp and save 4%
Loving their completely unnecessary use of the Chicago skyline too lol.

I was worried about a chargeback as well, but the paypal was from VirWox, and it wasn't btcpromo that actually sent the paypal money.
My theory: they used the btc to fund virwox, traded it for higher and then told virwox to send the money to my paypal account... at first. Then, they said screw this guy and took my btc.
However, this is a good message for new sellers considering paypal for p2p btc trades- don't use it! Localbitcoins is notorious for having buyers send you money for btc and charging back anywhere from 0-180 days (180 days!)

They are a scam!

But of course! I know and even KNEW all of these things prior to this. It was an act of desperation and I let emotions get involved (duuuuuumb), simple as that. It was a good lesson to learn, and it only cost me 2 btc (!) to learn it.
........... still cheaper than a class at my university :)
Why the downvotes on your post?? This is good information!

Just trying to help out!

I actually just now was able to link it to coinbase (automatic process), I guess what I'm asking is how can I delete the primary number from my account without having to do the two-factor thing?
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:15:29
I just did in a comment above :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:50:23
I just read it was a ddos as well. Unfortunately, I still don't have my money. I will say this though: support has been in contact with me ever since (even if sporadically), and have promised my money within the week, so unless they mysteriously disappear within the week, I have no reason to doubt them 
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:43:14
But how do you actually make any money without the trading fees? IMO bitfinex's trading fee is more than reasonable, and I really don't mind paying it all that much.
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:49:57
I fucking hate paypal

I personally love Coinbase for its efficiency, but the sole problem I have is their stopping the instant buy feature (or changing it to $1000 a week, substantially less than before). I bought a good amount of coin at $630 only to find out that when they arrived in my wallet, they were valued at around $550 (it has, of course, since picked up, but the point remains).
They should have a feature to transfer funds from your bank account into the system and then purchase instantly from there. You may have to wait the 4 days, but you minimize the risk of market fluctuations without the pesky wire transfer fee or any of that other garbage other exchanges put you through. In fact, who can I talk to to make this a reality?
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:05:24
Yes, they are! I'm so glad somebody else has noticed. They SUCK
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:49:12
I see your point, I'd just rather receive an email or something like that... It's very annoying having BTC to sell, but no way to sell it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:17:06
And then David's little brother coming sometime in Chicago :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:54:32
Thanks for the responses, everyone! So, I think the consensus here is shady, but still pretty reliable. Well, I'm about to put some money into them, so if anything happens, I'll be sure to update. I guess I'll just stick with the number 1 rule: don't play with any more than you can afford to lose!
Fingers crossed that I don't get Gox'd
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:52:58
I might decide to post the screenshots later, but right now I'm sending out an email bomb to them. They might be able to ignore one email, but they can't ignore 1000 :D
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:45:55
I haven't tried authy support yet... and now I feel like an idiot. Yea the 2FA can really bite you in the ass on occasion, but I generally do like the added layer of security.
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:34:16
I'd actually really like to know the answer to this as well and would love it if they offered personal accounts.
Had to preemptively close an account at Wells after hearing that they were closing accounts associated with coinbase. I only have a couple of transactions with coinbase, but better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:31:31
I see what you did there. Very clever!
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:04:34
No, they never did. In fact, read this:

I was going to say it, but modus beat me to it! Offer any sort of discount even up to 2.5%- you're still saving money by not dealing with credit card fees even after the .5% bitstamp fee.
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:22:02
I already have, but a lot of articles etc. have turned up as mostly speculative. I suppose my question was mostly aimed at the criticism of his code, specifically the bashing of the use of PHP (and I'm not sure why this is a problem unless he lacked proper use of other security guidelines).
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:11:00
I'd be happy to. So, on the 11th of May, I decided to sell 1 btc to them, so I did. Then I decided that I could really use the money and sent another, before I even had the money in my account from the 1st one because I had to go into work (stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid).
They sent me an email telling me that the two transactions had been merged or something and that it read as 0/2 btc total. They then told me that I could either:
send 2 more btc and they would pay me for 4 btc or return the extra 2 btc or
wait a couple days to a week to have the developers "unmerge" them.
It has been 9 days now with very limited responses and no response whatsoever when I asked them (twice) to just cancel the whole thing and return my original 2 btc.
Here is where they keep the past/new victims' coins
Public service announcement to stay the hell away!
@_date: 2014-05-12 05:49:20
Have made a few small and successful sells to them and then ran into a small problem today. Sold one bitcoin, then another without receiving my money for the first. Apparently, this caused some sort of "problem" with their system and the payment will be delayed, maybe up to a week. They were very prompt with messages and whatnot, but I'm skeptical.
I definitely won't be using their service for quite a while after this, payment or no payment. Only time will tell...
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:40:28
Good call.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:39:30
It could, but I'm here until around June, so I just suspended the service on the phone
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:28:04
If a service like coinbase came out (easy, US accessible), but with btc-e fees, the customer could pay the retailer in bitcoin and the retailer could offer a discount and it would still be cheaper on both ends than paying with a credit card. With coinbase fees (1% for buyer, 1% for seller, and ~.5% difference between buy/sell price), the retailer would end up saving about .5%, which is not bad, but also not a significant amount, and offers no real incentive to have anybody pay in bitcoin, at the moment.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:09:52
No, I wouldn't. But using PHP for the trading engine doesn't strike me as a bad idea. As long as another, more modern / secure language was used for account security and personal information, I don't see it as a problem.
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:09:29
Well, their website is down now and I'm sure they've run off with all the money. Lost about $500 in btc :(
EDIT: it's back up now, but I have yet to receive payment for my btc. Will update as soon as it is received.
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:10:35
I will do that if they don't reply to my last one, which I gave them 24 hours to do. After that, the email/facebook/twitter bombs will come
