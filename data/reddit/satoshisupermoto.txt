This and much more, when Satoshi designed Bitcoin he had these Layers in mind. Once we get past LN, pretty much all alts will get destroyed, beginning with ETH.

Even if all alts were only paired to FIAT, alts would still follow the BTC trend. The same way DOWJONES drives stock-markets in foreign countries that have nothing to do with USA, and same way gold trends affect prices of other precious metals.
TLDR: risk appetite for a certain asset-class affect all assets in that class, even if those assets have different properties.

Not just steem, the entire list has no value at all, zero research, just random shill and fud. Its why from now on i'm going to label Weiss Ratings as "Ich Weiss Nicht" or IWN for short.

The latter is more likely.

"In SL people create their own characters, known as avatars, and live an alternative life, buying goods, real estate and living in a community of more than eight million people from across the world. They go about their lives, attending concerts and seminars, building businesses and socialising.
On the darker side, there are also weapons armouries in SL where people can get access to guns, including automatic weapons and AK47s. Searches of the SL website show there are three jihadi terrorists registered and two elite jihadist terrorist groups.
Once these groups take up residence in SL, it is easy to start spreading propaganda, recruiting and instructing like minds on how to start terrorist cells and carry out jihad."
That was written about Second Life 10 years ago when it reached some MSM attention. Today BTC is going MSM, so of course MSM needs to write the same story just replace SL with BTC and profit.
