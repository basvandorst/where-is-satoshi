@_date: 2015-03-11 11:04:00
hi there fella.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:52:53
you are not alone, satoshi as the creator of bitcoin is some kind of symbol for bitcoin and its anonymity, so we should all stop trying to break this anonymity.
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:33:20
1) install Electrum  
2) learn how to use Electrum, try testing it with small amount 0.0002 btc for example  
3) send all the coins from Multibit to Electrum or export the private keys of Multibit and **sweep** those keys in Electrum (do not import)
