Ah ah call whatever you want, but I don't see the point of asking for advice just for a laugh though. What would be the point in lying here. 
I am indeed richer than I have ever been thanks to Bitcoins, but buying 18 or something coins right now and waiting for it to go back to $1k and that's 18 grand. Worth thinking it through don't you think ?

Yeah, again, same thing here: I had my money stuck in withdrawal queue and asked to cancel it so I could buy Bitcoins.
Glad to know you're producing electricity for yourself thanks to Bitcoin, it's a great way to spend them !
I am genuinely sorry for those who have lost a fortune, sometimes all they had, too. In my case it's a small loss, won't even affect me anyway. It's more about the dirty feeling you get when you're being robbed...

I'm interested in money of course, but I'm in no rush.  
I did not express myself clearly in OP, I don't have $2k worth of coins on the site, I have $2k worth of fiat in another currency than US dollars.

Well, we have our answer today. I did end up buying the coins and, like you, I'll never see them.

Yes, I am aware of this option (thanks to [Reddit]( again), but if I was to buy some coins on MtGox I'd much rather keep them - at risk - than exchanging them for fraction of the value.

With Bitcoins, some morning you'd wake up to see that you had 1k when you went to bed that magically turned into 2k. Some other morning you wake up and see that you had 1k that magically turned into $0.00 - today this roller coaster made me throw up.

Yeah, great idea to have a sub here just about market experiences ! I think trust in such places is endangered by companies like Gox, yet it's an absolute necessity to have them for the sake of Bitcoin, in which people trust now.
