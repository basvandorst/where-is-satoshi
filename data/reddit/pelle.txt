We run a Bitcoin remittance search tool where we are trying to add as many Bitcoin exchanges as possible worldwide to help end users compare the full cost of using bitcoin with traditional methods.  
As an example see here how arbitrage between rates at different exchanges world wide can sometimes make people earn up to 20% when sending money.

Great article Michael

This is not the foundation page, it's the software project page. The bitcoin world is about removing gate keepers not adding them.

That is a good question. I'd talk to a lawyer specialized in the field for that. I wasn't able to get a straight answer.
My feeling is that you may be able to get away with just a federal MSB license as long as you only have a few customers in each state, but I really don't know.

I have no interest in helping them do anything. They and Moneygram have a history of screwing their customers over due to their near monopoly strangle hold.
Through lobbying they have been behind pushing for greater regulation to keep startups out.
They do not deserve the help of the community. If they want to go for this market, it is likely they are just learning about it so they can help lobby for more regulation.
Whatever they do in the US is not important for me. But they have sufficient power and money in developing countries to be able to persuade governments there to create Anti Bitcoin legislation.
I can't stress this enough. Don't help them out.

Feel free to ask any questions I'm the CTO and based in Nairobi.

Currently an independent company receives M-Pesa from the Kenyan customer and instantly delivers bitcoin back to them. We are working on streamlining this process even further and hope to partner with exchanges and mobile operators throughout the developing world.

There is some knowledge of it amongst more educated people. But ordinary people I explain it to instinctively understand the concept and benefits, without questioning the technical aspects too much.
But no doubt our primary job is one of education in the beginning.

Absolutely. Tanzania is on the way.
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:20:42
That is absolutely a use case we are working with. Our goal is to be able to make the whole flow cheaper than current solutions.

Hi I've been wanting to reach out to you. Look out for an email from me soon. We should have a coffee next week or this weekend if you're around.

You can send bitcoin to anyone with a mobile phone number world wide except the US.
To actually resend bitcoin they need a simple web browser. I have tested it on opera mini on various feature phones. Thankfully data is fairly cheap here.
We could implement a full sms based interface, but there are many obvious security issues surrounding it.
M-Pesa is implemented as SIM toolkit which is a small java program that runs on the SIM card itself. It communicates back and forth with the server using USSD.
Our USSD implementation is very similar to M-Pesa from a usability standpoint. The only main difference is that you need to remember a Short Code to access it. 
USSD is also complicated by the fact that you need your servers behind the wireless operators firewall for it to work. That problem we have solved through a partner in the telecom space.

It currently uses a combination of web and SMS. We are testing a USSD implementation which allows us to bring bitcoin to every single feature phone user in about 20 countries in Africa.

I don't have the exact figures, but there is a fairly large Kenyan diaspora abroad. Also important is that Kenya is very international. There are many Somali, Ethiopians, Ugandans and West African's here. I expect we will see a fair amount of flow both ways.

We are currently actively blocking both US IP addresses and Phone numbers from the wallet.
We may support US in the future but we don't want to risk our target audience by exposing ourselves to regulatory action by either the US or individual states.

While it is bad, it isn't quite that bad. I moderated the regulatory panel at Bitcoin 2013. The legal compliance estimate  for operating in all US states is around $1M.
The federal MSB registration is fairly straight forward and could probably done by yourself for free if you're on a budget. But that is just a tiny part of the regulatory compliance. You need to create a AML rulebook that can be shown on demand as well as keeping better records and reporting large and suspicious transactions.
The bond for each state does not have to be in cash. I forget the exact term, but there is an insurance like product that you buy similar to a bail bond company. The cost for this is minimal, but still a problem if you need it for all states. A company that does this was actually one of the exhibitors I believe at Bitcoin 2013.

In a country like Kenya it doesn't make sense to compete directly with M-Pesa on what it does best. There is nothing better anywhere in the world for person to person payments as long as you're within Kenya and on the Safaricom network.
Where we can make a difference in Kenya is with international and cross network transfers. We will support Airtel, Orange and Yu here in Kenya. Also you will be able to send funds to M-Pesa users in Tanzania from Kenya, which M-Pesa doesn't currently support.

Only if you actively block US customers. See:
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:43:41
We are actively investigating both these countries. We will likely partner with local companies there to solve the issues. 
In the mean time the wallet is already available in both countries just without a local exchange method.

Kipochi is available throughout Africa. The problem is exchanging. Please contact me pelle at kipochi and we'll see what we can do. I am working with people throughout the region to solve it.

Not yet, but that certainly fits into our simplified version bitcoin. We already support using phone numbers instead of addresses, millibits and we return shortened tx ids in our receipt sms's that resolve to the full transaction on the server.
I will write a post soon about how we're trying to make Bitcoin more compatible with humans and small devices.
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:58:02
We are just launching right now. I'm not sure if and when we will release any information on how many customers we have.
We are currently reaching out to the local community. We may use traditional advertising in the future as that is still quite effective here.
