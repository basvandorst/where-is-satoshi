This is why you never, ever leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. This exchange got hacked and had Bitcoin stolen from the hot wallet. The other Bitcoins were in cold storage so those are safe. Even though only 4,000 Bitcoin were stolen, they filed bankruptcy and marked everyone's accounts down to a fraction of their worth.
Never, ever, ever store your coins on an exchange.

Actually, it could. The courts just ordered Coinbase to share with the IRS anyone who has had more than $20k in transactions. SO the folks here saying a $20k transaction won't trigger a notice to the IRS are mistaken. This $20k includes transactions involving a buy, sell, deposit, withdrawal or transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:31:35
Yes. If you swap LTC for something else that is considered a sale. Even if you buy a cup of coffee with a crypto, that transaction is considered a sale. There is no way around this. If you have LTC today, and tomorrow you don't, then it's taxable.

BTH is Bitcoin Cash. Anyone that had Bitcoin on the day it forked got an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash.

I can't answer that as there is not a single investment in the entire world that I would just blindly hold. Just because Bitcoin made a lot of millionaires doesn't mean at this juncture we should be investing in something that we're just going to ignore.

Even bartering is taxable.

You'll never be wrong to take some profits off the table. You don't have to believe just one or the other articles. There are probably elements of truth to both....so take some $ off the table and hodl the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:50:28
Just throwing this out there.... $6.5k invested until you're 65 at 8% per year would be 165k. So whatever you do, look at it as if you have to make up that $165k with your Bitcoin earnings. The earnings in your roth will be tax free too.  So really you would need tonearm $231k in Bitcoin to break even after you pay taxes on the Bitcoin earnings.

It's these types of questions that keep me up at night. People borrowing from IRA's, mortgaging their homes, using credit cards etc to buy into cryptos. If you have to borrow $$$ to buy Bitcoin, you probably shouldn't be buying Bitcoin.

These poor people had the exact same mindset as you.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:49:53
The problem here is that you are trusting the word of the exchanges that they're really doing what they say they are. Since this isn't a highly regulated industry, you really have no proof that they coins are stored in cold storage. If you don't own your keys, you dont own the coin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:56:20
Oh, and this is probably the  riskiest investment you could possibly make. The fact that you said you want minimal risk means you should steer clear of cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:55:03
This is how we know Bitcoin is in a bubble. When greedy people want to "play" with their money and expect a 30% return in a month. Think about that for just a minute.....the average employee with a 401k would make 30% in about 5 years...and here is someone that wants to gamble that he'll make 5 years if average returns in a month. If this isn't "mania" i don't know what is. IMO, Bitcoin is *not* the investment for you.

Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for 
other property? 
A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency 
exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable 
gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less 
than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other 
Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, 
such as whether a loss is deductible.

I guess we can't blame you for trying lol

I think it's irresponsible to tell someone to forget an investment and come back in 5 years. Suggesting that someone should ignore any news (positive or negative) or developments and to not take action means you ought not to be invested in this space. This is a fast-moving industry and things could turn on a dime...and if you're just sticking your head in the sand and ignoring it, you shouldn't be investing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:58:56
Just about every coin they have on their website follows the exact same pattern....significant gains until 2020 then they fall. So I'm not really sure what to make of this site.

Andreas Antonopoulus (certainly not someone who doesn't understand the space)  uses this analogy all the time, and it's s valid analogy. The point is, being first to the party doesn't guarantee your dominance.

I'm not disagreeing that a long term perspective is good. What I take issue with is people saying to buy it and forget about it.

I think you've answered your own question. If you want to enter stop loss orders, then you need to store on the exchange. There's no other option. If you are asking which exchange is "safer", I'd have to go with Coinbase/GDAX. Like them or not, at least they have gained the attention of investors and recently received $100mm in private equity funding, which gives them a sense of legitimacy. They also have insurance against theft. So Coinbase is one of your safer options.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:46:08
Yep...any time is a good time to buy if you're holding. Oh...and get yourself a hardware wallet at some point. I have the Ledger Nano S...totally worth it. Good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:42:12
welcome to the club. Please set reasonable expectations. You're not going to see the same level of returns that we've seen in the past. That ship has sailed. True, $100 invested at the beginning would have made you a millionaire today. But that's because you could buy 100 Bitcoin for $1. But to experience those same returns means Bitcoin would have to be worth $54 million PER BITCOIN. My point here is not that BTC is not a good investment. It is. But temper your expectations.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:27:56
Both. if you work in the US or make money in the US, you owe the US taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:43:38
That's one of the easiest ways, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:19:48
One other thing...don't start "predicting" like you said. You mentioned you are predicting a large correction and will buy more then. Since you're predicting a large correction, why did you just buy? You should have waited.
Seeing your other comments, you intend to hold...good! That's the right answer. Don't start making predictions :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:41:21
Yes, this is indeed a risk. I would never buy from anyone other than the manufacturer.

Yeah, we didn't notice.

Bitcoin is not meant to be used for small purchases. It's going to take months since Segwit activation before Bitcoin fees will be small enough to handle micro transactions...and even then, we need lightening to make it more reasonable.

It most certainly is possible and the IRS has already been trying to do this.       
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:55:54
Sure can. In fact, the IRS has contracted with a company called Chainanalysis to help them identify address owners.

I find it interesting that you've been telling people to hold their coin, and "never sell all your coins", yet you did the exact opposite of what you're telling people to do. See, the problem here is that you tell people to do one thing, yet you do another. Which is exactly what amateurs do. It's really easy to give advice when you have no skin in the game.

Actually, it did. It could be argued that AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy  made the internet accessible to the masses and without them the internet would not exists as it does today. I remember having dozens of the AOL discs laying around...and truthfully, had it not been for AOL, I would have had no idea how to access the internet.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:42:22
Safe? Sorry, but an investment that drops 60% in a month can hardly be considered safe.
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:14:38
Why is everyone blaming August 1st? Why doesn't the fact that the price was up 2000% in a year have anything to do with it?
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:24:15
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:06:18
But it all boils down to the fact that the BTC network cannot handle the volume. Regardless of what is creating the volume, if BTC is going to be adopted as an everyday currency, there cannot be instances where it takes 8 hours, or longer, for a transaction to be confirmed. If BTC cannot handle current day volume without bogging down, then there's no hope that millions of people will use it. It suppose it depends on what your vision is for future state of BTC. The fact that the fees and transaction times are correcting themselves isn't relevant IMHO. The reality is that Visa can handle peak 40k transactions per second. Bitcoin - 7. How can BTC become a world currency processing 7 transactions per second?
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:19:14
While it's true there is much to learn about inflation/deflation/supply and demand, your basic premise is correct....sort of. If inflation is 4%, then yes, you need to make 4%, after expenses, just to break even. This is why putting money in a savings account or a CD is not going to keep you ahead of inflation as your buying power decreases over time. But your comparison of 2% expense ratio in mutual funds vs. 4% Bitcoin doesn't make sense for 2 reasons: 1).Bitcoin doesn't charge annual expenses  2) inflation impacts both investments equally - it doesn't matter if you have $100 in Bitcoin or $100 in a mutual fund....they both have the same purchasing power.
I'm not quite following why you feel stock splits matter here. Market cap is market cap, regardless of the number of shares outstanding. It doesn't matter if you have 100 shares worth $50 each, or 200 shares worth $25 each. The value is still the same.
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:38:32
Maybe I misread this. But I'm referring to both Segwit and hard fork possibility. Point is, most are blaming volatility on these issues rather than the fact that cryptos are up thousands of percentage points.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:46:14
The issue is if Bitcoin doesn't scale, the chances of mass adoption as a currency are significantly impaired. The only use for Bitcoin will be to transfer larger amounts of value. A couple weeks ago I paid $6 to move $100 BTC and it took 8 hours....that's not scaling "fine" if you expect Bitcoin to be used as an everyday currency.
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:23:22
No, we absolutely do. Again, depends one what your expectation for BTC is. If it's to be a global currency, then we need scaling solutions. If your expectation is that BTC is used to transfer large sums of value, then BTC doesn't need a scaling solution.
And yes, global currencies have been around for thousands of years. But the truth is, major world currencies handle more than 7 transactions per second. Think about that for just a minute....if only 7 people in the world could exchange currency every second, we'd have a global financial collapse.

All these crazy "experts" now. And I hate click bait.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:13:19
Yes I saw that. But market cap is not the same thing as earnings. Two completely different stats. This cannot be called a P/E ratio, nor can it be compared to P/E ratio which is broadly used in the financial industry to determine how expensive a stock is. This is not the same thing. I appreciate you taking the time to put this together and thank you for trying to provide us a tool that could help us make better decisions...but the terminology isn't working for me.

@_date: 2017-06-27 19:19:28
Also, what you're trying to do more closely approximates the price-to-book value (P/BV ratio) rather than a P/E ratio.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:34:26
Wow. Is this a serious question? Because this is just about the dumbest thing to do. Not a good idea. Ever. Do not borrow money to buy a highly volatile asset unless you are highly experienced, which sounds like you're not.

When ethereum split last year, Coinbase allowed users to withdraw the newly formed ETC for a very limited time. I owned Ethereum at the time, and when it split, I had Ethereum on both chains. I did not take advantage of withdrawing my ETC at the time because I didn't understand how it worked and thought the ETC was pretty much dead. Wish I had done it then because I can no longer access them.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:13:30
And now, my friend, you are seeing the perils of Bitcoin and what everyone has been preaching for years. The block chain has the inability to scale hence transaction times and fees are increasing.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:34:24
How is this a price to earnings ratio? What earnings are you using to create this P/E ratio?
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:28:00
You're correct. Bitcoin is not a "company" therefore there is no one to pay for such ads. Where would the money come from? Who would the ad agency/Google send a bill to? There is no one to send a bill to because it's not a company.
