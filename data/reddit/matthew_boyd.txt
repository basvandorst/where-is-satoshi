A little bit of inflation is good within an economy. It makes sure that prices are increasing, and so consumers know this, and therefore will spend. As long as things such as interest rates are low, so that more people can borrow money with little repercussions. The UK has a margin of 1% inflation over and under the target. This is because if there was a lot of inflation, prices would increase a lot, and usually people's wages won't be in-line with inflation, and so they will have less spending power within the economy. But if there was deflation, then there could be a situation like in Japan whereby the consumers feel as if prices will continually go down, and therefore they won't want to spend money, instead they will want to save it until the prices go to their rock bottom. Due to not knowing when that is, no one spends in the economy, therefore there is no consumer confidence. Lowering the GDP of the country. Not sure if that totally answers your question, but that's where my knowledge of economics ends in terms of macroeconomics.

Haha, Gamemaker, I remember having to use that for I.C.T in school, that was painful, I must admit. For your efforts, have my upvote!

You could also post to :)
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:26:17
It depends really. Which is more profitable when you take into consideration the cost of your time, and the cost of electricity. If the cost of electricity is higher than the payment from mining, then that is not profitable, and perhaps collecting a few extra satoshis from the faucet would be more resourceful! On the other hand, if you have any skills or qualities, and you would like to earn bitcoins for them, you could always visit to do so! ;-)

Haha, not a problem, best of luck!

If you want to learn really important things, just google bitcoin, and see the news tab. If it is something big, it will be there. Otherwise, if you want technical, just day to day queries, this sub-reddit is perfect for you. :)

Here is basically the summary of what I have seen: 
* There is a reporter named Leah who has been hunting for a lead on Satoshi for 2 months.
* She found someone with the name Satoshi Nakamoto and so tracked him down to a person in California. 
* She went to his house, interviewed him and manipulated what he said. 
* Due to the manipulation, he has been harassed by many reporters, and due to being an elderly man, it has upset him and his family alot. 
* Currently, the evidence is mounting that he is not Satoshi, and rather a peaceful man that just wants to live his life. 
* Unfortunately, the reporter refuses to apologies for the inconvenience that she has caused. 
Hope that is a little clearer for you. 
Also, Satoshi himself came back and said on a messaging board that he was not Dorian, the suspected Satoshi.

That keyring is actually the very first thing I purchased in Bitcoin. It was such an awesome feeling to have that bad boy delivered to your door, knowing that you paid for it with a virtual currency.

Yes, the hyperinflation in Germany in 1923 was crazy! It got so bad that workers had to bring a wheelbarrow to work to collect their money, and the wheelbarrow was worth more than the money itself. Also, they had to get paid twice a day to keep up with the rate at which money was losing value, which is extremely absurd.

You deserve all the publicity man! You're an asset to our community! It's just unfortunate that it was dug up a year later, but still shows that you have been able to affect someone so much that they had to put "pen to paper" so to speak and make their thoughts heard!

There is a small piece of paper in a town close to me, that is near a bank and it says this quote. Thought it was pretty good when I saw it! 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:48:21
Yes, let's hope for your sake. It would also be an extremely disrespectful move if they used the name of charity to promote a scam. I will give them the benefit of the doubt, even though the evidence is mounting, until proven otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:58:56
Looks like an awesome concept, but I would prefer not to link it with my Facebook. Perhaps you should reconsider this, although it is a great marketing technique, it is not the best one for the Bitcoin community, as most of them want to stay anonymous.

Hey! I haven't done my UCAS form yet, but I would also like to mention them, as they have been a big part of my life / I have had a good bit of experience derived from them. I presume you would literally say they are an uprising digital currency. What you have done with them, and your general experiences e.g. projects you have worked, but don't give too much of your own opinion on them. Not sure if that helps at all, but hey, was worth a try!

@_date: 2014-03-08 23:16:32
I've been a little bit out of this story, unfortunately, but it feels as if the evidence is **pretty** conclusive that he is not Satoshi and for some reason this "Leah" will not apologies for her wrong-doings. That's pretty low that she has the balls to unset an old man's life and not have the decency to say one word... Sorry. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:22:59
Oh hey, I remember you gave like 0.01 bitcoins away, you're an awesome guy!

There's early bird at the moment, I think that's pretty good: 
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:37:31
I somewhat don't see this as a solid investment at all. You guys tell us that we are being cynical with our posts, but if you post under the alias, "bitcoins_suck" telling us to invest in dogecoins, I'm unsure what type of reception you are looking for. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:20:25
This guy. Nothing else is required. You hit the nail EXACTLY on the head.

I try to teach as many people about Bitcoins in my school. I say teach, it's more inform and they can make their own decision on how they feel about them. Some, of course, have said that it's just a ponzi, whereas others have embraced it, and have bitcoins as well as dogecoins and regularly exchange them. They also keep me updated on the price, something which I had got away from. That can be both a very good thing, and very bad! 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:10:58
This is pretty interesting. I actually once wrote a prospectus like document for Danny, as he messaged me on Jobs4Bitcoins. He never included it, however. I've always wanted to know what he did with it. Looks awesome though, I love the work of NeoBee's and wish them the best for the future! 
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:51:40
Couldn't agree more. Once the media get a sniff of a story, they jump on it like it's world war three. It would be better if they looked slightly more into it, and gained more facts and figures instead of interrupting an innocent man's privacy.

It's true. If I wasn't so busy with school work, I would totally take this up. There are limited places to get a hold of Bitcoins locally where I am from, and so the demand would be filled. Heck, you could even charge quite a premium purely because there is so little supply.

Perhaps I got the wrong end of the stick here, could someone clear up my misconception: From what I read, they are accepting it on their website, and locally in Glasgow, does that mean that if I walk into my local branch in Northern Ireland that they will know, and let me pay for my items in bitcoins?

Wow, it's usually both Northern Ireland and Ireland being pretty far behind when it comes to adapting new technologies, perhaps the North more so, but it seems like Dublin is really forcing it of late. There has been a lot of news coming from there about Bitcoin.

Hey Andreas, so Bitcoin is obviously tapping into a lot of sectors, Jobs, Shopping, Housing, Ostentatious items. What do you feel would be the sector / niche that would make Bitcoin rise considerably in value, and what would be a sector that if we continue to stay in may bring us down to $0, if there is one. 
Thanks and carry on the good work sir!

Wow man! Just wow! Even though I would find that hard to relate to, but not impossible, that's seems scarily accurate. Even though I don't know the feeling of being an entrepreneur, or setting up my own business, I feel as if you summed that up perfectly! It wasn't bias towards preventing people from starting up their own business, but it does bring them back to reality at the end of the day! Also, even though we haven't spoke in a while, feel free to message me, I'm always up for talking through others problems and will try and assist to the best of my ability :) Much love Jason!

I remember a thread similar to this, however, it is was more about one of the father's son wanted Bitcoins bought for him, or wanted his allowance in Bitcoin. So his Father offered to give him say $5 a week, and pinned it to bitcoin prices, and when his son wanted to cash in his money, he would get his $5 fiat converted through the value of bitcoin. So his allowance may rise, or fall. I feel as if this is a good interactive game you could play to teach your son about the value of bitcoin. In terms of the advantages, use as little words as possible, and say something a long the lines of:
* "If I send money through the bank, it will cost me a lot of money, whereas if I send money through Bitcoins, it doesn't cost me as much" 
* "With banks, I have to enter my details such as my first name, and surname, whereas with bitcoins, I send my money to a random person over the internet(perhaps that is a little iffy in terms of an explanation for anonymity, I am trying to dilute the explanations as possible, but still convey the message.)"
In terms of how the network works:
* Bitcoiners have to solve maths problems with their computers by software which is readily available to download. They need computers with a lot of power, and so they team up in pools. When a person makes a transaction, there is a transaction fee attached to this, and this goes into a big list, and to anyone that solves the list, there is a monetary reward of bitcoins. The bitcoins earned are then shared between each of the people in the pool. 
I really don't think there is much more detail you can go into. It's super awesome that he is intrigued and you are willing to help him out, I'm sure he'll appreciate that in the future, for sure!

If you would like to get some good publicity, may I suggest that you have something in associations with SeansOutpost, seeing that Sean, the person that Jason(owner of the outpost) collects for, was heavily involved in Magic the Gathering.

Okay, seeing that I am from the UK, I googled what 9th grade was, and it says that is around 14 and 15 year olds. So who I would target this at would be the computer scientist type people, but in a friendly way, as to not exclude those who are not wishing to carry on computer science. So what I would make sure to say would be: 
* Bitcoins aren't owned by anyone, no banks.
* The price is determined by the supply and demand. 
* Due to there being no companies that have a central say over Bitcoin, they can't enforce transaction payments, per say, so you can send many millions of dollars for pennies, whereas if you were to send that through something like PayPal, that would be extremely expensive, in comparison. 
* You can make money from nothing, literally. Mining is a way to obtain bitcoins by using just your computer! (That's something that attracts everyone, and then they stay to get more informed on how to make greater sums of bitcoins.)
* It's a great way for people your age to earn some decent money. If you work for bitcoins, say on (self-plug, no shame!) and the price of bitcoin increases, then you may see your pay double, or maybe even triple, or more! 
Hope that helps a little. That's the way I would explain it to my class, and I am 16, so I think the wording is appropriate enough. If you need any more help, don't hesitate to ask me!

If they are a small business, why don't you try and go in and talk to them a little bit about Bitcoins, and see if they are interested in it at first( *Sometimes* a small tip can get their appetites whet ). If not, make sure not to try and force it down their throats, that's the worst possibly thing, as they will dismiss you straight away. Take it back a little bit, and see if your wife is willing to perhaps compromise on the ring. I know that's an extremely hard thing to do, seeing that it has so much sentimental value. I will sign the petition regardless to help you out a bit. I hope it works out well for you man, and if so, I wish you the best for you proposing! ;-)

I totally respect that. I have seen some post on there that have been manual labour. I don't think that they got anyone to do it, but hey, Bitcoin is a new technology, and a lot of people use it for the anonymity, so I would respect that. I feel that as Bitcoin grows, so will the job market!

Perhaps you can find somewhere that sells coffee with bitcoins near you? I know there's a cafe near me, and it's the only one in the country that accepts bitcoins, so I must get down and order something with some loose change! Personally, I use bitcoins, but not entirely sure!

I feel this is probably a good thing. It's like School, if you like a subject, for example, computing, but then are forced to do it on a daily basis, with things you don't like within computing, you start to dislike it.

@_date: 2017-05-12 23:52:41


Yeah absolutely, at the time it definitely was the right thing to do! 


I feel that this is a massive key point! I've recently done this, and it's great, all you have in unrealised profit, but no losses to consider. I did it the same way you explained taking some out as I go to make sure that I've got **something** out of bitcoin if the market was to flop tomorrow. 


Can totally relate to this! As a student, loans are probably one of our only worries, and to have that burden uplifted is worth far more than the cash value behind it, and seeing the relief first hand from what's essentially a gift must be rewarding in itself! 
I genuinely do really value your insight, you come across as very knowledgeable and always have done, even in the early days of bitcoin on Reddit! I love reading your posts about Tesla's stocks! As someone who's only been in Bitcoin because it was the easiest thing to shares for me at such a young age, I've never had the opportunity to get a broker and invest in stocks and shares themselves (apart from ASICMiner's shares) so I'm really keen to learn more! 
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:40:25
I appreciate that a lot man! Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:11:23
I've known you for a good while now, and have also followed your Reddit because I think you've a great mind for investments! I have one question which I feel I already have the answer to, do you regret the volume that you sold? 
From your post, you seem very pleased with your actions, and I guess as with everything, hindsight is a god-sent! 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:36:48
A little late to this thread, but Bitcoin's definitely taught me a lot of life lessons! 
Being young, and naive, I found Bitcoin through a friend. Now at the time, he kind of brushed it off, as if it was a technical thing, and I wasn't very technically minded at this point. So I gave it little thought. A few months later, he was toying around with the protocol itself for development, so I decided why not take an interest in it, and see why he was so infatuated with it. So I started to read up about it, but again I give it little thought, until I started to really enjoy computing (programming, gaming, etc.). I've always watched documentaries on entrepreneurs and find it so interesting as to how people can think of such small but in-genius ideas, and this was around the time that I had a real craving to get into the work place. I always felt like the things I was learning in school were no use to me - the stereotypical view of a teenagers, but I felt really strongly about this, and wanted to put real life skills into practice. So I thought why not accompany my want of a job with my entrepreneurial spirit, and so I thought why not create a job board, so I could get jobs, but not only that, other people my age who had similar feelings to my own would be able to get paid for small jobs. Paypal didn't allow you to have an account under 18, but why? That just leaves it mere impossible for children to do jobs and get paid for them - some being more productive than adults in their jobs for many years, there was no reason to deny them what's rightfully theirs, and so bitcoin formed a great medium for this. The anonymity of the payment meant that you didn't have to reveal your age, and potentially be discriminated against because of it! 
In this aspect, it taught me that small things can lead to HUGE opportunities, and that you should always pursue an idea, no matter how small it is. 
Through the bitcoins that I earned on the job board, I was able to then do what I wanted with them - albeit, they weren't near the price they are today, so around &lt; $100, so like all curious teenagers, I took a look into the gambling aspect, and don't get me wrong, it was fun at the time, and I wasn't stupid enough to regret any of the decisions I made, but I was able to learn for myself that the house always won, and didn't have to take someone else's word for it. 
As well as this, I learned the stock market a little too. When ASIC miner shares were a big deal, I was able to invest in them, just because I really didn't understand how stocks worked, and I thought jumping in at the deep end was the best way of doing it. Luckily it was, and I managed to ride the wave successfully, mostly down to luck, but I then evaluated it later, and seen how the news and push backs were altering the price of the stock, and how dividends worked. So all in all, that taught me the basics of stocks, as well as the key saying of "Don't invest more than you're willing to lose". 
Lastly, and it's a more peculiar one. Bitcoin's definitely taught me some patience, I've always been a quick fire guy, but Bitcoin's changed my mindset, and helped pace me as a person. Things don't just happen over night, they rarely will, but if you're patient, good things will happen!

Yes, for sure, I used to be a big reader on Reddit, ever so often I post post a link here and there, however, now I post all over and It gets to the point that I feel that I have a minor addiction to the whole things, which I suppose isn't the best thing, but it has definitely taught me a lot about economics etc. 
Welcome to the Bitcoin community by the way!

You contacted a mod?
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:26:14
First off, it was not as if it was manual, everything was automated, so it wasn't a spelling error or anything like that. It was a glitch in the system. I am all for teaching people lesson, this is what I am trying to do with you, to be more respectful of other people's opinions, however that is not the point. They had all ready been "taught a lesson" of a rather large amount by a whale on the website, like I said in my first comment. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:20:29

@_date: 2013-03-25 00:07:42
I believe that is a given. It is all down to luck whether or not you can predict what is going to happen. There could be an unfortunate turn of evens and Bitcoins could plummet, or they could go sky high, who knows, no one.

[GUIMINER]( Would be the client you would use to mine.
Then you pick a pool, for this example I'll use [Slush's Pool]( Just remember your mining details are your "workers details." So they are the username and passwords that you put into GUIMINER. Hope that helps, thanks Matt.

To expand on digital's point, you could always sell it now on Ebay and buy Bitcoins with it and then wait until the price goes up and then you have made a profit onto of a profit?

I believe the transaction fee on MTGox is around ¥14,000. Just bear that in mind before you make any haste decisions, therefore transferring small amounts of money would be worthless.

I can totally see where you are coming from. I respect that you are generous enough to give away the bitcoin, however you have to take into account that most people in Bitcoins have been scammed once or twice and would prefer to keep that tally low. Thus they take due diligence when trying these types of things. 
Hope that clears some things up.

I don't understand what you mean by "laundering them" however, if Bitcoins stay as Bitcoins, they are tax-free, however once they are changed back into USD or GBP or alternatives, they become taxable, as to ways around, pass.
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:57:55
Very very nice website, however, seeing that it is Bitcoin, and it is online, it has to be provably fair. So make that a priority.

Thank you! :) 
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:16:48
I feel that it is extremely easy. I use MTGox, it takes a while to verify your card, however after that it is okay. It starts to get a problem after 100BTC I believe, then you have to send identification. (I'll check that now.)
Hope that helps, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:18:35
Half a million dollars, that's pretty impressive, and for the car, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. :) 
AS for the debit card, I would be 100% sure about that, I know that you can withdraw to a debit card as long as you have an IBAN number, then you can, so if it does, I guess you can. 
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:48:06

That would be awesome, although could you make them cheaper than they are worth etc? That's where the competition is...
@_date: 2013-07-17 11:13:25
If you would like, I would do the escrow, however, you would have to make sure that you have the amount of coins in your possession. Then once you have the order made and a signed message from Mike, then I could release the coins to you. Otherwise, if you don't have the coins to begin with, and these are purely to get them, then you would give me the address, I would check it with mike and send them myself to him. 
Let me know if you are interested. 
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 21:56:28

At the moment, I believe it is free, however I think a 2% fee would be reasonable enough, hope this helps, let me get the creator in here to help you out a bit!

Why thank you! I am not biased to anything in Bitcoin, so that helps. :)

Yea, likewise, have a good one! :)

No problem, glad to help you, hope all goes well!

Okay, shall post it now, one second, it'll be in the description. 
By the way, this is my first proper project with Python, bare that in mind. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 14:36:39
That's fine, I'll try and keep looking, I see that your peek was january 2013 according to Google trends which would narrow it down a bit:)
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:03:47
Sure, erm, do you mind that it's hosted on my website? Or can we get a work around?

Yes, this exists, if I am correct, you are talking about this; [Link]( It generates an address that the money is sent to and will end up in a defined wallet.
EDIT: However, if you would like to create something else, you should visit and see if anyone over there would like to help you with your project. Thanks, Matt.

@_date: 2013-04-13 23:31:04
Yes, I just included it, you don't have to use it, the way the program works is that it takes your input and gives you out multiple hash results like the ones mentioned above, from there it is personal preference into which one you want to use. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:35:25

Hmm.. the last time I checked it was at least 90x, perhaps I am wrong.

Thanks, I am really really tempted...
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:28:12
I believe you will pay and they will go to a temporary account then you can transfer them, or if you use a service that lets you use your original wallet, then you'll be fine.

"Hey Bitcoin, our much superior leader."
"Oh guys, you don't have to be that generous! Although, you are right, I am the one that has made the most progress at a steady rate over the years, plus I am a decentralized currency and so the bank can't intervene with my affairs. "
" That's a great plus of yours Bitcoin, I wish those stupid people would stop interfering with us, and just let the general public determine my value."
"Haha, that day may come young grasshopper, but for now, it shall only be a distant dream. Whereas I am free, free at last. "
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:39:57
It will take a while if it is free bitcoin websites, as they process all transactions in bulk so that they save on the transaction cost. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 18:54:09
Ah, I see, thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:53:06
I second this, you are a wonderful man. &lt;3
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:43:13
Thanks, I have really only started this project and am about 3 hours into the development. 
1. I am going to chance that soon, just getting a prototype out.
2. Yes, I am trying to work on that right now actually, so I store the random in a variable, let's say $result, post that to a database and hash it, then if the player clicks something it will grab the hash from the database, decrypt it and it will show the number?
3. I think I'll do that on the a different page.
4. I was thinking having the dice, which is 1/6 and then developing a coin which is 50% chance success rate and building up to a few mini games? + I was thinking of adding an odd / even and a first or second half on the dice to make it 50% odds?
5. I was thinking around 3x as some people could guess it right many times in a row and well, that would be my Bitcoin career over...
Thanks for the feedback, once again,
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:34:06
I think it would be awesome to have this on the sidebar.

One thing that I have found is that there isn't enough options on how you bought the bitcoins e.g. poker, for instance, another category could be working. I really like the privacy thing +1 for that. Waiting for my confirmation email, thanks - Matt.

@_date: 2013-10-15 17:08:16
Sean is actually the person who the charity is for, that's Jason who owns it. Sean was murdered over Magic The Gathering trading cards. :/
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:29:41
If you have enough Bitcoins, you could possibly do like a giveaway and give someone the bitcoins through your phone using the blockchain application. That would be pretty interesting, and make sure to give it to someone who was listening, so ask a question. As for the advantages:
* Somewhat anonymous
* Cheaper transaction fees
* Easy to change currencies
* Can make for free
* It isn't owned by the bank
* Its main source of popularity is off of Silk road
* It is highly unstable
* It once dipped to before $1
Hope that helps, Matt!
EDIT: Formatting.

@_date: 2013-11-01 16:19:59
I'm guessing this could come in handy: 
In terms on what topics to cover: 
How it is decentralized, the miners do the work of the bank. It is secured by SHA256 encryption. It is used all over the work as a single currency. Has mechanisms in place to prevent fraudsters(double spending) etc, etc. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 12:00:21
Ah, thanks, haha. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 03:56:42
Because I'm really hungry, raw. Go hard or go home.
@_date: 2013-01-27 00:42:00
Yes, that would also be something that I shall look into! 
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:04:26
You sir, have awful formatting. Additionally, thanks for being the bigger man and saying this on your real account that has a lot of reputation. :)
@_date: 2013-07-15 22:42:39
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:05:45
It all depends on the way the market goes. Some people who already own Bitcoins could be like; "Oh my the price has risen since yesterday, the bubble is bound to burst soon, SELL SELL SELL." These types of actions will decrease the price. However newcomers to the world of Bitcoins who are like; "Hmm... this could be an awesome investment, BUY BUY BUY" These action will increase the value of the Bitcoin. 
Hope that helps a little bit. 
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 08:56:41
Ah, Jonwaller, you are someone that has been active on there, and so I thank you, as it is people like you that really helped the sub-reddit out! Glad you had a good experience! :)

Yea, for sure! Just head over to and look into the sidebar, it should say something like "documentation" and that should be you!
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:23:08
Sent you an email, thanks Matt.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:41:55
No, I would strongly suggest not to sell, infact I feel that they could again skyrocket far further than the price which they are currently at. Of course you will see the initial drop-off of panic sellers, however it will grow stronger from that. 
So in summary; HOLD!
Thanks, Matt.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:56:23
Looks down from my end.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:30:16
Looks up for me. You should get confirmation of a win or a lose. If you win, you will get the multiplier of your bet, and if you lose, you get something low, close to a satoshi. Hope that helps, and I wish you luck! 
@_date: 2013-02-13 21:13:01
As I say, I am telling you this from my observations. To be honest, I would love to say that the ASIC machine was real, that would be awesome and would show how much technology has the power to advance in such a short period of time, however seeing that there isn't the most substantial amount of evidence, I myself have still got some doubt about them.
@_date: 2013-05-26 17:30:13
Well, I was not expecting that, thank you so much! :)

Why would they though, I could say that the dollar is useless, whoever wants to get rid of all their live savings, please give them to me, I don't see how anyone would want to do that and how it isn't begging. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 20:18:32
likewise, being a teen I would be so sure, the way in which bitcoins are developing is truly phenomenal, like I seen them when they were $10 and that was maybe 2 months ago? At most, so if I was you, I think that even if they did go down, there will be a time that they will progress to this stage again, if not higher, although don't take my advice, was just stating my opinion, I'm sure some of the more mature Redditors will be able to tell you. Thanks Matt. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:02:33
Of course you could, that would be great! Bitcointip has been enabled since the first week! :-)

\o/ Well done sir!
@_date: 2013-08-14 15:22:14
Is it just me or does this annoy everyone? Everyone says about how Bitcoins are used for bad things, of course they are, as you, Erik stated, a car, a cellphone, anything can be used for bad things. A fork can be used in a bad way, why does everyone focus on this? It seems like just because it is something that is rather new and so they like to bring it down before they have ever give it a chance. 
Also, 


What is he talking about, everything is a tool to the right person, money is a tool, thus Bitcoins is a tool. A pen is a tool etc, gah! This is starting to get more and more frustrating, why don't they focus on such things as it is cheap to send money, it is quick to send money, it is anonymous (which can of course be both good and bad) It is decentralized(that is something that comes up a lot, but I feel that this term needs to be expanded more for the novice to let them know exactly what this means.)
But all in all, well done Erik for trying to explain it, you are doing a great job, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-02-17 14:57:05
I'd be done if you like, and if you are doing it today.

@_date: 2013-07-01 21:39:22
Can 100% agree with everything said here, it is perfect, some friends and I bought credits on CoinURL on a new litecoin website and watched the traffic in real time and it was crazy, we got something like 27,000 people and like 12,000 uniques which was impressive, so the power of CoinURL is most certainly there. In fact, we were so impressive that someone kindly donated some CoinURL codes to and we are seeing the users roll in and of course the subscribers who come with it! ;)

Hmm.. now you have caught me. I remember that night, slowly sweating it, hoping they would recover. If I am correct, it was due to an exchange getting hacked and there were a lot of panic sellers, and so everyone just sold and the price plummeted, hopefully someone will be able to shed more light on this story, as I never fully comprehended it either.

I love the way this project was developed, using Bitcoin designers from within Reddit to get the graphics down to perfection, and may I say, they really do look smooth, and so I wish you all the best with this project, it looks mighty fine!

I can confirm that we already have a lot of generosity in the Bitcoin community, it you have a look at some of the highest tips, they are thousands of dollars to random people.

Hey, CoinURL has no automation in terms of approving publisher websites, infact, I am the one who does it. I do "somewhat" remember what your website was like, if I see a lot of advertisements on there, I will usually decline it as then it becomes more about the money than it does about the content. Seeing that you have resubmitted your website, I will take another look at it and take a decision on it. 
Thanks, Matt.

@_date: 2013-04-02 16:09:19
Seconded. I thought this was about creating a currency that no one would have total control of, however this would make it so that there is more of a chance of Big players in the market buying large percentages of available Bitcoins, thus the total concept of Bitcoins is lost.

It really just depends on the hardware and the electricity. If you aren't paying for electricity **yourself**, somehow, you will profit off it. Ofcouse there is a chance, due to all the ASIC miners that the profit will be very small, however it will still be profit for a little while. If you want to find your hash rate, get something like [GUIMINER]( and then register for a mining pool etc [Slush's Pool]( and then register a worker and once you have the deals of the **worker** enter them into the GUIMINER credentials. 
Hope that helps, thanks Matt. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 20:52:28
Is it really worth investing in?

It's okay to put the link, if I had the Bitcoins, I would help you out because I want to see them increase. However, the setup you could use Bitpay and just a simple website made in HTML and CSS. If you want an arguement for selling with Bitcoins about the value of them, they have done something like 100% times'd their value in the last 2 months which is crazy, hope it works out. Thanks.

I personally think that this is great, but not so much necessary! I believe that if someone, at any age is interested in Bitcoins, they will be willing, themselves, to look into it. Also, from people that I have been talking to, the ages start at an astounding 12 years old and go upwards. So like I said, there are many people in the Bitcoin community who are young and so I don't see why these are 100% necessary :)

@_date: 2013-10-30 17:04:03
Bitcoins are solid right now in my opinion. Well, as solid as they can be. They have been this price, or fluctuated around this price for a little while now. 


Well, that is dependant on you, if you are willing to risk the amount you put in, then yes, I suppose. Always remember to only put as much in as you are willing to lose. That is the key to success in this "game". 


Of course it will, it's Bitcoin, is is uber volatile. I think there will be a correction when people realise what they have bought into, and then, perhaps someone who has a lot of bitcoins try and scare the new people by selling off all they own, dropping the price, and so other follow suit, therefore the price drops due to panic sellers, and the rich person buys up more cheap coins, so it will always go back up again. 


In economical terms, I think that there is a speculative demand for this product. China has been pushing the price of Bitcoins up for the entire month, making it reach all time highs, so there is that. Also, there is an inelastic supply of bitcoins, therefore there will be more demand than supply, and so the price will, inevitably increase. 
Longterm opinion, I feel that they will continue to rise, and become more popular with the media and mainstream investors. People will see more stories of younger, and younger people becoming millionaires, and so they will "jump on the bandwagon" to try and gain this utility. 
Just my $0.02. :)
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:35:40

@_date: 2013-03-24 20:37:21
The probability is determined by how easy it is to earn a bitcoin, if people are earning them too quickly, the difficulty will increase. So if any people get a BFL mining rig, then the difficulty will increase because, as you say they produce a lot of bitcoins in a very short space of time. As for if it is worth it; no one really knows yet. The difficulty could increase ten fold by then and it might not be worth it, the value of the bitcoin could go down, again making it worthless. However you could get it the other way aswell.

Of course, if you can deploy common sense, you will be grand, but there are always a select few that do not, thinking this is an invisible currency whereby nothing can go wrong, which is incorrect! Great to hear you haven't been scammed before! :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:00:01
Wait what?


How does this make sense?
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:09:06
How about you try out @_date: 2013-07-16 01:00:21
Thanks for the tip, It was this one, "Who else you would recommend for us to have an interview?"
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:47:43
You know I would argue with someone who had the name "BitBeggar" and his account was 14 days old, however I feel that it would be a waste of time and energy. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 19:24:53
HAHAAHA, no one click this, it is a phising site, thanks - Matt. 
Going to have to report this to save a lot of people the misery of stolen information. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 11:31:58
No, if you reply to a comment, it will tip the comment you are replying to. I received the tip, thanks, Matt!
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:28:29
It is very hard to work with 300 x 250 I believe it is, however, if you would like to make an attempt, by all means, be my guest!:)
@_date: 2013-02-16 22:53:35
 there is a quick start guide, Basically, you first make an account by the export account function. Then you are free to put Bitcoins into that account. From there you have the ability to tip people with commands. Hope that helps a bit, tell me if it doesn't and I will try and accommodate you better!
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:36:00
Yea, the guy is pretty opinionated, if you can get past that, it isn't the worst read...

I do that on a regular basis.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:46:49
This is perfect for what the community needs! More projects which are open-source so that we can spark more projects which draw more attention to the Bitcoin! It's great, well done! 
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:19:53
Never really got to speak to you guys, but I just want to say that you are doing a great job in letting smaller companies accept Bitcoins, and heck, even bigger companies seem to be jumping on the band wagon, and so for that, I thank you! 
Keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2013-07-19 19:25:00
Once again, I fall victim to the generosity of Mr. Hardleft! I really do thank you, so much so that I feel like I'm sounding ungrateful, but that is not my intentions, you sir are one of the greatest beings to have this fine earth! Thanks again! Matt :-)

How about we enable bitcointip bot on a pile of new sub-reddits that are popular. Then we get someone to put a post up, everyone on upvotes the comment and some people tip them, getting more people asking; "What is this?" and then we explain everything?
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:17:16
Yea, that's why I also posted it in however some people from Litecoin come here on occasions and vise versa, it doesn't mean you are stuck to one sub-reddit, haha.

Shame on you OP, Not giving Reddit any money with your adblock :/

Thanks - Matt.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:22:18
I see where you are coming from, however, he wouldn't have been able to pay for the coins otherwise. I suppose the reason he hired me was to show that it was trust-worthy. Sorry for any inconvenience, I could put trust in to deliver!

[This is all that I have to say.](
@_date: 2013-07-31 23:24:02
Glad you received the coins, looks like escrow and everything went well, enjoy the coins!
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:07:45
I believe that it will be litecoin, as they have gained the most popularity, and actually have been rising quite a bit lately, as you can see [here -  
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:26:00
Hey, also from Ireland, try localbitcoins, I always sell to them and they are reputable. :) 
@_date: 2013-02-17 00:01:53
From what I have picked up; they are encrypted keys, that's really all I know, if anyone else can shine some light on the situation, that would be awesome! :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:01:32
Oh, I feel that there would be someone with more of a specialised knowledge on where to incorporate the company, sorry about that. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:38:04
No problem, also, welcome to Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:03:00
Yes, that's definitely good news. I am glad to see that people, even new-comers, aren't as reliable on Mt. Gox for their price, and certainly don't use them to buy Bitcoins, for the most part. CoinBase and Bitstamp seem to be the two main branches, which is awesome, as they both have very good support, however, I can see a large load mounting on both of them, one for UK and one for US, and a similar situation happening, whereby they become over-encumbered by the large load.
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:00:51
Wow, you just have to make sure that these things aren't fake.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:05:43

Would it be possible to have a go on this server, message me if possible? Thanks - Matt, looks awesome. 
@_date: 2013-01-30 17:50:56
You could always exchange your bitcoins into paypal vouchers and pay for Reddit gold that way, by the way, the site to do that from the top of my head would be [BitInstant]( Thanks - Matt.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:00:50
Yes, something like that, I already have that. I explain it better over here I feel; 
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:22:38
Sure will, thanks for that.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:02:14

Haha, thanks, it's a great language to try and learn for sure, it's extremely flexible! 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:58:33


Well, if it is just the website, host it wherever you feel comfortable with, and is reputable -- in essence, it doesn't matter.. 


Not at all, this has nothing to do with anything.


Keep it on your own machine and make them payout into that, or make it so that it goes into blockchain so that you can hold the credentials on your home machine (identifier and password and secuity phrase) so that your mind is at ease. (Also make back ups of that.)


Kind of unsure as to what you mean by this, if you can explain, I will try my best to answer your question .
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:55:55
You say that you are going to do work for Bitcoins and you are going to ask your clients, why not try keep it on the backburner and see if anyone is willing to let you take a job, could earn you a coffee or two for the road! :) 
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:36:30
Here is a little article that I made a couple of weeks ago, however I feel that it will fit you perfectly. [ARTICLE]( Second question, it depends on the price of electricity compared to the amount you make / your hashrate. Third question you can invest what you like and see what happens :) 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:29:56
Well, then email them. Make sure that your voice is heard. You have nothing to lose from diving further into this, so why not? I wish you the best of luck!  
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:25:15
Well, that's the risk of gambling, you win some you lose some. You have to be prepared to invest that amount that you are willing to lose. That is key. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:55:16
Is there anyway that you can prove that he has the rest of the money and that this isn't a huge scam?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:38:35
It will fall to 1000 ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:06:38

@_date: 2013-07-02 15:17:44
Erm, sure, he doesn't seem to be on his computer that much, however I can ask him to contact you, pm me your details on BitcoinTalk and I will get him to reply back asap!
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:11:02
Yes, that's awesome, every new addition adds potential for a customer of yours to get interest in Bitcoins and could invest, therefore improving the Bitcoin economy. As for your retouch work, have you ever considered posting on over there you may be able to get a job! 
Thanks, Matt.

Seeing that _RME_ isn't here at the moment, I shall TRY and clear things up from what he has told me about this project. 
Question | Answer
:-- | :--
Do you calculate it yourself or pull from the blockchain API? | I am almost sure that he pulls it from the API from what he was telling me (correct me if I am wrong RME!)
He has some other sites which currently have slipped me, but I am sure he can link you to them! 
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:20:32

@_date: 2013-08-15 15:20:01
Thanks for the message bitcrunch, if you could keep me updated via PM and here, much appreciated, Matt!
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:48:54
I was tempted to put that in, however I have never actually done it myself and wasn't 100% about it. I shall add it now.
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:32:16
Why can't I be a time-traveller? :(
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:21:32
Yea man! I guess something is far better than nothing. I still really don't like the guy and never will. He is quite simply a scammer and a general asshole. I'd say the refund is to try and restore his trust, but in reality, we all know that he did this for his own personal gain. I also really hope that those who take legal action against him can take him for everything he has. At least you were the bigger person and were pretty cool about it, I wouldn't have, he doesn't deserve it. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:59:20
Thank you, shall add that now!:)
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:06:01
Define "High-end". There are many factors that could make it profitable and many factors that could make it worthless. Right now if you had a good mining rig that pulled a couple of gigahashes, yes you would definitely profit, however if you are only in megahashs, I would say that you would profit seeing that the mining difficulty rose yesterday...
Hope that helps, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:15:12
Yes, I don't see why he didn't just leave the post as it was...
Thanks for that, Matt. ;)

 Tell me what you think of that. I just quick created it, it has audio however I can't seem to record that at the moment. Thanks - Matt. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:17:13
Haha, that's awesome that you are giving people this opportunity, afterwards, when the competition is over would you be able to show me how you would do it so that I could potentially compete is some of the later competitions?
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:05:20
Yes, I am going to look into improving that by using salted hashs or maybe two factor authentication of some sort, would that be better?
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:25:57
Well, it is a currency which isn't touched by the banks, it is fully peer to peer, meaning that it could fluxuate really rapidly really quickly, for instance, you probably saw last night that it went from 49 - 33 I believe which is pretty ridicules, however it is now pretty steady at 43ish, hope that helps, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 12:38:54
That's so unbelievable fake.

No problem. ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:28:27
This question gets asked A LOT, and the true answer is, no one knows when is a good time to invest in anything, you just have to take that leap of faith. As for the amount you would invest, what I would suggest, and so would many others is only put as much in, as you are willing to lose. If you don't want to lose a lot of money, then don't put it in, simple. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:25:06
That's awesome, some of the things that I would have would be live Bitcoin charts such as [This]( and maybe after you can show how big the community is by showing the [blockchain]( transactions going through one by one. You could also show them the video on the small crash in 2011, that would be interesting, thanks - Matt. 
As for the payments - you could get them to generate a wallet on their phone and you scan the QR code to send the bitcoins, therefore you would show off another feature that Bitcoins utilize. Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 11:20:01
Thanks for the kind words! Be sure to check in every now and again! :-) 
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:53:37

Thanks, Matt! :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:27:53

Good guy RME, trust worthy guy, keeps to his word!
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:41:17
Sure, removing it now, it feels like I can't do anything right these days. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 18:21:10
It should be difficult. Basically, it is your GPU or CPU trying to crack a hash or a passcode type of a thing. So whilst you are mining you are trying to crack these hashes. The hashes are usually the transaction fee that you pay something around 0.0005, that is your reward. Another reason why you can't get a hold of them is that there isn't *that* many in circulation.
@_date: 2013-08-20 22:07:40

Great cause, love the man, and have heard roughly about this exciting new project, no details, however! Worthy charity, hope you all the best, and good on you Hardleft for doing this, you are, as I have said on many occasions, a gentleman, and a scholar. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:44:03
There is no such thing as paying too much to charity.

Thanks Jason! :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 17:56:56
This is super interesting and nice to see on here, thought that it would have been more, seeing that there is 1btc in it at the moment that was in the last month, however, I am sure there is a reason for that. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:56:44
I prefer to use blockchain at the moment, however it is really up to you! :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:12:49
Yea, totally! :) 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:38:40
Nope is the short answer. Not even 50Ghashes will cut it, and that's being honest. What you would need would be a serious investment, I'm talking a good few terrahashs and then you might make some bank. Seeing that your username is: "OneRichBastard" -- I'm sure you could dump a little bit into it. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:09:26
Well I suppose, from my point of view it would be that Bitcoins can be made for free, through such things as mining. I feel that through that it would show that it is a far superior currency, it has nothing to do with banks so they can't drag it's value down, that would be some reasons into why I think it is better to pay with Bitcoins, additionally, they are tax-free.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:48:48
Very awesome story that you have, and a lot of nice cars, and it is great to see that you are giving out bitcoins! Very noble!
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:07:24
Of course it is every skills, however some of the skills are harder to offer than others, I named the ones that are easy to offer such as virtual skills. Due to Bitcoins being an anonymous currency, not all people want skills such as decorating done for Bitcoins as that would involve people going into their house. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:31:52
Congrats, I think I have milked you of enough free money, I'll stand aside for others! 
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:58:06
Make sure to keep the prices in Dollars which are equivalent to BTC so that you aren't paying a ridiculous amount for at T-Shirt. Also, you have an error in your admin permission.
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:58:57
Of course someone is paying for it, however it isn't always you, that's the point that I was trying to make. For instance, in places where I live the landlords pay for the electricity, thus free electricity for the person that wants to mine. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:50:12
These are the companies that we want on board and that are going to show Bitcoin in a good light, well done namecheap, you are awesome! ;) 
Also, used them maybe three times and have had no problems,  I would purchase off of them any day.

@_date: 2013-08-15 10:11:14

To be fair, they both serve the same purpose, to a degree. What I am going to say, is get regex on those input boxes, all Bitcoin addresses start with a "1" so that should be looked for in the code.

As you probably know is meant to be making a new forum as he has a huge stash of bitcoins to pay for it: 7631.42948909 BTC. Unfortunately, he hasn't done anything with that, to date. I was going to make a forum type thing for Jobs4Bitcoins using the same software that BitcoinTalk use, SimpleMachines, but it is highly insecure and bots crawl all over it. I think it will be hard to fulfull all of the things listed in the OP but overtime, we will see a decrease in the number, as more and more not-so-serious people dwindle out of Bitcoin.

You for one obviously do not know who you are talking to, a bitcoin veteran who is not disillusion at all about the price of bitcoin, he is a realist that knows bitcoins are only the price they are currently worth, no more, no less. Secondly, of course he has more than 2 Bitcoins, he gave away that amount in one day and over his time, I would say he has give away more than 20-30 BTC, that's only in a year. So, I feel that you are in no right to comment on this. 
Also, why are you bringing age into this? At whatever age 180 dollars is a lot of money. I'm 16, does that mean that you can be disrespectful to me because of that?

No, there isn't really anything that is stopping you, other than a fee transaction fees. However you get some bad karma from the Bitcoin community as many people want others to keep their Bitcoins so that the value rises even higher,

Here's a rough run-down, basically leetcoins are coins that you use to trade with other gamers. So if you want a match, and believe you can win, you put up a leetcoin bounty, and play for the bounty. Then the winner takes the pot. I believe that's what it is, I think I heard it somewhere else, but don't quote me on that.

All right, here is a copy and paste from the developer of CoinUrl: 
1. There are 2 banners registered in system (728x90 and 468x60) with a click price 0.0001 BTC, 17+12 clicks were registered, 14 of them were rejected by antifraud and money were returned. Other clicks are registered as normal, if you have complaints -- please, send IPs to support and we will return money for ALL fraud clicks.
2. There was no geo or language targeting set, the price was the lowest in our system, so these banners were shown only for unpopular countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, India. Mover, they were shown only on low-quality sites, because high-quality sites set minimal click price to 0.3-0.4 mBTC so this advertiser could not be shown there.
We recommend for our advertiser to stop such campaign, set geo targeting correctly and set higher click price.
In case of any fraud activity we recommend to send messages to support. Our company always return money to advertisers.

That's a rather bold statement. It's such a volatile market, any news of something wrong, and we can drop hundreds in value in seconds. So I wouldn't say that that is a very good prediction. I would say that there will always be a demand as long as there isn't any chance of centralization, however, if there is, this whole project will be pointless. As long as there is demand, and a limited supply (21 million), the price will always meet new market equilibriums and so have to rise. :)
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:54:09


I don't think this would be the case, if you were to do it, you would have to put certain amounts in different exchanges such as: 
* MTGox
* Bitinstant
* CoinBase
* ETC
As most of them have either a waiting time for verification etc, or have a limit, however, if you have someone that is rather Bitcoin Rich that lives close to you, you could always split your money around  and buy all that you can locally?

This is a really hard question to answer, as it is not known how many people own bitcoins etc. But the best thing to do is how much the average person would own if everyone had bitcoins which can easily be done by:
    Total amount of Bitcoins ever / World population.
So at this moment in time, the sum would be approximately:
    21,000,000 / 7,000,000,000  = 0.003 BTC.
So if the whole world had bitcoins, and they were spread evenly amongst the world, 0.003 would be the amount that everyone would have. 
P.s. Sorry I wasn't able to answer your actual question, it's just impossible to do it correctly.

I think you have to have gold to have this feature, I would deem that fair enough as most escrows do either that or you tip them. For what we are doing the fixed percentage would be much better!

Maybe that everyone is a little on edge of the price of BTC and could potentially sell or buy so they are mashing their F5 key?

Alternatively to whosethere's suggestion, you could use mtgox and check the ticker there. High = highest of the day, low is lowest of the day and last is what you would like to be looking at for the actual price. There is also a service called [preev]( Thanks - Matt.

Holy, this is crazy, I mean there are many copies of these types of cards that are pre-loaded with bitcoins, but this is just a whole new level, I mean, you have cards with pre-loaded ASIC Miner shares, that is absolutely crazy! I mean seriously man, that must have taken ages to perfect! I really really like the design on the cards, very modern, sleek and up-to-date! 
Also, something you have over the competition would for sure be the alt-coin cards, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS!

Personally, I feel that Satoshi wouldn't be the NSA, I feel that he would be far more against the government. I mean, if you were to start a currency, you would have to have some pretty strong economical views that would more than likely be against your current currency. Governments said that the internet would never take off, if they believed this, I doubt they would ever make a currency that would then lose them money due to the varied rules of taxation on Bitcoins.

It really depends. If say it collapses due to an increase in supply so it devalues, then people will look to an alternative, or substitute good. Therefore they could put their money into something like Bitcoins, if they have heard of them, or other currencies may become stronger.

Hey, I am a 16 year old that got into Bitcoins when I was 15. I am pretty heavily involved with them, and have some myself. I can guarentee you that it is a heck of a ride, there are huge highs, and depressing lows, but I guess that is the same with everything. What I would say is only invest how much you are willing to lose, that is the key to success. For some of your other questions, I made a website that should be able to help you out, it answers almost all, if not all of your questions.  Also, you have very good English skills, I learned French in school and I am thankful that was able to just pass it, so well done on you! 
I will use Google translate to help you out! 
Hé, je suis un vieux de 16 ans qui a obtenu en Bitcoins quand j'avais 15 ans. Je suis assez fortement impliqué avec eux et avoir une moi-même. Je peux vous garantissons que c'est un diable d'une promenade, il ya d'énormes hauts et des bas, déprimant, mais je suppose que c'est la même chose avec tout. Ce que je dirais est seulement investir combien vous êtes prêt à perdre, c'est la clé du succès. Pour certains de vos autres questions, j'ai fait un site qui devrait être en mesure de vous aider, il répond à presque toutes, sinon toutes vos questions.  En outre, vous avez de très bonnes compétences en anglais, j'ai appris le français à l'école et je suis heureux que pouvait juste passer, si bien fait sur ​​vous!

It's a little bit of both of what you said. Be it that they aren't regulated, the only thing that determines the price are the users and so if all of a sudden everyone jumps on the SELL SELL SELL bandwagon, well the price is going to go down really quickly, however, everyone could hold and it could continue to increase so that's why it's a bit of a risk..
Matt.

All right, I don't want to be rude, however Bitcoin has had a lot of scams, some of which I have been apart of and I would prefer that there wasn't any more. Could you prove that you do in fact have 2500BTC (for all those thinking that I am stupid even asking, it is better to give the man a chance to prove himself - just in case.) If so, then this post is very valid and well done you.

No problem, hope that it all works out for you in the end, thanks Matt.

* They also have a break down of it; "
* CydiaIPA made an article about it which would promote it a bit; "
* Also appfinder had a page on it that they rated it one of the top fitness apps; "
hope that that helps, Matt.

Great contest, hope that someone cracks it, however it isn't that much of a reward. ;)

"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind". In the UK the temperatures aren't even that bad, we get around 6 degrees over here, but I know, I would absolutely be lost if I didn't have a nice warm house to live in, especially at this time of the year. I don't see how a body of people can be so cruel and corrupt. To be honest, it's just disheartening, showing how people have evolved in the most unnatural way possible. Great idea with the "Property of SeansOutpost" Just make sure that the homeless people having that doesn't put them in any legal situations. If I were you, I would put trackers in those things to catch them fuckers. Also, you could have, "Jason King, saving our corrupt society, one bitcoin at a time." ;-)

@_date: 2013-03-26 19:10:25
No you aren't hurting them, if anything you are being good about it, as you are keeping them, rather than selling straight away like all the panic buyers! I would suggest that if the price does go high and you see something that you like out of a Bitcoin store for example computer parts, a tablet etc. Feel free to buy them as you will have to pay transaction fees to get it back into Dollars, Euros, Pounds and so it would be beneficial to buy the product in Bitcoins. 
Hope that helps, any further questions, don't hesitate to ask, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:35:41

@_date: 2013-03-24 01:48:27
No, there is never anyway to make something impossible. However if you are doing some "Dodgy" things on the internet, there are precautions which you can take; such as VPNs, TOR network, General proxy servers etc so that it is harder to find your IP address. Hope that helps, Matt.

@_date: 2013-11-07 21:35:52
I actually do feel sorry for you guys, I think the wired article really, really, really does sum up TradeFortress: "Here’s your digital-currency lesson of the day, courtesy of a guy who calls himself TradeFortress: “I don’t recommend storing any bitcoins accessible on computers connected to the internet.” This guy seriously needs to practice what he preaches because what he is preaching is utter bullshit from where I am looking at it. He has no right, to ever comment another bad word under anyone else's projects or websites, when he himself, cannot string together a secure website. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 21:28:53
This is pretty damn interesting. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 19:20:59
I guess so, haha! It's crazy, right!
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:31:13
This guy is amazing, seriously! Quick contextual information; I'm 15 and was looking for ways to get Bitcoins although I don't have Paypal as I'm not the age, so I asked Bass, could he help me out, I don't personally know him or anything, just saw that he was being a good person. When I messaged him, this was his reply;
 Hi Matt,
how about this: you donate $20 dollars to some charity/public service of your choice and show me the receipt, and i'll send you 1btc. Since 1BTC~=$35 right now, i think that's a more than a fair deal, and we at least help some folks in need in the process. let me know if you're fine with this.
and that's what sparked the whole thing! He later sent me this; 
come to think about it this gave me a nice idea. check in a while :)
So yes, Bass is one heck of an awesome guy!
@_date: 2013-09-29 10:14:43
Got it and replied, Miss! ;-)
@_date: 2013-08-01 12:44:47
Maybe I'll get to know you better then. ;)
@_date: 2013-03-02 21:30:55
Yes, that was once. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:11:33
Haha, that's no problem.
Peace, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 15:47:50
True, I hope it does dramatically alter the price of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:24:32
I don't think that it is so much copycats, more that they are all using the same wordpress plug-in so for example, there is another site called; " which uses the same plugin. However, I really do like the maths behind it, thanks for that. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:21
Not sure what to comment back on that, however I feel that I should do the same so: 


@_date: 2013-04-02 16:19:15
I believe that you are talking about a third of miners where in the pool BTCGuild and so they had to shift some of them as they were getting too much of the market?
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:52:41
Wait what? So did you have more than 19Bitcoins before hand?
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:43:32
I live in the UK and it is nearing impossible to get ahold of bitcoins. The only way that I have been able to purchase bitcoins was to put my trust within people and buy by online means, such as one person who took donations to charity for Bitcoins. It would be great to see a service within the UK that was quick and easy.
Thanks for everything, of you need to know anything else, please PM me.
@_date: 2013-03-02 14:41:23
I believe that that was only once, don't quote me on that. I don't see how we are living in a fantasy world, please do explain. In addition, why come onto and troll, I don't see the point in that, if you don't like them, avoid the sub-reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:55:47
Awesome, thanks. ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:56:22
Please be away of this, it looks like a scam. Take due diligence. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:51:47
I one hundred percent agree, we need to keep Bitcoins in circulation. I for one am saving up to buy something on [BitcoinStore]( One reason to buy would be so that I can get an awesome gadget, the second reason would be so that I can keep the company at their low prices! :)

@_date: 2013-12-02 16:56:36
I really don't see why you are done with Bitcoins. Selling it on Ebay was a very stupid idea, there are many websites out there that you can do it safely, CoinBase, BitStamp, LocalBitcoins to name but a few. You should be "done" with Paypal. 
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:30:19
That's awesome!

I will have a double spending mechanism in place to prevent against it.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:31:27
Yes, that would be a good idea and if you get really bored and end up with a lot of time on your hands, why not think of something you would like done with Bitcoins and make it happen by supporting the bitcoin community. If that does happen, be sure to give my guys over at a share of the gold, thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:09:03
Are you sure that you loaded the whole blockchain? If it isn't fully downloaded, the transaction won't come through. Were they sent to the right address to begin with? I believe there is a way to find it, something of a forensic search, but I am not entirely sure. No you cannot replicate the address. Bitcoins can't be resent, if nothing else of the above works, then I'm afraid the coins are lost.

Yea man, there are many things, I listed just a few others [here.]( Some of the things that I have purchased was a Bitcoin keyring, can't be without that. ;-) And donated to Seansoutpost every now and again. No, I prefer to purchase it in Bitcoins, as it is just far simpler. Also, I find the receiving bitcoins far simpler than using paypal, bank accounts, due to the age restrictions, so Bitcoin has helped me out a lot on my way to getting (hopefully) a car and driving lessons, all paid with my own money!

Yea, that's awesome that you bought a Jalapeno, good on you. Well you see, that's what I personally like about Bitcoins, the whole currency is a bit of a gamble, and it's one that I think has the potential to pay off. Additionally, no it isn't worth the money if you are breaking even, however then why not go for a rig that is gaining you more bitcoins that it costs to run them?

By wrong address do you mean that it wasn't sent to your proper bitcoin address? If so, what 112-Cn did was he "Bitcoin tipped" you, therefore you the bitcointip bot sets up a wallet for you to receive the bitcointips. If you go to and read the side bar there is an option called "documentation" where you can read about it. If you want to send the money to your own address in this thread, once you have accepted 112-Cn's tip, type something like +bitcointip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;your bitcoin address&gt; and that should be you :D

It would be tempting to set up something like this in my school, but I somewhat doubt that ~~many~~ anyone would know what Bitcoins are, and for sure wouldn't have any. But I must commend you, it is a super idea, perhaps a Candy4Bitcoin^tm business! ;)
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:17:27
Hahaha, little bit nervous about first escrow, hope everything goes smooth and accordingly! Thanks for the kind words ;)

Likewise, well, at least from what I saw from her account. As she said in something I was reading, she has to be professional in life and so on Reddit, she prefers to let her hair down. Maybe it was just for banter -- perhaps not the time for banter, but it would give a plausible excuse. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:18:08
Haha, thanks man, your comment made me laugh, +1 to you! :)

I shall ask some people and see what they say!;)

Just use something like blockchain or something and send them the money! :) Thanks, Matt. 
EDIT: Well played for spreading the word about Bitcoins, +1.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:33:01
My friend has come back and he is willing to do it for 1BTC per month, please contact me back if you need any more details or need to get in contact with him or anything, thanks Matt. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:50:39
Yes, get the old HDD and go to the start button and type in, %appdata% and look for the Bitcoin program. It may take a while to resync all of the blockchain, but give it time. If it says you have bitcoins, happy days, if not, at least you tried! :)
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:52:49
Haha, keep up with that!:)
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:13:38
Yes, I use Bitcoins! I am 16 and I have been in them for around a year or so now, so I started when I just turned 15. They are awesome to use and to get things with. The main reason for starting was that I wanted to learn more, and gain some at the same time, however, faucets just weren't doing it for me, it felt like you did a lot of work, for such a minimal amount. Like you, I have purchased the shares, I went for AsicMiner-PT when it was cheap, and I have done some jobs to earn some more bitcoins. I am yet to purchase a gift card, as Gyft doesn't work in the UK to my knowledge, nad passed on the mining devices, as I didn't want to mine myself (didn't see any warrant for it.) But it is nice to see younger people getting into Bitcoins, I know a tonne of 14 year olds that are actively into them, but 12 is a solid start, especially for the amount of items you have bought, and the amount you have invested, good on you! Keep up the good work, giving us teenagers a good name, eh? ;-)
EDIT: Just realized that you earned your 2.5BTC off of that's awesome news man! That's exactly why I started it, for people like ourselves that don't get much of an income to buy bitcoins with! Way to go!
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:59:07
All right, well, yes, of course I am going to call you a thief, you took money which was not yours. Also, before you come back at me with the "put yourself in my shoes" of course I would have gave it back, that's just common curtsy.  You say that if it was just one individual, you would give the money back, well technically, it is just one individual that owns JustDice, that's Dooglus, who has faced a lot setting up this website, including a whale who lost him around the $100,000 mark if I recall correctly. I really hope this is a troll, as it seems like your actions resemble that of a troll. Making others feel worthless, just so that you can feel better about yourself. I hope you feel good, honestly, I do. Personally, I couldn't live with myself for doing such a thing. It is people like you that tarnishes the good reputation that Bitcoin is building. Heck, even giving a little bit to a charity would have been better than to thief the entire amount yourself, for vanity items, it doesn't seem as if you are struggling to make ends meet. Anyway, I feel that my rant is over here, so in essence, you can do whatever you like with your money, on the question of do I think it was right, or would I do it if I were in your shoes, of course not. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 19:22:10
would you like me to use your pyramining so that you can get some rewards? Post the link!
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:40:49
Very nice! Proud to be the first one! ;)
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:50:27
Like that?
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:34:17
Somewhat. For instance,  this will be way higher than any other as no one can get their money out of gox, therefore pushing the exchange rate up. I would suggest either looking at CoinBase or Bitstamp. :) 
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:29:01
Are you actually kidding me, please just leave this sub-reddit right now. 
@_date: 2013-08-03 11:32:55
Yea, I could totally agree with you about ASICMINER shares, to be able to sustain what they had going at the start is and still will be very very hard. As you stated in the comments, those who bought at a good price, well, they have a pretty safe investment. Those who are buying now, maybe don't have the the safest investment, unfortunately. Of course, both of us could be wrong and the price to quickly shoot up to 6 bitcoins, very quickly. At least I won't have to worry seeing that as of this week, I have nothing to do with ASIC shares and I made my handsome profit, so I am happy. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:17:52
Yes, I think this is a great idea! 
Here would be my view / guide for giving them: 
* Make sure it's a paper-wallet, they are the best in my opinion. You could just use the conventional ones from  or you could make it comical and go with the Doctor Evil ones, 
* I would make sure to write the amount at which you purchased them at, so that they have a fair idea of how much they have. 
* Also include a couple of exchanges to compare the price against, such as Bitstamp, CoinBase, etc. 
* I would also mention to make sure to hold onto it for as long as you possibly can and store it in a safe place.
I think that would be about it, no need to sugar-coat it, it's a good enough present on it's own, if I got it for Christmas, I would be very happy! ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:16:20
Additionally, it gets rid of all the panic sellers.
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:01:42
That's good, hope all goes well, I was about to offer you some Bitcoin, however see that you have them now, good luck with the transaction, thanks Matt.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:30:52
I'm guessing that your life wasn't too badly effected due to the price cut, actually you probably somehow benefited off of it! 
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:11:55
Looks like an awesome project, don't see how you have that much money to just throw around, however that isn't the issue. I am definitely going to have a look at this, even though it is probably beyond my comprehension, it seems dead interesting! 
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:39:56
It seems that Bitcointip is having a hard time processing the orders at the moment, I'll message you when I get mine through! You can purchase things on sites such as; Bitmit, you can buy people for employment on you can do anything really, just ask some of the guys on the sub-reddit! 
EDIT: You can also now buy Reddit Gold with it!:)

AH, about time Mr. Jason, but of course, it is for a great cause and I am glad to see how far you have been able to come in what seems to be such a short time. Keep up the good work, as per usual, and just keep doing what you do!

I'm willing to do escrow if anyone needs it, no charge, if you like to, you can send a tip, but that's all, if you have any doubts or anything message me, here is the escrow address for anyone that needs it: 
Thanks for making my first escrow so smooth guys, hope that everyone is satisfied with their coins, must say that I am rather jealous, however, have fun and if you ever need an escrow, hit me up!

How are you guys getting the identifiers?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:14:33

@_date: 2013-03-06 16:55:05
You could try [Bitinstant]( 
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:12:34
All right, well, it wasn't intentional, at all. It wasn't a ploy to get him to gamble, it was a flaw. I am not "bitching" I merely stated my opinion on the situation. Additionally, if the people who "ruin" their lives from Gambling, they had a choice whether to gamble or not, they chose to gamble, therefore they are accepted that it may or may not become addictive. That's fair enough if you call me an idiot, that's your opinion.

I meant for the year, sorry, I changed it.
@_date: 2013-08-01 12:34:21
That is 100% NOT what I was going for, these people have genuinely been there for me, helping me get a hang of the ropes, helping me out on other things such as moderation on my sub-reddit (That is seriously not what I was going for, and if you thought that, I am very sorry. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:15:58

@_date: 2013-11-01 16:56:13
Yes, I have never worked with shortcode, but maybe you will have the bases down for the most part? :)
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:45:52
Haha, "beggars can't be choosers, right?:)" Totally! : - ) 
We were also able to get altcoin tip enabled on which is great!
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:10:04
Hmm... I created this website:  and it displays the bitcoin price, I believe that is all you are looking? I am willing to give you the code for this if you like? :)

@_date: 2013-06-28 13:04:36
If you have a look there, if you use the bitcoin-qt, then you have an option to sign message which then you can confirm that you are in possession of the address. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:17:42
Wow man, what are you doing, that's way way too generous, thanks a bunch! I love you long time!

Coinbase, from what I have seen hasn't really been doing so well. Personally I would prefer to go with MTGox, as they are pretty instantaneous however there is a small fee to put your order in. I think it's great that you are willing to put that amount of money in and hopefully you shall get a return out! Here are some answers to questions that you may have; [Reddit Article](
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:03:45
Do you have the address handy?
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:36:36
Yea, I wouldn't worry about him, he obviously is either new to Bitcoins, or really hasn't looked into them. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:45:34
The orders just got process, to change it to Paypal I believe you go to BitInstant, however the site is down at the moment, anyone feel free to correct me. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:41:43
I do, I would prefer to keep my reputation intact. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:03:54
Hey, I'm 16(yesterday coincidentally), and I myself am going to buy an RPI with Bitcoins, as a very nice Redditors donated money for me to buy one. So this is great news. 
Some of the sites that I would recommend would be: 
* CodeAcademy. 
*  html.net.
* w3schools.
* jsfiddle (IDE)
* Generally browse around Also, if he gets good and would like to earn some Bitcoins for himself, send him over to hopefully someone would desire his skills! 
Thanks, Matt. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 17:20:49
Well, the reason for me thinking that some many people would buy bit coins is that they are unusual, some people may feel that because they don't exist, they are worthless, others may say that because they don't exist plus we have the ability to make them ourselves, that it opens a world of opportunity up to them. Perhaps it is the risk of all the bit coin servers being hacked and the price of inflation of the safe bet that the servers will never be hacked as there is so much encryption put on them. Who knows, everyone has their own separate opinion. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 08:50:59

@_date: 2013-10-08 17:56:20
