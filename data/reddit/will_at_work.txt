Oh God, I was already anxious about my order going through. Have you heard of this happening to other people? It seems anyone who bought in the last week from them would have a similar experience with the current trend of rising btc price? Maybe since I only bought 1 I will be less risk?

Yes, it says it's supposed to arrive "around" thursday. I was hoping that was just an estimate, and I might get it early. I know that I wont be charged any more, I just want to use the bitcoin before it goes down in value from where it is now.

I've read some accounts of this happening, but afaik, it is more rare for this to happen than to get your coins. I bought at $150, and got mine at $198 with no problem. From what I've read, there is no person determining the "high risk", it is a computer. They have a good history of if you email them saying you were marked as 'High risk' and explain the situation, they will "white list" you, and give you your coins at the price you originally locked in. I know this wont help you get your coins while the price is $205, but at least you'll have them for 145 instead of 170 or wherever the price is now. I just wanted to post this so people dont see a string of only hate on coinbase, when there is a lot of people with positive experiences

Recently? I bought last friday, supposed to get my bitcoin tomorrow... I'm gonna be furious if they cancel my transaction at the last minute.

I have the opposite problem. Bought bitcoin last friday for $150, but I wont have access to it until thursday. I'm seeing these high prices and being so impatient. I'm going to be so mad if on thursday the price is back down, when if I had gotten my bitcoin faster I would have made a quick $60 for doing nothing. I suppose if the price keeps going up, then I can thank the system for making me wait that long, because otherwise I would have sold it before thurs and lost out on the extra gain. Still... I'm super impatient to get my coinage and use it before it has a chance to go down in value

Apparently you can use debit card now, as well as credit.
