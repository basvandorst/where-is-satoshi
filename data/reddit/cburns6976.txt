I love what you said. Fact is, until people start to use it as a true form of currency instead of watching the market they are hoping for, it will always be viewed like a stock market game for profit.
Today, people get rich and depend on "The Market" for employment as well as retirement. (401k, IRA, Incentives through companies profiting from the stock market, ect.) The richest people *play* the stock market. The rest depend on that market via entrepreneurs, franchises, and banks.
The crypto-world is no different, financially speaking, except for the major ones such as complete decentealization and global understanding/acceptance. It was originally used as currency via black market goods. That's why there was no *Institutional sized* backing. The big players back then were just exchanging *currency* for *commodities* they wanted untracked.
The difference is, we use money so much it effects the markets in various manners that solidifies the stable nature of fiat cash.
This is the true threshold that needs to be surpassed imo. It's not a market goal.. Our market is stable. The awareness is a VERY crucial element, but the next largest contribution to the widespread adoption (The market benefits immensely, as well ) of cryptocurrency will be to start directing these forums and advocacy toward places to spend it. The more it's used, the less the market can be controlled by market giants.

Tough crowd.. lol
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:25:43
Yes. Not just products, but enterprises and vital systems, as well. That's not my point though. This is about decentralized Bitcoin. I was just curious people views on whether they see this as another attack on crypto or a step towards a favorable adoption?
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:55:38
Exactly. So, that being said, will we or will we not know when the last btc has been mined?
Edit: I screwed up the word "know".. :/
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:03:12
And I agree with what you're saying, don't get me wrong. I just like to bounce what I've researched off of others who are well versed to double check my understanding of the technology and implementations.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:28:44
I'm calling bullshit. Call me an idiot if it makes you feel better.. I'll call you a fanboy..
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:00:56
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:44:47
So, the answer is yes. Thanks. See, I support improvements. That's what leads to solution. BCH claims to have found the "solution" which to me, means they just haven't ran into a problem they must disclose. Don't get me wrong, I support their vision as well, but it doesn't offer the flexibility of changing with adaptation and boasts it's platform based on its outreach.. Not computer science solely. I'm not the most well versed person on blockchain, but I really hope the solution is found in a solid way so crypto can thrive as a decentralized means of currency.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:49:13
Oh okay. That makes sense. Bad apples always ruin a good thing.. The concept itself isn't what makes it centralised, rather the actors compromising it's potential. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:51:42
I agree with your sentiments, but I'm still entitled to be pissed with what the "natural reaction" is and how it's being handled.. Doesn't make my opinion "bs" lol
I do appreciate your perspective though. Interesting take on the situation. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:12:03
Lol. Simple misunderstanding then. No big deal.

De facto rulers of the world. ;)
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:59:33
You draw some crazy conclusions. I don't even know what reality you live in. I'm done here.. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:59:33
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:23:51
This shit is getting ridiculous.. I agree that Bitcoin is THE bitcoin and BCH is basically an altcoin, but NONE of this fued is helping crypto adopt as a whole... Point the the finger whichever way they want and I still say they have BOTH been corrupted by the fiat value of digital currency.. They are setting adoption back and I'm pissed at both sides.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:09:51
Are you suggesting the algorithm and control methods that have been put in place, via the blockchain technology for cryptocurrency, are somehow controlled by a certain entity or something? lol
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:10:33
So, in a basic sense, is it supposed to scale up and adapt over time? I understand it's by block "weight" vs block "size" per say, but is that what's supposed to happen eventually of its own accord?
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:09:31
Okay. :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:09:45
I read all kinds of "crap" on Reddit.. lol
But I think you misunderstood me..
I'm not a Bcash fanboy by any means. I was sincerely asking about the network as it pertained to the post.. I will always back the OG BTC, but I'm not opposed to any idea of progressing the platform in terms of adoption and sustainability.
On a different (also sincere) note, isn't Ethereum a nice addition to the blockchain network? It's in no way, shape, or form like bcash imo. I thought the smartcontracts were a solid way to implement a business infrastructure based on blockchain technology? What's the downside to Ethereum and how is it centralized?
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:25:26
You'll have to finish the question. lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:24:22
First of all, you don't freak out when a fire occurs...
You put it out before it spreads..
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:01:24
Just reciprocating back what I interpreted. Even after rereading it, it seems you are saying that PoW is prone to centralization, which is why they are switching to PoS. The only way I can see PoW being centralized is through corporate giants buying up the resources used to mine. Did I get that wrong?  
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:19:12
....riiiigghtt. :/ 
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:40:59
Also... Is BCH an "Alternative" to Bitcoin? It certainly won't replace it... BUT if it did, (it won't) would that not be an "alternate coin"?
I respect what BCH is doing, but I'm not going to abandon the platform this was created on because Roger Ver said it was destined to fail.. Slow adoption &gt; No adoption
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:38:48
Technologically.. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:44:15
This was the point I was conveying as well...
And the downvotes are just solidifying it. :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:27:54
I responded to your other comment an hour ago telling you I've used your daddy Ver's network.. Don't get all worked up defending your golden idol, because I corrected your typo.. If I wanted any comeback from you, I'd wipe it off your lip mf..
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:15:13
Sounds like Gavin Belson. lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:35:16
I'm sort of new to this sub and it's a genuine question.. I've been following crypto for years and I haven't seen a single person on this sub opposed to genuine questions with doubt or concern. I saw that and I'm starting to think r/btc really has issues..
I would like to see this happen just to prove them wrong, but with the propaganda I've also witnessed... It could be a ploy by an altcoin to get ammo, because there isn't much bad news about the original crypto..I mean bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:00:11
- What YOU think is correct:
"I'm just asking a question, if *your* unable to answer it..."
-The correct way:
"I'm just asking a question, if *YOU'RE* unable to answer it..."
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:40:51
Of course.. People hand it out like candy using Tippr. Doesn't make it a solid "solution" nor does the constant battle further crypto as a whole.. To say it has NOTHING to do with Roger Ver is asinine.. lol (I won't stoop to your level by calling people "idiots", because I have some degree of respect for others..)
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:50:47
I can't, of course. lol However, that's not an impossible feat for Oil tycoons.. That's the primary resource controlling electric production plants and GPU production plants. They can both be cornered simultaneously by a single proprietor. That's already happened tbh. The "petro-dollar" has inverse and adverse effects on a very large array of markets and renewable energy still can't compete with said control. That's where I thought you were going with what you said about PoW. I have seen several corporate giants invest heavily in large scale mining rigs, putting strain on the little guy  while also driving up the price of Gpu's and the semiconductor market as a whole. That's not the point you were making though and I get what you mean. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:36:21
...because the fued is  one of the main reasons it's even being referred to in that manner? I don't think it's off base to call that aspect out, but it may be misunderstood.. Not a big deal. I agree with the majority in that aspect. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:01:31
Bold statement. Furthers my point though. You BCH trolls speak without knowledge and only care about one thing...
 Hint: It isn't the currency Satoshi envisioned.
Let me stop perpetuation the exact thing I was just speaking out against and being hypocritical, because you're being critical... smh
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:17:16
Watch out... I got called a cock sucker for correcting that VERY word. lmao
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:17:26
Hey man... It was captured with my phones broken camera lens.. Not a screenshot. Lol
...still looks terrible. :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:25:23
I guess you still think I'm disagreeing with you on this.. Bitcoin is bitcoin, Btc is bitcoin... Bitcoin is THE only bitcoin.. I even referred to BCH righteously as an altcoin..because it's not bitcoin.. lol We are on the same page with that, but I just don't think arguing amongst the two is providing any constructive aspect to the problems facing adaptation, adoption, or sustainability of Cryptocurrency as a whole. It may be a necessary evil to combat it now, but it's undeniably delaying progress to some immeasurable degree. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:13:29
Though I hope that's true, it wasn't my words necessarily. That was out of the mouth of Roger at the end of the video in this article on Forbes.
He was screaming about how BTC is killing babies and this fued was delaying BCH from reaching 3rd world countries, thus delaying the adoption YEARS for all  Cryptocurrencies..
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:45:08
Funny. Next post was this. lol

@_date: 2018-04-25 09:53:53
They say it's a "Mid-market" average across several exchanges, but I think you're right. It's not such a bad fee though from my one purchase experience and it's pretty convenient and easy to send to my electrum wallet....but I think I'm still missing something. I was thinking i would be able to move it from my wallet and sell it on a normal exchange at higher than CashApp would buy it back at.

@_date: 2018-04-26 01:01:34
It was just to try it out and see, but you can buy up to 10k I believe and move to a private wallet with no fees.. Still need an exchange if I'm wanting to sell them for a better price or trade for alts, It seems like an okay price for buying, but I couldn't imagine selling on there. Just dabbling with different places to buy crypto before havong a large chunk eaten by fees, but I plan on HODLing either way.. I have Kraken, but I haven't made time to get a wire transfer started.

Why do people not understand that? lol If you don't know that you can buy smaller amounts of BTC...You should do a little more research before trading anything.. Not to turn anyone away, but it IS your money after all. ����
