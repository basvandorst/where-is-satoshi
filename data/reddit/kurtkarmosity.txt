It's the same person that gave him the 37 yesterday.

I'm young (24) have a house, 2016 truck, and I could deal with moving back into my parents if anything goes tits up ��. Tbh I think I jumped the gun getting a house at this age, even though I can afford it. Have been for a year now.

The twitter account has tweeted about sending both amounts with proof so idk
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:06
You could always go with option 1, but in addition to that put extra money in on the dips if you want. That's what I plan on doing if I can control my spending ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:13:32
Wouldn't even be mad. I can get a whole coin finally! Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:58:56
And how do I go about reporting it after I get the complete list? Would I take it to the same guy I take all my other taxes to come tax time?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:22
I am not really crypto literate so I might not be the best to answer, but I always buy dips, hell, I always buy in general tbh. Blockfolio is nice because you can set price alerts and I do huge ranges to track drops.

The retirement that has a decent possibility of being worth nothing by 2055? As I said in my reply to the other guy, I'm just playing devils advocate with this, but it might be true. However, in the event the USD is worth nothing, I feel like wed have a lot more things to worry about than money. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:17:04
Loving the dip, gonna set alerts to see where it stops at
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:16
Coinbase definitely showed 14.5~ twice for me tonight but when I went to buy it was 15.5~, trying to catch it lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:06
That's what I heard in October when I only needed 5700...
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:23:17
When exactly would be the best time for one to say "ok this is how much I've made in profit so far"? With the volatility it would never be an accurate number.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:27:19
Would seem that way to me. but that isn't what I was referring to, I was more referring to those that don't even have anywhere close to 20k total holdings. 
Also I thought the IRS only got ahold of accounts that were trading $20k+ per trade, not total overall trades. You could trade 1k 20 times but that doesn't mean you'll have anywhere near 20k by the end of the trades.

"Scam" yup not worth giving any credible response.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:00
Rent out the other rooms in my house, only end up paying about 400/month myself
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:05:07
Yeah, from here on out I'm not converting and I'll only be buying from my debit account. AFAIK, The initial buy of bitcoin or any alt, not a sell and buy or convert, isn't taxed. I'm just printing out my transaction history and taking it to my tax guy during tax time.. it's treated like any other investment from what I gathered.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:52:13
Yes I was accounting for the fees and such from withdrawing from the beginning. But do you really think how the $ is going now, it will be even remotely worth it in 2055(targeted retirement fund)~? I'm just playing devils advocate with this question but it has to make you think.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:10:00
I can't see how anyone but yourself is going to know what you have if you never cash out on anything, but maybe I'm just being dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:45:09
I think I might take like a 50% chance instead of going all in. I'd hate to be like 55 or something and regret not taking the chance. Even if taking the chance now means it might NOT work.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:25
Been debating the same thing OP, 24, have 22k in my current 401k, and fully intend on working for another 41 years. I honestly can't see it being a terrible choice, but I haven't made the jump yet. Hell some people our age don't even have 401k's.. I'm also paying a mortgage and car loan single and having no issue buying btc.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:17:53
Lmao, my home life was good, not saying yours wasn't,  but it's not like I'm incapable of living on my own. I've done what very few in this age range do. Honestly one of the only reasons I haven't considered selling the house, have an all original 1970's muscle car in the garage and there'd be nowhere for it if I sold.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:49:08
I've kept a typed log of each time I bought bitcoin with my own money from my bank. I've sold some, bought some back, sold, bought another coin etc. this was all done with the USD wallet option in Coinbase, I've not yet even thought about pulling anything out. The transactions are all there on Coinbase. But the "gains" at the time of the sales aren't reflected with what is currently in my entire holding. I'm by no means a big player here, less than .1 bitcoin. What in the hell am I supposed to do lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:14:01
Thought about it, where I live couldn't find anything standalone like that, they were all a part of a group of places for rent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:56
Coinbase still down for me
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:18:54
I know about that, I'm referring to those that do less than 20k, which I feel like might be the majority of users? I'm not sure.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:44:36
I'm in for the long haul, enjoying the ride! If I lose it all so be it
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:54:32
I might have to stay up all night to watch this...
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:36
I already have some fraction of bitcoin, but I felt like it might be better to get more, sooner while it's lower. Was going to do this at 5k and passed on it...
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:41:18
Just got the notification for it being down for maintenance until 1am PT
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:05:43
Would it be better to pull 10k from my small 401k and buy a coin or just redistribute my 401k and put a good bit if it into say, GBTC?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:39:57
Can instant sell with the USD wallet on Coinbase, and buy fromm that Wallet as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:19:30
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:12:56
EXACTLY what I said
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:20:18
Would've yesterday but Coinbase was screwing me around with verification and being so overloaded..
