By 'you" you must mean "you" as in This is a handicap of yours that you should not extend to other software developers.  I feel sorry for your clients or whomever you're working for.
If builders had to work like you, they'd have to partially tear down their buildings every time something the implemented didn't meet the required spec, which is what I imagine you must do on your coding work.  Design, up-front testing, experience etc. can help minimize the need for that mode of operation. 
tl;dr: Not everyone works the same way.  Don't map your handicaps on the rest of the world and assume something is impossible just because you can't do it.

The dialog was barely comprehensible.  I think education in the Bitcoin space may need some work if this is what some "financial experts" perceive about this technology, and are spreading to a major market on a talk major radio station.
That said, there was no excuse for thinking the Bitcoin market cap was $1 Trillion USD, so maybe education will not help everyone.  If you can't be bothered to do a google search before spouting nonsense there's not much we can do.
Edit: BTW, bitcoin "discussion" starts at around 13:00.

I'm curious, you must be an avid bitcoin user to even know what purse is and to jump through the few hoops to use it, and according to this post you must have used purse before, so why do you have no reddit history aside from what you've posted in this thread?
The funny part is, every positive comment here was from long time reddit users and are being brigaded down, and the vast majority of negative comments are coming from fresh accounts.
No shilling going on here I suppose?
@_date: 2016-08-25 06:33:39


You are making the assumption that the 1000+ orders fulfilled are being fulfilled at that very high markup.  I don't see the data that indicates that.  It's an assumption not a fact.


I admit those markups are lower than I have seen at other sites where it seemed as if card sellers were taking a 5 to 15% hit.  I did some research a while back.  Perhaps it was for a specific card and not an amazon card which is more versatile than say a Gap card.  Still, as the site FAQ explains, some people have amazon credit, earned for example via Mechanical Turk, but don't have access to Amazon deliveries, and presumably don't have access to the international transfer that would be required to sell their cards via the sites you provided.


There is tight regulation via banking compliance officers monitoring all personal bank account activity that affects those using ACH based exchanges.  As opposed to earners buying something via purse which is a much higher burden to track it down.  It would look to an outsider that they simply bought something at amazon.  Digging deeper via subpoenaing amazon's data it could be determined that they placed an order for someone else (wish list) and to get beyond that they'd have to personally track down the recipient and question them, or would have to know about purse.io and subpoena their data.  The two scenarios are not the same by any stretch.  I'd even expect that some people would use purse as a way to acquire bitcoin that is lower risk to their bank accounts as some people have had their bank account shut down for using bitcoin exchanges.

You don't see the logical flaw in this statement?
"Since I saw that red car going 100mph once, I can only assume the car can only drive at 100mph."  Stop being ignorant.


For example? 
Where did I make an assumption?  I'm describing possible use cases that are somewhat unique to Purse that can explain it's existence and survival for years now.  I'm also a user and have had 0 negative experiences out of tens of transactions (only buys - the supposedly riskier side of the deal).
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:37:42
I've used it in the tens of times and only ever had a "earner" back out, 2 maybe 3 times.  The site automatically relisted my order so the only negative effect was getting a notification that my order had already been placed when soon after that partucular order was cancelled.
I'm not sure why people are having so many negative experiences.  Also if you look at the "Earn" page you can see that there are quite a few people there with hundreds and even thousands of fulfilled orders.
TL;DR: The rumors of this being a scam site are greatly exaggerated as evidenced by it's longevity and of course my personal experience and the apparent experience of others seen on the site.
@_date: 2016-08-27 02:38:08
In general I agree with you, but when you check out the comment history in this thread and the lack of logic and surplus of FUD spewing from then check "his" comment history (nothing outside this thread), it's clear something is up.
You can call me a shill but just look at my comment history.  I have no affiliation with purse other than I like their service.  I have defended them a few times before when other's have IMO overstepped from raising questions and concerns to slander.
If you look at the profile for the other positive reviews on this thread it's also clear that most if not all have been redditors for over a year or 2, some as many as 9.  Even sympathetic reviews suggesting their experiences were positive (certainly as valid as the OP) are being down voted to negative numbers. That's not normal or constructive so I presume something else is up.  Maybe a purse competitor is about to launch (great I think competition in the space would be beneficial - just behave instead of employing slander) or perhaps a general anti-bitcoin FUD patrol is on duty and purse is a pretty popular and compelling entry point to bitcoin, so therefore potential target.
If a bunch of people came to reddit and started slandering your favorite cafe/restaurant/[insert service here] say, you'd probably try to present another perspective, and perhaps would even be suspicious if good faith comments were getting brigaded.  That's all I'm doing.

You're just way off.  It's really embarrassing.  I write software and have been for likely longer than you've been alive, and most times I know exactly how I will implement it before I write the code.  I can consider what possible ideas will work, won't work, before I start writing a single line.  The overall design comes first in the form of mental representation, flow charting, wire-framing etc., feasibility testing, then the code.  Sometimes the code will need to change if the design wasn't complete enough, which is the only stretch by which any of your nonsense makes even a lick of sense.
Your statements are equivalent to saying "a bridge is only feasible when it's actually built and there is no way to know if the bridge will hold the desired weight, withstand natural forces, last for 50 years etc. without building it first."  This is of course pure BS and factually incorrect.
What a waste of time.  And you've asserted everything with reckless authority as if you know what you're talking about.

You are making many assumptions.  Purse has released statements that they actively work at fraud detection and prevention.  If they had an unusual amount of fraud, which some of the posts in this thread and others I've seen suggest, they'd have been shut down a long time ago.  They are not exactly a deep web site.  The founder is easily reachable.
Also, they offer a $10,000 guarantee to anyone that does have an issue, for example if they get investigated as the recipient of a purchase made with a stolen credit card.
@_date: 2016-08-27 02:22:34
It's posed in the form of a question rather than a statement.  Based on what goes on in I think the question is valid even if the title is a bit click-baity.
I'm quite fond of the guy and have given him the benefit of the doubt in my own personal assessment of him.  I'd really like to know his underlying motivations.  
I can't reconcile statements he's made that seem to indicate he's either being intentionally obtuse or perhaps is just not technical enough to understand the issues underlying the block size discussion.  I had previously assumed he is technical enough to understand that talking about hard drive space is not at all relevant to the debate, yet I've seen posts where he's suggested just that.  So it's hard to come to another conclusion than he must be playing some sort of game.  Again, I hope I'm wrong and there is some consistent rational explanation but I've yet to see it.
I think the OP is posting in good faith and is similarly puzzled by Roger's behavior. 
Btw, I was perma-banned in for a minor infraction that should have gotten me nothing more than perhaps a few days' ban.

So you checked every day this month and those orders were the only orders those users had on?  Even if you did check every day this month it's likely those people built their order history over the last year.  You are making a giant leap to get to your "equivalent".


Yeah, that's easy.  You mean other than lbc?  Lbc has risks that using purse does not.  And I'm sure there are risks using purse but they seem to be overblown in this thread, and they offer that $10,000 protection.


Yes, and usually a high markup and not everywhere amazon orders can be placed by a huge stretch.

Just to be clear, that's not what I was suggesting or supporting.  Larger blocks are on the radar, just not until the scalability plan is more complete.  You seem to be calling for it to have already happened.  I was not.
Core's plan makes sense to me.  Big blocks now is a short term hack, not a solution.  In combination with a real scaling solution, and other improvements (like recent progress on shorter relay times), larger blocks make more sense.
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:16:44
Do you have evidence to back your claim or is "undoubtedly" all you can muster?  I saw one post about such an experience a year ago.  That's pretty good for the number of orders they are processing.  Hell it's pretty good based on just the number of orders I've placed.

Or they post orders at various discounts as you can see is the case on the Earn page right now.  So some of the lower discount ones get fulfilled while likely the high discount ones don't, at least as often.


Yes, and at what discount?


Or people don't want to buy their potentially future valuable bitcoin on an exchange.  It's more off the radar via purse which justifies a larger discount.  Why do people pay 10-15% at BTMs?

You refer to a Part 2 that doesn't seem to exist.  You published Part 1 about 9 months ago.
Regarding: 
"They don't even need to keep a database." 
"I show the photo, she sees me. We see that transaction happened on the blockchain."
So without Target having a database how did you get from a **shown** photo to the exact digital copy required to get you to the public address for verification on the blockchain?
Where is that answered?  I see people asking similar questions in the YouTube comments but you respond with hand waving.
Also, you don't even go into how you put the payment itself on the blockchain.  You only went into getting the id verification on the blockchain. Are you suggesting that is a separate process?  You seemed to be suggesting all you do is walk in and show your face and a picture of yourself - done.
Also, ["The anonymous freaks"]( - so while you claim this:  you call people who want to be anonymous "freaks".
It would seem a lot easier to show everyone how smart you are while simultaneously shutting up "the aggro troll" by just answering the questions and supporting your own idea.  It shouldn't be this hard to get you to fill in the blanks.  If you can't do it then I assume there is no merit to this idea.

Just so we understand, a middle man tier is required in your scenarios how?
Right now the government takes a piece of every profitable transaction every time that happens in a trackable way (electronic vs. as cash).  The assertion seems to be that the waste associated with taking that piece is gigantic when aggregated.  This doesn't even take into consideration the compounding cost when those middle men use those collected funds to create millions of pages of law, hundreds of thousands of lecherous jobs (government and government related - lawyers, clerks, EPA staff etc.) local licensing and compliance requirements etc., the hidden costs of monetary inflation and manipulation all of these corrupting and warping the collective intelligence of millions of independent actions.

Great points.  The complicity of people these days to agree to a system that monitors their every move like babies is astounding to me.  I'm encouraged to see some amazing comments on this post by people who clearly understand that government is out of control.  "Free trade" should mean between people, free of the government vig.  It should be clear that people and economies at large would thrive if unleashed.
The older I get the more I conclude government is nothing more than a mafia.  The sad part is I think it's a multi-layered mafia with the people at the bottom, the state in the middle (all layers of state stooges) and the central bankers above them.  This has got to change.  I hope we can leverage these new tools to invert that monstrosity and banish the filth that's been manipulating the citizens for their own means.

You're cute with your insult attempts.  He's intentionally or unintentionally misleading people into thinking identity is the answer Bitcoin needs when it's likely just the opposite.

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but the Federal Reserve (in the US) is a shadowy organization that people like Ron and Rand Paul have been trying to get a light shed on for years.  IMO they use politicians and other people like pawns and perhaps are pawns themselves of a global banking cartel.  So short answer, "no".
I think the one good piece of news regardless of who the attacker is, is that it should be apparent that Bitcoin is perceived as a threat which proves it's significance.

Let's use this as a real life example of how idchains work since you seem very familiar with the topic, you imply you understand it.  So please use idchains to prove this is a picture of you.
1. First step hash the image to create a private key (I can do that too since you sent me a link).
2. Second step, generate a public key/address from the private key (I can do that too).
3. Third step pay some bitcoin to the address?

I know exactly why which is why I'm criticizing it.  Bitcoin doesn't need (edit: that kind of) identity.  As a matter of fact the anonymity/pseudonymity of it is part of its value prop.

@_date: 2016-04-22 06:28:40


Using those cameras you spoke of on your video James, identifying you with facial recognition, is not voluntary.
Similar example, for instance here I simply used your unique overly defensive argument style (I knew it would surface eventually) and a unique expression to ID you and tie you to your shill accounts.  It's obvious you like "anonymity" under certain circumstances.  You're making the point of your detractors on this issue.  Also, apparently you "ain't got the balls" to post as yourself to support your own ideas James:

@_date: 2016-08-19 05:21:24


Presumably when you wrote the code the first time you were paid and when you "press the backspace key a bunch of times and type in something else" you were paid again, so yes it is equivalent.  You built something, tore it down and wrote it different the next time. Calling it an iteration is just a way of making it sound positive.
Face it, just because you can't design something in your mind, on paper etc. you should not assume that applies to others.
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:56:16

@_date: 2016-04-23 15:25:24
Yup, simple explanation.  Look at the date (6:32 AM - 21 Apr 2016).  This is in response, not a proactive unrelated declaration of his principled stance.  How odd that you need to point to a post that James made within the last 2 days and that he needed to clarify that so recently.  And if I'm such a conspiracy theorist why are others making the same observation and pointing it out to James?  Btw, even my initial comments on this very thread predate the tweet you posted.  This looks like damage control to me.  
Btw, are you saying that you are not a shill account for James'?  No affiliation?  A separate person posting from a separate IP right?  Just curious.
@_date: 2016-04-20 01:06:18
BitID and SQLR already solve identity in a less risky way.  James apparently loves the idea of de-anonymizing people.  He seems to be seeking governments as clients.  I tend to focus more on the individual and liberty.  Anonymity is generally a good thing on much of the Earth's surface.  Making IDs face based has some pretty significant pitfalls.  The other two projects I mentioned let the user have total control of their identities/personas.  Perhaps James has that base covered, but starting with one's picture seems to indicate the opposite.
@_date: 2016-04-20 01:55:12


Hmm.  That seems like a somewhat broad statement.  What are the use cases we're talking about?  The Walmart one seems like it would be perfectly served by the projects I mentioned.  Btw, James has been talking about identity as a requirement for bitcoin, suggesting it will fail otherwise, and I don't see it.  In fact I would think quite the opposite.


It sounds interesting and is worth investigating, but his posturing around it and suggesting it will be useful for governments makes me suspect of his world view and intentions.
I'll give you another list:
1. In general, people should not be able to be easily tracked using their faces.
2. Citizens should have the ability to be anonymous in most situations, especially from their government.
3. The power to identify someone and tie it to their assets, independently and together, has pros in certain situations but mostly cons for most people in most situations.
So, unless his system is individual focused and puts control in their hands then not so nifty.

That seems pretty consistent with D'Angelo's brilliant idea to put Bitcoin's trust in the hands of a "Congress of People".
You go James.  Be sure to give a shout out to all the representatives of the "people".  We're "super proud" of you too.  I'm also sure you'll have a receptive audience whose depth of knowledge and concern about bitcoin is limited to and focused on how to stop or control it to meet their own personal goals.  
A match made in Heaven.
Oh, I see where he's going with this...  The UN is the "Congress of People"!  James wants us to put Bitcoin's trust in the representatives of leaders (as opposed to citizens) from around the globe.  Perfect.  Even Putin will have a say.  I don't see any problem with that line of thinking.

@_date: 2016-04-20 17:10:27
I had watched it.  Perhaps since you must know you can just put it in plain terms.
Edit: for example, in the video the private key is derived from an image, which presumably is data you can lose just like the seed to your private keychain in any modern wallet.  So where does that benefit come in and how exactly can I reconstruct my private key if I lose that image?  If I take another picture of myself it will not produce the same key, as was demonstrated by James in his video via changing just one pixel.  
I'm honestly interested to see if there is merit to this idea.

Also funny that these accounts responding "on James' behalf", you know, the only ones getting downvoted, all praise or support James' ideas and come off as dismissive and authoritative (without providing actual answers), yet they have very little reddit history and are not very active.

It seems a bit inconsistent though to call it "privacy by default" if someone else can "de-anonymize a particular participant".  That seems more in line with the old seemingly government sponsored propaganda about only needing privacy if you're doing something wrong.
As others have pointed out, regardless of intent, if this could be applied to bitcoin it may be a flank attack to to speak, so for "supporters of the bitcoin community" to be working hard on something that may dent Bitcoin's armor is quite disturbing.  Adding permissions and/or centralization of control to a system who's primary value prop is being permission-less and decentralized is not "supporting".

They are not equal.  They are clearly mentally flawed.  I've had many an online and in person argument with them and they generally lack rationality, any semblance of reason.
1. They don't trust or want to kill the police but want them (and armies) to exclusively have access to guns.
2. They want equality but want to treat white males differently (and Asian's too, because of, you know, their privilege of having strong families and work ethic).
3. They want "free" things and to call them "rights" when rights can't require that another citizen is compelled to provide for or directly provide that "right".
4. They believe that a suicidal mass murderer will obey laws.
5. They are concerned with how many people are killed by guns, specifically "gun murders", rather than just murders as affected by gun ownership. (hint: it's because they can find no correlation between gun ownership and higher death rates - just gun death rates which is to be expected as more car accidents are to be expected in countries with more cars per capita).
6. They forget that 260+ million people were murdered by their own governments in the past 100 years and thing guns are protected in the 2nd amendment for hunting, not as a check against such tyranny.
7. They think that Islamism is consistent with Feminism and hijabs are a sign of women's liberation.
I can keep going.  We're talking about severely damaged people.
What I can't figure out is how someone can be for Bitcoin, a free market currency specifically designed to work around the manipulations of the state and at the same time look to the state like a parent or god to provider for them and to worship.

Because fiat inflation benefits Central bankers the most. Just like if you owned stock in a company and they secretly leaked some to you without public announcement and you sold it as if it was part of the originally issued shares. 
Add to that most people don't think to consider money issuance in the same ways as shares of stock and you have a recipe for massive corruption and public manipulation. 
I also theorize that central banks and governments are quietly eating the benefits of productivity gains. We would likely see massive price reduction as we do in technology products but more broadly across the board as more industries reap the benefits of that increased productivity. 
It's interesting to imagine what the world would look like and how cost of living would have been affected had out currency been backed. 
Others will suggest that without the influx of "cheap cash" we would not have seen as much industrial and technological growth. It's an interesting perspective but i generally think the market would make better choices than the corruptible (at least) central planners.

First, that is now what your linked post (by [deleted]) suggests and second, the post is an assertion not a proof.


This statement is what my follow up comment was directed at.  How can you suggest that you can take a good that is now being more productively produced due to massive improvements in technology (acreage yield, automation, energy advancements, logistics improvements etc.) should be able to be predicted accurately without factoring in the effects of those productivity increases?
IMO, the "official inflation" numbers calculations make the same mistaken assertion, likely intentionally, to take credit for low price inflation which is really more likely the result of increases in productivity than successful "monetary policy".

@_date: 2015-12-01 06:05:21
First, I wasn't suggesting we could predict what it would cost "in 5 years".  That seems to be a little straw man detail you've injected.  To be absolutely clear, I was suggesting that at present (or a future present) total hashing power can help you calculate the cost to take over the network.  My scenario was via purchasing/manufacturing hardware as that is one possible attack vector.  Clearly via that approach it's more expensive today than it was 2 years ago to acquire adequate hashing power.  There are other attack vectors, as you've suggested, a regulatory attack on existing hardware manufacturers or miners.  Perhaps for that attack vector distribution is more important than overall hashing power.  
So to my point of you looking at things too narrowly, I don't think you or I are qualified to even enumerate all the possible attack vectors, but clearly having more hashing power raises the bar more on some of them, like the one I outlined, and clearly having better distribution raises the bar more on others, like the one you outlined.
As I said in my original post, you seem to be oversimplifying things.  Both factors are important and just because you can come up with a scenario where more hashing power doesn't necessarily equate to more security for one attack vector doesn't make raw hashing power unimportant with respect to others.
For the record, I've been suggesting from the outset that both are important in different scenarios and you have apparently been saying that only the distribution is and that raw hashing power is largely irrelevant.  I think that sentiment speaks for itself.  If that's not a fair characterization please present in concise terms what your position is.

It seems to me the Shift card helps the inherent bootstrapping problem of low merchant adoption because of low user adoption and low user adoption because of low merchant adoption.  
By allowing users to, albeit indirectly, spend bitcoin everywhere where VISA is taken, we are at least reducing the barrier to user adoption as user's who earned or bought and HEDL bitcoin can now spend it at millions of merchants without that merchant having to take on any change in process/risk etc.  While it's imperfect, it seems to serve an important purpose that perhaps otherwise was being held up by the bootstrapping problem.  
I've seen numerous examples on reddit where early adopting merchants have decided to stop accepting bitcoin or perhaps just didn't have the usage to justify training their staff, keeping the tablet charged etc.  This approach requires zero investment on the part of merchants and immediately makes millions of them capable of indirectly accepting bitcoin.  In most cases they would have been unlikely to keep their earnings in bitcoin anyway so it just shifts where the exchange happens slightly.
Once merchants realize that some significant % of their users are using these new Shift cards or cards like them, they will be able to more clearly see the benefit of removing Visa/banks from the loop and accepting Bitcoin directly.  At that stage they will also know that even if they are an earlier adopter they themselves can spend what they've earned at millions of merchants.
Perhaps we should mention casually and in some interesting way that we are using Bitcoin. "Welcome to the world of Bitcoin."  Maybe someone could come up with a more catchy or appropriate phrase that would be likely to become a meme.  Maybe something more subtle that piques curiosity, like the Shift app could make a sound from out smartphone each time the card is used, like some bitcoin wallets do.  Perhaps a Bitcoin sticker on the face of the cards...
To me it seems like Shift is an elegant solution to a very difficult problem.  I think it can only increase user adoption and in no way inhibits users or merchants from deciding to use bitcoin directly.
Edit: typo.

I keep hearing this.  Hasn't anyone considered that this would perhaps shake the Euro as an institution?  Isn't Spain toying with default too?  Hasn't it lost 15+% of it's value against the USD over the past year?  Seems like bitcoin would be one of the legitimate options to consider as a hedge against that possibility.  Regarding gold, I agree, though should someone choose to emigrate bitcoin would be easier to handle.  It may also be easier to purchase large quantities of bitcoin vs. gold at the moment as it's quickly transferable from elsewhere around the globe while people with gold locally may be tempted to hold onto it.

That's exactly what you did, introducing "5 years" as if I was suggesting that one could predict the future cost.  That was clearly not what I was doing. "It will tell you how expensive it would be for an entity (outside or inside) to take over the network."


That is not the relevant question.  The relevant question is the cost per % of the total hashrate.  The cost of acquiring 51% today must be larger than the cost of acquiring 50% 2 years ago.


I think you meant "ad hominem" but Really?  "I don't think you or I are qualified to even enumerate all the possible attack vectors".  That's about the lightest form of ad hominem I've ever seen.  And you acknowledge that it's a true statement.  So despite not knowing all the possible attack vectors you have authoritatively stated that hashrate has little relevance to security.


If there was less hash power on the bitcoin network right now, say 1/100th of the power, all else the same, would bitcoin be more or less secure?  I don't see how you can dispute such a thing.


This is rich from someone claiming ad hominem and also claiming that hash rate has largely no relevance on security, and without qualifiers at that.


That's a big IF Johnny and it's the first time you're mentioning it.  If your argument rests on that being the critical component then I'm pretty sure you're on the wrong side of this one.  Also, as with ASICs, that high risk data point would only hold until the proliferation of those 1000x hashrate devices.  So while your hypothetical scenario may have identified a potential point in time where more hash power doesn't equal more security, at a cusp between technologies or when there is a monopoly at such a cusp, that single point does not map to the rest of the curve.  And again, it's a huge hypothetical.  Hypothetically no bitcoin miner would ever go rogue since they'd be jeopardizing their own business, so by that hypothetical we could just have one miner.  See how well those wild hypotheticals work?
I think you may be confusing "how relevant" with "perfectly correlated".  I've never suggested a perfect correlation just some correlation on some attack vectors while you in fact have suggested an unqualified approximate 0 correlation.  You're out on a limb.  
I agree, it's kinda pointless to go back and forth so how about we bring in an expert opinion as it is an important issue and I'd hate to be operating under a bad assumption.

From here:
"total hashrate is irreverent [irrelevant]." 
To here:
"The argument is not that there isnt a correlation between hashrate and security, its that the correlation is misleading."
I think you may mean "can be misleading" and I agree.
I'm starting to see more of your point than I had previously.  I agree with most of your thoughts.  I think our difference of opinion may be due to your apparent focus on a  sort of universal rule while I was being more literal about it in terms of actual history.  I also was focusing on the outside threat vs. for example the bad internal player threat.  I think it would be difficult to come to any sort of universal rule regarding either raw hashrate or decentralization alone (certainly with there being many possible attack vectors), which is consistent with my first post, that both together impact security.  I acknowledge that you can have a hashrate increase without adding overall security (one miner for example) and that you're better off with more decentralization of hashpower vs. less.  I hope you can acknowledge that similarly you can have more decentralization with less hashpower and be worse off security wise.  I think the difference in specific scenarios and contexts are obviously what dictate those outcomes, which is where the "can be misleading" part comes in.
I do think that you may to have come closer to acknowledging my side, while I have acknowledged that decentralization is important from the start.  I won't hold your face in it, but you were the one suggesting:
"Have you considered that you may have a poor understanding of the mechanics of how bitcoin is secured?"
I think it should be pretty clear that I have an ample understanding.
That said, I'm not too proud to admit that I learned something from this debate. I found our discussion challenging, interesting and enlightening.  Specifically I most appreciate your thoughts on the concept that hashing power can increase due to Moore's law while not having gained security, essentially by definition.  While that concept would not have been foreign to me logic wise, it wasn't something would have considered so clearly.  Btw, these are the reasons I will persist even if nobody else will likely follow a thread this deep.  I learn more via debate than I do from an echo chamber.  I truly hope your feel the same about our exchange.  Thanks.  I'll keep an eye out for your posts.

It seems you've now introduced a new term "relative hashrate" where before you were talking about "relative distribution".   Are you using those terms interchangeably?  If not then was the original poster you replied to talking about absolute hashrate or relative hashrate?  It seems as if since he was comparing it to 2 years ago that makes it relative.


I can't tell if this is a change in your position or not.  I'll have to reread the thread.   Also, the second part seems to contradict your statement on "relative hashrate".


It is not meaningless relating to security of the network from outside threats - the vector where an attacker has to acquire hashing power from 0.  This has been my point from the beginning.
In 2010 it would have been relatively easy for Amazon to turn a switch and take over the network using their own CPUs.  In 2015 it would require them to spend likely hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire the required hash power.  In this scenario the distribution of existing hash power (pre-attack) is hardly relevant, and the absolute hash power of the network is very relevant.
I'll do a self post in the next few days and tag Andreas in it.

Let's say Papouli needs his meds or just food beyond 60€, or perhaps he doesn't want to wait in line all day at an ATM that will be empty before he gets halfway to it, you could send him some BTC and he (or maybe your brother/sister/cousin) could start to educate people about it, refer them to the internet, to exchanges etc. to show it has worldwide value and exchangeability with other currencies.  This is how network effects get going.
That's what I'd be doing right now if I found my family in that situation. What else could you do?  I suppose barter but that's harder and has no independent approximate exchange rate.
I was also thinking that if I was an enterprising non-Greek local with access to Bitcoin and Euros, say a Slovenian or Italian, there may be a pretty good spread to be made trading bitcoin, EUR and goods.  I need to put more thought into it, but this seems like an opportunity for a win-win-win.  Grease (pardon the pun) the wheels of trade, get people goods they need, get EUR moving and introduce Bitcoin.

I think the fact that the bitttorent network is still going strong tells us much about how effective port blocking, DoSing and even prosecution would be.  Somewhat but not effective enough to keep people from using it.
When bitcoin becomes a threat you won't need banks as any other user could act as an exchange.
It's not invulnerable but that doesn't mean it's significantly vulnerable either.

Both are important.  However your original comment seems to suggest that raw hashing power is not important.

I'd like to thank you for this thread.  I've learned much from it.  I've been on the fence, and maybe still am, but I feel more comfortable that there is not really a crisis at the moment.  I think the discussion is fascinating and your points are very good IMO.
Also, I just wanted to introduce that one thing that perhaps most people are missing is that since bitcoin is open source, not controlled by any one entity, we really don't have a need to be so protective of it vs. other digital currencies.  What I mean is that should we even create a deficiency in it that it served by either a company, a sidechain or a "competing" digital currency, that's probably OK.  You did mention at least once that these can be complementary and I think that should be emphasized.  SMTP does not compete with TCP/IP or FTP, it leverages and/or enhances and/or complements it, just like any other protocol.  Bitcoin doesn't need to be all things to all people in order to be successful.  We should definitely weigh the risks before doing anything drastic.  I'd like to see more people make more proposals instead of essentially just talking about 3 scenarios (1: no change yet, 2: set change to X, 3: set change to Y with an increase of Z%/year).  I haven't seen much discussion about something more inline with the dynamic difficulty scheme for example.  I think the "no change yet" position you are advocating would be well served to be argued even more - this thread is a great start, as I think it more accurately reflects the likely position of those people that have been mostly categorized as "do nothing" or "opposed to change".  
Also, if we could change one variable, the block size, and keep all other traits and effects the same I don't think there would even be a debate.  I think the "not yet" crowd is simply saying let's take it slow.   I think that's the camp I'm leaning toward at the moment :).  That said, I think this debate is a great tool for people to advance their knowledge and understanding of this amazing and complex technology. 
Some have suggested that this debate is hurting bitcoin, but I think it may actually be the seeds of it's greatness and a sign of what is to come in terms of the of a decentralized system like this, run by the people with no official governors.  I find it all fascinating to watch and consider.

"Joshua Scigala, CEO of Vaultoro, later told Coindesk his site has seen traffic growth of more than 60% from Germany and Spain as well (which jibes with the idea that broad interest in bitcoin is growing across Europe and Central America)."
Could Fortune have forgotten than Spain is in fact in Europe?  What the hell does Central America have to do with Joshua's statement?  Also perhaps it's relevant that Spain is likely the next country to drop?  The argument they presented as a reason why it's not got to do with Greece seems to actually make the case that this spike does have to do with the Greek default as the two next most likely countries to be affected are Germany and Spain.

I'm talking about DOS transactions and dust transactions that someone would not likely want to pay for.  If there capacity is there and miners are likely to put through even free transactions (as the appear to be now) then these free transactions will likely clutter at least some of the block capacity at least some of the time.  
I'm trying to differentiate between "real" organic demand as in more people sending money, vs. artificial demand.

The arguments I've heard speak about equilibrium.  So if a Cypress event were to happen those folks would be highly motivated to crank up their fees.  I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  
The other theory is that should something like that happen it would be much easier to reach larger agreement.  The counter is that it could take a while to roll out the patch.  I've read both sides of that though.  Some say it could be done in days while others predict it would take months.  I tend to think its probably weeks, especially if it poses a serious business risk to the folks rolling out the fix.   I do see the benefit of trying it first with a conservative change just to ensure it can be done and to know the time required.  That said a 20x increase may be what folks are reacting to.  If the proposal was for an increase to 2 or 4MB and to shoot for 2 or 3 months from now I'm curious what the reaction would be.
I've mentioned this elsewhere but I'm also curious why there is no serious proposal for a dynamically adjusting block size along the lines of the difficulty.

I think you're missing the point.  The argument is not for a lower block size, it's to wait longer until the issue is more pressing as not to fracture the community/fork.  In theory as we get closer to there being a real problem it will be more universally accepted that an increase is required and/or there may be other developments like the Lightning Network or side chains that might offer other variables to consider.  In short I think it can be summed up as "don't be too hasty."

This made me think of something that might be important.  xPub/xPriv paper wallets (HD) rely on software to enumerate all the addresses and are I believe dependent on scanning *the* blockchain for transactions.  It seems like things could get muddied if for example your HD wallet provided chooses one chain over another.  I suppose one could manually enumerate the independent  private keys if necessary.  Also, I believe all coins from prior to the fork would be fine, but the complexity likely comes in when trying to spend them on a particular fork as you are to an extent dependent on the wallet software and their choice of fork/options.  
This brings up a different and interesting subject.  I wonder if wallet providers are thinking about adding support for more than one fork should it happen...

It doesn't fit your power specs but an antminer S5 still makes a few $ a day and cost about $400 to buy.  My guess is it will break even give or take on a daily basis in terms of electricity cost (depends on the price/kWh) but that you'll likely wind up in a hole in terms of the hardware cost.  Many variables though so could go either way.  If you live someplace cold, they will heat a room or two through the winter which can help cover costs.  You'll have to get used to the fan noise too.  If you are considering doing it in the name of decentralization as a donation I think you'll be looking the cost of the unit as the donation +/- $50-100.  Also, you'll need a PSU to power it so don't forget that in the cost of the system.

I'm obviously not commenting on the validity of the claims and just offering a possible explanation for it being a much smaller amount of money than most are extrapolating as that would be very hard to believe.
That said, to answer your question, if "he" thought he had $3,000 that might be tied to a dark web site under federal investigation via the ledger, combined with an altered state of mind, he might just "forget" about it and then have completely written it off when he heard bitcoin "died" as has been reported tens of times since then.

Good point. I was just clarifying that I don't think the point is smaller block sizes.  The testing was great and I'm actually surprised it took until now to uncover that.  What the testing also demonstrated is the complexity of the system and in a way it reinforces that nothing is necessarily a slam dunk.  The point being proceed with caution.  I'm really surprised more people aren't proposing dynamic block sizes that change with the difficulty or along the same lines as it.  Perhaps it could dynamically increase ahead of the mean current demand.  This could still create a situation where low fee transactions are delayed but potentially offers protection against spam/attacks immediately impacting the network requirements (bandwidth, storage etc.).
I wonder how much of the concern is that the proposal is to go from 1 to 20 (or 21) which is a 20x increase.  If it were instead suggested that we move to 2 or 4 and to adjust the algorithm to slide to allow bursts up to 2x (4x) the current mean, my bet is that less of the community would be concerned.  Another way to do it could be to set a schedule in advance so the community could plan on the maximums at any given date so they could plan accordingly.  So for example scale from 1 to 20MB by 2MB each month (every 4320 blocks?).

I agree that the compromised block size idea might be a better approach, though I'm no authority, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the concepts and views.  To your point I think the 20 fold increase may be what's scaring people.
I've heard it suggested that the roll-out could be done in days (I'd think weeks).  Perhaps that's something that someone who has more experience could comment on.  It certainly appears to be an important factor to consider.
I see the point of your analogy but it could also be said that worrying about it now and trying to reach consensus about it *might* be akin to stopping 100 yards before the intersection which might get you rear ended ;).  Speeding up prematurely could cause a similar outcome.  Sometimes you have to get to the intersection to be in the best situation to assess the situation.  It's clear to me though that nobody really knows yet.
I see this debate as very healthy and arguably (one of) the first of many like it to follow.  It's interesting to consider that this debate and dialog is essentially what we are indirectly proposing to replace/compete with the current system, the seemingly whimsical (or sinister) mandate and manipulation of a small group of elites that currently control our money supply and "perhaps" don't hold everyone's best interest over their own.

Rassah, great work and I'm looking forward to entropy and excited you've already integrated support.
Can you speak more about the pin reset feature? Not to sound bleak, and I don't know the details of the feature and do know you shouldn't keep any significant sum of bitcoin on a mobile, but I'm wondering if there might be unintended consequences of that feature.  The concept seems great as it gives someone time after losing their phone to restore from a backup and move their coins, but it seems to me something that might also provide incentive for people to "disappear" for the 7 day waiting period, if you know what I mean.
Again I don't know the details.  An alternative option that could be used to reset the pin is to have the user enter their 12 word passphrase again...  I suppose that removes the pin as a 2nd factor of authentication, but if someone's got your passphrase they've got your funds so I don't think it matters.  Just a thought.

Did you ever find a simple practical solution to this?  This seems more convenient than USB and more secure than Wi-fi or Bluetooth (unlike some have presented here).  [mentioned his electrum plugin, but I've read that electrum on android is hard to deal with as it required installing python (I could be wrong).  
It would be great for online shopping for example to just scan the retailer's QR with your phone, press a button to generate the txQR (or just hold the image for scanning by your offline wallet), scan it with your offline device have it generate the signed txQR, scan that with your android wallet and send. Seems like a lot of steps but I would think more convenient than USB.  Just a few more steps than normal and less transactions than creating extra low denomination paper wallets and much more secure.
I think this would be a great addition to mycelium's offerings.
I found a link to a project called "Armory Companion", but it requires running a python script on the cold storage machine and seems like it has many extra steps to work around the lack of the feature directly in armory.  
Any info would be appreciated.

I've been saying the same thing about Apple for years.  Consider this imaginary history.  Instead of Microsoft being guilty of anti-competitive practices via inclusion of a free piece of software (an internet browser), they instead decided to altogether not allow internet browsers at all?  Isn't that kind of like when Apple would not originally allow GPS Guidance software?  Also consider if Microsoft were to have said "the only allowed way to write software for Windows is using our Software tools.  Just think of that.   And, by the way, we have to approve all software for the platform.  Oh and that hardware you want to invent to interface with our ecosystem, we want a 25% vig.  Apple is and for recent history (since the iPhone) been not just worse than MS, but much worse.

I'm not sure where your "in perpetuity" concept came from.  I fail to see how it relates to my post.  Even with a traditional IPO you are voluntarily investing in stock that you'd likely voluntarily sell when you needed other things that offered you more utility than the stock.  My point as miles37 so eloquently responded but I'll more directly respond, is that we now have a system where the individual (conceivably all individuals with access to feature phones or greater) is free from his masters to work and be rewarded directly for his effort.  "In perpetuity" has little to do with it, except that you may also choose to actually save your accumulated net earnings (wealth) and may now have a safe vehicle to do that as well.

Excellent sentiments.
I would add that the other thing bitcoin has done for me and I hope others is to ask important questions like:
1. Why should anyone have visibility into what I do with the result of my own labor?
2. How have we arrived at this point where it is accepted and automatic that the prior is true for banks, credit cards etc.?
3. What is the potential of true global capitalism and how can/will it impact the future?
4. What other areas of our life are subject to the same unreasonable historically established and unquestioned assumptions?
There are obviously more questions along the same lines.
One other thing, I believe your new found excitement and optimism come as a result of realizing a few things:
1. The concept of true freedom is inspirational and hopeful.  If unleashed this could solve more of the world's problems than any "benevolence by force."
2. There are very smart people who are not only philosophizing about this potential but actively doing something about it.
I think all these points make a case for ensuring that our dreams of getting rich on bitcoin don't cloud us to the greater potential of the  possible end-game.  In my opinion, the real benefit of bitcoin and the blockchain is the impact it can have on human liberty and dignity and therefore on global production and productivity by unleashing all of us from our invisible yet very tangible chains.  We should not sacrifice the latter for the former.  Keeping bitcoin free and independent, and goals like true anonymity should not be abandoned for short term adoption and price gains.  We should not appease our master to gain a few more scraps for ourselves, we should overthrow him and gain true freedom for everyone.

I see what you mean.  I think my concern still stands though.  If you are making provisions for people not having backups (pretty bad choice on their part - certainly if they deposit coins), then it's also possible someone puts $10/20k on their mobile wallet.  Those familiar with mycelium's PIN reset could then *just* "bump them off" rather than having to coerce a password from them.  I admit this is a fringe case but if bitcoin were to pop in value and adoption this could be a more likely scenario.  I would think it would be better to avoid situations where this was an available attack vector.  Regarding the phone's database, are you suggesting the private key is in there unencrypted?  That would IMO be more of a concern as "grab and run" becomes an even easier attack vector.  In a strange way this could protect a user, but I think it would be better to have an encrypted database and not have the option for a pin reset without requiring some other secret information.
I've read other people suggest that a backup should be mandatory on setup.  I can imagine why you'd not want to force this on people that are just poking around, but it might help solve problems, including this one, albeit as rare a scenario as it might currently seem.
I hope none of this makes me out to be a critic, I just noticed what appeared to be a concern that might have unintended consequences.
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:41:52
I agree with your points.  Just a point of clarification from a prior [post]( of mine.
It's unfortunately not as simple as staying under a certain amount.  Banks have compliance officers that are currently used to look for some amorphous suspicious activities (sounds like Gestapo tactics) including multiple deposits that add up to larger amounts.  Also, whatever today's definition is, it could change to include other "suspicious" activities.
Also, we have to consider PRISM which in theory could give the government access to much more information than is suggested by your post.  They seem to consider themselves above the law.
Edit: to fix link.

His point still holds and answers your question regardless of the payment mechanism.  "I hate to break it to you but it isn't obvious to anybody why a merchant should give away an additional 4% of their revenue."  It is obvious and it happens all the time and BitttBurger has mentioned it many times "to garner new business".  Look into basic economics. Sometimes you sacrifice margin for volume.  Also customer acquisition is something many companies will invest in. Lose money in the short term to sign a customer that may return.  If Company A steals a customers from Company B because they offer a bitcoin payment option that is essentially free money they would have otherwise not made as long as the discount does not make the transaction unprofitable.  So this is why companies would and have done such a thing, not just with regard to bitcoin but with regard to promotions, customer acquisition, reduction of inventory etc.  Get it yet?
Edit: typo.

I'm not sure this is a secure short term "fix" or not but I'm posting it for feedback.  I did this on my ubuntu linux system which is unfortunately running 13.04, not a long term supported OS (long story):
cshs   &lt;= then enter a different shell, like "sh" for example (don't enter the quotes)
mv /bin/bash /bin/bash-vulnerable
Then I edited the /etc/passwd file to replace instances of /bin/bash with /bin/sh for other processes.  
sudo vi /etc/passwd
A reboot is likely in order, but I've already ssh'd in as another user and verified I was dropped into sh rather than bash.  I was also able to ssh in as myself, which I was not able to do when I originally just renamed bash without first issuing the chsh command.  I think ssh was failing since it couldn't find the user's specified shell.

Great project and nice work.  
I want to offer you some information regarding your "competition".  I've thought about doing something similar to what you appear to be working on, though have not for lack of time.  My approach was going to be to use an OpenWRT capable router, many available in the $20-30 price range, install OpenWRT and then to modify either WifiDog or ChilliSpot to accept bitcoin.  I think this would be a rather minor modification making this a relatively easy path to a stable and inexpensive bitcoin based captive portal Wi-Fi device.
Kudos to you for actually executing while I and others watch from the sidelines.  I would definitely contribute to crowdfunding your project if the device was priced under $100, the Access Point was strong and stable and the code solid.  
I just thought I'd bring you information about a potentially faster and easier path that someone could or perhaps is already taking toward similar ends in case one of your financing options is better suited to deal with competition.  It would be a shame to over-extend yourself just to have someone swipe your market out from underneath you with some quick mods to already stable and tested open source code.
By the way, I think the killer app here is if someone could integrate some self organizing meshing, and then include Tor by default.  I looked at the OLSR mesh project, but didn't get too deep into it.
Also, I think one potential competitor is OpenGarden with FireChat which is poised to make this happen and has an established user base already.
A self organizing mesh network with built in Tor and bitcoin micro-payments is definitely in our near future.  In the meantime any work in this space pushes the ball closer.
Edit: corrected the fact that FireChat is part of OpenGarden.

Now we're getting somewhere.  Thanks for the elaboration.  Can you describe in a bit more detail what you do for compliance?  Do you simply check against those lists?  Do you store the information about who bought what and when?  Is it automatically reported (like banking compliance is) or is it stored for later potential subpoena (like a precious metals dealer might be required to do)?  All of this information would be useful for potential customers, I'm not trying to grill you.  On the contrary I'm trying to help people better understand your service so they can weight the pros and cons of it against for example using localbitcoins - which frankly has a lot of cons, just not the same ones as having records kept about you.  
I don't think anyone would disagree with most of what you wrote in your post, but it does not change the fact that people should know what your reporting practices are.
Some people use bitcoin for it's pseudonymity as you must know, which makes the prospect of tying in an actual identity a deal breaker.  Other's like those that use circle or bitpay etc. obviously don't care.  IMO being explicitly clear will only help you.

You seem to be talking about buying $1,000,000 of bitcoin in a given "short amount of time" yet that's not really the issue.

I'll find out what bank she works for.  It's in the burbs so likely a medium sized one.
I was just surprised that she was tasked to look for suspicious activity instead of a government person being tasked to do it.  I suppose that makes it more "legit" as it's not the government doing it but instead using force to make private citizens do it.  It seems more like a law enforcement type of activity than something a company would/should be doing.  It also seems like something that should be done via search warrant rather than preemptive data collection.
I'm much more anti-central government than anti-bank, though it does seem like bitcoin will be disrupting banking likely for the better.
We seem to live in a pretty upside down world where what we accept is a little bit crazy.  One of the things about bitcoin that appeals to me is that it opens your eyes to these intrusions into our privacy as it offers an alternative.  Why should the government be involved in every transaction we make?  Seems a little pre-crime creepy to me.
Also, considering the government functions much like the mob, are they really saving us from illegal activities or just "legitimizing" those same activities and conditioning us into voluntary servitude?  I think crypto currencies will bring back truly free trade and privacy.  
 there are already many ccs trying to make transactions private for very justifiable reasons, for example hiding your suppliers and the details of your deals with them from your competitors.

Guy walks to bank, uses ATM.  ATM message: "Deposit not available yet"  Guy says "mother f.....", 
Repeat 2 more times.
Guy walks up the the bank, tries to open the door but it's closed.
"mother f...."
Guy at coffee/other shop with phone, presses send, see bitcoin logo, old school movie style email animation, bitcoin enters envelope and transfers, or star trek style transports, from phone to store tablet, shop keep thumbs up, guy walks out with his product.
Maybe he just bought coffees for his older, nice and gentle looking mom and dad and he slides the coffees to them and says "Mother, Father."
Perhaps it could be prefaced with the same sort of animation of him receiving bitcoin with a message "thanks for the ride to the airport!"... Something like that.  A payment from a friend for a service, or a somehow show a payment for an item he sold.  Likely should not be an in person transaction as cash would have worked equally well.  Upon receipt he folds up his computer and heads out to the coffee shop.  Need to make it clear the immediacy of the receipt and spend to contrast with clearing times.  Would be nice to express that it's on a night or weekend too.
I see a bunch of different versions of this, like they do themed commercials.  Another version he sells something and gets a check.  On a subsequent visit to the ATM it says "check cancelled", "mother f..."  
He attempts to buy/sell something in person, the other guy grabs the product/cash and he gets clubbed. MF
Guy get's jacked walking away from the ATM, MF
ATM violently spits out change, representing what's left after fees.  MF
Needs refinement, but basically touches on bank clearing times, crazy hours, reversibility, danger of holding cash - not that you couldn't get threatened into sending a coin... Just might be a funny edge to see different scenarios with the same catch phrase....

I think the article misses the mark a hair on the checks comment by Buffet, which is a ridiculous comment.  The value of bitcoin is not related to the value of a paper check.  It's a network to network comparison that should be drawn.  Also, obviously Dollars are also like the supposedly worthless checks as they are just paper if you disregard all else about them.  What makes a check valuable is the value of the network that accepts them.  
It seemed Buffet was nervous too if you notice his body language.  I couldn't tell if it was because he was outside his comfort zone simply regurgitating what a tech adviser had told him, or that he was nervous about the potential impact on his fortunes or if it was just bad acting attempting to reinforce his beholden status with statists.

1. I've always thought one of the biggest and simplest to describe was "secure international payments", though this concept is not limited to international obviously.  Let's say you wanted to buy a widget from China, you might be reluctant to use your credit card  as you feared the receiver would clone your card or use it for online orders.  Since with credit cards you have to disclose all of the private information to use it this can happen.  With bitcoin you never disclose the private key, only mathematical proof that you hold it.  This also means that you and vendors that accept bitcoin don't need to pay for the infrastructure required to manually fight the fraud that happens.  The CC companies must spend a ton preventing and tracking fraud.  This also means completely avoiding the scenario where you have a rejected transactions because it triggered the CC company fraud protection mechanisms.  This has happened to me many times and is sometimes quite a time waster to remedy sometimes requiring a call to the finance department of the vendor to ask them to re-run the charge.
2. Related to the first, cheap online commerce.  To manually accept bitcoin is practically instant (download wallet, send client your bitcoin address or QR code or post it on your site).  To automatically accept bitcoin I believe BitPay integration is very simple if your site already has shopping cart functionality.  And no fees.
3. No Chargebacks for vendors.  Good for vendors who routinely have to deal with buyers receiving goods while claiming they never did and so you are out the product and the money.  While no chargebacks might seem like a bad thing for buyers I believe it is kind of like the difference between ebay and Craig's list.  When you use Craig's list you know you don't have a feedback mechanism so you know "buyer beware" and act accordingly.
4. No prying eyes of the Banking Compliance officer.  If you'd rather not have another person thumbing through your deposits and withdrawals to report you to the IRS or other agency, you'd better not use a bank because that is exactly what they do.  This was news to me until recently.  See my post about this.
5. You information is not public and systematically revealed to third parties as it is with credit card companies who sell your purchase information to advertisers.
6. Your funds are not subject to confiscation by the government as they would be if they were held in a bank.
7. Helps enable emmigration.  While with the USD you are limited to taking $10,000 with you when you travel, there is no limit to the amount of bitcoin you can "bring with you."  With tightening border controls and regulations the US government is making it harder to do this.  With bitcoin, regular people can up and leave much more easily. 
8. "Police confiscation of money", google it, is not a problem with bitcoin.  With no probable cause and only with very expensive legal recourse police can confiscate your cash.
9. Multi-signature payments.  If you run a small company or even a medium sized one, this can be an important feature as it requires multiple keys to spend funds implying that all parties would be aware of all transactions.  There are third parties (can't remember the name right now) that have developed wallets that allow you to set thresholds, for example payments under .1 BTC don't require multi-sig but all higher payments do.  This seems like another big feature that can help fight one partner from defrauding another.
That seems like a pretty good list so far.

Excellent post.  Your observations are very insightful especially for your limited years.  I'm excited that bitcoin seems to be the catalyst that is igniting the spirit of individual liberty in so many people.
2 things:
1. "Most people" sell when they make a significant profit.  It's the only prudent thing to do.  Yes there are long term holders, but it will make you feel worse to consider it a loss of $12,000,000 when in all likelihood you would have at least tapered down much much sooner than at that top.  It's the nature of speculation and I've lost a lot on paper by locking in my profit, and a lot in reality thanks to not locking in my profit.  It's only natural.  Almost no one sells a the top except in their imagination in hindsight.  Consider when your £10 turned into £10,000, or £50,000.  You'd have been out, and to get back in you'd have had to spend that money to buy back in.  There's the catch 22 that only a time machine can solve.
2. I've written these words so many times but I believe them to be very important.  In the interest of truth and progress we need to direct our frustration at the right people.  IMO Corporate influence is not the source of the problem but a symptom.  The source of the problem is power and therefore influence for sale by our corrupt politicians and system.  We the people unfortunately elected these people and over generations allowed them to infringe on our rights and liberties and to grow their powers.  It's important for people to direct their angst against the right parties or we will never clean up this mess.  We must elect good people, proven uncorruptible representatives who demonstrate their understanding of our Constitution and one of the most important parts, that the Federal powers were designed to be very limited and that individual and states' rights are paramount.  They must prove at every stage that they have and will work to roll back the growth of government.  Perhaps bitcoin and/or related technologies will make this effort irrelevant (I'm hoping) but in the meantime we need to hack the powers back down to size to the extent possible.
There will always be someone trying to buy influence, whether its corporations or unions, trade groups or wealthy individuals etc..  The key is to limit what's for sale by limiting what we allow our representatives to do.  Limiting power limits corruption.  These are not new lessons we just keep having to learn them over and over, IMO since each generation only knows their starting point and few among them care to learn enough history to avoid repeating the cycles.
Thankfully we have technology on our side now, so perhaps it can help reverse the damage, put a stop to this cycle and fulfill the promise of liberty that our bold founding fathers so profoundly executed on at great peril.

Absolutely terrific stuff.  
Is there a place to learn about the security testing that has gone into the HD wallets feature and the underlying concepts?  I'm no cryptographer but the idea that all addresses come from a single seed intuitively concerns me that perhaps my root key could somehow have come from another key.  I may not be expressing this properly but hopefully you get the idea.  While regular private keys are inconvenient they are tested and simple.  I worry, probably irrationally, that there could be a master HD key waiting for the right moment to exploit all other keys...
Thanks in advance for any clarification or information you can provide.

Somewhere along the line you make a faulty assumption.  You present that a 10% discount means a "net loss".  That is an assumption you are making and not a fact.  Many companies, certainly online direct sellers can make more than 10% margin on sales.  In these cases making any number of EXTRA sales means MORE money, not less.  The only thing less is that it would be less than if someone hypothetically made the same purchases using an existing payment mechanism, which is completely besides the point of the OP's post. 
Get it yet?
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:05:27
I also just noticed that you used very careful wording in response to my quote about the transaction's overall profitability.  You replied: "...is in fact losing profitability".  Hmm, why would you not use the phrase "...losing money" or "not profitable"?  Because you know that transactions can still be profitable even with the a discount.
The fact that you used that phraseology indicates that you do understand, you just don't want to concede that your main argument is incorrect or at least needs to get dialed back, like your tone.
Yes the OP is suggesting vendors give up something, but they are getting something else in exchange, new customers, new orders they may not have received, and if their margins are &gt; 10% (or whatever discount they choose) they would still be making money on those sales making it a net positive, not a net loss as you seem to incessantly suggest.  
Bonus: they are also supporting bitcoin and if they believe in bitcoin they likely also believe that the more people use it the better off we all will be.

@_date: 2015-05-30 14:41:50
I'm not sure if this is correct or not, but doesn't this also mean that clients have to be a bit smarter?  For example won't a wallet need to either dynamically find the minimum fee that will ensure a transaction gets executed, or would have to allow a user to replace a prior transaction with one with a higher fee?  Perhaps some do this already but I don't think I've seen such a feature in Mycelium for example.
It also occurred to me that perhaps nodes (and miners?) would be opposed to a dynamic blocksize as an attack would then mean more bandwidth requirements.  So someone could make it more expensive for all nodes by shuffling satoshis around.  Am I looking at this incorrectly?  Perhaps it would mean more home hosted nodes rather than cloud hosted ones, though bandwidth costs vary by region so that may not always be possible. 1.33Mbps/s in the US likely doesn't put a dent in someone's 100Mbps or come near any cap, but elsewhere or in the cloud it may double someone's monthly cost.
I think this stress test was really valuable.  Thank you to all involved for helping to add information into the discussion.  I think we need more regular testing like this.  Does anyone know how much testing like this has been done on the testnet  and how relevant that is?

The representation in the parent post is a lie.
You could only have bought bitcoin for a higher price than right now **6 days in the past 8 years**.
6 years of returns as of February 8th for each year until today at $1,075 per bitcoin:
1 year return = 186.06%
2 year return = 380.98%
3 year return = 52.05%
4 year return = 4,753.27%
5 year return = 18,277.95%
6 year return = 119,344.44%
7 and 8 year returns are not measurable as it wasn't trading via public exchange.

I was referring to the "peaceful" leftists protesters who some are suggesting were an entirely different set of people than the rioters (I'm not buying that).  My point being that it doesn't matter (see parent post 3 above).  If the rioters didn't represent the "peaceful leftists" some of them should have at least got their actions on tape to help separate themselves from the violent and riotous ones.

I'm glad for that.  This is another indication that there is hope that even the newer generations can see the problems.  I've been impressed to see this over and over in this community, and am continually encouraged that this community (bitcoin supporters and innovators) seem to be actively fighting to restore liberty via decentralization of power.  It seems to almost happen automatically as people realize through bitcoin what could not have been realized with the system we currently have in which an individual has absolutely no financial privacy.  Our financial activity is stored and sold by credit card companies and is monitored by private citizens at banks in the name of "compliance" or can be demanded via the IRS who ironically "loses" their own important data to no detrimental effect (yet).  Until now, aside from cash and barter which is generally limited to in person trade, we've not had the opportunity to contemplate why the government needs to be informed when we exchange value with one another.  Bitcoin almost forces us to ask why.  Why should some centralized regulators know that one person mowed another person's lawn or helped them build a fence or website etc.?  It was an individual's voluntary labor and that individual could have instead napped or watched TV.  Why does working, adding value, have to be reported to someone for taxation?  When you think about it that way it seems almost insane.  It's also insane that there are government endorsed exceptions that can be doled out to buy votes, but that's a topic for another thread.
I also wanted to add that my research into this generational slippage over the years has pointed me firmly at the year 1913 (1911 technically but more so 1913).  In this year both the personal federal income tax was introduced and "coincidentally" The "Federal" Reserve.  1911 was the introduction of the federal corporate income tax.
Side note, the progressive (from inception which is also another interesting concept for another thread) income tax rates started at 1% (for every person, no poverty line exceptions) and topped out at 7% for the highest earning citizens.  In just 5 years (in 1918) the rates had grown to [6% to 77%]( and notice that the break from the top of the range for the 1% rate from 1913 at $20,000 income changed by 1918 so that same income then qualified you for the 20% bracket.  IMO this is an excellent, well documented and ominous demonstration of the repercussions of allowing the foot in the door to centralized power.
A few years back I heard something that stuck with me.  I think it was from Walter Williams.  Prior to 1913 a citizen's interaction with the federal government was essentially limited to their interactions with the post office.  We know the reality of our interactions with the federal government now.  How could the people of the adult generation that existed in the world prior to 1913 justify leaving next generations such a drastically changed country?   IMO, since then generations have been almost equally guilty of handing down less liberty to the next generation, but they only fell prey to the slow boiling frog scenario.  The adults in 1913 were plunged into boiling water but didn't jump out.  I blame them the most.
I know people have mixed feelings about Ayn Rand, but I think it's hard not to relate to this [speech](  I recently found [Mike Maloney]( and his videos really seem to do a great job, to the extent I understand these complex systems, of explaining them in simple terms with a level head.  He runs a precious metals business so he's got a potential alternative motivation but I find him, his ideas and most of all his clear articulation and presentation very compelling.  I think he's doing it for the right reason, that also happen to be inline with his beliefs (a concept echoed in the speech).
Finally, I've been trying to put my finger on what it is about bitcoin that is helping it to be this catalyst and I think I can finally express it adequately, though perhaps not quite perfectly.  I think bitcoin has opened our eyes again to true freedom.  This may sound dramatic but I think we are as a society (small but growing) glimpsing the same sort of things that John Adams saw a glimmer of and then used to open the eyes of the other founders.  They saw then and we see now a thin point of light on the horizon, the opportunity to break from the chains of the prior history of the human condition.  Back then it was a rich land physically and therefore strategically isolated from the King's power with a wealth of opportunity for free trade and expansion.  They had to be bold and take great risks to even contemplate crossing swords with the greatest military on the planet.  I think we are at that same sort of cusp.  We can almost taste the future repercussions of this empowerment.  We are asked like they were just via circumstance why a percentage of our wealth or trade is due to be paid to some distant power, and to contemplate the implications of "simply" ignoring that power.  It's not really simple, but the reward, just like then, may outweigh the risks.  I think what we are seeing is human beings returning to their modern enlightened state, again noticing then declaring our individual sovereignty and casting aside these archaic notions that we need to be ruled, monitored, managed, coerced, limited, taxed, jailed etc. by a government that our founders set up to serve the people not the other way around.
It is a very exciting time.  In this case the counter-pandora's box to the one opened in 1913 was opened in 2008 with Satoshi's manifesto.  Let's hope and better yet, continue to work hard to open others' eyes to the true freedom we've all seen that glimmer of.

This is enforcement of the rule of law, not demonization.  Don't commit crimes and you won't have a problem.  Seems like you're supporting criminals.  I tend to care more about the victims of their crimes.


Undocumented immigrants can avoid being painted this way if they'd follow the law.  It might help to come here legally in the first place.  Asking for sympathy when your first act on our soil is breaking our laws is not a good start.


Citations necessary.  I know people with landscaping businesses that either are barely making it by or already have moved on as they can't compete.  These are real jobs that should have been safe (at least until the robot drones are economically viable) and they are essentially all being performed by central and south American immigrants, likely largely illegal.


Why should it be easy?  It seems that ICE has had its hands tied for years, and while I don't know the ins and outs, it seems like sanctuary cities provide a shield for them.  In CA illegals are given drivers licenses and it's my understanding that is all one needs to vote.  Also voter ID laws are fought hard by the left as they must know those laws would stop significant illegal voting.  We need IDs to drive, to attend college, etc.  We should need it to vote as in many other countries.
  It's clear as day that she's implying that she's asking if the larger group "millenials, dreamers, undocumented citizens, and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country, are fearful of voting".  Now why would someone who is legal be fearful of voting.  Don't try to con me.  It's clear as day that they have scripted this perfectly to send a message "vote, don't worry we won't come to your home" while giving Obama plausible deniability via an alternate interpretation.  Contrary to your assertion he was legitimizing illegal votes.


Please justify this assertion.


Why are you asserting that Trump claims it's the feds job?  Sounds like a straw man argument.


Trump has repeatedly referred to the traditional role of States and how the feds have imposed on them.  See his discussions regarding schools and abortion for example.  All of his cabinet picks, outside of the military, are there to reduce federal power.  Did you hear Bannon at CPAC today?
"Deconstruction of the administrative state" means rolling back federal power.
Perhaps if you weren't so conflicted and preoccupied about immigration status you'd see that this administration is likely to be the most likely to actually reduce the size and reach of the federal government of any modern administration.

I agree with most of your 2nd paragraph but in my opinion you're again being too general in the 1st.  I'm admittedly not an expert, but I get the sense our trade deals cannot be all lumped into any single category.
I think we could see a new wave of on shore manufacturing leveraging next generation technology.  It won't completely replace decades old jobs as there has been quite a bit of progress in the last 30 years, but I think it could compound and expand. An example is Tesla's planned gigafactory.  New tech on shore producing batteries at huge volume for a new technological space (electric vehicles).
If you look at kickstarter and indiegogo from the perspective of new value being added you might be able to see the potential.  Yes most of the tech is currently being manufactured in Asia right now, but much is being designed here and the key is that it's a new generation of product than was even thought of before is being conceived of and designed and consumed.  It's likely tiny at the moment but it's just an indicator that the capitalistic drive to innovate and improve productivity (or in many cases just novelty) is still alive and well.  
If Trump can significantly reduce the overheads associated with on shore businesses, which he seems to be dedicated to, I think that will make a huge difference.  Right now it's not only cheaper to use off shore labor, it's also significantly less red tape!  As we reduce the red tape for on shore talent the value prop improves dramatically.

It's hard to say which is the case, but this guy does seem to have built quite a lot of buildings which is no small task in NYC/NJ area.

How about some positive things he's done back before the media was in slander mode?  Have you seen this?  
2. On his "2020 campaign rally", again you're just being negative.  He's reaching out to his supporters directly since the media is clearly trying to put the worst possible spin on everything.

I saw that talk years ago and understand your sentiment.  IMO Trump is different.  He was slandered and opposed by both of our major political parties and all the old guard.  He's already appointing anti-state/constitutionalists to major positions.  He's dialing back the escalation of confrontations.  He was against the Iraq war (don't believe the BS - research it, he was on Howard Stern's (shock jock) show and reluctantly said "I guess" when asked about Iraq - this is what the media reported as him "supporting the Iraq war").  
He's also talking about eliminating ISIS by collaborating with the Russians instead of pushing the not-so-secret proxy war with Russia over pipelines through Syria.


It's starting to look like that may have been the reality (still not sure) and people are awakening to it.  Our "leaders" have not represented us for decades and appear to have been representing globalist interests shuffling our people and troops around like pawns and killing hundreds of thousands in the process.  We "may" have a leader that does represent us now and he will be held to account if he turns out to be another shill.  Give him some time.

I think the OP and I were both thinking from the perspective of a direct global currency serving the world population, so the seeds of a global organization for trade, free of middlemen, while you were thinking more literally about a traditional IPO.  I somewhat see your point from that perspective, however even with traditional IPOs that same effect is true.  If you are in early you make more return on your investment, or lose it all due to high early risk. I'm not clear why you think it should be different with a share of a $400b company vs. the world economy.  If you think bitcoin favors the timid, maybe you should timidly invest a bunch now and you won't have to take that taxing risk later.
Regarding "taxes risk takers", I don't see it as it's got to be a positive step from our current system which is full of risk takers even in this increasingly hostile, lower margin environment with lots of middlemen taking their cut and inflation devaluing profits and cash reserves.

Their misguided coddling parents and leftists teachers will be mostly responsible for their failure.  Fortunately for the rest of us this is a self solving problem.  Those who can't cope with the realities of life have a way of weeding themselves out of relevance (as we are seeing now) and out of the gene pool.  The colleges and universities churning these losers out will eventually die of their own incompetence as their alumni and governmental funding gets shut down and they are forced to compete in the free market again.  Smart parents are starting to question the ROI of the education provided by these leftist havens.  These riotous protests, especially when allowed to continue by school administrators, are not going unnoticed.  I predict there will be major political and technological disruption in the coming decade. They will reap what they have been sewing.

I'm going to ask you some very specific questions.  If you don't answer them specifically I'm going to assume you are either deluded beyond reason or are a professional FUD spreader.


Have you actually read the roadmap or are just going on what you've seen posted on rbtc?


What part, specifically, is partial?  You are aware that SegWit is being tested on LTC and Lightning also being alpha tested, aren't you?




It seems you just want a hard fork.  Why?


SegWit: 1. fixes problems, 2. lays the groundwork for real scale AND 3. immediately boosts the transactions per second (the whole point of a block size increase).  All without a hard fork and associated risks and without forcing old nodes or wallets to upgrade, in other words with backward compatibility.  **It is compromise** except of course if you are not willing to consider it compromise unless it forces a hard fork and direct block size increase, which of course is the other side not compromising at all.
There is no compromising with that position.  If you disagree, be specific in your disagreement.  Otherwise you're just spreading your *feelings* around which is completely meaningless.
The "simple blocksize increase hard fork" is also, if you haven't noticed, the most primitive possible response to scaling Bitcoin's TPS.  You are comparing a well designed, well tested thoughtful TPS increase that's part of a broader solution for real scale and is endorsed by the large majority of developers and players (aside from miners that may have other motivations) to a primitive constant change that has not been effectively tested and is opposed by most of the community.  Also, minor variants of that same concept have been tried many times before and have all failed.

I'm not sure what country you live in but you're assuming a lot.  Not granting government control over industries does not imply you can't put your income towards whatever you wish.  You're also conflating federal and local government.  Trump appears to be trying to reduce federal government power over states and individuals which is wholly consistent with the vision of our founding fathers, the Constitution and our Bill of Rights.
I'm in agreement regarding the 3 letter agencies.  I don't think you have enough data on Trump to know what he's trying to do.  Some say some of the agencies are working against him, which I think would put him into your camp.  Though you seem to assume he's going to beef them up.
Regarding illegal (I notice you did not mention the legal status) immigrants, we have a right to control who enters our country and who benefits from our tax dollars.  Regarding inner-city crime, you seem to be suggesting that crime is not a problem for those that live there.  You obviously don't live in the south side of Chicago.

The CBO report is 10 years old.  It's hard to distill what it's suggesting the annual costs are but there are a ton of little millions and billions that certainly add up quickly.  This statement seems to indicate it's at least very significant:
"The estimates that CBO reviewed measured costs associated with providing services to unauthorized immigrants that ranged from a few mil-lion dollars in states with small unauthorized populations to tens of billions of dollars in California"
It's also based on data that is even older and based on census data that as some have suggested and rightly so are likely not reporting a large amount of illegal immigrants.  If I was here illegally I certainly wouldn't want to be counted.
You've made many classic conflations that Trump simply has not.  For example:


He never demonized immigrants.  He never speaks of "immigrants" outside the context of illegal immigration.  Do you suggest that illegal and legal immigrants should have the same rights as citizens that went through the proper channels?  There are also many stories about likely immigrant voter fraud.  Here is a very clearly scripted interview where Obama is obviously trying to answer her question to the positive (go vote - that makes you a citizen) while at the same time giving himself an out (as if he's answering only the legal citizens in a household with illegals): 
I'm interested in why you think police presence leads to disenfranchisement.  In NYC under Giuliani he really cranked up the police presence and hammered down crime.  NY is now like a different place now, more like a small town, certainly when you compare it to Chicago.
Check out the chart on the stats from 1994 to 2001, when Giuliani was mayor: 
See the steep decline?
I can understand why someone who is illegally in this country would dislike a greater police presence, but perhaps then they should take the legal route to citizenship.  Most other countries have strict immigration rules.  You are apparently suggesting we shouldn't or that we should leave the border open so we cannot effectively enforce those rules.
I look forward to how do you reconcile this with your comments, using reason.

I'm not sure where I stand because I have some concerns about the implications of the change while at the same time I see the limitations of the system if we do not make a change.  I do have an analogy and some other random thoughts that might help explain my concerns and perhaps those of others.  Preface, I don't think I'm qualified to predict how any of the future scenarios will play out as this is clearly a very complex system.  Bitcoin is a unique experiment so we can't draw completely or reliably on history to help us know for certain what the future would hold should any sort of change be introduced, or perhaps should nothing change (regarding this particular issue).  For those reasons I don't feel strongly about any scenario, but I do have a healthy fear about the future of Bitcoin since we seem to be coming to at least a philosophical fork in the road.
Here's my analogy: Presently in the medical realm there is so much change happening thanks to the convergence of computer-tech, bio-tech and nano-tech essentially bringing Moore's Law to the medical system that some people are choosing a sit and wait position if they are diagnosed with a condition.  The example I've heard of (I'm not giving medical advice here - I've just heard about this) is potentially cancerous colorectal polyps.  The theory is that you can act immediately or you can wait and see because they are slow to develop.  "Around the corner" there may be developments in either the accuracy of diagnostics or treatment such that your odds of survival or the costs (monetary, stress, etc.) such the normal risks of waiting, like the advance of the cancer, are counter balanced (in some people's opinions) by the benefits that "may" be right around the corner.  I won't got too much into the specifics, nor am I any sort of expert about it, I have just been intrigued by this concept since it's rather unique to our present.
What this analogy boils down to in a practical sense is a choice between risks of different types.  Risks of action and risks of inaction.  I think we are in the same situation with Bitcoin.
If we don't act, either the number of transactions that the "backbone" network supports is limited such that alone it cannot compete with the likes of the credit card companies.  Or perhaps fees would have to go up reducing the competitiveness of the network, for "backbone" transactions.  Benefit: the system is at least software-wise currently cohesive, it works and has been used to transfer billions (in USD) of wealth around the globe and is fulfilling at least part of it's mission to liberate people from the manipulated fiat systems and without the intervening and manipulative hand of (corrupt) "central regulators".
If we do act, we may solve the scalability and fee problem, though we risk fracturing the system (albeit this appears to be happening at least mentally now).  Unlike the do nothing scenario, we also may affect the network in ways we cannot yet predict.  For example if the costs of running nodes changes significantly due to bandwidth cost or decreased mining incentive.  We also may introduce other issues to the system, not unlike how surgery can introduce other complications like new vulnerabilities.  
The summary being (IMO) that the take no action route has known limitations but is currently "stable" and serves a significant and important purpose despite it's limitations.  Some of those limitations can be supplemented (off-chain transactions) while those supplemental systems introduce issues, they are likely not existential.  The take action route may solve the transaction limit problem and the need for increasing fees but introduces new variables, for example potentially eliminating the current fee model (I'm not 100% sure on this, but if the block could expand dynamically to any size then doesn't that eliminate the need for market driven fees?).  Also, by making this change and forcing a vote so the speak we are potentially forking the network which clearly proposes an existential risk to the system.  That said, both sides are acting, the first if only by inaction so I'm not leveling this at the folks suggesting we need the change.
Anyway, not trying to stir anything up or sound at all authoritative as I definitely am not qualified to predict where any of these paths will lead.  I do see the benefits of both and the concerns of both sides.  I think we may also need to consider that perhaps a 50/50 fork would be great for the system and/or inevitable.  Perhaps it might result in a bitcoin1.0 for the folks that are concerned about change and a bitcoin2.0 for folks that want to swap change :).  Though I think the cost might be great in terms of the faith of the general public and the uncertainty that would produce if that were to happen.  Perhaps that's what needs to happen as part of an evolution in this new unique space.?.?
I hope this helps the dialog, and in any case I hope we can respectfully discuss the pros and cons, risks and rewards, continue to test the system, innovate and experiment with new solutions and keep this community in tact and pushing forward powerfully into the future.

How controversial!
First and foremost I'm saying it's not free despite leftist convenient re-definition of "free" (free to me!)
I'm also saying people with kids should probably pay per kid rather than based on their home value.  This sub is all too familiar with gaming dynamics.  When school is funded by a per household charge (as ~~income~~ **property** taxes are) it encourages even more wealth redistribution from families that have arguably been more responsible to those that have been less and mutates yet another disincentive for those without the means to have kids.
Please come back with a classic liberal static economic assessment.  I love debating those.  "But what about the children!"

You don't seem to understand what "implemented" means.  You also seem to be blaming the plan for the failure to execute by the miners.


There was no commitment to them in the roadmap, just a mention that they are currently being studied.  What do you see as the problem with that? Please be specific.  Is there a proposal or implementation for IBLT that is being blocked?


It seems a bit disingenuous to block a critical technology step and then ask where we are going.  I presume the next step is Lightning so we can safely reach scale and add privacy and add more security to exchange activity.
Where I think we go is correcting for the FUD, getting closer to activation, which puts pressure on miners to consider the consequences of letting SegWit not activate, and then we reexamine the landscape then.  There are also 2nd layer solutions being tested that might not even need SegWit.  I don't think we need to activate SegWit or die, just that it makes no sense for people to claim we must hard fork, and that it must happen now.  I've not read a single reasonable argument for it.


Why?  And wouldn't it be more cautious to safely scale first, lay the groundwork for even more scale via 2nd layer solutions, see how the internet develops globally over the next few years and then revisit on-chain scaling if even required?


Wrong.  Security of the network is of primary importance.  If you wan't maximum network throughput use VISA.


Not when balanced against the drawbacks of a hard fork.  Potentially existential drawbacks.


I think your ego is clearly getting in the way of reason.
Final question.  If SegWit only addressed issues and didn't include a TPS increase, would you oppose it?

I think he had a healthy skepticism like we all probably should have considering the secrecy surrounding BO's academic records and his birth certificate: 


Nope.  Here's what you said: "Are these the same people he's been dedicated to for the past 70 years of his life?"  He doesn't have to be dedicated to people to help them by creating jobs (as he's clearly done over the course of his life).  That's how capitalism works - helping by creating things people want and in the process creating opportunity.  He also doesn't have to be dedicated to people to return power to them.  He just has to protect and defend the constitution.  His anti-state picks already seem to be indicating he's going to dial back federal meddling in citizens' rights and affairs.

How would Qualcomm have solved the payment part?  I'm not confident I understand their play but perhaps by putting a miner in the device it provides the device with income that can be used to pay other peers.  If you want to use the network you buy a device (or they send you one for free) and you contribute by paying the electric bill.  The device also may earn money to offset some of the electricity cost.  At .22w/GH that seems to be less than half of the w/GH of the Bitmain S4+.

The EPA and BLM (Bureau of Land Management) seem out of control.  This was an interesting and enlightening read: 


I don't subscribe to the need for extensive labor laws.  As long as people are not compelled (slave labor) it's just another voluntary trade.  With the information we now have at our fingertips, IMO, the risk of abuse is much lower than it may have been at one time.  The ad-hoc economy that seems to be popping up (Uber/Lyft/AirBnB/Private Amazon Delivery) seems to be another indicator that there will be many opportunities to essentially work for yourself.


I'm going to have to disagree with you there.  Have you ever dealt with medicaid, medicare or social security?  I think the answer is again with private industry not government.  Where I do agree is decoupling health insurance from employment.  I think a compelling argument can be made that private industry can provide catastrophic insurance (much less expensive than today's plans) and people can save and pay for their own health care or purchase a gap insurance.  I'd like to see how a less molested market affects the pricing of care and drugs.  
Preexisting conditions is the nut I think no one has been able to crack as the safety net eliminates the need for paying anything until you are diagnosed.  The state answer seems to be to force everyone to pay, even the young and healthy.  I disagree with the government compelling action like this. 
At a fundamental level I view government as mostly unnecessary in everyday affairs.  For those that feel uncomfortable at the thought I can relate the this best via analogy.  There are big differences between ebay and craigslist.  Both have differing control and feedback mechanisms yet both can be used safely by taking different types of precautions.  Users know the relative risks and consequences of craigslist (no reputation to rely on, potential shady characters, no refunds) and adapt to those risks for the opportunity and/or the savings.  Ebay may make people feel more secure, but you're paying for that security and it is by no means required, nor is it inherently unsafe to use craigslist, just requires different behavior.  The flaw in the analogy is that ebay's services are generally not priced ridiculously and they are held to a standard of profitability while the government has no such standard and waste and graft is everywhere.

I also think miners should provide addresses where supporters (on either side) can send their "fee".  These miners could prioritize these transactions over others.  Miners could even create relationships to reciprocate on the behalf of other miners so these transactions can get into a block in a more reasonable amount of time.  This would probably only work now for lower priority transactions.  It seems like another way to vote to support your preferred implementation.

I'm with you 90%.  I've recently suspected that the problem with Ron and Rand was that they were so based they couldn't survive in the mad world of politics, and could not overcome the media bias.  I've seen amazingly biased Fox coverage against Ron, which was a real eye opener to me.  "Trump" as in the caricature, in my opinion was necessary to overcome that corporate media machine and he slayed them seemingly effortlessly (and it continues).  Trump may be a foot in the door for the Paul-esque to follow, though they'll likely have to be a bit more bold than Ron and Rand were willing to be.
Where I disagree is the allusion to Trump being influenced by $40M property sales.  This is chump change in the grand scheme of things.  I think he has the ability to be indirectly leveraged via deep state influence but I don't think a few units in Trump properties are going to be enough to buy him off.
Also remember he lacked endorsements from the GOP old guard.  If he were just another  cog in the machine he'd have gotten their endorsement.  I think this is the closest we've been to a president for the people since Reagan.

I see your perspective.  Do you acknowledge that this is a new technology and it solves an important problem?  I think it's hard not to.
I'm not sure you or I or the fed have enough information to truly speak to user adoption.  It's not like counting facebook users.
I see incredible trading volume on BTC China.  How do you explain that, a handful of market manipulators?
Regarding retailers vs. consumers, there is a chicken and egg situation and thankfully one of them is happening first as is necessary for the other.  If there were no place to use bitcoin it would be that much less likely to grow adoption.
IMO bitcoin adoption will happen in bursts when fiat currencies fail as they regularly do, or as emigration controls tighten or as new and innovative services are created that offer real utility or economic benefits over current systems.
There simply is not enough data for you to try to predict the future of a new and disruptive technology like this.  Most people didn't see the point of email, or digital music (I had countless conversations in the 90s with people skeptical about mp3s).  Technology takes time to attain adoption.  Now it's irrefutable that the internet, email, digitization of more and more assets and tasks has greatly affected all of us for the positive and has boosted the economy.  Some of us see that potential before it happens, most don't.  Call us libertarians as if it's an insult, call us a cult as we geeks were called when we had the first BBSs, websites, pocket computers, cell phones etc., but that will not stop disruptive technology from disrupting.
"All metrics indicate the opposite" only if you ignore all the good news which is obviously what you do.
Let's say you are 100% correct about MK manipulating the market, how does that translate to this technology not having huge potential?  How does that explain the trend that started years before?
IMO, we saw a big run up because of what was happening in Cyprus, and because it was easy to download a wallet but harder to convert fiat to bitcoin, we saw the price climb faster than it should have, yes a bubble.  That does not invalidate the utility of this new technology and it does not mean it will not grow linearly or even eventually exponentially, just as the internet did.
I agree, we've got our free market.  Let's see who turns out to be right.  I hope you don't retreat to a new reddit account if things don't work out your way.  You seem to be a relatively new redditor but die hard buttcoiner so I wonder if you've done that already.

Why not send it now?  Then you can just buy back for $1k or so if you want to replace it.  When it's $5k it will still be the same 1 BTC.  Win-win.

Interesting points and perspective.  
Regarding central planning, I think it's a bit to early to expect that the protocol is ready to be decentralized. We already have other coins spawned from bitcoin's code so that is a form of decentralization.  If we want there to be multiple independent dev teams for Bitcoin they'll need to work more in concert (centralization?) as not to create incompatibilities between versions (again, like other coins).  So while I see the concern, I don't see what you can do about it except step back to the 10,000 foot view and realize that there is no way to avoid some form of collaboration (notice the "coll" as in "collusion") in order to not fork the network.
Regarding influencing miners, it's clear that the hoards of chicken littles have gotten the miners significantly rustled with scam-like tactics like classic false support claims and Janssens not removing miners show he says support Classic until they opt out. Originally it was asserted that Classic had 70% miner buy in, which was and is clearly BS.  Core needed to calm their nerves and likely better explain their concerns and plans.  Perhaps those even contain information that it would not be good for the public to know (just a hunch) - think 0-day exploits and lead times.  Some information is best not to advertise.  For example, if real progress on privacy would be better to discuss publicly later rather than sooner.
Just a few instances of the Opt-out scam:
I agree it's odd about the miners %s and the hash jump, though that could be organic if they are competing with each other to add hash power. I've also read people think it might be banks desperately trying to get in on "real" money before it's too late for them.  Seems like a way to get bitcoin without increasing the price and while making it harder on the "real" miners.  They build a position so they can game the market and/or pull the plug on their hash power to wreak havoc.  Who knows.

What kind of fee/Kb did you include?  If you have a high priority transaction you should double check your wallet's suggested fee against  and then pay at least what's required to get a 1 block confirm.
Edit: Sorry this was intended for obviously :).
@_date: 2016-01-25 06:43:40
I think so, but I'm no expert, just interpreting what I read.  I think that's the correct calculation for the best possible bandwidth improvement via this technique and that does not include the part that is used by new nodes.  I have also read that if miners were processing private transactions (21.co comes to mind, though again not sure) then those would have to be fetched too since the nodes didn't have them already, then again the nodes would only get those with the block anyway.
Also by 55% I mean the new bandwidth requirement is 55% of prior.

Respectfully, I didn't see any example you cited that needed the government's involvement.  Respectively, gas station cameras, credit card co's check IDs at point of sale (or use bitcoin which makes it unnecessary), retailers install RFIDs and cameras.  The government is not required at all for these cases, with the exception of perhaps prosecuting the theft after the fact, that there is no real dispute (from me) they should be involved in and that's not what's at issue here.
In the case of the OP, he was being asked for his identity likely for compliance with AML and KYC, which is not to protect the CC companies from fraud but primarily (IMO) to protect the government from tax "revenue" loss.
I'm sure you can come up with problems that the government was truly required to be involved in because of bad actors, but the list does not include the 3 examples you used.

Bitcoin's unique capacity to open people's eyes to the true nature of money and our forced relationships with banks and the government.  Holding and using bitcoin helps individuals to better understand what money is, a physical manifestation of value derived from labor or property used to facilitate voluntary trade with other individuals.  Bitcoin helps us all realize that trade is meant to be free as in free from monitoring by bank compliance officers, credit card companies and the IRS.  It's no one but our own business what we decide to do with our labor and it should therefore be no one but our own business who we trade with or what we buy.  It opens people's eyes to how far we've slipped from true freedom since the introduction of federal income taxes and the fed.  Bitcoin is a declaration of financial independence.

Condolences.  
Regarding your statement "all downward momentum is related to unbearable bad news", can you be more specific?  I've seen a ton of good news and hardly any bad news, much less "unbearable" bad news.  How about Dish taking bitcoin for $20/month IPTV?  Seems like a pretty big development to me.  MS, Dell, NewEgg, Overstock, ATM+s, declared legal, growing adoption, ETF in the works etc.  Some small time losses (even $500 million is a drop in the bucket compared to global banking fraud and crime) would hardly be characterized as "unbearable".
My guess is there will be a lot of great announcements coming out of CES too.
Also, you know what would suck worse than your bitcoin funded sabbatical from real life? Being an early adopter and missing the real pop.  I'm not saying one is guaranteed, but that would suck.  How about compromise like getting a job and cost averaging in with an affordable monthly buy?

Another way to look at it is that the bubble was premature.  Though it certainly was convenient to get people to notice bitcoin.  I think with the steady adoption we've seen on the part of retailers and retail b2b partners like paypal, quickbooks and other similar services abroad, with increasing investment and more institutional investments we are bound for growth.
You seem eager for this whole movement to die, which is both unlikely as this technology at the least has solved an important never before solved problem (byz gen), and hard to understand as this technology is liberating.  Removing a middle man is generally good for everyone except the middle man.
What's your angle?  Did you lose money on bitcoin?  Were you a buttcoiner from the early days and are too invested in your own opinion to see that a lot of amazing thing have happened since then?  Are you a paid shill of those that stand to lose something, or do you perhaps work in banking?  Are you heavily invested in shorting bitcoin?
It's clear from your comments that this is personal to you otherwise you wouldn't spend so much time here with all your negativity.

What's hilarious is that they must think miners are pretty stupid.  A miner will not look at this chart:  , with the consistency and stability of the core nodes, even if classic does surpass the core node count, and stake his multi-million dollar business on classic.  It's a total waste of time, shill money, and the community's focus.
This can be seen by the weak miner support (3.5% after 1 month).  It's clearly not happening.
The upside however is that it makes for more great dips to buy into, thanks again to the uninformed weak hands and minds.

"It struck me that despite their tremendous disparity in physical properties, they share the quality that they have a relatively fixed supply — which is why gold and bitcoin make lousy money."

"But because the Fed has been manging the supply of dollars — which hasn’t always been perfect — these bugs have been patched, which the Bitcoin protocol is still working through. Inflation (of the dollar) has been low and stable for the past 30 years; most people are happy." - Happy with [losing more than half it's value in that 30 years](

Citations would be great regarding BTC China.  I've checked out fiat leak too.  Is that fake data?
In 1989 almost nobody used email in their day to day life.  Now there is an address is on every business card.  A "low" number of existing users at some point in time doesn't imply failure.  I've looked and failed to find email adoption rate data but I have to assume it was slow and flat for many years until it exploded.
Do companies "hold" credit cards as in the plastic rectangular card in exchange for goods?  No, they accept on authority that they will be paid in fiat for the transaction performed via the plastic card.  Right now bitcoin is no different, though right now there are people that rarely touch fiat, get paid in bitcoin, buy directly with bitcoin or via gyft and similar services.  It's obscure now, but so were credit cards until people became more comfortable with them.  I know people who won't use credit cards online as crazy as that seems.
Bitcoin is not a website or a company, it cannot be compared the way you have.  Not that you have no point in making a parallel but it's not decisive.  While it trades like the stock of a small company, smaller newer stocks generally have more volatility than large established companies, it cannot even be compared to that as there is no P/L or dividends.  Stocks can't easily be used in a currency like way, nor can average individuals easily trade them without an exchange.  Bitcoin also suffers from regulatory limbo which likely most people and investors are very concerned about.  Time and technology will likely sort this out.
By the way, when you refer to Amazon and ebay etc. I think you starting from their internet IPOs.  People had to create those businesses first.  We are in the pre-IPO phase with bitcoin.
If bitcoin becomes relegated to the black market that might be bad, but it also might be good for it.  I couldn't predict that, there is a vibrant global black market economy that somehow survives despite being outside of the regulatory regime.  If it becomes accepted by regulators it would seem that would be good for it.
I think when currency collapses many people look for other forms of wealth storage.  Bitcoin is not all there yet.  Regarding your comment that people by food and shelter, most people with means have shelter already and there's only so much food you can buy and store.  People who have wealth to protect need to protect it some how, store it somewhere.  Some will use other currencies, some will use precious metals and some will eventually use bitcoin and other cryptos IMO.  Cryptos also have other benefit over all the other options as they are much harder to confiscate or inflate are easy to export and are global.  Nothing else in existence today has those same properties - there is the utility of bitcoin.
I understand your points and much of your perspective.  There is no guarantee bitcoin will succeed.  I personally think it will or if it doesn't another one will rise in it's place.  There are challenges for sure and adoption is the largest.  But in order for you to have such a cynical view it would seem you've got to have more skin in the game.  You ignore every positive development.  How is that healthy?  I've acknowledged some of your points, that's rational.  You've acknowledged very little and the little you did you seem to assume the worst.
Are you aware of the $10T global black market economy (system D)?  Can you not see the benefit and potential of a global system that allows global free trade free of regulation and intermediaries?  Can you not see the benefit of a system that would allow individuals to accumulate wealth and facilitate trade free of the hands and eyes of tyranny?  You don't have to be a libertarian to acknowledge that in many places on Earth today people live under tyranny or in conditions where they cannot accumulate anything of value.  Is M-Pesa going to fail too?
First, how is this not a good thing and second how can you deny that there is utility here that may overcome the current challenges?  I see the problems as mostly communication and presentation, the easier of the problems to solve.  If people were made more aware of this currently complex technology, or the complexity were pushed down (just like we no longer have to type MAIL TO: and remember everyone's email address when we send an email and can use our fingers instead of cursor keys) so that people don't need to understand the tech to use it, this is a slam dunk.  The problems I mentioned are being worked on now by (tens of?) thousands of very smart and motivated people backed by millions in VC money and of course a huge open source community that didn't exist in the same magnitude when the internet was developing. There is a lot more to bitcoin than speculation and if you don't see that you are the one that is out of touch with reality.
If you respond to one thing, explain to me how you can deny there is a market demand for what bitcoin has to offer.  It may not yet be perfectly matched nor have all the potential uses been identified or users been notified, but that will come with time IMO.  I look forward to your perspective.

I'm excited to see you consider entering this space.  I have 2c to add.
I think adding a computer makes the topology overly complicated.  It also forces you to have to reinvent the wheel.  There are already openwrt/ddwrt modules to do this using the existing and well established captive portal technique, like [here]( and [here]( 
I would suggest either starting with one of those projects, or developing your own firmware for a specific reference hardware derived from or at least utilizing some of the work already done by these existing projects.  This would significantly simplify development.  Also there are already large communities behind these custom firmware projects which I think can only be a benefit.  I've worked in this space and there is a lot too it.  Before login you need to allow certain types of traffic through, you may want to white list certain sites altogether (bitcoin.com for example and an exchange where someone could buy bitcoin), you need to track sessions by MAC address or IP, you may decide to isolate traffic, after authentication you have to open all ports for the new client.  There's a lot to this and these projects have already flushed out all the details.
Finally, many inexpensive commodity routers will run dd/openwrt.  Some of these are under $20 USD.  They obviously include WAN and multiple LAN ports, built in wireless and rock solid performance.  Trying to reproduce this with a Pi or some other commodity hardware is obviously possible but seems overly complicated when you have commodity specialized hardware that already does exactly what we need.
I can't imagine the benefit of that approach, though I'd like to hear your ideas/perspective.
I would definitely support a project along the lines what I've outlined.
Also, you should check out [B.A.T.M.A.N.](  To me, a bitcoin incented ad-hoc mesh is the holy grail of decentralized internet.  It takes this idea from paid internet gateway to another level: decentralized and unstoppable alternate internet.  This is the really exciting space IMO.
Either way good luck and I'll be following your efforts.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:49:31
I think what we are seeing is the somewhat unique trait bitcoin has to make people ask "why?"  I honestly think this may be one of the most powerful aspects of bitcoin.  During our daily lives we interact with banks and credit card companies but none of us likely read or completely understand the terms of their service, or the volumes of interesting applicable regulations behind the scenes that are unmentioned in their contracts.  Bitcoin forces people to think about what the true nature of their relationship with banks, credit card companies and the government is and makes apparent the differences between our assumed and actual relationships.
Some of the comments on here are dismissive of your concern, those people obviously already understood and accept the nature of those relationship.  I think they are absolutely technically correct and completely understand their perspectives.  
You and others chiming in, myself included, are uncomfortable with the terms of those relationships and have questions as to why it "has to be this way".  I think what we are really responding to is the reality that we are not free in our financial affairs.  Banks don't simply store our money and pay some interest to thank us, they monitor our transactions on behalf of the state.  They can deny us access to our money on the same basis.  They can freeze our accounts based on who we do business with.  Banks and credit card companies are under the regulation and jurisdiction of the state and therefore have to take steps to ensure that ensure they won't be in jeopardy of prosecution based on their customers' actions.  They also have a vested interest in slowing down the adoption of bitcoin but that's another story.
I think using bitcoin is like taking the red pill.  You can now see the reality of the situation.  Your money, simply a physical manifestation of your labor, is not really yours to save and spend as you please.  It's monitored as you make it, as you deposit it and as you spend it.  I think that concept is something people need to really do more thinking about.  Essentially, you are not free to transact your physical labor.  I don't think the state really has that right, but that's also another story going back to 1913.
You could sit on a couch and watch the tube and the state doesn't care, as a matter of fact you may actually be qualified to receive money from the state (cough, I mean other citizens who choose to be productive) in that case, but if you dare do something productive you better let them know about it or you could be persecuted, fined and/or jailed.
I hope more people come to the realization you just had and have the same reaction.  You could shut it down, bite the bullet and use an ATM, LocalBitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader.  You'll pay more of a premium (which sucks) but you may start the dominoes falling.  Thanks for posting your experiences.

Apparently you missed the part where we all don't agree.  Nothing straw-man about it.  When you start paying property taxes come back and tell us about how you love paying for your neighbors (living in a shack and assessed very low property tax) and sending their 5 kids to school for a fraction of the taxes you pay.
The problem with leftists is that they think everyone agrees with them.  That's also why the get so emotional when they lose as their reality bluntly meets actual reality.
I'm not sure where you got this crazy idea that investors in automation owe your would-be kids anything.  I've never heard of anything so preposterous.  Perhaps you should not get your world view from leftist professors who never worked in the real world.

First, I think this is a smart idea. 
Depending on the volume of orders you could use coinbase to send bitcoin to them via email using their send function.  I haven't used this myself but it may make them setup an account at coinbase which is not quite ideal, but you could also "invite" them and then you both get $10 in free bitcoin which seems like a bonus.
For higher volume you might be able to use their API to initiate the email process automatically, but I haven't dug into it so that functionality may not exist.  I also doubt there is an API for the $10 invite bonus process, but you never know until you look.
Alternatively you could write some code/pay someone to write code to create "paper wallets" and then automatically email them, or email a secure link back to them.  Then your customers could use many phone based wallets to simply sweep the funds to a new secure address that you don't know the private key to.
I did something similar for a friend using code from bitcoinpaperwallet.com to generate multiple paper wallets in one shot and to fund them using bitcoin rpc with json.  He used it to gift people small amounts of bitcoin IRL.  Integrating something like that with your order system/process shouldn't be too complicated.
I suppose you could also do something creative like get customers to provide a social media account and then use ChangeTip or ProTip to tip them their bitcoin.

If by "clogging up the network" you mean "clogging up the network for very low fee transactions" then yes.  But if you see beyond the "low fee" value prop (which could never scale on a censorship free decentralized blockchain) then that is not your first concern.  Big companies looking only for very low fees for small transactions will have to look elsewhere than on chain transactions.  For companies and individuals looking for a censorship free way to transact, and willing to pay a slight fee for that the network is very reliable.
You also might want to consider what increasing the blocksize would do in terms of "clogging up the network" under similar spam attacks.
Btw, looks like the Sybil attack just lost over 1000 "votes" in one fell swoop:  .  So much for the "added security" of those cloud hosted nodes.
Hang in there guys.  Classic will go the way of XT and we can all get on with the important purpose of Bitcoin, until the next FUD campaign that is.

I don't think that's what's happening.
I don't know why the same amount is being sent to the same address repeatedly but if you look at all the deposit transactions the most recent was 2015-08-31 and they are spread over many years.
It looks to me like it might be someone testing a time based service that settles to the chain at intervals, like every few minutes or tens of seconds.

You're doing a lot of work to miss the obvious.
The core count is cyclical.  It's been explained that perhaps people run them during they day on their notebooks at work, or perhaps some are in countries that charge different rates at different hours.  Nevertheless the cyclical core count continues unfettered for a long time.  So if ongoing they were being manipulated we'd see some multiple anomalies in that pattern yet we don't.
Here are the top 5 node versions and counts:
1	/Satoshi:0.11.2/	1719 (24.80%)
2	/Classic:0.11.2/	1457 (21.02%)
3	/Satoshi:0.12.0/	1414 (20.40%)
4	/Satoshi:0.11.0/	407 (5.87%)
5	/Satoshi:0.11.1/	257 (3.71%)
6	/Satoshi:0.10.2/	214 (3.09%)
You can clearly see that the new 0.12 release, about a week old already has 20%.  11.2 is only a few months old and has almost 25%.  The other .11.x combine are almost 10%.  When we get to the older clients the %s drop quickly as you can see.  If we were to totally discount those we'd still have 55% on recent Core code, more that twice classic, and just those versions account for 75% of the pre-classic core counts.  In other words roughly 75% of recent historical Core nodes are up and running on at the oldest a few months old version of core.
So while it is possible that someone is slowly trickling in new core nodes, it would have to be a small % or done so meticulously as not to break the historical pattern. I see only one such anomaly at the end of February, somewhat insignificant bump and nothing else like it.  Regarding Classic, it's plain to see that the majority are on a nice flat trajectory, barring the DOS (I don't agree with those using this tactic for the same reason I don't believe classic should be spinning up hosted nodes), like the borg, slowly but surely increasing the overall count.  You have to squint pretty hard not to see it that way.


If both sides got commitments, the numbers clearly show that the commitments to Classic are the agreements that they are breaking as 3% might as well be 0 and 97% might as well be 100.
Your other points about what would have happened if not for classic are interesting, but speak more to the benefit of classic bringing competition and therefore adding to the node count, which I'd probably had seen as positive if not for the fact that a large percentage of those are new and running in the cloud.  People have suggest that makes this fit the profile of being a [Sybil Attack](  It's also been noted that to get a vote one needs only respond with the appropriate agent property identifying as Classic and to not actually be a running node.  This speaks to the odds that long running nodes will be favored over recently spun up ones (timed with the vote).
I respect you trying to get your head around this, but I think you are working too hard to not see the obvious.  IMO classic will fail just like XT did.  I wish I could offer you more help but it seems like time is the only thing that will truly prove things to you.  I hope if/when it is more obvious you will look back on this discussion and at least consider that you may need to see things a bit more rationally.  I think well intentioned people like yourself are rarer than the simply uninformed, impatient or ignorant, but your inability to see the forest through the trees with your one good eye may be helping lead the blind folks behind you in the wrong direction.  I don't mean that as an insult, just a metaphor that we all have a responsibility to try to help newcomers, less experienced to see when they are being misled and mostly to not mislead them.  If I'm wrong, I promise I'll revisit this and apologize, try to reconcile my blindspot etc.  It's hard to see that being the case though when the numbers and charts make it pretty clear.
Also, I wouldn't care that much except that this little wannabe civil war has made for some recent headlines that are clearly not serving bitcoin well in the broader community.
Best of luck.

Good catch...  I've been using a network printer for so long I totally forgot about the USB port for direct printing.  I'm sure someone has a recommendation for one?
BTW, I just remembered that you shouldn't even need a printer to demo Entropy.  It should be able to be plugged into a PC's USB port and then the image could be pulled up from the USB drive.  Each time they plug it in the image should be updated.  I hope Rassah will at least be demoing that.  If not, I'd remain a little concerned.

Let's compare: 
"I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Raegan" 
It was the biggest Republican win of counties since Ronald Reagan
Fail to see the similarity?  Obama said he visited 57 states.  You're so fixated on Trump you want to hold him to every single letter.  People mispeak all the time.  Bottom line, he won and he won big and the Democrats at large lost even bigger.  Grow up and get over it.


Well, USA today for example admitted (indirectly) 19 attacks that they did not report on for example:
Scroll to the bottom and you'll see the 78 attacks the WH said were "unreported".  You'll notice that 19 of the 78 don't have referenced stories under them.  Also note the title of the article "Media covered **most** of 78..."  Most as in more than 50%.  That's spin.
Also: "The real point [as in the point Trump was trying to make : added] here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters later said to explain Trump's comments."
Regarding my point, the other way I interpreted what Trump said is that frequently clear terrorist attacks are first not reported as terrorist attacks even though they of course are.  Trump has been criticized at least 3 times, likely more, for calling these as attacks before the "official" outlets acknowledge it.  To my knowledge he has been correct every time.  These reports, especially in Europe, tend to do two other things.  1. Withhold the name of the attacker (always seems to be Islamic names) and 2. Try to hide or obfuscate the religious affiliation or refugee/migrant status of the attacker.


You're a very literal person.  My example was a high profile case where this suppression was clear and the crimes were heinous yet silenced (likely to the detriment of the community).  Have you bothered to search for yourself?  Let me get you started:


I already explained my perspective.  He's got a slanted media filter between him and the public so he's reaching out directly.  This serves multiple purposes.  1. to reaffirm that there are many people who support what he's doing, 2. To highlight the contrast between the media's cynical reporting and that sentiment of significant support, 3. To directly communicate to his base around the slant of corporate media.
Rather than try to cut this guy down on every single potential mispeak, a standard I'm guessing you didn't hold Obama to, perhaps you can respect the democratic election that happened and give him a few months to get the economy moving.  You may also consider, and here's a prediction for you that you can revisit in the future, that the old media is dying and is going to be replaced by the new media (social media, independent reporting) and in attempting to do their best to remain relevant, just like the leftists they support who overwhelmingly lost in November, they are thrashing.  I predict within 10 years the media landscape will look drastically different, equivalent to how the music, television and movie industries have been disrupted and for example we no longer see BlockBuster or TowerRecords stores and we have many independent film makers and shows to choose from.  IMO, you are falling victim to the propagandist actions of desperate institutions in their turbulent death throes.  Time will tell.   Perhaps in the meantime you should consider if you're being a useful idiot serving the elitist left and the corrupt corporate media in league with them.

I think this is an interesting quote and very fitting reference.  While bitcoin doesn't solve the "last mile" problem for Western Union, it does offer individuals a disruptive solution around the problem.  The "last mile" term that is referenced comes most recently from telecommunications solutions such as internet access which is increasingly being disrupted by technology.  The telecom "last mile" problem for example is being solved in countries without "traditional" wired infrastructure, with much less expensive wireless infrastructure, wireless being the disruptive technology.  Arguably in the future we may not need ISPs and their expensive on ramp service at all because we may be using hardware we already have to create a mesh network with other individuals.  We will also be sidestepping most of the "regulation" and therefore cost and monopoly favoring laws that were created to apply to traditional telecom "last mile" providers.
Bitcoin in the remittance scenario has great parallels to wireless in the telecom scenario.  So Thompson's recent statement would be equivalent to a telecom in 1990 saying that wireless does not solve any problems for their core business.  Well perhaps not as it's defined today, but we all know how that played out.  They were forced to adapt.  Thompson better see the parallel or his company is going to go the way of the buggy whip, which by the way at one point helped solve the transportation "last mile" problem prior to the automobile.

When you say "as long as the blocksize limit is adressed", can you clarify what you mean? 
I think it is pretty widely accepted that scalability needs to be addressed.  "Blocksize" in the context in which you've used it generally refers to an increase in the blocksize as the technique to achieve scalability.  This is not a widely agreed upon approach as is evidenced by the classic mined block  rate and indirectly by the gaming of the nodes.

You'd see the Core node count going down while the classic count was going up, not just an overall increase in Classic and the total count going up as well.  Look at the core node count and you'll see it's very stable.
Someone just posted [this]( which makes it even more clear than [here]( but even the latter is clear.
What's currently going on is like adding new "citizens" to the voting pool to influence the vote.  They don't represent the same vested interests as the one's that were "citizens" before the vote as they didn't care enough to run a node before, and I'm highly suspect that they won't stick around after the vote.  That's not what the vote was supposed to be about, though it's so transparent that it likely will not work.  Miners are smart enough to see the charts and see the same thing.
Also, using a spin up service offers a lot less value than actually running a node yourself.  100 nodes at Amazon, especially if being run via a single account, can be compromised much more easily than 10 run at home.
Finally, add to this that only 3.5% (and apparently declining) of the last 1000 blocks have been from Classic hash power and you also see that their original claims to have commitments to, was it 70%(?) of the hash power was nothing short of a scam.  Check out Olivier's twitter for some interactions with miners where he asks them to opt-out to remove them from the classic website rather than asking them to opt-in.

Have you thought of the dangers proposed by proving that a hard fork is possible in terms of regulation being forced on bitcoin?  As I understand it, the idea is to get to larger adoption and therefore more stakeholders before doing a hard fork.


I was under the impression that over those two years SegWit was completed, and hammered with testing.  Is that not your understanding?  Do you expect bitcoin to turn on a dime?  Have you not read Nick Szabo's [Money, blockchains, and social scalability]( which explains the important trade off we make to scale for security?

Thanks but I think you misread my question or at least my intent.  I was asking why Classic was mostly new nodes instead of old established nodes, as in the classic count includes a very small % of core converts but a larg % of new nodes, followed by xt converts and then unlimited converts.
The implication I'm making is that this is not slow steady "progress" but slow and steady attempted "vote influence" (and futile at that as the data shows).
Regarding the "failed experiment", the one development team is simply the most trusted development team and there appears to be tens of contributors so your characterization is highly inaccurate.  The fact that a group could simply clone the latest code, change a constant and copy and tweak some threshold logic and garner enough support to even make a dent in the node graph, and mine 3% of the blocks, having added nothing in the way of their own code or improvements, speaks to the lack of centralization of development.  
We see how even a dominant closed source operating system can be upset by competition (see MS vs. Linux) and in this case all the code is freely available for modification and the system is designed to be decentralized, so I don't think we need to worry much about the core devs except that they might get pissed off at all the slander and punch out.
Regarding mining, that is a problem, but only if miners were to risk their own livelihood.  I don't think Mike Hearn was trying to solve that problem either.  He could actually have made it worse by enabling longer block propagation times as could Gavin with his 20MB choice which apparently he has redacted and even has been questioned by his own guy, Toomim.

You don't compromise on "safe".  And clearly even the anti-core team can't agree on what is safe or not, so apparently even they realize there is a relationship between blocksize and "compromise" as in what might comprise the network (the only relevant "compromise" in this context).
Maybe NASA should use consider.it to determine the ideal material for their o-rings, or thickness for their insulators.  Just see what the people want and tell the engineers to "compromise".
Consensus requires a "majority".

You seem to be assuming on the one hand that there is a cost to a DoS attack but then saying there should be no limit to the block size.  You also say that deeming some transactions invalid is breaking fungibility but then your solution seems to be to allow dropping 0 fee transactions - "claiming some transactions are invalid", which by the way some people would be pretty pissed off about.  I can't reconcile those ideas as they seem to conflict with each another.
You seem to be just throwing what you consider intuitive ideas against the wall which is not prudent given the importance of bitcoin.  I think it's great that you are concerned about bitcoin, but perhaps cooler and wiser heads should prevail regarding the block size debate itself, and you should participate by asking questions and offering ideas rather that assuming you know the root of the problem and assuming you can easily come up with a solution.
I'm not trying to discourage you in general, just suggesting you might be oversimplifying the complexity of this particular issue.  By the way, you're introducing good ideas.  The 0 conf high traffic volume is a good idea for both the sender seeking low transaction fees to move coins and the receiver receiving time sensitive payments.  I think you should pursue those with your favorite wallet provider.
I for one am glad that the block size debate has occurred and that all parties are vocalizing their ideas and that the process is a slow one.  If there's one thing we should learn from the Fed it's that dynamic systems involving millions of actors should not be rashly manipulated.

I see the merit of what you wrote but perhaps the issue is that there is no consensus on the "system we want".  Perhaps some of the community simply wants it to be a way to transfer large amounts of wealth around, and it already does and has been doing that for quite some time.  That established use is potentially at risk with a "radical" (not sure if that's a correct characterization) change like this. 
Maybe that's another tack, to try to discuss what the expectations are.  I personally think it would be great if everyone used bitcoin, perhaps not directly but as the backbone for other services built on top of it, like TCP/IP.  But, I'm not clear at this point if using it to buy $5 items is a compelling enough use case that really offers a significant advantage over other methods.  
Enabling and supporting small transactions, which would be great btw, and yes it already does it now, comes with its own challenges like spam, which the 1MB block size was meant to "solve", albeit temporarily.
Perhaps side chains would present a way to do that in a decentralized way so it was still cheap but didn't clutter the "master" blockchain with unimportant transactions or potentially allow a spammer or enemy to hurt the network.
I'm aware that I may be coming off as a critic of the change but I assure you I'm not.  I just see the points of the opposition to the change, and in this case the risks are great.
I also see the merit of what wrote. Maybe another option is to double the limit as a first step to prove out the concept.  Clearly doubling the bandwidth (assuming that's the case) is less drastic than multiplying it by up to 20...
Again, I'm not advocating for any particular position, just trying to articulate what might be the concerns.  I don't think there is a clear risk free answer and I don't think there is consensus about what bitcoin is or represents.  I think that's why there appears to be division.  I think the dialog is very important and will ultimately make for a better system.   Let's keep it going and try to respect the fact that others may have different yet valid opinions.

I see why you are suspicious:
1. OP was using a new reddit address, 
2. They posted a partial public key with about $140 USD on it to a public forum, not as likely to be done by the real owner as there was a pretty high likelihood of it disappearing forever, and no skin in the game if it was a theft.
3. No follow up from OP despite the passage of time.
If any one of those 3 things were different I'd think you were being paranoid, but seems like a funny series of events.
I think you are right to be cautious.

Are you sure about BitID not supporting different keys?
Mine had the idea of multiple personas per site as well.  Also the possibility where appropriate of no registration.  Registration is the same process as login just the public key is stored instead of referenced.
I've got  a C# server implementation that I created.  Do you have one in C# yet?  Our methodologies might be close enough that it could be a good starting point.  That said this stuff is not rocket science.  It only took me a day to create the server implementation.

You could only have bought bitcoin for a higher price than right now **6 days in the past 8 years**.
6 years of returns as of 2/8 for each year until today at $1,075 per bitcoin:
1 year return = 186.06%
2 year return = 380.98%
3 year return = 52.05%
4 year return = 4,753.27%
5 year return = 18,277.95%
6 year return = 119,344.44%
7 and 8 year returns are not measurable as it wasn't trading via public exchange.

Can individuals voluntarily nominate themselves without approval of the other congress people?  Nope, and therein lies the main flaw in your proposal.  Others include the leveragability of humans, the fact that you can't tell what known people are colluding any better than you can tell what anonymous people are colluding.  And, the big miners aren't anonymous.

IMO the problem is that users typically ask for a feature, like "we need more transactions per second", and don't usually accompany it with a demand for a specific implementation - "do it by changing this constant".  Users are generally not qualified to make the call on the approach and should really leave that to the trusted devs to determine the best path.
As I understand it, scaling the transactions per second has been in the process of development for years as it is a very complex problem that users likely could not wrap their head around.  This is similar to how your grandma likely could not get her head around the intricacies of the way people are tracked by websites (cookies, super cookies, ad networks, analytics etc.) yet she could probably use a browser and probably understands that privacy is important.  "I want a way to maintain my privacy" is a user request for a feature, not "I want chrome to eliminate the use of cookies."  See the issue?
"they don't seem to be listening" is something you may want to do more research into before you spread that sentiment.  They are clearly working on scaling on multiple fronts that will likely give us features that the average person cannot imagine right now.  They are only pushing back on a specific implementation that they disagree with.  They apparently are also looking for efficiencies.  As has been stated on this thread many times, SegWit adds other features and solves long standing problems while also addressing the near term transactions limit issue which can buy enough time for bigger and better solutions like LN to be bolted on which will give bitcoin the best of both worlds, security and a high number of transactions per second.
If people want it done faster, perhaps the classic crew could collaborate and pick off sections of code to contribute rather than proposing a drastically different approach, that the established experts deem dangerous, and forcing it on the system via political means.

I want to follow up on this.  I'm really impressed with this subreddit so I know most of you have probably extrapolated the implications of my comment, but here is some further thought on it.
It is nothing short of sad that our current system (in the US and others that have followed suit (for better in the case of seeking liberty) and then for worse (in the form of taking it away via income taxation, dropping the gold standard etc.) - nested parends, can you tell my line of work?) essentially rewards idle existence and taxes progress, production and voluntary trade.
That system is being fundamentally disrupted by bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.  Whether bitcoin specifically succeeds or fails, crypto-currency in general will succeed as it's a push for freedom and it's essentially got the force of billions of people who want to be free behind it.  It will just take time for those people to realize it's implications on their lives.
Imagine what our current economy would look like if the collective labor and minds of those people were truly unleashed.  If billions of minds were free to follow their passion, take a risk on their ideas or at the least do some mundane job out of necessity but without the weight of carrying the burden of the current non-producing members of society (I'm not talking the disabled or unable, I'm talking about the layers of fat - any person that derives their earnings from leeching off the production of others - lawyers, lobbyists, bankers, police operating under quotas, many government employees etc.).  I expect many of even the current non-producers would be emboldened (in a positive way) by the extra margins available vs. in our system today to join the producers.  Everyone gains, even those not directly involved as an expanding economy lifts people via an expanding job market with more opportunity and choice and by having access to the benefits of the progress produced by the others.
Like many politically aware people I've had a negative outlook for years, focusing in on the changes that started in 1913 and having a natural end in a police state with where we obedient servants slowly submit over generations finding creative ways to rationalize the surrender of our rights.  Bitcoin has made me do a complete 180.  I see freedom's force all around me in the form of the manifesto, the community, the momentum, the active advocates for liberty, the ideas (OpenBazaar being the height in my mind so far).  This is not some coincidental technological breakthrough.  This is a manifestation of the force of and passion for freedom that exists in all of us.  I'm convinced it cannot be stopped.  
Even the side of the community pushing for legislation aka. the status quo are unwittingly (or perhaps wittingly) helping to that end, as once we have adoption and people are using and comfortable with these technologies we can just change them, or fork them, add true anonymity for example.  Let the state think it has it's audit trail, then eliminate it via some code and a checkbox.  This also forces the battle and true nature of their control into the open so that the generations that have just blindly accepted it can now see it in all it's glory, completely naked and exposed, and decide how they feel about the state having power over the choices they make in their private lives. 
Please continue to inspire one another and to ask "why?"  To talk with people who have not yet been enlightened to the implications.  Also have confidence that this is the first experiment and first battle, and while it could be lost, the war will be won.  Freedom is too powerful a force to contain.  People have survived in captivity under brutal conditions based only on the power of what the future might hold for them.
We are living in an exciting time.  Consider the billions of minds coming online in the next decade being able to offer their ideas to the world directly with no middle men.  The future is very bright and we have some very smart and motivated people to thank for it, and ourselves for being the early enlightened.

Yes. that one.  From the roadmap: "Despite these considerable complications, with sufficient precautions, none of them is fatal to a hard fork, and we do expect to make hard forks in the future."
You're not fooling anyone so you should probably just stop.  You're just wrong and anyone reading the thread can see it.  What u/pb1x wrote is true.  Realize your cognitive dissonance, then why you have it (likely propaganda from rtbc) and get on the right side.


And your position based on an apparent lack of information, and perhaps denial, is part of the reason the only tested scaling solution, which also contains other important updates to help the next level scaling solution, has not been activated.
Or just go with the guys who apparently think testing and code review are not that important.  The third team to propose hard forks and in good company, starting with an immediate bump to 8MB (along with an unadvertised TOR blacklist) proposed by the rage quitter who trashed the entire project on his way out as he signed with a team competing with bitcoin, then the second team with apparently limited coding skills who did some testing to show that anything above 4MB was not safe and thought consensus should be reached via their home grown web survey tool, and now the latest team whose git activity consists mostly of renamed variables and commits from core.
The truth is right before you but you refuse to see it.

Mine came with attached reasoning.  Yours was simply a declaration.


You found out about the limit by reading the source?  I think the 170,000+ subscribers here likely mostly found out from the amazing amount of coverage it's gotten over the past year.  Anyone else who speculated on bitcoin without knowing or presuming there might be technical challenges ahead were taking a risk.  If you are concerned you can just cash out now as we are well above zero right now and I don't think most people blame the current price, if you can even consider it low, on failure to scale.
The internet was supposedly going to run out of IP addresses leading to some inconvenience but I don't remember Microsoft or AOL blasting that limitation on their product packaging or splash screens.  


Sounds like you think you're an expert.  So hosting web apps seems comparable to scaling a P2P network worth 5+ billion USD, the first of it's kind mind you, backed by millions of people with different financial interests and opportunities for gaming or perhaps even all out attack by nation states?  I think you should acknowledge you're a bit out of your wheel house.  Or just tell us what magic number to replace the 1048576 with to magically solve all bitcoin's scalability issues.  It's probably that simple.

Have patience young Padawan.  All new products and ideas take time to proliferate.  Nothing happens overnight, certainly not a new form of trade.
I suggest you step back from your obviously strong beliefs for a moment and ask yourself what milestone would make you question the strength of those beliefs.  There have been a number of pretty amazing indicators that this technology is not a flash in the pan, but my guess is that you can't see them through your investment in the religion of buttcoin.  Yes, similar things can be said for this community, but while bitcoin has been seeing slow and steady progress and interest the buttcoiners fail to acknowledge that anything is happening.  Which community is more blindly faithful?  
How did your gut feel when you heard Dell was accepting bitcoin?  How about Microsoft?  $75M to Coinbase?  Did you get butterflies?  Those are physiological signals trying to tell you that perhaps you are on the wrong side of history.
Bitcoin could fail, as many here will openly admit, but it's not going to fail because it's a ponzi scheme or because it doesn't yet compete on scale with entrenched systems, or because MasterCard or the Federal Reserve say so.  It's come a hell of a long way in a relatively short time.  It's got technology and ideology behind it, and the way I see it the potential to unleash the power of the unbridled ambition of human beings everywhere.
What has buttcoin accomplished, an archive of naysaying camaraderie?  Seems like a waste of time.  All the best though, time will tell.

Without the apparently fruitless point for point, it seems your contention is there's no reason to believe Trump will do as he said and return power to the people.  My general point has been he might (remains to be seen).  Most indicators of his actual yet brief time in office is that he will.  
If you want to rest on a few instances over the course of 4 decades of his life that's fine.  I'm looking at the entirety and so far it's looking pretty good.  He's exceeding expectations.
Back to the main point, my original comment, if you re-read it and not look to just take some shallow pot shot (as you originally did) you'll see that I was on point and not at all authoritative about it. "Remains to be seen".

It's complicated.  I don't think I could do it justice and if you are truly interested I think you'll get value from the long winded explanation.  Frankly I think much of the contention has to do with people having short attention spans.  This software is incredibly complex when you consider all the different inside and outside interests and the present and future stakes.  Yes there are other cryptos that can take bitcoin's place but if bitcoin fails it would be a huge setback for digital currencies in general.  IMO it would be better if bitcoin were overcome competitively rather than due to failure.  I mention failure as that is what I think the core developers are worried about which is why they are choosing slow predictable incremental improvement and preferably soft forks rather than a quick and dirty (albeit code-wise  simple) hard fork.  That's kind of a tl;dr, but I really think you should read the post and watch the episode.  Don't just trust some random person on the net :).

Your issue seems to be that you want to define what bitcoin isn't, and to deny others may differ in any way with you about what Bitcoin is.
To boot, you won't even express your definition, which makes it very hard for anyone to explain why their definition is different.

"Greek banks to record clients changing 500€ notes"
"Real crypto-anarchy"

How about the food you eat?  The car you drive, sorry, your mom drives, or your bicycle?  Every product in your home is a creation of capitalism, cooperation and competition.
Now why would someone produce an iPhone for example?  Because the government mandated it?  No, that doesn't work.  Because people need to feed their family and save for their retirement so they work hard, save money, invest in ideas and themselves and invent useful tools that others will spend their hard earned money on.  Voluntary trade runs this country and most of the world.  Speaking negatively about free markets just shows how truly ignorant you are.
Grow up little man.

After skimming this (too sleepy atm to read the whole thing), a light bulb went off that probably should have gone off a long time ago.  "Free trade" is a term that for some strange reason is associated almost solely with international trade, as in reducing tariffs a la NAFTA etc.  We need to shift the meaning of "free trade" so that it more commonly refers to person to person trade, the way it's used in this article, free exchange of human effort, property etc. without interference from government.
I'm going to hit the hay, but I'll read the whole thing tomorrow.  Just wanted to get this out there.  More people need to start thinking this way.  We live in an exciting time.  I truly think this pandora's box has been opened thanks to bitcoin and we need to seize the moment to start opening people's eyes to their voluntary enslavement and slipping rights via centralized power.  The more I read, and the more I see the changes happening around us in this space, the more enthusiastic I become that this strange world we live in will soon be changing for the better.

Also in light of recent events it might be smart to remember the reported TOR endpoint filtering that I remember people saying Mike had "snuck" into XT and the way he framed it.
Perhaps he was a Trojan horse for the banks/regulators for longer than many might think.  When he couldn't get bitcoin to be the system he wanted/needed he quit, slandered it and punched it in the face on the way out the door.
I think all of this sheds light on why caution is more important than quick action.
I think R3 also helps to explain why he'd leave bitcoin in such a way.  Clearly there is money to be made catering to banks.  What I'm trying to say here is that Mike is looking like a sell-out.

Did I miss in the manifesto where it spoke about coffee?  That seems a bit trivial when you consider the Genesis block quote:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."
Bitcoin is about a "cash" free of government intervention and manipulation.  It's open source so no central group (including the core dev team) can control it.  That is unless we allow it to be centralized into a few nodes running in data centers where it can be regulated into the newest version of Paypal.  Or if we prove that a contentious hard fork is possible, which will likely lead to regulation being mandated into the code run by known regulated entities, like Coinbase for example.
Sidebar: More risky, government regulators or the team that has been faithfully maintaining beta code at a global scale for years?
Why is bitcoin "failing" right now?  Is it some low fee increases because of spam and low blocks size, or is it hysterical and impatient speculators (and perhaps altcoin pump and dumpers) whipping people into a frenzy which makes for "good news"?  "Look even the media agrees!"
If blocks were truly free then we should all be in favor of those coffee transactions, but unfortunately while bitcoin has to the extent currently possible cracked the centralization problem, it has not yet cracked the means to distribute all that data for free since neither electricity nor bandwidth is free.  Regarding bandwidth, in some places it is not only not free, it's expensive or capped.
If we asked Visa to host 10 massive distributed nodes to support a Visa scale coffee payment network do you think it would still be the "Bitcoin" that the manifesto defined?
Btw, you apparently also missed the original intent of the tweet:

The flaw with your argument on  is that you're trying to portray the debit card as the solution when it's just part of it.  Bitcoin as a system has much more to offer.  For example deflation.  I can make regular deposits from pay checks into bitcoin and have my "savings" retain value (as it not lose it with inflation) and spend at will anywhere.  
On  it's hard to concede that the utility of being able to spend bitcoin essentially anywhere is not worth a 1% fee.  You also don't need to use these solutions.  They are options.  If someone will accept bitcoin directly then great, if not, you have the option to still use bitcoin but via the card with a small fee, notably significantly less than making a withdraw at a out of network or private ATM (for many banks).  I think the fees at these ATMs  call it a "convenience" fee, and for a reason.  Same principle.

I'm not a core developer but there does seem to be a process to make proposals, starting with bitcointalk and the bitcoin mailing list, including the BIP process etc.  Coming out of that open process one would know if their technical solution/suggestion was controversial or not.
I think you may be speaking from a non-developer perspective, which doesn't really apply to what I originally replied to.
FYI, Core seems to be objecting to the blocksize increase for many reasons, not just for the size  So they'd likely also oppose a 1.1MB blocksize.  One reason I've heard is that they fear it would be the go-to "solution" once proven instead of forcing people (like companies making money off bitcoin) to pony up and invest in a real solution, not just a stop-gap.  I'm not claiming I know the correct answer as it may be unknowable at this point (like being able to predict a stock price 10 years out - many variables and human behaviors involved) but what I've seen from XT and Classic has not impressed me.  It looks like a disorganized gang of amateurs.  First proposing a 20x max blocksize increase (as of 1/16/2016 oh and also with free Tor blacklisting!) and suggesting it was safe, then compromising to just 8x the current limit, and then Toomim (who apparently thinks it's cool to have meetings with Core while high) claims that even 4MB may or may not be safe.  
Btw, on their website, Toomim was originally listed as a developer, then some sort of consultant, and now he's not even on there anymore.  If the amount of scrutiny that is put on core was applied to classic this debate would be over (I think it is anyway).
In my mind there is no comparison between the team of independent developers (of whom only a few work for Blockstream) that have been maintaining and improving the code for years, and a new team that has repeatedly failed, not contributed much except a constant change, and seems very unprofessional.  Let's not forget the angry child-like rage-quit of the former leader - who now works for the banks, and clearly tried to trash Bitcoin for his own benefit on his new endeavor.
I don't think this is very complicated, and apparently most others don't too as they can't seem to onboard more than a few % of the hashpower.
Oh, let's also not forget that classic supporters are openly using a Sybil attack to sway the node vote.

This seems to present a conflict that it would be interesting to get Ver to weigh in on.  Privacy and government control seem antithetical to one another.  If he truly wants to achieve the global vision of Satoshi, he should probably be on the side of privacy.
As for the miners, it seems like we should try to tip that balance to the extent possible by mining at a short term loss.  To date it seems like it has still netted positive returns (just not as much as if you just bought bitcoin instead).  Locally grown food always seems to taste a bit better :).

You're great at sweeping generalizations.  What are you basing this on?  Please provide some sort of reference as most of what I do and have done for the last 20 years on the internet doesn't require millisecond latency.  Some of it does, like Netflix for example.




I think we should consider implications on bandwidth before increasing the block size further as if it's a simple and complete solution with no negative side effects which it apparently is not.  I think other solutions should be sought that don't impact the bandwidth requirements as much.  Does this mean no bandwidth increase should be entertained?  No.  Many variables have to be weighed.  Lo and behold all of these opinions are in line with what the development community is doing, and they too are largely ignoring the hoards of alarmist redittors.

I've read it many times.
Gold is a peer to peer non-electronic cash system.  There are a great many similarities.  Also, Bitcoin doesn't have to be exactly the same as gold for the same premises to apply to your invalid argument.  
Gold has value despite being inconvenient and slow to move in many ways.  How can that be?  Bitcoin and gold currently have overlap in utility as a store of value, though only time will tell whether they will diverge in that respect.  They also share limited supply, which is a deliberate analog to gold.  From the white paper:


The whitepaper also speaks to Privacy which indicates Satoshi considered that important too, and that is another parallel to gold transactions.
Szabo's [Bitgold]( was a predecessor and perhaps influenced Bitcoin and was obviously making the connection to the need for a digital gold, but not so much a Paypal2.0.


So supply again highlighted as the most important feature.
It's also been said many times before but begs repeating and I've never seen it otherwise argued, that the other primary value proposition centers around censorship resistance, just as with cash and gold (as opposed to other forms of value transfer - namely the high volume highly regulated ones).  
So controlled supply and therefore controlled inflation, censorship resistance and privacy and yet no mention of speed or volume of transactions.
I also wonder how Bitcoin became so popular while not having a plan for scaling.  To suggest it will fail because it would be "useless" is to not recognize those 3 primary value props that are also direct parallels to gold.  
X will be useless (despite other main and significant value props) because X is too popular also seems like some pretty bad logic.

Erik, wouldn't the name potentially switching be problematic?  If I hold "Bitcoin" one day with addresses/keys that are on fork A (during say the contentious period) and then say at some point the hashing power switches (a possibility that seems to be discussed quite frequently) and it's deemed that the fork B is the "long term" winner, I would have "Bitcoin" that does not exist on the "Bitcoin" fork.

It's funny.  I'm wondering if switching the dialog to privacy vs. trackability (blacklists etc.) could be an interesting way to re-frame the arguments.  I'm wondering how large miners consider the issue of privacy (since they are the ones holding up SW).
On a similar note, I'm wondering if there is a way to reintroduce a small miner again that could upset the balance of the big miners, even if they were to be "run at a loss".  I quote that as it seems you'd be hard pressed to find a time where mining actually ran a loss when viewed on the long term.  Yes it's mostly been a short term loss for individual miners who could have just bought more bitcoin than their electricity costs produced, but their long term net was likely always much more often than not a net gain.
Could a single 16nm ASIC miner be inexpensive to produce?
Back to the main subject, this could help balance out the motivations of the very large miners to some extent, to reflect more of the will of the users as seen in the nodes/SegWit ready software stats.

What's being examined here is if one is only increasing the count for the vote, which has these negative implications:
1. They are shilling and giving a false sense of support.
2. They apparently didn't care much about bitcoin prior to the vote, making them more likely to be a civil war supporter than a bitcoin supporter.
3. They probably are not in it for the right reasons and in all likelihood the node will disappear conveniently after it's not needed to influence the vote anymore.

When you say you did the research can you explain your process?  
Just about everyone wants more transaction capacity, while not everyone agrees that the best and safest way to do it is via bigger blocks first.
Back to the original question, have you considered and compared the ideas on both sides of the debate?  Do you know the arguments that Core has made?  Do you have the technical competence to evaluate them properly?  When comparing the two main teams at odds here, Core and Classic have you evaluated the track record of each team?   Toomim is imploding and Hearn's actions should give everyone that was supporting him great pause, but apparently it hasn't, which is another concern to consider.  "Nevermind our leader was a traitor, he was right!"


That's hardly a thoughtful standard to hold decisions to.  It's not about the world ending, it's about setting dangerous precedents.

Here's the problem.  The community are primarily users.  Core are devs.  2MB blocksize is not a feature, it is an implementation choice to meet the goal of a requested feature.  The feature to the best that I can guess since the process is upside down is to be able to support 10-14 TPS.  If you were a developer and users said "use a linked list" when you knew the correct implementation for the feature they were requesting was a b-tree, and you were culpable, invested in the product yourself and the feature risked the collective investments of many more people, you would do a few things:
1. Communicate to the user exactly that. "Don't worry, we are working toward your request."
2. Ignore the users specific implementation request and work toward the feature they ultimately wanted using the implementation you deem correct (as the expert on the subject matter).
Core is doing exactly that.
This whole exercise is absurd.
So "feedback from the community" is "we want more transactions per second", not "we want you to do it this specific way by raising the block size".  That undermines the value of these seasoned and proven developers and puts the security of the network in the hands of laymen.

Seems like governments and the movie/music industries spend quite a bit of resources to get these shut down.  I can't help but think that if it was a direct interest of governments and also central bankers the push would be significantly harder.

Thin blocks even's bandwidth out but does not reduce the overall bandwidth usage, so it is good but not a catch all solution.  And, core is working on this and other improvements.

I've heard that there has been a lot of progress on that front with compact blocks.  I would think upstream bandwidth would be the limiting factor if we scale on chain in the near term.  The beauty of SegWit+LN on that front is it serves a similar purpose with respect to disk space and bandwidth in that only the LN nodes you transact with need to bear the burden of most of the transactions, only the opening and closing transactions hit the Bitcoin nodes.

"Safe" was as in would not risk the bitcoin network and it was a paraphrasing of Gavin's claims about his original blocksize increase proposals.
Then Toomim shows up, does some testing (reportedly) and claims that 4MB might not even be "safe" (however he defines it).  You might want to ask him what he considers safe.  He claims he's a miner btw.
My point was that it looks like the Core team may have it right by playing it conservative as not to risk compromising the network, when even the team pushing bigger blocks is dialing back their apparently wild claims, according to themselves.

Very productive James.  Even if these were true representations of your intent and not just an obvious revisionist back pedaling face saving measure, how would that work?

You never responded (MO to the first thread and or to any of these points:
1. Can individuals voluntarily nominate themselves without approval of the other congress people? Nope, and therein lies the main flaw in your proposal. 
2. Others include the leveragability of humans, 
3. the fact that you can't tell what known people are colluding any better than you can tell what anonymous people are colluding. And, 
4. the big miners aren't anonymous.
While you are at it, why not elaborate on why you thought it better to [delete your own comments from this thread](  Hardly the actions one would expect from a somewhat public figure with a high opinion of himself.

Since when?  I'd be interested in where you got such an idiotic idea.  This country was founded on limited government.

As a matter of fact that characterization is an affront to liberty - the liberty of the one paying.  Seems you're the one in need of schooling.
As for the rest of your liberal shit, just saying it doesn't make it true (remember you wrote that).  I have no problem with you worshiping your statist deity as long as it doesn't infringe my rights.  When you ask me to pay for your choices I'll tell you to fuck off.
You may also want to ask yourself why you think it's OK for you to try to use the state to do things that you wouldn't do personally.  If you wouldn't force your neighbor to write a check to pay for your kid's college or abortion, you should have equal reservations about the government exerting that force on your behalf.  But you'd actually have to do some thinking to understand that concept.  Based on what you've written so far the odds are very low you have the mental capacity.

Just a friendly reminder that you may want to edit this post to reflect the 50% revelation from your dialog with as not to have the it be misinterpreted.
I too was hoping this would mean a 1/100th to 1/40th of the overall bandwidth, but I see now the fact that the node needs to receive the transactions themselves does seem to indicate that your total "after" bandwidth would be at best 50% + 1/100th of 50%.
I read somewhere else that you also need to factor some % as new node traffic too (pulling down the whole blockchain to a new node).

The point of that comment was, if a few wallets make it a default option (very unlikely) and that the user tries to pay in person, in advance of getting to the cashier (somewhat uncommon) or a payment code is used that somehow does not communicate the non-rbf nature to the customer (unlikely) only then would this happen.  This will probably never happen.  If it does some bad decisions were made by wallet providers and payment processors and/or merchants.  EVEN in that unlikely event, the normal default of "oops I better not do that again" would kick in.  As does happen in real life if for example you have no cash and the merchant does not accept credit cards.
The problem gets solved outside of the payment process.  For example, "we'll hold your product until your payment clears", "we'll hold your ID until the payment clears so you can drink your coffee while it's hot"...

You're making invalid and frankly silly assumptions.  I seem to remember another time in recent history where 2 nations increased their stockpile with enough munitions to destroy all life on Earth a few times over, yet the result was not a single death.  The same applies to "men with guns".
Peace doesn't come from an asymmetry of power.  Quite the opposite.  You might want to look into how much death results from asymmetrical power.  There's lots in the history books about it, much of it recent (last 100 years).  Apparently you were unaware.  Here's a starting point for your education:
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:57:44
He's lying by omission.  The truth is significantly more complicated, though "at the moment" would have made the statement much more accurate.
As bitcoin adoption is quickly growing, demand for transaction is pushing it's underlying transaction capacity of the base network.  Bitcoin currently can scale via services like BitPay and other centralized "2nd layer" solutions as those transactions don't use as many valuable resources of the main bitcoin network.  Some have proposed that we don't need a 2nd layer solution and can simply increase the capacity of the base network via allowing it to consume more underlying resources (bandwidth, disk space).  Most realize that because of the network topology of bitcoin, massive redundancy to ensure security, the 1st layer network cannot effectively and safely scale to meet massive demand.  There are also significant challenges to that make that option complicated at least and existentially risky at worst. (I'm sparing you the technical details as it would take pages to present completely).
There are also decentralized 2nd layer solutions that will likely be considered part of the bitcoin network once complete, that offer a significant improvement in terms of transactions per user per day, among other important features like privacy improvements.  The 1st phase of the most prominent improvement is currently deployed but awaiting activation.  To ensure bitcoin's integrity that software must essentially be voted for by an overwhelming majority of the network to become active, which has not yet happened (and may never).  As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the fact that this software has not activated is a sign of the resilience of the network, as the underlying protocols cannot easily be changed, by definition, to be resistant to attacks.  Imagine if anyone could easily just modify banking protocols - there would be chaos.
Other scaling solutions are already in the works as well.  Some that may not require underlying changes to the protocol.
So a more fair characterization is that bitcoin is at a scaling cusp where the current transaction capacity of it's base network is being stressed.  Solutions have been deployed but may or may not be active soon to address that.  Thankfully there are already many existing 2nd layer solutions in use every day alleviating some of that demand.  Hopefully soon we will have better and more broad 2nd layer solutions to address the increasing demand for transactions. in all likelihood there will eventually be a 2nd layer solution that is considered to be part of the base network that will improve scale so bitcoin transactions can continue to be common and relatively inexpensive while maintaining and protecting the core value propositions of bitcoin,  permission-less, censorship-free, deflationary, decentralized control.
Those who don't value or need those unique properties have a multitude of other options available including all the world's fiat currencies, precious metals and the many payment networks including VISA/MC/Paypal etc.  
At this particular moment in time (at this intersection of adoption and scale) bitcoin might not be the best suited to small every day transactions, but hopefully soon it will.  And as you can see, transactions like this are still possible, they just may be a bit slow (potentially very slow) or expensive, at the moment.

I think it would be appropriate after [your somewhat controversial post]( that you update the community on your findings and perhaps correct any mistakes, misinformation and perhaps even more bad feelings that may have resulted from it.  I think it should at least be clear at this point that your estimated $10 fee is by no means an accurate characterization of normal fees and so likely should not have been highlighted in your chosen title as the new norm:
"**Here's a transaction with a ten-dollar transaction fee. This the bitcoin you want? Cause this the bitcoin you have now. (More in comments)**"

Trying to imply the core developers have co-opted anything is ridiculous.  It's open source.  The fact that BU just cloned the source repository and created their own flavor is proof that your original statement is undeniably false.




You just contradicted yourself, claiming what I said wasn't true and then repeating essentially the same thing. "Users choose to run the code" vs. "developers have no power in bitcoin - users chose code...".  You also say "developers have no power" which contradicts your earlier assertion that "A small number of players have co-opted the network" and that those players are a "hand full of incumbent developers", meaning the core developers.  You're inconsistent with yourself, which I find hilarious.


Citations necessary. 
Gavin was boxed out after splitting from the development consensus processes. Gavin suggested 20MB blocks was safe when it's well established now that at the time it definitely wasn't (and likely still isn't today). Gavin's admin privileges were removed after "confirming" that "Craig  Wright was Satoshi" when he clearly was not.  So either Gavin was duped, making him vulnerable via being easily duped, or he was part of some sort of conspiracy (much less likely IMO).  He could still have contributed to Core but chose not to.  
The link you posted was a clear attempt by Gavin at face saving that happened much later.  There is a 5 minute proof the real Satoshi could have used. Any other attempt was clearly a scam.  Impassioned writing doesn't change that simple fact.  Also if you study Satoshi's known writing and posts, it's clear as day that Wright is not the same person.  So nothing other than a message signed with known Satoshi private keys should have been acceptable yet somehow Gavin missed all the signs.  I'm glad he's not got commit privileges but would be happy if he wanted to contribute to Core via peer reviewed code.
I'm not as familiar with the story behind Garzik.
You've apparently attempted to conflate the experiences of 2 people with that of all 300+ "ex-core" developers but have not presented any evidence of that.  It's very likely that some contributors went on to their own projects or simply made contributions as a function of the projects they were already working on, as happens with most open source projects.  If you want to make a claim otherwise, please provide some evidence.

Yes, but you'll notice they don't mention a specific time as it makes more sense to optimize usage of the space before just opening it up wide in the name of future demand.  So suggesting we'll eventually need hundreds of MB per block today as if it means we should do it today before SegWit is like suggesting in 1981 that since we'd eventually need trillions of IP addresses we shouldn't have deployed IPv4.  If you didn't mean to suggest it as if a simple block size increase needs to happen today, then I agree and as you mentioned it's part of Core's plan, which makes the post even less relevant.  Most people I've seen in this sub are open to a block size increase, just not as the totality of the solution and certainly not before exhausting other reasonable alternatives.
If you don't understand the parallel to IPv4, here's some of the backstory:
[In 2010 people were suggesting we would run out of IP address within 1 year.](
As you can see from [this chart]( IPv6 still has very low adoption despite it now being 6 years after the prediction running out of "max IPv4 address space".
SegWit is a logical first step, LN and other 2nd layer solutions are logical next steps and a block size increase, if necessary certainly could follow.  Like the predicted lifespan of IPv4 (and it's max IP limit) has long outlasted many of the early predictions thanks to other innovations, SegWit+LN and other likely innovations on those may significantly extend the life of a 1MB on-chain limit - potentially forever but only time will tell.  Time will also relax the centralization pressures of larger block sizes as internet speeds continue to increase and the costs of that bandwidth, cpu and storage continue to decrease.

Why can't they just stick to converting existing nodes that have been historically supporting Bitcoin?  They can't, so instead they are increasing the node count.  I suspect these are not long term supporters of Bitcoin, just shills for the vote.  The nodes will likely reflect the same.
It's not really that important as they are not very effective and will likely achieve nothing more than wasting money and perhaps perpetrating the myth that there is a viable civil war.  
The outcome looks as if it will be the same as with XT.  20MB didn't work, 8MB didn't work, Toomim even reportedly said 4MB will not work and yet here they are still fighting for their fork with amazing amounts of bluster for 2MB, as if all those prior attempts either hadn't happpened or were well thought out and had potential.

Erik, I don't think there is such a thing as "social consensus".  Examining the dialog here for the last year and the varying degrees of understanding, and the quickness to comment despite that low level of understanding on the part of most people leads me to that conclusion.  I also think most redditors are young and inexperienced so there's probably a bit more of an emotional bias than there would be otherwise.
For some reason in this situation non-technical people have become vocal activists for particular technical solutions.  This is IMO the biggest problem in the current debate.  If people would stick to making feature requests rather than being so audacious as to assert they know better than people who actually do have a more complete set of experience then this problem would be minimized.  You don't tell your mechanic how to fix your car or your doctor how to treat your cancer (while you can of course opt out).  You choose people you trust and let them use their experience to guide them to the best solution to the problem or request.  Get a second opinion sure, but in this case it's no contest.
I think we need to step back and look at the damage that Mike has caused this entire community by politicizing it.  The core devs have been incredibly patient despite relentless unfounded character attacks, never-ending streams of idiotic FUD spreading and now this latest coup by someone with questionable judgement (getting on slack high and not apologizing afterwards - maybe he's not come down yet?) wit minimal experience and apparently has his own potential conflict of interest (his brother's pet project - I'm not holding that against him just point out the double standard).  
Time to grow up, relax, we are in good hands and perhaps even make some apologies and express some outward gratitude to people that have been much maligned while at the same time keeping this very important first of it's kind experiment alive.  It's got to be a very stressful job and lately it's also been thankless.

Win for riders (users) cheaper cost per mile, win for bus companies (those leveraging the 2nd layer capability) deriving value from the efficiency of volume, win for tax payers (node operators) saving money on infrastructure, win for toll collectors (miners) more toll money collected.

You're peaking as high as 10Mbps upstream which is significant and potentially expensive (if even available) in many parts of the world.  If I've done my 1.2 mbps to GB/month calculation properly that's also just under 400 GB of upload data per month.
AND that's before multiplying it by 2 (or 8 if you were an XP supporter).  Even some modern countries like Australia have caps on bandwidth and/or charge for overages and generally upstream is more limited and expensive than downstream.

I agree with you.  It just seem important to make clear to people the possible attack vectors.  I think many assume miners are rational inside the system when they may not be.  They also assume Gavin and others are working toward bitcoin's success (which they may or may not be).  Most people would consider that type of deception immoral.

I think it matters what perspective you're looking from.  If you're concern is miners/users in countries with data caps then overall bandwidth use is a concern.

It's just important to make clear the real world implications which vary based on a variety of differing constraints depending the internet service available throughout the world.

To ensure a small number of players cannot co-opt the network.


A consensus should be required to change them.  With Segwit the activation threshold is 95%.  With BU miners are finally suggesting 80% but it has been argued that even a lower threshold could be forced.

It's almost as if "low fees" are like the myth of consequence "free price" controls or "rent control".  "Let the market work" the BU supporters chant while pushing what amounts to price controls that ignore the underlying costs.  Imagine having to consider those costs of the block space and mind you in perpetuity...
I'd think in light of that the preferred order would be SegWit and LN first, then, if needed and if no other better innovation or optimization was found, only then an increase to the raw block size.  In light of that it seems funny that Olivier wan's the raw block size increase simultaneous or before SegWit.
Free education, free health insurance and free blockspace all of them having non-zero costs.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:39:38
They may have both, if the government is funding them.  Most people don't seem to mention this possibility.  It's entirely possible that incentive or leverage from outside the Bitcoin system is driving them so an "incentive" based analysis must include this potential.  BU never seems to account for that possibility while it is central the the philosophy of Core to consider bad actors and their potential impact.
TL;DR China certainly has an incentive to kill Bitcoin as an avenue for capital flight.

Small modifications to hundreds of thousands of lines of code is nothing to scoff at.  How many did you modify?
No one suggests they are not replaceable, they are just the most experienced and have done a pretty good job so far of keeping this experiment running, constantly improving the code and providing a path to scalability while focusing on what makes bitcoin unique.  That's likely what the miners recognized.  The alternative team seemed quite green and volatile to me and clearly lacked the depth of insight required for something so critical.
I think Core has earned loyalty in a meritocratic way, but you obviously feel differently which is fine.  But perhaps instead of being resentful, or whatever it is your feeling you should do something about it, like get to coding.  You can't expect to garner confidence simply by posting negativity, and by resenting those who have earned respect you come off as petty.

from: 
"The actual size of a block under Segwit depends on the kind of transactions being included, however the figure of 1.7MB was based on the average transaction profile in January 2015. At the time of writing (Nov 2016), it would be around 2.1MB."
@_date: 2016-01-06 07:17:04
1. I think you have no way of accurately estimating the number of nodes that would remain running based on arbitrary block sizes and that you are just making your numbers up.
2. I think (and it's not just me) that with too aggressive of an increase (as noted, it's hard to know as there are many variables) many nodes would be forced into data centers where they'd be more vulnerable to regulatory capture.
3. I think also like many others, that the solution should be well designed and the implications thought out, tested and vetted.  Most redditors seem to just scream "raise the block size" as if it has no other implications.  Some even don't understand that it's primarily a bandwidth issue, not a storage issue, like you.

I read the whole kindle preview. I like you're writing style and from what I saw in the preview I think you picked a great set of content to tackle and nailed the largest target group both in terms of being needed and currently under-served.
From what I can tell (and for what my opinion is worth) so far I think you've done a good job and introduced and simplified some important groundwork.  Some of the concepts I think you may have left a bit technical for the average reader, for example the programming notation on your one way function example is likely not easily recognized by someone not having programmed software the "^" exponent specifically.  It might be worthwhile to at least superscript that one.
Not to sound critical with another point, but in the priv/pub key section maybe you could have used fewer actual keys as they clutter the text, and perhaps used shorter representations.  Also a combination lock with 10 numbers on your transparent mailboxes might be another good analog for public keys and their asymmetric nature.  If you know the combo you can open it right up, otherwise you'll be trying to permute up to 10^10 times.
I'll definitely consider dropping the $16 on it though physical texts tend to put me to sleep.  Will there be a kindle version?

Does this look like a product with no customers? 
Take your cliches and file them away.  This project is much more important than any other product or "customization" of recent history.  This is much more like the internet.  The internet wouldn't have been very good at being a platform for innovation if it was controlled by a few entities or was regulated extensively or was unstable.  Bitcoin is the same.  Core has the priorities straight, decentralization and stability first, scale 2nd.
Also, sometime's your customer is wrong because they don't even know what TCP/IP is.  Sometimes your future customers are your present day enemies, for example the big telecoms routing most of their call traffic over the internet.  In the future when the private blockchain ideas fail this will likely be the same with banks.
This is a platform not a product in the traditional sense.  It may well be the most disruptive technological accomplishment in generations.
This is new ground and your old cliches don't apply in the same way that they do to old industries.

Reading through all the comments in this thread I see you're very outspoken yet [here]( you finally acknowledge that you don't really know what consensus (in the relevant sense) is and that you need to do more research and "thinking".
Has it ever occurred to you that instead of phrasing your comments as authoritative statements you could simply rephrase them as questions?  This would serve 4 purposes:
1. To signal that you are not sure of your position and seeking to fill in the gaps.
2. To notify others not to take your position as one of an authority.
3. To solicit a positive response.
4. To avoid ultimate concession and embarrassment when someone more knowledgeable corrects you.
Number 2 is quite important as you are essentially spreading FUD to those who don't follow your threads to the point that  occurs, which may in many cases not occur at all, if for example folks like u/belcher_ were not here to help correct for it.

"Shitty" seems like a loaded term.  How about "adds no benefit"?
AFAIK, as long as there is a "7 degrees of Kevin Bacon" between sender and recipient, even one time payments may be able to go over LN.  I've read that routing is somewhat of a question mark at the moment but I am not up to date.  That said, even if one time payments didn't go through LN consider your own payment profile.  If you are like most people you likely have many more repeat transactions than one time.  If those repeating transactions were reduced to 2 transactions per some period than every time, they'd clearly compress your main-chain usage.  Also, streaming services that are otherwise infeasible would then be feasible.
I also imagine there will be layers on top of LN for more innovative solutions that we likely can't yet imagine.  Think of how today we have things that we could not have imagined in 1994, for example cloud based Virtual Machines backing our smart phones.
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:22:51

@_date: 2017-03-25 02:50:15
Glad we got that cleared up.
It would also seem more rational to improve block usage first, and then increase block size.   Certainly when the fix is already in place, solves other problems and increases the potential of the protocol.  I find this analogous to first getting rid of excess stuff and then moving, rather than the other way around.  In this case the cost of the excess stuff is perpetual and multiplied across resources on the network.
Any miner trying to stop innovation like that is not only hurting the system, they are hurting themselves.  Most people can do the math that without the block chain underlying the network, the 2nd layer can't really do much.
The thing we also haven't touched on is that 2nd layer solutions offer more privacy and if Jihan hasn't noticed, there's quite a demand for privacy (half of the top 4 market cap coins - ignore bank-coin). 
Should be an interesting next few months.

@_date: 2016-03-21 19:54:36
I appreciate your replies.  That said, you seem to have all the pieces but fail to see the big picture issue I initially pointed out.  As a practical matter either 20MB was OK or it was not.  It seems like this indicates it was not:








Unless you think enabling "penalizing of the rest of the world" is a good thing, that's a reason that 20MB could have caused major problems (certainly if 4MB might have).  Forcing the 1MB cap keeps possibly ill incentivized miners (on the other wall of the Great Firewall) from pushing their caps so high as to create that disadvantage for everyone else.


According to this:  "Weak Blocks and IBLTs" sounds a lot like thin blocks, and apparently that is on their roadmap hopefully to hit this year.  I think the reason it's not being pushed as a higher priority is they are prioritizing scaling via Segwit and then LN, not via larger blocks where the issue stems from.  In other words, while it might be a high priority for Classic since they want to double the block size (capacity) and therefore the bandwidth requirement, Core's scaling solution doesn't have that issue.  That said, it's still on their roadmap as it will likely make running a node cheaper.  TL;DR: It's not essential to the Core scaling solution, while it is for Classsic's.

Well, not exactly.  I'm at an advantage because I can make a coherent argument.  This is apparently too much to ask from you.  You're satisfied at deferring your political position to the corporate media (what could possibly go wrong there?).
Even your Trump health care example that you type-laugh at (adorable) shows no inconsistency whatsoever.  The first 2 quotes don't contradict the 3rd.  It is certainly complicated.  Your apparent issue is that you just completely buy the story the media is so emphatically trying to deliver (instead of just reporting).

Just a suggestion, of course you're free to do whatever you'd like.
If this money is important enough to you that the dip panicked you, you probably shouldn't have that money in bitcoin.  Weak hands are easy prey for market manipulators which makes you more likely to lose money, as you may have now learned.
Another option, put less in and be content to HODL, or only panic trade part and HODL the rest.
Good luck to you (and us all).

LOL.  Levity break.
In all seriousness, it would be a tragedy if all/much of this infighting stemmed from the language gap.  It might help if someone truly fluent in the languages and tech can explain that:
1. 2nd layer solutions already exist and have definitely helped adoption and therefore demand and price 
2. 2nd layer solutions will continue to exist and be developed even on top of BU 
3. LN, if it lives up to expectations, would likely bring a ton more on chain fees from it's own usage and by allowing exponential scale and therefore bringing more people to Bitcoin further increasing it's price and the value of on chain transactions (if it doesn't live up to expectations, then he'll likely have his on chain scaling stop-gap)

The two mistakes you make are 
1. to assume that someone holding a retirement's worth of bitcoin would not have already considered as much.  If someone had the will to keep a $20K initial investment from 2012, they clearly understand the ups and downs and have weathered them.  It also seems a bit odd and arrogant for someone to suggest they are "far too exposed" without knowing anything else about the specific situation. Different people have different risk tolerances, which was the point of my initial comment.
2. You also seem to look at bitcoin as purely an investment when many here clearly see it as a vehicle for wealth protection.  Bitcoin offers unique qualities that many other assets do not.  So it's a choice, rather than a trading opportunity.

Electoral Votes for Trump 304 - Clinton 207.  That's a landslide.
Before continuing on your popular vote nonsense, perhaps you should research the electoral college and it's reason for existence.  If not for the Electoral College the agenda of those who live in cities would overrule those of more rural areas.

Just putting this out there based on nothing more than a gut feel/concern.  Is it possible that McAfee is the bad actor?  People have long suspected that virus scanning companies had some sketchy business practices and frankly what better way to attack and control a device than under the guise of protecting it.  Virus software has access to all files on your system.
Maybe the current debate is so contentious because it is actually the battle between the Fed/IRS/surveillance state and the privacy rights of the people.  It's certainly a lot more convenient to do chain analysis if there is one master ledger, the result of BU winning, than it is with a system like LN or other 2nd layer solution.

Where are ads suggested?  What I see in the Qualcomm video is plug and play mesh/repeaters that they suggest offer never before seen speeds.  If the theory I put forward that they would be funded via bitcoin and electricity cost is correct (I could be way off, just speculating here) then there would be no need for ads.
Large companies and individuals could conceivably shave off a fortune in infrastructure and internet access charges with decentralized mesh networks.

No offense but your point is a non-point.  It would be like arguing that all the solutions to scale IPv4 to the world didn't exist in 1981 so therefore it would require "solution X" before we could trust it.
This line of argument neglects that:
1. solutions emerge, build and improve upon prior layers
2. known technology improves independently, for example in 5 years we can expect much higher upstream bandwidth prevalence, cheaper internet access, computing and storage.
Also if LN can get us to 10,000,000 active users per year inside of 2 years on LN, considering we likely already have that many (and growing) using the other existing 2nd layer solutions (centralized exchanges, BitPay etc.) even discounting other future innovations  will get us to a safer block size increase if  doesn't render that unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:16:27
Attempting to delay the malleability fix is not a long term strategy.  It is clearly a short term desperate and misguided attempt to stop progress that benefits the rest of the community and it will be treated as such by the community.
Adding insult to injury, the malleability fix isn't even strictly required for 2nd layer protocols, so whether or not they succeed in the short term they will lose in the long term.  Their only chance at success is to align themselves with the community.

At this present phase it solves 2 critical problems:
1. Adoption.  You can now use bitcoin to pay for things anywhere VISA/MC is accepted.  This also makes it much more likely for someone to accept bitcoin directly as they can spend it essentially anywhere. These cards have essentially single-handedly solved the bootstrapping problem.
2. Scale.  These transactions generally occur off chain.

It could, but it'd be a pretty bad argument since the same people are actually introducing amazing innovations to drastically increase the transactions per second while not increasing resource utilization excessively.  That'd be a pretty wacky plan.


True statement, but I bet these governments can barely handle getting their heads around bitcoin.  Also, the other alts are not really a threat at the moment, but they are certainly gaining ground.

Even if we take your argument as fact and to disregard that the space required is multiplied by the number of nodes, SegWit+LN (or other 2nd layer solution) offers an efficiency improvement and more opportunities for privacy improvement.  Just because some say in theory brute force scaling could work does not imply it's the best way to scale.  In fact, most web scale benefits from multiple layers and solutions for example, using CDNs for static content, caching proxies, load balancers, performant code and finally brute force scale (more machines).

I think this is a really interesting perspective.  Basically perhaps the markets are just working.  If mining centralization is a problem, people could be putting their R&amp;D money into it fixing that.  
The idea that this is an indicator and harbinger of another imbalance is also very interesting to consider.
It reminds me of discussions about oil production and energy security.  These are complex systems and concepts that can't really be summed up in a single sentence, for example "foreign energy dependence is bad".  Is it, or are we depleting foreign supplies to keep local supplies available in case of geopolitical complications?  
Along similar lines, Chinese miners have more of the current reward and control but also more of the risk if there is a failure.  They also may be selling their assets at relative bargain prices benefiting people in other nations (at the cost of their local tax payers via electricity subsidies).  Think too of the Japanese auto invasion.  Was that good or bad for people in the US, or even the US automakers.  It's hard to tell in short snapshots, more complexity is exposed over time.
Another example, in this case China is doing all the investment and other nations may be able to leverage their investment to leapfrog them if/when it becomes more important.  Kind of how some nations can jump straight to wireless telecom without the expense of older tech like copper phone lines.
Thanks for the thought provoking post/ideas.  It's got me thinking about things from a different perspective.

If reddit (definitely in disarray) was equivalent to the bitcoin community then I'd agree we were in trouble, but I'm not sure that Core could fix it.  Thankfully I don't think they are equivalent though there is no doubt overlap.  It would be great to see some numbers.  My guess is that the economic majority agrees with Core or has no basis to make a judgement.  I think we are hearing the squeaky (and irrational) wheels.
Also, I think it's our job as responsible, perhaps older than average, rational thinkers to help calm the nerves of the over excited youngsters and help them to become rational deep thinkers that will hopefully pay it forward.  
Time also fixes many problems.  When the sky doesn't fall hopefully that will help people learn some valuable lessons, though I have been surprised before.

So first, I'm not.  I think ideally people should pay for their own children's expenses.  As someone that already "knows" they are not having kids you should identify with the problem of paying for other's actions.
If one cannot afford to educate their kids they shouldn't have kids as they are clearly not up to the responsibility.
Your thinking is also shallow.  It's similar to saying "having a rich populace is a good in itself."  Yeah, that would be great.  The problem is that mankind has not figured out a way to do that without unintended consequences (see Communism).  
As a practical matter, expanding access to higher education via government loans (socialization of loans and losses) has led to an education bubble.  The government providing and guaranteeing loans has expanded the demand artificially which has allowed educational institutions to raise prices.
If we didn't artificially expand the demand, universities would be competing for a smaller set of students, or having to become more efficient to stay profitable (admitting more students with lower per student margin).
These are dynamics built into the free market by default.  Attempting to exert energy and control over them does not fix anything, it just mutates the dynamics.
Wouldn't things be better if instead of huge loans you'll need to pay back if instead you had access to less expensive quality education driven by market based competition?
If I were graduating high school right now I'd take a free internship to get real world experience.  Making nothing and building a resume sure beats 4 years of debt accrual and academic knowledge.  Unfortunately not all careers are created equal as doctors and layers require strict accreditation. But that may soon be changing as technology eats education and accreditation can happen via testing and performance.

I'm surprised that some people can't see that this is simply a meritocracy and rightly so.
By my recollection the last time someone attempted to compete with Core they only managed to garner 10% support (despite bold claims and loud voices), and then the leader left in disgrace taking his ball with him and destroying his credibility and reputation which should have shaken up his supporters but surprisingly it didn't.  
This is also a reason I think this time will be no different.  The same people, unable to see the difference in contributions, stability, insights and wisdom are revolting.  Nothing to see here.
Add to that the proposed make-shift "leader" this time is a lot less impressive and while he may be able to change a couple constants and copy paste some code he doesn't have the long track record of success that Core does.  I doubt miners would trust his judgement on how to scale the network over Core.
In the future there may be a significant fracture but it will likely only gain real traction if the new team is made up of significantly vetted and proven contributors making the meritocratic judgement more difficult.
IMO the meritocracy is working.  Let's all just relax and try to spend time more productively.

This is also one of the early reasons that Core pushed the issue with block size.  If interim scale could be achieved simply by raising the block size we would not have seen the motivation to innovate until there was a real problem (more adoption that a block size increase could not safely satisfy).  It was well known that a block size increase could not meet future scale needs all by itself so rather than kick the ball down the road to when it would be even harder to address, they forced the issue earlier.  Thankfully we have SegWit deployed (not activated) and LN (and other 2nd layer solutions) in testing because of that wisdom.  To reach closure SegWit must be activated as the same motivations still exist as this post explains. Only then can the idea of increasing the block size be re-opened.

I'll spell it out for you.  According to the coin.dance chart 317 BU nodes came back online out of the 371 that went down, so 85% back online within a day.  If these were nodes all controlled by individual users we'd expect them to come online at the users' respective convenience.  The chart would show a some % of nodes each day coming back.  85% seems a bit high not to suspect that many were spawned from the same root instance.  For example at Amazon EC2 someone can create a root image and spawn 1000 new instances of it as easy as they can spawn 1.
We saw a similar thing happen on May 16 last year with Classic which can be seen [here]( (click view lifetime) when many nodes just shutdown all on the same day.  The likelihood of many individual users shutting their nodes down on the same day seems pretty low.
Also notice the March 16 2016 spike and dip in Classic.  That's not organic.
It's clear that BU is using a Sybil attack to inflate their numbers.  Also notice how the core node count is relatively constant, no big dips or rises, except for yesterday when it's likely some of the real BU nodes were switched to Core out of necessity.

I'm with you on that in general.  That said, in this particular case the specifics matter and are relevant.  It's much less likely that the US citizens would lie down to nationalization of all mining operations for example.  It's also less likely that it would happen in the first place.  That said, with the right media outlets and some freshly minted laws the public could clearly be duped. Still I think it's less likely.
Also, I think part of what may have been missed is that if there was a high concentration of hash power in any country (no matter the country) that would be a negative thing.
As for low level anti-Chinese sentiment, I've not seen it.  Every case I've ever seen where China or Chinese miners has come up has to do with these specific concerns, not anything to do with it's people.

IMO this is a great post and it does an excellent job of covering the recent developments.  I do disagree with the author's final suggestion though:
"I don’t have a solution for the first contradiction. But I do for the second. I submit that Bitcoin has grown in size and importance to the point that it now needs some equivalent of the IETF or ICANN. (Before anyone brings it up: no, not like the Bitcoin Foundation.) That’s a deeply staid, boring, bureaucratic notion, I know, especially for a revolutionary anarchic decentralized cryptocurrency. But technical decisions made under that kind of political aegis would be easier to accept for all concerned. Perhaps the time has finally come for Bitcoin to become just a little bit more boring."
Isn't ICANN responsible for the centralized governance of domain names?
This is a new beast unlike anything before it.  The last thing we need is more politicians.  I trust the people who have successfully shepherded this amazing innovation thus far and who clearly have their goals as individuals and [as a company]( (in the case of those particular developers) aligned with the success and continuity of bitcoin.

You changed it from it being a reason for people to feel comfortable "accepting btc" (my [original point 1, 2nd sentence]( to people would never "showing that process to newbies will not convince them to abandon fiat for btc." (the bullshit you introduced out of nowhere)


Dude, here's what I wrote: "so full circle, **accepting** bitcoin [directly] and spending it via a bitcoin debit card is still a huge net positive."  Consistent with my original point, it's a way for people to justify **accepting** bitcoin because without the bitcoin debit cards they have hundreds of thousands less venues to spend it.
Let me spell it out since you're apparently the one with reading comprehension issues:
1. Accept bitcoin directly - the goal for "Adoption", again see point 1.
2. Spend bitcoin directly if available - perhaps tens of thousands of locations OR
3. Spend bitcoin via bitcoin debit card - hundreds of thousands of locations
Without option 3 someone would feel much less comfortable accepting bitcoin since the first question they'd likely ask is "where the hell can I spend this stuff?" A much more compelling answer than  above is "anywhere you use your credit card now, so basically everywhere."


No, again, learn to read.  From the perspective of the merchant **accepting bitcoin directly** because they can be sure they will be able to **spend it almost anywhere**.

It's more complicated than a quota.  It's intended to protect the network from attack, not artificially limit the economics as evidenced by the fact that the same team invented a different way to increase the transactions per second, and relieve some fee pressure while better aligning incentives, and which also leads to exponential scale per underlying block size instead of just linear.  Summing this up as a "quota" is a mischaracterization.


Please explain exactly how.  There are 6 implementations of LN and they are all open source.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:17:43
With this question you are re-framing the context.
We should be aware and concerned if the miners are acting immorally and treat them accordingly.  Likewise we should be concerned if the Chinese government is attacking bitcoin regardless of assessing the morality.  Inside vs. outside actors both deserve scrutiny.  Inside actors should be called out as there are inherent assumptions made that they "support bitcoin", when in fact they may not.  There is no such assumption made in respect to the Chinese government.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:05:01
You changed the argument.  The cards are not meant to increase adoption of the cards.  They are meant to be a vehicle for people to spend bitcoin anywhere so that they can feel comfortable to accept bitcoin for services.  Reminder, merchants pay up to 3% to accept credit cards, so full circle, accepting bitcoin and spending it via a bitcoin debit card is still a huge net positive.


Another straw man. You're conflating adoption with complete transition.  This is a common tactic, but logically invalid.


So you can easily accept a global bearer currency that cannot be blocked or charged back, and spend it locally for whatever you want.  Can your regular cc do that?

You're a little slow.  The silk road was on the dark web.  This is hosted at a normal domain on the visible web.  It would take law enforcement a day to shut them down.
The discounts come from people with Amazon credit either received via affiliate programs, mechanical turk credits or just gift cards.  See cardpool.com, raise.com etc. to see the discount people are willing to accept converting converting gift cards to cash.  It's generally 15%.  There are many reasons that speculators might even pay the 5 - 20+% premium to buy bitcoin via purse.io, they may not have access to reputable exchanges, they may want "off the books" bitcoin etc.  Many BTMs even charge 10-15%.

You obviously have not used bitcoin to buy anything online because the experience is pretty amazing.  For digital items no information needs to be typed in, just snap a QR, confirm and download.

You weren't called out for being Rick Falkvinge, you were called out for being authoritative and authoritatively wrong, a bad combination.  Ideas do stand on their own.  In this case you were sensationalizing being incompetent at calculating your fees.  Not sure how that is "sound" in your mind.
You didn't need Armory to estimate your fees, just the transaction size.  You clearly didn't know how fees worked and rather than admit that and thank the people that helped you, take a humbling step back from your outrageous headline you doubled down on twitter and apparently are continuing on that same path.  A better course would have been to ask the community how to calculate the fee appropriately.  You chose to overestimate, complain and then use a straw man "is this the bitcoin you want, because this is the bitcoin you have."  This is not the bitcoin we have, it's the imaginary scenario you created, and at best it's a very fringe case.

Seems like getting paid back may not be the problem since "Credible Friends" is the intermediary.  The problem as I see it is this:
How much can I earn as a lender? -
"Borrowers are charged 25% APR interest using the average daily balance method. 60% of all interest and fees goes to the lender. Interest charges are applied to borrowers accounts monthly, and profits are received by lenders as payments are made by the borrower."
Seems like a pretty high interest rate and they are skimming 40% of it.  Be a lot easier and better for everyone to just loan your friend the money directly, barring the usual borrowing drama which clearly exists in both scenarios.

I don't think he was dismissing it for it's simplicity, just indicating that simplicity tends to appeal to people who don't understand the deeper issues "beyond it's surface layer", beyond their ability to analyze.  In the case of Bernie, his platform is all entitlements and increases in budget with one answer as to how to pay for it that doesn't add up mathematically.  Some people don't even think about the costs involved - everything is free!  The relation to this situation is people who don't understand complicated software interactions and game theory probably (clearly do) think "just change the damn number, it's as simple as that" when anyone who invests a bit of time and/or has some computing/programming experience likely understands that in this case it's not that simple.
I've really enjoyed your excellent comments!  Information asymmetry is the key, and expecting anyone to be able to resolve that is as futile expecting all people to be able to be doctors.

"Up until now every transaction on the Bitcoin network has been handled by the miners, and all fees have been given to miners."
The author seems to ignore the many hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of transactions that happen every day at exchanges and on centralized services that interact with Bitcoin.  We already have many 2nd layer solutions.  LN would decentralize that sort of functionality, which could be used by miners to establish new revenue streams, and it's open source.  SegWit+LN would also be more private than having all transactions on a central ledger, thus we will likely see even more use cases emerge, and more volume, higher prices and more on chain fees.  (Note the  and  coins by market cap and their primary value proposition. Hint: it's not transactions per second.)
LN and other 2nd layer solutions are a win-win for users and miners.

Good point.  Tough call.  I see the value of having an intermediary so I don't see that as a problem aside from the expensive 40% share, and the overall interest rate is nuts.  Who's going to be attracted to a system with higher rates than traditional credit cards?  10% would be much more attractive and leaves room for lenders to make more than they would in cash or a safe portfolio, while letting the borrower have a better rate than traditional credit cards.
There are other interesting questions like are you paid back in BTC or does the USD exchange rate come into play (per payment, at termination etc.).  There may be an opportunity for multiple options, some which could allow people to also hedge some of the volatility of bitcoin in exchange for a steady return.

The concern is that if the cost to run nodes becomes prohibitively expensive for individual users and forced into datacenters, they will be more susceptible to regulatory capture.

I noticed you didn't respond to anything having to do with your comparison to silk road.  I wonder why.


Using bitcoin if you don't have any would be difficult as would using fiat if you didn't have it or using credit cards if you didn't have one.  Then again to get bitcoin you just need to sign up with coinbase or circle, similar process to any brokerage account.  Not exactly a disaster.  Just like with your Amazon account once it's setup, a couple clicks, done.




Some of us see the benefit of not having to provide our secure credentials to make a purchase.  Bitcoin enables that use case like never before.  Devalue it all you want, but companies pay incredible sums to secure credit card info and there have been major hacks causing at the very least inconvenience to the consumer.  With bitcoin the secure keys never leave the wallet.
Not a zealot, just a rational thinker.

Also, you're spreading FUD.  If purse.io was used primarily for fraud it would have been shut down a long time ago.  You obviously don't know much about it.  Ever used it?  I have. 
Regarding merchants actually wanting it, a blanket statement doesn't cover everyone and a little research would make that clear.  There are many who use bitpay and coinbase and immediately convert to fiat but there are also people who directly accept bitcoin, many who chime in from time to time to drum up business.  To expect a brand new technology to be quickly adopted by everyone is asking a lot.  The debit card services are helping solve this bootstrapping problem since one can now accept bitcoin as it will be usable essentially anywhere via these cards.  Once critical mass is reached (not sure if/when) folks can ditch the middle man, perhaps for a different one like LN.  Time will tell.

When has an idea been so popular it failed because of scalability?
nails it.  This is a discussion of transaction throughput and laymen should shy away from weighing in about the specific approaches unless they are truly qualified, at which point I'd expect them to be working on solutions rather than discussing them.  Clearly even Erik and Roger have only a cursory understanding of the complexity of the details.  This discussion would have started with latency otherwise.
Remember too that there is complex game theory at play and this is a market that will evolve and grow organically.  Erik seems to indicate he thinks this as well.  Roger's assertions remind me of the over-simplistic high level Fed talking points that leave out or render unimportant all the important churn happening in the market itself and the unintended consequences.  Regarding immediately supporting Paypal level transaction throughput while not allowing a fee market, I think we can all see what sort of implications that might have.  Seems like changing the game at a critical juncture, like changing the tax code in a material way that affects businesses after they've invested in their businesses based on the prior code.  IMO the predictable model of Bitcoin's inflation should extend to other areas like scale and I think that means consensus, so all parties can see what's coming and plan for it.

And most everyone uses the dominant (yet still not the latest) version.
I think we are at the ugly Mosaic phase where things kind of work but don't look pretty and you kind of need to know what you are doing.  I expect with LN, usability will improve, adoption will expand, fees will remain much smaller and the underlying security will remain as strong as possible.
I think we will also start to see serious threats to the network by big players.

Aggregate your separate UTXOs on the weekends when fees are lower and do it sooner rather than later (as demand for Bitcoin is clearly increasing rapidly).  Then when you spend from fewer UTXOs your transactions will be smaller (fewer bytes) which will reduce the associated fee.
The title of this OP tries to misrepresent that the fee has something to do with the amount being sent.  It does not.  It's related to the size of the transaction in bytes.

What justifiable reason would there be for splitting funds and then joining them again at a single address?  This particular behavior is clearly not necessary for bitcoin to survive.  At best it's a fringe behavior and at worst it's an intentional attack.  My guess is the latter.
As i mentioned, perhaps demoing it to a group of people could explain it, but that cannot account for more than 5% of transactions at any given time much less 90%.
I would be in agreement with you if the coins were split and went off to all new addresses, but as it's been characterized they join back up again.

Betamax' problem was a lack of popularity, not a lack of ability to scale.
The argument is also not about which is superior, it's about the network failing because it won't scale.  "The 101 is so busy that nobody uses it."   The problem solves itself.  Transactions don't go through, less people use it, then transactions go through again.  In the meantime the devs continue to work on scale.

I'll give you some hints then you can do your own research:
Upstream bandwidth requirements
Node centralization and decline (due to higher and prohibitive costs for much of the world)
Orphaned blocks (for smaller miners)
More spam (think email but the storage costs are multiplied by thousands and are perpetual)
FYI, the nature of scale is that the problem always persists.  There are places on the globe that have no mobile service for example.  Mobile phones have still not yet scaled to cover them.  Soon they will have coverage and then they'll need more bandwidth as more uses for the service is created.  When there is no more rush hour traffic in NYC and LA we can consider the transportation problem "solved".

I think the answer is to stop talking about block size altogether and start talking about transactions per second or per block using some average transaction size and comparing segwit to non-segwit apples to apples.  That is clearly the most approachable way to explain that part of SegWit to non-technical people.

You clearly don't know much about bitcoin or the people that use it and why.  Bitcoin has much more in common with gold than for example fiat currency.
Regarding Bitcoin's advantages over gold: Bitcoin is unforgeable (cannot be counterfeited).  Bitcoin can also be buried underground but in a way that it can't be stolen if found (password protected) and the same bitcoin can be buried in 10 (or more, as many as you want) places at the same time.  Bitcoin can be transported across borders without carrying anything, simply by moving yourself across the border and knowing the location of your keys.  Bitcoin is arguably less manipulable than gold as production can be less centralized than gold.  Gold has a history of regulation and confiscation enabled by it being physical while Bitcoin is a lot like BitTorrent, that persists despite massive government crack-downs.  Likewise with legality.    Bitcoin can near effortlessly and near instantaneously be transported to any internet connected human being on Earth in a way that is unstoppable and irreversible.


This really highlights your lack of understanding.  An authority doesn't give bitcoin value, which is one of the main reasons it has value.

How does it work out with more inputs and outputs?
Also, it was my understanding that the witness data could be discarded after some time.  Is your analysis taking this into account?
You skipped the malleability and LN point.  Sometimes a lower layer change that may not make 100% sense while zoomed in makes sense in the larger context - the checksum example.
I've spoken with a few industry leaders recently (profitable bitcoin businesses) and they are fully on board supporting SegWit and in agreement it's the best way forward right now.  It may not be perfect but it's clear to me it's more of an engineered solution, with multiple benefits and thoughtful consideration of different implications, than simply scaling by raising a number.
Here's another analogy.  On the web we used to send all data uncompressed direct from the web server.  A simple website scale solution, comparable to simply increasing the blocksize, is to just add more servers, but that only addressed CPU load.  SegWit (to me) is more like getting scale by adding nginx in front of your server(s) to do load balancing, inline compression and caching.  It's more complicated, more lines of code, but it reduces load  and it reduces bandwidth requirements (among other things).  It's not meant to be a point by point equivalent, just to highlight that the blocksize is a primitive scaling mechanism.  SegWit is a thoughtful one.  What's also similar about the analogy is that once you have SegWit (nginx) you can also more safely and effectively increase the block size (add servers).  And that is exactly what's been talked about.
Final point, what I think is the unspoken reality is that hardcore bitcoin supporters don't want a precedent for a successful hard fork.  This would be dangerous in that it could encourage regulators to try and force one, for example to add blacklisting.  It would be better to be able to factually explain "there's never been a successful hard fork, so it could jeopardize the entire system."  This would add significant political risk to whatever government faction was trying to push the fork.

Theoretically, could a miner publish a static address where users could choose to send the "official fee"?  This way there would be a fee but only to the chosen miner.
This way the miner has a real financial incentive to mine the transaction which might fix the "lower than low priority" problem.  I also imagine people might even sending higher than standard fees to support their preferred miner and their policies.
To support multiple miners I think one could create a multi-sig (per given permutation of miners) and the miners could agree to divide it based on which one actually mined the block that included the transaction.  
I'm not sure but that may not even require multisig, just shared private keys (sounds crazy but bear with me).  For example the miners could include a consolidating transaction that pays from the "shared" key to their own private address.  If they in fact mine the block they get the fees and the funds are swept to a safe address.  The shared key never holds funds, only intra-block.
These concepts are at the limits of my current understanding.  Perhaps someone with a greater understanding could comment more authoritatively about these ideas.

Single solution fallacy.  There is room in the marketplace for more than one "currency" as we see today with hundreds around the world, precious metals, commodities and collectibles.  ETH can succeed and not displace Bitcoin but rather complement it.  Think of them as different financial instruments depending on the requirements.  ETH also has a long way to go to prove it's worthy of the top spot.  Btw, there are now at least 10s of very popular programming languages (think frameworks too - hundreds) all used for essentially the same purpose.  This is a very good analog.

@_date: 2017-08-06 18:44:05


Your analogy is only accurate if you see the LN deposit as something significantly different than funds in your wallet.  Locked funds are you funds in a channel that you control and that you can recall at any time.  All of this could be hidden and performed by the wallet without you even knowing it.  Wallets could be programmed to notice common paths, lump transactions together and then when you need access to funds that are locked (run out of unlocked funds), to automatically unlock them.  What I learned from the early blocksize debate is we should think first of the end user feature and focus less on the implementation details.  They are important, but we should start with the end user feature to avoid getting lost in the weeds right off the bat.


You may have a point here, but we have a similar risk today.  For example regulators could mandate that in order for large retailers to legally accept bitcoin they have to use Coinbase and other KYC exchanges/merchant providers.  I hate even writing that as it gives me chills to think about (don't want to give them any ideas).  That all being said there is a $10B global "black market" (cash market) that will only grow as decentralization and the ad-hoc economy grows.  With privacy there will be nothing regulators can do to stop person to person exchange which is what Bitcoin was created for.

What wallet?  Seems like a question for the author of that software.


Falkvinge's transaction was very rare and occupied the blockspace of 100 average transactions.  He also over estimated fees (since his wallet didn't know how to do it and neither did he) and paid something like $10 for the fee.
1st - I assume your transaction had less than $10 in fees, so his was much more atypical than yours.
2nd - if you don't know how to estimate fees, perhaps choose a wallet that does, learn how to do it yourself, don't use bitcoin during a spam attack, or wait until the network improves scale via LN or other methods being discussed.  You're essentially complaining that it takes an hour to download a game in 1994.  That didn't make the internet broken, it was just premature.

I find it interesting that you've apparently made the assumption that all Trump supporters are supportive of past administrations' foreign interventions.  It's especially strange when you see that Trump did not support the Iraq war despite the war machine being in full Propaganda mode at the time.  Leftist media has slandered Trump with the only shred of information they have that shows anything but criticism of the Iraq war, being him passively saying "I guess" when asked by Howard Stern shock-jock (not known for his high quality political insights) a leading question about it.  It was not "Face the Nation".  You'll not find another clip of him expressing any support of the war.  If you do please send it to me.  
If anything, people supporting Trump are fed up with the 2 party system and have realized that they are both statist.  They are both war-mongering.  Obama's gets a Nobel peace prize and then an unprecedented 8 straight years of war?  This included toppling Libya and going after Syria?  For what reason?  Trump was not a Democrat and not really a Republican.  Most of the reason I started to take him seriously was because establish Republicans didn't like him.  If we have any chance of peeling back the curtain, he is it.
Trump has reduced our involvement in Syria and is open to de-escalation with Russia.  You must see that this is indicating moves in the right direction, no?
Trump has appointed anti-big-government heads to multiple important departments, is actively working to reduce federal power and has consistently stated his desires to do so.  What do you think "Drain the swamp" is referring to?  It's not Republican rhetoric, it's a rejection of the ever growing federal power grab that has led to much of the international interference you are complaining about.  The craziness in the media is clearly a result of the deep state (the war machine) finding Trump incompatible with them.  The media is no help as they were colluding through the 8 years of Obama's war machine, dropping hundreds of thousands of bombs on the same Countries that they were later complaining Trump wanted to do extreme vetting on.  Reconcile that.
You seem to be blaming the ills of past administrations on the one guy that can actually be seen taking steps to cure those ailments, and on the people who support him who are hoping he does.
The craziest part is that I'm imagining that you think Trump is worse than Clinton, when she was part of the reason we were in Libya and Syria (among others) and was heating up Russian conflict.  So with those 2 options what would you do?
Do you think Merkel in Germany is taking in immigrants out of the goodness of her heart despite the increase in crime?  It's a leftist plot to change the demographics of the populous.

You just set parameters within which you're comfortable to have the wallet make the decision.  It chooses the cheapest method.  I don't see the problem but maybe if you get more specific I'll be able to see your point.
Regarding the money transmitter laws, I'm no expert in this field but it seems like a distinction without a practical difference.  For both methods it could be argued that it's "the network protocol" moving the funds, not "the guy running the node".  I would imagine electronic contracts will have to deal with similar issues.  Again, I may be missing something but my intuition is telling me this is a non-issue.

You aren't considering the fact that satellite is multicast.  One upstream transmission to the satellite broadcasts to anyone in line of sight.
This is a brilliant complement to help with some of the problems posed by Bitcoin's massive redundancy.
It doesn't completely solve the problem as for broadcasting transactions (individual transactions) satellites cost more per byte and introduce more latency, but this is a huge positive step.

I'm confused, did the Nazi's invent bratwurst?
Did America invent slavery or were they the first to abolish it (at great cost)?
Regardless, in this particular case, not only did Core invent, develop and test SegWit, they've had to fight an onslaught of uninformed and potentially ill intentioned parties to bring it to reality.  AND, it's the only option that is backwards compatible, not forcing massive timed upgrades.  So the specifics make it significantly different, especially than your examples - granted there are probably better examples than you chose off the top of your head.  It's hard for me to imagine how under these specific circumstances you can like the tech, but not respect and appreciate the folks that have gone to great lengths to bring it to us.  Apparently you have to also somehow reconcile believing in the tech while also believing the propaganda from the parties fighting against it.  That's what I find hard to understand.

Look into the difference between closed secured (replicated) databases and a public blockchain.  They have different qualities and constraints.  


You are seemingly assuming that since CC can scale (more on that later), that a blockchain can easily scale the same way.  Regarding CC scale, if you think that was simple a matter of changing a constant somewhere, you're wrong.  It took decades and likely at least tens of billions in investment in infrastructure and R&amp;D over that time to achieve what CCs have today.

It's great that you're focusing only on the operation of the pipeline itself and not the jobs created by the new flow of North American oil to American refineries.  It shows you love to eat propaganda and make invalid arguments.  You also of course fail to mention any strategic benefits or economic benefits.  Pretending to be objective and utterly failing.


Pulling billions of US taxpayer dollars destined for other more polluting nations is  progress, especially when we are making the same environmental progress without having to spend that money.  Try making an argument about how it would be a bigger win somehow by continuing to give away those billions.

Maybe you can explain to me how you are not being bigoted when you group all of us together based on who we voted for without considering the many different variables and reasons that go into such a decision?


How about the 80's under Reagan.  You did know that was his slogan, right?


Have you been to one?  This is another bigoted remark and I'm guessing it's not based on 1st hand experience.


Why is it not your shame?  You live in Australia.  Why is it my shame for things that happened before my lifetime, but you get a pass?  It's based on your decedents, is it?  That would seem to indicate that you're making a judgement based on heritage and not the content of an individual's character. I'm not sure but that seems racist.  
Perhaps the immigration islands are working to keep terrorism out and to protect the nation's interests?  Do you live with the indigenous people?  Are you not taking advantage of the advancements that colonization and modernization brought?  Wait, is Satoshi Nakamoto an indigenous Australian?  Clearly Tim Berners-Lee was not.
Do you know that in North America, before the devastation the colonists wreaked on Native Americans that there was peace across the land.  Yeah, no, there wasn't.  There were many peoples that lived in and fought over territory in North America.  Conquest has been in our human DNA from our beginnings.  Perhaps we should do DNA test to figure out who owe's who what based on ancient wars, even if it's only an apology.  Sound thinking.


That must have been really hard to do.  In no way could that have been a politically motivated act.


Who should we be apologizing to?  The Native Americans?  For deeds done 400 years ago?  There have been reparations and accommodations.  Our country was born at a time of worldwide slavery, was enlightened by our own philosophy and fought each other to overcome that abhorrent concept at a cost of 600,000+ American men.  You know there are still places on this earth with slaves and slave trade right?  Perhaps your energies would be best focused on that instead of blaming distant descendants for ancient travesties that we didn't personally commit.  I'm also really curious how you think those debts could ever be repaid or is this an eternal injustice to e passed down through the ages?  Seems you are asserting it already is.  How many generations until our bloodline is clean?
You know what I think?  I think you're a dirty leftist bent on anti-capitalist destruction of the Western world.  You're competing in the oppression Olympics and trying to use your heritage as some sort of crutch and tool against capitalism and individualism.  Then again I know nothing about you so I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you have your reasons for thinking the way you do and writing what could easily be characterized a bigoted remarks.

I think you may be hung up on what "held accountable" means.  I personally haven't heard anyone speak with such an authoritative manner about bitcoin compared to Mark T. Williams, Professor Bitcorn.
Question, did you actually watch and listen to his testimony?  If you had you might see why people are ridiculing him here.
All predictions I've heard about bitcoin by advocates seem to speak about what MAY be possible and have broad time horizons.  Bitcoin's impact on banking and governments are most likely many years out in the future - if they happen at all.  The prediction by Williams was specific in both price and time frame.  It was also somewhat insulting to the whole community.
By the way, on the front page there's a link to an article on whitehouse.gov.  If that's not an indication that crypto-currencies, bitcoin being the first mover, are having an impact on governments I don't know what is.  So you may want to prepare your world view for that.

What ideology would you suggest the Trumpian philosophy mostly aligns with?  Before you answer perhaps you were unaware of the following:
What Republican or Democrat would be doing this? 
He put a critic of the EPA in the top position at the EPA, a critic at the top of the Department of Education, was looking at Balaji Srinivasan for FDA, had Peter Thiel as an advisor.  He deescalated tensions in Syria (started by Obama and I'm sure desired by globalist big oil and neocons).  He's got [Rick Perry talking about the problems with a large federal government and a need for moving more power to the states]( - really great btw, you should watch the whole thing if you haven't.
Funny how when trying to argue against Trump you brought literally no data specific to Trump.  Rand Paul is great, but he and his dad could never quite make it.  Trump has overcome the beast by using the Republican party (very similarly to how Reagan did) and appealing to the public.  He'll have to do for now until we get an electable Libertarian.

I'm hoping the IRS scandal eventually gets opened up and perhaps the nature of that beast gets tamed.  We'll see if he can ever get to his tax plan.
Ron and Rand are clearly more on board and I'd prefer either of them in office, but they've so far lacked the skill to overpower the propagandist media like Trump has.

Just realize if you export your private keys to sell a fork-coin, the keys from the post Aug 1 coins will not contain fork-coin balances.
Also, never delete wallets or keys (more directly, make sure you have adequate backups).  While they may not contain balances for BTC (if you moved them) they can still unlock fork-coins.  I don't know under what circumstances Electrum merges coins from separate keys, but it seems like there may be scenarios where it will do this without letting you know.  In other words, it seems possible (maybe not likely) that pre-fork coins could move to a BTC only (post fork) address without you explicitly forcing it to happen.  I mention it because you might make the assumption that "empty" keys are empty on all chains and that assumption **may** not be safe.

You implied strongly people that believe in a god are idiots.  Perhaps it's apparent (or desired) to them that there must be some larger explanation for our existence.  If you weren't religious about your hate of religion (it's obvious), then you might realize that it's actually a positive thing.  Many humans choose to fill those gaps you spoke of with a hope/faith/belief that there is a higher purpose, in many cases because they've either seen things that otherwise have little explanation (self sacrifice - soldier jumping on a grenade for his brothers), or so horrible that they want to believe it was for a reason.  These may simply be stories people tell themselves, but unless and until there is proof there is no higher power, I choose to allow for that possibility.  Btw, without that faith there would be one less check against the ugly underbelly of humanity.  If nothing means anything then why shouldn't you kill your neighbors?  Why shouldn't tyrants exterminate millions of people like we do ants?
All of this is beside the point that folks like you get some sort of thrill from creating a stir against people who choose to fill those gaps with something instead of nothing. You're clearly a closed minded person and my guess is also a sad person.

I had a generally negative outlook about the longer term future. Then I realized that not only are there people actively discussing ideas about how to fight back against tyranny, but there are people actually executing on those ideas.  With every day that passes we can now see that the technologies they spawned actually stand a fighting chance to upend these corrupt systems.
I also get a huge kick out of seeing disruption via decentralization impacting other areas, like social media upending the incumbent media, YouTube the big networks, Uber/Lyft disrupting the cab cartel, AirBnB with accommodations, and I look forward to the 2nd phase disruptions of each where individuals disrupt the disruptors (who are still centralized), and likely utilizing cryptocurrencies to do it.
All of these movements share a common theme of power to the people and they can work together and build on one another.
I see the future as headed in an incredibly positive direction now.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that you are right and it's not that I just don't have a few hours to dig it all up to satisfy your request.  Let's assume this is a true statement:


If the numbers don't exist then *how do you know* that the network can safely support 2x, 3x, 4x etc?
What we should agree on is that increasing network requirements increases the cost of running nodes.  We should probably also agree that what sets bitcoin apart from it's predecessors is that it's permissionless because it's decentralized.  If we have a choice between scaling via a method that increases node cost vs. that optimizes node resources, IMO we should choose the latter.


Those help with time to transmit/receive blocks, not verify.  Please correct me if I'm mistaken.
Regarding scale, lets imagine an early internet, say on 10-base-2 with one wire, everyone on the same network, all traffic passing through every node.  To upgrade that network 2x you'd have to upgrade every network card and since there is are no private LANs the total scale of the network can only reach 1:1 with the capacity of the pipe.
Now lets imagine the internet with all different types of network cards for different purposes, different network paths, with packet switching, routers, NAT/LANs.  The total scale of that network is not limited by the smallest pipe and in fact could be many magnitudes times the minimum node capacity depending on the number of nodes and their topology.  It offers better privacy since private LANs can be created among parties where traffic doesn't leak to the rest of the network, and because other traffic only follows a single path between recipients and not to every single node on the network.
The first scenario is comparable to scale via increasing the block size.  The second is comparable to SegWit+L2.
Let's stop wasting time discussing primitive scaling solutions like a block size increase. 
Also, there's now an alternative so maybe you should just put your money where your mouth is and just use it.

Straw man - arguing against a point by changing the central premise of your adversary.




The point was that science does not completely explain existence.  Beyond that the larger argument was that if you cannot explain existence they you have no basis to be claiming religion (creationism) is bullshit.
You have had to change the argument to essentially "while science cannot adequately explain everything, like how we all got here, it did give us the internet."  That is a straw man argument.

You make an interesting point, but remember that the internet was around for decades being developed and used by "tech people" long before mass adoption.  I think Bitcoin will be the same.  I believe we are at the inflection point now (like 1996) with regular steady growth and more waves coming in because of the undeniably compelling price moves.  Now that it's in the news again without all the smug remarks and smirks the news can't stop covering it.  It's only going up from here.  
As for November, I can't predict what will happen then, but other than that the prospects seem huge.

Remember that with satellite you can multicast.  This means that the upstream connection to the satellite simply sends the block once (or maybe repeats recent blocks at intervals for newer listeners) but that single signal can be received by as many devices as are within line of sight (potentially millions or more).  
Transmission of block data this way is very efficient and arguably relatively inexpensive.

Seems like we're mostly in agreement after all this.
I've never suggested or thought that there will never be a time when a blocksize increase may be desired/necessary, I'm suggesting that we exhaust as many options not requiring a hard fork as possible before then.  Similar to how we've upgraded the internet over time, not forced everyone to upgrade all at once.  We should also expect that upstream bandwidth and CPU power will continue to increase (and decrease in price) as hopefully will decentralization of mining, perhaps by diversification of ASIC production.


Higher expense is also correlated with greater security, so I don't think you can assume less participation naturally derives from the higher expense.  We may see a point in the future where some of the other coins, including perhaps yesterday's fork, are tested, at which point that will be more clear.

@_date: 2017-08-10 04:28:05


Please specifically point out the fallacy you're asserting I used.


Straw-man.  I never suggested I could prove existence of a god, nor is existence of a god needed to make any part of the argument I've been making.  Here are the words I used:
"it makes no sense to rule out a creator"
The implication, if you somehow missed it, is that you cannot prove otherwise.  Moreover, there is so little known about the origin of existence that it seems absurd to even try to make odds yet you apparently believe the odds are 100% in favor of no creator.   The logical fallacy you present it to suggest that since there "literally no scientific reason to [believe in a flying sky daddy]" that it must be false.  Another fallacy.  Lack of evidence does not equate to not lack of existence.  Interestingly there is no scientific evidence to suggest there is NOT a creator.  Before you try to go there, I addressed the literal inconsistencies with specific religious texts in my very first post here "You can call out the literal details for being impossible".
I'm open minded, as would be anyone that respects scientific method, to their being no god, to us finding a purely scientific provable explanation for the origin of the universe/multiverse and whatever extends beyond.  The thing is, I don't have the burden of proof.  You, on the other hand are suggesting it's idiotic to be open to a creator, so you do have the burden of proof AND it's common knowledge that you don't have the data to do it.  We may never have the data to do it, it may in fact be unknowable.  Like a 2 dimensional man would not be able to fathom a 3 dimensional world, or a computer simulation might never "understand" the system it's running on or even have the capacity to know who, what or why it was created.  This is why your position is untenable.
The irony is that people like you are the exact opposite of what you think you are.  You think you believe in the scientific method when in fact you just believe a different religion.  A religion that insists there is no possible way there is a creator and that somehow everything just burst into existence from nothing.  And you believe all of it on faith.

Hmm, that's a really interesting comment.  Didn't you just assert Obama saw a 22% rise in the S&amp;P in his 1st 6 months in office?  Wouldn't that be GWB's economic policy by your own definition?  And then wouldn't that also mean that we are still on Obama's economic policy now?  I can't wait to see how you rationalize your way out of that one.  "I found one!"

You didn't mention anything about a time constraint in this statement.  Perhaps next time you make such a statement you should add a time qualifier.
It will happen faster than you think because of the fees.  I predict within months, not "a year atleast".  I also predict BCH will taper further from parity with Bitcoin proper over time since it must develop it's own merchant adoption, like a brand new alt, and unlike Litecoin and others, it has significant barriers to getting LN and allowing cross chain atomic swaps.

Let's see, have you considered any other metrics besides your reported 32 jobs?  How about less imports from the ME or tax revenue generation?  Seems like a pretty slim view to only look at one metric.  I'm also pretty sure that it's more than 32 permanent jobs.


How tolerant, and wise.


Bringing up the TPP, Paris climate change deal and objecting to the pipeline are pretty good indicators that you might be more liberal than you realize.

Kudos on your 2A support.  You'll get nothing but praise from me for that.  Though supporting globalism via the TPP seems inconsistent.  Part of the reason we need the guns is to fend of the slippery slope of the leftists' creeping centralization of power.
Edit: 


It seems most "news" is editorial these days, or had you not noticed the sea change in the mainstream coverage between the last president and the current.  If you can't notice the difference then you're not thinking critically.  I would be alarmed were the roles reversed.  The media was a tool of the state for 8 years covering for Obama and Hillary's unprecedented scandals and now has spent 6 months on a witch hunt.  Trump was wiretapped, then he wasn't, Trump colluded with Russia, then he didn't, then he did again.  The media is a laughing stock right now and is accelerating their own demise by decentralized platforms and independent investigative journalism.  This is totally consistent with the disruption Bitcoin brings to financial incumbents like the Fed, banks and governments.  Mark my words, in 10 years the landscape will be much different in both areas.  You use bitcoin presumably because you see the value of moving power from incumbent untrustworthy 3rd parties yet you fawn over a media controlled by a handful of crooked incumbents in the same corrupt elite echelon, as if they have your best interests at heart.  You're deluded.

I see what you mean.
I think this is an area that might need more focus.  Even regular bitcoin nodes could be argued (again it makes me uncomfortable even writing this) "move value" or facilitate the movement.  It would be smart to imagine how the regulatory aspects and interpretations might play out, to see if there's a way to make the code do things in ways that minimize that characterization to help future legal battles.
Another interesting related topic is framing.  I listened to an interview a while ago from one of the creators of Skype (pre MS centralization) and he said that they skirted telecom regulation simply with framing.  They never referred to the product as a "phone" product.  By the time regulators could react the landscape had changed due to the disruption.
I'm wondering if there is not wisdom in focusing on person to person use for that very reason.  I remember reading a post by a person who was adamant that creating fiat-bitcoin exchanges would mean the death of bitcoin.  I'm seeing the wisdom of his point over time.
I don't think we'd see regulators involvement to the degree we do if we were trading Bitcoins for WOW Gold and other digital intangibles. Then again, we likely wouldn't see the investment we've seen either.

Until we truly understand the origins of life and the universe (beyond the "big bang") it makes no sense to rule out a creator.  You can call out the literal details for being impossible, but the fact of the matter is that nobody knows.  For all we know we are simulations running on a fantastic computer with resources planted around our virtual world to throw us off.
True scientists don't pretend anything is fact until they can prove it.  There is no necessary divide between people of science and those that believe in a creator.
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:04:34


"They believe in bullshit"
You've made a bigoted statement lumping whoever "they" are all together and you've assumed "they" all believe the same things, rather than just being open to the unknown, since none of theories are proven or complete (what was "here" before the big bang?), and then you are making the objective assessment that what "they" believe is bullshit while what you believe is science.  
Fact: Evolution is a theory, the big bang is a theory, both are also possible and consistent with a "creator" who perhaps may have created the universe.  Very smart people, [Elon Musk for example]( has stated that he thinks the odds are that we are not living in "base reality" and more likely living in a simulation.  Now who's theory would that matche better?  Actually smart people, who respect the scientific method understand the difference between theory and fact, and that a "consensus" can be wrong.  Our greatest discoveries ran in opposition to the "conventional wisdom".  See Galileo.
If you'd like to get into more detail, please explain where all matter comes from or what happened before the big bang.


Are you and Al Gore denier?
He was the most vocal proponent of AGW and most if not all of his predictions from just 10 short years ago were wrong.  So you can claim the science is with you but science generally results in accurate predictions +/- a small deviation. Perhaps you'd like to forget about him, but the fact of the matter is that the AGW crowd was even more vocal back then.
To stick with the AGW diatribe despite those predictions not working out is to be on the anti-science side.  You've got it completely backwards.  But feel free to worship whatever religions you'd like.  It's a free country.

Absolutely AJ. I wasn't going back that far. :)  If only WW hadn't given away the ranch in 1913, the Fed and the IRS.  What a nightmare that began.
I'm glad you appreciated the Perry conference.  I was taught that states' rights were important as they were intended to compete as different experiments in government and people could simply vote with their feet.  We've had so much federal power grabbed and "one size fits all" as Perry put it that it is much less effective to move.  There is also a ton more conflict than there needs to be.  Let the left coast experiment with their leftist craziness, let Texas go to the other extreme.  If you don't like it move to a state where you like their laws and customs, you've got 50 to choose from.  If their experiments are not economically viable or are unfriendly they will have to make corrections as they are competing for residents just like companies compete for customers.  It's brilliant.  Big federal government has destroyed the effectiveness of that important concept. 
I've always been interested in the Free State Project.  It shares those same ideas and is a big step in the right direction but unfortunately you'd still be subject to the oppression and long arms of the federal government.  At least it's a starting point.
Regarding Ron and Rand I wholeheartedly agree.  I saw (this video)( a few years ago and saw that even Fox was in on the game.  After that I realized that until the media was disrupted by the internet we'd never see a Libertarian president, though Reagan considered himself a Libertarian and effectively co-opted the Republican party to get elected.
Then along comes Trump and he accelerates the disruption of the media by the internet.  Unfortunately he's not a declared Libertarian and clearly doesn't have a well articulated and formalized political ideology, more of a hip shooter, but he does seem to weigh in more on the small government, limited international intervention side of things than typical modern day Republicans.  I see him cozying up with Rand Paul and I'm hoping all the OCare gyrations are all just a chess game to ultimately get through Rand's plan.  Let people suffer ObamaCare for a while so the Democrats feel the backlash and then put through a plan that works best for the working people that is consistent with individual rights and liberty.  
My experiences here in what should be a Libertarian bastion have so far been mixed, so I worry that without informed freedom loving people the state may ultimately win.  Thankfully there's a few like you.

Though I understand your response, you're misinterpreting my statement.  UDP is not a different version of TCP/IP.  Try to modify the TCP packet structure (not use a different well supported alternative, UDP) and send packets from an existing endpoint in New York to one in Sydney.  The network will not recognize it and will reject it.  
The IP part has been on a migration from v4 to v6 for 20 years.
From: 
"Despite how well IPv4 has served us, it was recognized that for various reasons a new version of IP would eventually be required. **Due to the difficulties associated with making such an important change**, development of this new version of IP has actually been underway since the mid-1990s."
A hard fork is equivalent to forcing all internet users to upgrade away from v4 to v6 on a certain date.  Notice, that is not the way it is being done with IP for very good reason yet for some reason when it comes to Bitcoin, some people fail to see the problem with that approach.

This is inaccurate information and should be removed immediately.  It's a confusing process so it's understandable why you got it wrong.

You don't pay for each transactions, just opening and closing transactions.
Moving many of the smaller transactions to LN will reduce on-chain usage.  Also, over LN channels potentially thousands/tens of thousands of transactions can be made, so divide your $5x2=$10 by some factor, say even 100 and you can see that the price per transaction can be reduced significantly.

If I'm not mistaken, currently each block is essentially transmitted twice.  The transaction is announced and then again as part of a block.  I'm also not sure your other math is correct and it does not seem to account for bursts being simply an average over a month.
You also have not accounted for the fact that people also need to use their upstream (generally speaking) for other uses.
Country averages don't take everything into account as there can be wide variability that averages out.  That said, it's understood that we don't need bitcoin nodes absolutely everywhere, just in a diversity of locations around the globe.  Preferably a number in every country.
Cities in Australia, namely Brisbane for one, at least until very recently, surprisingly had metered bandwidth and caps.  I'm sure they are not alone.
You also failed to address orphaned blocks.  What I've read leads me to believe that combining the great firewall of China, Chinese miner dominance and increased block size can lead to an unfair lead for Chinese miners creating more mining centralization and more orphan blocks for those on this side of the firewall.
Let's focus on real scale thoughtfully.  Changing a constant is a primitive and short sighted measure.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:48:02
No, regular nodes.  That said I prefer your description of what nodes do, should it ever need to be characterized in a court, but I think it could be argued that each node facilitates the transfer.  Maybe laws surrounding the internet make that unlikely, which would be great, since internet nodes can't (at this point) be expected to filter every packet that passes through them, but I still worry.  I wonder if this isn't a great argument for why all of the data should be encrypted.  Then there would not only be no argument, there'd be no possibility.


In light of that, why do you think that LN nodes would be looked at any differently than miners?  They both move coins from account to account and they both get paid to do it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:57:23
If you use a pool, yes, semi-regular payouts.  Just be prepared that the payout will need to exceed the fee, so the pool will likely have payout thresholds, so you may have to wait a while between payments.  For some pools, under some circumstances, if you only mine for a short clip, you will basically be donating to the pool.  We're talking chump change though.  Every little bit helps.

2. why it's OK to make running a full node near impossible in many countries where it's currently possibly, 
3. how larger blocks will impact running a full node over tor,

My rhetorically asking for a scientific explanation for where matter comes from was to highlight that there is no proven explanation for our existence to make the point that any suggestion that you can **prove** there is no god/creator if patently false.  You took it as me suggesting it was proof, which was not at all my assertion.
Q: "What created matter?", A: "We don't know, but we do know it definitely was not a creator, because science."
Because your comprehension skills are lacking, let me make it clear, **entertaining the possibility of something is distinct and different from suggesting something is true and provable**.  The only one making any assertion of proof is you, without the data to back it.


Ah, the words of a Scientist.  I've not argued on behalf of specific religious texts.  I've argued from the very start (look at the original comment) that there is no reason to rule out a creator.
So you believe in the "possibility" of extraterrestrial life but you have no actual evidence?  It seems like in certain circumstances you allow your "scientific" (not scientific) brain to believe in the "possibility" of something without actual evidence, but for some reason that "logic" changes when you zoom out and have to entertain possible answers to what created the system itself.  Science is not inconsistent like that.


As for what you think the chances are, I don't care in the slightest.  As for what could explain it, I already mentioned one possibility.  We may be programs running in some simulation.  In fact Elon Musk for example seems convinced that we are very likely not experiencing base reality and more likely to be a simulation of sorts.  In that scenario, all bets are off.  In fact the possibility that this could even be a possibility should help you see how little we know (as in can prove) about the origins of our own existance.  I'm not suggesting that since we know so little there "must be" anything, except open minds.  Disagree if you like, but realize that your disagreement is not scientific, it's emotional.

Also, if you look at the 2 halvings, the reward per block is still greater in fiat terms than it was historically even when the reward per block was 50 or 25 bitcoins.  That said, that doesn't consider the additional costs of mining due to the increase in difficulty.  As the pricing dynamics of mining change, this can impact price, though it is a complex set of variables.  If for some reason in the future the reward+fees didn't translate into profit for miners, those miners would shut down/turn off their rigs.  This would continue until either the difficulty readjusts making mining profitable for remaining miners, or until the price moved (due to adoption etc.) making it profitable again.  
We see the same thing with gold as mines are regularly shut down and reopened based on the price or on increased productivity of mining equipment/processes.

I'll read it when I have a chance.


The concern is spam attacks so they'd be full.  Larger blocks means spam attacks are more expensive for nodes.  At least miners are getting paid for the spam one way or another.


That's one issue and verification time is another issue.  Larger blocks take longer to verify.  IIRC there are ways to construct transactions that take very long to verify.  Larger blocks means that more of these types of transactions can be shoved into a single block giving the block creator a head start on his competitors.


Nope, I'm saying we shouldn't think that a good scalability plan is to keep adding more or bigger wires.  You don't double copper and get fiber as a result.

I think this case, as well as another I saw on bring into question their business practices and policies.  I'll be discontinuing use until I get some sort of response from them regarding their policy to simply disable accounts with no explanation and confiscating their user's bitcoin.
The user's story seems credible and he has provided email correspondence from Purse.IO.  I think it's a big mistake for Purse.IO to ignore our requests for detail in this matter.
Original post below:
I've used them many times and often see "earners" with a very high number of successful "earns".  Their support is also very good (although email/chat only) the very few times I had issues (earner asked for early delivery confirmation, item never arrived, item became unavailable on Amazon or price changed).
Your statements also imply you've been involved in multiple negative transactions:
"They will disable your account."
"Buyers that don´t pay you is at least 50% of the time."
"And they dont punish these buyers so they continue trying to steal your bitcoins."
Somehow I find it hard to believe that after even one or two bad experiences you'd go back for a third.  If your data set is only 1 or 2 experiences, it doesn't line up with the claims you are making, so I'm left wondering if you're exaggerating.

I'm definitely one of those, but I get your point.  I suppose it has a better chance than a pure alt since it shares the same base chain (I'm using the nicer description).  That said it has to start all over in terms of garnering adoption.  Maybe you'll get big service providers to convert and bring their retailers with them.  I suppose that's a definite possibility.
What will be the real test is if someone attacks it with large long to validate blocks.  That won't kick in until the difficulty adjustment.  Hold onto your hats then.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:35:41
Upstream bandwidth is also important, not for your node specifically, but enough people must also contribute to sharing transaction and block data for the network to function.  Ideally these would be regionally diverse and even 1st world nations like Australia still have very expensive upstream bandwidth costs even today.
Assuming exponential increases too keep up with growth is not a safe bet.
Better to keep the network requirements as low as possible with L2 scaling solutions and only increase the requirements if/when those are exhausted, which may be never.  LN and other L2 tech can not only increase transaction throughput exponentially using the same underlying L1 resources, it will enable other important innovations such as transaction privacy.

Best way to see this is for yourself so you can better understand the costs of running the infrastructure of the Bitcoin network.

Have you considered that perhaps your points weren't clear?  You switched to numbered bullets from quotes.


You did say it, but not "JUST", many post back.  Forgive me for losing your train of thought.
Fair point re: Trump's metrics, that said he's named plenty of metrics that are true, unemployment, GDP growth, job growth.  He also classically over uses superlatives.  This has been robust growth, perhaps not "the best".  It's his shtick.  He "uses the best words".  It may be a New York thing. There will always be spin and politicking.  Obama for example was blaming Bush well into his first term and for part of his second.
There's plenty of issues to hit politicians on. Obama told us we didn't build our own businesses, Hillary blamed the racist, sexist misogynists and thought we should vote for her based on her gender.  People dog pile on Trump but he seems to be the best bet Libertarians have had for probably 100 years, aside from Reagan.  Yes, Ron or Rand would be better, but they haven't made it yet.

I always had a feeling there was more to the small blocker position (which I hold as well) that had to remain unspoken.  Perhaps this was it.  One should be able to see how an ambitious project like this would need to be kept under wraps when trying to disrupt the many interests involved in the currency issuance and banking business.  
I may be wrong in my assessment but we may find out that bloating the network could have impacted this project in a negative way.  I can also see how putting the blockchain in space would be a very important hurdle to ensure the security of the network that would outweigh other factors in the shorter term.
I also could be connecting dots incorrectly.
My guess is that the satellite(s) will transmit at least blocks.  This would allow otherwise disconnected nodes to operate and verify payments independent of a firewalled/censored internet connection.  Ideally being able to broadcast transactions to the network, via the existing Bitcoin network and LN/L2 would be desired, but my guess is that would not be included in the v1 of this tech as 2 way satellite requires more expensive client hardware.  Also, an individual can more easily broadcast their own transactions over existing connectivity but might find it harder to receive blocks over thin connections.
This is all just speculation.
Exciting times!

I wasn't aware compact blocks was already deployed.  Point conceded.


It matters if it impacts your overall upstream for other activities.


You're making assumptions about people's bandwidth availability again.  If someone has low upstream and needs it for skype for work for example, they'd be in conflict.


I used the 1st world to highlight my point that even in the 1st world there are places with low bandwidth, caps and metered internet.  The goal is not to only have nodes in the 1st world.


You seem to be making an argument that since latency is a smaller factor it's not important. All these aspects are important.  This one concerns node centralization and has an effect on mining centralization.  Maybe it's less important relatively to the other issues with respect to the mining centralization issue, but not unimportant.


How are you measuring that?  Links?
SegWit also seems to enable important features by solving the malleability problem. This enables 2nd later solutions like LN which will bring more scale.  You argument seems equivalent to suggesting a checksum would work against scale.  I hope you can see that's a bad argument.

I don't think you can so easily generalize about why people like gold.  It also seems very odd to suggest that people like it based on it being the opposite of something that was invented in 2009, since gold predates bitcoin by centuries.

I use something similar relating bitcoin without LN equivalent to a 10base2 network  with all computers connected by one cable, terminated on each end, where all traffic is sent to all parties and the maximum throughput is the same for everyone.  To increase the number of transactions on the network, everyone's network card must be upgraded and there is no privacy (not sure if that was true of a real 10base2, but I think so.
Bitcoin+SW+LN (L2) is like the internet we have now, with routers, NAT, different specs for all nodes, yet the network is not limited by the minimum hardware and upgrades can be performed piecemeal.  Massive traffic can be circulated privately while never hitting the main network and only traffic that has to route outside of those smaller sub-nets has to span separate networks.
There is no contest.   is the proper way to scale and as a bonus it offers more transaction privacy on the immutable chin.

Paul, that is the only email ever sent to you?
If so, that does seem a bit brief and should probably provide more of an explanation, especially as to why they will not release your bitcoin.  I could imagine reasons that they may not be explicit, for example if the bitcoin were tainted, though that would have been on the spender's side, or perhaps if you had sent them to a known blacklisted address (I don't support this practice by any means), but at the very least they could have made some generic statement like:
"There was a problem that was flagged by our compliance department and we unfortunately cannot release your bitcoin."
"You've violated our terms of service, see the xyz section for more information."
I'm not sure if those would be any more helpful, but they'd certainly seem like a more legitimate response.  To simply say "We will not reinstate your account." is unsettling as a long time Purse customer.  I'd hate to imagine that my discounts are coming at the expense of "earners" getting their bitcoin confiscated without explanation.
I really think you need to consider clarifying what's happened in this situation.  I've been a vocal defender and without a reasonable explanation will certainly not continue to defend it.

That's not how you efficiently scale.

I took that as a given, but your clarification is likely important for folks unfamiliar with satellite technology.
I'm already digging through the documentation.  I'd love to have an "offline" wallet connected this way.  So there will be at least 1 receiver :).
I also appreciate how this, to an extent, helps complement and compensate for bitcoin's massive redundancy.  Over terrestrial networks the collective costs of that redundancy is high while over satellite it's not.  Both forms can now work together to fortify the security of the network and maybe at some point even help improve scale.  Many details to consider and iron out, but this is a very exciting development.

Did you miss the discussion where core developers explained why they didn't want to raise the block size?  There are multiple reasons, so this is not the sole reason, but one of the main political drivers was that once the blocksize stop-gap increase was used as an answer to scalability, there would be not incentive to work on actual scalability solutions.  The can would be clicked down the road far enough that the network would develop and get more entrenched, making real scale solutions harder over time, and eliminating the urgency in the shorter term.
There is of course also precedent of a hard fork, that could be used by governments to manage  changes for regulation, problems with mining centralization related to higher orphan rates for larger blocks, whole countries full of people that lacked adequate  bandwidth  to run their own nodes etc.
You probably knew all this though and just fancy yourself smarter than the folks that have been maintaining and substantially improving the network for years.

"A further subset of people – I am still not going to name or imply an affiliation because Chatham House rules – insist on the **importance of not taking risks** with the bitcoin network.

We’ve seen a capacity ceiling approach for two years, and now we’ve hit it – how can you talk about **not taking risks** at the same time as you completely ignore the approaching and completely predictable capacity wall for several years?"
Risking decentralization is different than the "risk" associated with waiting for scale.
This guy has value to add but his arguments are very primitive.  I'm not sure why he was even invited.

Yet powerful industry players and governments cannot stop BitTorrent.  You have no basis for your assertion while I do for mine.


How is gold somehow not susceptible to whatever you think Bitcoin is susceptible to?  Gold's physical nature makes it in some ways more vulnerable than Bitcoin and there is precedent for confiscation and use being made illegal AND people complying.

The brilliance of the Xapo, BitPay, Shift (Coinbase) debit cards is that you can already spend "bitcoin" essentially anywhere.  When I use mine I tell the retailer I am using Bitcoin indirectly and that some day they may be able to use it to avoid credit card fees and charge-backs.
These cards have essentially solved the bootstrapping problem without forcing a different process that employees need to be trained to perform.  The "how do I spend it/who accepts it" problem being solved can only help adoption.  When enough people get behind the curtain they can choose to accept bitcoin directly which hopefully soon will be a simpler process with better capacity (SW/LN).  Then comes the real bitcoin economy.

I found Gavin to be almost a bit too care free. There is a seriousness about bitcoin that many may not realize.  It's potentially a world changing innovation with many people, companies and even industries that may be disrupted by it.   Decisions cannot be made lightly.
Also, if my memory serves, Gavin was pushed out after supporting XT and suggesting moving the block-size limit to 20MB, or it might have been after he "confirmed" that Craig Write was Satoshi.  
As for approachability, I had asked Gavin some questions on multiple occasions in the past (you can find them in my history if you go back far enough) regarding the proposed block-size changes and their impact on bandwidth (specifically upstream) and he always seemed to avoid a direct answer and was dismissive.
The protocol is open source and I would think as easy as something like this can be while considering that it's actively being used and attacked and holds significant wealth.  
Regarding it's ability to be changed, anyone can change it but what's important is how you get people to support your change.  IMO Core has the support based on merit.  There is no lack of other implementations, they just don't win the "votes".

Not on the backdrop of global financial insanity.  Gold is stable but not very portable nor convenient.
I think this is an interesting and telling question: What's the predictable inflation rate of any fiat currency?  That's not even a valid question these days.  You can forecast Bitcoin's inflation policy out a hundred years.  Even if Bitcoin were not convenient to move, it would serve much the same purpose as gold in terms of being a check against inflation.  It just so happens to come with the benefit of being traded by the billions of USD every day to people around the globe with no chance of anyone being able to truly stop it.  Not at merchants, not in bank accounts, not at borders.
Add to that, while gold can be stored, the same gold can only be stored in one place and anyone with access to that place can take them from you.  The same bitcoin can be stored in multiple locations and should anyone find the spot they'd still need to know your (strong) password (as long as you encrypt your keys).  All of this is in the hands of the individual (with some limited tech knowledge) rather than requiring expensive and state controlled third parties to protect your wealth.

I see what you are saying but you seem narrowly focused on a specific type of attack that outbids other transactions.  What you seem to be neglecting is that filling block space with 0 or low fee spam transactions (not outbidding others) is also an attack that has real costs in bandwidth (not unlimited in most places in the world today and generally very limited on the important upstream side).  It also apparently has implications on block propagation time creating more opportunities for large miners to game at the expense of small ones (more centralization of power).  Solutions for that seem in the works now.  Both of these scenarios can cause centralization via making nodes unaffordable or impossible to run (where sufficient upstream is not available).
Maybe big blockers should step back and realize they've been crying wolf and predicting the demise or unseating of bitcoin for years yet it's still  and going strong.  We are close to SegWit and there are active tests on LN.

Could be.  Something seems different this time around.  For me its the India demonetization.  This is a anecdotal and generalized, but tech in general is huge and growing in India.  If I had to guess there is already a huge black-market economy there (the point of the demonetization) which is the perfect match for bitcoin.  Word will spread quickly and a large population being awoken to a tech solution will lead to viral adoption.
I think the demonetization event will prove to be like a Streisand effect for bitcoin.  Attack the black market, it attacks back.

Read more and engage and make your own decision.  I won't tell you what to think just what I think.  I think this is a very important project and Core is wise to err on the side of caution and decentralization to resist compromise via centralization or proving a hard fork can happen (because then a hard fork can be forced to change the fundementals).

So here's where we disagree.
FDIC is indirectly to protect government/fed monopoly on funny money since bank runs can happen on the fractional reserve system.  We are now building a new system that doesn't have these needs.
Social Security similarly is protecting government's hold on central management and taxation of wealth.  We have always had the ability to save for our own retirement and government's involvement has conveniently expanded their scope and involvement in the lives of citizens.
National parks and forest acts, I don't have enough knowledge of the specifics. 
The comment your replied to was clearly making the point that governments and more specifically their representatives, primarily care about themselves and not the citizenry, except to the extent required to secure their positions.  I think it would be hard for you to argue that is not the case against the backdrop of an expanding government, expanding budget and a government that seems disconnected from the citizenry.


People arguing against net neutrality simply believe the market generally works better than when the government stays out of it.  As for "protecting the climate", let's leave that for another day.


This is not a productive form of argument.


I can't decide if you are making their point or not.  This seems to be an admission that government prevents free markets which is why Libertarians want to minimize government involvement.


How do you think those monopolies are created in this specific case?  What's stopping regional wi-fi providers?  Likely government relationships the major ISPs and exclusive access to telecom poles.


So create monopoly which stifles competition and then regulate that monopoly.  Seems like an odd approach.


Basic fact, the FCC is a central point of regulation that arguably is not necessary in this case if the market is allowed to work.  If ISPs price gouge then competitors will be happy to come steal their customers as long as competition is allowed to develop and free to leverage the same public infrastructure.
Edit: this articulates the points much better: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:57:15


To roll it back to the light touch regulation which existed before.  That is literally the administration saying "we don't think government should be involved".  Do you know how happy the Bitcoin community would be if that statement was made about it?

This is an interesting point, but does he have an address that is a known Satoshi address with a small amount of BTC?  If not, he'd also be sending a message loud and clear that a large block of coins is in fact spendable.  Some may think this is a positive thing but many others that assumed his coins may not be liquid anymore may find that bad which could clearly influence price. At this stage if  were Satoshi I would be cautious about revealing such a thing.  Also, that's not the only reason I'd be cautious about revealing that.
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:46:53
OK, I'm going to negligently assume you have critical thinking skills despite how badly you've strayed from your original post to somehow get to this topic.
So "at least one core dev" publicly reports that he "kept sadly sending him emails", so that to you is logically equivalent to the real Satoshi being what, gone to never return?  That is sound logic to you?
1. This unnamed core dev could be lying at the request of Satoshi.
2. He may not be trusted by Satoshi.
3. He may be Satoshi (or one of the original collaborators)
Your statement in no way logically equates to Satoshi not being involved at all.
You have not in any way presented any argument that my arguments are cultish.  As a matter of fact you've not made one sound argument on this entire thread and transparently continue to change the subject.  It's completely laughable.

Elon Musk risking his entire worth on 1 idea, or the 3rd spacex launch not having a catastrophic problem like the prior 2 might have been deemed stupid at the time too.  All his eggs were in 1 basket.  As it turns out Musk's risks paid off.  If it didn't work out he would have been financially ruined.  That may seem like a stupid risk, but it brought with it a great reward.
The OPs risk in bitcoin is neither stupid nor smart, it's a risk that he calculated and only the future will tell if it pays off.
FYI, he mentioned that he's not spending blood money.
You may have a different risk tolerance so it would not be something you'd do, but declaring someone else's investment "stupid" is clearly subjective.  It's also not an argument just a statement so it lends no value.

I see your point.
At the same time one issue appears to be driven by the experimental/beta nature of bitcoin and events that apparently had to unfold over time and the other seems more like a core feature.  This is obviously a bit subjective.  That said I have not heard people saying things like "the bitcoin block size will only ever be 1MB", while we all have of course heard "there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence."  And with respect to the transaction volume, I think most would agree that the system as a whole has to be able to support more volume.  What the disagreement appears to be about is how, via blocksize increase, LN, sidechains, 3rd parties or some other future development.  These are significant differences that make the two issues distinct.
I do agree though that under the right circumstances the 21m limit could be changed, I just don't think it's at all likely.

Thank you sir.  These clowns are laughable.  I predicted this would get buttposted.  The hilarity is that is the one who introduced god-like qualities to Satoshi yet the butters claim I did. 
It is interesting the concerted effort put into spreading FUD and a clear lack of any sense of reason.  If they are not paid to do this then it's nothing short of pathetic.  It's hard to imagine the existence of people so anti-anything.  And to stick with it even now, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, mainstream news media coverage, and not the snickering CNBC like coverage of 2014.
The cross posting is also comical.  "A bitcoiner shredded me, come help me downvote him" as if karma is something valuable.  The irony there is pretty amazing too.

If you believe in the free market, I'm suggesting then the right approach would be to get municipalities to open up access to local providers, not to enact more onerous regulation that new companies will have to comply with, remembering that the way government works it always starts with the foot in the door.
In 1912 there was no Federal income tax (nor IRS, nor Federal Reserve).  In 1913 all were introduced and tax rates ranged from 1 to 7%.  Just 5 years later the rates were 6 to 77%.  Foot in the door.

You're missing the point.
If these ISP start blocking sites they will shed users to other ISPs that don't block sites, or people will route around them with technology - see dark web.


This is the sales pitch you've bought hook line and sinker.  Here's another sales pitch: "If you like your doctor you can keep him!" via "**Affordable** Care Act".  See how that works?


And my suggestion is to let them make the mistakes so that the market handles the problem, not to let the mob come in to fix it for us.  Protect yourself, don't subscribe to the protection racket that's creating the problem in the first place.

IMO the mistake you are making is subscribing to the idea that you need government for such trivial things.  If ISPs blocked Bitcoin traffic it would be the seminal moment for a new industry and/or technology.  Just like attacks on Bitcoin in general make it stronger, measures like this would only make markets stronger.
While you claim I and other people are misguided, you are the one suggesting that the government is working in your interest while apparently investing in a technology that is thriving due to 50+ years of government failing with respect to monetary policy and an arbitrarily inflatable unbacked paper money.  So at least my "hardon" is ideologically consistent.

Despite the fact that it's intentionally tangential I'll answer you.  I believe he does weigh in with his opinion on subjects, just not as publicly as you seem to be suggesting he should.  I also think he recognizes that his creation is now, as designed, being controlled and influenced by many people, not just one person.  I also doubt he's the type of person that cares if he's materially wealthy or not.
Either way he has had a profound impact on our society already, even if bitcoin were to fail as the cat's out of the bag and the concepts and forces of decentralization have been propelled forward.

Again, a hypothetical situation based on a static view with only one proposed solution.  
It goes without saying that if the circumstances were just right and this was the only possible option, people would take it.  But it's a strange thought experiment at best.

I agree, that's not enough.  The reason there are likely not tens of providers is that the cost of entry for the small players is driven up by the cost of compliance with regulations.  Smaller ISPs could be focusing solely on their business but instead have to be concerned about regulations.  This is relatively easy for large corporations and harder for small players.

Bob, can you propose how bitcoin could face certain disaster, like the ones that historically have required money printing?  Unless I'm mistaken this was not a problem with hard currencies like gold themselves.  It only happens as a result of the unfortunate link between government and currency being created.  Governments need to print more money because governments spend recklessly.  Bitcoin by definition was created to sever that link and create a stable and predictable system free of trendy manipulation.  TBI's piece essentially amounts to sacrilege yet he's wondering why he's gotten such negative feedback.
Regarding some of the other issues in TBI's piece:
1. The irony regarding his concern about the BTC wealthy is that unlike fiat systems, that wealth is much harder to use to change very important things about the system like the money supply/inflation rate which he is proposing to change!  Similar to my opening point, that risk is caused not by wealth but by exertion of that wealth on governments controlling the money supply.
2. Assuming block rewards won't be enough incentive to keep the network safe is just that, an assumption and likely a bad one.  It would mean that the price of bitcoin will not have significantly risen.  If it hasn't then the mining requirements for the security of the network is smaller as well.  We likely have a huge buffer at this point and could afford to lose significant mining power if all else stayed the same.  That said, I don't think this community, with the amount of interest in it is expecting to remain static.
3. Creating inflation is not a solution to the halvings.  It's just moving the cost from fees that affect spenders to devaluation that affects everyone.  I can't pretend to predict the overall impact, but I don't think this this will help.  Inflation in this system (unlike in fiat systems) is well known and factored into the price already.  We are seeing price stability despite inflation.  We will know more next year at the halving.  My gut is that the adoption and price will be up by then which means an increase in mining fees and a higher than half block reward when translated into local currency.  In case that sounds complicated, for example (using USD for ease) if BTC is at $400 next year, the block reward will have not decreased in USD by 50% but by only ~30%.  If BTC's at $500 the decrease will be only ~11%.
4. If weak mining power somehow did threaten the system, people with a vested interest in the system, namely frequent users, wealthy hoarders and bitcoin companies, would have a vested interest in running miners and/or investing in them, just like with nodes.
5. TBI's models also assume the cost of mining will not be spread out and efficiency increased, the likes of what 21 seems to be working on.
There are many more points to make but these are the main ones I see. 
Regarding this: "Consider that at a 2% inflation subsidy, the ownership by long-term holders only gets diluted by half every ~35 years."
No thanks.  You're missing the point completely.

I haven't found a convenient source of fresh information but you can use this site which has over 3 year old data to see that even then most places were covered by wireless coverage and most population centers had 1 usually more ISPs:
Again, remember this is old data.
You can also use this site  to see what providers are available in a given zip code.  This data seems more up to date.  Every zip code I've tried, first using google maps to pick random locations, had at least two wired broadband provides, 2 satellite providers and sometimes a WI-FI provider.  Most areas are also covered by mobile as in 3G/4G access.

I know this is controversial, and I don't authoritatively know if there is a link between the parties but some may find this interesting if they haven't been following along.  My interpretation (MI) of each included for convenience.  Obviously your interpretation may differ:
"Satoshi Nakamoto": 
Sat Aug 15 17:43:54 UTC 2015: "[Bitcoin XT Fork...]( - MI: Slow down on the Hard Fork, be cautious of major changes.
1:26 PM - 16 Aug 2015: "A much more reasonable block size proposal, following historical growth rates in a "limiting nutrient" resource: [ - MI: Retweets a 4.4% block size increase per about every 100 days.
1:29 PM - 16 Aug 2015: "Bitcoin block size debate cf. Liebig's law of the minimum: growth is limited by the scarcest resource [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum …]( - MI: Implication: ISP home bandwidth pricing is not the right metric to use when considering scaling the block size.  Question: Did Gavin use this in his calculations?
1:40 PM - 16 Aug 2015: " A rapid block size increase is a huge security risk: a reckless act to be performing on a $4 billion system." - MI: Pretty clearly articulated.
2:11 PM - 16 Aug 2015: "Per law of minimum, the most relevant resources in Bitcoin block size debate are bandwidth bottlenecks &amp; DRAM costs, not average bandwidth."  - MI: Implication: DRAM prices and bandwidth bottlenecks (TOR?) have not "dropped' as quickly as has the cost of internet access, so basing the block size increase on something other than these is not appropriate.

Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs, Nick Szabo  1999
[ …" - TL;DR: Micro payments have mental costs that make the technical barriers less important than the mental barriers.  This is an example of why people tend to prefer flat rate pricing, like cell phone plans, despite the fact that it might be "cheaper" to have metered pricing, because the mental cost of checking/evaluating the metered pricing required mental costs. MI2: If micropayments may not be mentally feasible/desirable until novel methods of communicating those are developed, perhaps we shouldn't risk the security of our fragile system in an attempt to attain them via direct blockchain transactions.
So, there is still room left for debate as arguments have been made that it's not just micropayments that require bigger blocks and I tend to agree.  Supporting raising the block size seems not to be at issue here though, just the rate at which it's done and the variables upon which it's based.
My opinion doesn't really matter, but for what it's worth I've found the arguments on both side compelling, am still confused as to what the correct course of action is and do have to admit that trusting a clearly smarter authority with more domain experience, whether it's Satoshi Nakamoto or Nick Szabo or someone else in the space, is tempting.  I think there is a case to be made that priority 1 should be protecting digital gold.  Understandably both sides believe they are doing that, one by being conservative and the other by trying to ensure ample growth in adoption.  This is a complex debate.  I think we need to stay mindful of that and be respectful to alternate opinions - and find a forum where these ideas can be openly discussed.  We all lose if we don't get this right.

And considering there are many more Core nodes than S2X, it's not a 2 way street.  It's more like a 10 lane highway in 1 direction and 1 lane in the other direction.  Core nodes don't need to leech of them.


Then do what works for you and stop spreading information you're not sure about.  I can't find the post quickly but I read that if you get isolated among S2X nodes as peers after the fork you won't be able to find a path to a Core node without restarting peer discovery.  It appears to require at least some action on the user's part, so it seems being proactive would be better than having to be reactive.

Thanks for the data point.
It seems they are suggesting it to be related to a technical issue, but the fact that they don't just credit my account with the funds after identifying the issue leads me to believe they don't have the funds. 
If nobody could get funds off then they'd have a major problem, but if a minority of users have "technical issues" that somehow can't be resolved (after 8 days and counting already) then they have plausible deniability.
If I ran the exchange and it was solvent I'd credit the users's account 1st and look into fixing the bug 2nd, unless I didn't have the funds to do it.
It'd be great for this to get more visibility, at least to put pressure on them to recover the funds and to warn others of the risk.

That's not true.  Video chat would experience extra latency, but would still be usable.  Online gaming would likely not be usable.  Downstream streaming services like Netflix and Youtube would be just fine.


You're correct I'm making an assumption.  It's that if some ISPs screw over their customers the resulting customer demand would go to other providers, both existing and new ones that would pop up.
Some people tend to think 1 statically, but we live in a very dynamic system.  If we allow the market to work it will.  If companies price gouge, small players will come in to take the resulting profit that's left on the table.

I agree they complement each other, currently. I also believe both have value in terms of diversification, currently.
As for "BTC has no intrinsic value", the ability to secure wealth "off-world" is a unique value proposition, not a fault.  It is one of it's primary intrinsic values.

@_date: 2015-08-05 16:20:46
I'm not arguing anything except that your assumptions are probably not correct.  Bitpay is the largest processor of bitcoin to fiat payments.  The blockchain processes bitcoin to bitcoin payments without need of a payment processor like bitpay.  You might want to compare overall transaction volume on the blockchain to bitpay's volume.  That may get you some meaningful data.  That will still not give you the whole picture however as addresses and transactions cannot easily be mapped to users.  But at least it gets you something more meaningful than trying to just guess what % of users have used bitpay.

Generally speaking what keeps them from competing is onerous regulation.  Government creates the problems and then swoops in to solve them - thanks!
Oligopolies generally leverage the ruling class to hold back the small players.  I'm suggesting we take the ruling class out and allow the free market to work, as it largely did until 2015 with few exceptions that likely would have rectified themselves without the NN act.
Are you old enough to remember the Microsoft monopoly and governments taking action against them?  Now look at the landscape.

The bartender bribe was the best analog I could come up with on short notice, albeit imperfect.  The point was a separate channel seems like it would get messy and would also seem mostly unnecessary.  It would be more reliable and robust to build the logic into his systems and include a sufficient fee from the start.
It doesn't seem like this would be such a hard problem to solve as there is a ledger outlining the recent accepted transactions and fees, and if I understand the protocol well enough, the nodes know all the details of their backlogged transactions.  Even on a day like any of the past few days it would seem rather simple to calculate the maximum fee in the mempool and then beat it by some threshold.  That algorithm could also conceivably return a 0 fee when the lack of a fee would be likely to succeed (small/liquid mempool and less than full blocks).
So while I highly respect the OP and appreciate the question/idea, I'm suggesting this may essentially be a choice between a long term solution and a short term patch.

No, I'm suggesting we not look to the government for answers to which the free market will solve.  This is a pattern that is constantly repeated and people never seem to learn the lesson. Government is not the solution most of the time, in fact it's usually the problem (ISPs are limited to few because of deals with municipal governments).

Why are you assuming there is no relationship between price and adoption?  Right now they are clearly linked.  Network effects are in full effect.  More people speculating = more people who know what bitcoin is and who own it, and even in the case of pure speculators, more people who will inevitably be starting to learn why Bitcoin is special.  Waves of minds coming online and being enlightened is certainly something to celebrate.
You seem to have the somewhat jaded perspective of someone that's sitting on the cutting edge asking "what has Bitcoin done for me lately?" while millions of new users are marveling at it for the first time and just now starting to grasp its brilliance and potential.

@_date: 2017-11-22 15:35:03
I don't see any of the situations you posted as being a problem government needed to solve.  Most were providers protecting their investment by not allowing users to exploit their service.  For example a plan priced for a phone that was instead used to tether a PC would clearly be outside the intent of the plan and likely said so in the user's contract.
Forcing ISPs to allow their competition to use their own infrastructure isn't good for competition, it's bad for providing incentive for investment in infrastructure.
If we let actual competition happen we see prices come down and utility go up.  We see this with Bitcoin.  Banks are so highly regulated with such a high barrier to entry that the customer truly gets screwed.  Bitcoin, as in free market money, will clearly disrupt that market.  The same holds for ISPs if we allow competition.
Also, entrenched ISPs that choose to screw their customers will be that much more likely to lose them to smaller competition that offers a more open internet.  Wireless has evolved incredibly over the last 10 years and stands to completely disrupt wired ISPs.
The answer is less government enabled monopoly, not more government regulation.

Aside from that I think it's an interesting thought experiment.

This is going to sound pompous, but I promise it's true.  A few months ago I "invented" bitid, or I should say my own version of it before I realized it already existed...  I had started to build it and got a basic prototype working.  Then I started to think about and design the idea that the identity wallet could also house other personal information for that very purpose.  I had hopes that this could be a new trend in that sites would not only not have your username and password stored (we all know why that's not a great idea), but for businesses that didn't need a permanent record of your address, for example if they only needed it in the case of shipping, they could request it via a persistent session with the wallet or perhaps another QR request.  This seems very similar to what you are suggesting and I of course agree this is a great idea :).
You might want to check out SQRL, another similar idea to BitID that I believe predates it, as it seemed like they had done a great job of blowing out important details that I hadn't even thought about yet, like how do you "reset your password" so to speak.  So they may have already fleshed out some of these more advanced features.
Your head's in the right place :).

Between the end of 2008 and the present there was $3.1 trillion added to the money supply, and in the raw GDP chart here:
you'll see that there was $2.7 trillion in GDP growth over approximately the same period.
Perhaps the inflation numbers they are using in the "real" GDP chart are the government endorsed and tweaked numbers.  
My assumption was that the GDP/Monetary Base chart showed this with the negative slope.  Perhaps I'm looking at it incorrectly?
Also, if the money supply goes from $847 Billion to almost $4 trillion in 7 years, how can the real inflation rate could be so low?  That's 3500% over 7 years.  I'm not sure what that works out to annually but it's more significant than the paltry few % we are expected to believe.

The fact that armed robberies happen doesn't mean fiat is insecure (though multiplying the money supply may be a feature that makes that security less relevant).
Similarly, the fact that someone created an insecure system that allowed people to steal bitcoin does not mean that bitcoin is insecure.  In fact I'm having a hard time imagining anything more securable.
If you have door locks and a security system in your home, the fact that you might get nailed by an asteroid does not mean that having locks is a futile exercise or that your security is flawed.
In other words, one thing (Mt. Gox/Asteroid) has nothing to do with the other (Bitcoin security/your door locks).

I'll validate it because it's not hypocrisy.  Let's talk music.  Some people don't have access to enough disposable income to afford the rates that are required for something that is essentially free (with ads we've come to expect and ignore/change the station) on the radio.  As a practical matter the basic choices are:
1. Listen to the radio.
2. Listen to streaming radio.
3. Pay iTunes/Other distribution channel.
4. Listen on YouTube.
5. Pirate it.
6. Pirate it and donate to artist.
Options 1 through 3 net the artist a paltry % of what the consumer pays and "the system" (yes, like the man), get's the lion's share of the price for providing what is essentially a very inexpensive commodity service at scale.
Options 4 and 5 only cost the artists if the consumer would have ponied up for their content vs. listening for free or not bothered at all.  This is the key point.  "Free" is fundamentally different that "not free" and just because a song was streamed or downloaded a million times does not translate that into a lost revenue of 1 million x the retail price despite what the RIAA would have us all believe in their prosecution of file sharers.  Some people, if forced to pay will simply not participate because they can't afford to or the music is just not worth the asking price.  This concept apparently never occurs to most people despite the fact that most people make decisions like this every day about other items.  Bottled vs. tap for example.  Adding to this, music itself is a commodity not really limited in the slightest.  If artist A charged 10 times the price of similar artist B, people would likely vote with their pocket book and artist B would develop a larger following.  At a certain disposable income level people likely buy less and listen to more radio.
Add to this that free music for people who wouldn't or couldn't otherwise pay for music is like a free sample, the artists are potentially gaining a consumer which can translate to real world value if/when they reach the threshold in terms of income or fan level to be able to support the artist.
Now consider the rationalization (yes that's what it is, but it's also sound logic with an economic driver and is the reality of the situation) that the artist would only get a small sliver of the price paid and it's very easy to see why people would feel completely comfortable pirating music.
Another point, if someone doesn't like the music, they won't keep it/listen to it - the product is essentially "returned" and the model is no different than any other refundable purchase.  If they do like it, they are likely to be a supporter at some level, either recommending the artist or at some point attending a concert or perhaps buying other merchandise or even music in the future.
Now introduce direct payment, or direct artist tipping (been around for a very long time - google it, so there must be something to it) and the equation changes.  Radiohead's pay what you want appeared to be a huge success for many of these reasons.
Finally, it is reasonable to consider that some people would rather pirate music from a corrupt system than to support the system.  They see the system very distinctly different than the artist and may even consider it abusive to artists.  I know I do and eagerly await the iTunes moment but where the artist makes the lion's share (90% seems like a much fairer number to me).  So piracy is a way to protest the system while supporting, as a fan (perhaps not financially, or via direct donation/payment when available) without supporting a system that you may believe abuses artists.
I don't speak for the OP but these seem like rational reasons why "i have never really felt guilty doing this because at the end of the day...".  I think the morality of it is way to complicated to state "you are an immoral person."
One last point.  I think most musicians start out making almost nothing and playing gigs for very little or free.  The reason for this is to garner a fan base.  Once that base is established it seems a little odd that concept and that model breaks down.  Except for the biggest artists (a very small % of all artists) there will always be new ears, and letting those ears hear your music should have the same value proposition later as it did when an artist was just starting up.  IMO the Record Labels and distributors that have inserted themselves into the process to extract the most possible money are the ones that have defined the terms and the debate.  For example is it "pirating" or is it "browsing"?
As the OP commented later, the idea that essentially digital cash makes it directly into the pocket of the artist, like a tip in a hat, or a direct CD sale, makes the bitcoin development change the dynamics just a bit more in a positive direction.  I think that's a great observation.
Just my take.

Bob, while quoting me, you didn't address the question directly.  There is no historical precedent for this.  
Of course the code can be altered.  My post made no contradictory claim.
Regarding "in a pretty radical way", I'm not 100% sure but that seems like a bug fix to me.  Notably also from that bip's text: 
"Despite the nice showoff of underhanded programming skills - **we want Bitcoin to be well-specified. Otherwise, we're clearly in for a bumpy ride**:"
I think people's issue with both TBI's post and as an extension your comments, simply stem from the way it the initial post was framed.  
TBI: "As I explained on Friday, there is exactly one thing I am certain of when it comes to bitcoin mining: it will look markedly different in five years than it does today."  
This is a prediction based on many assumptions.  For one, as I showed above, if the bitcoin price moves, say triples in 5 years (conceivable and precedented) mining profitability can stay well within today's range with nothing else changing, electricity economies, chip improvements, infrastructure cost depreciation etc.  
Regarding TBI's main point, no, 2% inflation wouldn't be horrible if the adoption was growing by more than that.  That said, one of the benefits of bitcoin, as noted in the above bip quote, is that the most important rules are static.
Yes it's possible that we'll all agree at some future point during a theoretical existential crisis, but it seems a bit absurd to suggest bitcoin should change based on such uncertainty.  If we run into a situation where that is the best possible option and can somehow reach consensus, sure.  But that's a bizarre fantasy world at this stage, a far out thought experiment, not a likely or certain scenario the way it was framed.

The idea is to not further the problem with the current reality by repeating the same mistakes of turning to government to solve problems.


This is a false argument.  This generation of people are not on social security because they got fucked over, they are on it because it's sold as a retirement plan when it's anything but.


It's a pool dude not a pension: 
"Thus, when you pay into Social Security, you're not funding your own personal retirement account. Rather, the taxes you pay are pooled with the rest so that today's recipients can collect benefits. When it's your turn to retire, future workers' taxes will be used to fund your benefit payments."




Here's the type of thing that likely got us at odds with each other last time.  My comment was meant to acknowledge I don't know enough about the topic yet you somehow misrepresent it as taking a position, straw man it and then use ad hominem.  You're better than that, I've seen it.




That's obviously not a fair characterization.  The thing I find striking is that you can make sound arguments when it comes to the S2X attack for example, logical and sound, but in this case you are clearly getting emotional.  Our country survived for 150 years without social programs and if anything society is headed on a down trend in terms of personal responsibility, despite being at an incredible technological cusp.  People are submitting to the state when 105 years ago (prior to 1913) their interaction would likely have been limited to their interactions with the Post office.  You're of course entitled to your opinion and belief that a nanny state is a better choice than a libertarian state, but in this country you might want to be open to the ideas of others and leave the emotions at home.  
I also find it hard to reconcile being a supporter of a technology that is thriving specifically because it is not controlled by the state and your position of apparent statism.
If you choose to respond, please keep it civil.

It's fair as long as you limit the discussion to scenarios other than total dystopia.
I agree it's a rabbit hole. Other similar future hypothetical (non dystopian) points to consider though are that gold at some point might be mined from asteroids, be atomically created, lose it's luster so to speak with investors and cultures, lose value because of its physicality as we increasingly digitize our lives (and potentially upload our minds into the cloud) etc.
Regarding dystopia, Gold too requires some form of civilization to remain intact to keep it's value going, a user base, and an interest in a shiny metal to keep itself going.  Canned soup, liters of gasoline, guns and ammo for example might be better investments/stores of value/units of account than gold under scenarios where we need to worry access to electricity.
I like to hold all of the above just in case since this is not a situation where there can be only one.
Barring that dystopian future, it's looking like Bitcoin might be the heir to the throne and we may see a taper over time out of gold and into Bitcoin.

I tend to adjust my rate by how productive I feel I've been.  If I spend 3 hours learning and with not much doing I chalk it up to my gain and charge a low 0% to 20%.  If I'm somewhat productive I'll charge in the realm of 50%.  At normal productivity 100%.  That won't help if he want's an up front estimate, but if he trusts you and you want to be fair about it, my scheme may help.  It's also not particularly unique, kind of obvious :)  I won't actually change the rate but I'll change the hours I book accordingly.  2 hours @ 50% = 1 hour.
Alternatively you can look back at your work afterwards, after gaining the knowledge and try to estimate what it would take you to do it from scratch again.  Those two methods in theory should produce similar results.

Great, it's a pension, but it's not an individual retirement plan which is the ideal.  Would you prefer a personal plan or if your retirement relied on future tax dollars that may or may not be there?  For someone supporting trustless non-governmental currency you seem to put a lot of trust into the government.


The government I'm referring to is the ruling class that is clearly out of touch with the plight of average Americans. They are apparently more concerned with their re-election (for those that are elected) than doing right by the citizens.  Politicians with meager net worth and average government salaries leave office as multi millionaires.  How do you think that happens?


I'm Libertarian/Constitutionalist.  Are you a statist?  Your defenses seem to indicate as much.

Please explain how with industrialization and radically increased productivity we should need more government and not less?  Please explain to me how economies of scale have lead to a larger government rather than smaller?

I think you need to peer a little deeper into Satoshi's other comments or you will miss the point.
From the whitepaper:
"With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need."
As banks do, not only because they need it but because the government mandates it.  Satoshi could only mean more privacy than via existing systems.  Banks only protect people's information from each other, not from employees, partners or the government.  
"As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner."
Purportedly from bitcointalk:
"Yes, (we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography), but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."
Since Satoshi saw this as an arms race for freedom, we can safely imply he wanted to protect the network, which implies protecting the people using the network.  CoinJoin is very consistent with that ideology.
I think your liberal philosophy is getting in the way of seeing this and makes you the outlier.
You are of course entitled to your own opinion, but I would suggest you consider the implications of losing privacy, both on a personal level and as it applies to the network as a whole.  
The MPAA routinely leverages the state to attack the BitTorrent network and it's users, and that's just about content and theoretical lost profits.  This is about money, removing the middleman.  This conflict is directly between the state and citizens.

They directly referred to BitPesa, another digital currency, albeit a different kind.  The main relevant differences amount to BitPesa being a medium of exchanging mobile minutes and local goods and services, and Bitcoin while not having a direct correlation to mobile minutes, which can be used internationally and for various services/products.  Bitcoin is also more decentralized than BitPesa.
The point Melinda was making was that since it's digital and there's no corrupt/able middleman, they can be sure that the funds are making it to it's intended audience.  Also that people can use their phones in lieu of and instead of banks.  This is common to the two digital currencies.

OK, so you make the rules then?
My statement was that the fed's numbers are rigged and the real numbers are likely closer to 10%.  My table shows this as the increases for most of life's necessities have seen at least double the inflation of the supposed CPI.  Your failure to realize this despite your apparent highly educated brain is not my problem, and no, you don't make the rules.
How do you suggest that we have only 2.8% inflation over 14 years when the monetary base was expanded over 4 times?  How do you explain that the state inflation numbers are so low when actual items that people need, food, shelter, health care have gone up by at least double that rate?  How is your 8% looking?  It's looking pretty flat to me and it'll be looking worse when the QEs come home to roost.
The fact that you don't address any of this and put your faith in politicians and pseudo-scientists at the fed will not save your ass when your fake money fails, which it essentially has, but the printing presses and artificially controlled interests rates, the last resorts mind you, are in full swing and as low as they can go.

Others have brought up the issue of bandwidth and the impact on decentralization.  This is a concern too.
I'm not against an increase.  I'm the camp I described above that just wants to proceed with caution.

That is how it was marketed, but IMO it's a misnomer. Generally the biggest barrier to entry to markets is regulation, not the size of your competition, except as it relates to them using their size to lobby the government or hire staff for compliance to increase their advantage over smaller players that don't have the margin to do the same.  There are many smaller local providers that can quickly establish a presence with limited investment via inexpensive wireless installations.  Wireless tech is getting better and less expensive.

You seem confused.  I didn't stress qualifications, just that if you don't believe it in, and you trust that the banks will hold your funds for you securely, you probably should not trust yourself with bitcoin.
You brought up education as if to suggest a degree trumps real world experience.  I've seen many educated people lose a shit ton of money in the market, and educated finance folks don't always make money.  Some jump out windows.
As I mentioned I'm not trying to convert anyone, just point out the fallacy of your argument, which you seem to continue to make.  Most money stolen in the US is the USD.  Most drugs are bought/sold in USD but that has no relevance to the security of the underlying currency.
I don't have to live anything down as I had nothing to do with Mt. Gox nor did I lose any money with it.  There is also a ton of activity going on that has nothing to do with Mt. Gox.
When you start making points beyond Mt. Gox you may start to establish some semblance of credibility.  Until that point it just seems like you're attempting to get more mileage than simply knowing just one Bitcoin fact affords.

I'm no authority but my neurons are registering a warning of sorts, as if this reminds me of something in the real world but I can't pinpoint it.  The closest parallel I can articulate on short notice is bribing a bartender, which while directly benefiting the bartender, indirectly hurts the bar as people become disenfranchised with long lines while others queue through...  
I see your need, but wouldn't a more reliable fee prediction service (based on current mempool sizes and recent successful fees) be a less Frankensteiny solution?  I'd think the node software would have all the information required to make a reasonable minimum fee prediction.

You've just tightened constraints to someone using their daily rationing EUR to make your point.  I haven't seen anyone suggest such a thing.  Some folks, the ones with their eyes opened likely have access to more EUR and/or assets they could trade for Bitcoin.
Why would they want Bitcoin?:
1. Because EUR may start to crash thanks to 1 country already being insolvent and 3 others potentially close behind.
2. Because you can store it safely and nobody can keep you from accessing it.
3. Because you can move it easily across borders.
Also, there are other use cases for Bitcoin, for example someone transfers it to a family member in Greece, or travelers who are already in Greece need to use it since they cannot currently use their credit cards.  In those cases someone might accept less bitcoin, just as someone may accept less EUR because money is being rationed.
Talking about a 3% drop in the face of insolvency, rationing and potentially a crisis that will echo through Europe seems a bit petty.
By the way, it looks as if Bitcoin already retraced most of what it gave back.  At the moment on paper in the past 24 hours the EUR has lost 1% and BTC is even.
The whole idea that someone would buy Bitcoin for EUR and then immediately spend it (apparently as the OP suggests) is preposterous.

This is the most serious obstacle Bitcoin has possibly ever faced.  I have growing confidence that it will overcome it, but it's not a done deal.  I hope it overcomes it and if it does we should see a big bounce.  That said, in my assessment, while the reward will be atypically high, the risk is as well.
As for burying the tech, if this attack succeeds, it will not likely bury the technology at large, but it may seal Bitcoin in particular's fate, and will likely set back the industry some time as new solutions are worked out in terms of governance to protect from attacks like this, or until new leaders emerge that may already have novel solutions.

Don't rule the free market out just yet: 


That's a defeatist mentality. Another more approachable option is to break those local monopolies by voting in small government representatives that will break the monopolistic deals.  Or even better, in the spirit of Bitcoin, use technology to create local mesh networks that can't be shut down.  These have been discussed and I'm sure the technology is progressing, but perhaps just needs some support.  This would be a much more positive direction to sink one's effort vs. resigning to "we need government to fix the mess they created" mentality.


I disagree.  It's another government control mechanism that can be gamed by incumbents to prevent competition.  In it's current state it may look like it has good intentions (all of them do) but it sets precedent for central control.  It very well could be that a few years in the future the FCC deems that all ISPs must enforce deep packet inspection and blocking of crypto packets.  Governments are much more likely to impose this than ISPs who seem mainly concerned with not allowing competitors to eat their lunch using their own networks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:08:30
Right, so then why do you want the government to have anything more than a light touch on how it's run?  Governments enable monopolies via creation of regulations that raise the cost of entering the market.  Look at the taxi cab cartel that is only now being busted by Uber/Lyft and in some cases being protected by government.

Credit cards can do that, but with a 3rd party involved, higher fees and overhead in the form of integrating with those 3rd parties, potentially having to migrate from one to another (think ecommerce merchant accounts, regulation and acquisitions), and managing those accounts.  I think what 21 may be doing is simplifying all of it by allowing you to essentially pay with something you already pay for, electricity, and what you get in return are all these smart connected devices able to do whatever it is they want to do.  Also consider that these devices could work the same way no matter where they were deployed around the globe.  The same can't be said for devices dependent on credit card based systems.
I think the first case that will emerge is that Qualcomm 1000x micro cell ubiquitous wireless access.  So plug a device in and it connects via mesh or maybe through your home network, expanding the reach of other devices.  It pays for its own bandwidth usage (in the case it's not wired directly to the net) via electricity it uses to mine and via bandwidth paid by its clients.  This can then serve as the communications framework for the other devices that want to be on the network.
And, you may not have to even configure these devices.  With your scheme you'd have to somehow provide your insecure credit card private keys for transmission somewhere, or you'd have to store those securely centrally (we see how well that works - ApplePay apparently can't even get that right) and then essentially would have to build a pub/priv key mechanism that the devices all use.  With Bitcoin it provides much of that out of the box.
That said, there are still important details to work out, like dealing with surpluses or deficits, so perhaps one would need to configure the devices or at least discover all the public keys (to top the accounts up).
Similarly, you could listen to mp3s on hand held devices long before the iPod/iPhone, but Apple (in theory) made the whole process easier.  Just because you can do something today without bitcoin doesn't mean that bitcoin can't/won't make it significantly easier.

I don't think anyone is suggesting blood money should be invested in Bitcoin.  I wouldn't suggest investing the 60EUR per day that people are being allowed to withdraw.  They likely need that money to live.  The idea is that savings that had been withdrawn over the lead up to the restrictions, could be put into Bitcoin (some of it) as then at least you can be guaranteed access to your wealth.   Also, many people are suggesting that other at risk members of the EU should prepare better so they don't face the same issue of access to "their own money" that is being held by banks.


The EUR is likely going to be volatile over the coming months as well.
I think there is also a lesson in here for people in all countries with banking controls (all countries with banks?)  Banks aren't simply safety deposit boxes for your money.  They are tools of the state.  The only way to ensure that your money is in fact yours is to hold it, either physically with precious metals, or by using Bitcoin.
Lastly, someone on another thread made a great point.  BitReserve or Coinapult locks could be used to pin a BTC balance to a more "reliable" currency or asset thereby avoiding most of the volatility of bicoin (excepting of course for the existential volatility - that it might fail and disappear).  Services like BitGold could also be used for wealth protection.  This is not an endorsement of any of those services and I don't have any personal experience with them.

OK, but you see that there is competition, right?  So you are limited to one ISP based on your specific preferences, but very low latency seems like a very specific need not likely to affect most people.  If Comcast started blocking Netflix or whatever it's believed will happen, you have options, you may just lose some frags.
IMO if we didn't have so much government intervention you'd have even more options as those regs drive up the cost of operations significantly.  Having to worry about regulations and not just focus on your core business drives up the costs disproportionately for smaller players.

Bitcoin, like all technologies, especially those breaking new ground, is evolving.  No, straight bandwidth is not the issue (that was not my point btw, it was a parallel) however the effects of bandwidth requirements on the network dynamics and cost of hosting nodes is an issue, just like ensuring long verification times don't create opportunities to game mining.
How do deal with spam is another issue.  Currently Litecoin deals with spam more efficiently, however currently the Market cap of Litecoin is 1/8th of Bitcoins so this community chooses to proceed with a bit more caution than that one.

That's all well and good.  That said, if you are a prudent investor you should have the wits to know that calling something "a mirage" when you don't really understand it is unwise to say the least.  
That quote is likely to follow him like many other short-sighted remarks throughout history.  He would have been better served to call it "interesting" and say his advisors are "looking into it" and he's taking a "cautious" position on it in the meantime.  Or even "I wouldn't invest in it since I don't understand it."  That's a wise and age-old investment strategy.  Saying it's "a mirage" is an authoritative statement, clearly without any basis.

Antpool for example is made up of Bitmain's own miners and client miners and hosted client miners which are shippable on demand.  Until you can support that some large % are not individuals, I don't think these claims and concerns are valid.  Bitmain miners sell frequently on ebay and my guess would be that their pool, being  right now makes it an attractive pool for individual miners, and small and medium private miners.

It's quite a good analogy, you just didn't finish the logic.  Of the two scenarios you presented, which has the lowest overall cost per passenger and therefore lowest fees?  Hint: to use your own analogy include the cost per mile per lane.  In real life this is said to be around $1M/mile just for the build out (more CPU, storage and most importantly bandwidth).  Don't forget maintenance (initial sync time/expense for new nodes).   SegWit+LN packs more transactions per on-chain KB which clearly means lower fees per transaction.  SegWit introduces the buses.  With LN, the regular commuting passengers (and possibly more) are diverted to "airports" that transport them instantly.  These airports need fuel, which is transported by self driving trucks on the toll roads and charged a very high toll rate relative to their size, but low compared to their utility for the fuel they carry to move customers by "air".
SegWit+LN is a win-win-win.  Passengers have lower cost of travel which is also then instant, airports introduce a value added service which both brings the instant travel and significantly increased capacity, and the toll roads are collecting high tolls per area, require much less cost of maintenance and they are very safe (not flooded with free loaders and no speed traps).

I had read (I wish I could remember where) of one being used where the system constrained it to only allow a full payout of the payment or refund amount, in addition to the release of the deposits.  
So basically in that variant (if I understand it correctly) the parties agree to full payment or full refund but cannot agree to a split.  This might seem counter intuitive, but I think the idea was to stop complicated gaming scenarios.  An example might be feedback extortion offering to return half the money for a positive review.
That constraint might imply 3-of-3 actually, the 3rd being the system's, but I'm not multi-sig expert so don't quote me. :)
At first blush it might seem limiting but I think the simplicity basically makes the odds of a successful transaction higher as the options are limited.  Again, I don't know enough to know if that's true but it seems very interesting.

Your "golden principle" has been oversimplified for the sake of trying to make your point.  A change being simple in the context of the comments of doesn't mean a change that is simple to make.  It means a change has limited implications.  These are two different things and should be handled differently.
Changing UI text is simple with no implications.  Changing a field size in a database is simple with broader implications.  Changing an API call name is simple with even broader implications (though here the sooner the better rule applies).  Changing a thread's priority is simple too, but in the right circumstances the implications could mean your app crashes.
The anti-immediate-block-size-change crowd is made of multiple constituents.  There are likely people in that group that desire rarity of transactions in hopes that the fee market fires up, but I doubt they are the majority.  I think they are more likely people that think the ideas need more testing before acceptance. In fact Nick Szabo retweeted:

This is an interesting point, but only one small part of the game theory that needs to be considered.  You seem to snarkily assert it as proof that the block size limit should be raised.  I don't think it's that simple.

It wasn't meant to bolster anything (while your sample of 1 was).  It's an exaggeration to make a point.  Btw, it's also potentially "possible" via DNA splicing as each of the components exists or existed, large winged animals, color changing capability and horned heads.  To focus on this however is to completely miss the point.  Perhaps you should look up "metaphor" or "sarcasm" to see what those are all about.


That's the first valid point you've made in all of your posts here.  
Here's the top 6 node type counts according to [21.co](
1	/Satoshi:0.11.2/	2480 (41.08%)
2	/Classic:0.11.2/	982 (16.27%)
3	/Satoshi:0.11.0/	495 (8.20%)
4	/Satoshi:0.11.1/	327 (5.42%)
5	/Satoshi:0.10.2/	264 (4.37%)
6	/Satoshi:0.12.0/	180 (2.98%)
Looks like 1, 3, 4, and 5 are still pretty current and will likely take a little while to upgrade.  Perhaps some of those will switch to classic but I think if they were that keen on it they'd have done it already.  The stable crowd likely will get to it when they need to as it seems the bulk of them have historically.  Core 0.11.2 is only 3 months old and 0.12.0 isn't officially out yet so 57% of the network is currently running on the .11.x release or 0.12 RC to the 16% running classic on their brand new heavily data center hosted nodes.  Also notable, the percentages of all other nodes have been lessened by the artificial increase introduced by classic vs. had classic actually converted all of it's nodes.  If those new Classic nodes stay online for a good clip of time, say a year, I'll stand corrected.  I highly doubt they will.
We'll see, but my bet is on classic going the way of XT and Mike Hearn, wandering off into insignificance.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:39:32
By your standard then explain what the 91% represents, and it's use in the "bar chart" at the top of the page.
coin.dance/poli is clearly implying that both categories indicate "support" as in their vote.  I can only assume that when they do their verification with the individuals and organizations that those terms are well understood.
You're going to have to present more data if you'd like to convince people otherwise.
Edit: To support your definition you'd have to also explain why there are 0 in the category that both support SegWit politically and also support it in their code.  There would need to be a separate category and/or color code for that for your definitions to hold unless of course you think none of the groups that have implemented SegWit actually support it politically, which would be absurd to suggest.

Flying rainbow unicorns are also plausible (pterodactyl, iguana, narwhal), just unlikely.  In this case it's clear that the large majority of Classic nodes are XT/Unlimited converts and brand new nodes, many at amazon. 
In case it wasn't clear, the "just as" part is what I take issue with.
If you'd like to make a better case for these folks firing up classic nodes "also", I'm all ears but it seems a bit more like denial that classic is doomed to fail, as it should be. 
The nice part, time will tell and we can revisit this conversation.  In the meantime maybe you should take a waltz through the "quality" comments in and with a little critical thinking you'll likely come to the same conclusion.  It seems as if nobody is talking about conversions except in the context of the fact that they can't explain why the core nodes are still holding strong.

I  see what you mean.  I spoke to some of that (with no authority whatsoever, just thinking out loud) that perhaps in cases where a quality or other similar issue could arise, this system might force more accurately describing the product up front thereby lowering the occurrence of the issue in the first place while at the same time leading to higher quality listings and more predictable outcomes.  I don't claim to know enough about the game dynamics involved or the complexities that could arise but it's interesting to think about.  It would seem somewhat intuitive that sometimes having fewer options could lead to better outcomes as it reduces the set of possible outcomes.

While that's a true statement, it's not all encompassing.  We don't know that as soon as that kind of increase was official (as I said scheduled for a month ago, not a taper to 8MB but immediate 8MB) that the network might not have been immediately spammed, potentially even up to the 8MB limit.
You are playing semantic games as it also should be clear to anyone that the OP was not just concerned about full 8MB blocks but larger blocks in general that might accompany a significant increase in the cap.
Changing his statement to "just imagine if we had Gavin’s **up to** 8MB blocks" still maintains the spirit of his concern.
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:25:07
So you're saying an intentional split (advertise it) and choose your software vs. attempting to keep it together and then potentially unintentionally split?
I never really thought about that.  Interesting idea.
I don't think the discussion is stuck as I think both sides move toward each other as more ideas are discussed.  I see Luke Jr. and Jeff Garzik have both proposed some interim fixes.  Not that I understand them enough to evaluate them, but ideas are happening in real time.  This seems really healthy.  Also I think Gavin came down from his fixed 20MB stop-gap number to the growing over time concept.  I see those as signs we're coming together and that the pool of ideas can add significant value.  As the stress test has dragged out I think that has helped the discussion and to drive motivation too.
I also think as many have suggested, that once a reasonable solution (even if not a consensus solution) is reached, most opposition will cave and unify.

The chart I cited (different than Theymos') makes it clear the daily cyclic range of core nodes and how that has not significantly changed from its range of 4800 to 5100.
How about you make any reasonable assertion how that can be the case if classic isn't just firing up new nodes and cannibalizing the few XT and Unlimited nodes?  Seems like the chart tells a very clear story.  You should have the burden of proof to show how something else could possibly explain that chart.

Not to float my own boat, and it's not an exact match, but I had an argument about the "morality" of this type of private motivation 12 days ago.  It also was not likely the reference you saw as I doubt anyone other than the redditor I was responding to saw it.
Having a supposedly good faith public argument on technical merits while privately simply attempting to protecting your secret advantage is IMO dishonest and immoral.  Bitcoin, despite it's technologically anti-fragile nature is not immune to these real life political attacks.  Having great developers like Greg Maxwell that can ferret out these secret motivations is what helps make Bitcoin anti-fragile to political attacks.  Having the best developers should definitely not be taken for granted.

I'll assume you're not trolling.
Groups or pools?  Pools are made up of individuals.  Antpool for example has individuals mining using their pool.  If they go rogue the individual miners can switch to a pool they prefer.  This has already been demonstrated in the past.
While currently the community has relied on updates from the core devs, if you haven't noticed there is some fracturing, see Bitcoin XT, which demonstrates how code can be deployed by nodes, miners and users can install whatever version of the software they want, even their own, similar to a voting mechanism.  Sounds pretty decentralized to me.  Have any suggestions how to improve upon that or can you point to a similar system that is more decentralized?

"10. Privacy
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the
parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending
an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is
similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of
individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were."

How did they take your bitcoin?  I just did my 1st one, and it went very smoothly.  When you place an order the funds don't leave your account until someone agrees to place the order.  At that point the funds go into escrow and are not released until you confirm delivery.
Can you provide more details?
Also, I had an order accepted and then cancelled due to availability on Amazon changing, and used the contact support option.  Someone got to me within a short amount of time, under an hour.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think green "support" means as in "voting for" and the blue is "ready" as in "implemented or ready to deploy."  So I think you can take the blue 68% to mean "actual support" in the way I think you meant it.
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:41:46
Again, I may be misunderstanding you, but I think most people would include the "support with a vote" @ 23% + "support with code" @ 68% to indicate the overall "support" for SegWit, which is also why they are added together at coin.dance/poli.  I'm not sure why you are trying to look at only the 23%, but I may still be missing your point.
I think your "just ready" is perhaps the point of contention.  I think you're incorrectly assuming that means they are not putting their support behind SegWit, which I believe to be inaccurate.

In this particular case the details are especially interesting since the folks attending the seemingly ever expanding network of Mosques (remember, it's not an attack) tend to support a belief system that seems just fine with barbaric behavior that goes well beyond the supposed "hate crime" that was mentioned.

You know until recently many places that accept credit cards used to have minimum amounts they would run your card for.  As a matter of fact I ran into one just the other day with a $10 minimum.
Why do you think that is?
Small transactions have the same overhead as large ones.  Right now with bitcoin's current design and demand transactions are expensive since there is massive data and bandwidth redundancy.  With SegWit+LN those properties change bringing not only lower cost per transaction but elimination of that redundancy and as a bonus better privacy.
You'll have your coffee transactions, we just have to scale bitcoin intelligently because of it's increasing demand and current single layer design.

BS = spun up in the cloud to influence the count.  Nothing is absolute but it should be clear that what Classic needs is to convert Core nodes and they are not doing that.  In theory some could be people running Core deciding to also run Classic as has been suggested but it's pretty clear that would be a minority not "just as likely" as was also suggested.
The fact that we've only seen 1 Classic block also flies in the face to the bold claims they had made about miner buy-in.
At this stage you should probably acknowledge that Classic is not converting Core nodes, just XT and unlimited nodes and that most of it is by spinning them up now (why not before? Didn't they care about Bitcoin before?) and that in twice the proportion of Core nodes they are in the cloud rather than more safely hosted on people's own hardware.
You can continue to deny all this but nobody's being fooled except people with equal cognitive dissonance. 
Another prediction, when the Classic hostile hard fork attempt fails (which it will) the lion's share of their nodes will go poof while the Core nodes will stay in their range.
@_date: 2017-04-05 04:43:57
I think you may be missing the part where the nodes that really matter are the ones run by the services you want to use.  So for example if you want to buy something at a vendor that integrates BitPay the bitpay node will have to recognize the bitcoin you're using as valid.  Likewise with the ATM you want to use to withdraw some cash for a fiat purchase.

If someone were to introduce a bill called the "free speech" bill I'd have the same concerns. 
 Often these bills have a misrepresentation PR name, for example the "Affordable Care Act" which has seen massive price increases and despite claims we could keep our plans and doctors, that is generally not true.
Are you sure that you're not just buying the PR?
ISPs have an incentive to provide the service their customers want, and if they don't they leave holes for the free market to exploit.  Many times government, in the name of protecting people's interest, has instead created burdensome regulation which hurts smaller players and centralizes power with the larger players who have the resources to comply with those regulations (or who had a hand in drafting them specifically to give themselves an advantage).
Why would Bitcoin supporters support a money that derives value specifically because it is not controlled by government and then be welcoming of legislation that regulates the internet?
It's a real mystery to me.

You're merging different issues.
u/qs-btc suggested that only 23% actually supported SegWit (as in politically) which is patently absurd.
Regarding condensing a complex issue, you are assuming that there is not thought being put into the way the data is collected and presented.  Perhaps you should ask u/Coin-Dance before suggesting as much.
My bet is that in most every case "ready" indicates both political support and actual code support, while "support" means political in which case the code is likely not ready yet.

[replied to your comment and provided more information](  I would assume you've now got the answer to why your fees were not estimated correctly and it's either that armory wasn't able to correctly estimate them (armory's fault, not the bitcoin network as a whole nor specifically a block size issue), or perhaps you had it configured incorrectly (same applies).


Your transaction was, I believe **150x** the size of the average transaction, included many party multi-sig too correct?  Are you suggesting that if the block size was increased that the fees for a transaction such as the one in question would be significantly different?  I don't think that has been established as some fees would presumably still be required, certainly for large transactions as the halving is coming.   A 150x average size transaction would still presumably not be free and may still be substantial as the network does need to pay for it's own security.  90kb is after all a substantial chunk of even a 2Mb block (~4.5% of it).  So that is the first reason to redact it.
Also, what would this transaction have cost you at a bank?  Is it even possible?  What are the other possible alternatives and their associated costs?  I don't think $6 for what you are doing is a game changer or even remotely unreasonable but I'd love to hear your perspective on it.  If there are no practical alternates that is a 2nd reason to redact the claims.
My main beef: your post was alarmist and sensationalist.  You clearly didn't know how to estimate fees nor did you pick a wallet (or have it configured correctly) to properly estimate them for you so you over estimated them.  Then you seemingly presented it as if it was a normal transaction, not something incredibly unique and as if the sky was therefore falling: 
["Here's a transaction with a ten-dollar transaction fee. **This the bitcoin you want? Cause this the bitcoin you have now.** (More in comments)"](
I think the spirit of that post, in light of the discussion, the recent revelations about calculating fees. alternate wallets that do estimate fees better, the specifics of your transaction and your interaction with Armory support, begs a formal redaction or at least clarification.  Considering the crowd jumped all over it in their echo chamber I would think you'd want them and other newcomers to bitcoin to have the most accurate information possible.  It's the responsible thing to do to help people more accurately understand this historically important technology especially in light of the very heated and important debate that is and was going on at the time of your post.
I expect posts like yours in but not from someone like you that seems so centered and rational.  Your post could have easily been presented in the form of a question rather than an emotional call to arms and I would have had no problem with it and would have helped to the degree I am equipped to provide help (as I did after first responding in kind).  I would hope you can see the significance of the difference in presentation.

Btw, I was talking about the kind where only the full amount could be spent and not split for example.  Anyway, not complaining just looking forward to it, and the idea of protection with absolutely no third party seems like it could be amazing.  I realize I'm feature creeping though ;).

The DNA for flying rainbow unicorns exists, so it is plausible, just not likely - which was my point.


I have, I supplied a [link]( and it's clear to see that the Core nodes are very stable while the classic nodes are ramping up despite Core being stable, so they are new (and "converts" from XT and Unlimited).


Yup.  And if everyone was like you then it would be "just as likely" but that's not likely.


Maybe, but the fact that there have only been 2 classic blocks mined in 12 days and 1 was a test by Antminer apparently to hedge just in case (prudent for sure), is a pretty clear indicator.  Also those amazon boxes will start to get expensive and turn off over time.  We can already [see the classic node count dipping off it's peak](  Factoring in the failure of XT, the haphazard behavior of 2 of the main XT/classic "devs", the empty and exaggerated miner support claims, the fact that [40% of classic nodes are at datacenters]( and more than that are new (as in not previously supporting the network), I think my prediction is pretty solid.  
I'm open to hearing your counter arguments though.  So far your one argument seems weak based on the fact that proof by example with a sample size of 1 as you noted.  If that's all you've got perhaps you should consider that you've got this thing incorrectly assessed.

You need to do more research into the history of money.
Credit cards took over 50 years to fully penetrate the Western world.  In my lifetime they used to have to make an impression on carbon paper and call the credit card company on the phone, which was at each register, to check if there was credit available.
There's little evidence to make broad assumptions as you do.  Here's another example, most people to this day cannot attach more than a 20MB file attachment to an email and have to use convoluted bolt on services.

For the true "support politically" to be only 23% as was suggested it would mean that in **every single instance** where SegWit was implemented so that they were "ready" they **only did it** to be ready while not supporting it politically.

So Olivier is concerned with fees but wants to eliminate the incentive for a fee market despite the halving being very near.

I have a serious question for you since we obviously have bitcoin in common which is quite a big thing when you think about how few people are in it at this stage.
How is enforcing legal immigration comparable to isolationism?  The way I see it there are 7 billion people on the earth and at least a few billion reported to be living on the equivalent of $1.50 per day.  We have a population of roughly 300 million and we can't seem to balance the books.  If people continue to rush across the border in the hundreds of thousands or millions a year and to reproduce, and to tap our socialist policies, do you think the end result will be positive?
I've also heard of many cases where we can't even identify people for lack of paperwork and there are repeat offending violent criminals who are deported only to return and commit more crime.

Please be more specific regarding toxic or hostile behavior.  I was asking him specific questions and he eluded.  If you didn't notice most of the comments in that thread were negative except for the clear shills that got downvoted into oblivion.  There were plenty of other people greeting him with negativity and skepticism.  This was also not my first run in with the guy and last time questions and constructive criticism were met with a dismissive and superior attitude - the likes of "who the hell are you?".  I've witnessed him treating others in exactly the same way.  It seems to be his MO.  If one would like to contribute, and are presumably doing self promotion to garner interest, you better be prepared to answer tough questions.
Do you disagree he was using shill accounts?  I have one reddit account and almost exclusively post to and for a time was very active - bordering on too active and mostly post positive comments (peruse my history if you suggest otherwise).  I've been busier lately and have not had the time to comment as much.
Also, if you haven't noticed, he never came back with Part 2 which he suggested would fill in the gaps of his new supposedly amazing technology.  So history is proving me and the other skeptics right.  
Btw, he was suggesting bitcoin based IDs via facial recognition so I think it only prudent to get some answers to important privacy related questions.  In this case though I think he was just full of s**t.  He could not make the connection as to how one could identify the person and their account without having a local identity database.

@_date: 2016-09-05 03:56:55
All due respect to Cato, there are multiple problems with the criticism presented in that piece:
1. No reference to "illegals", lumping all immigrants together or not including illegal immigration at all.
2. This argument makes no sense to me.  Perhaps you can explain:
"The second issue with the CIS report is that it does not correct for income. Since means-tested welfare programs are designed for those with lower incomes, it makes sense to only compare use rates among those with lower incomes. It is not enlightening to statistically compare the welfare use rates of rich immigrants and Americans like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett to poorer immigrants and Americans as the CIS report does."
3. They make strange comparisons like this:
"It turns out that when poor immigrants use welfare they consume a lower dollar value than poor natives do.  For poor adult Medicaid enrollees, natives consumed $3845 of benefits in 2010 compared to $2904 for immigrants."
This is a misdirection.  "When they do" seems to only be part of the equation and they provide no numbers.  Where do they discuss what % of natives vs. immigrants use the programs in the first place?
4. From their cited publication:  titled "Poor Immigrants Use Public Benefits at a Lower Rate than Poor Native-Born Citizens".  Think about this argument even if it is true.  The argument seems to be poor immigrants use less welfare than poor Native-born Americans.  Do you see the flaw if we are speaking about illegal immigrants?  These people are taking benefits but are not legal citizens.  It doesn't matter what rate with which they take benefits, it matters that they are taking benefits and are here illegally.  At that point you should also be considering other benefits not considered to be programs, for example education.  If their anchor-babies are going to public schools that's another huge draw on public funds.
Cato seems to be advocating at a philosophical level rather than a practical one.   If our system was more libertarian and less socialized this issue would be less of a concern.  But opening the floodgates to as many illegal immigrants as can get here is clearly not a policy that is sustainable in a system that has numerous social programs that illegals can tap.
I notice the Cato piece didn't bring up the jobless rate, under the table employment etc.  I think they are on the wrong side of this one.

That seems like an illogical leap.  How'd you get there?  Adoption is up = good, right?


"Raged"?  It's admittedly more complex as it QuickSort.  It would be absurd to chose Bubble sort over QuickSort despite it's added complexity.  Did you miss that part?


No, it's a way of saying that you obviously don't understand complexity.  There will be more space available for more transactions as SegWit transactions increase which is [already happening ]( just a few weeks after activation up to a doubling of the raw block space.  As I already mentioned and you conveniently didn't reply to, the average user doesn't need to know this.


Again "raged"?  This is an invalid and impotent argument technique as is putting other words in my mouth like "stupid", "bloody" etc.  Resorting to these tactics is a tell that you can't make an actual counter-argument.  I went into the detail of the main issues already.


I did go into them.  Increasing bandwidth and CPU requirements on nodes by quadrupling or removing the limit altogether clearly increases the costs on running nodes.  What's not factual about that?




He seems to be implying that it's OK to utilize resources that would require $20,000 nodes.  Do you "heavily agree" with that?  Do you not see that would clearly reduce the number and diversity of nodes?


Are you including serving historical blocks?


What's to stop 8mb blocks from being spammed earlier than when they are "needed"?


Perhaps you can clarify what this means.


What data are you using to come to the conclusion that adoption is being choked?  Coinbase is currently looking at 1 million new members per month.




If you can't read, I can't help you.  Cell phones were a "rich man's tool" just a decade before costs were reduced **via scale** to tens of dollars per phone and per month.


Ah, it's becoming clear now.  Your vision is the classic liberal vision where you get to decide how other people spend their money.


"Again?" Maybe you don't want to scale to billions of users and you're certainly entitled to that opinion.  I'm pretty sure most of the community, especially the rbtc community, has aspirations of reaching billions of users.  At least you have the decency to indirectly indicate that the block size will not singularly scale anywhere close to that.


That's about the worst analogy I've ever seen used.  In fact I can't even understand what your intent was.
Scaling via improving algorithms and protocols before other more costly methods (vertical scale with more powerful CPUs and horizontal scale by adding more hardware) is an industry standard approach.

Keep doing what you're doing if it works for you.
Regarding zero sum game, are stocks a zero sum game?  Was the internet a zero sum game?  Bitcoin and crypto-currencies at large are platforms for innovation that are worth something because they offer new utility that was not available before.  See what's happening in Venezuela where people are looking for ways to protect their wealth and then tell me it's a zero sum game.
Option 1. Spend your money as fast as possible before it inflates by double digits.
Option 2. Buy Bitcoin where you can avoid the one way inflation.

Search the OP for "user"/"users".  Vinny is operating under the false assumption that someone other than the users are the economic majority.  His ideas are based on that incredibly faulty premise.  He may be trying to help, but without understanding and respecting that basic fact he's missing the most important point.  If Bitcoin can be railroaded by a cabal it lost its most important value propositions, anti-fragility and rule by consensus.  The thing about rule by consensus is that you can't avoid it because the consent of the dissenters will simply be removed along with their economic contribution.
This is the people's currency, not the corporations' nor the miners'.  Fiat 2.0 was not the goal and most investors (time and money) understand that basic fact and will react accordingly.

You must be new here.  Bitcoin is beta software that has massive adoption.  We are in the midst of multiple scaling solutions which theoretically will lead to very low fees likely capable of supporting true micro transactions.

Are you 12 years old by any chance?  You seem to be operating on emotion, not rationality.
How does the fact that SegWit is more complex have anything to do with anything?  I acknowledge from the outset that it adds complexity, but so do many optimizations in computer science.  The fact that every user doesn't understand it has absolutely no relevance.  You seem to want to fixate on this as if since there is added complexity that validates all your other irrational arguments.  It doesn't.  The internet is complex, our mobile phones are complex, computers are complex.  Something being complex does not mean it is the wrong solution.  Try again.


Classic logic failure.  You only know the train that hit you and not the one that missed you.  True failure would have been Bitcoin losing it's primary value proposition is a permissionless censorship resistant network for wealth storage and transfer.  If quadrupling value and massive user adoption is failure then you better redefine terms and reexamine your position.  BCH on the other hand looks like a massive failure.


That's nice. So where does it mention latency, orphan rates and TOR?




This does not jive with my personal experience.  It took over a month for 4 vCPUs on my 3.4 GHz Intel i7-4930K to sync the block chain start to finish and bandwidth nor storage were bottlenecks in my case.


So potentially thousands or more transactions in the space of 2 on-chain transactions is "not so much" to you?  This is an indefensible position.


Fixating on one metric is a useless exercise.  It would be equivalent to only looking at the share volume of GOOG traded and not looking at the price.


You are apparently making causal assumptions that I don't think you can support.  The two products are very different from one another and offer different utility.  Besides that, it's good that alts are growing.  The community is drawing more interest from conventional investors which is a positive thing.


Once again this is a false argument and false characterization.  The capacity was not restricted because of these other systems, the capacity was restricted for security, the single most important value proposition of this network.  LN exists and is being tested at this very moment.  There have already been successful LN transactions.  What's not quite ready is the polish but I predict that will be very soon.  In case you haven't noticed, your choking claims fall flat while 5% from an ATH with an essentially empty mempool.


Again, it's not being cut, the network is growing despite a cap on transaction capacity (put there by Satoshi specifically to protect the network from spam).  It's hard to entertain that anything is being cut while 5% from an ATH reached just a week ago. Calling LN imaginary is also not in good faith so you should probably stop doing it. LN has 6 different teams working on interoperable implementations and as mentioned LN transactions on the actual bitcoin network have already been executed.  Bitcoin itself is still considered beta software.  You are a beta tester complaining that the system doesn't work perfectly.  The answer is "yet".
The other reason for not "simply" hard forking to increase the block size, I already discussed.  The risks of the precedent that could embolden regulators to force a contentious hard fork with restrictive features, essentially ruining bitcoin.


OK, so I didn't understand your analogy because of the word "flies".  So it's a language issue.  I think you meant "airplanes."  (in English "flies" are small insects with wings).
Now that I understand your analogy I can respond. I don't see how you got from quotas on land based transportation logically resulting in "that we never got airplanes".  So I think it's not a great analogy.


So you think that since this new technology that offers people the option to securely store wealth without a bank (which can separate you from your money or reject you altogether at whim of the state) currently sometimes has high fees (during times of high demand) that people will start to make a one way move to Paypal, a 20 year old system that existed prior to Bitcoin?  That seems completely irrational. As for moving to alts, this is most definitely happening and I can see why people see it as a problem.  That said I disagree:
1. It's healthy to allow alts to develop for the good of the community and the tech (see multi-headed hydra).
2. Alts will have to stand the test of time and withstand the test of security.  Those that do will make the community stronger.  Those that don't will teach important lessons to those that made the move.
3. Alts will have to overcome Bitcoin's adoption, and if one can I don't see why that's necessarily a bad thing.  Competition is good as it spurs innovation.
4. Alts will have to overcome Bitcoin's multiple network effects, which will be hard to do.  If they do, more power to them.  They will have done a better job and therefore earned their popularity.
Also, this risk has always been there.  It's hard being   You have to fight all the battles and then others can follow the trail you blazed.  In this case, for example SegWit and LN were created for Bitcoin and then adopted by various alts.  It's the nature of the beast.  Some people will see the value in sticking with  and some may leave.  Panicking every time there's a move in the Bitcoin Dominance Index seems unnecessarily reactionary and especially silly when we are continuing to achieve new ATHs every month or so. Cheer up, relax, and enjoy the drum beat of technological progress.


!RemindMe in 6 months to revisit that prediction.


It was the one analogy you brought forward that was at all relatable to Bitcoin.  It seems you didn't like where it went.  Perhaps you should check your perspective rather than discount your own analogy.

@_date: 2017-09-27 14:27:59


I hadn't thought about this point before.  If you also consider the lack of updates and the "it's done why would development continue" attitude, I'm wondering if we can imply what will happen in the future.  Maybe this is all just a tactic and as we get closer to November these companies will individually bow out.
S2x started as a face saving measure for miners.  Maybe over time they'll each back away citing "serious doubts from the community" and that will be the face saving measure of the remaining participants.  They just can't do it too early or a possible response could be proposed.
This may sound far fetched but now I'm hoping this is the case.  Time will tell.
Nevertheless I agree people should keep pressure on those parties.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:26:42
First, I was asking if you were joking as it's pretty clear you meant to imply the community at large by using "majority of us".  At least you had the decency to dial that back when called out.


I support Bitcoin and the concept of rule by concensus, not by a cabal of corporations and miners who meet in private and decide the direction that works best for them.  We have that already with FedCoin and other fiat currencies.  As for 2x, while in the longer term there may be a need to expand the raw blocksize, SegWit and other L2 scaling solutions have not been given enough time to be able to accurately predict their effectiveness.  Scale not requiring a big boost in resources is generally preferable to scale that requires it.  Compounding that is that a block size increase on top of SegWit is like a double hit on the network resources.
As a developer, I have a foundation in understanding scale and the complexities associated with different scaling methods. The proposed layered approach to scale is consistent with that of the internet and allows rolling upgrades rather than forcing all nodes onto new software simultaneously.  It also ensures insulation of the base layer from problems or attack vectors on the higher layers.  It also generally means greater stability.  Security (as in protection from attack by anyone but most importantly governments) and stability are Bitcoin's primary value propositions.
Then there's the lack of development on the s2x code base, the ridiculously short timing for testing and the idea that the folks who have maintained the Bitcoin network for the past few years almost unanimously disagree it's the right solution.  There is a reason that the majority of nodes run Core code.  It's a meritocracy.
Care to share your thoughts?
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:01:35
I understand your arguments but Vinny didn't even include users in his "3 legged stool" analogy.  I think your 2nd quote was not his position as much as it was a hypothetical perspective.


Because it indicates that their arguments and appeals to not destroy bitcoin (best possible outcome) are working on even those that were misguided enough to join the NYA. IMO the best possible outcome is if each of these companies fall like dominoes before November.  If/as they each fall I think we'll see positive price feedback as uncertainty diminishes.


Regardless of the number of companies and services in the space, if 50% of users migrated to another coin what do you think would happen?  Consider too that the ones that would likely migrate would be those doing so on principle, not the weak hand late comers looking to make it big quick.  Also, the developers will clearly leave, taking all their expertise with them.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:58:04

Perhaps he got a little rattled at the scrutiny of reddit users (myself included) as opposed to the unconditional praise of his uninformed fanbois on youtube.
It was pretty sure he was using shill accounts to defend himself and discourage open discussion of his ideas.  If you notice, many of his defenders had very limited reddit history outside of defending him on that very thread.  It seems like that's pretty much the last time his account has been seen on reddit.

Why deal with coins?  The LN paper trail is much less permanent than with on chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:54:31
Wouldn't it also make sense from the perspective that the attack would be more costly if less pools were involved?  What I mean is that if say just 1 pool was responsible, wouldn't they be at a disadvantage relative to other pools since creation of spam blocks likely takes longer?  If this were an issue then collusion allows more spam while keeping the relative ratios more constant, so essentially muting the costs of the attack.
I certainly could be wrong about the cost to miners of spam blocks.  Please correct me if you know.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:57:30

What is your understanding of what the "small blocker" position is?
To answer your question, the concern is resilience from the inevitable government/central banking attack.  It will likely require maximum regional node diversity and perhaps the ability to run over TOR or other anonymizing service.  It will also likely need to support the threat of POW change.  The ability to withstand these attacks should be overwhelming in order to discourage the attack in the first place.  This is also why I hold the opinion that a strong alt coin market is a good thing.
In short, security trumps adoption.  With security and time will come scale and adoption.  Without security all we have is a clunky Paypal.  Want big blocks?  Use BCH.  Want low fees?  Use an alt.  Want secure wealth storage and transfer in L1 so we can innovate permissionlessly on top of L1, as we did with the internet?  Use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:28:05
Juke-Jr floated the POW change a while ago (6 months or more?).  I don't think that was reactive.  Seems more likely to be proactive.  We are now starting to see what he saw back then.  If the miners united behind a contentious proposal, it may be the only appropriate response.  And like a cold war, the threat may be enough to prevent the attack.  It all remains to be seen over the next month or so.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:24:26
It appears you seem to believe that the number of words you write somehow helps your argument.  It doesn't and it doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin's mining process is much more like gold extraction than the processes through which central banks create fiat.  Fiat is mostly created on demand and independent of all of the costs related to the banking system. 
Focus on this point: **It is undeniable fact that the Bitcoin monetary production rate is fixed while for fiat it is not and is up to the whim of central bankers.**
You've written volumes to try to disguise the fact that you misrepresented that fact and no Carl Sagan quote will save you from it.

@_date: 2017-09-12 16:13:16
When people speak of approaching 100% adoption, it would seem more important to look at TXs not UTXOs.  There are likely many UTXOs that will never move due to loss of their keys, or seldom move due to the their use as long term investments.  What matters is what mix of them are seen moving.  That number is clearly seeing solid growth.  As more exchanges come online with SegWit we should see large jumps.

@_date: 2017-09-17 05:05:10
My best advice, keep your finger on the pulse.  If people don't start falling away from 2x support quickly by then I don't see a happy ending.
Diversification would seem wise.
It seems [the developers overwhelmingly are against Segwit2x]( as are [many of the companies/products in the community] ( and [nodes as we see Satoshi:0.15.0 quickly climbing the ranks]( but it seems as if [miners are still not flinching](
Seems like a game of chicken and I don't see the former parties backing down.  The latter risks being the bag holders of hundreds of millions of dollars in hardware if the community simply jumps chains which they all can do (and likely are slowly doing to hedge their bets).  I would think that means the miners will flinch first, but I could certainly be wrong.
I'm happy to learn about other opinions and to be convinced I'm not seeing/thinking straight.
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:25:37
Sounds like BCH and you see how well that's working out.  Even if they had all the mining power they don't have the users.

Straw man.  I said "generally caused by spam attacks".  And look at the mempool: 


How's 3 months sound?  In my estimation that is more like it.  As mentioned there have already been LN transactions on the live network.  What seems to being worked out now is interoperability between implementations and and user friendliness.

@_date: 2017-09-05 02:56:35
Yes, off the top of my head:
1. "Rising fees is slowing adoption and causing users to move to other coins."  See "slipping market share" (nevermind the growth in market cap)
2. "Segwit" is too complicated, stick with whats worked for years (nevermind the concept that things eventually have to scale - see facebook)
3. "Disk space is cheap" (nevermind that disk space is not the primary, secondary or even tertiary issue)
4. "Bandwidth is cheap" (what's this upstream bandwidth thing?)
5. "Only businesses need to run nodes" (nevermind that in order to not require a trusted third party (see white paper) you must run your own node)
6. "But coffee!" (nevermind that there are many very usable acceptable options already in place that will remain superior to Bitcoin for small recurring, non-controversial transactions for at least a few years)
There's more, and we understand them, and unlike them we understand why there are more important existential issues. First and foremost is that Bitcoin will be attacked and when it's attacked it will need massive distribution, like BitTorrent.  Requiring "$20,000" nodes necessarily limits that distribution and likely puts most within the reach of regulatory capture.

Get your facts consistent.
I'm not sure why you're being such an apologist for Antpool. I don't know their justification or plan, but the fact is they are more responsible for empty blocks over the past 3 years than the other big miners.  AsicBoost may or may not have had something to do with it, and SegWit eliminating public AsicBoost may or may not have had something to do with it.  You don't know any better than me, but the basic facts are the same.  They claim Bitcoin doesn't scale due to small block size and then they've squandered it with 0 TX blocks and essentially stolen the block reward more than anyone else.
You're arguing on the wrong side, but feel free to keep doing.  Your futile persistence is at the very least entertaining.

To play devil's advocate with my own position, I also see pressure to ride it out as the opportunity cost of switching chains is high.  If things go well or at least not badly we "may" (replay protection wildcard) still effectively be holding the keys to 2 valuable coins.  If you switch chains that's not the case (unless you do it post-fork and choose wisely which may be hard until the dust settles).
Just my opinion: 
I think Litecoin will have big win vs. small to medium loss potential for Bitcoin disaster/success scenarios respectively.
I think privacy coins will likely behave similarly.
ETH, who knows.  There are enough new people in this space that may blindly hedge to " so maybe it will be the same but somewhat magnified vs. the others.
The thing I wonder about is if this event can break the often seen correlation downwards between Bitcoin and the rest of the market.  If not, it's hard to see how the different factors will all interplay.
Honestly though, it's like the singularity.  I don't think anyone can truly predict what will happen.  That's why I think diversification is probably the safest play.  The next month will help determine the specifics of my plan, the weights etc.
I wish the SW2X crowd would see that their agreement (of a small set of parties) is completely disconnected from the ideology of this system.  Back room deals are the exact opposite of consensus based.
I think the concept of a block size increase could even be accepted if time were allowed for SW to really kick in and for at least a few months post LN traction.  Then the community would likely be more unified having more data.

BTC Transactions last 24h: 229,336
BCH Transactions last 24h: 7,034
So BTC is processing more transactions per day, but let's not hold that against BCH.  It's not BCH's fault that there are so few people that want to use it.
In terms of first confirmation times, it's hard to find a good source, but this chart  seems to indicate that in the last month there have been 3 periods of about 18 hours when there were less than 1 BCH block per hour.  During those times it was also possible that a medium sized pool could have rewritten the previous couple BCH blocks wreaking havoc.  Good thing nobody chose to do that.
So it seems fair to call this one a draw.


BTC Transaction fees: low  
BCH Transaction fees: let's say 0
BCH win.?. OK let's call that a win, but bitcoin fees have been getting lower on average.


Aug 22:
BTC: $4078 (high of the day)
BCH: $585 (low of the day)
Right now: 
BTC: $3682 (down 9.7%)
BCH: $413 (down 29%)
Clear winner here.

I think you've unnecessarily complicated the conversation and also introduced FUD, albeit possibly unintentionally.
There is really no valid comparison you can make between how the fed creates money and how it is created in the Bitcoin universe.  I think you should revise your previous comments to reflect that as not to mislead people who may not know better.
As expensive as it may be to print the tiny % of paper based fiat, it's nothing like the costs required to produce bitcoin, which despite centralization is still a very competitive endeavor with enforced rules and that cannot exceed (over more than very short time frames) the inflation chart I linked.
You've convoluted the entire discussion to avoid conceding that point.  Moreover, you've apparently built much of your discussion points on that flawed foundation.

This is a horrible excuse for an argument.  Capacity is being expanded safely while L1 is being secured from attack.


They can't destroy mining in general, only centralized miners.  Current exchanges are a stop-gap for mass adoption.  Bitcoin existed and grew before and will continue to exist if all centralized exchanges are eliminated.  It's near impossible to stop person to person exchange - see the drug trade.


No.  We could switch to X11, Scrypt, for which there is already mining power.


Spam attacks, centralization attacks, nationalization of miners by governments.  The resistance to each of these attacks is weakened with bigger blocks.


See prior answer.


It is generally accepted to refer to "Paypal" as a government compliant and controlled payment system.  Perhaps you haven't yet run into that?  If Bitcoin becomes centralized and therefore open to regulatory attack it will have zero advantage over Paypal and will have lost it's entire value proposition.


Bigger blocks cause higher orphan rates and increase miner centralization.  With miners centralized within the GFWoC (already a problem in terms of potential collusion) where they can potentially be nationalized by the communist Chinese government (who has a real motivation to stop capital flight - do your own research on both nationalization, missing CEOs and capital controls) there is a real risk to a takeover of the network.  With smaller blocks the risk is smaller as miners outside the GFWoC can continue to compete.
Bigger blocks/lower fees also impose higher costs on the decentralized nodes via spam attacks.  With your "lower fees" and more block space spammers can fill more space for less cost and the entirety of the network will have to carry those extra costs (bw, CPU, storage) at the time of creation and in perpetuity (current nodes: storage and some bw. future nodes: bw, CPU and storage).




It's not a command and this is another sad excuse for an argument.  I clearly have no power to make you do anything.  The fact remains that there is a coin that does exactly what you want so rather than try to change the side of the fork that rejected the block size increase, perhaps you'd be happier if you just use the side that aligns with your beliefs.  It seems you want to make shitty decisions that result in a shitty coin, but you also want the benefit of the value that was created and protected by those on the smart side of the decision - you know, where all the market participants remain.  If your ideas were good the BCH fork would be thriving right now, but it is not.  Even your precious big block miners have all but abandoned it.  The market is telling you which is the right answer but you refuse to listen.


See 2 comments up.




It's only slow because many transactions that could happen off chain are currently happening on-chain.  LN will move many transactions off chain.


Correct.  It is restricted to protect the network, not to enable L2.


BCH specifically removed SegWit and did not replace it with even a fix for the tx maleability problem which is why it doesn't currently support LN while the real Bitcoin does.


No, they are based on the reality that with large blocks comes higher cost of running nodes, higher risk of spam attacks, higher risk of mining centralization, higher risk therfore of that centralization being captured and used by governments.
With a hard fork (especially a contentious one) also comes the risk that it sets a precedent that Bitcoin can be changed and the entire network "upgraded" to support new rules.  This can be used in the future to force blacklisting, AML/KYC into the code, etc.
Btw, in case you hadn't heard, "the core developers" did not add the 1MB restriction.  Satoshi did.  He was probably trying to stunt the growth of his own creation, was he?

This is obvious but I think we should make it more public that the majority of support is coming from DCG companies.  If the NYA isn't seen as bad because there are only 45 companies supporting it perhaps it will be seen as bad that it's really 32 DCG companies and 13 others.  
That seems very centralized, especially when you see that the developers [overwhelmingly reject s2x]( and node support for v0.15+ which rejects s2x nodes [is cranking up](
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:22:38


Apparently it's convenient for you to ignore SegWit and LN.  Ignoring those developments invalidates your argument.


Who needs to estimate capacity?  You? An average user?  Perhaps a wallet developer, that's about it.  They deal in complexity every day.  Your fixation on complexity as if it matters is amazing to me.  You know what else is complex?  TCP/IP.  I'd say 95% of internet users don't even know what it is.


This is an invalid question. There is no standard CPU that is being used for nodes so there is no known "limit" we can just calculate.  A better way to think about it in a diverse system is relative to magnitudes.  If we double the number of transactions and assuming doubling the signature verifications, we'd also be doubling the CPU usage/requirements (paralellism, multi-cores etc. can affect measurement in time but for the sake of pure CPU utilization we can defer on that).  I think you'd have much less objection to a slow growth of resources (aside from the down sides of a hard fork) but for some reason it's always a doubling, quadrupling or even no set limit (implying a brand new attack surface and a new form of "emergent" consensus).  A production network worth tens of billions that is a force for freedom is no place for experimentation.


"Can" or "Can't"?  If you really mean "can" I think you've picked the wrong project to be involved in.


Yeah?  What's the real cost to an organization that can print it's own money like the fed?  Despite what you may think, it appears this has been happening regularly: 


I agree but I'm guessing most of your compatriots in rbtc don't agree.  The "coffee" meme didn't write itself.


How in good faith can you make such a claim?  Look at this chart and you can see that the amount of fiat money's worth of value (yes the world almost entirely still values wealth in fiat units) has been increasing tremendously:   .  Have you not considered that perhaps it's not being choked and instead less transactions are required to move even a growing amount of wealth?  As long as the price increase keeps pace or outgrows the number of transactions that will be the case.  Also, have you accounted for the amount of transactions that are already happening on L2 at exchanges and merchant providers like BitPay which likely collectively do millions of transactions per day many which don't hit the chain and the ones that do on are aggregated?
Check out this chart:   For it to be choked there would have to be a lot more peak and a lot less valley.


Hosting Facebook was cheap at one point too, requiring just 1 computer?  


Yeah, that's how it works until you reach scale.  Which alt coin can you point to that has handled scale better than Bitcoin?


No, adoption grew so now we have to scale to grow.  And now both the attack surface and the reward has increased.  There wasn't much to protect in 2010.


That's precious.


I'm not telling them what to do anymore than someone suggesting a ferrari doesn't make sense to use as a cab.  Using an immutable ledger for coffee is unnecessary and will of course be more expensive than other solutions.  I didn't ban people from using it, I suggested it's not a good match with its feature set.


And you prove my point that you don't even know what the argument is on the other side.  We **do** want to cure the disease, we want to cure it first by fixing and improving the algorithms and protocols and then after that with vertical and possibly horizontal scale.


Sorry, this is another bad analogy.


We did not scale hard drives by continuing to double their physical size.  We did it with data density, fitting more in the same space (similar cost of materials).


This is a great analogy to dig into.  We did it by both increasing the number of lanes and increasing the capacity of cars (see buses), and by more efficiently using those roads (see google maps/ways - recent developments).  Ideally had we these new tools when most of our infrastructure was being designed and built we likely would have better mass transit.
Widening the road is comparable to the raw blocksize increase.  Using buses is comparable to SegWit, packing more transactions per square foot, and alternate routes is comparable L2, routing traffic selectively though the network rather than forcing it onto the main thoroughfare.  The difference is that SegWit+L2 is software and doesn't require the cost of acquiring fleets of buses and fueling them or the cost of putting up GPS satellites and buying smartphones.  Even ignoring that more lanes can lead to more accidents (crappy security parallel), if you were the fictional central traffic planner, in terms of sequencing these concepts which would you do first?
Regarding scale, perhaps you should also consider a better parallel, network to network.  The internet was designed with layers for security, stability and scale, and improved upon prior communications solutions in similar ways to SegWit+LN.  It is upgraded via local upgrades (not requiring network-wide upgrades as block size increase requires), and achieves massive scale and cost reduction over dedicated networks via packet switching/routing which also has the benefit of offering privacy (private LAN traffic that is not broadcast to the network at large - like LN routed transactions that never hit the blockchain).

This is a non-statement that only works out of context.  Read the emails and come up to speed.  Vinny stated clearly that Segwit2x was not about scaling but about wresting control from Core.  This is a corporate cabal fighting against a meritocracy.
Fact: sometimes compromise is not the right answer, because sometimes decisions are black and white.  If a cabal of corporations manages to force a 2x hard fork on the users (the most important leg of the stool - the consumers and key holders) then Bitcoin as designed will have ceased to exist.
What will likely happen if the cabal "succeeds" is users will vote with their feet, likely already hedging/diversifying, and the miners will be the ultimate bag holders with massively devalued hardware.
The good news is that crypto-currencies will survive. The bad news is that the one with all the network effect and interest will have been destroyed and the media will have a field day with it, setting back the progress of crytpo-currencies at large a few years.

I didn't. I mentioned my experiences which I will revisit with different settings to better get my head around it.


Neither of these statements is a fair representation.  LN is highly functional right now and could be used for recurring transactions between known parties. The routing side is also being tested right now.  Re: the capacity limit, again, it's absurd to say that while the mem pool is essentially empty.


I don't think you have data to support that opinion.


When being attacked by a state actor expense is not an issue.  I also don't think you have the information required to prove such a thing.  Filing up 8mb with 5sat/byte transactions would be as expensive as filling up 1mb at 40sat/byte, but you've filled up 8mb or some part thereof utilizing multiples of the network resources. With 1mb at least the fees more quickly get competitive.


Collusion among miners, who in the present case 70% of which all live in the same regulatory domain under a government that has a track record for nationalizing companies and kidnapping CEOs.


If the Chinese government were to take over 70% of the hash power, they could use all that hash power to disrupt the network.  One of the attack vectors is screwing with miners outside the region via retention of blocks to cause more orphans.  With smaller blocks this attack is less effective as smaller blocks are faster to verify.
You should stay away form absolutes like "never" and "nothing".


What does this mean and where's the logic to back your assertion?


Nothing, which also has no relevance.  A threat is still a threat that should be considered even if not exercised.  Look into the theories surrounding cold wars.  Generally a threat is more likely to become reality when there is an imbalance of power.  Ignorance of threats that "haven't happened" can lead to the action.


Same old story.


This intentional misrepresentation is transparent and pointless.  Be better than that.


Can you provide a fact based reason for it?  IIRC jtoomim did some testing that seemed to prove that even 4MB might not be safe.


So there is a concern about a spam attack on large blocks?  Imagine that.

I think what you may be missing is that there is more than processing power to a coin.  If processing power was all that mattered then right now there would be no other SHA256 coins, but there are.  That's the point of the tweet.
More accumulated difficulty doesn't mean that S2X is the new bitcoin, it just means that S2X has more accumulated difficulty.  Just like having more accumulated difficulty doesn't make BTC the new BCH, or S2X the new BCH.  What differentiates them is the validity rules - which is a point often left out when S2Xers try to lay claim to "Bitcoin".

I have a different question.  In hindsight, do you agree that it was imprudent to agree to support a hard fork date just a few months after Segwit activation since that would not allow ample time for:
1. Segwit adoption rate to show a trend line
2. LN adoption rate to show a trend line
3. For adequate test &lt;-- probably the most important
If not, why not?  If so, can't your position change with the benefit of time, unforeseen events, a surprise fork (BCH) for example, and/or newly acquired perspective, for example that a large part of the community sees a corporate agreement as a form of central non-voluntary coercion, which btw might also cause massive losses to their portfolios.
What I also find unfortunate is that the timing of the proposed fork will muddy the waters in terms of how effective Segwit and perhaps LN are, which are important metrics when it comes to helping to fight the rampant FUD that's been thrown around dividing the community (from both sides).  If Segwit does improve fees for example that's an important data point to combat the anti-segwit philosophy (and those who spread it it) and perhaps more importantly restore faith in the wisdom of the Bitcoin Core developers and bring more skepticism to those that slandered them.  If not, then big blockers can claim a data backed win for their philosophy and perhaps the position of the Core developers will change to acknowledge that.
Without ample time the philosophies will likely still remain divided, each side claiming without ample data that their approach was best and continuing to sling mud.  This would be like A-B testing without marking down the results.  It's wasteful and will likely carry a legacy into the future of Bitcoin governance.

"Almost nobody" would be more equivalent to "pretty much everyone" in terms of common usage. "Nobody" means not even 1 person.

Erik, you're better than that.  This is your opinion and not objective reality.
Giving credit to the miners for signaling Segwit would be like giving a politician credit for coming clean about some scandal that they were forced to come clean about with an impending deadline looming where some truth was threatened to be exposed.  The dates were picked for a specific reason and could have been chosen to be post Aug 1, but were not.
Can you please explain your thoughts on these:
1. Why you think that what will very likely result in massive user confusion is not an issue.  Remember that we are seeing a huge number of new users each month, who likely will not understand the history and implications or even be aware of the 2 "Bitcoins".  What I mean here is that in all likelihood people will be sold "Bitcoin" that is arguably not the same "Bitcoin" that existed before the fork.  It's also possible that some services will accept "BitCore" and some "B2X", both claiming to be "Bitcoin" causing spends on the wrong chains and therefore the potential for funds loss in addition to the obvious confusion.
2. Why you think that if a successful hard fork is achieved by a small group of well known business leaders, that will NOT result in the potential for the governments to exert pressure on those very same people to mandate features like black listing/KYC etc. directly into the code?
3. How you think you'll be able to explain Bitcoin's core value proposition in the future if a contentious hard fork was able to be imposed by a small group of (corporate) participants.  This was supposed to be the people's money.  It's hard for me to reconcile how you can remain principled but ignore that fact.  Success of 2x seems like failure of Bitcoin's core philosophy of rule by consensus.
To answer a comment you made earlier about Core's silence regarding specifics of a hard fork, in my opinion the reason Core has not given specific details about a hard fork is that they want to wait until a tipping point is reached before proving that a hard fork (of any level of contention) will work.  If there remains the risk that a forced hard fork can destroy the system which could destroy people's wealth, then politicians will be less cavalier about attempting it.  Proving it's possible is opening Pandora's box.  You will have removed much of the political risk.  Let that game theory play out.
What you will also be proving, if you and the other NYA folks are successful, is that not just is a forced hard fork possible for Bitcoin, but for many if not all crypto-currencies.  You are helping to establish a dangerous precedent for the entire ecosystem.
Wouldn't it be better to simply back away from the NYA, like other members have done, because:
1. There are already 2 forks, one with big blocks, one with up to 2MB blocks+L2 scaling.  Seems like a good diversity of options.
2. Miners have already broken their side of the deal.  [Over 50% of Bitcoin hash power was mining BCH on August 22](
3. Now we know that the community is certainly not united behind 2x, so we know the fork will be contentious.
You would not be breaking your word because you are being presented with new information that was not available at the time you signed.  You would simply be being responsible and concerned that the agreement would result in the destruction of what we've all spent years of our lives developing, promoting and investing in.
This system and this space are too important to keep a promise despite new information.

When you went to Starbucks, did they give you a clear numbers on how many people they can serve a day?  It's a market and you're sharing that space with other users. It's not a dedicated pipe.


Yes, it is more complicated, as I acknowledged multiple times.  You can repeat this 100 more times but repetition does not help your argument.  It is more complicated and just like QuickSort the complexity is worth it because it materially improves the performance of the network and enables better scale.  


No, it's called getting the most out of your network.  Just as if you constantly maxed out your internet connection.


If it's so straightforward to calculate based on straight numbers (and not magnitudes) they you calculate the numbers and tell me.


Yet they provide a solution to scale to serve all the coffee payments in the world.  Ignoring SW+LN doesn't help your arguments.  It just makes you look unreasonably biased.


Because in order for the daily number of transactions to increase you have to have enough demand in fiat to raise it.  The price has been doubling and doubling again this year so demand has to exceed that pace in order for the number of transactions to significantly increase.  If the daily number of transactions were limited by the actual block limit, we'd see a lot more of a top pinned chart, but we don't.  We'd also expect to see a lot more transactions on this sub's favorite alt coin yet here we see the average block contains about 100 transactions: 


Not always but yes, you might have if you had $500 in one wallet and $500 in another and wanted to move both to an exchange for example.  It's hard to know for sure because of the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin.  My point is that we also need to look at how much wealth is moved also, not just how many transactions there are.  To look at one without the other is cherry picking.  Had the price not changed and the transaction volume stayed the same I'd be more concerned.




Great, how have you accounted for it?


How is introducing a better method to increasing transaction volume somehow equivalent to "choking Bitcoin's transactional growth"?  You are being disingenuous.  Using QuickSort instead of Bubble sort improves performance just as using LN will improve the performance of the Bitcoin network.  I think perhaps you are having a hard time wrapping your mind around it since you've been propagandized.  Please entertain the idea that perhaps what you're experiencing is cognitive dissonance.




You're going to have to explain it to me because it makes absolutely no sense to me.  What do flies have to do with cars?

You're clearly just upset that you bought the garbage the rbuttcoiners are selling instead of Bitcoin.  Those sad contrarians have been bad mouthing Bitcoin and it's "delusional supporters" since 2011 when the price was $13/BTC.
You can admit that's the reason.  It'll be therapeutic for you.
Btw, we're less than 1 month from the ATH currently sitting at a price not seen until 10 days before that.  A 40 day dip is like a walk in the park for most Bitcoiners.
So far the only way to have lost value investing in Bitcoin while being a HODLer would be if you bought for the first time in the last 40 days.  That's 40 days out of 9 years.  If you bought and HEDL any of the other 3,100 some days you'd be up.  Even if you bought the peak you could have brought your average cost down buying the dip and you'd still be up.
Feel free to bring your delusions here any time though.  It's entertaining.

I like the possible solution.  It will be interesting to see what they do and more specifically how they phrase it.
Regarding the other forks, I see the challenge.  I think they should probably encourage people to withdraw their coins prior to major forks, or have a way to pay them out in a timely manor.  Minor forks, if you support them you should have the burden on you to know to withdraw so you can control the keys.

Best short summary I've seen ;).
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:32:37
If you look at your original reply:




In order for the prediction of "nobody" to be invalid, strictly speaking, we only need 1 transaction (somebody).
In order for the prediction "almost nobody" to be invalid, we need some not insignificant portion of transactions to be present.  2.9% after 26 days seems to me to meet that standard, but I can see how some might disagree (lets wait and see).  Arguing this would be valid logic but that's not what you argued.
Bringing the term "pretty much everyone" into the conversation at all is invalid logic as that measure does not need to be met for the prediction to be assessed true or false.
In the interest of being productive, perhaps you can suggest what % you think would break over the "almost nobody" threshold.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:36:43


What leads you to believe it is necessary?  Do you have data to base that on?  Part of my point was that we don't yet have the data to show how well SegWit alone will work as a short term stop-gap to increase transaction throughput.  We also just unlocked a key to LN and have not allowed enough time (likely inside of 6 months) for it to start to have impact.  I don't see the necessity unless the real necessity is to explicitly prevent those 2 events from happening first so they cannot be fairly observed to contrast their effects to a raw block size increase.
The other thing I didn't mention is that it may be that a successful hard fork at significant adoption (certainly a contentious one) will set a precedent that it is possible, changing the risk dynamics for politicians that would be tempted to do so to regulate it.  If the risk was destruction of a cutting edge tool "that could bank the unbanked" then the risk is much higher than if there was already a similar precedent for it.  This risk is referred to by "small blockers" but apparently ignored by "big blockers".


That is something I can agree with.  The thing is, they are overwhelmingly against it.  It seems they may be OK with some regular raw block size growth (not an arbitrary doubling).  If you're interested, see Eric Lombrozo's talk at Breaking Bitcoin for his perspective.

That's a valid point too.  But it still misses the point of the OP's tweet.
The other SHA256 coins are not "Bitcoin" nor is "Bitcoin" those other coins.  They are all just SHA256 coins, differentiated by their rules, and their unique chains.  BTC and S2X will have different chains post split and simply the fact that one has more hash power doesn't make it somehow become the other.

The point is that there are ways to exchange bitcoin and fiat without going via the AML/KYC encumbered exchanges, which is important since people may not have a way to get in/out of the real bitcoin if S2X succeeds.


A simple added policy could force them to exert their influence over the bitcoin protocol.  If there were a better mix, say 20% already regulated it would be less of a concern.


Since there are tons of new buyers that likely will not know the difference (at least initially) between bitcoin and bizcoin they could keep up the charade for a while, wreaking havoc on both coins.  Suggesting that's not "anything" is not acknowledging reality.


Yeah, real leap.  The Fed just loves competition.  Look at the BitLicense and the history of private currencies.  You're the one making the leap.

The problem is how fiat is controlled and created, which is not at all the way that Bitcoin is controlled and created.
**It would be much more difficult to use Bitcoin to fund war (especially an unjust one) because it cannot be indirectly leveraged via a few people at the reigns of its dilution to *poof* create billions from thin air.** (this was the original point tens of comments ago that you replied to and you have yet to directly address it, sadly.)
Again, you type volumes to apparently avoid having to focus on the main thread and as optimistic as you seem to be it's starting to become very annoying.  Perhaps you should consider that you may be a person who would jump through hoops to avoid concession of a simple fact and who'd rather blather on about superfluous details that have nothing to do with the original dispute rather than to have to face the reality of offering that concession.  This is not a positive quality.  I know people like this and they are difficult to be around or to associate with.  Turn some of your positivity into humility and you'll make friends and therefore move forward your message of positivity more easily.
If you love Bitcoin as you apparently do according to all of the unnecessary content you've provided, then it should be quite easy to acknowledge that Bitcoin would be much harder to use to support war than fiat.  This is a simple fact.

Another is to bet him.  Tell him you'll buy .1 Bitcoin from him next year for $450.  If he's right he could buy the bitcoin in 1 year for much less than $450 and make an instant profit (or you just pay him the difference in fiat), if not he has to either buy it today to cover for $450 (and it will suck for him to have to part with it in a year for under market value) or he could buy it next year at the exchange rate then, higher than today (or just pay you the difference).
If he's confident, he'll take the bet.  If not, he's showing he's not confident about his predictive skills and general understanding of Bitcoin and markets.

I was there from the outset and it quickly became apparent that they didn't really have their own ideas.  It evolved into a contrarian sub with most posts talking about this sub and not about their own positive ideas. Perhaps it would have been harder to notice if I started there and started later.  That is however the problem as you have indicated, perhaps inadvertently: if you start there, you become misinformed and have a burden to overcome that misinformation.
It shouldn't be hard to overcome the ideas rattling around a sub.  As to what percentage is honest vs. intentional I couldn't pretend to know, but it doesn't really matter.  What matters is the reality.


And they will bear the large majority of the cost.  That burden is theirs and not mine.  I've tried to educate people there in various ways, some softer than others, but it's pointless.  Markets work when losing ideas lose, and people are forced to question their entrenched beliefs and learn from them.  That's likely happening right now and IMO the best thing we can do is help them deal with that head on and not easily allow them to chalk things all up to another conspiracy theory.  That said, I no longer have much incentive to do it.
Also, the same could be said for the rButtcoin-ers.  One lesson I learned there is that there really is no saving some people.  If they can't see their way from $13 in 2011 (when their contrarian sub started) to &gt; $4,000 today, potential ETFs, a publicly traded trust, hedge fund interest, hundreds if not thousands of "blockchain" articles, hundreds of millions if not billions in investment, governments declaring bitcoin explicitly legal, doublings of BTMs around the world, many bitcoin based debit cards etc. then there's no helping them.  Best thing to do for others that might fall prey to this sort of crap is to call it what it is - misinformation, and to call the purveyors of it what they are, ignorant and/or predacious.

Before you move your coins out of Coinbase/GDAX, with the intent of splitting them, you should really ensure you feel comfortable and understand the risks.  I think some definitive guides will be created within the next few weeks that you can study to see if you are comfortable following the steps.  That said, even the process for the BCH fork was a bit nerve wracking and that fork had replay protection.
It can be precarious so don't jump in until you are very confident.  Unlike with Ikea furniture, you can't just take it all apart and put it back together if you realize you put a part in backwards/upside down ;).

"There will be large lightning hubs [...] one of which will likely become Paypal 2.0."
Doesn't seem like an argument, it seems like a fact without teeth.  So if there were, big deal.  Just use smaller hubs or setup your own, or "meet" at agreed upon smaller hubs with folks you want to transact with.  Software will eventually make all of this easier and likely via default settings.
As you mention, big LN hubs are like Coinbase.  Users will learn the downsides as they do today.  None of this logically supports your statement:


since it appears you were suggesting the whole of LN was to go this route.  That's like suggesting the whole of the Bitcoin ecosystem is prone to become Paypal (not just Coinbase).

Clarification on the upcoming Segwit2x Fork
In our prior blog post we indicated that at the time of the fork, the existing chain will be called Bitcoin and the Segwit2x fork will be called Bitcoin2x.
However, some customers asked us to clarify what will happen after the fork. **We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.**
We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability.
It’s important for us to keep a neutral position in any fork. We believe that letting the market decide is the best way to ensure that Bitcoin remains a fair and open platform.

Have you noticed a pattern?  I've noticed a few:
1. Multiple fork attempts all peddled by folks that sooner or later show significant character flaws.  XT, Classic, Unlimited (I'm sure I'm missing a few).  Hearn slanders rage quit, Gavin unable to verify simple key signing and vouching for Scammer Wright anyway etc.  BCH with a broken algorythm and Ver promising it's the real bitcoin while not putting his money where his mouth is.  Ver paid twitter shills.  BCH failing slowly over time.  Ver can't decide which anti-bitcoin fork he likes better, BCH or B2X, depends on the day I guess.
2. "Core" chain is consistently the most valued, is run by a vast majority of nodes that also remain consistent over time, unlike the clear XT and Unlimited Sybil attacks with cloud nodes and even unabashedly pay-to-fire-up-a-node setups.  Core chain is the one that everyone tries to fork yet BCH "is the real Bitcoin".
Yet you still think that there is some hidden motivation on the part of the Core team which is only partially made up of Blockstream folks, in the face of clear lies, misrepresentations or at least the lack of any ability to forecast outcomes on the part of the opposition.
Please check yourself before you wreck yourself.

Your "argument" seems a bit of a straw man - "Everyone".  Not all miners need to collude, but the more that do the less risky and more profitable it is for them, at least in the short term or even long term if they don't "kill the host".
Satoshi didn't expect mining pools so it would have been much harder for independent miners to collude in such a way.  With large 10+% mining pools collusion starts to make financial sense and there's diminishing downside as more participants limit risk of changing the lottery dynamics.

@_date: 2017-10-22 01:01:26
I don't have a definitive source.  I just understand the basic principles.  I'd likely send my coins post fork to addresses that I control using each respective software (Core v0.15.0.1 and btc1) to ensure I'm getting a clear picture of where my coins are going.  If they leak across forks (if a transaction gets replayed across chains), I'll likely hodl and wait until the dust settles a bit more, or until someone with more expertise writes a definitive guide.
The danger of leaving your coins at Coinbase for this particular fork is that they have not made any definite statements about how they will treat the coins post fork.  Theoretically you could lose access to either coin for a critical period, at significant opportunity cost.
If you don't feel comfortable using a desktop wallet, I could see how holding the keys yourself might be an even riskier option.
Sadly, this is the type of mental exercise that people have to lose sleep over because of this fork (with no replay protection).
I'm hoping by next month the momentum will have completely fizzled out and we won't have to perform precarious and potentially costly transactions to maintain our positions.  That said, my best guess now is that at least some of the NYA signers are seeing the fork as a way to "keep their word" but are secretly hoping it fails, since it should be pretty clear there is too much contention for it to easily succeed.  It'd be a lot safer for them to step away citing unforeseen contention, but so far it's not looking like that will be the case.

In response to your well worded query:


You should take that up with whoever runs that site. That said it's a pretty common practice to clip the y-axis to the available data so folks can actually see its variance along the X-axis data points. That is why there are labels on the y-axis.


I'm not sure you can support that assertion as there are already multiple players in the space that have released support for SegWit. 16 days seems like a minimum amount of time to do internal live testing before releasing software to clients, especially software which could permanently lose significant funds if it contained bugs. Let me guess, you're not familiar with software development practices?


My comment was:


Please point out exactly what you feel is irrational exuberance.
Now for context here is your comment:




Yet apparently not only is "somebody" using it, but right from the get go it has already garnered over 1% support.
So even though your original comment was immediately proven wrong on SegWit day 1, and you're expressing equal foresight on day 16 in the face of 1% of all transactions being SegWit transactions, let's have more fun with this and meet back in 6 months to assess the situation.
If you want to make it even more interesting, since I'm guessing you'll try to save face by claiming that when you wrote "nobody" you didn't really mean [the actual definition]( perhaps you can be more specific, for example tying your prediction to a percentage and a time frame.
Thanks for following up!
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:42:49


And as I noted, while market share is "slipping" market cap is increasing implying so is adoption.  Complaining about market share as bitcoin adoption and price (market cap) are increasing is a little bit like [this]( We can't expect to dominate the ecosystem permanently. More importantly it's better for everyone involved to have a strong ecosystem building in alts.  The thought process here is that if Bitcoin dominates then there is more incentive for it to be knocked down by central bankers and governments.  If there are strong,   even better strong privacy coins ready to take the mantle it helps prevent attacks as those attacks cannot stop the technology at large.  This is also tantamount to "competition is good".  As long as price and adoption are moving up I don't understand the complaint.


Yes, because since the value of Bitcoin has massively increased more value is being transmitted.  Had the price stayed the same and daily transactions stayed the same perhaps it would be more of a concern.


Yes, it's more complicated, as a QuickSort is more complicated than Bubble Sort for example.  We should shoot for optimization before horizontal and vertical scale.  The network's massive redundancy imposes costs on those running it, so it only makes sense to best use those resources first before increasing the costs.  Also, SegWit is backwards compatible while a raw block size increase is not.  Forcing all infrastructure of the network itself and layers built on top of imposes massive costs and will cause disruption.  SegWit avoids all of it by allowing legacy transactions, legacy nodes, all legacy software etc. to continue to run as parts of the network upgrade on their own schedule.  This is equivalent to how the Internet itself increases scale.  The whole network does not need a simultaneous upgrade.  A given ISP in a given town can roll out fiber without forcing those costs on the entire network at large.


It is complicated, but no more complicated than a weighted average.  The great part is that just like the cell phone, GPS or the internet itself and many other technologies, users don't have to understand how it works to use it.  If you think it's complicated perhaps you should consider that maybe you're not the best person to argue with people about it.


I already mentioned the first priority is security of the network.  What differentiates cryptocurrencies from fiat and payment networks that work pretty well already, Paypal for example, is that it is permissionless, censorship resistant and perhaps will withstand a regulatory attack if broadly distributed.  As with BitTorrent, it's very difficult to shut everyone down simultaneously.  Even with regionally diverse nodes, if those nodes were few or all within a small number of regulatory domains then the network could be shut down via laws imposed on datacenters and ISPs.  Therefore keeping requirements low ensures maximum possible diversity.  Increasing requirements on nodes will undoubtedly cause drop off in nodes and therefore increase centralization and the point: limited points required to attack.  Forcing high requirements will also likely force many or all nodes into datacenters.  Craig Wright has even suggested nodes should be $20,000 servers. Think about the diversity that would come with that requirement.  1st world nations only and clearly the idea of people running their own node as to have no trusted 3rd party goes out the window.
With security paramount, the issues are node requirements (cpu for block verification and upstream bandwidth being the 2 more important resources).  Latency is also important especially when considering that miners are currently concentrated behind the oppressive great firewall of China.  It has been discussed many times but this translates to  block notifications across the firewall being slower than those within giving miners based in China an advantage over those outside.  Keeping block size limited (at first or until mining decentralizes) minimizes orphan rates outside the region when compared to increasing the requirements.
This is not a bullet point answer, but sometimes the details are more complicated than bullet points.  You can see however that CPU, upstream bandwidth and latency are far more important than disk space.  Disk space is almost a non-issue yet big blockers constantly bring it up as if it's has some relevance which it absolutely does not.  It's a pure strawman argument.


Perhaps where you live, but there are many people even in the 1st world for which it is not cheap.  I named Australia because I have first hand experience there.  They have upstream rating and caps.  Yes, you can run your node with limited peers, but someone has to run nodes with peers. 


Not if you want to be able to support the network.  This is tantamount to "someone else will handle security for me" and it will ensure that the network is centralized to larger players that can more easily be compromised.  Maybe you'll know that a transaction isn't valid, but that won't help when those central players are forced to employ new rules, for example blacklisting.


Yes.  I always will. And perhaps a LN node too.


No, they are just realists that a massively redundant network should never store such transactions on-chain.  You will have your coffee transactions via 2nd layers just as you do today with BitPay etc.  In the future those points of centralization will be replaced by LN and other decentralized L2 solutions.


Yes, and like many technologies before it, what starts as a rich man's tool eventually becomes every man's.  It will take intelligent scale to get there as increasing the block size will never get to billions of user in scale.  A block size increase will likely be part of the solution (as has always been the position of even those "evil Blockstream Core" guys, we just want to first optimize, then analyze and then use raw block size if required.

You've suggested there is no way to measure consensus other than hash power.

Opinion: for that reason it will likely fail spectacularly despite "having a majority of hashpower."

I can see your take on this. That said, imo the Core developers, and those that trust and agree with them, seem to be putting the emphasis on the security concerns, attack surfaces etc. before the "economic policy" as in the financial success of the system.  There have been arguments about the economics of fees but those all seem to again revolve around the attack vectors, not with the economic goals of the system (beyond survival/robustness of security).
I don't think you'll find a quote where a Core developer is suggesting we need constrained block size in order to improve the price of Bitcoin.  It all has to do with being anti-fragile.

You use a lot of words and confuse yourself.  You also apparently are not aware of this:
This is what makes the difference between "making money out of thin air" with fiat, vs. Bitcoin.  It also costs money in equipment and energy to "create" bitcoin, unlike the fed.  In case you don't get the complete picture yet, [here]( is the corresponding chart for USD, and it's future has not yet been written.  We find out at the whim of the fed.

Care to elaborate?  
It lets you not miss out on the "inevitable" gains and recovery yet opportunistically increase your position at lower prices than the top.  You can even buy into the dip all the way to the bottom bringing the average price of your new holdings down.

The reason it didn't happen the way you describe is because that would require a hard fork while SegWit brilliantly did not, allowing folks to adopt on their own schedule (or not to adopt it at all) rather than everyone having to run new software at the same time.

I don't have the info at my fingertips at the moment but I think think BitFury did some crazy dust aggregation a while back for some huge number of TXs back before segwit that IIRC had somewhere near the same amount.

I linked the whole post.  There is nothing in there to suggest it was only temporary.  In fact, I don't even see how they can fulfill the other statements in the original post if they do leave the naming up in the air.  
To interpret it the way you're suggesting would mean there's a possibility someone buys "bitcoin" soon post fork and then once this "determination" is made they would not be able to sell it as "bitcoin".  This would mean that if B2X wins your wallets would have to change names or balances would swap and a B1X or something like that would have to appear.

In order for them to imagine they have consensus they have to ignore that the primary devs are against it  that a huge majority of folks running nodes are running core code and not btc1 and that a huge chunk of the development community surrounding bitcoin are against it,  ?
Consensus requires the miners and the rest of the community.  Clearly they do not have consensus.
Explain how those links can be gamed to the degree that they show a ton more than some small dissent or you are admitting that there is no consensus for s2x and despite that they are going forward because "reliably" is something you want to define to mean what you want it to mean, but now what it really means.

Absolutely.  He's walking a fine line trying to present his system as a solution while claiming bitcoin is not.  Bitcoin even has similar debit card solutions but the difference is you can still hodl most of your coins yourself, add them on demand, use them anywhere credit cards are accepted, and if that system fails you still have access to your bitcoin.  With his you don't hold your own gold.
He's lost it or perhaps he's just over invested in gold and his new idea.  Needs to recoup his investment.

That's the wrong characterization.
The one holding the coin and keys can sell it and choose a different coin (in seconds).
The one holding the mining hardware will have to try to sell it despite it's diminished value.
These are different risk/value ratios and they are a natural part of the system.  So to a greater degree the miner operates at the pleasure of his clients (the users) and not the other way around.

If I had to guess the OP reposted this at least partially out of respect for Erik.  I know when I've asked him questions in the past it was because I think he can be reasoned with.  He seems like a principled person that may have some outside factors clouding his judgement at the moment.
The important technical factors aside, I think the appeal that may eventually work on him is to enlighten him to the fact that if this contentious fork succeeds it will have proven Bitcoin does not ensure trust and consensus.  To me this is the central issue and Block sizes and UTXO sets while important are the details.  Trust and consensus make up the philosophy.
The author touched on that with Rothschild's quote and Erik's apparent ideological opposition to it, but I think that point needed more emphasis.  Proving mostly already regulated companies can force rule changes on the system will be to me the death of the system.

You're way off man.  I'm not sure what you find in this thread of value as your ideology runs contrary to most of the sentiment here and the core ideology of bitcoin.  You seem to put your faith in government and to have bought the whole government vs. corporations b.s. which is just a distraction, "pay no attention to that man behind the curtain".  Government is the key to corporations running rampant. Without government there would be more competition, not less, more repercussions for bad actors (no bail-outs) and no way for large organizations to have the states cooperation to go after consumers (think RIAA, MPAA).  You've bought into the statist mentality hook line and sinker.  Good luck to you.

I agree that's a claim you're making.  Maybe you should provide a link to the data your basing it on.  Until then it just seems like words with arbitrary meaning based on some assumptions you've made.  Providing evidence would be more consistent with someone making an oddly semantic argument about what "released" means, source code or binaries.


There was nothing dishonest, Sheriff.  Just an impatient and entitled person demanding someone else compile code so he could use it and a very patient and busy developer providing you with a possible explanation for your apparent confusion.  
"How dare someone use the word 'released' to mean just the source code.  That would imply having to take some responsibility myself to use my free software for accessing my revolutionary decentralized network (or wait a few days).  Appalling!"

Hmm, I can think of at least 1.  To ensure it doesn't have any obvious crash bugs.  A burn in period seems like a good idea.  Not to mention people actually using the nodes, rather than just voting with them, might not want to just wait until activation day to flip it on and see if/how it works.
Also, now that 0.15.0 is out one can also check their Peers tab to see how many peers they find and how that might change over time.

No one is ignoring the growing pains of Bitcoin caused by massive adoption.  The main issues are times with high fees, which we are [currently not in]( generally caused by [spam attacks]( which thankfully seem to be tapering (supporters of competing coins must be running out of money).
As evidence that this is not a problem that is being ignored we can see that SegWit was activated around 2 weeks ago and there is already [very healthy SegWit transaction growth]( and of course there is a massive development and testing effort happening on 6 separate implementations of the Lightning Network now that SegWit is in place.  In fact the first LN transaction went through on SegWit activation day, so it's clear this is a priority that is being addressed.

I wonder if there mightn't be more to this story.
Consider the following excerpt:
"While Cook noted that “privacy and security are built” into Apple’s products from the beginning, he didn’t address Apple and Google’s bitter struggle with the government over cell phone encryption. Last year, the FBI spoke out strongly against the encryption saying it would hamper law enforcement’s ability to do its job. Tech companies, meanwhile, are worried about protecting their customers’ data from the government in a post-Snowden world."
from [here](
Could this be a flank from Obama to send a message to Apple and Google (and anyone else at least acting like they will be actually securing citizens' data against NSA spying) that if they don't leave a government back door that they will be considered "co-conspirators"?
Just food for thought.

Do you have a link to a statement from them?  I'm unaware that they've voiced their position.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:59:39
You make some good points and to a degree I agree.  That said, I think the best possible outcome is for S2X support to slowly fall and the "business community" in this case the NYA signers, to realize that Bitcoin is not business as usual.  The sooner that lesson is learned/proven the better for the ecosystem.  If S2X succeeds even to a minor degree I think you'll see a continued attack (see the posts in rBTC now, for example praying that replay protection is not added to S2X).
Also, if there are 3 major coins competing for SHA256 hash power that would seem problematic.  You can see the minor problems already caused by BCH where Bitcoin blocks/hour dip.  Imagine that was multiplied by 2 with intersecting waves.  Even with their regular minority of hash power it would be a problem.  If the took 50% it could kill the utility of both chains, at least until miners realized they were hurting themselves as well.
TL;DR: IMO, better for hard lessons to be learned sooner than for each echo chamber to be treated as equal and to persist.  Markets function better when participants either win, learn hard lessons or become economically impotent.

You have to create a public amazon wishlish, set the delivery address and remove the "surprise me" setting, add the item - in this case the gamestop card - to the wishlist (I'd suggest only one item per wishlist to avoid someone only fulfilling part of it), then paste the URL of the wishlist into purse.  Then you can set your own discount, in this case to 25%.  You may need to wait a while for someone to "buy your ask" so to speak since that's a deep discount translating to a large premium on the btc buyer's side.

I think most people believe in increasing the block size, but in a way that ensures we don't sacrifice "too much" however much that is, decentralization.

The fact that they follow the majority work chain without checking for validity is actually a missing feature, not a feature in itself.
If a knowledgeable user has a "chosen consensus network" they will either not use an SPV wallet, or will aim their SPV wallet at a known node that actually supports "their chosen consensus network".
The point that was being made was that "the average user" doesn't know any of this.  Your response didn't address it, it just ignored it.  Kind of like how SPV wallets ignore the validation rules.

I just doubled your math to account for the the node being relayed.  Perhaps when you said "a block has to transferred twice to each node" that's what you meant already?
You don't seem to be engaging on the issue of the bandwidth required for relaying transactions. Perhaps you don't know, which is a perfectly fine response, I don't know for a fact but I assume there is some traffic, perhaps equivalent in size to the blocks eventually consisting of those transactions.
Regardless of transcontinental traffic if a person has a 512kbit connection (as people may in some or many of the 150 other countries not listed in the wikipedia page) it appears that the node would max out their connection regardless of whether they are relaying from the next town.  Presumably people have other reasons they want internet too, like to educate their kids, so using even half of their bandwidth constantly doesn't scale.  You've also not commented on the expense involved which is equally concerning.  For example, anyone can buy and use a satellite phone but not many can afford it.  The latter fact is the important one to consider not the former.
Even at 260kbit/second number you posted which doesn't include transactions, that may or may not be a factor, that's 84 GB/month which may blow many people's caps and therefore budgets.  That's a factor of 10 over our modern USA mobile caps so it doesn't seem a stretch that many countries have similar caps on home connections.
Update: Here's some recent data on Australia.  I'll look for others, but I use them as an example of a modern 1st world country.  
Another Australia update.  While this shows some significantly higher speeds you'll also see some low caps.  These obviously don't apply to everyone, just those with limited connectivity options.

I think you need to put more thought into your statement and philosophy.  You are seemingly implying that the government is an efficient regulator of would-be corruption when in fact they are the primary source of it.  Yes multinationals exert influence but most of that is via power for sale by politicians, not by direct abuse of their consumers or non-politically empowered anti-competitive actions.  Corporations are also held to a standard of profitability which is more than we can say for our ever expanding and constantly deficit spending government.  
The era of needing the "protection" of the state from monopolies or out of control corporations is over (if it ever was needed at all).  We now have internet based communications and reputation systems in place to help combat those types of abuses of consumers. Before you scoff at that statement look at companies like Whole Foods that offer "similar" products at higher prices based on a less tangible differentiation (the environment, non-gmo, insert green movement buzzword here).  They've shown that price is not the only driver.  
We also live in an incredibly innovative time where established industries are being disrupted regularly by new players and technology which keeps legacy players in check (telecom, news, TV, transportation, hotels, money etc.).  We don't need the government to "help us" with that.
Rand appears to be one of the few politicians that is at least saying the right things, and on mostly doing the right things.  He and his father have been true advocates for reducing the size and power of government and reminding people of the original intent and genius of our Constitution and individual liberty.  That's an uphill battle when he himself is surrounded by powerful incumbent forces from "both" parties.

For some reason you think Nick is making a technical assertion about an economic issue, yet if the system fails due to a technological failure the economic value of the system will undoubtedly fail too.  That's how I see his point.
You also seem to fail to recognize that the block size debate is not just an economic one.  It brings a potentially more important technical challenge that could decentralize bitcoin making it no different than any other state controlled/regulated payment system.  If node bandwidth costs become prohibitive in some significant % of countries you may effectively kill it's utility in those markets.  I think that would probably cause devaluation to bitcoin.
Also, fracturing the system for any reason will likely cause failure for everyone in the form of chaos.
Nick is suggesting caution and slow progress over revolution.  Wise advice imo.

Fine definition, now explain exactly what you think the value prop is in terms of what a peer-to-peer electronic cash system offers over all of the centralized payment systems we already have.  What do you want to do with it that you can't do with PayPal?

"In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another. This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, **but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation**.

2. as payment for the service provided by 21 micropayment network.  They don't need to accept credit cards, have a money exchange license etc.  
At the very least they figured out an elegant solution to how people can easily pay for webservices.  That alone is nothing short of huge.  As I've been posting for a while, they may have also cracked decentralized internet via small cell repeaters which is why Qualcomm is involved.

Just to clear one thing up.  ABC, if it's an address as you state, as in the one that shows right now on the account's page (the one with send/receive buttons) is just the current unused address.  As soon as you do another transaction it will be replaced with the next unused address as the prior one was used for that recent transaction.
The way you described it made it sound like ABC is some sort of proxy or is static, it's not.  The reason you don't see it on the blockchain is that by definition if it's showing on the account page you have not used it yet.  Go to the Transactions view, click a transaction and click "Show Details".  Then you will see the address that was used for that particular transaction.  You could copy/paste it into blockchain.info and it should show.

Just the right guy, with the just right message at the just right moment.  This is the definition of Andreas M. Antonopoulos.  Who needs a foundation when one man is single handedly, articulately and delicately (when required) spreading the virtues of bitcoin all over the world to all the right people?
I think you should embrace the formal title of "Ambassador of Bitcoin" and perhaps be the CEO and CFO too.  I can't think of a better person to make hard decisions, with a more proven track record and passion, understanding and vision than you.  That said, I'd feel concerned at the giant "X" this might put on your head or back with respect to different interests both pro and anti-bitcoin.  
Perhaps though we can take your advice, follow your example, and be decentralized ambassadors for bitcoin.  I don't pretend to be any sort of authority on the complex psychology of groups and organizations, but it has always seemed that a centralized organization was not in the spirit of this new technology.  It felt old-school from the very start.
Just an idea, could we recommend that pools add a setting that optionally slices off a couple % to target a certain dev or project?  I know miners run thin margins, but it's a start and we/they are interested in increasing adoption, stability, scalability etc.  There are totally aligned interests there.  
Perhaps without the Foundation being a potential for corruption/controversy/waste (not saying it's true, but it's at least a perception) there would be more interest in this from miners, and perhaps others, like bitcoin based businesses.
Just some food for thought.

Thanks for the explanation.  I'm not trying to spread FUD btw, just trying to wrap my head around this and I don't see much discussion of the relationship between the block size and the bandwidth requirements.
Don't nodes also relay transaction announcements?
Regarding the relaying of blocks, it still seems as if the bandwidth required to relay the block to another peer hasn't been factored, but perhaps you're dismissing it as negligible.  For simplicity sake, if every node has 16 peers then on average one of those peers will be asking your node for the latest block, right?  Assuming I haven't botched this, that's 16MB/10 minutes with a 8MB block size.  I think that's 512 kbits or .5 mbit/second.  
If transaction announcements are indeed also part of the role of nodes then I assume that could add another 16MB/10 minutes or so on average (receiving and then broadcasting to one peer).
I've read elsewhere that the concern is also regarding the impact on TOR based nodes.  I imagine this is for the sake of protection from a potential legal attack on bitcoin.
The other thing to consider is bandwidth caps. In the US we mostly enjoy freedom from that but even in modern countries like Australia they apparently still have caps and extra charges for overages even in major cities.
Not to be contentious but you haven't addressed your claim that "all those "3rd world countries" also have excellent internet connection".

Your personal thought is not really a high standard to hold other people to when trying to characterize what they are saying as flat out wrong.
You think they won't add him, others think they will, or that they already intend it for him or would-be whistle blowers like him.  
I think it's also a little interesting how much you seem to have vested in this.  If you're not a shill you're certainly spending a lot of your free time passionately arguing on the behalf of the state and it's "State of Emergency."  Though good on you for your conviction if that's truly what it is.
I for one don't trust the state.  I think it's much more likely that this is meant to protect the state and the status quo at the expense of the citizenry than as it tries to imply, to protect citizens.  That's another reason people likely think you're a shill.  Many if not most people here hold that view, which makes a lot of sense considering we're talking about an alternative to state manipulated currency.

I identify with some of your thoughts but I think there's room in the space for the IoT, the OP and other ideas that you may not realize could take us toward more of a Libertarian/Anarchist future.  I think the 21 Qualcomm partnership has as a primary goal to proliferate really high speed internet access.  To allow users to plug in a device that utilizes and provided bandwidth to mobile device and uses bitcoin to pay for those trades.  This could help decentralize internet access which is clearly an important development for freedom loving people worldwide.
Here are some links to help explain my theory about 21 and Qualcomm's goals:
I do agree though that the IoT has the potential to have the opposite affect, like TVs watching us for example.  So we need to be cautious and pay attention, but stifling the OPs enthusiasm doesn't seem like the right approach to me.

First, who suggested you need to?  The devices that primarily would be doing this, at least for the example I'm focusing on, are the Access Points.
Second, It seems well within the realm of possibility that their chips could be scaled down and potentially power managed/depowered when the devices are on battery power, as opposed to when charging.  They could perhaps not even mine unless they are plugged in and fully charged.
Third, why is it when I effortlessly render your weak yet authoritative statements completely invalid, like this one "That's a silly nonsense bootstrapping problem", you just come up with another equally authoritative and weak statement?  It seems there is no end to it.  And all the while your comments have an undertone that these weak ideas somehow undermine a project that is being supported by industry leaders with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Most of those types of violations you listed or equally unjust ones happen in the first world with the help or collusion of government: "rampant pollution of groundwater, rivers, oceans, price gouging through monopoly power, forced evictions, restricting people's right to free movement and to protest, unsafe work conditions, financing conflict, mislabeling products, and so forth."
A corrupt EPA extorting money from individuals, government granting monopoly power and protecting incumbents with high priced licensing or overburdensome regulation that only big players can afford to comply with, wrongful imprisonment, taxation, unconstitutional check points, unsafe infrastructure, corruptible FDA regulators.

You've not made any case that government solves those problems and it's clear to most that government introduces an abundance of problems by centralizing power, making a market for it.

So you think most people should be making on-chain transactions then?  What exactly do you see as bitcoin's differentiator?
TOR and low bandwidth constraints seem necessary if we want the network to be used and protected all throughout the world.  If governments can start picking off nodes/users by shutting them down in data centers or via policy enforced on data centers then bitcoin becomes PayPal 2.0 - woo hoo.
I think the people on the conservative side see it as something more important than a new payment method.  They see it as a tool for sovereignty.  Changes that can affect that need to be carefully considered.
I see it as comparable to if the early internet was starting to get pushed toward a hub and spoke model.  That could have had some really negative implications and removed much of the utility and benefit of the internet.  It's bad enough we are tracked and subject to propaganda, imagine if all we could consume was state approved content.  Then imagine it's not just modern westerners with our supposedly free and democratic governments.

:) - Since you asked...
First, I'm not sure, and I can only speak for myself (in the USA btw), but for me I think it started with decades of observations and a general uneasiness about our decline into this amorphous and unwieldy social, political and financial state.  I asked many questions of other people and just pondered to myself regarding why certain things were the way they were.  Tech people tend to ask more questions in my experience.  Example, taxation.  How is it good to tax people more based on how much more they make?  Doesn't that disincentivize hard work?  Why when we improve our homes is an assessor dispatched to calculate how much more property tax you need to pay?  Doesn't that disincentivize improving our homes and lifting our neighborhoods?  Also, isn't that a little odd?
I became familiar with banking compliance some time ago (or so I thought) and then had some conversations with a friend of mine that is a bank compliance officer.  I learned that they are not tasked with ensuring the bank has proper reserves, as I had improperly assumed, and that there was not simply a program to report large (over $10,000) deposits and withdrawals (as if that's not odd already) but to ensure that the citizen's accounts don't contain any "fishy" activity.  This includes looking for multiple deposits or withdrawals that add up to larger amounts (not even necessarily $10k), who people did business with etc.  This seemed a little odd also.
I realized via home ownership that capital gains tax is a form of double taxation whereby most people were taxed on the "gain" in their home's value despite the fact that most of the gain was simply inflation.  Thankfully some exemptions were put in place about 15 years ago that helped cut some part of that scam, but I was still left wondering how the concept even came about and why people put up with it for as long as they did.  Consider inheritance taxes too. The theme, the government wants its vig and it will get it in little bites all throughout your life, keeping the host alive while taking as much of his lifeblood as it can.
I found that investing became very difficult as there were many more dynamics affecting the overall outcome.  I became worried even in the companies I truly believed in as market crashes seemed to do more to affect my results than the merits of the companies themselves.
I learned that I was more of a pure capitalist and what crony capitalism was and how it seems to make a world of difference.
I started to see politicians as the problem rather than focusing on people with different political beliefs.  I realized I was being distracted by politicians into arguing with my fellow citizens about issues that didn't really matter, fighting for or against politicians that weren't that far apart in philosophy and that the problem was caused by all of them over the last century or so (1913 was a big year).  I realized that what I wanted was not the lesser of 2 evils but representation that would take us back to our founding principles, that personal liberty was paramount and that our government to be limited in what it could do.  We have slipped very far from that, and I don't blame any specific person (except maybe FDR) but realize that it is what many of the founders warned us of.  It is the nature of government, perhaps derived from the nature of man.  I see it somewhat as an internal battle that must continually be fought between the hard working survival drive and the temptation to abuse and steal and manipulate (we see cheaters in nature, it's just part of life).  In summary, "don't pay attention to that man behind the curtain", the politicians and their corruptibility should be the focus rather than "the rich", or "oligarchical multinational corporation", or "lobbyists".  The problem is the power that we give to our government which inevitably will be corrupted. (just my opinion)
I noticed general apathy among most of the people I worked with.  I remember being passionate and working with a few passionate people and feeling good about little things like increasing people's productivity.  I realized even then that most people seemed to punch the clock and not really care about what they were doing, just about the paycheck, and that most were incompetent (sadly).  I saw that apathy and lack of motivation manifest itself as ugly politics.  Rather than work hard and be accountable it was easier to not and to play politics.  To me this was a little microcosm of the larger system and also seemed to be a symptom of something more.
I started considering why there seemed to be no economies of scale in important areas like education and city services.  Why in populated areas was it more expensive per capita to teach kids and provide services rather than less?
I could go on and on, and to an extent I have.
In comes bitcoin.  After the obligatory 1st glance in mid 2013 and the initial denial that so many of us seem to have in common, I caught the virus.  I asked myself what money really was, what the Fed is (I'm still not sure I truly know).  I always knew currency and money were a medium of exchange, a common denominator of value to help voluntary trade among people that had no direct trade to make, but I didn't understand how our fiat dollars came into existence or how they differed from "sound money" like precious metals or commodities.  I started to ask "why" about many more things (I'll spare you the details).  The more time I spent researching it and just thinking about it, the more I realized that bitcoin was as Andreas puts it, the "internet of money" and in it was the potential to solve many if not all of the problems I had noticed over a lifetime.  It was also a very vocal "physical" manifestation of an active counter force to the strange and unfamiliar direction most everything else seemed to be going.
It all clicked.  I saw it all very clearly.  The rest of my time has been spent reading as much as I can to help decide what to do with this amazing opportunity in front of us all.  Whether to go all in, either in terms of investment of money or time.  Trying to imagine what possible catastrophic bug the code or the concept could contain that might make this whole marvelous invention collapse.  Building little projects to familiarize myself with the concepts.  Watching what others are doing in the space to help get my gears moving as to how I can contribute in a profound way.
What I find so compelling about bitcoin is that it seems to force us all to ask important questions, like some of the ones I've mentioned above, but also more fundamental questions that only a system like this could have catalyzed.  For example, why does the government think it has authority over the fruits of my labor?  Isn't that a form of slavery?  Is that concept even Constitutional?  Why does "free trade" seem to be portrayed as positive when it applies to nations but not when it applies to individuals?  What are the true implications of unfettered global person to person trade?  Who has jurisdiction over me and the work that I decide to do and why is it based on geography?  Is the internet more of a nation than a geographic nation?  What would happen in theory if we could eliminate all middle-men?
I don't have the answers to these questions, but I think my particular fugue state is me trying to answer some of them for myself.  This is a very interesting time to be alive and I also feel like in the bitcoin community I am in good company with people making similar realizations that don't solely apply to digital currency, but to the meaning we define for ourselves in our lives.  I think we are on the brink of something extraordinary in terms of personal liberty and it's happening at a time when (please forgive the nationalism) the greatest bastion of freedom the world has ever seen appears to be on the precipice of a tremendous and tragic decline. For example our Bill of Rights seems to be slowly getting chipped away.  
I see how the actions of one man with great conviction, a fabulous mind and a life's work of curiosity, likely about some of these same things, building on the technology of similar people before him, has introduced a force potentially more powerful than all of the historical tyrants that ever were.  He has released the genie from the bottle handing the power back to individuals to control their own destiny.  I believe this will eventually expose all of the corruption and fat in the system.  It will separate the producers in society from those feeding parasitically off of it and force people to ask more of themselves, while at the same time making obvious the rewards.  Without layers of bureaucracy the system becomes simple again, and people can again more directly be motivated via truly seeing the result of their efforts.
I want to be a part of that movement.  I want our children to have the best chance at knowing what true freedom is.  Along those lines I think my fugue state is looking for that special opportunity for me to contribute whatever it is that I uniquely have to offer toward that end.  For now it's this rough philosophy and the best words I can muster to articulate it.  Hopefully that little drop reverberates.  Some day hopefully the light bulb moment occurs and I'll have more to offer.
As a side note, one of my favorite [recent observations]( is from Tim Draper.  Fat lazy industries: Banking, Education, Medicine and Government.  As for Banking (finance in general, and maybe moon?) there is bitcoin.  For education there is [Khan Academy](  Not sure about medicine, but government seems like it's due for a shake up.  Perhaps bitcoin will be the disruptor there too.
We live in very exciting times.

@_date: 2015-09-05 01:45:52


Citations needed.  I believe there are many parts of the world to which anything other than low bandwidth is expensive.  I've looked around and it seems currently that a full node [requires about 1 megabit/second]( connection just for the current state of the bitcoin network and blockchain limit.  I'm not sure if that requirement scales linearly with transaction volume or by multiples.  I think it may be by multiples as transactions are mirrored to multiple peers.
Here is the 2014 data according to wikipedia and akamai on the [average bandwidth by country]( but it also doesn't speak to cost or the other 150 or so countries that are not on the list.
I think the idea is that in order to ensure maximum decentralization of the base network it should be affordable to host these at home, over TOR, and in most countries that have internet access.  As progress is inevitably made on bandwidth speeds and costs of course that removes/raises this particular gating factor.
Keep in mind it's been suggested that there is another important issue which is the speed of transmission of the completed blocks.  As I understand it, as blocks become larger the time it takes to receive them grows (of course) giving the miner who found the block a larger head start on the next block.  
These are non-trivial technical issues that make this more than just changing some constants in some code and buying more hard drive space.

I'm not a lawyer but if you have "your mentor" who might be a fed, and a crime committed against you, and threats against you and your compatriots by a fed and the mentor suggests bumping the other off, that sounds like what I thought entrapment was.  I thought you had to be predisposed to do the crime not handed the motivation and then encouraged.  It almost sounds as if the first silk road may have been a creation of the feds to lure people in and then claim success when they shut "them" down.
Imagine the feds acted as home invaders and stole all your wealth and threatened your friends (roommates?), would it be entrapment if you tried to retaliate to prevent further harassment?  Would you have had a need or a disposition to it if the crime didn't first happen? 
Do prostitution traps have women solicit Johns at Hotels and first represent themselves as interested single women, only to disclose they want money when they are back in the room?
 I don't have the answer and am not an authority but it doesn't seem clear to me that it's not entrapment.

If changes are made to the limits which impact bandwidth usage this changes the costs of running nodes (and the gaming that can be done by miners btw), and therefore the ability of bitcoin to defend against would-be attacks via regulation.
Regarding your "paranoid" comment.  We should all be that kind of paranoid.  All fiat currencies eventually fail and [the USD seems to be well on its way](  Governments [will pull out all the stops]( to seize wealth of all forms [including shutting down]( or [regulating into impotence]( competing systems.  If you follow the news at all you should see no shortage of references to what can only be characterized as [currency wars](
IMO the importance of bitcoin is that it's currently unstoppable in the way that bittorrent is unstoppable.  Not putting enough thought into this experiment to chase a meager improvement that is not even viable long term is unwise.  Decentralized redundant systems cost orders of magnitudes more than centralized systems therefore making it a pointless exercise to try to compete with current payment mechanisms toe to tow, at the same time completely missing the attribute that makes bitcoin different.  It's not just that it's peer to peer, it's what the result of that is, currently, free from the hands of government.
Napster was p2p and only partially centralized.  TPB was shut down via data centers, but bittorrent lives on.

Both seem like a logical consequence, but of course we have more people than any prior fiat currency that believe in the USD.  We also have the largest military force that ever existed so I'm sure that doesn't hurt.  It would seem though that at some point quadrupling the money base "could" come back to haunt the USD.  
I also theorize that we actually have massive real inflation.  Real inflation is supposedly decoupled from monetary base inflation.  Some suggest they are not even related but that's hard to imagine.  I think perhaps they are decoupled only by the time it takes for the effects of the base expansion to turn into "real" inflation.  The 2nd part of my theory is that we are not seeing and feeling the real inflation since we also have a massive deflationary force which is caused by technological advancements and their associated productivity improvements.  Tech is now invading many more areas of life bringing with it Moore's law.  Medical equipment, manufacturing equipment etc. are all improving, in theory at a more similar rate to Moore's law.  Think about how much clothes cost now.  They are cheaper now even before adjusting for reported inflation.
The question that this all brings up to me is what would the landscape look like if we didn't have these crazy financial policies yet did have the technological progress, or even worse, what would things look like if it were the other way around?  Some would argue that "free money" helped drive tech.  There is likely some truth to this but at the same time that didn't really start in the US until the decoupling of the dollar from gold, and before that the introduction of fiat and the federal reserve.  Historical charts show that technology has been following a relatively smooth exponential curve since the begging of civilization independent of these monetary changes.
I see it as the politicians and people with influence over them milking the fruits of technological progress.  People don't notice a few percentage points per year, like a boiling frog, but at some point it means the difference between a $100,000 average home price and $300,000 average home price and your cooked.
It's hard to time the markets but to me it feels like the perfect storm is converging and the money masters have run out of tricks.  Yellen just punted on the meager interest rate increase, one of her last possible "illusions".  That can't mean anything good.  Unlike when a 3rd world currency collapses, the USD is the de facto world currency if there ever has been one.  Most oil is traded in it for example.  If we go down I think we're going take everyone down with us.
The good news, corrections seem to return people to reality, make them tighten their belts and get in stronger and nimbler shape to face the future.  Boom and bust cycles have existed for a long time.  Let's hope the bust is not as big as the boom.

I'm pretty sure we'll be able to add mining chips to mobiles in some capacity, but it's not even required for 21s ideas to work, namely the mobile internet access as the APs would be the ones with the chips and the phones could simply consume.
No having lots of money doesn't mean everything, but having a successful track record in tech, like Qualcomm and Cisco does kind of give one more credibility than someone that can't even make a compelling argument on the internet.

I have an idea, let the market decide.  Why all this railing against something that is clearly positive for the network?  Don't like it, guess what?  Don't buy it.  Not at all complicated.  That type of decision is made literally billions of times per day.  Why aren't you writing long posts railing against Coke for being unhealthy?  Personal choices.
0.16 Joules per Gigahash seems like a pretty nice development all on it's own.  Getting that chip price down via volume seems like another nice potential accomplishment that can only reinforce the anti-fragility of bitcoin.  Turnkey nodes and lowering the barrier to entry via an "energy to bitcoin transformer" also seems like a smart idea and can only increase bitcoin's reach.  A shipping marketplace with no login required?  Seems like a pretty nice contribution as well.
If they corner the mining market, guess what, that will motivate competition and perhaps people will turn off their miners and/or choose some other alternative. 
They have come up with some great ideas and are seemingly inspiring even more.  
Perhaps you should focus on moving things forward in the universe of ideas rather than holding others back who are.

Are you saying that the only bandwidth a node uses is to relay a single block 2 times per 10 minutes?  That cannot possibly be the case.  Are you forgetting the peer nodes?
How many peers do your nodes average?
@_date: 2015-09-29 02:42:30
Did either of you read the article?  Did you understand it?  There was no slam dunk in there, though there were some interesting ideas to consider.
"allows two peers to efficiently reach the same state while transferring the minimal amount of data by sending only the differences."  This still implies a node would need to send the diffs.  Most people advocating larger blocks don't even consider overhead and assume the data being sent is just 2 x the block size (one in and one out) meaning the minimum possible size.  This idea would help limit the data sent to just that but there is no magic that for example could get us to half of that (1 x block size).
The node boostrapping idea using a CDN is good, and it seems it will help in terms of allowing new nodes to startup faster and more efficiently, perhaps helpful during an attack, but the focus of the concern of the conservative perspective has been the cost to run a node, and hasn't been too concerned about the cost to launch a node.  The net, great idea, but it doesn't solve the main bottleneck of limited bandwidth.
"However, an individual node can be replaced with a cluster of machines running the distributed, sharded node. This would increase the resilience of an individual node without sacrificing any of the network’s decentralized properties."  Great goal for data-center based nodes but I think it will be a while before that helps nodes running on private servers, in homes etc.  The concern with data center hosted nodes is one of state control.  Data centers are easy points of attack.  Ask TPB about that.
"However, one should allow a significant margin-of-error when making projections 20 years in future. Even if 8 gigabyte blocks in 2036 sound feasible, one should account for larger network and, thus, more than 8 connections per peer to maintain low latency. Further dampening factors include those not related to network, e.g., room for cryptographic agility."   This seems to make the case of proceeding with caution and not making wild assumptions about future capability.
Even in closing: "We should work to extend Bitcoin with those advances as they mature."  note "as they mature."
This article should hardly be seen as a conviction of a slow and methodical approach to scaling bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:55:19

Gavin, can you clear something up for me?  Doesn't a node have more responsibility than to simply receive completed blocks?  I thought they also relay those blocks and also transactions to peers.  I heard also that nodes average 20 or so peers, but I could be wrong about that.
If so wouldn't that mean quite a bit more than 8MB/10 minutes as you suggest?

You've added nothing to the discussion and have not addressed any of the issues with James *behavior* which was my primary focus after first being concerned about his *ideas*.  You seem to share the opinion though not the concern over his bad ideas but then excuse his bad behavior.  Instead of protecting and enabling that behavior perhaps you should put your blind admiration for him on hold for a few minutes and hold his comments to the same standard you want to hold mine to.  As a matter of fact my comments to him were much more substantive and constructive than his childish responses which is also evidenced by him deleting them, and his own videos.

James D'Angelo: "Well, if someone says they are going to fly at the speed of light and I find a theoretical problem with their ability to do that, that has value.  So don't negate the ability to critique and the value of critiquing."

You're hilarious.
My points have focused on his reaction to criticism/questions about his idea.  Read the sentence you quoted and then look at the rest of your response.  You responded to something other than the quote.  Now who's got the problem interpreting comments?
Who's making ad hominem attacks?  James and you.
Who's using profanity? James and you.
Who's demeaning another reddit users' (in fact many reddit users) value? James and you.
Who's making appeals to authority, James and you.
Who's using shill accounts?  James.
So now, who's the problem?
You seem to use similar tactics to James.  Perhaps another shill account?
The only one introducing drama is you.  Present ideas, take feedback, respond to questions or perhaps you should stop posting your ideas publicly as you clearly can't handle the feedback.  Btw, that feedback is valuable and that value is intrinsically understood at a place like reddit.  As a matter of fact it is the primary value proposition of this site.  See the up and down arrows and this place where we type?  Do you understand how the front page works?  Reddit is feedback.
The fact that James has removed most of his videos, and your rambling blame paragraph, make the case that he/you couldn't handle it.  You blame the community.   LOL.  Poor middle aged principled intelligent man intimidated by internet comments takes his ball and goes home.  That's a laugh.  More like self aggrandizing self proclaimed expert experiences cognitive dissonance when having to answer basic questions.  The problem with the questions is that it crashes his delusions of grandeur about himself. 
Go find a safe space if you can't handle it "kid".


If I'm interpreting what you mean correctly (hard to tell among all the profanity and emotion) then the answer is a resounding "yes".  If his ideas were good they would have generally been bet with positivity and survived.  Since he couldn't support them (to say the least) they faded into irrelevance exactly where they belong.  Since it seems you agree: "I've stated over and over that I dont like his idea and think it has no merit." then you should probably agree this was the appropriate outcome, so please stop crying about it and him/you.

Seems like most people are missing your question.
My opinion: "they'll try" but it will likely be harder with bitcoin that it was with PayPal.  It seems to me they'd have to do a lot more work, for example by examining your purchasing habits (the ones not done in bitcoin),  your rent/mortgage payments (if you have them).  They may also try to follow the chain so to speak from bigger fish via audits that may lead to you.  Depending on what your business is and what kind of paper trail you leave you'd have to consider that.
Seems like for some lifestyles the burden on the state to figure out what was going on would be much higher making investigations more costly.  Not sure if that will mean more agents, less investigations, a higher threshold to ensure success (going after lower hanging and riper fruit for example), or to just punt.  My bet is they will try but fail unless you leave big footprints.
I'm not a lawyer nor expert, just analytical.  Ymmv.

So it's reasonable to publicly propose "A half baked idea, but not even that, more like a 1/10th baked idea" and then to slam anyone that has reservations and questions about it?  No, that's not reasonable.  What's the purpose of proposing the statement in a public forum?  Most would assume to garner feedback and further the discussion of those ideas.  That's not what he seeks.
Unfortunately we can't see any of the old comments on James' videos where you can clearly see a pattern of thanking blind praise and sling ad hominem and insults at anyone that dared ask a question.  You can see the same pattern here via his shill accounts:
Here's another thread where he clearly is using a shill account and then responds with his own.  Check out the level of dialog from each side:
Here again with same shill account, and notably trying to distance himself from his prior statements concerning anonymity with a damage control twitter post:

It requires a bit of thinking:

I stand corrected.  Interestingly I needed to RTFM in the context of your specific comment.  I believe this tutorial is relevant:
As you said, while transactions are free, on chain transactions are not and to timestamp a tweet, in lieu of some sort of aggregation service, you'd need a fee.
I think it would be possible however to aggregate hundreds/thousands of tweets (or other content) that requested timestamping and then to hash them and move that hash to the blockchain thereby cutting the cost per tweet down significantly.  That said, it's not exactly what the author seemed to be suggesting or you were appropriately pointing out.  Though it does seem like it would be possible with a little bit of extra work so the concept is still viable.
Thanks for the clarification, I learned something new. 
Both your comments upvoted.

I'm starting to think you're a shill for D'Angelo.  You even has the same argument technique to belittle rather than explain.


Actually he called it an "[axiom](  Sounds a lot like a theory.  Btw, he did do a video about it.  It seems he's taken it down.
Btw what's to stop people from colluding in James' proposed system?  What's to stop someone from leveraging these known humans?  If anything, them being known people makes leveraging them easier.
James seems to love to propose ideas, which is great, but they are not baked and when people start asking tough questions he gets upset that they question his authority and tries to suggest they are nobodies and uses insults in place of answers.  It would seem to me there are pro's and cons to the ability to anonymously mine, and pros and cons to being known.  We do already know of many systems of "trusted representatives" and we know the many pitfalls.  The burden of proof when suggestiong proof of work should be replaced or modified to be more like essentially it's dying predecessor in the realm of trust, is clearly on the side of the person suggesting such a thing.

I think you are projecting.
The quadrupling of the money base is unprecedented and therefore notable all on it's own.  
From 1986 to 2001 there was an actual expansion not just an artificial one in an attempt to fend off collapse, and guess what else?  [There were non-zero interest rates the whole time](  Nothing to see here.  Please explain how that's not important.  Let's see if the money masters will ever keep their commitment to raise interest rates a fraction of a percent.  Or is it that they haven't because they can't due to all of our sovereign debt?  Please explain how that's not a problem either.
Your theories on the origin of this concern are childish and laughable - "Obama bad",  Calling me a racist would have been equally logically ineffective.  It's Libertarians that have raised this into the public consciousness, oh, and of course [Obama himself before he was elected](  Most of the people concerned don't blame Obama exclusively as the problem was not created by Obama, though he hasn't helped, it was created by statists on "both" sides of the aisle - it just so happens that there are "slightly" more on the left.  You're doing a great job of coming off as a left wing defender though and demonstrating the typical left wing ideological depth as well.
Please also tell me more about how central planning policies are working out for Europe.  IMO it's only the fact that we still have a "relatively" strong currency, as in the strongest of the weak, that we have not seen the kind of volatility that they have experienced, with likely more to come.  Wait until more countries drop the petro-dollar.
Let's also revisit this in December after the rate hike either happens or doesn't.  Either way I think we may see a problem.  If they raise rates the economy may start a harsh contraction and if we don't even more people will be spooked as to why not.  I wouldn't be surprised if there is some sort of major "event" before any rate hike actually happens to prevent it.  Perhaps another terror attack?
As you can see [throughout history]( fiat currency does not work.  The USD is not immune and IMO we will all see this clearly in hindsight.  Some of us can learn from that history and others cannot, so unfortunately we are all likely in for a ride.

I see you've tempered some of your sentiment and if you had posted more like this in your original post I'd likely not have posted my reply.
That said, I don't see the lie.  As I understand it, in US law we are generally offered a plea deal which defines our punishment but taking it or not taking it is a positive or negative crap shoot.  Prosecutors do use language like "you never know what the judge may decide, he may be having a bad day" if you lean toward your right for a trial.  Different degrees of that kind of language can feel like a threat and to an extent it is. That is likely what he was expressing with "It depends on how you define "threaten,"" so in my eyes that's not a lie.
Perhaps in Europe that kind of "explosive" is scary but we shoot things like that off all the time from practically the time we can run.  The fact that he was sleeping next to them is a testament to his mentality and that he likely was not considering it to be a real threat.  Had he asked a friend to store it for him without telling him what it was then that would be different.  Does this make it OK?  No, but it's hardly as extreme as you seem to want to characterize it.  He made a mistake, didn't intentionally put people in harm's way and as a matter of fact no harm was actually done.   
Also, it would take some serious work to rupture a gas pipe.  
All this talk of exploding buildings and planes is taking it a bit too far.  
Someone could answer their phone, veer off the road right into an electrical pole, it falls down and hits a gas pump and massive fire ensues, but suggesting using a cell phone while driving is similar to arson would be a real logical stretch.  So let's stick to reality and what actually happened, no explosions, no death, no falling buildings, flying bodies or crashing airplanes.  Just a box of firecrackers all of which carry the word "explosives" on the side, even the tiny lady fingers:
Edit: better link.

These are strange times for sure.  I'm right there with you.
I'll leave you with some Thomas Jefferson quotes:
Nothing is unchangeable but the inherent and unalienable rights of man.
A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government, and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.
Every citizen should be a soldier. This was the case with the Greeks and Romans, and must be that of every free state.
Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.
Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories.
Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.
The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.

So your PI can connect to and use 21.co's included micropayment services?  Please post a screenshot.
The proxy is not about hotel wifi access, though I suppose it could be used for that and it would be a valid use case because as much as people hate it, people pay for it, even today.  I imagine a better use case is for people who for example want to watch content on youtube, hulu or BBC4 etc. from a country for which that content is not available.


It potentially brings more people to the market who simply have to plug a device in to earn bitcoin, not yet, but if their take makes it into more devices like phones, tablets and TVs.  You could also use the mining chip to pay other people who run proxies and forward your traffic through them to receive a higher price for more anonymized surfing.  We don't know all the use cases yet as they are just starting to emerge.
Your PI and mining rig setup sounds great and that's an impressive use of that tech.  Ironically, some people might call it needlessly expensive and complex when you could just use an energy efficient heater and buy bitcoin from Circle for less than your energy costs you.  I'm not one of those people btw as I understand the other benefits of mining for yoursel.  But this demonstrates that the utility is subjective, just like with the 21 bitcoin computer.  Just because you don't see the benefit doesn't mean there is none.
This product has never been marketed to compete with dedicated miners.  It's a platform for innovation for which you are paying for their services and the convenience with your electricity.  If it doesn't work for you don't use it.

There is nothing inconsistent there.  Two separate points:
1. He made a return on his risky bet that Bitcoin would be something that adds value.
2. Alts have value, just not the same (yet) and I explained why.
You conflated both and then suggested I made the mistake.  You made the mistake by assuming that all alts offer the same value as bitcoin, which they do not (see hash power, network effect etc).


I'd wager that all of his profits came from someone else, just like all of your wages.  It's a pointless point.


And here is the heart of your logical mistake.  Does a person lose money when buying food?  Does a person lose money when paying for internet service?  Does an airline lose money when buying gas futures?  Does a person in Venezuela when buying bitcoin with quickly inflating Bolivars?  The same hold true for all fiat since they all inflate it's just less noticeable losing 2% buying power per year.  Did someone lose money when they sold Tesla stock at a profit at $50/share?

I think what is also happening is intra-day corrections and recoveries rather than multi-day.  Especially with new folks getting in (see Japan) I think dips are buying opportunities as their psychological level is being established in recent history vs. distant history.  Look at the big 1-day candles.  Every day without a cross day correction builds even more confidence.  This may very well be a one way chart for a while by comparison to history. 
This also may very well be the start of the big one, the cusp of the real network effect.
One more point, we need to remind ourselves that this is the 1st asset of it's kind.  Traded globally, 24/7/365 with no barriers separating participants.

It's an interesting theory except the hole I see in it is it's not that hard to cash out safely, though that's all relative to the resources dedicated to following the trail. They could also just sit on it until privacy tools are better.
The fact that there were only 3 addresses leads me to believe your second idea is more likely, or they had an outside motivation.  Clearly if it had an impact (the direct intent) the information would spread about payments not unlocking their data.  Seems self defeating unless that wasn't the real purpose in the first place.

I came back to post this link for you [serial number recognizing cash counter (transmittable via serial port)]( and I noticed that you already edited your post to remove the "unfeasible" and "preposterous" language you had originally posted.  So the backpedaling has already started.
Perhaps you want to step back from your general "can't be tracked" statement now?  
This machine shows that cash is feasibly trackable similarly to bitcoin via regulated points of control where the currency can be linked to identity, the rest being left to investigators/interviews etc..  The difference is that while bitcoin can be transmitted to some foreign country where regulation is not mandatory or to an unregulated autonomous digital corporation, cash cannot be.

Great comment.  I agree on most points.  I'm in a wait and see mode as I think there may be scenarios where things work out just fine and even a premium is negligible/acceptable.  It also may just be that this is a stop-gap to bootstrap the concepts.  They also may pull better chips from their back pockets.  Too many variables for me to be able to predict.
What I am encouraged by and I think is very positive is that the ideas seem to be flourishing based on the idea of making bitcoin somewhat of a computational unit.

I think the question is "Why can't it require that the output addresses stay the same and the amounts simply change?"  As in, the wallet reissues a new transaction keeping the 2 output addresses (seller and change) the same, but changing the amounts, seller address amount, change address amount and fee.
I can see no reason to explicitly flag the change address, though in a scenario like this where the fee increase was required it would be obvious as the amount to the seller would have to stay the same in order to complete the sale.
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:51:51


It can while it's charging.


Because you don't want to sign over your financial information and have it tracked, nor desire to potentially meet strangers that could be criminals or agents to buy it in person, nor is that convenient.  Instead you just plug it in.  By the way, I expect since the point of this device is to sell services that you could "sell a service to yourself" so to speak and load it with existing bitcoin.


Convenience, for a price, just like all other convenience.  You could go grocery shopping but some people chose delivery.  You could make all your meals, but some people chose restaurants or take-out.


Exactly, so it's premature to declare their hardware and software platform useless, certainly until some people get their hands on it and we give it some time to see what comes out of it.  The fact that Qualcomm and Cisco are backing them, and apparently understand their longer term play, I'd say my observations are more on target than "what a shitty miner".


I think you mean "appealing".  This is not the same as suggesting we listen to them because they are an authority, it's suggesting they likely didn't unwisely spend over $100m on mining equipment.


Not nobody, just not completely publicly visible yet.

You assume "he" is an individual intending to make money in Bitcoin, and you might be right but there are definitely other possible motivations.  Here are a few:
1. State actors looking to show Bitcoin in a negative light.  The code did originate with them and the leak now provides cover. (likely would backfire on them in the short term - see  - but might provide motivation for anti-Bitcoin action later)
2. Alt (any other potentially competitive investment's) investors with similar motivations.
3. Bitcoin advocates hoping to prime the market with new buys and grab headlines.
I'm not suggesting any likelihoods on these scenarios, just that we may not truly understand the motivation at this time.
Edit: Not directly related but sometimes infections serve as immunizations.  $300 is quite an inexpensive lesson for many, considering the value of the growing number of valuable items people keep on their computers these days. Understanding $300 is not the full cost if one already lost many valuables in this attack.  Hard drive failure happens all the time and most people I've encountered don't have good backup practices.

I wasn't asking regarding the law as the law is not absolute truth.  If you think it is then please tell me about the laws with respect to slavery, segregation and women's suffrage.  The law regarding these fireworks is clear and I never questioned it.
I never claimed he didn't break the law or that he should not have been punished.  I only commented to call out your exaggerations and it's clear from this thread that you've back-pedalled from your claims as you've been educated to just how weak these fireworks are.  You've refused to answer the key point with respect to those prior claims.  These could not blow up a house unless of course the house was already filled with gas in which case a simple match would have been adequate to set it off.


I never suggested they were the same.  The context was in response to you trying to justify that they were somehow not fireworks because they simply said "explosives" on the side, just like ladyfingers do.
The reality is that these are low power fireworks, yes explosives like almost all fireworks, but low power being the key, not high power like those required to take down buildings.

You suggested it wasn't fair. Same thing.  You're now trying to back-peddle by changing terms.  Sorry, not working.


Not singularly but in aggregate, as with most markets.


Sorry, not my job to educate you.  But since you missed it, bitcoin is a hedge against inflation.


My argument is that he made the money because of the risk he took and his ability to correctly predict the outcome.  Hashing has little to do with that.


If you don't think bitcoin is more valuable today because there are more people involved then you don't understand network effect.  Google it.  As previously explained, all everyone's money comes from someone else.  It's a pointless non-statement.  Your argument is really trying to suggest he added no value, which is also incorrect.

I suspect you understand my point, but in case you don't or for others, the issue was that your first comment was definitive and then when asked to explain your second was phrased as conditional.  Changing the second to also be conditional solves the inconsistency but means you are consistently being definitive.
It should be obvious that you can't possibly know for sure which side will be in the majority come Aug 1st, so you therefore can't possibly justify being definitive. (caveat: without a time machine)
IMO, therefore you should have instead changed the 1st comment to be consistent with the 2nd.

"The appropriate response is: "Bitcoin never goes up, only down."" - I think you meant something along the lines of "Bitcoin, like all investments does not only go up, it comes down.  See the chart for reference.".  I'm not sure if that's what you were going for there though.
And I'm not sure on this one but I think in this sentence: "If you don't believe that the Bitcoin will only work if you get rich, you should probably get out."  I think you meant to erase the "don't", but again, I'm not sure that's what you were going for.

By removing the burdens of government from our backs.  Think of the businesses that could be created if we were to return to a truly free market, this time global and free of monetary manipulation.  Think of the margins that would be possible if the productive weren't saddled with providing for the lazy, the bureaucrats and the corrupt.  I don't worry for the poor and disabled as there would be much more opportunity for everyone, and more charity.  The government is like the mob, a parasite that attempts to take all it can while not destroying the host.  I have no doubt that if humanity were unleashed from that burden we'd see something much closer to a utopian system.
As an example, the QEs collectively were a massive theft of wealth like nothing ever before it but most people don't have the slightest idea or curiosity about it.  Bitcoin's system almost completely eliminates the possibility of such a theft.

IMO if there is ever any real credible threat to bitcoin that the real Satoshi could do something about, we'd see something that looks a bit like [this](  The real Satoshi has the strongest hand and he hasn't ever been tempted enough to play it despite what others might have seen as credible threats.

I agree with the general sentiment of your comment but take a look at this chart: 
You can see from that chart that so far price has affected mining revenue more than fees.
Remember that energy cost in general is pretty flat, and now that asics are maxing out in terms of efficiency even moreso.  
I'm not suggesting fees an aren't important part of mining revenue, just that they are not required for mining to stay profitable if the price continues to increase.

Seems like a heck of a hypothetical.  I've read many stories where a merchant that advertised accepting bitcoin couldn't manage it IRL, so they just paid using another mechanism.
I agree there is an opportunity for a problem, but I highly doubt merchant services and wallets will adopt this feature by default, and perhaps not even at all.
Another option for them is to not show 0-conf RBF transactions at all.  When they receive 1 confirmation they show up...
I think people need to calm down.  If bitcoin is so fragile that an optional opt-in feature could wreak havoc then we've got bigger problems.  This is a minor technical complexity that is easily accounted for by the smart people writing wallets and merchant services.

Sounds like you're on a similar journey.  I found this a very interesting read as well: 
One of the things I appreciate most about bitcoin is how it essentially inspires people to research the nature of money and through that to ask even more important questions.  The whole thing seems to just unravel.  
I think Satoshi clearly is a genius, though I still wonder if it was even possible for him at the time to truly understand the implications of his manifesto, in particular the education part I mentioned.  In my opinion the educational and enlightenment value of bitcoin and the blockchain may rival the actual direct benefit of use of the technology itself.
That said, actually experiencing how you can instantly transfer wealth with no central intermediary for just pennies definitely is a catalyst toward the same end.

Funny there's nothing in there about the impracticality (and idiocy) of attempting to put all the world's trivial transactions on a single massively redundant permanent ledger.  What's wrong with that open letter is what it leaves out.
Core believes, as most technically competent people would and do (with respect to bitcoin and other situations that require scale) that you first optimize and improve the protocol, underlying network utilization, tighten your algorithms (as they've been doing which is what has allowed us to even reach this point), and then, if necessary, expand vertically and horizontally with brute force.
Also conspicuously missing was any talk regarding what SegWit+LN and other 2nd layer solutions bring beyond scale, namely better privacy, massive scale with minimum impact on the current infrastructure, secure near-instant transactions and decentralized ShapeShift functionality via [atomic swaps](  Scale via increasing the block size offers none of this.
It's antithetical to the idea of bitcoin to imagine it being more verbose than the existing financial system which has an essentially anonymous cash that can trade hands many times with zero trace.  To consider storing every triviality on the immutable ledger at scale is ridiculous.  We may need to increase the raw block size at some point to achieve higher TPS on 2nd+ layers, but first we should, as core has done, push toward scale with intelligent solutions that add other forward thinking enhancements.
Technically speaking, there is just no contest.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:18:49
Nice straw man.  You're the one introducing the word "only".  It's clear the plan is SegWit, then Schnorr signatures, and LN and a host of other scaling solutions that are made much more convenient with SegWit.  All the while we can entertain a raw block size increase and the most competent technical people will wage their vote as is happening now with SegWit vs. the latest incarnation brute force "scaling solution" to spectacularly fail just like it's predecessors.

Volatility is not good, it's just the nature of a relatively small asset, especially a first of it's kind.
If you want to experiment trickle in with a fixed small value purchase at regular intervals, like $10 or $20/week.
To get your train of thought going ask yourself what makes money have value and trustworthy.  Try to figure out the intrinsic value of gold and how a paper money not backed by an asset can still have purchasing power.
Then realize the very unique utility that bitcoin offers over other forms of money.  It can be transferred to someone anywhere in the world that has internet access using a simple app, without government knowledge, permission or control.  It can be backed up on paper or stamped into steel and stored in multiple places in separate parts that can be independent or require recombining.  It cannot simply be confiscated from your bank account.  It has an inflation rate that tapers to 0 and cannot be changed (short of massive self destructive failure).  You can accept it very easily and integrate it into your website without getting a bank account or permission.  You can write apps to do interesting things with it, like send it to your heirs after you die in periodic increments.  The list goes on and on. 
Think of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a platform for innovation that future financial assets will be built on, like all of the disruptive technologies that the internet has enabled, and you can see why it has such huge potential, unlike tulips which as nice as they are, can only do a few things which are not even unique.

Just like an non-technical manager.  You forgot 2 **small** things:
1. the part about the Hard Fork (you know that little breaking backwards compatibility detail)
2. testing (to ensure things like the cost of running nodes doesn't become prohibitive or orphan block rates don't further centralize mining etc.)
Both have huge implications.  Programming is not just about changing some code to make it do something different, it's about thoughtfully considering and understanding the implications of those changes.  This is why the debate should have been focused around maximizing transactions per second, the desired feature, and not block size, which is just one of many possible implementation details regarding achieving that feature.

There are people and businesses that don't have bank accounts for example, which is a different form of this same concept.  Earning and spending cash off the grid.  
There is also a path to cash via barter: object for bitcoin, bitcoin for object, object for cash, cash for object.
A global currency, even if outlawed in certain places will still have value, like drugs do.  
If we continue to have financial crises then even moreso.  People will flee a failing economy in any way they can despite what the law may say at the time.

I was simply trying to clarify the question.  That said, I think you're correct that unless there were somehow constraints on the amounts, potentially requiring the seller's address to be tagged as you said (so they could see that it couldn't change with a replacement transaction) then the scenario you proposed could happen. So without something like that accepting a 0-conf RBF transaction would put you at risk of losing the essentially the whole amount (except maybe for 1 satoshi).
I think there will likely have to be a setting in the wallets and in merchant software that will notify a merchant/receiver that a transaction is RBF and to wait for at least 1 confirmation.

A friend of mine in compliance told me there is no special number.  $10,000 or more transactions have to be reported but also multiple transactions adding up to close to $10,000 could also be, like 3 transactions for $3,000.  It's not an exact science which is why I mentioned "over some unknown timeframe."

So you know, this guy is a D'Angelo apologist.  I've also pretty much proven James uses shill accounts to anonymously argue his ideas rather than face criticism himself.  
If you care to go down the rabbit hole, here's a place you can start here:
Yes, I'm a bit obsessive about this subject but in my defense I just find James' "Congress of people" idea just crazy and it doesn't even solve the problem it intended to as having known humans doesn't prevent collusion or leverage.  His supposed face based identity system that somehow respected privacy (I never could get the details) was probably a very bad idea.  In the interest of better understanding it I tried to get answers from him but wound up responding to his shill accounts ultimately to have James admit he just didn't want to discuss his ideas with the "unworthy anonymous people" (paraphrasing).
I think there's something wrong with the guy.  Maybe a midlife crisis.  I do wish him the best though.  I did enjoy some of his earlier videos.

The crazy part is I watched a debate with Ver and Tone Vays and the moderator was just awful which essentially meant a completely wasted opportunity to get real answers or expose Roger for not knowing his stuff.  Ver was able to weasel out of sticky situations it and the moderator wasn't competent enough to facilitate and keep things on point.  The net was that both sides watching likely had their bias confirmed, nothing was really learned or changed.
My experience in software has led me to believe that "ambiguous" situations like this happen for 2 related reasons:
1. Lack of enough technical capacity to discern mediocre people from experts
2. Rarely do people get to experience the path they don't follow.  So they don't know the train that didn't hit them, or how pleasant the path they didn't follow could have been.
Bad developers exploit this, most often without even knowing it, and good developers rarely get recognition for being better as their clients generally aren't technically capable enough to tell the difference.  Most clients can't afford to have redundant teams competing so they could compare the results/costs/time frame etc. at the end.  If they could I'm sure it would be very enlightening and the result would be much more like meritocracy.
Somehow facilitating some sort of contest or challenge, with agreed upon rules, and goals where both paths are explored and analyzed, if possible, would be tremendously enlightening.  It's probably a pipe dream, but what I like about the idea is it's more data-centric than political and for example it could produce authoritative information that could be used to make much more intelligent decisions, especially for the masses that can't make sense of the propaganda.  It also ensures that each team has to prove that their tech works rather than simply claiming it does.  I'd much rather have folks voting on specs and capabilities than simply based on who's the most persuasive and then hoping for the best.
This in some ways seems like a hard fork - fork and see who wins, but we have to remember that without adequate information before the fork, the results may be just as irrational.  Basically better decisions are informed by better and more data.
Sorry for the long winded comment.

I think this answer, while simple, really is the long term solution and the sooner it's embraced the faster it will happen.  Fiat is a note used as a common denominator across services, a bridge between people with incompatible needs to be met.  The easiest, most anonymous and safest way to acquire bitcoin, not requiring that bridge and not requiring even your physical presence (required for BTMs and LBTC) is to do it via digital goods and services exchanged over the internet.  Like the comment I'm responding to this is pretty obvious, but I think people would do better to focus on providing value via goods and services in exchange for bitcoin rather than going through fiat.  This is also obviously not always possible as most people likely provide services in person and have physical goods to sell, so I acknowledge that.  But the sooner one starts thinking about what we have to offer that can be provided over the internet, the sooner they can engage in the stateless global digital economy provided by the invention of bitcoin.  I suppose selling physical items for bitcoin that can be delivered via post also seems like another good bridge that doesn't require fiat or physical presence.

There's no harm in hedging your bets.  I think that's what many people are doing and what is driving much of this alt rally.
Remember though that bitcoin has been time tested more than most others.  While not being 1st allows others to get the benefit of the trail blazed by bitcoin, and that's a real advantage, it will take a while for any significant transition to happen.  As long as you stay on top of things you can keep an eye on any such trend and act accordingly.  Remember too that currently the path from fiat to most alts requires Bitcoin.  Slowly that's changing with for example Coinbase enabling direct purchase of ETH and LTC, but you can keep an eye on that trend too.
Also, as Andreas Antonopoulos eloquently puts it (paraphrasing) the alt's haven't been scale tested yet.  They will all likely run into similar trials, both technical and political, if they see the growth required to put them in league with Bitcoin.

Thank you for the link.  I actually remember watching that at the time.  I remember it not being definitive, and now watching it again I see the same thing.
Toomim regarding the impact of slow pipes, specifically as affected by the great firewall of China:
"Obviously if a node is only downloading at 30 or 40 Kbps you're going to have problems, and we did have problems.  But only with the Chinese nodes."
"If we look at the Chinese nodes, we see all sorts of crazy stuff going on.  in this case it took 160 seconds to download the block because bandwidth during the entire time was very poor."
"So I look at these and I see that most of the rest of the world can handle larger blocks.  They can definitely handle 2MB...4MB.  *8 and 9 MB is starting to push it but I think we can do it.  China though cannot.*"
He also had most if not all of his nodes in datacenters as he said and he also showed that most had 50 Mbps to 5GBps connections.  This is the datacenter argument that most on the conservative block size side worry about.  Nodes in datacenters are more vulnerable than those at home running over TOR or VPNs (2 topics Toomim also didn't touch on).
Now he presented that the China problem could be solved by moving most of the block construction from China to the other side of the firewall.  Has that happened?  I haven't heard of it.  Assuming we can trust JToomim's information, that happening seems required for you to claim that "8MB all is fine".
Also, his node count was very small and therefore only in only a few countries.  This question seemed to express the same concern:    The results of his off screen test seemed to indicate that the internet was not reliable in certain directions ("Singapore still waiting, it hasn't even started downloading yet.") and somehow he just brushed the whole thing off as if he answered the concern, which he did not.
The net in my interpretation is that this proved nothing conclusively and opened up as many questions as it answered.

This is a crazy idea and I can't believe anyone could think such a thing.  Money is not the only way to exchange value, and there have always been various forms forms of money (precious metals, goods etc.).  If there were a "lack of ("official") money" people would still continue to add value but simply use other forms of payment, for example pure trade (good for good, service for service, good for service etc.)  To think that such a flawed assumption could underpin the Keynesian philosophy is nothing short of scary.

Understood.  While there may not have been any fundamental improvements to Bitcoin itself, the fact that the first LN transaction happened on LTCw/SegWit is big news that impacts Bitcoin.  Also Japan's recent stance on Bitcoin and Australia's upcoming drop of the VAT tax are pretty big external factors that could be affecting price dynamics.
In my opinion what **may** be different this time are small intra-day corrections that are quickly getting wiped out when the Japanese wake up and see a new buying opportunity.  This feeds on itself and each day that passes that we don't see a historical correction confidence builds.
I've suggested this for a while but at some point I believe there is going to be a turning point where there is a big run up and no correction.  This may be it or perhaps a mini one setting a precedent for the big one.

The rabbit hole could have important implications that spawn from either of those two outcomes and the "reasons" may have important implications.  He could have acted alone, together with a more technical person, as he suggested, as part of a larger team of developers and/or investors, he or others could have ties to other interesting personalities (or notable agencies or elitist groups), etc.  These are all things that may not matter but could.  As they say, you don't know what you don't know.
This is not merely "Gawker-style" spectacle.  If the original story is more true, a lone (or one of a small group) principled crypto-anarchist with a calm and cool temperament vs. one or more people of which Craig Wright with his sporadic behavior is one, it is certainly of interest to investors of time and/or money.  Understanding the underlying motivation is of great importance to me and I'd think most investors, especially if it turns out to be something other than what's in the whitepaper, the Genesis block and Satoshi's known written statements.
Clearly most would have more than a tabloid interest if it turned out that Satoshi worked with a team of 20 people and was tied to say the IMF, Federal Reserve or 3 letter agencies for example.

I'm glad it worked out, if not exactly the way you wanted it to.
I think it will be a while before BTMs can match the speed of ATMs.  Perhaps of LN or the other recent quick clearing technologies gain adoption we'll see it, but until then I don't think we'll see much of an improvement.  Certainly your experience was not normal or ideal.

I was pretty sure there's no way CW was SN but then I read this and a doubt emerged:
AVW: Why is Bitcoin not ready for mass adoption?
JVP: People do not understand what cryptography does and does not do. People do not understand pseudonymous. Having a key means you have a key. It does not mean you had it previously, or that you will have it in the future.
From [here](  I'm not following the rest of the argument there and some of the author's comments seem shallow, like the judgement of Craig's comments toward the end, but that one quote above and its context are very intriguing.
I've also posted recently something very consistent with JVP's comments, that my concern is that even if CW were to sign with an early key, he may have been given it by Satoshi rather than be Satoshi himself.  Of course in theory they may have been stolen from him too.  SN may have been found and the information extracted from him by force.

The left is so tolerant isn't it?  As long as you share exactly the same opinion.
Try r/The_Donald .   You might just get red pilled.  They don't exactly love Bernie, but perhaps this little exercise you just went through with this Hillary supporter can serve as an example of why it's good to hear other people's opinions instead of just shouting them down.
One of Trump's stated goals, if you can see through the smoke screen of monotonous Russian collusion, is to reduce the size of the federal government which serves many people's purposes once you stop and think about it.  Reducing federal power re-empowers states to define their own policies regarding say, drugs, marriage, taxation etc.  Let the left have things their way in their states, the right have things there way in their states and libertarians have their own bastions of freedom etc.  This allows people to vote with their feet if they don't like the way things are working locally.  Federal policies are harder to escape unless you can find a country that is better aligned to emigrate to that will have you and have the more serious resources required.
If you'd like banks to have less power, your probably better off with the guy fighting against the statists on both sides that have been buying votes and selling influence all at our expense.   Libertarians like Ron and Rand Paul have been calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve for ages.  If you haven't noticed Rand Paul has been quite cozy with Trump since the election.

That's what I'm saying.  It's not proof, it's a statement by someone who could have a lot to lose by not making that statement.
Sorry but your logic is a bit cockeyed.  I don't know for sure he's Satoshi, but there certainly are a lot of indicators that he is.

Dear zero-sum believer, 
Questions for you: 
1. If Bitcoin was only used in Venezuela would you still say the same thing?
2. Is farming zero-sum?
3. Is YouTube zero-sum?
4. Does fiat currency serve no purpose?
Answer those questions and you may realize that in order for something to be a zero-sum game it must be a static and closed system, something that solves no problem or an actual theft.  If someone breaks into your home and takes something from you that is zero sum.  If someone buys a service from you, or in this case tokens required to use a service, or that hedges inflation, or that allow you to cross borders with your wealth, that is not zero-sum.

You missed the point completely.  You won't know until time passes, as those that sold at $1,200 in search of $900 found out recently.
When you HODL you don't risk your BTC balance going down for the opportunistic hopes that it may go up (selling the peak and buying the dip).  If you're long Bitcoin you don't need to take that risk.
Btw, by trading you're also trying to somehow beat all of the fiat-BTC pairs simultaneously, and as we know, all fiat inflates regularly and at the whim of central bankers.

The ladyfingers link I sent you shows it also has the same "warning explosive" message on the side of it as do all products that contain black/flash powder.  For reference those ladyfingers are so small people commonly blow them off in their hands, yet they still contain that warning that apparently means so much to you.
The article you posted continually refers to the item Ver sold as a "firework" and "firecracker" and the only reference to "explosive" is in reference to the "explosive powder" contained within.  The same powder that is in all fireworks, including those tiny ladyfingers.  Yes, even ladyfingers are explosives. I'm not suggesting that these are not explosives.  What I am saying is to call them explosives in the way you are, wrapped in the context of claims like potentially taking down a plane or houses exploding or gas lines rupturing is sensationalist B.S.  This was not C4 or dynamite, it was nothing even close to that realm.  It's much closer to a common firecracker than it was to any serious explosive.  The firecrackers Ver sold, according to the article you provided, actually contain only 1/3rd of the powder of an American M-80.

You answered your own question.  "As of now" is quite a qualification.  Also, that's not all it's doing, it's providing bitcoin to people so they don't have to get it via other means that are still less convenient than just plugging something into an outlet.
~~Your spending a lot of your time railing against~~ This is just a development kit that does not represent the eventual use of the underlying hardware and software coupling that 21 has created.  Eventually we will see other devices, like for example TVs that pay for their own subscriptions via electricity (certainly easier for Mom to setup than a raspberry PI or even saved credit card credentials).
The wallet comment points out that at one point we had only command line wallets.  Now we have fancy more simple to use phone based wallets.  The same type of argument "As of now..." could have been used.  This is a step in a direction, not meant to be an end in itself.

I remember reading about that.  The two things that strike me as odd about this clip of audio are:
1. that when Wright implies that he proved ownership of some of the early addresses his statement goes unchallenged.
2. the part where the cryptographer brings up taxes.  It was as if he had a bone to pick and was not being impartial.  His job should have been easy, confirm the cryptographic aspects were real.  It should never have gone to the whole discussion of taxes.
It would be nice to have had a more professional person there so it didn't escalate.  My guess is that provided cover for Wright to bail out and it was a shame to give him that out.
I'm also utterly confused how the roles seemingly flipped with Wright suggesting that signing a message does not compromise the address while the cryptographer was suggesting it does.  If anything you'd think Wright would have used that as a reason not to provide proof in the form of signed messages...

Perhaps you're late to the discussion:
"What's the reason?
If you say "He's satoshi!" then I hate to be the one to burst your bubble, but he's not..."
This was the declaration, as if it's fact.  Yet the only thing that has been posted to justify this authoritative declaration, and not even by the original author, is "he denies it".
By your own "logic" the burden of proof is on to justify his authoritative declaration.
I didn't take an authoritative position, I simply asked for the reasoning behind the authoritative statement.  There are many indicators that tie NS to SN.  That's not solid proof, but there is also no solid proof he's not.  A denial is not proof.
By the way, suggesting that the rules of law with respect to innocence, and a generalization at that, where there's been no assertion of crime or criminal punishment, is not valid logic, but that's beside the point.

Thank you for posting this.  First, your observation is great.  This is what should be happening on our financial news stations and is not.  I think that will backfire on them eventually.
I put on subtitles and auto translate and despite the less than great translations I did take away a new and interesting observation. We always hear "Be your own bank" and think of it from the perspective of not having to be subject to bank fees, rules, compliance etc.  We also have heard about banking the un-banked from the perspective of those who live in unstable economies or governments.  The new concept I think being discussed here was simply convenience.  Some might live far away from the closest banks, or not have cars.  So despite having a stable economy and even banking infrastructure there may not be ample banking penetration.  
I think this is a pretty interesting concept to consider.  Participation in the economy is now no longer limited to the those within reach of traditional banking.  It is now extended to those within the reach of the internet.
Edit: translations not transactions

Powerful argument.  He denies it = not him.  And that argument somehow puts me in a position to prove he is.
Simply consider the reasons why someone would not want to admit being Satoshi and you'll see how invalid your "proof" is.

IMO wealth distribution is not really the problem.  The problem is that we have power brokers who facilitate and expedite inequality via legislation and clearly cater to people who can reward them, those that have more money.  I mention this as I think it's important to focus on the real problem, government power, crony capitalism and other political corruption.
Blaming wealth inequality for the problems that arise from government is like people trying to blame bitcoin for the drug trade.  They've got it backwards.
Bitcoin should help prevent theft via inflation, injustice via bailouts and maybe war if more people start using it cutting into the government's ability to fund it's whims by creating money out of thin air.

No, but one can catch a scammer in mid-scam instead of allowing the opportunity to go home and think about ways to explain away his scammy behavior.
Ideally, it would have been better if Gavin was better prepared (and motivated) and caught him with the reused signature.  By the time he got to this interview he was likely armed with many different possible sleights of hand and argument tactics.  Similarly it would have been better for the crypto-expert to not have brought up Wright's taxes thereby giving Wright an out.

Let me help.  Investors generally don't love high volatility (unless there are financial derivatives available to allow them to make money on the volatility - that aside...) except if it's mainly one way, for example like pre-IPO/early GOOG, AMZN, TSLA...
Also, "I thought the point of Bitcoin was to create a currency", well that is part of it, but ask yourself why Satoshi front loaded and tapered the inflation.  To incentivize speculators and grow adoption.  At this point a significant amount of Bitcoin's value comes from speculators who are specifically looking for growth.  A flat horizontal line would not work.

Look at the 12 hour and 6 hour charts though and the range of the candles from 5 - 10% on a given day.  I think we are getting pullbacks they are just wiped out by new entrants picking up "cheap" coins.
Another observation I have made is that Bitcoin is wave 1 and it takes a ton of time to even scratch the surface of understanding it and growing comfortable with it.  I think what we are also seeing right now is a wave of people that have passed the hurdle of bitcoin and starting to branch out into wave 2, alts, while yet another new wave gets up to speed with Bitcoin etc.  
As the overall CC market cap grows we get the benefit of collective network effect and building credibility.  Lots to be positive about right now.

I see now that you didn't mention time because the comment you were responding to didn't mention it.  I think they were likely implying the present but did not explicit say it (though of course they may be of the opinion that bitcoin will only ever be a store of value, which in theory could play out as well).  I can see how that would be confusing.  Sorry for the snide tone :).
Btw, IMO if bitcoin itself doesn't serve the un/underbanked, clearly some similar coin/technology will.  The savings produced by removing counter-parties is too great to be ignored.
That said, I think we'll see the same sort of patterns with bitcoin that was saw with mobiles.  Writing to the permanent ledger with every little transaction is necessarily expensive now with all the new adoption and activity, especially since it's likely significantly more transactions are about  investment (speculation on the possibilities) than actual use.  It reminds me of the early mobile use which was very expensive, per call flat charges and rated by the minute, not to mention expensive monthly recurring charges.  That made it useful and provided a return only for those that could justify paying high prices.  
This same pattern has played out for many technologies.  Another good example is comparison to the early internet.  At one point it too was slow and hard to use and few people used it as it couldn't do many of the things we do today due to lack of adequate capacity.  I think we are like the Internet somewhere between 1993 and  1995.  Over the next 5 years I predict we will have significant improvements to scale and significantly less complexity in terms of user experience.  Both should help open up bitcoin to new sets of users.
Lots of parallels.

I may have misread the OP but considering (s)he's asking a very basic question (where can I get bitcoin) I thought it wise to make sure the OP knew not to trust a paper wallet generated by anyone else.  My wording could have been clearer too as the transfer is not the issue, the generation is. 
I would also think it's better advice to a person new to bitcoin to do the to paper transfer personally.  Imagine the OP, if a n00b, meeting someone with a whole paper wallet (both keys).

Been in bitcoin since CPU mining but think anti-establishment is a bad thing?  That's inconsistent.  If you don't like it's anti-establishment why not just use establishment fiat?


This makes no sense.  You made true statements but concluded that means bitcoin is sketchy.  My point is that it's no more sketchy than fiat which has the same "problems".  So if those are reasons to be cautious about Bitcoin you should be equally cautious about fiat.  This invalidates your argument unless you are also advising people not to get into fiat anymore.

I'm not sure if I'm adding to the discussion, but I think is suggesting that looking at the large transactions it probably makes sense to consider those as "many transactions" each.  For example a transaction with 100 inputs and 1 output, or 1 input and 100 outputs, is it just 1 transaction or is it 100?  I think in a traditional system like credit cards we're generally talking 1 input to 1 output.  So to make the apples to apples comparison you need to consider the transactions with more than one output and/or input differently.  Making it more complicated, multi input/output transactions could be a single person moving their own coins around.  Or it could be aggregated deposits to an exchange (I think), so it may be hard to tell the "true" number of transactions in the traditional sense.

You are very rational in my amateur judgement :).  I admit I must have read too much into your comments.  
I do disagree maybe just a bit on the faith part but it probably depends on the definition one uses.  At a certain point even science is faith or at least needs qualification as it holds within the bounds of whatever system we live in, and it too can give people a false sense of reality.  Some might justify horrible behavior based on assuming we are all just atoms that can be scattered to the wind without thought.
I've been comforted in my life to see things that confirmed to me that some/most humans can be good despite their own self interest which gives me faith that there is a higher meaning, though that may just mean someone programmed us that way and nothing more.  It comforts me to think there is some force that drives us away or counters the ugliness that we've seen emerge at points throughout our history.  The trend seems pretty positive amidst the chaos.  But again that may not actually mean anything.
Thanks for the response.

I think the Japan and Australia news and recent run up that cannot be ignored might make this time different.  It's also built on a slow steady growth base of 2016 and bitcoin has a solid 8 years under it's belt.  Not to mention SegWit and LN getting tested on a production chain.
Check out the [coin.dance LocalBitcoin charts]( almost exclusively steadily increasing.

Exactly.  
What they needed to do is sit down with core developers and their own trusted developers (quality really matters) for hours if not days and hash out the technical considerations, come up with a plan for testing different varieties of solutions on a variety of test-beds that all parties agree on (for example taking into consideration weak links, great firewall of China, slow/expensive upstream bandwidth) and then execute.

This was my point.  Where you seem to disagree is apparently whether investors add value.  Do you understand the futures market?  Do you understand how derivatives provide actual value?  Some would naively assume it's all speculation and to a degree it's true, but practical examples can help shed light on the real value provided.  For example an airline will buy oil futures to hedge against fuel prices increasing. This allows them to operate with costs "fixed" rather that to be at the mercy of a volatile fuel market.  Companies that hire internationally will buy futures contracts in foreign currency for the same reason.
Without even getting into futures/derivatives it should be clear that investors provide needed cash for capital and other investment to help companies expand at hopes of providing greater return.  To suggest investors didn't earn their reward when their investment works out would be a ridiculous assertion.


What in your experience leads you to suggest that investment has anything to do with "fairness"?  Also, please define what's fair.  It's a subjective term.  I'd also bet that if you were the one that risked $1000 on unpopular "fake money tokens" back in 2010 or 2011 you'd think it was incredibly fair.


First, I don't have to prove anything, but I'll assume you simply worded this poorly.  Whether price drives hashing power or vice versa it's all voluntary and more to the point more hashing power means it's harder (for outside parties) to take over the network via (non-aggressive acquisition of) hash power as it introduces a significant cost.  The caveats are there based on our newly highlighted knowledge of very real threats, for example China co-opting mines or mining power via force, leverage or incentives, or just bad players making bad decisions.  These threats apply to other crypto-currencies, though likely in differing degrees.  There are also of course different value propositions that alts serve, for example the clearly popular privacy coins, that are showing their value in their price, but that's a different discussion.  I've not asserted alts are not valuable, just currently not as valuable and some reasons why.
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:43:06
Amazon is not profitable either.
It's a matter of the time horizon.  The Chinese are apparently not trying to run a profit in short cycles, rather long cycles.  Whether that works out or not remains to be seen but my vote is it will especially when you consider the capital controls factor that others have eloquently brought up (opportunity value to convert to a portable currency).  
As for whether it works out for Amazon, I'm not quite so sure.

@_date: 2015-10-24 21:46:32
Apparently this is the fundamental difference of opinion:
"cheap and quick value transfer"
"adhoc permissionless finance"
I suggest you look into what the decentralized part brings to the table, as that's what makes bitcoin something new.  While settlement is relatively quick that's only somewhat important for some subset of use cases.  It's also not particularly cheap to put all entries on all ledgers (the cost at the moment being paid by inflation).  That substantial cost is the price paid for the true goal which is intentional decentralization.
Once you realize this intentional decentralization is what makes bitcoin unique, and that without it it's just another database, you may start to turn.  
To me this alliance is like a post-Troy Trojan horse, completely obvious yet somehow being entertained.  Once transactions are regulated you may as well be using another payment mechanism.  The banks seem to already be heading toward improving settlement times and likely costs in response to Bitcoin. So you could just use Dimoncoin to meet your needs.
has it figured out.  
This is also an ironic statement "by those who wish to politicise bitcoin".  The idea is to keep it free from politicians, and history should convince us there is no middle ground.  All they need is a foot in the door, like in 1913 with The Fed and the federal income tax.  Governments never cede ground voluntarily.
All that said, IMO none of this matters.  What Napster couldn't win, Bittorrent won.  What we are debating will likely only affect if Bitcoin will be the winner or just the first.
In closing, you might want to also consider the amount of crime that predated bitcoin.  It all happened and continues with fiat and the current banking cartel.  I don't think this is really about the tiny fraction of crime that happens using bitcoin and it's minuscule $4B market.  It's about control and protecting the status quo.  Once again regulation in the name of safety but in reality as a tool to stifle competition and freedom.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:10:48
I agree. 
Also, the more infrastructure that is built on top of it the less likely it is to simply disappear.  That's yet another thing that the current state of affairs is holding back.  
We should activate SegWit as it's a next logical step toward bitcoin as a technology supporting other layers of  technology.  We've already lost first move advantage on SegWit+LN.  At bitcoin can remain in the mix if we activate soon.  A shame we will be following instead of leading.

@_date: 2017-05-07 04:36:45
And that is what we call a classic straw man argument.  For your point to be logically valid you'd have to ignore the fact that there is step 1 of the most widely tested scaling solution already deployed widely throughout the network and supported by the majority of the bitcoin community, awaiting activation, and that step 2 is already being actively developed by 6 different teams and is being widely tested on the testnet and soon to be LTC network and others.

The point is that the status quo is known to be working security-wise.
I'd also suggest that Nick Szabo was not making a general statement.  It's clearly in the context of the current block size debate.
Are you opposed to SegWit+LN and if so why?  Seems to be a safer (security-centric) way to improve TPS, with backward compatibility and new capabilities we cannot get otherwise, namely secure instant transactions and true micropayments, all while allowing tends, hundreds, thousands to millions of off-chain transactions to compress down to 2.
Most "small blockers" acknowledge there will likely be raw block size scaling, but that first we should fix issues (TX malleability) and increase the efficiency of block use (Transaction Weights), and see how 2nd layer solutions like LN impact the transaction mix and on-chain transactions, before doing raw block size scaling.  This seems very sane.  Before doing horizontal or vertical scaling it's typical to ensure your algorithms are efficient, otherwise you waste resources and in this case those resources are both highly redundant (multiplying costs) and permanent (my coffee transactions don't need to live on forever).
So IMO the question "Should we increase the block size?" should have been either bounded by time, asked relative to protocol fixes and improvement or both.  IMO the answer is SegWit+LN (and other 2nd layer concepts reliant on the TX malleability fix) first, then if required block size after that.

First, wi-fi already manages this ad-hoc, allowing the user to choose from many separate channels or let the hardware auto adjust to the least noisy channel, and UWB has a spec for online registration to allow people to register and deregister with a geographic area as needs change. Last I checked into that it was a while ago, but the point is that there are usually technical work arounds rather than requiring a bunch of bureaucrats to do something mechanical and granting them corruptible power.  So your statement is false.

@_date: 2015-02-07 10:20:41
I agree with some of your points and identify with your sentiment, but I think you may be missing some important details.  Bitcoin unlike Paypal cannot be stopped.  There is no central party for the DOJ to drag into court. So it can even be declared illegal (a stretch) but so are drugs and they are still everywhere.  The government cannot stop new versions of open source software from coming out or effectively stop people from running it on their own hardware.
IMO fighting for less regulations is worth doing but adoption is more important.  I also agree with some of the comments here that we should probably discuss these things in private.  So far it looks like the horse is being rolled in, not that there is really the option not to.  Bittorrent is still happily running despite the powerful interests that have actively tried to stop it.
The other interesting thing is that as adoption and awareness grows IMO it will be harder for governments to stop bitcoin as it would be an admission that it is a threat which is like a big red flag advertising that the jig is up for the incumbent financial players, exposing the raw underbelly of the beast and shaking confidence.  I think this is where that Gandhi quote rings true.  If bitcoin weren't a real threat and the supporters of the existing system were confident in the rightness resilience and power of the old systems they would simply ignore bitcoin like we ignore ants.  We don't need to laugh at ants or step on them, we just ignore them.  That's not at all what's happening.
My favorite part of being a spectator of the recent regulatory action is watching these tools suggest that they are enacting legislation to protect the public.  They're completely transparent and I see fear in their eyes.

Again, I'm not in disagreement with your sentiment or think you are wrong, I just think it won't matter.  I have made countless arguments to state and regulation worshiping friends outside of the bitcoin space, so you're preaching to the choir.  I could never make the case to you for why regulation is a good thing.  It's not.  I agree it would be better if it were possible to avoid the regulation.  I just seems like it might be a necessary evil that also btw turns out to be completely innocuous because of the nature of bitcoin, opensource and code in general.  And, I think one of the greatest benefits and justices is that we all get to see it play out.  We get to see statists invent new creative reasons why this technology and the citizenry needs the "help" of government.  They claim to be putting protections in place here but then ignoring abuses in the traditional financial sector.  Those unavoidable facts can be used to sway even more minds, which is really more important IMO in the long run.  I predict it may even be a net positive, so the benefits in what it reveals will outweigh the hurdles it presents.  That's just my opinion though and believe me, I'm right there with you.
Regarding the exchanges, it would be nice to have them but we don't strictly speaking need them.  Any person with any form of money can be an exchange.
I think we should all sit back, participate by enlightening people to the benefits and slowly opening their eyes to the more philosophical points and watch this play out.  It's going to be very interesting.

Let's relax and not get carried away.
You seem equally quirky as you are apparently fixated on Ver for making a minor mistake where nobody got hurt.  It happens all the time and there are plenty of cases where people do get hurt.  Perhaps your time would be better spent taking up those causes.  This just seems petty.

Do you mean this part? My reddit formatting is not showing up for me.


If so, I think this means that they acknowledge that licencees while responsible for reasonably preventable things like direct transfers from their custody to a known terrorist, cannot control what happens once the currency is back in the control of the client.
There's a somewhat interesting related topic.  I wonder how this applies to businesses that offer multi-sig services for example, since in some cases the idea is for the end user to make direct transactions from their web wallet to whomever they are doing business with facilitated by the licensee.  It's not that interesting for the mainstream case as if one was funding terror using a hosted wallet that would be pretty weird, but the legal subtleties may surface at some point if the regulators are expecting businesses like that to somehow keep tabs on some more loosely defined rules.  For example, could they expect a business to block transactions to Julian Assange?
Btw, I'm not a lawyer.  I just got tired of reading all these posts about how someone will summarize it, so i did it. :)
After reading it through it really doesn't seem any more burdensome than what any Bank likely has to comply with.  That said, and along the lines of what Andreas has said, this technology while overlapping is not the same so treating it the same will stifle innovation.  We don't even know what it will become so trying to bucket it into an old mold doesn't work.  IMO they should have let it run free like the internet for at least a few more years.  
We all know why they are not though, and IMO they are fighting a losing battle.  Imagine we could 3D print cars (I know it's been done, but I mean for real, in our own homes).  Consider how the incumbents would stop that.  As a practical matter they couldn't.  I like the idea that these old school regulators are letting themselves think they are in control.  Flexing their regulatory muscles and granting themselves rule over the landscape.  At some point, hopefully soon, the rug will get pulled out from underneath them and they'll be exposed for exactly what they are, based on what they contribute to human progress and productivity, negative value.  Good luck making a living with that to offer.

"doesn't increase the value of your **Bitcoin** holdings" FTFY - those clearly increase value provided or protected.
The majority of everyone's money comes from someone else.
OP was smart enough and risk tolerant enough to have invested in Commodity X before even many of the people here.  Buying futures in Commodity X, a "potentially" popular useful commodity serves the purpose making that commodity's service more visible and supporting it's ecosystem.  OPs risky bet was repaid in higher Commodity X price (per fiat).
This scenario plays out for thousands of Commodity Xs in the form of new products and service offerings.  With bitcoin there was no capital raise, formal angel round, no IPO etc. just early people seeing it's potential and risking their hard earned money to buy/support it.  They have been rewarded for their  foresight, accuracy in prediction and risk.
As for Alts, while I agree they serve a similar purpose, they are not secured by the same amount of hashing power, nor as widely known and accepted.  They have not stood the same test of time and attacks and survived (many have in fact failed).  So they are by no means the same.

Seems more like a PayPal scam than a Bitcoin scam.  I would think CCN would have focused on that.  BTCLowen seems to have compromised enough PayPal accounts to accumulate at least $23,000 of BTC and to purchase advertising.  So I'd suggest a new title to CCN:
"BTCLowen exploits PayPal vulnerability to defraud customers and vendors of goods and services."
Also "Pro Bitcoin Scam"?  Does the "Pro" mean professional or "on the affirmative side"?  Seems like CCN has some work to do in that department.

Unfortunately your point seems lost to most.  
I'm in 100% agreement with you.  This technology should be spreading like wildfire.  The problems with passwords are equivalent to the problems with credit cards.  They have to be entered and transmitted every time they need to be used, and they need to be stored.  BitID and other similar technologies like  should be taking off but I can't find anyone using them.
They are also perfect for bitcoin businesses like exchanges where a user's identifying information can be simply their public key.  
Not only does this solve the username/password case but it also solves the issues around registration and email based registration validation, and the associated centralization concerns that come from that.
Registration and Login are as simple as scanning a QR code - done.  On mobile it's even simpler.  Click a link, app quietly and quickly launches and then disappears - done.
The first email provider, exchange, marketplace etc. that implement this technology will get my business.

I think you need to consider where the costs come from regarding remittance businesses.  Likely much of it is in government compliance which is where you seem to be concerned.  How do you make sure that the money sent from the US to Africa is not for an Elephant tusk?  Your Bitcoin version of Western Union would have to handle the cost of that regulation.
I'm also not just concerned about the financial regulation.  I'm concerned about any regulation as that is the foot in the door.  If you want a currency that will comply with "law" as if that can be generically defined, then you already have that, you should just keep using it.
Bitcoin, to me, is about truly free trade, not as defined by governments to be from country to country, but from man to man as free voluntary trade should be defined.  It's nobody's business what one man decides to trade to or from another man for his effort, labor and property, just as it should be no man's business to force another man to work.
What you are hoping bitcoin will be is a contradiction that can never be, regulated just perfectly to suit your needs.

Why would you assume the issue you had, requiring 50+ confirmations and still not releasing your funds, would be "the same or very similar" to other ATMs?  To me that would seem to be some sort of failure case, not a success case.  If all 2-way BTMs were the same, there clearly would be no market for them.
Some other statements you've made are also not very good assumptions:
"The whole process took about 5 minutes which I believe is a normal amount of time for a fiat ATM as well" - To withdraw cash from a fiat ATM takes under 2 minutes if not 1.  That said, there are very different things happening behind the scenes and I would think at this stage most people doing a BTM withdrawal would understand those differences at least at a basic level.
"Most people who go to ATM's don't have the time or the patience to wait ten minutes or longer for the transaction to confirm." - Chocked full of assumptions.  ATM user != BTM user.  ATM != BTM.
Please keep this post updated with your resolution.  I hope you get your BTC back.

Core has a solution that is already deployed on 65% of the nodes awaiting activation.  This solution is already in production on Litecoin.  They also have a large majority of public support: coin.dance/poli .  BU has less than 5% of nodes (now that the Sybil attack has failed), low community support and while they have a nice chunk of hashing power, that likely has more to do with a centralized player wielding too much control and by his own admission holding back technology that works against his interests (in his own mind).
To blame for the stalemate on one side is ridiculous.  It takes 2 to tango.

Most people's home routers already have the needed capability to support this idea.  People with older routers can find routers capable of running generic firmware for around $20.

You're probably right. Banking is saturated too (in the US).  So were postal delivery options before FedEx.  So was telecommunications before the internet.  Hotels were saturated before AirBnb, Taxis were everywhere before Uber.
Don't run one, nobody's trying go convince you.  But some people might just do it since it's essentially free and provides a service, just like the networks of free community wifi that is available in different locations throughout the world.  This is just another way to decentralize something that was previously centralized.
If you don't understand progress and decentralization and the difference it makes I'm not going to try to convince you.

I'm afraid that even if he does move Satoshi coins he may still not be Satoshi.  For example, lets say the real Satoshi who clearly does not want to be known for obvious and good reasons were even to provide Craig with a single early key (what's $22k to Satoshi?).  It serves both of their purposes, the real Satoshi remains hidden while reserving the right to come out of hiding at a later date. He could do this by signing with more early keys (say 10 to Craig's 1) and with an explanation.  
While this is slightly far-fetched, what we see happening here is already a bit nuts and if Craig were to "prove" it after first trying to "scam" it, I'd be more inclined to believe the scenario I outlined than he's actually Satoshi.
Add to that Nick Szabo has been inactive on twitter for just about the same time since Craig's promise of proof and you have a nice conspiracy theory.  Btw, has anyone seen/heard from Nick via another forum?  Eth folks?

But not in the case of serials flagged via bank robbery, right?
Every time I've made a withdrawal lately they counted it with a counting machine.  Having that machine equipped with an OCR mechanism and automatically tying those serials to the current account at the terminal doesn't seem unfeasible or preposterous.  Perhaps you can elaborate on your declaration?
The OP speaks about different mechanisms to completely avoid the points of control, such as exchanges or hosted wallets.  For checks (you mentioned depositing) and cash (you mentioned withdrawing) there is a point of control, the bank.  By the way, they already monitor your deposits and withdrawals, same as is possible with bitcoin, though perhaps today with less granularity (serial numbers).  The bank is also currently responsible for reporting loosely defined "suspicious" activity such as movements of thousands of dollars.
To correct your statement, cash is perhaps slightly more anonymous in some ways and slightly less in others.  It is perhaps slightly more trackable in some ways and slightly less in others.  Those dynamics can easily change with new regulations and protocols (cash and bitcoin).  So your implied statement "bitcoin can never offer the anonymity of cash", and (unqualified) "Cash is anonymous", "Cash can't be tracked" seems way off the mark.
Please provide something more than a declaration.  Simply stating something doesn't make it true.

I upvoted your first two posts.  I'm just chiming in since I've seen a similar pattern before where any form or magnitude of religion is tied directly to lack of rationality.  Anti-religion can also be tied to a lack of rationality.  The fact of the matter is that no one has a complete understanding of the origins of the universe so to rule out a creator (sure you can find all the inconsistencies with a literal reading of any religious text) as if we have the full picture is just as much an ideology.
We could be a biological experiment of some higher being, a software experiment, a figment of the imagination, a simulation... we don't know at this point and perhaps we will never know.  To assume you know definitively that there is no truth to some of the high level ideas brought by religion (that may not be what you are doing) is to be just as indoctrinated as those that believe in a higher power.
I prefer humble skepticism to all forms of dogma and can see the possibility that science, evolution, the big bang theory etc. can be consistent with faith in a creator of sorts.
FYI, I'm not a churchgoing person and fought as a child (successfully) to avoid the light indoctrination (CCD) that I was exposed to.  We rarely attended church and don't even regularly attend on holidays.  I can just see that anyone pretending to know something so large and so definitively is not really any different than those they are bad mouthing.  I prefer to identify with those that have a that humble skepticism and who can therefore discuss the whole universe of possibilities.
There's plenty of bullshit being pushed on our children in public schools.  It's just not religious bullshit (if you don't count Islam), it's leftist and statist bullshit to grow them into being good little citizens of the state.  Some that choose homeschooling are doing it to avoid that and of course the mediocrity, rampant sexualization of children and of course the early exposure to drugs.

All technologies have growing pains, including the internet itself.  If you define Bitcoin as solely what happens on chain and not to include the 2nd+ layer solutions then you are right.  Bit that is sort of like saying that the internet doesn't support streaming video, Netflix does.  Not a perfect analogy but hopefully you see my point.
SegWit is Bitcoin and LN is Bitcoin.  Once we implement the other layers we will again have lower fee transactions but serving our now wider audience.  This will be an ongoing challenge as blockchains are inefficient due to massive redundancy.  Bitcoin without 2nd layer solutions is like the internet without packet switching.  It could never live up to the promises unless it remained very small.  We want it to grow so we have to evolve the technology with the demand.

I'm not sure.  Like I mentioned, it's just speculation, but if they do make it live at Bitstamp then I expect it will get a ton more use and testing and therefore will get more hardened. I imagine they could limit it to very small transactions (under $10 for example) but that's just more speculation.  We should know more this week.

Yup.  What's your MTU setting?


If the internet safely and economically supports capacity increase, as it is expected to in the future, bitcoin will increase the block size.  Pretending it's permanent is a straw man argument.  The reason it's contentious is that we have not reached critical mass in terms of being able to fight the coming onslaught so redundancy and across regulatory domains should be maximized .  Once we do reach critical mass and ample tech evolution (upstream bandwidth, CPU, memory, storage) is available more economically, increasing the block size will no longer be contentious.

How much gold to you own? Who do you think owns it generally speaking?
AND, again he's not advocating for high fees, he's simply pointing out the idiocy of people who insist that without very low fees Bitcoin is doomed.  Even with high fees it's very valuable.  Still, lower fees are preferred and Segwit+LN will help to get there in a long term way as all from 1 to thousands or more LN transactions can be compressed down to 2.
In order for this tweet to upset your sensibilities you have to not understand quite a lot about the current state of Bitcoin.

The UI is pretty straight forward.  You can choose to trust them to hold your coins or you can "withdraw" them to a non-custodial wallet (a wallet where you are the custodian and you must safely backup the keys/seed).

Now imagine it didn't have packet switching and all packets went to every user.  That is the equivalent to on-chain scale where every insignificant transaction is sent to every node.  LN is analogous to introducing packet switching.

It seems they are also fighting a barrage of low ratings due to people not understanding Bitcoin and the way fees work.  I bet that is causing much of any present financial problems they are experiencing.  
I think a language barrier may also be contributing as some of the responses could be better.  For example this would be much more effective: "For more information on bitcoin fees please visit bitcoinfees.21.co".  Instead they are trying to answer all in the ratings comments.
Along the same lines I see some people having trouble with their integration with Simplex (I known nothing about them).  Negative experiences there are translating into bad ratings.
It would be great to be able to offload some of their support headaches in lieu of ads.  Any ideas?  Maybe a dedicated subreddit?  Might unfortunately be an opportunity for people to scam new users though...

Extreme example, but perhaps you can explain what a compromise would have looked like between the Allies and the Axis powers in WWII.
Sometimes compromise is not the right answer, especially when you are "negotiating" with people who have shown to have no regard for anything but their own interest and/or if they are irrational.
Scale via optimization first, scale via brute force only when absolutely necessary.  This pattern can be seen all throughout the tech world, on the internet.  Especially when scaling via brute force threatens the integrity of the system via significant impact on it's resources.

The point is there are times when things are uncomfortably awkward with new technology and especially as demand outpaces scale.  We are there right now with Bitcoin.  The state of the internet was not "doomed" in 1993 despite being able to make very similar assessments, quite the contrary.    Unlike the internet in 1993 we have a choice between 2 plans (expressed in terms of the internet for clarity):
1. Upgrade the entire network since every "packet" is sent to every node which requires a much greater investment in hardware for everyone.
2. To introduce software based packet switching which will allow 1000x scale recurring transactions (and likely non-recurring down the road) while not increasing the demands on the underlying network whatsoever - which is especially important for Bitcoin as it's adversaries are much more powerful and can clearly see this coming (while with the internet it was likely much harder to see and very hard to stop).
So my point was, to complain now about Bitcoins congestion is analogous to complaining that your internet is too slow in 1993 and therefore doomed, which is obviously ridiculous.
As for losing to the alt-coins, they'd have to have better scaling plans and/or better security and they'd have to overcome bitcoin's network effects.  Can you name one that does, because if so I'd like to buy some.

The quote wasn't the whole of what i was referring to.  The context was more interesting.  If I'm interpreting it correctly (may not be), JVP is suggesting this is an intentional mistake since he's actually trying to prove he's not Satoshi.  I know it's confusing and I clearly have no idea, but it's such a crazy thing to think that anyone who knows anything about encryption would think they could fool everyone so I'm looking for other possible explanations.
This in no way would suggest he is Satoshi, it's just interesting to try and consider all the different reasons behind his actions.
If I were Satoshi, I would never want anyone to know under any circumstances.
Regarding control of the wallet, that's indisputable, but the question of who Satoshi is is related but independent of who controls the keys.  That was the point of the specific quote.
Btw, I said a doubt emerged.  I didn't say I believed he was Satoshi, just that it introduces another thing to think about amidst this strange riddle.

IMO all these sites should start using BitID, BitAuth or SQRL.  For the life of me I don't know why nobody does.  These use the same iron-clad security as bitcoin and can allow (optionally) the same pseudonymous identity Allowing you to prove you are the same person that logged in before without associating that to your name or even email address.  
BitID is built into many bitcoin wallets already.  Exchanges should really be using it.

The first purpose of LN is to move recurring payments between known related entities, for example exchanges and their clients, retail establishments and their regulars, businesses and their suppliers, mostly off the block chain.  This can support a tremendous amount of use cases that allows that type of usage to grow exponentially.
AFAIK the case you outlined is not yet covered unless you want to agree upon a LN node to use and open a channel there, which is probably not a practical solution for one-off payments.  I fully expect there will be innovation on top of LN and other Layer 2 solutions that will start to address that issue.  In the short term LN will help by alleviating on chain utilization making transactions on chain "cheaper" than they would be otherwise (had we not moved recurring transactions off, not necessarily cheaper than they are today).
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:45:21
So lets make a parallel to a fictional internet that currently requires everyone to run a fat pipe and all data to go to every user.  You have two possible directions:
1. Force everyone to upgrade their hardware to support 2x, 4x etc. the bandwidth. (Let's not even consider the simplicity for 3 letter agencies to monitor all traffic for now)
2. Introduce software NAT and packet switching which allows magnitudes more traffic on the same hardware, private traffic and requires no hardware upgrade.
Raw blocksize increase is  SegWit+LN is comparable to  and it seems to be the right direction.

Your example seems to leave out that many alter-nets of sorts exist and there are many efforts to continue on that tradition to decentralize and/or revoke such control that is currently granted to ISPs.

The envious do tend to have a chip on their shoulder.  In this case the magnitude seems pretty important to the content and situation, and to get the attention of those that can remedy the situation.  But you let envy get the better of you.  While this post likely elicited empathy in many people in this community, you took it as an insult.
If you had faced the same situation with say $20,000 ($130 of 2011 bitcoin), I'm pretty confident you'd have mentioned the number, not for the sake of bragging, for the sake of fact.
I hope you take the feedback and do something positive with it.  IMO, Bitcoin, as is much of life, is not a zero sum game.  If you're unhappy with your lot in life then take responsibility for what you can control and do something about it.  What others have has nothing to do with you.  For all you know the OP has decades of work under his belt that you don't yet have.
Envy will never get you anywhere positive as it essentially boils down to an excuse to remove yourself from owning your life.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:00:56
I don't think you have the information necessary to determine if price is moving into alts for utility or for hedging against something happening to Bitcoin, whether for this scaling "debate" or for the fact that it's the most likely to be attacked, regulated (attempted), or for example miners nationalized.  
In other words, there are many reasons that people are reaching out into alts, also including since some people like to buy "lower priced" assets in hopes of exponential gains.
Your comment singularly assumes it's moving due to high fees for transactional use.  Clearly there are many other possible reasons.  Clearly this accounts for some percentage, but that definitely does not tell the whole story.

Perhaps an analogy.  The internet was useful when it was simply connecting a few like minded academic types.  It became much more useful when it not only supported them, but also early tech adopters, early online businesses, content creators, streaming radio, video chat, streaming HD movies etc. and disrupted monopolistic/oligopolistic incumbents along the way.
In the case of Bitcoin, clearly it's use as digital gold is the most important and unique feature.  Via scale (safe scale that does not threaten its primary unique value proposition) it will reach more and more users over time (safely), which will increase its utility and therefore value.  
Will there be competitors? Yes, and throughout history that's proven to be a very good thing, especially when you and your immediate competitors are really competing with a monopoly/oligopoly that has been proven to use force to maintain their position of power.

What your taking for granted is that these other cryptos will be able to withstand the pressures with respect to security and scale that Bitcoin has already withstood.  Some may, and they all benefit from  having faced those challenges already, but many people will prefer the coin with the track record to one without.  The first mover advantage is also a first move lead.  It's harder to overcome and not knowing the future, for example a potential catastrophic failure of another coin, it's hard to know how it will all pan out.
