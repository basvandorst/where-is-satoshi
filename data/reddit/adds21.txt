Software engineer.  We have a small office with about 5 of us in, 3 of which hold bitcoin.

We have the gdax screen on a big screen in the office! :-)

I bought a small amount of BTC for my kids for Christmas (which a view for them to hodl for years).  My 12 year old liked the idea, and bought a little more back in January (at around $1,200 I think).  I'm hoping it'll pay for their university fees :-)

I bought 7.5 Bitcoins in January 2015 for around $2000 because I thought it was the future of money.  So far, I'm really happy with my life choices.

I don't disagree with you, but at the end of the day, most people don't want to be their own bank, just as most people don't keep all their cash under the mattress, and will trust the bank with their money.
I think it's fantastic that banks are even thinking about this.  Just because they offer it doesn't mean you have to use it, but if my bank offered a BTC wallet which ran along side my fiat account, so that any balance in either could be accessed in the other, I'd use it like a shot. If I wanted to spend a large amount of my BTC I'd simply transfer it to my banks wallet, and then have the local fiat amount available.  
Where do I sign?!

I bought both my kids a small amount of BTC for Xmas 2015.  My oldest (now 13) has been really interested it in (although, I wouldn't say obsessive), and over the last couple of years has bought some additional BTC with Xmas and birthday money.  It's held on my Trezor and I've always been very careful to make sure he understands that he could lose it all, but I see no harm in either of my kids having an understanding of cryptos, or finance in general.  With luck, by the time he's 18 it'll be able to pay for University, or a deposit on a house... as time goes on, that becomes a real possibility.
