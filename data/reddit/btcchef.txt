Your entire criticism has been semantics for the past 5 replies. If debating the definition of something that has multiple definitions and contexts isn't arguing semantics I literally have no idea what semantics means.
You have yet to attack successfully my assertion that nobody, in the real world, establishes and verifies with certainty that there was no "taint", fraud or graft in the life cycle of the asset they are pruchasing. Its just not done. To suggest I'm a deviant or sick person because I don't do this is completely unsupported. Its an ad-hominen attack at its core and its flimsy as hell because as I stated it applies to everyone. I'm glad you spent so much time studying my throw away account. I'm very excited to have your free psych evaluation as well.

I'm well aware purchases don't have a carfax history or chain of custody which is why I suggested, I don't spend 6 months investigating my purchases to establish them and neither does anyone else. Chain of custody is used in many contexts sometimes not in the same semantic phrasing. It just establishes exactly what it sounds like, a record of who had control of an "asset" and when. Chain of custody is used for important documents, possession or title of property(like a home or vehicle) and for handling of evidence in both civil and criminal cases. 
I'm not sure how any of this has anything to do with "my character" since I haven't heard of anyone that uses yard sales, auctions, ebay, or craigslist spending copious amounts of time investigating each of there purchases to ensure there is no possiblity of fraud. Do you do this? How long does it take you to shop for groceries? How can you be sure that can of corn wasn't stolen off the back of the distributors truck or the manufacturer wasn't shorted his rebate by the retailer? Can you be sure the net 10 payment terms on the invoice were in fact paid on time and the credit applied to full balance? How can you be sure there was no graft?

Tortoises move very slow and outlive just about every other animal on the planet though they are in competition for the same finite resources of food and shelter. Maybe an apple and oranges analogy but maybe not. Bitcoin is not crippled, there hasn't ever been a time with more activity. reference git hub, bips, academic papers. Your perception it is crippled comes from what exactly, you are upset it isn't evolving in the direction or speed at which you prefer? Well sorry, thats why the market is good because if you prefer rapid evolution  in a specific direction I'm sure you can find an alt pool to play in.

If you are talking about the blockchain transaction fee only maybe.  This is dishonest imo... As it is only one of the costs involved. There is the on boarding cost to buy it.  There is the carrying costs to hold and store it.(price change etc) There is the costs of turning it back to usable fiat on the receiving end. How can you ignore these costs especially in a million dollars transactions?

yes I did, I described another context of chain of custody implementation used in title control over assets such as cars and homes. chain of custody is just the documentation of custodial control. That is all it is. You can apply that to literally anything. Sure there are specific procedures and standards for this depending on the use case but its the same purpose. Verifying custodial control of something to establish its integrity(reduce fraud) Why is that so hard to understand? If you think about it, bitcoin is a chain of custody medium, people are actually working on the problem of moving asset title systems to the blockchain. 
I don't care what you equivocate purse with. Purse is a website to purchase things for bitcoin. Period. Its not inherently good or bad. Good or bad actors can do good or bad things on purse. Just as they can on any  platform for purchasing things.
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:00:41
It is absolutely semantic, even the wikipedia article states "in the legal context" implying there are multiple other contexts in which the concept of chain of custody applies. Which is to say establishing a history of custodial control is used outside of evidence collection. Which is to say a record of ownership or handling of an "asset" any asset in any context can be described by the term chain of custody. Why do we have car and home titles? Its simple, its a means to track and trace custodial control over large assets. 
Your assuming though that there cannot be fraud or graft involved in a grocery store&gt; just because its not in an alley way, how can you be sure? 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:56:07
You are getting lost in the details. 
Can we bring this back up a level to the op please?  You seem to disregard their ability to accurately profile despite the overwhelming evidence in the op which shows they have the ability,  they are doing it and they are wildly successful at it.  Can we start there please? I don't need to answer how because we starting from the point in reality that they are,  as stated in the op. How is moot.  They are, profiling . 
So assuming you have been profiled because it is already demonstrated they can and are good at it. It's trivial to obtain cooperation because as stated your a soft target for them. 
So what's left to argue here is a matter of opinion on how slick you think you can be versus how soft you actually are.  It's debatable but let's just say they have a 30% success rate of gaining cooperation within  the first 8 hours of interrogations.  That's a pretty good success rate to justify the effort.

This is exactly the activities being discussed on op. 
Check my other posts. It would be trivial to obtain cooperation once enough evidence has been collected and coercion begins.

Its interesting you think debit cards are accepted in many parts of the world that remittance is prominent. If it was just a matter of a debit card then bitcoin isn't needed at all.

Oh yeah but you are slightly misinformed,  they just have to have enough evidence to strongly suspect that you have the coins then they can rely on the time tested methods of interrogations, coercion and leveraging your loved ones for the rest. You haven't described yet how you bypass those methods? Encryption won't work.

Rich and educated can't manage to keep bitcoin secure what hope do the poor have?
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:25:36
If you invent something you can call it whatever you want and tell everyone else to pound sand. It's one of the perks.  Give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:41:39
Its pretty simple actually because they could fix the bug and fork the chain. I would still retain ownership. There is no scenario where the block chain dies completely. As a bitcoin fan you should know how anti-fragile it is. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:31:32
How did they profile the people in the op? I imagine they can do the same,  starting with blockchain analysis,  bank records,  and btc exchange subpoenas.  Then they can get warrants to search your home,  phones and computers.  Then they can get your search history and email history. This is all trivial they do this all day.  Did Snowden teach you nothing? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:21:16
Good luck with that

giving up? a bit hyperbolic to say its giving up because the pace of evolution isn't what you prefer. The github history shows many extremely talented folks are contributing amazing this at a faster pace than ever. If their is truely such "urgency" to evolve or die then maybe bitcoin isn't what its cracked up to be.

@_date: 2016-08-04 20:43:07
You are so missing  the point.  They needed to have coins on the exchange in order to enter their trades. Your coins give you to leverage  margin on your positions . That's how it works.

This actually isn't true at all. Read up on AWS security, its clear you haven't. They have options up to and including dedicated racks with key wiping controls if the physical rack is breached. AWS has put together world class security controls, you still have to take your head out of your ass to use them effectively though. You can be assured that there is no datacenter more audited for security than AWS.

Wasn't the op exactly about profiling? When you have all the data how hard is it really to profile bitcoiners? Why would I need to get paid to point out the silly fallacies being spread. Bitcoin is a lot of things but it definitely isn't the end all against motivated government adversaries

Build a wooden canoe and paddle out to sea then boot the computer.  Also if you're threat model included state level adversaries you have no chance.

Virtually none of those apply to average Joe. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:48:00
Arguing lexical semantics is arguing over definitions. You say I'm wrong, I say your wrong(support it with wikipedia) and other contexts (car titles - conceptual context - different lable - same meaning - implementing chain of custody to establish ownership of large assets to avoid fraud) and you disregard my counter evidence. This is now a 'meta' semantical debate. We are now debating whether or not we are debating semantics. Just saying someone is "wrong" doesn't win you the debate unfortunately.
Your entitled to feel there is a high risk of fraud and danger in purse, ebay, craigslist, flea markets, grocery stories, walmart...whatever you want. Its your opinion. Doesn't make me a bad person for using those services.

True and ultimately people will "vote" with their money. Whether that means staying with bitcoin or moving on to another blockchain. I hope the cream (bitcoin) rises to the top but I won't be devastated if it doesn't because ultimately I can move my coins at anytime to an alternate.

Scary that you made it so far as to own a trezor but have no idea how to use it or how it works 
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:37:12
Well here is the deal. There is an active investigation. You only hear about other real world hacks a year or more after they happen. So at this point you are already the most informed customers in the history of large hacks. so yeah cool your jets, you did after all place your trust in them in the first place. Its almost as if you'd prefer to be doing business in some regulated industry. :) 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:56:24
no no this is the standard line we use when there are bank hacks. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:02:53
I don't envy this Zane guy, as a class of customers, bitcoiners have to be the most entitled and obnoxious.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:40:42
Seems to be that people screw it up all the time. And again you haven't explained how you convince an average Joe security isn't a concern
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:39:45
I don't think the long term trend lines have been broken. But again if you zoom in or out enough on a chart you can make it say what you want it too.
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:38:04
No thanks,  better things to spend energy on in crypto 
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:02:43
Using any of the means I mentioned to collect evidence. Once you have enough evidence you try to elicit a confession,  of that doesn't work you lay on the coercion a bit thicker. Probe around some soft targets close to them,  friends and family.  Find a pain point and press until they fold. Geeks and hobbyists fold the fastest.

@_date: 2016-06-22 02:04:22
Its not out job to convince you of anything .  If it's not for you then all we can say is thanks for trying it with an open mind.  
But just as thought experiment,  outside of sizeable amounts how would anyone prove a wallet was in your possession for specific transactions that created a taxable  event?  It would see to me that there would not be that capability or resources to do that. Because as we know bitcoin is fickle technology,  coins are lost and stolen all the time.  
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:13:20
Journalism?  That's generous. I can't recall the last time I  saw real bitcoin related journalism. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 23:52:26

Why is this chart important? 
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:13:25

I'm confused here, whats stoping someone from making their own ERAD at home then? Reading this makes it seem that anyone with the right software can seize anyone elses assets. This story is missing all the technical details that make it worth reading.

I still think you are missing the larger point here. There is no centralized authority, we are all here voluntarily. We choose to stay or leave based on whether we continue to see value in this network. That is it. There are no other assurances or guarantees that need to be made beyond that. 
If miners fork to reduce fungibility, you can leave.
If miners accept bribes, you can leave. 
This is a freemarket.

Without assuming wide spread federal conspiracies the logical reason for their success rate is they only move forward with prosecuting cases they know they can win in order to be able to intimidate defendants into accepting plea deals based on a perceived/real success rate that is insanely high. This makes sense as they have a ton of cases to prosecute and not enough time to take them all to trial. For better or worse its what we are stuck with.

Call it what you want. Thats how it is designed to work. In the case of bitcoin, there are some changes that just would never be adopted because they would inherently weaken the value of the network for all participants and people very rarely act against their own best interests when money is on the line. 
Something like introducing coin white listing is one, changing the 21m coin limit is another, and reversing transactions is the third. There is nothing stopping someone from forking the code any time they want and changing whatever they want and calling it 'bitcoin the next generation'. If users follow them thats fine, competition is good. 
So maybe you should make your own charter and when bitcoin fails to uphold the most important principals to you, you can liquidate your holdings and move to another blockchain that suits you.

His meal was shit that is all he knows or cares about. 
Customers do not care why your food,  product or service is shitty.  They want a good food, product or service without any problems.

ok well I always thought of assembly as human readable mnemonics for machine code. Like I said when I'm dealing in assembly x86 ASM designates 32 bit cpu where ever I've seen it referenced and x64 ASM designates 64 bit. Thats why it was unclear from my perspective and I know enough assembly to not be a fucking n00b either. So if it was unclear to me it was probably unclear to alot of other people.

oh so let me try and get inside your train of thought....europeons/UK are going to wake up and Realize they are/aren't living in a post brexit world. The first thing they will do is take all of their cash and send it to a bitcoin exchange. (I mean this is obvious because everyone knows bitcoin as this completely viable get rich quick machine) Then they will wait for their cash to clear a couple days and proceed to buy bitcoins like their is no tomorrow. Is that about it? Seems sensible, reasonable and likely right?

Just a thought exercise here, there is no reason that one miner couldn't mine transactions at $1,000,000 per coin. THe protocol doesn't care about the price. I think what you are saying though is that as the value of the network scales does the mining have to scale in order to prevent someone from attacking the network. However this cale is not 1  to 1. I'm not sure wher eyou got that idea from. Nor am I sure about the assumption that electricity consumption is inherently evil, it would be a matter of perspective on how that energy is being created and delivered to miners.

You can mitigate that at any time by forking to a more suitable code set. That is the only mitigation needed. Judging whether or not their is actually a weak link is an individual decision as is the decision to participate on the network or not. You seem to believe they hold some superior influence.

I need to comply because if not I get kidnapped by armed agents and thrown in a rape cage. That is called coercion. Your confusing going to mcdonalds, there is nothing compulsory about going into mcdonalds. Its a voluntary relationship for both myself the consumer and mcdonalds the proprietor. Both parties can voluntarily leave the engagement for any reason what so ever. THere is nothing voluntary about being born a tax slave and being forced through coercion to give up 1/3 of your income for "services". In fact, the government is making it more difficult than ever to renounce citizenship levying even more taxes on your way out! They have no choice though when you have been operating so ineffectively and running up enormous expenses with no end in sight the only choice is to find more ways to steal more money.

doesn't mention anything about 64 bit processors though so you can see why I would take it in the strictest sense. Most people reading the article and headline wouldn't understand the nuances of cpu architectures. It is an important distinction to make that it does impact 64 bit processors and 32 bit or just 32-bit.

Incorrect.  Money laundering is not a crime in most places and wasn't a crime in the USA until the 80's. (it's mainly used as a crutch for lazy law enforcement) Without a victim there is no crime. I'm not a big fan of blindly obeying, you clearly are but Hey diversity is a good thing.

I asked what was wrong with it and your whole argument was on the assumption that it's wrong cuz government said so. This attitude presupposes the superiority of the government and their decree.  That's horseshit. The government said black people were worth half a white not too long ago also. Maybe I'm asking the wrong question,  why should money laundering be illegal and who are the victims. Before you answer there are no victims less crimes, If there is no victim or victims for the accused to face in court how can their ever be a fair trial? Just look at the name of the crime,  how does someone do money laundering to someone/something else?

Some people are trying to build services *today* that require larger blocks *today*.  They will ultimately build those services elsewhere if they can't build them on bitcoin.  That is the strongest argument I can come up with.

Being that u mentioned military in your first sentence indicates you didn't even read my responses previously.  The military industrial complex is basically a monopoly and privatization isn't practical and couldn't compete.  I don't see why communities couldn't or wouldn't come up with voluntary crowd funding of security. After all if they don't have a third of their income jacked they would have extra for this. Fire departments are already voluntary and what can't be could again be crowd sourced from the community/. Roads and infrastructure are shitty(by me at least) and are a perfect example of government waste. 
Highways could be privately financed/operated and funded through tolls.

If you have extremely small size say 50k in your portfolio, 1% would have gotten you a couple of coins last year. a couple of coins over 30-40 year timelines (timelines used in any retiremine scenario) could ammount to signficant monies when its time to cash out.

If you want to argue semantics instead of seeing that the article presumed everyone had a deep understanding of x86 and intel architecture thats on you. They could have been more explicit and made it clear to all audiences. If you want to argue that I'm stupid because of this have at it. It's not crystal clear and that I'll stand by. 
When I'm talking about x86 its in terms of binaries and assembly and cpu registers, again its a 32 bit or 64 bit designation in my mind. I understand very well that 64 bit registers encompass 32 bit registers which encompass 16 bit registers etc etc. Its just not how I'm used to designated things. You win at SEMANTICS OK!?

Speeding the example is quite poor man.. The victims are the people in the roadway at the time of the occurence represented by the police officer that is also on the roadway issuing the tickets.. Speeding is infringing in someone's right to travel being threatened by someone abusing their privileges (not a right) to drive on a public roadway. A vehicle becomes an uncontrollable 2000 lb projectile at certain speeds and road conditions,  they are the number one unnatural cause of human death.  Very tangible and measurable consequences with very tangible and measurable victims. Guilt is also not assumed for speeding whereas it is for money laundering. The equivalent would be getting busted for arriving earlier to your destination than normal, you must have been speeding!  So on those grounds I'm against it because it assumes guilt (I have to prove my money sources are legal)  and there is no tangible victims or measurable impacts to society.

How do you activate it if it's latent you can't be hidden and remotely accessible. Even locally, the ME invisible to the installed OS.  I see what you mean mean I think like you add a registry key and the firmware finds it it activates. But,  this too makes little sense to me because if you have low privileged access already its fairly trivial turn escalate without the help of this hidden firmware 
Also the article doesn't know jack shit about making processors,  it isn't just  flipping a bit or two,  what you have been discussing is sophisticated software/ firmware that would be hundreds of lines of code at a minimum ,  there isn't anyway in the high stakes world of processors that this major change goes unnoticed. You would need at least two people highly placed, one to approve the change one to make the changes.  Not that that is impossible in itself but I'm certain it's actually not that easy either. I mean it would easily fail the checksum in a basic qa. 
Also every root kit has this same low level access so I think you are glorifying this,  it isn't one of a kind. Full access at all levels doesn't imply its been programmed to make use of everything,  even if it uses existing OS system calls it needs to be programmed for that specific OS,  which means any patch puts it at risk of failing.  For example lets say it targets manipulating lsass on Windows,  it has to know how to access the functions in memory for lsass,  ok possible of the memory offsets and pointers are always easily found in a relative space but what of Ms patches lsass and all the relative functions offsets change? Well seems your master plan is foiled by Patch Tuesday.  The other possibility is you have generic low level drivers to interface directly with the hardware,  now you are running an OS hidden from the other OS,  how this doesn't create crazy unexpected  performance issues and errors seems like magic.  Assuming it's possible and reliable tho,  how does one sneak in an entire low level operating system.. Idk.. I guess a hypervisor does sort of this but thats millions of lines of code probably 
Just want to be clear I wouldnt say any of this is impossible but there seems to be seriously diminishing returns compared to the alternatives.

Not exactly that easy tho.  You are skipping quite a few steps.  Most importantly it would 1) need tailored software to be able to probe your specific OS and retrieve the targeted valuable data. 2) it would need to receive the command to execute this transaction 3) it would need to bypass any perimeter defenses that could prevent exhilaration.
None of this is trivial or a simple five minutes of Pounding the keyboard Hollywood hacker movie style

Well you are a bit confused.  Evidence need not be refuted during a trial. Lack of refuting evidence doesn't validate either. A guilty verdict is for the given charges.

Wavering on how to respond since you opened with ad-hominen. 
For someone so wealthy and intelligent,  and serious about security; it is quite interesting that you or anyone lucky enough to associate with you is completely blindsided by the generally accepted notion all systems are hackable.  It is also quite surprising that an advanced and brilliant mind like yours hasn't drawn parallels between this vector and every other back door.  Specifically,  that back doors need to accept an input and return an output in order to be useful.  This indicates fairly simple mechanisms like firewall rules could completely thwart such a backdoor.

Yes and no. It would seem easier to just plant an employee in the target directly to steal the keys. Easier still is to do a usb drive by on the target machines while everyone is gone for the day. The risk of exposure seems to sky rocket the more complex the op is. If you think about it, putting the rootkit on every device and keeping it running all the time, its going to be exposed and mitigated in a week. A huge investment with a high risk you become exposed before you even get the goods. Why risk it when you can O-day their router and have free reign on there network *quietly*.

Your points are correct, offline machines and ephemeral os aren't going to be a 100% cure, like I mentioned nothing is unhackable given motivation and time :)
There is no perfect security so it will always be a trade off with the goal of reducing attack surfaces as much as possible. In this example I can imagine some basic firewall rules could mitigate this vector entirely :) 
I think for common users of bitcoin the message should be kept simple. Keep your keys offline :)
Given the much more attractive targets (every corporate or bank datacenter in existence), I would like to believe we would have seen this vector in action by now if it were as viable as they make it seem. Every back door still needs to take input and produce output for it to be useful. This seems no different which means you have at least two opportunities to stop its utility at the network layer.

You keep repeating yourself,  but you are confused about the role of evidence in a trial.  Evidence isn't proven or disproven.  Evidence is presented to a jury who evaluates all of the evidence against the charges. They don't go through each evidence and check a box that says proven or disproven.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding.  The fact some evidence was presented has no merit outside of the context for that trial.  The guilty verdict has no merit outside of the charges and cannot be used to validate the merit of some or all of the evidence presented.

It's called a three way handshake you either speak tcp and can respond to a syn packet or you don't.  There is no conspiracy here. It's defined in the tcp protocol.  
Also says right in the wiki you linked ME isn't supported by all ethernet adapters. It's not supported in all bios either. Makes sense since ME is geared towards enterprise and I'm not running enterprise hardware in my home.

This feels a bit like a moving goal post let me first discredit the article:


No it doesn't. This would show up in security scans. Also of note it can bypass local firewall to the host only


get out your jump to conclusions mat, how they leap from someone was able to paritallly control ME on early models to this is a huge threat is a bit crazy. They go on to contradict themselves here getting confused about whether the ME firmware can or cannot be modified from the native OS. THere are equally good or better opportunities for rootkits on modern hardware utilizing the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) to load bad binaries during boot. 


I can't disable it but I am somehow to believe it can easily be reprogrammed. ok..


They go on to say there is actually like I said checksums and hashes that get calculated. 


Basically, they've taken all positions so far, it can be hacked its a huge threat, to it can't be removed, to it can't be changed. 


Again, nobody but boing boing author is actually taking the position that this is an incredible threat.
So lets look at the pieces of the puzzle here, the firmware blob gets placed onto the chip during fabriation. This code cannot be readily edited due to cryptographic security. 


Hashes at build time have to match hashes at execution time. This is important, probably the most important reason why this isn't that attractive of a vector because as I said, one change to the native OS and the firmware blob no longer works correctly when interfacing with it. 
Some other things to note, because they can't prove that it "is not" doing something doesn't serve as proof that "it is". Meaning they have no evidence it can act as a keylogger . They have no evidence it can read an interpret the windows file system or access the hard drives directly. And as far as I'm concerned they don't substantiate in any way their claims that it can run a TCP/IP server. 
Theoretically they can have in the firmware run whatever kinds of code they want so long as it fits the space given to the "blob" but as stated this code would need to be hashed and signed at fabrication time and cannot change. I don't think you an create a code base that is universally useful as a rootkit that fits in the chunk of code allowed by the "blob" So it would need to be targeted. It would not be able to have advanced features that you see in most C2 botnets today. It would need to be activated locally. 
None of this is to say I support the closed to audit ME system. For security purposes we should know exactly what its capable of. But I stand by my opinion this is more FUD than fact.

@_date: 2016-12-05 17:12:35
It is unreasonable.  You could have stopped there. A backdoor that cannot be updated and cannot receive commands is definitely easily discovered and thwarted. Meaning it isn't an attractive vector. Meaning it's use is highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:14:15
Well that's simply not possible unless you plan to send packets to a host located on the same broadcast domain as the victim by passing the perimeter firewall entirely. Meaning the firewall may only permit outbound to a specific ip,  meaning if your ip isn't on the permitted list the packet gets dropped. Of course a firewall doesn't protect all vectors don't be silly.  
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:29:37
That web management interface is NOT on by default.  You have to enable in the boot options.  Also,  the OS is completely relevant,  hasn't this discussion been about compromising the OS or the data on it utilizing ME?

I'm still unclear about how one would program this remotely.  You would either need to do it during fabrication. Ya right. Or reprogram it with physical access to the device and specialized equipment.  This seems the highest hurdle and definitely seems nation-statish in execution and not rogue employees.   This all seems null and void to me because if you control the fabrication then (duh)  root kitting is a piece of cake and you can do it any number for of ways.

It's highest risk because you have to either embed the bad firmware during fabrication on all devices or you have to update the firmware with physical access to the device.  The former would require quite a conspiracy at the chip manufacturer. The later would be over kill because you already have physical access to the target.  
Also by deploying it all machines during fabrication you cannot control which ones you want to control you have to control all of them and filter out the real targets.  When you have essentially a massive botnet you can't hide it.  If you can't hide it,  then it will discovered and mitigated quickly, making its value low. 
Also as stated simply owning a machine isn't useful if you have no way to reliably exfiltrate your data. You can theoretically program the firmware to identify network traffic patterns and try to assimilate into normal traffic but now your firmware will be growing exponentially more complex. That's going to manifest itself in unknown ways and lead to its discovery. 
This is all theoretically possible but it's alot of effort with no guarantees. Once it's burned its worthless.

Wouldn't make it useful unless you know what the internal ip ranges are going to be. Unlikely.


Yes you could serve http over UDP, it would be completely unreliable ( not good for web apps or any apps really) But the http protocol is still http protocol a Get HTTP /1.1 request over UDP or TCP should generate a web page if the webserver speaks http. NMAP isn't a black box of mystery it just automates protocol compliant packets. 


I thought I've refuted this but it doesn't actually have full access. As stated in the wiki and article it has ring 3 access, highest is kernel ring 0. Also, I thought the wiki made it clear that it doesn't have direct access to the disks. It has access to the memory and to some compatible ethernet adapters, keyboard, usb and display. Still powerful but not that earth shattering.


I agree it is interesting vector and maybe I'm wrong and its far more devastating than it appears.

The risk of hack is very low since the funds coins can all be offline all the time unlike an exchange where they have to have a warm or hot wallet to support withdrawals.  So in summary cold storage and off line storage reduces the need to worry so much about hackers.

Coinbase doesn't get to determine what a sale is lol,  who told you that? If this is the technical approach  ft.  That the irs plans to take,  they will have circles run around them.  If they can't prove a primitive understanding of Bitcoin or its use cases the judge will blow them out of court before they even get to opening arguments.

Again,  coinbase doesn't get to define what a sale is for the sake of compliance or any other reason.  The irs needs to substantiate the source data.  Coinbase said so isn't substantive.  Again,  it takes just the most primitive understanding to realize a transaction isn't a sale by default. 
You can feel free to Google the irs site,   
"a sale is generally a transfer of property for money or a mortgage note"
It's not just a transfer,  it's a transfer to some other entity in return for money or note. So coinbase calling it a sale doesn't make it so unless they also have proof it was to another entity in exchange for money or note.

Society wouldn't be crippled because this vulnerability isn't special.  Organizations institute mitigations at various layers to prevent such things. An appropriately configured firewall for example should mitigate most any backdoors. However,  generally speaking,  since users aren't high value targets they can mitigate just about any vector buy keeping there keys out of reach.

@_date: 2016-12-05 14:03:05
You actually don't know what you are blocking because this is all theoretical. It would take the time and motivation of a nation state to pull this off and even then I'm skeptical.  Because if you are a high value target that would be subject to a nation state attack you have other network defenses that would interfere with its utility as a backdoor.

Without knowing the OS ahead of time you can program a generic memory scrapper sure.  But you are going to have a Helluva time deciphering the constructs in memory to find what you are looking for. If you're objective is to simply dump the full 8gb of ram to the network and analyze offline and hope you strike gold it's not going to be really effective time wise. 
But all this already assumes you have direct access to program the ME firmware anyway,  which hasn't been proven YET to be a thing. Let alone programming it remotely.  
All of this also assumes there is some covert channel implemented to exfil the data as it would seem to me a pretty easily thwarted attack with just a few firewall rules.

Intent to distribute has to do with the number of bags not quantity.  For example if you have an ounce in one bag.  That may be possession.  But of its in 8 bags it's intent to sell.  Doesn't actually mean they were intending to sell anything.  The laws are stupid and they always charge you with the max, doesn't mean it would stick.  Will get plead down to simple possession.

If you were at all knowledgeable about this issue you would know the victims defend their masters and will insist they are there "voluntarily"  so their masters don't get into trouble.  They in most cases have been emotionally and physically abused and become completely dependent on them,  they will do anything and say anything to keep them out of harms way.  I wouldnt expect anyone here to understand this nuance because neither you nor anyone you know has been kidnapped isolated from friends and family and been completely physically and mentally broken.

I can't find the specifics,  but I believe the logic was the charges held minimum sentencing guidelines of 30 years. Federal inmates serve 85% percent of their time bringing that to 25 years. It's likely the attorney could have haggled a 25 year deal bringing time served closer to 20. All of which are better than life!

I've thought about it and I've not been able to come up with something that any one could do in a few clicks or taps on a phone screen.

Maybe bitcoin or another decentralized ledger can scale to support the needs of banks *sometime* in the future. Maybe they won't. What we do know, is that right now, bitcoin cannot support the transaction volume banks need to build the new applications they want to build. Therefore they are making their own blockchain solutions.

Media hype? Uh...I don't watch any media that hypes sex trafficking. Whether or not they would or would not have been trafficked isn't the issue. If you are facilitating a crime you are guilty. If I drive you to someone's house and you go inside and rape and murder the occupants and then I drive you away when you are done I'm charged with the same crimes. I am not implying the guy actually did anything as I've not seen any evidence nor have I read the laws he has been charged with breaking. I'm just saying IF they have evidence he knowingly allowed sex traffickers to operate in mass on his site he is fucked legally speaking.

**It’s always easy to make outlandish predictions. My goal for this post was to outline what I think the tailwinds are behind Bitcoin. I don’t know if the price is going to $1000 or $10,000? - ?but I do know that it is going up. If I was forced to predict, I would say that it would hit $1000+ in 2016 and $3000+ in 2017.

I don't like TA in general not your TA specifically.  I don't like it because it relies heavily on hindsight.  I don't like it because it is rarely presented objectively along side a record of previously correct TA predictions.  There doesn't seem to be any accountability for when it fails only credit taken when it succeeds. I just think it lacks objectivity and accountability specifically in the context of predictions over time.  It feels like a broken clock is right twice per day type of thing. If I draw enough lines and manipulate the charts enough times I'll be right sometimes.

It gets downvoted because it ignores the mountains of evidence that support the finding that dpr is ross and he was operating a criminal enterprise from a laptop in the same library he went to every day like an idiot. Corroborated by friends who said he told them about it. Vast multi agency conspiracies like yours are loony tunes. USG is so dysfunctional we cannot stop a crazy terrorist after 3 fbi investigations from shooting a club full of people. Oh and also massively fails the occams razor sniff test.

How much of a Douchebag is this guy? And why the fuck are you all upvoting this. Shameful. Embarassing. Such high horse condescending bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 12:01:57
Its hit or miss.  Very difficult to buy bitcoin instantly.

I mean you could say a car is more useful than house because a car can take you to and from work. But a house isn't designed with the same utility so its kind of.....fucking stupid to make the comparison of utility between two completely different tools. A car is fucking useless in a traffic jam. Useless without gas. Definitely useless in the snow. A gun seems to maintain its utility in just about any situation.

Not the worst character flaw to have.

They operate as a bank plain and simple. This should be well known by now.

Before posting this did you:
1) Verify people can easily pay for day to day expenses in bitcoin
2) Verify that people can easily exchange between bitcoin and lira
3) pull your head out of you ass?

Bitcoin is working as intended.
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:34:54
They do 20 years because they pay a huge fine and accept a plea deal.  Dpr should have taken the plea deal 
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:11:45
I think you severely over estimate any correlation to the real world. Fact is nobody cares about bitcoin outside of this sub and I can't imagine any circumstances in which people magically care. It's difficult to acquire and use and that hasn't changed in years.

No you are correct.  It is still too difficult to buy,  secure and use. Progress is being made,  just slowly.

Ugh... I'm not connecting the dots here.  Sovereign nations with physical borders have failed so we are going to perpetuate the problem by creating more sovereign nations with physical borders.

It was open source. That is how our legal system works. Google federal rules of evidence and chain of custody.

They don't care at all about losing customers. You are literally dealing with another bank here. You should expect the same level of customer service.
