I agree that many of them didn't fully understand, but they seemed to understand enough to know that Andreas knew his stuff and could be trusted.  
They seemed to 'get' Andreas' point that there is a distinction between a centralized group of keys held in trust at a Company vs people handling their own keys, and regs should be considered for the former but not the latter.  
They also seemed to recognize hasty regs would only push innovation to other countries.  
Andreas &gt;&gt;&gt; much diplomacy, how eloquence,  WOW.

I presented a webinar to a group of executives and lawyers last fall and wanted to present both the technical side of Bitcoin as well as give a general overview of Bitcoin (names to know, legal landscape, lawsuits, altcoins) to provide them with both an appreciation of how it works as well as to arm them with enough information so that they could hold a conversation about Bitcoin with others.  I did exactly what you are doing to prepare --- reading &amp; watching videos (I second the Antonopolous video recommendation, he is amazing).  For what it's worth, the culmination of that research was condensed into a 50 minute presentation which is archived here &gt;&gt;&gt; 
Good luck and have fun with it!  People are very receptive and interested, so it's a fun topic to present.
