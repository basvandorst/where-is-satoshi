Thanks so much. 
Generally speaking, these incompatibilities can be resolved with various mnemonic conversion apps, right? It's not like my bitcoins would ever be in jeopardy due to these incompatibilities?

It was more expensive this way, but I hadn't spent bitcoin on a physical object yet, so it was really just to have the experience. 
Also, they say that using BTC sort of supports it and reenforces its legitimacy. If nobody ever spends it then it becomes less supported and that isn't good for it, as I've been told.

Thanks, this has all been so helpful.
Mycelium worked correctly, as you suspected it would, by the way.

Ledgerwallet (the company) says in the packaging for the product that it doesn't even need tamper resistance, because the firmware is effectively nearly impossible to hack. 
Still, cryptocurrencies are notoriously unforgiving for even a single security mistake, so I don't think anyone would blame you for wanting a pristine one straight from the source...

Yes. The ledger wallet basically just stores your private keys, and you plug it in and use an app to view balances and make transactions. You can install various coins and alt coins "apps" to the ledger wallet device so that it will support most popular coins, as well as ones in the future.

This is really good, but my favorite is still the guy explaining all the bitcoin crashes over time.

I ordered mine directly from the factory in France, I paid for the UPS express, and I had it in 48 hours, sealed new and shiny. I paid in BTC, of course. Love it so far.
