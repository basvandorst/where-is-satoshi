Your wallet is more than one address, read up about change addresses, as it is likely that your "missing" BTC is at another address which is part of your wallet. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 21:44:41
The Bitcoin software automatically created those new addresses, a wallet is multiple address, some you see and some you don't see. This should help understand it 
You do own those second addresses, the software uses multiple addresses, not just 1 (I think it creates about 100 when the wallet was first created).

Bitcoin has to spend the whole of the input, it sends the amount you spent (0.01) and then sends the rest of the Bitcoin you received in that input to a change address which is part of your wallet.

There is someone on Twitter who says their support ticket number is  and it hasn't been responded to yet. I am number  and that is now 3 days old. So they are seriously behind.
On 13th April Bitstamp tweeted "there is no delay for deposits if you provide you deposit reference with you transaction." - 
This seems to be a lie as both you and I have transfer not appeared as well as others I can find.

You are correct about Litecoin also going down in the LTC/USD market. 
To be fair though the "good news" isn't fake because Mt Gox is looking into implementing Litecoin this month: they tweeted about it again just 3 hours ago 
Litecoin will go up because of this news with or without Fontas, he/she is just trying to take credit for the likely price rise and then dump their 300,000+ Litecoins on anyone who doesn't cash out if an obvious bubble forms.

Yeah that's the only annoyance I have. They sometimes change the leverage amount from 1:10 to 1:5, but apart from that I would say it is worth having a go with it. I'm not too good at Forex though.

Looks like Bitcoinity has also defaulted to Bitstamp also...

Yep, lesson learned.

I have never given a photo, I'm just a buyer. You can still buy without verifying a photo. Sellers do need to verify though.

bitbargain is good, I've had about 10 successful buys there. The coins are stored if there is a dispute. Familiarise yourself with the process using the video on the main page. You pay a few quid more than the Bitstamp price, but the sellers release the coins within about 3 minutes of you doing a bank transfer. Just make sure you copy the sellers bank transfer details correctly when you pay. Prices seem to go up and down depending on who is online, so it can be worth waiting a while to get each coin a few quid cheaper.

It was Litecoin $2.697 and Bitcoin $97.932 according to

I'm in same position. They changed their bank details last Thursday and are currently not honoring deposits that went to their old account. There are others in same position as being discussed on BitcoinUK subreddit - 
@_date: 2013-10-24 09:11:53
Yeah I've done the same and made money with demo mode. If only I could play in the same carefree attitude in my trading on real play mode, which I think is the problem as I trade far too carefully on real mode.

Nice one, glad it went smooth, welcome to Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-09-03 02:27:05
You could also go to the other end of the spectrum, what if those same 1 million coins you say could be dumped are actually being stored to do good in some way. Not for personal gain but to help humanity when the time is right.

Been watching that all day, earlier someone bought about 4000 Bitcoins worth of Litecoin to get over the 0.035 wall. Litecoin has gone down as Bitcoin does but the BTC/LTC ratio has been increasing all week. Here's a good chart

I think the growth in the addresses holding &gt; 0.1 coins is good. 2.59% growth in just 5 days. I expect any bank would love it if their number of newly opened accounts rose by that percentage.

Surely the thing to do would be to get musicians on board with accepting bitcoin payments by actively promoting bitcoin to musicians. 
I run a website for musicians where where musicians remix tracks in exchange for prizes, it's quite well known among musicians, we have nearly 10k followers on Facebook. This post has given me the idea that I could help promote bitcoin to musicians by offering bitcoin as the prize. It's something I'm going to think about.

This happened to me the other day, QRK gone, no order came up, no BTC received in return, still got a ticket open for it 2 days later with a reply saying it has been sent to technical support, no contact from them since.

£46, bought around 23rd March and taken this long to get the response above. I just don't want to see others lose more than that as there are people spending a lot more than that thinking that Paypal will back them up and that the seller is taking most of the risk.

Companies like buysellads.com. I've already asked them back in April. The reason why they might be amenable to it is because I believe that most of their users are more technologically adware than average plus they could then pay out to publishers in Bitcoin also making Bitcoin more spread out.
The reply I got when I asked: "Thank you for your comments. We appreciate your feedback, and we will be sure to keep this in mind for future updates. :) "

I recently used  to send money to Bitstamp.net using my UK debit card. Everything went well. Sent last Friday, Bitstamp got the money today, should be quicker midweek with no weekend.

I have and fully recommend it, I've bought off about 5 different users on there in 8 transactions and always received the bitcoins about 2 minutes after paying using bank transfer to cash out to my own wallet. You pay a couple of £ more than the gox price, but at the moment it is the easiest way for me to get Bitcoin in small amounts in the UK.

I've joined, it would be good if you put something in the sidebar listing places where people can buy Bitcoin in the UK as I was new to Bitcoin just last week and it took me hours of research to get hold of just a few Bitcoins and finally managed to through Blockchain. It's not as easy as some people like to make out when you have a UK bank account in GBP£.

Sorry I thought you thought the Mt Gox news was fake. You obviously mean the Fontas fanboys spreading disinfo.
Yeah people reading this who are interested in Litecoin should take any news which can't be backed up sources as fake and realise that Litecoin has nearly no economy behind it like Bitcoin has and that there are at least 2 people with hundreds of thousands of Litecoins waiting to cash out. They will probably do this within 24 to 48 hours of Litecoin hitting Gox. Here is the pump and dump scheme which anyone investing in Litecoin at the moment should read:

I had the same happen to me back in March, bought 1 coin for about £50, never received coin, I used Paypal, but Paypal didn't give money back because it was "for digital goods", so Paypal might not have saved you. I even had the seller admit in a eBay message that they didn't send it, didn't make any difference to eBay or Paypal, best to avoid both for Bitcoin.

I've used it, I don't like that the close position button blanks out when it gets all volatile. It stops you from grabbing the best price and you have to let it settle down to be able to click.
