Smart kid. Rare talent for 18 year old. Unlike many who are lazy and feel entitled.

Great job kid!! You’re doing great things. Most kids your age are smoking dope behind Burger King. Keep up the good work. Is there going to be a few to exchange coins?

So make a new circle. Life is way to short to be hanging your head down and thinking of what if's. You can do your research and find some promising coin. Good things will
Come to you

Sometimes you need to be more lucky than skillful. But that’s good he is making money. Most kids his age are constantly spending money and have no idea the value of money.

I assume you're healthy and other things in your life are going okay? If they are, you are rich! I know it's always said, but money does not equal happiness. I work in the healthcare industry and I see countless of young people who would give their life savings to have 6 more months to live. You did a great thing and you changed people's lives. Karma says that good things will come back to you. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but be patient, it will. Happy New Years!

HODL mate! Checking prices every hour, let alone every day, will only lead to panic and anxiety. Think long term. Do you realize that Bitcoin is still up from only a month ago? Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and Blockchain is here to stay. When Apple stock plummeted, people used to say that it was the end of Apple...now Apple has the largest market cap in the world, nearly a trillion dollars. You can obviously do whatever you want,  but my suggestion is to HODL. Use money that you feel you could afford to lose, No one made any significant money without risk.

Have you watched or read any news in the last three months? I would say 90% of them discuss the apocalyptic scenario for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, because they want it to fail. People are so afraid of change. And those banks on Wall Street want Bitcoin to fail, they want anything that challenges their monopoly and dominance to falter and fail.

Well we are officially in the 5000s now! Who’s idea was it to HODL?

The Cheer songs are similar for the Eagles and Bitcoin...except Eagles fly Eagles fly! While fud-sters sing for Bitcoin....die Bitcoin die!

Doesn’t seem like many BTC in total though...not enough to drive the market down like it is
