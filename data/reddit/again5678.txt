To those who have a decent number of coins and do not understand paper wallets or cold storage but are scared of losing your coins:
Watch this and poof you WILL know.

Its a result.

Yes it literally vanishes, the sellers set asking prices and if no one buys it continues lower and lower, no money is exchanged and the value vanishes just as easily as it sprang into existence. Granted it normally has a much more graduated procedural step to it but this does happen at scale.

Will buy more soon as well, goal is to buy what I need then ignore them for a few good years.

New billionaires are being made.

The on paper value can appear and vanish as the market moves, billions can vanish simply because there are no buyers and sellers keep reducing their price to find a buyer.
Also billions can be created simply by people not selling which forces buyers to raise their bids to entice a sale.
    
The last sale price is what determines the current value and in turn people use that to determine their current net worth with that asset.
If everyone decided bitcoin sucked right this second or a massive bug was found or the cryptography was cracked, the value could drop to 0, and 80 billion is value would vanish in the blink of an eye.

Yes but in this examples I gave the last transaction sets its current value, its how we give things a -current- value.
As for your slices that has no bearing on this.

Also we are talking past each other by using price, value and worth and not defining those terms.
My contention is your value (the current price) of bitcoin can rise dramatically without the need for actual cash infusion but simply due to a lack of sellers selling at a lower price. 
Did 14 billion dollars in cash flow into Bitcoin today? Nope, some did but the majority if the rise in the market cap and the resulting current price was simply due to a lack of people selling (they valued their bitcoins higher and were continuously proven right by the market today).

Been buying and buying for the last 2 months, never sold and do not plan to for a few years.

This is a fundamental concept you are missing and not able to grasp. Its important to learn.
Lets step back down to apples.
1 apple exists in the universe.
It is never eaten just used as a store of value.
The last time it was purchased was at $1.
I have something worth $1 on the market and now I like my apple and will not sell.
Bidders keep upping their bid and I refuse, the current market price is now set at the current bid, which is now at $250. I now have something worth $250 yet no money was exchanged.

It does not take new invested fiat to raise the price of bitcoins (or any asset for that matter).
