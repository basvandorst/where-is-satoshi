You are wrong. None of the blockchain data is encrypted, it just uses encryption techniques to generate hashes and signatures for mining and verifying transactions. And you don’t get to store custom data, it just stores a value associated with your wallet.
Ethereum contracts have the potential to facilitate what you’re talking about but bitcoin does not.

By the way, I totally agree that its function does give it intrinsic value. I just wanted to be clear that it's value is not being "ecrypted cloud storage." I think ultimately the value of this technology will be eliminating the cost of storing and transferring every asset that can possibly be digitized. It connects individuals directly to vendors and investment opportunities instead of forcing them to go through existing financial institutions that charge you for the privilege. It can also be changed to empower different applications so you can easily build money that works better for your needs or industry (such as privacy coins like Verge or feeless coins like IOTA and RaiBlocks).

Check out [a random block in blockchain explorer]( All transactions are completely public, that's kinda the point. They just can't be fabricated, duplicated, no double spending, etc.
To be clear, cryptography and encryption methods are the key to making the blockchain work. This does not mean the data recorded on the blockchain itself is encrypted. With encrypted data you use the private key to read it, with bitcoin you use your private key to sign a send transaction from your wallet. Everyone can see your wallet, but you're the only one with the keys to move its funds. Encryption doesn't hide your data in this case, it just makes the keys to it work.
The cases of mortage transactions you heard of are likely using smart contracts on ethereum or some other fork of bitcoin. And they don't need to be encrypted, they should actually be publicly visible so everyone can see the mortgage transfer happened. Think of the blockchain as a giant public ledger of who owns what. The point isn't for the ledger to be encrypted and unreadable, its for it to be unforgeable so nobody can lie about what they own or spend what isn't their's. And it does this without needing a central authority, which is what makes it special.
