blockchain.info will give a priority level.  That fee size might take 24 hours.

I have to.

I don't know who refers to Bitcoin as securities.  Have you read the Texas legislation on the coin vending machines? There's a link to it in my document. At The federal level, although not required, I have registered as a MSB with the FinCEN. 
Or maybe you are referring to the Counterparty asset you receive if you help fund the project?  I don't think it's a security because you do not get any voting rights, or equity with it. 
As far as volumes are concerned, the data I list is the only data I could find on the Internet. What is your gross monthly volume on average?

Start/restore leaves me with a black screen as well.  I have to close/reopen.

Update: Arrived, configured, trying to figure out best physical security setup.

Thank you for the comments-and sorry for the delay.

I was going to say 2%, but I revised my thinking. You should put in as much as you are willing to lose.  For most people, that would be 2%.

Thanks!  I've got the hourly log turned on, so that's helping.

Update: I've raised $3,100, ordered the machine, and received the certificate of insurance for the retail store where this will be located.
Now I'm just (excitedly) waiting for the machine to arrive so I can set it up!

Update: installed a week ago, running fine, average daily volume first week: $51.42.

Can you PM me?

If you click on the $6500, you'll see the full budget. It includes operations for one year.  I myself am putting in the $2000 required for cash logistics.  The thing to remember on this, though, is that I do not see this as a moneymaking venture. It's a way to be involved...

For those of you keeping track, the FIRST Bitcoin ATM in Indiana was pulled and apparently re-installed in Ohio.  At least now we have one again...

They don't have a fee, but the retailer does.  I paid $3.  It would be $3 no matter how much I bought...max of $300.  Which means a fee between 1%-6% (since the minimum is $50).
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:29:05
feedback: your ad on localbitcoins doesn't mention there is a fee (minimum of 1%).  I think it implies there isn't a fee.

Oddly, that was his only question. Having installed it, I now have an additional security concern: one aspect of security is based on continued power to the device plus physical security inherent in the metal case.  Could a battery somehow bypass the continued power security?

It occurred to me, as I reviewed these slides, that I should encourage others to "sneak in" bitcoin to their industry presentations.
It can fit almost anywhere (bit of a fanboy here)!  Think: "How will bitcoin affect my area," and lay it out for them.

It's more like going to every storage unit you have, hauling out all of your old couches, and then tearing them apart.

Try Localbitcoins.com. Expensive, but effective. 
If you're in Indy, I'll buy them at spot as a favor. :-)

Minor mention of bitcoins...
@_date: 2012-04-21 18:13:59
Positive article.

How do I know if I'm running a full node?
@_date: 2015-10-10 03:35:43
Those are ones...

It's going great, from my perspective.
It's in a retail store, brings in a customer every other day.  I would like to pay a fixed fee to the retailer, so it would be independent of the xaction, fees, and profits (which are: $0, 14% over coinbase, and zero so far, but going up!  ;-))

Someone has bought one dollars' worth of Bitcoin from my ATM every day for the past five days.
All they need is a QR code of their wallet address.
