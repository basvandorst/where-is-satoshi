Well yes, if you hope to capture rare events then rare events need to be included in your stochastic model.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:51:11
Which is actually a fairly good assumption for the day to day price fluctuations.  
The problem is that rare event sampling is needed to predict "spike" events and as it's name suggests, it's hard to get a good statistical average on those events when it comes to economics.

Over a large enough sample even black swan events can be sampled to a good degree of accuracy. The problem is that they don't occur often enough when it comes to markets.

Well if they are initially talking about the oceans, even if they exclude it in the second figure, I can already assume they made the critical mistake everyone makes.  That is there's a difference the amount of gold that exists and the amount of gold that can be reasonably mined.
It's not just a question of how much exists, but how much we can reasonably extract.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:55:37
I'm not sure it's entirely due to that especially when only ~33% of new gold is used for jewelry. 
Platinum has roughly the same natural abundance as gold and actually depending on which source you use, more abundant.  The only difference is Platinum is harder to isolate because of it's higher melting point. 
The two metals historically have actually flipped back and forth between being the more expensive metal. There have been periods where Plat &gt; Gold and vice versa.  This was the case in the 90s actually.

You wouldn't be the first human in history to fall prey to the logic that just because something hasn't been cracked yet means it will never be cracked.

@_date: 2019-07-08 17:22:48
Yup that's why it's a volatile asset.  It has huge price swings.  Which volatility is good for making a profit since if an asset doesn't move you don't gain much, but it sucks for trying to preserve value.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:00:07
It's because those are cheap and common materials.  People do buy Silver, Platinum, and Palladium on the other hand.  I can go buy some Platinum rounds at my local coin shop.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:13:33
Gold has a relatively low volatility.  Which is good for selling it at roughly the same value you bought it at.
It sucks though for making a profit. You usually have to wait the better part of the decade for prices to change significantly.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:27:37
Irrelevant to the point being made. The point is something can drop to effectively zero in price.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:19:25
Jewelry is part of it, but even industrially there's less of a demand on Platinum because the average industrial uses actually don't require a ton of Platinum.  It's usually used as a catalyst which means you get to reuse the same block of Platinum a lot.  
The only people who really burn through Platinum are glass companies since they have giant containers made out of Platinum for their high temperature processes.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:21:15
That's under the assumption the current trend will continue.  The problem is that Bitcoin is still a highly volatile asset.  We did quite literally have a crash 2 years ago that made it so your Bitcoin was worth anywhere from 1/2 to 1/6 of the spot price depending on when you bought it.  It took 2 years for it to finally rise back up so that if you bought at 10k or more you could simply break even. 
Good stores of value are typically things you can generally cash out for roughly the same amount you bought it for.  IE being able to liquidate your money if you need to. No market is crash proof, but good "safe havens" will still retain a good fraction of their value even during a crash  or will typically crash "slowly" enough that you can pull money oout of it.

@_date: 2019-07-11 22:16:32
It's hard to do a direct one to one comparison in the price because of differences between the units of measurement (IE 1 Bitcoin vs 1 oz of gold).   For reference a single gold coin is over $1k so if you want say a 350oz gold bar for industrial purposes that's going to cost you much closer to $350k.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:00:31
Nope if you make it to 60 your expected life is a extra 26 years.  Average is 86. That's why I said you are doing life expectancy wrong, because you are making the same mistake everyone makes in interpreting it.
The total average is around 78.0, but that includes people who died young due to stupidity, terminal illness, infant mortality, etc. When you look at the conditional average (IE the average given that you've already reached a give age) that number drastically increases.
You don't look at total, you look at conditional when dealing with life expectancy.

The difference between "why" and "because" wasn't significant enough to warant an entire correct.  Both are grammatical and hardly change the meaning in this context. 


If this was the first time on I've been downvoted I might believe you.  It isn't so I hardly buy that.  Even perfectly polite posts that aren't towing the bitcoin party line get downvoted to hell and back here.  I've seen it and been targeted by it too many times to believe this is only because of my tone.  I was already at -1 before I posted my first response. 
In fact this is backwards.  My tone is this way because this subreddit is fucking hostile to "non-believers"

Ah so I'm normal for this subreddit, got it.
The first post in this chain was me making a basic comment.  It was followed by someone trying to make a pointless correction and other people trying to troll. 
I come off as one because the people around here have a habit of downvoting and flame warring with anyone who even voices the smallest bit of skepticism or even tries to explain why something is wrong. It's basically you either say Bitcoin is going to cause a revolution and tear down the Illuminati or you are a heretic.
Hell I tried to explain to someone what "volatility" means and they proceeded to be an insulting dumbass.  I'm well past the point of playing nice on this subreddit because it has an unusually high amount of complete dumbasses who are textbook cases of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Not everyone here is one, but there's an insane number of them.  And usually if they have some sort of Bitcoin themed user name, they're most likely to be the idiots who do it the most.

It would take 265 years on the current super computers.  The problem here is that technology changes.  What was uncrackable 30 years ago is trivial today.
No matter how great your algorithm is, it's not possible to tell what future technology or algorithms will exist.  And your great algorithm could be trivial for that new technology.  
There's a reason encryption and security is a fast moving field.  Because as soon as you figure out a new great security measure, there's someone equally smart trying to tear it down.

Yup. This is the thing that annoys me about a lot of the "free for all" Bitcoin fanatics. I'm generally someone who wants less government regulation in markets. But even I realize that companies such as Paypal, Banks, etc. didn't just spring up out of nowhere.  They were created to address very real problems with economic transactions.

Not just that, if you have to use a 40 year period to make your case that's actually evidence of lower volatility. Volatility is related to how fast the price changes.  
Volatility doesn't mean the price dropped or rose at some period of time. It means the price is rapidly shooting up and down and up and down and up and down.  It's related more to how fast it's changing, not the fact it changed.  Nearly all assets change in price, but not all assets change as fast or by as much. 
The reason Bitcoin is volatile is because it can swing by 10% in a week and drop to 1/3 of it's price in a year.  
Gold is a pretty boring asset in terms of prices because it tends to change slowly unless there's a panic.  It's why it's not the most useful for making a profit.

No it has exactly to do with your point.  High volatility is usually bad for a "store of value" because it means the price is wildly unpredictable.  It's why no one who knows anything about investing puts their saving in single stocks and instead puts it in assets which climb gradually or remain roughly constant. 
You aren't storing value if your Bitcoin can potentially be worth half of what it is today in a year's time.
@_date: 2019-10-13 03:52:37
Yes and most of those have fluctuations of maybe 20% over a 5 year period.  Bitcoin has a 20% fluctuation in a period of months and has seen value drops to 50% or less in the span of a year.
The issue isn't that it fluctuates. It's that it violently fluctuates in the span of a year.
@_date: 2019-10-13 03:57:26

Just because you haven't spent it yet does not mean you don't intend on spending it for such a purposes.  Which was the point dumbass.  You don't invest money you are holding for your monthly expenses if you have a brain nor do you invest nothing. Investing implies you are using it to buy stocks, bonds, bitcoin, retirement, etc.  which usually turns the money il-liquid and thus not suitable for immediate expenses.  No one who knows shit about finance would tell you to invest 100% of your paycheck.  That would be idiotic. 
And no shit that's how banking works.  That's irrelevant to how people use their checking accounts or what's wise to do with investments. 


Award winning actually.  Sorry you're aren't as smart as you think you are since you couldn't figure out I was telling you that no one who has a brain invests 100% of their income.  A lot of it sits in a bank account for a few weeks till you need it.

The point was to show you that you were talking nonsense when you said an investment like that didn't exist.  I gave you an example of a low risk money market mutual fund. There's higher risk ones which tend to grow at a much higher annual rate.
You don't know anything about mutual funds. This is very clear by now.
And sorry Bitcoin went up a massive amount because it was worth nothing when it started. Just like how stock in new technology usually shoots up like a rocket and if you get in on yhe ground floor you can make bank. However assuming exponential growth will continue is a fools investment strategy.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:33:16
The problem here is that there's no guarantee that it will jump by 10000% again.  Demand and growth isn't infinite.  Comparing an asset which has matured to an asset which initially was worth nothing will always show huge jumps if you give it in terms of percent difference. The question is what will it do as it levels off.

.........what?  This is makes zero sense.
The point is if we are talking about a store of value then Bitcoin could very easily tank in value as it does on a regular basis.  It hasn't proven to be stable just yet.


Yes and Bitcoin crashed down to 1/6 of it's value if you are going to take peak to trough. 
In the last decade gold rose from $377/oz in 2001 to $2000/oz in 2011 before crashing down to $1300/oz where it has been stable for 6 years straight. IE if you sold gold today that you bought 6 years ago it would be worth nearly the same amount you bought it for.
The differences with Bitcoin is all those rises and drops and crashes happened within a 2 year period where as the crashes you are talking about took nearly 10 years to happen. 
Volatility is defined by not if the price changes up and down.  It's dependent on how much it changes and how often it changes. So no to say Gold is "volatile" like Bitcoin is ignorant.  Bitcoin fluctuates a lot more wildly.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:05:02


What that means is that gold's market price isn't going to suddenly drop to zero because it's still heavily traded due to the industrial sector.  IE if you buy gold there's a high chance people are still going to be willing to buy it again in 10 years.  I personally don't buy much precious metals because there's better ways to invest, but there's at least an argument for gold as a store of value. 
Bitcoin has the same problem that the US dollar does.  It's only valuable so long as it's being used as currency.  The minute no one wants to use it as currency it has zero utility at that point. 


There's a lot of things that you can use as money. Cheap cigarettes were used as currency in WW2 POW camps. That doesn't mean they are good stores of value.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:51:19
Yes it could very well do that.  It could also have a case where percentage of the world's population crypto could go to 0.1% or it could never go past 2%. 
There's a lot it could do.  The problem is we won't know for sure.

LOL! This is why I love What detailed examples? You gave me cherry picked data over a 50 year period with zero clue as to what volatility means, I gave you official market statistics used to gauge volatility. Aka my data &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your data if you actually knew anything about this subject.

@_date: 2019-06-17 14:17:26

Except some of those things tend to hold value because people need them or find them useful.
Houses tend to hold value because people need places to live. Gold tends to hold value because it has uses outside of monetary use.
The reason currencies have that problem more than other materials is that minute no one uses/trusts them they have zero use outside of maybe toilet paper.
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:05:55


Ummm why would I ask them?  Last I checked it's the devaluation of their currency that's a problem. 
Which actually the main problem isn't just the currency, it's the complete lack of supplies at the moment. 


People jump ship to other currencies all the time.  Both fiat and other types of currency. In the USSR when the government printed currency sucked they started using Coffins and Vodka.  People move to whatever currency gets the job done. 
A currency is only as good as the public's trust in it.  


And this is different from Bitcoin how?  I have to pay money to move or buy Bitcoin currently. 


It would if that coin were no longer a shit coin or if Bitcoin became a shit coin due to a major problem. In the same way that Blackberry phones immediately fell off the map when the iPhone came out. 
The only reason Bitcoin currently remains king is that it's the oldest and most well known. Things can change very quickly in an open market place.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:25:17
What properties?  It's an item that has no external uses besides use as a currency and it's value is entirely speculative. I'm not a fan of gold, but at least that has actually physical uses not tied to money.  For example gold is used in electronics, as industrial catalyst, in jewelry, etc. 
Bitcoin could be dead tomorrow if a system breaking exploit was found in the code. Again it's a highly volatile asset.  It's not a good store of value till that changes. 
I own bitcoin, but I'm under no delusion that it's "storing my value" anytime soon.  I'm treating it exactly as it should be treated, as a high risk investment.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:40:53

Again YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.  Stop! You do not have a clue of what you are talking about.

Great store of value wasn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:00:50
Yes because the asset initially was worthless.  Same as if you bought stock in a new company and that company took off.  What you don't seem to get is that we aren't just talking about 20% dips.  We are talking about the asset losing 2/3 of it's value....twice!  Dropping from $18k to $3k isn't just normal market fluctuations. 
And no, my worries isn't that you might be in the red.  It's that there's a high volatility with bitcoin just like there is with stock trading.  Ignoring that volatility is how you lose money.  If you bought in at $9k or more the last few years you've been waiting to just break even for 2 years now.  
There's a reason no one puts their retirement savings in single stock investments.  Because there's a reasonably high chance it could crash and take your savings with it.  
There's no way in hell I'm putting money I can't afford to lose in Bitcoin. Which is pretty much the definition of something that IS NOT a store of value.
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:29:41


You mean besides investments like low risk mutual funds?
Sure no investment is 100% safe. Sure if you want a high yield you usually have to take on more risk, but there are tons of investments that have steady growth. Which is why investment professionals usually diversify into both low risk and high risk investments.

Right and currently that remains a big "if".  Thus any money spent on Bitcoin is taking the risk that it will pan out.  In the same way that buying stock in a company is a risk that the company will pan out.
Bitcoin is currently more equivalent to stocks than it is anything else. Which is why I would never tell someone to invest in it if they didn't have the money to lose. 


Neither are bits on a computer. Which while one block chain has a finite value, there's no reason someone can't create more block chains as we've seen with the dozens upon dozens of Bitcoin offshoots.  Even if the world moves toward block chain, there's no guarantee it will be the original Bitcoin block chain.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:15:49
Yes it does when we are talking about percent difference.
Prices going up over a period doesn't make something a store of value. Otherwise stocks would be a store of value.
A store of value is something you have a good chance of cashing out at the same buying power as when you bought in.

If calling you out on your bullshit understanding of market terminology is trolling, I'm a troll then.
But I hate to inform you, you don't understand it either.  


Yes moron, if you have to go to a 50 year period to find changes that means it isn't volatile.   By definition.  Volatility is a measure of how quickly something changes. 
A low volatility asset doesn't imply it never goes down, it implies it won't change much in a short period of time. 
Volatility is related to the market fluctuations. 




Dips != volatility.  Try again.  I'm amazed how many people on here don't know what the fuck volatility means. 
Plus what's funny. Since 2001 Gold prices have risen consistently.  The 2011 crash was after it had went up to 6 times it's value over a decade.  Which it only crashed back down to 4x it's original value after 2001.   It has held nearly constant for 6 years.  As opposed to Bitcoin which in 2 years alone when from short of $20k to $10k to $6k to $3k to $6k to $10k.  In the same time gold has remained steady around $1200/oz. 
Try again, you are just as bad as he is at this.  You also have the wrong idea that prices going down = volatility.

Except the whole point of a 401K is that it isn't taxed until you pull the money out. 
In the case of a Roth IRA it is taxed going into it, but the gains are completely tax free.
That's why there's restrictions on it because you are getting a tax discount for using it.
Plus you are doing life expectancy wrong.

LOL! Yes if you have to zoom out to 50 years to find large fluctuations that implies a lower volatility! That's the point. If the asset only changes value by +/- 10-20% in a 5-10 year window then it's by definition low volatility!  
Volatility means large rapid swings in either direction.  All investable assets go up and down over time, but volatility means it goes up and down FAST.  Single stocks are volatile assets because they can wildly swing in price in a single day. 
In fact. We have measurements to estimate volatility related to the standard deviation!
When you look at Gold's VIX it's around 10-24 for the last decade compared to Bitcoin who has had a VIX of 36-50 in the last two years. (Larger implies higher volatility)  For reference the S&amp;P 500 hovers around 10-20 on average with peaks of 30. 
In other words Gold is half as volatile as according to VIX than Bitcoin. It has had periods of volatility, but it's only been for short windows at a time. 
Again you've only proven you don't understand what an asset being volatile is.  You actually proven gold ISN'T volatile!  An asset occasionally crashing IS NOT VOLATILITY!
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:35:25
The net effect is the same. It doesn't matter how, what matters is the currency you hold is losing value.
Which the same is true for regular currency. If people start jumping ship to another currency on the planet, your currency loses value.
Again the problem here is really no different. Bitcoin only has value if it is being used as currency or being propped up by speculation. The minute it no longer has that use, it becomes worthless.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:26:25


Keep proving you don't understand what volatility means and why absolutely no one should listen to you about anything related to investments. 


Sorry the one year VIX for gold in pretty much all of 2015 was below 20. Which means it was even less volatile than the S&amp;P 500 usually is. For someone calling my a thick skulled idiot, you don't know how to even research volatility.
Gold only lost $200/oz from $1300/oz to $1100/oz.  A 15% difference dumbass.  That's not volatile.  Bitcoin loses that much in a day. 
Sorry buddy, you don't know anything about this subject and should really just shut up.

Um yeah that makes it valuable because that means even when it's not used as money it has a non-zero demand.  
Just like how Platinum, Iridium, and Palladium have prices that can be on par or higher than gold because they are rare metals that are super useful.  Even though those metals aren't used as often for "fancy" purposes. 
And gold is useful in more areas than just electrical. Electrical work is just the most well known.

No if you look long term it went to ~1/6th of it's value in a year's time, doubled the next year, and then has been all over the place. That's the very definition of high volatility and high volatility = high risk since it's prices are hard to predict. 
Stable investments are ones where they might fluctuate by +/- 10% over a year period while steadily climbing with inflation.  IE investments where there's a good chance they will be worth the same amount or more as when you cash them out as when you bought into them.  Not change by a -600% difference. 
Single stock investments do the later, which is why you don't buy single stocks unless you are willing to take on that risk.
This isn't me saying you shouldn't buy Bitcoin, but the idea this is a store of value is completely ludicrous.  This is a high risk investment.  It may pay off, but there's also a real chance it could crash to a fraction of it's current value and never come back.
I just want people to be realistic with this.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:34:05

Yes I am aware, but the false assumption is that the process is happening uniformly across the universe. You can have an infinite universe which contains a finite amount of material.  We already know of ways an object can be infinite in length yet holds a finite amount of volume.  Go look up Gabriel's horn as an example.

By narrow you mean a viewpoint taken by people who actually have wealth and aren't broke?
Yes volatility means you can lose everything you own if the Bitcoin market takes a bad turn.  Therefore it is BAD for safe guarding your savings since it can't even guarantee that you will have the same amount of money in a year's time let alone a 5-10 year window. Bitcoin in a single year has changed in value by a massive amount. If you bought Bitcoin in May of last year you just lost half your money. 
No investment is without risk, but the risk of each investment is not equal. Bitcoin has the same level of risk as buying single stocks.  You are at the mercy of the market which can drop like a rock in one day. 
Most people who are good at investing are people who are good at managing risk.  People who lose all their money on the market are people who suck at managing risk. Until Bitcoin levels out, sorry buddy the risk is pretty high. 


Great, but that doesn't change the risk factor with Bitcoin.  If you bought it even 6 months ago you just lost half your income.


Yes they do because even if Bitcoin were to take over the exact same rules apply to Bitcoin.  Changing the currency does not change basic economics. 
High risk investments are not good for protecting against economic downturns.  In fact that's the opposite of what you want to put your money in.

Silver would survive a lot of that, but the flip side is why would you expect your wallet to survive a lot of that? What if someone steals your cold storage? What if your non-cold storage exchange goes down and you lose all your coins?
We've already seen the stories about people losing access to their wallets. 


Sell the silver? Take it with you?  Unless we are talking about giant bars of it it's pretty easy to do. 


Only if Crypto retains it's value. Which at the moment is no guarantee. Silver on the other hand tends to retain value if for no other reason than it has industrial uses which means there's usually a non-zero demand for it.  Crypto on the other hand could quite literally drop down
Crypto is an interesting experiement, but come on it's still not a stable currency at the moment.  It's high risk to stay in Crypto.

The amount of gold in seawater is on the order of one part per billion to one part per trillion. It's doubtful you could do that cheaply because the energy cost alone is massive.  At least not unless the current supply of gold is exhausted. 
You would need excessively cheap energy first.
Gold in general does not dissolve well in a lot of mediums so the amount floating around is going to be minimal.  In fact that's exactly a reason why gold was used for money in the first place.  Because it doesn't readily react.

Completely false.  I can tell you have never played anything at a high level if you are making dumb statements such as this.

Yup. A common mistake people make when examining inflation is usually that common economic measures of inflation are based on comparing similar items at different points in time (say a loaf of bread).  It however it often fails to take into account the improving quality of goods,  the introduction of new products that were not around back at a given time, or the increase in accessibility of items that were previously were only available to the rich.  
To give an example, the average person today has access to computers that are way better than the computers only the rich could afford in the 1960s-1980s.   Oranges and many other food items used to be so expensive that only the rich could afford them, now any joe with a few bucks can walk into a grocery store and walk out with some. 
You have to understand what each inflation metric tells you about the standard of living today vs previous years.  The problem is most people don't bother learning what each metric tells you and then proceed to make wild claims about things.

Sure in the short term that is true, but in the long term many institutions rise up as trustworthy and become the go to.
I mean if you were to buy a new phone would you rather buy a Samsung, Apple, Google, or some random unknown company in China? You'll probably avoid the random Chinese company unless it's started to gain a good reputation.  The reason you may go with one of the other three companies is because you know they generally produce working phones that are used by millions of people.

I would personally liquidate anything that's reasonable (Don't cash out 401ks or anything you'll get penalized for and you don't need to sell your car unless it's too expensive for your income) and pay off any debt before I put a dime into investments.  Debt is an outstanding liability to have hanging around.  A lot of financial managers tell you to get rid of it before going hardcore into investing for a reason.   
If things go horribly wrong that debt is a lead weight around your neck.  It's usually what kills people financially when markets goes under.  When the housing market crashed the poeple who got screwed the most were the ones who were playing the debt game of "so long as I flip houses fast enough to out pace the interest payments/when I have to make principal payments, I make a profit".  Except when the market crashed they got stuck with all these houses they had to make payments on they discovered why this was a trash idea.  Most of the bankruptcies around this time were from house flippers. It's also what killed companies such as Toy's R Us was that they were so busy servicing their debt that they couldn't keep up with competition from Amazon.

I don't agree.  Just because something is low interest doesn't mean it can't become a huge problem if for instance the market crashes, you lose your job, etc. 
You need to always account for the "within reason" worst case scenario.  Losing your job or having a disruption income is not an uncommon scenario for example.  Another scenario is if you get injured and can't work for some reason. 
If you have something like debt that you'll be paying off in 10 months or less, sure you might be able to justify buying some bitcoin.   But even then you should probably just pay off the debt first. 
You should be eliminating as much debt as possible before making any major investments. Because debt is always a liability.  It works great when there is smooth sailing, but when things go bad is when you realize just how stupid it is to keep debt hanging around. I've seen too many people get absolutely screwed by this in my life.   It's why I hammered my debt as soon as I got out of college and paid off everything I could.  It frees up a lot of income to invest however I desire.

Exactly.  Bitcoin on the other hand you can't say that about because there's potentially infinitely many competitors even in it's own realm.  That's part of stability is that you can't be upset by a new upstart.  Gold has been stable because there's not many physical materials that has the same properties. 


Strange then why do people where I work use gold to catalyze chemical reactions? They make nanorods out of gold and do all sorts of interesting physics with it. I thought it just sat there and did nothing?

And no, those situations I am talking about don't relate to gold.  Bitcoin could tank simply because some other alt-coin gains enough traction to take it down.  That's a scenario that hasn't happened in thousands of years with gold and that's because the properties of gold are hard to replicate with any other physical material. 
In addition you can't use Bitcoin in chemistry.  You can't use it in electronics.  You can't use it to make jewelry.  You can't use it as a catalyst.  Those things alone give a metal value.

Wrong. Painfully wrong in fact. It completely does.
There's a reason Platinum is expensive as hell even though it wasn't as commonly used as money and has a higher natural abundance than gold.  That's because it's uses as industrial catalyst and for it's uses as a metal with a high melting point makes it incredibly valuable. 
Gold's alternative uses will mean that there is always a non-zero demand for it.  That's precisely what demand is, a weighing of what alternative uses a material could have.  Bitcoin's alternative uses outside of money is pretty much nothing right now. 


Because knock offs have never ever become higher quality than the original and eventually taken down the original....oh wait...that's exactly what happened with German cameras.  Japanese companies in the 1930s were making cheap knock offs, but over time they improved and became companies such Canon and Nikon.   Both of which are major companies today. 
Montgomery Ward used to be one of the biggest retailers in the nation.  They are pretty much gone now.  Why?  Because the minute someone can do something better and you lose your market base you're are worth nothing.
There's absolutely nothing that prevents that from happening with Bitcoin.  Anyone can fork the repo and if someone makes a major improvement over the original Bitcoin it can cause a complete collapse.
What are knock offs now could easily become dominant coins in the future and there's no telling what kind of new technology could come out in 5 years time that could replace Bitcoin.  


Sure tell me 4 things bitcoin can do better than gold other than decentralization,  divisibility,  transferability, and limited supply.  I'll wait.
Oh wait, turns out if you arbitrarily take away important factors you can make anything seem worthless. Try again. 
Sorry those lab experiments are valuable regardless of gold's status as money.  Bitcoin on the other hand is only valuable if it is used as money.  Otherwise it's just bits on a computer unable to even perform useful computations.
