IMO: Bitcoin has severe fundamental technical problems that limit its use as either a currency or a store of value, so there's inherent downward pressure on price as the flaws become more pronounced and the supply of new enthusiastic "investors" dries up. At its heart Bitcoin is a zero-trust distributed database and you're paying to own a small piece of the data. The problem is aspects of BTC's blockchain implementation details along with the required proof of work (POW) mining inevitably lead to an insane resource use "arms race" (mining farms).
Bitcoin must now cost some ungodly amount of money in mining equipment, datacenter space, electricity and IT ops to keep running, many millions of dollars per day (e.g. apparently TSMC alone did up to $400 million in crypto sales last quarter). That money must come from somewhere, and eventually it's the pockets of the people investing and trading Bitcoin/POW cryptos. The miner's incentives are badly misaligned with those using it as a currency/investment, and unless some new set of technologies (SegWit/LN) can drastically bring down the effective cost of operating the network, it will almost certainly keep bleeding investment and ultimately collapse entirely or come under the direct control of a single entity at a drastically lower price point.
Blockchain itself is a very cool and probably revolutionary technology, but it's far more likely the blockchains normal humans use in their everyday life say 5 years from now will look more like [Grin]( than BTC, because on its face there's few advantages and many disadvantages to a distributed database implementation doubling as a speculative bubble, electricity use on par with Belgium and enough server power to run the Visa and Mastercard backend 5x over with 1/10000th the transaction volume.
Given there's no underlying asset beyond the distributed database, Bitcoin's inefficiency will doom it.
