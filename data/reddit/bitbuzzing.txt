Btw Hi Jeremiah.

The best moment for me was the price rally in November and December. Not because of the rising but because everyone seemed to be happier and shared more stories. This place was more fun, new people came and the interest in bitcoin went through the roof.

@_date: 2015-08-16 17:37:49
haha no problem 
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:36:56
First of all congrats! I like the nice and clean design maybe make a little gap between the reviews and see more reviews and maybe the partners in a new lign parallel. These are just my thoughts :) But keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:21:24
didn´t receiive any but thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:07:02
let it gooo let it gooo
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:55:08
ok thanks for your reply! 
@_date: 2015-08-14 08:17:42
I don´t have a problem with it, I am just curios if it is manipulated and why should it be.. Illumati confirmed of course
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:43:04
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:00:01
everyone with some extra money could profit with the bitcoin price going up and down - sometimes even just from switching from one to another exchange.. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:10:57
Bitcoin is getting more stable in my opinion only after 1/2 years of being "mainstream".
Your second point is what concerns me, how much are the big players already involved and how easy would it be for them to manipulate/destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:02:00
So the bitcoin qt is the full node? Which I would need if I mine btc.. Not a full node are electrum and stuff? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:53:50
mark this nsfw
@_date: 2015-08-15 07:01:16
aren´t we all because of that? But for the bitcoin price i´m just curious, because it is pretty low at the moment
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:06:26
dafaq o.O but not bad!
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:39:00
yeah thats f****ed up.. but i want to get to know bitcoin better, maybe go and take a coffee together and stuff
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:35:13
i knew it! and everybody told me they are dead 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:38:05
But as you´re saying: Two entities - why is it the same coin then? Isn´t it another cryptocurrency or is that a different thing?
Do WE (The user) have to download the bitcoin xt if we support the bigger blocks? Do bigger blocks mean less transaction costs?
Okay I get the data thing - is this making bitcoin faster or not?
- Sorry, so many questions
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:22:15
good to know. thanks cryptowho

thanks for your answer
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:06:09
Hey I really like and appreciate what you´re doing! Thanks for being generous. But don´t you think it would be better to spend them to non-bitcoiner? Give them 10 dollar in Bitcoin or so would generate more new bitcoiners :)
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:45:50
Nope i won´t download this
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:12:11
Is this right? "Ok there is your way to fix this, also there are many reports from this week about Bitcoin-Core crash's.. they did something wrong on the new version..
sometimes Bitcoin-Core have problems with the wallet.dat, or bootstrap.dat files and its lead to crash the Wallet-Client..
you should do those steps:
Click on Start -&gt; Run -&gt; Type here " C:\Program Files\Bitcoin " or the drive you installed it.
when you there, you should check if there file called " bitcoind " on daemon folder, if the file exist you should patch your Bitcoind file to fix the problem
by this patch here:
 link removed]/Bitcoin-Core
Just click on patch file " Replace bitcoind.exe " , and your done.. "

No it isn´t. this wallet was a new one.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:28:15
Thank you! (Did not understand how and why though :D ) Now I get it
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:31:42
i like the flat design and also the icons a lot. I think it´s the right step
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:24:31
my reason to keep (one) address is that i receive a some bits from time to time. HD changes the address after each transaction right?
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:43:49
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:32:10
So what´s next now? The EuGH decides now?

"the sweep function will send all coins related to the imported private key(s) to a new address (from the deterministic wallet). After sweeping, the private key is no longer capable of spending coins." [Source]( 
After sweeping i cannot spend any more coins from that private key but i still receive coins?
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:48:31
Wow that´s a pretty good and easy example. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:50:12
people can give you their emtpy bottles and stuff and for every 10 bottles you provide a meal for the homeless or so. (don´t know how to integrate bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:21:24
I don´t know if it is possible to import private keys. Wouldn´t even know how to do that, i only know about the wallet.dat :D 
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:41:10
Okay I think I get it. I just need to type "dumpprivkey MYBITCOINADDRESSIWANTTOKEEP" and then what? (Sorry I am not that technical) My wallet is encrypted - do I have to do something extra? Is the Backup of that private key encrypted or not?
THANK YOU!
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:27:14
last question: Is it "dangerous" to export (and import) the private key, like could it stop working? I will print the private key out and then import it to another new wallet, so I am pretty save. Thank you for your answers and time! I know that´s not much and "just dogecoin" but I don´t have changetip and you deserve a tip :) +300 doge 
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:14:43
this censorship and banning wouldn´t be if people did not behaved like 10 years old... It´s okay to have more opinions, make a pro and contra list together, discuss objective - easy as that

Why are Bitcoins safe? The private key is the key to the bitcoin - can´t we just guess/create all the private keys and import them to our wallet? 
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:26:37
But the difference between these things and bitcoin is: Bitcoin is a currency - we do understand how cash works and we do understand how a money transaction works without even having to wonder about a bigger blocksize or such things. People are much more careful with their money.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:14:00
Not really, but credit card companies guarantee you safety and even replace stolen money - Bitcoin won´t. There is no third party for the first time for people, maybe that´s why many think of bitcoin as a scam.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:52:31
So it seems that I have to learn a little bit more about private keys. Thanks for your effort and long answers! send a doughnut! 
@_date: 2015-09-06 12:16:42
what do you have to do in those courses? Is it a specific time per week or just when you can? Thanks
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:01:20
Yeah at least this problem is there before mass adoption, and the internet also needed some time. I hope so :D The price is only going down from my start.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:08:27
A private Key is a number with 77 digits, the first one is fixed. So there are (1)* 76^62 possibilites for one private Key. (one digit for one private Key can be a number 0-9 = 10 possibilites or a-z (26) or A-Z (26) - so total of 62 possibilities for one digit). Correct me if I am wrong. 
Question: Are all private keys given away? Or are there limits?
The result of the upper calculation is 407795774516946814422640158403946227852421944385088930185417432259366409596559192587201214777889031940708728649547776 possibilities for private Keys. If I would try one per day for 100 years I couldn´t get all of that, but even If 7 billion people would try 10000 private keys per day for 100 years they would only generate 2555000000000000000 possible private keys.
EDIT: It wouldn´t matter if there are bitcoins in there, I want to get all the private Keys in my wallet - when people create this key I can easily access these funds. Would there also be a problem with storage then?
@_date: 2015-09-09 12:02:59
You missed a f**k in the title. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:25:23
This is bullshit! Bitcoin XT and Core are not like Apple or Microsoft. Both want Bitcoin to be successful. And it does mean that they have way more knowledge than we have so you can say they are authoritative
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:12:10
[I know that feel.]( The more I read the more I think I am not getting it.
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:54:07
I think your point of view is a little far fetched, but no offense here. Sure they are competitors but other than apple and microsoft they work for the same product in the same company. But I get your point and agree that they are making "other products" and let the market choose, but all in all it´s bitcoin with a bigger blocksize or not.
