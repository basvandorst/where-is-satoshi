My exact same experience, expensive but they work.
They are official linden dollar reseller (They are primarily a second life exhange) So its not a nobody company that no one knows anything about.
I wouldnt worry just yet until we have more confirmation from other people.

you cant steal bandwith, its not like they get the badwith??
they actually need to use their own in order to contact you.
Also how is it stealing if your node allows public incomming connection, if you are think that is stealing I would start a whitelist and whitelist those ip's I wanted to share with and block the rest.
Its like being a streetartist and then get offended when people you didnt intend to show it to, saw your show. Well you shouldnt do it public then?!

I see people say this all time, yet is it really, thats some hardcore economic inside info about bitcoins biggest competitor.
I found it very interesting and relevant in my bitcoin life.

"There is a zero chance in hell that any economy could be currently functional with bitcoin."
There multiple economies functional with bitcoin, but bitcoin is only used in moderation but still currently part of many current economies. 
Claim 2:
"It can't do a single one of those things at one time, let alone all of them at once."
Truth: It can and does, maybe not used by so many people and maybe it wouldnt scale as good as you would like it too, but it can do all those things.
You said only 3 things I agree with:
1. "Bitcoin is limited" (But isnt everything?)
2. "The community is tiny" (Yes and that fits the current capabilities of the software very well)
3. "Most dont even barter with bitcoins" (Shouldnt people be free to do what they want with their money?)

According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by DollarDaze.org, there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Twenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21% were destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% were monetarily reformed, and 23% are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes. - Chris Mack
I may very well be that we are on the tipping point of large scale adoption, but to say that all else will fail if bitcoin does? Fiat fails all the time, how hard can it be? 
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:51:28
More irregular payouts.
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:53:37
Because bitcoin offers a unique set of properties that no other fiat currency offers.
That includes but not limited to:
transparent system (open source)
Not corruptible by evil individuals
Much cheaper to use

Yeah this is probably one of the most undervalued advice's out there, due to the amount of time it takes.

@_date: 2015-06-19 16:07:40
Uhmm yes we do.
And the only reason it isnt bigger is because banks are using systems to notice the issuing bank (Issuer of the check) that they have received a check and intent to cash it soon, that way much of the fraud is stopped, but it is far from over.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:45:09

The **safest** option would be Bitfinex swaps, thats safe as long as the Bitfinex exchange is safe.
Estimated return/day: 0.05-0.01 btc
The More **risky** option invest in a dice site like prcdice,
You will earn by investing in bankroll on site and you will earn on average 1% of all that is bet against it, however short turn fluctuations might send you in the red.
Estimated Return/day: 0.2-0.01 btc (Might even go negative)
Dont lend to people on btcjam or other sites like NOT worth it, dont invest in cloud mining, or mining contracts, if you know your shit buy a mining rig from someone else, but study it first. Mostly it wont be worth it for you, the risk of loseing your money is greater than the chance of doubleing your investment.

Of everything which we possess there are two uses: both belong to the thing as such, but not in the same manner, for one is the proper, and the other the improper or secondary use of it. For example, a shoe is used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe. He who gives a shoe in exchange for money or food to him who wants one, does indeed use the shoe as a shoe, but this is not its proper or primary purpose, for a shoe is not made to be an object of barter. - Aristotle
The exact same thing applies to lego, as lego are not made to be an object of barter.
Bitcoin is made to an object of barter. 
This is basic economic and politics 101.

@_date: 2015-06-18 12:22:13
Why should bitcoin be limited either remittance, business transactions, a store of value, or a global currency? why not everything at once? Why must the bitcoin community decide on one thing, dollars haven't decided on one thing and they are just paper not anywhere as advanced as bitcoin.
Bitcoin is an object of barter because barter is the primary use for bitcoins. (Read Satoshi's whitepaper)
In the same way a shoe's primary purpose is to wear. (See Nike commercials)
Lego's primary purpose is to play with (See toy companies)
Thats why we barter with bitcoins, wear shoes and play with lego, while you can do it the other way around that would be the improper way as stated by Aristotle.
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:16:36
lego is a toy so it is not comparable to bitcoin.
bitcoin is a payment type, thus comparable to USD that is also a payment type.

Its solid advice! We see it all the time, new people coming in, bitching about every price fall. Truth is that bitcoin is still so young that rich people/big investors control the price, NOT the masses of people. This makes bitcoin Highly volatile, in both directions.

I think you are wrong, it is okay to tip only 50 bits, if enough people do it it will be something.
Imagine youtube where the youtubers get payed in tips. Even if everyone that watched someones video only tipped 50 bits it would still be worth more than the ads i think.
this kind of mass tipping will bring more democracy to the internet.

We have already had several posts about how bad blockchain.info is. You can go look it up. Its simple, if you dont control the wallet you dont control the funds, dont give your money to a webwallet if you dont trust it to them.

@_date: 2014-11-17 04:18:37
This is way overkill over complicated for any use, the only part I support is the offline computer.
1. get old crap computer go to bitaddress.org save the websites code locally.
2. Take the old crap computer offline of everything forever.
3. Generate many new address from the local website code.
4. Save whatever you generate (in a txt file or whatever) And send some bitcoins to each address
Whenever you wanna spend bitcoins, write down one of the private keys and transfer it to a wallet, now you can only lose what was on that wallet and rest of the private keys will be safe.
No need to start ocr and webcams, thats really overkill. Just moving private keys by hand is much easier.
To make backup of this setup simply write down all the private keys on a paper and hide the paper somewhere safe.
This processes should take no more than a few minutes and is no less secure. This is not really keeping your electrum wallet safe, more like keeping your bitcoins safe.

Yeah this is all good until its not, apple could just change that any second.
The "Secure Enclave" is just software, it can be updated to be a "Not Secure Enclave", apple can update all the software and drivers to work in whatever way they want.
But I might be wrong I have not read a lot about Secure Enclave, actually I hope that i am wrong, it would be terrible if millions of people were to give apple their fingerprint.
I can imagine a scenario where the Secure Enclave were separated by hardware in such an obvious way that apple couldn't release an update that stole their fingerprint.
EDIT2: I can easily make a good honest program that works good, but people shouldn't trust it if I had exclusive right to change any code at any time.

Virwox is a good service, I have dealt with them before. 
Their fees are a little high, nearly 7% depending on how payment is made. 
They will increase your limit when you've made a few successful transactions. My current limit on Virwox is 300 euro.

i cant soo how this could work?
Even if rich individual successfully buys the sensitive information, what is to stop the leaker of just leaking the information an other place?
I see no incentive for rich individual to protect him/her self from a leak.
Also, another problem I see is, how do we confirm the information is true, it can only be done if another human reads it first, and whats stopping him from leaking it.
Interesting concept, but as I see it is impossible to make.
(or pointless should I say)

As I remember it is possible to to redirect ALL the traffic from your computer into tor network. I dont see why openbazzar shouldnt work with tor. But just wait until this is explained.
I think people dont want open bazzar to look like silkroad, so they try to keep people like you away, even though I think running it on tor would be totally possible.
HOWEVER, dont do this yet, as this is still very new, and what do I know right.
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:18:11
So what do you suggest until the bitcoin protocol is optimized it will not be possible to do micro tipping. Right now the transaction fee eats up the micro tips, making them useless, this is what changetip is fixing.
I cant wait until/if bitcoin's protocol gets more optimized, that could allow us to do tipping within the bitcoin system.
I like to imagine a system where all channels on youtube have a bitcoin adress and all browsers has build in addon that looks for bitcoin adresses on videos, so that you can quickly tip a video you find good.
THIS would transform bitcoin into consumer stage, but until then, lets not get big on tipping, tipping is not something bitcoin is good at, and thats the only reason changetip exist.

I could certainly see some kind of thing being build into bitcoin where bitcoins would be released based on certain conditions such as this specefic adress should get atleast x amount of this coin on it within x time to release funds.

well basically he is a guy that was active on bitcoin from the start and made a site called: bitcointalk.org, he openly allows scams to advertise there, he has the power to censor whatever he likes and promotes whatever he likes, he has gotten a lot of funding and are now paying one crappy programmer 300k a yeah to make bitcointalk.org better, and people dont agree with what is doing.
You can research you self.
But main points:
He has too much power
He uses donated money without care
He seems alot focused on profit
Oh and he is also a mod in here, so he controls the two main debate forums for bitcoin: and bitcointalk.org, thats the same issue you get when the same company own all the news media in USA, it gives monopoly and gives them enormous power, power that no one should have.

Now we have encouraged a lot of merchants to accept bitcoin, and we can use bitcoin almost everywhere.

"unlikely".. sure, but we cant build a world where we have to trust on rich person to not ruin EVERTHING. That just like wall-street and fiat. We cant trust the rich to not ruin it for the poor, they have no incentive to have our feelings considered. We should certainly take into account that satoshi have this control. I just figured I would rather lose all my money to satoshi who build this software than to lose it to rich families who are rich for doing nothing but being rich.

Not true.
Some fiat is confirmed stolen fiat, those serial numbers can be used by police to confirm these notes as stolen, that means, I can give you cash that are worth not so much, because you risk losing them if police finds them.
The same with bitcoin. Someone steals some bitcoin, the victim crys to community, and everyone is now looking out for those exact coins.
We have had exchanges that have said they would refuse certain stolen coins.
I have heard certain people say stuff like, I will pay 51 bitcoins, for an old completely unused block of 50 bitcoin.
Those unused 50 bitcoin are "clean". I know people dont like to hear this, but its true, and sometime in the future "clean" coins might be worth much.

Mining has allways been the "heavy work", Back in the days it was much easier to run fullnode due to smaller blocks and little space needed, but as soon as bitcoin gained some value there is no doubt mining was the "heavy lifting".
Your understanding is a bit clumsy, but I will let that be and answer your question instead.
Yes it is possible for a miner to choose to not include any transactions in the blocks, this happens from time to time, but most miners will include transactions because they get the fee from every transaction they include. Those miners that do not include transactions will get slightly less money and thus competition should push them out.
It is a basic and important thing that blocks are more profitable when transactions are included.
You must remember these miners are paid in bitcoins for their work, why would they try to destroy the value of their payment?
It sure is possible to attack the network, but its not profitable.
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:36:12
Yeah the protocol doesn't track it, but the protocol isn't the thing giving bitcoin value either.
People give bitcoin value, and people can track. It is on purpose that I have NEVER looked at the history of my coins, that means I can play the "stupid card" if anyone ever confronts me and my stolen coins, but truth is: "If it matters to some people (And it does), then its a factor in the value"

If you buy new computers with windows 8 they most certainly have fast boot and that takes just another layer to actually be able to boot from anything, I can certainly understand why one would wanna use an older computer, also it turns about that all new computers have their motherboard hacked and thus there is no security in booting anything from a new computer. (Just ask snowden)
Its the same when it comes to printers, it should be an older printer, one that dosnt connect to any network or store the files it prints.
Otherwise your printer will be a security concern too.

When you access blockchain.info you have no guarantee that they will actually use the "correct" source code. If they had actually only used the open source (approved by the community code) they wouldn't be in trouble. But you still have to trust them to use the correct source code and not expose your private keys to anyone. It adds another unnecessary layer of insecurity.
If you use blockchain.info you need to trust a company to get it right every time you access the page. Just one fuck up and many coins get stolen(as proven so many times). 
But Hey Trust/security is a subjective thing, I can understand some people might feel more secure with blockchain.info, or even banks! Or better yet, have your mother take care of your money. 
Do whatever you feel comfortable with.

What is the relationship between the miner and the node?
They are like brothers to each other, the difference being that one brother actually works (The miner) and the other just relaxes and talks to the miner/keeps him updated a lazy brother (The node)
Why can’t a miner simply solve the equation, claim the reward but without doing any heavy lifting?
Mining is the "heavy lifting" its very easy to run a node, quite hard to run a reasonable miner.

If this is true then why are every dollar unique? 
Why not make them all exactly the same, it would be much easier and much more transparent?
The government prints each dollar with a different signature, but tells us it doesnt matter. It matters for Robbers, theifs, counterfeits and people that just plain wanna be anon. All these places are people, so it matters to people, thus a factor in price. 
Don't believe everything the government or bank tells you, especially when they say stuff like: "No we are not at all tracking you", "These money are completely fungible", "These money cant be taken away from you".
All of which are obvious lies.

As I understand it bitcoin cant be "offline" Its a concept, the only thing that can be is how long between something happens on the network.
There was a downtime in the bitcoin network today!
It was down for 0.002 seconds, in that timeframe no one submitted any transactions and no miners relayed blocks.
But does that make the bitcoin network dead? I think not.
So question is how long should bitcoin stuff be dead before it is considered "downtime"
I imagine quite a lot of this "downtime" in the past when nobody used bitcoin.

"Well, no, but if they don't then you can plainly see that they aren't, because the js you're served will be different, and you can just not use the service."
While you could in theory check the javascript each time, almost no one is gonna do that, it would waste so much time that you would be better of just downloading the original code you trust and run it locally everytime. Ohh were have I heard about that before BITCOIN-QT.
"I'm not sure if I follow. They vulnerability in question was in free code."
This is why the: "(approved by the community code)" The blockchain.info source has not been checked as much as the plain bitcoin-qt branch, thus making it not so much aproved by the community, 5 people have contributed to blockchain.info and over 300 have contributed to bitcoin-qt.
"No you don't. You have to trust them to write an algorithm that securely generates private keys clientside, much like you trust bitcoin-qt to securely generate private keys clientside. This same vulnerability could have been introduced to bitcoin-qt just as easily."
Sadly that is just not the only issue, you have to trust them not to change the js as there is no way in hell you will actually check everytime. Again, if you did check the code everytime you loaded the page, why load the page? Why not download it and run it locally?

No? Where do you see anyone saying bitcoin is at risk?
I simply say that the number of available bitcoins will start to decline at one point and never will rise again without a serious hard-fork.
At some point in the very distant future there might not be any "whole" bitcoins left, there might only be fractions of a bitcoins left.
The number of bitcoins (read whole bitcoins) Will decline provided no hardfork changes it, no doubt.
But why should that be a risk for bitcoin?

If you are able to bruteforce a lost address, you also be able to bruteforce an active address, so naturally the bitcoin community would not allow this to happen. Instead we would use an even safer algorithm to encrypt the keys. If the computers can bruteforce sha256d im sure we will find an even better algorithm to use.
Otherwise bitcoins will be the least of our problems, as no encryption can exist in the scenario you describe and no one could communicate safe together, the whole world would change dramatically over night.
So hopefully we will continue to use an algorithm that can not be bruteforced.

I have seen this happen to a friend of mine, apparently localbitcoins said they had proof that buyer had wired the money, im guessing a tampered screenshot/html could fix that.
I have never used escrow when I sell, I simply demand they send first.
I know im kinda a dick on this, most people dont feel comfortable and I dont blame them. When it comes to gaining someones trust, I have found facebook to be the best ID. People can buy fake drivers-license and passport. But fake (legit looking) FB profiles are hard to find.

According to this info you got the btc for a price of 55 satoshi/doge.
On the 12. jan. the price was 58 satoshi/doge. 
So it depends on when you bought them. So when did you buy them?

You can use virwox/circle with mastercard. 
Virvow 6-7% fee
circle 1% fee

Yes I have bought 2000$ of bitcoin from circle with my nonUS mastercard.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:01:10
There is an eternal buy floor at 0.00001$/btc
Because I will buy every bitcoin that hits that price.. I will buy every 21 million of them if I have to, it will only cost me 210$
So I have no fear of bitcoin going to 0, its impossible. Only if math breaks.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:30:36
Yeah solutions exist, that doesn't mean people use them. Solutions exist for almost everything.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:51:47
Many people already do this.
I had one guy first make a legit trade with me, only have him say: "Now that you trust me can you send me 0.25 BTC now because my bank is a bit slow today" All the red flags went up.
I said he would have to wait until I could actually confirm the deposit was made, he got angry and threatened with all kinds of nasty stuff.
At one point I was nearly saying fuck it and would have just send it to him to get him to stop. Happy I didn't. 
Needless to say, the money never showed up, and all communication stopped.
So to sum up, from my experience it works better if you do it with small amounts and then threaten. That's also sometimes called robbing/stealing/scamming and can get you in jail for a long time.

Yes just the same way that you can theoretically buy all bitcoins. 
Its just impossible in reality, there will allways be someone that wont sell their bitcoins, and there will be people who wont send their bitcoins to miners.
If you envy miners you can choose to become one, its not too hard.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:19:11
Yeah that would explain it.
@_date: 2015-05-26 06:23:51
right now you pay for your bitcoins through you Electricity bill, not at all better than buying directly, you are just using a middleman.
If you like to mine then mine, but dont cheat your self, there is no what so ever profit gain from it. And if this is your stand then there is no stopping you from just mining bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-23 12:13:28

Yes I am serious. Are you?
Do you really believe that a little group of people can keep the price of bitcoin eternally suppressed? If people really want bitcoins, then at some point we are gonna run out of cheap coins and only more expensive coins will be left, that's the result of limited money supply, nothing changes that, shorters will at best only temporarily hold price down. I have used this opportunity to buy my self 50% more coins.

I used debit master card. It bought me for 500$ bitcoin instantly.
With little to no fee.
Edit: If I remember correctly virwox ended up having a fee of 6-7% while circle 1-2% or so. 
And that includes conversion between my local currency and dollar/euro, plus all the other banking fees there might be. So circle is no doubt cheapest.

The more hash/sec the more secure the network is, provided that no one entity gets more than 50% of the hash/sec.
Miners will scale to the price. We saw a boom in miners when bitcoin went up, we will see people shuttting off their machines when bitcoin goes down.

Ohh I I think I know why now. The main thing is that my country is not supported "officially" by circle yet, but my mastercard still works, so I have a hard limit of 500$.

@_date: 2015-01-13 18:27:00
Depends, it could get so low that one entity with a lot of mining rigs could turn them back on and have 51%. This is however not profitable as they would ruin the value of the goods they had just stolen, that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-13 09:37:49

We cant know, but the cost of an audit would be more than we have to lose so why do it? I agree if it becomes big and people use it to hold money and not just to tip we should.

You are wrong, at some point bitcoins can only be lost, and they will be I promise.
From that point, bitcoin is deflationary, it will however not be a problem for reason you mentioned. But there will indeed come a time when the number of bitcoins will only decline.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:31:32
Depending on where you live, this might and might not work.
A more expensive solution is virwox, but they charge 7% before you have you btc.
So you should really consider not buying with mastercard.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:12:17
Whenever he chooses I suppose.
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:22:29
This is why EVERYONE should stop reusing addresses. 
If everyone from now on did not reuse addresses this problem would disappear.
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:20:25
"This attack would have to be done as the coins were discovered"
This is not right, it all depends on how many blocks down the original transaction is. 
If it is lets say 15 blocks down then to get it reversed, the same entity would have to start 15 blocks down and begin mining out a new branch and then not include the 19000 BTC transaction. For this to work they would have to mine at their new branch with atleast 51% of the network, and they would need to do this until they overtook the original branch.
If 100% of the miners tried this could be accomplished much faster.
Now the trick is, how do you convince 51% of all bitcoin-miners (People who like decentralized stuff) to centralize their power for you.
It has not been done yet, and probably never will be.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:00:57

@_date: 2015-01-21 13:37:11
I'm pretty sure that those bitcoins getting shorted aren't the "real" reason the price is low, only part of it. If the shorting at Bitfinex is the sole reason low price, we will see soon enough.
I'm swapping, and see nothing wrong with it, I get:
1. Interest that's bigger than ever (For me)
2. Cheaper coins
3. A bigger slingshot for when the price finally decides to go the other way
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:36:14
I'm sure some banks will try to fractional reserve the shit out of bitcoin in the future, but they will have to change from banks to investment companies as people can clearly see they do not own the bitcoins they have promised you.
Atleast we can know now how much fractional reserving the banks are doing.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:11:55
But as bitcoin is very easy to prove proof of reserves in, we are going to see people demand it if hosted wallets starts shutting down like fractional reserve banks.
I have never heard of one bank that offers proof of reserve, but multiple bitcoin wallet providers does this! Its good progress.

It still requires some guesswork and risk. Imagine this scenario-1:
Person: Deposits 1 million usd on exhange shitgox
shitgox: quickly buys bitcoin as they think price is about to rise
person: changes his mind and withdraws the usd again
Conclusion: shitgox paid too much for bitcoin that there was no demand for, shitgox loses money.
Person: Deposits 1 million usd on exhange crypshit
cryptshit: quickly buys up all the bitcoin as they think price is about to rise
person: decides to short bitcoin with his 1 million usd
Conclusion:  Crypshit now owns a lot of bitcoin they paid above marketprice for and the market just crahed because some guy shorted bitcoin for 1 million usd, cryptshit lost money.
There are endless variations, if someone deposits a lot of money there is no guarantee anything will happen and you cant predict what he will do with it. Even from the position of exchange owner there is no free lunch only slightly better intel.

Exploiting is quite dangerous practice.
If they want to gain from it they have to invest some of their own currency into bitcoin or bitcoin into currency thus exposing them to risk, if they dont get greedy they could do this quite successfully for a  long time (Mtgox did operate for a long time), but if they get unlucky they might end up on the wrong side thus having to dubbledown or cut their losses, mtgox choose to doubledown and lost, then trying to fake getting hacked (They might have been hacked who knows actually).
But still, they have to invest to exploit this advantage and bitcoin markets are a crazy place to invest.

I think some miners can be profitable at a bitcoin value of 10 usd/btc. I mean if you have free electricity and difficulty drops enough thats certainly possible.
but as of current: a calculation for me would be.
pay 440 usd for antminer S7.
Pay 9.44 usd in electricity per day.
so price would need to be about 800 usd/btc to break even on electricity alone.
and after the halving the price would need to be double that.
Mind you electricity is highly taxed in Denmark that is the reason it would probably never be profitable for me.
In china I can only guess but they could be profitable in 200 usd/btc.
All depending on wages, price of electricity, price of equipment and if you value your own time setting up and adding risk of failure on the devices and much much more.

Sure potential for big payout sounds good in theory but in practice it means if bitcoin became the one true currency in the world today. Satoshi would own about 10% of the world. I like Satoshi and think he should be rewarded for creating bitcoin, but I dont think 10% of the whole world is a fair price. Thanks for creating Bitcoin your reward is New York, Tokyo, Spain, Google, Bill gates and Belgium. We will just give him 10% of the world... like really?? I fucking hope his coins are lost its too big of a chunk for any one person to own (if bitcoin becomes mainstream that is).

Option1: You need the wallet to reload the balance somehow from scratch. If your wallet has a seed for backup. Write it down, then delete the app, open again and use the seed to restore the wallet.
This should force the app to download all transactions again and realize yours never got anywhere. This will only work though if the peer you are getting your transactions from has pruned it too.
Option2: Export the private keys from wallet to another wallet, and again if your transaction has been pruned it wont show up in this new wallet.

yeah it does sound weird but im sure that if they wont include it in the blockchain it will be dropped completely at some point. But it still sucks. You should mail the dev of the app you are using (get him to add a custom fee option).

I lost exactly one bitcoin in the mt gox hack. I could never get aproved because I couldn't log into my account for some weird reason no one could ever explain to me.
The fact that my name and adress on the account match my real name and adress (I proved to them) didnt help. I had to be able to log in to the account, and thats the brick wall. I suspect other people might have experienced this. I tried on several occasions but the website was buggy and nothing was working(tried password recovery among other things). Mind you at the time the bitcoin price was quite low (compared to now) and seeing as I would only get a fraction of a bitcoin back I thought it not to be worthwhile to throw any more hours away. I still have the official letter I got from japan.

Most big exchanges are "safe enough" as long as you are in and out very quickly.
If you are in and out in a couple of days you have an about 1/250 - 1/500 chance of being caught up in a hack. So if you buy many small amounts you can factor it in as being an additional .4% - .2% fee you pay to hackers and corrupt exchanges. Not too bad actually.
I would avoid bitfinex for a few months still though until they prove themselves a bit more.

Oh shit 2 Bitcoin experts saying completely different things, can we get a third opinion?
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:49:20
The adoption numbers im talking about is not even that much.
Lets say Bitcoin is now at 600000 active users, on average we would be able to send 1 transaction per day, and that asumes no stupid 0 transaction blocks.
If we increase blocksize by factor of 10 we will get a factor of 10 more space for transactions NOT factor 1000 or factor 100.
ALL THIS is regardless of the fees you pay.
No matter how big a fee you place there can only be 600k transactions per day and if we increase to 10mb blocks that would be 6 million transations per day.
Greecee has a pop of 11 million so on avarage after the block increase we would be able to send one transaction every other day, again, REGARDLESS of the fucking fee, the fee doesnt not solve shit!
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:52:04
If useage go up by a factor of ten, then only 1 in 10 people would be able to get their transaction through regardless of what fee is paid.
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:03:47
If enough people just wanna pay a higher fee then a higher fee wont do anything.
A certain number of transactions can be sent per day (350k) if all of grecee joined bitcoin today then they would be able to send less than one transaction per day each, and then it wont matter what fee you put on.
TLDR: Fees does not solve scaleability problems
@_date: 2017-04-23 10:02:39
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. So this is NOT the right place to ask.

While you could indeed easily get rid of a lot of bitcoin quikcly that way, an easier method would be to send it to a burn address.
And while that would remove some bitcoins from the world, the wealth is not lost, simply transferd to all the other bitcoin holders.

Yeah i like haasbot better too, you just gotta decide if you wanna pay 0.22 for a limited subscription service.
Quatloo is absolutely free, so for people not really experienced traders should start with quatloo, if they are good and make money they can consider investing in better software.

You can probably buy it from someone, I would be happy to ship one to you for only the cost of the storage medium and shipping. 
Otherwise use a torrent so you can control the download process easier, download bootstrap file in a torrent client, it will be closer to 30 gigs(Not sure as bootstraps seems to have gone out of fashion).

there is one. I just created it.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:37:19
In my area it would take 7+ years for the best miner in the world to earn itself in(considering electricity and shipping). Then I am essentially making a bet about if I think the miner will last that long. 7 years is much more than the expected lifetime for such a product. In seven years the difficulty will be very different and the price will probably be aswell, so its a gamble that isnt even profitable.

surely a compressed torrent would be less in size?
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:08:57
I use this one  
however mycellium is a popular choice just be careful that you dont download a scam wallet and remember that these apps dont give full coincontrol, so stuck transactions or other more advanced things might not be available.
Also remember to backup your wallet so if you lose your phone you wont lose your money too.
buying bitcoins monthly is an excellent strategy. You wont feel big swings in bitcoins price nearly as much and you dont have to put a lot in a down payment.
@_date: 2015-11-18 08:05:52

Yeah, I was 17 when I got into bitcoin, I have a bank account, but because im underage, my control over the money is very limited, I had like a 100$ withdraw limit a week or something, so I couldnt buy anything expensive, it was such a pain!
Bitcoin gave me liberty.
Its also the young that are going to be the future people anyway, I gave up explaining it to my father, when I realized the amount of time he had used to explain the internet to my grandfather, its a generation thing, bitcoin will succeed, but dragging it onto the old generation will be way to much waste on energy.

Probably it wont fit very well, banks are very regulated I do think his hands are tied, unless he spends a shitload of money on lawyers go find out how he can integrate bitcoin into his bank in a profitable legal way.
If his bank is just a little bit big, he should be prepared for other banks to start and pressure him into not accepting bitcoin.
Its stupid to force a lion and a lamb to live under the same roof.
I really like bitcoin, but he might consider it best to keep his bank stuff away from it, and then use bitcoin in private.

I googled: "most anonymous money"(Or something like that), because I figured that the most anonymous money would not care for my age, as that would compromise my anonymity. I found some suggestions about gold and cash.
Then I think I googled elctronic cash, and I think I googled "what money does criminals use" as I figured criminals can be of all ages, and wouldn't care for my age.
Thats how I fell upon bitcoin, I downloaded the qt client (At the time the blockchain was very small).
**Edit: OHHH shit got carried**
**Random extras:**
It just clicked and I realized to immense potential.
For me, silkroad was a proof that bitcoin was working as intended and not a scam.
I am now well past 17, but I stuck with bitcoin, I keep a little more of my lifesaving than I should in bitcoin, but im rich enough to take the fall should it come.
The key-point to more adoption I think is to proove to people that it all works.
I visited silkroad a few times (Did not buy anything), but just looking at all these anon people and criminal activity right before my eyes, even though I had a record of every bitcoin transaction right on my computer, it all worked.
I know people dont like the fact that criminals were the ones to kickstart bitcoin, but I think that the fact criminals use it, just proves that it works.
I got my first part of a bitcoin: 0.001 from a faucet, it took me like a day, and still wasnt much, but it was enough for me to play around with.
I wanted more so I bought my first whole bitcoin at virwox, they would allow me to buy instantly even though i was under 18.
I have been collecting ever since.
I now have around 21 bitcoins.
I have bought 10+ humble bundels for some of those, and I have bought some other electronics too.
I have made paper wallets, but I dont trust my printer, so I will wait a while before I send most of them offline.
Bonus info:
I lost 1 bitcoin in goxxing, but not for the reason you would think.
I lost it because mtgox demanded proof I didnt have when I wanted to withdraw from mtgox.
@_date: 2015-11-18 08:24:32
I think I get what your saying now, didnt quite understand it right away.
And I agree that no one should put all their wealth in one place, spread it out a bit.
however I would also say that bitcoin is the safest alternative right now for large amounts of wealth.
And thus it should hold to largest amount of wealth.
We can still spread a little of the wealth out on the much unsafer alternatives as "banks" and gold. 
This is just my personal opinion, as far as I can see nothing beats bitcoin when it comes to security (as long as you know how to utilize it).

@_date: 2015-03-27 12:30:29
Yes but the bank would have to pay a fee (Or pass it along to the customer) 
The bank can very well hold its own bitcoin, and just buy and sell them as costumers of the bank invest in bitcoin or divest from bitcoin.
I am not aware of legal aspects, and they are what i would be afraid of, but in practice its very easy to do.
Bonus tip: The bank can avoid evil exchanges by only buying a little amount at a time and only transferring more money onto the exhange when the bitcoin has been withdrawed. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:37:54

When a lot of people think a dump is comming they will try to be faster and dump first, probably the stolen coins has been sold of slowly over the past few months, the only reason the scam ended now was because too many was trying to withdraw at the same time.

pack it all together take the sha256 fingerprint of the rar file or whatever, then distribute that fingerprint in a transaction you make from a privatekey only you control.
That then you can sign a message from that private key that says you are the owner. Im sure some kind of altcoin makes this easier, but the idea is the same.

Yes and we could have a big community look over the open-source 3D printer drawing of a complete computer, once certified we could trust it like any open source thing. It would be one hell of a task though.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:53:30
Im afraid you are right, also because open-source software is just on the tip of being "trust able" due to many programmers that makes the verification of open source software somewhat decentralized.
But we have even less people who can verify the hardware at the core level, so it would be much more centralized verification and thus less trust able.
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:37:17
WTF that is a crazy minimum :O
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:39:58
I havent done any test my self and I would say probably not, its heavy program to run, but I found it to be very fast indeed, its still quite early though so they have a lot left to improve upon.
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:50:49
Becuase it didnt make people wanna buy more bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:44:35
Yeah but the but you are limited to a maximum of 1 api call per minute so that kinda sucks.
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:21:03
Why is that? Do you care to explain why today is so special?
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:12:40
This should be higher, as much as I like bitcoin I think they laughed rightfully.
Bitcoin was not the correct solution to the problem. Its not bitcoins fault, but thats how it is, hopefully some day it will be correct solution.
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:37:54
Local bitcoins if possible. But that would take a looong time.
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:57:18
My initial experience was good too, but I guess that got in problems with fraud, and had to tighten up.
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:20:44
Why? What is this based on?
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:12:15
Dont tell people to mine, their are no normal computers that can make anything but a few satoshis a day.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:55:03
Can you create a bitcoin key-set using ONLY pen paper and dice? I would love to see an example! Have been looking for this for a long time.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:34:39
Then you just have to trust the trezor team's hardware.
Why would you trust that?
I find that I trust my old computers to not have hardware spy inside.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:57:03
Yet, but think about how small a GPS is, think about how little time is left before everything can have a satellite connection, you might not be able to stop you device from going on the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:53:11
yeah we could vote on seansoutpost!
Where do I vote?
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:06:22
You should hang arround in you will surely earn a lot more a lot quicker.
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:26:45
I see! It all makes sense, watch out people the rise will be a great one!
Edit ( I still dont understand )

Bitcoin is very male dominated, ceo positions in a company are very male dominated, so naturally a "bitcoin company ceo" is very very male dominated.
 
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:22:33
People will hate me for telling you this, as this is considered grafitti on the blockchain.
But use a vanitygen to generate custom public key with you message.
and then send bitcoins to them.
Then you could end up with a transaction chain of
1 btc send to 1Iamanidiot24JJ3Hj43Kk3
1 btc send to 1Because3kkse44jeEJ4jee4
1 btc send to 1Ispam49dj4j6jj44sdijir49j
1 btc send to 1blockchain293jddh4uh4hrh

Hello Bit Bit
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:39:06
True, take a satellite phone instead.
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:05:00
Hi :)
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:29:21
Sounds cool! 
I will miss being able to verify the result with my eyes :/ Because then I have to trust the microscope I use is not rigged.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:44:00
Bitcoin is a hard thing to day trade I would advice against it atleast we stop having our bitcoin stolen.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:49:01
Dont see the connection to bitcoin yet, but I like the game and found the solutions interesting!
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:43:48
You are on point! 
Maybe some of the old computers will be NSAfree, but they will be rare gems, and slow as fuck.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:50:00
Copy by hand is a good idea!
I heard others describe a setup where your offline computer uses a webcam that captures QR codes from the screen of a online computer, this way of moving data is a ONE-way street. So you can be sure you offline storage is not compromised.
Moving data back again must be done by hand.
You cant trust the space of the usb is what it says, the firmware could be rigged to show false information regarding space.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:51:13
Bitcoin currently uses a lot of computer hardware of this kind.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:17:39
Then trade and when you stop trading you withdraw.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:58:26
Never mind I found them, to anyone else having trouble with client freezing, just delete the coinswap folder in appdata and delete the .mercury folder that is placed in the [username] folder, this will probably delete it all though so dont do it if you have value in the app.
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:39:32
Yeah yeah I got that part, but what did they "dooo". What was the purpose for allcrypt to exist?
@_date: 2015-03-26 08:35:08
Yeah this could have been an easy task had all people just used crypto, but the people in are mainly focused at the dollar perspective.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:46:25
How will you know you actually succeeded in flashing it? How do you know its not the virus acting as if it had been flashed? When it comes to hardware level virus, you cant be sure.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:02:48
Do you have any reference?
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:20:01
Yes they have lots of experience and have been around for a long time, never had troubles. But they are costly as fuck.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:52:13
No you are right, so we are lucky to have charities that are not exchanges! 
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:51:28
No this is very bad.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:54:41
yeah :/ and Lighthouse disappointment aside.
even then.. this is still a more bitcoin friendly company than 90% of other companies.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:32:33
Nice try NSA
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:15:51
Where do you use bitcoin in your business?
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:12:00
Seems almost too good to be true, any side effect that could harm bitcoin?
Anyone else who can confirm this is as crazy as it sounds?
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:49:14
I might throw in an offer too.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:39:40
This! and deposit I would say was also a criteria. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:45:20
Where I live minors can have debit cards, and a debit card is only thing needed to buy on circle.
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:38:37
So what? He was just asking, no need to get nasty.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:58:40
And how will this in anyway help drive mainstream adoption? It wont.
What is needed is something much simpler.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:57:41
How would you know that the open source software is really in control of the hardware and the virus is not simply acting?
@_date: 2015-10-10 02:46:52
I got an ekstra verification code I did not ask for, maybe they sent the code to the wrong phone number.
Or my email/pass is compromised and I should change it.
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:02:16
They changed it then, I remember when I pointed it out a few weeks ago, I was ridiculed by the community and they said it was on purpose because devs. didnt want rich people to buy everything.
Appears they changed their minds.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:30:13
So we don't have to use compromised computers silly.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:46:50
Ohh so you have to pay money to the gov to become a charity.. NICE!
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:24:37
Not one person in my family sees the world as I do, everyone disagrees.
They all have heard about bitcoin (Thanks to me) but they don't get the idea they don't see the smart aspects of it. So even if I tried to give it to them they probably wouldn't take it.
I think of heritage as a way to reward great genes.
If a man has earned enough to give his son a great heritage he probably was of great importance to the community, and thus we will help those genes survive.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:02:57
It might choose to connect to the internet by other means. 
The military owns many satellites who knows, maybe your device connects to them, you wouldn't even notice it, satellite phones and GPS's are getting very small.
@_date: 2015-10-10 02:53:34
Knowing that you have 42 bitcoins there can no longer 1 million people in the club. 
Only 999999 because you take up 2 spots in the 1 million club.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:32:37
Its not greedy to not wanna starve. If you perform a service you deserve to be compensated.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:47:09
People make fun of tinfoil hats. But maybe we should all make tinfoil hats for our computers, then we would be protected by laws of physics
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:56:03
Space might become an issue. Dont fill a room with miners that makes you 0.00001btc/year, its a waste of room.
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:24:06
Yeah you would think, but I just quickly read the github, and it appears that the price of this is making bitcoin easier to Dos.
There is no such thing as a free meal, this is very impressive but it should be known that it comes with a price.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:54:54
We must all learn to create bitcoin key-pairs with pen, paper, and dice, it should be taught in school.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:09:50
My solution is just a little more easy to understand. I agree on it being very bad, but it works and is easy to use. 
And very efficient should you just want a couple of lines in the blockchain why bother to learn wtf OP_RETURN is and read a lengthy discussion on the matter, it might simply not be worth it for a few words.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:27:51
There would almost no way of knowing.
But you can try and figure out how big the community is lets say it is 500000 active bitcoiners or whatever, they create a constant demand and supply, if however a "third party" were to arrive and create enormous amounts of demands (Like a bank would) then price would increase a lot in order to tempt people to sell to them. The price might also just increase because of more adoption so I guess the most precise way to know would be to use 
Where you can get a rough estimate of number of active bitcoiners and see if it correlates with price movement, if it does not it means that some enormous actor just bought in.
Worth to note that "banks" in the physical sense buy nothing at all, its just people so I guess what you refer to is not necessarily banks but just rich people in general. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:20:18
If consider it compromised when the NSA can get to it? yes.
But to be fair their is probably thing you can Hide from NSA anyways.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:50:28
Probably not secure from NSA, but they probably wont care either.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:30:54
Then you do the calculations twice?
@_date: 2013-08-31 17:21:08
If people **sell** their btc on *mt gox* to get the money out, they would **sell** the btc on other *Exchanges* right after, That would create some unnatural low prices for btc on the other *Exchanges*. 
So the CORRECT way of calculating the REAL price is to include mt gox but otherwise I agree with you.
