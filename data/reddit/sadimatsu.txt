Ok, so it took me a while. I started this at around 3pm. I had to first install mint on this crappy slow netbook with an atom processor. slow as dog shit. Anyway, I downloaded it, and setup a new lab. lab was like this:    
netbook------switch(3750)-------firewall (asa 5520)
Setup the network, iped everything, allowed snmp pulling on the outside interface and and then it was time to do the do. 


and then I got an error. I was like WTF


New versioin? so, i did a show version and found  out this ASA was on 9.0 train. This only works on the 8.x to 8.4.  Im like FUUUU. my coworker had upgraded it a while back because we were going to deploy it somewhere, but we ended up not doing so. At that time it was around 5:45 and I had to leave. So, I work from home tomorrow, so my co worker who had to leave earlier, is probably going to finish the job. I'll tell you tomorrow, if not thursday when I go back to work. 
here is the the instructions by the way

I tested extrabacon and it worked like a charm.  
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:27:04
I'm about to test one of tools. Extrabacon. Using SNMP to gain access to an ASA. If this works, this is some fucked up shit.
