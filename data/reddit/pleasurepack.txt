I don’t get why he is being downvoted he is simply explaining that Roger Ver is a piece of shit scam artist and I think we can agree that douche is a plague to the actual bitcoin community now.  He literally blows up and screams when someone calls BitcoinCash “Bcash”  because he’s afraid of the brand having its own identity not linked to the original REAL bitcoin.  The fact that Ver is ostracized by many in the community for his antics only goes to show how unwanted his contributions are

I see what you mean now.  I did not dwell too much on the idea of futures and its effect on bitcoin because I saw it as the financial world becoming more engrossed and tied into the idea of cryptos.  All of my investments are long positions (10+) so I'm really focusing on end game.  
In essence though I only saw it as a positive and wanted to get in before they were implemented in the first place.
What are your thoughts on the immediate future...of futures? haha

The FUD has been ongoing for years now has it not?
The gray area of "FUD" can probably be argued for any emerging topic that has not fizzled out with all the information laying out on the table which would in turn mean we know exactly the worth lol

Yeah was not the best haha

Yeah I’m not surprised that the trailer does not give you every detail of the movie.
That’s what watching it is for my friend haha
*disclaimer* the movie was veryyyyy “meh”
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:37:02
Yeah I attributed it to her just not knowing how to use whatever application or wallet she had in the movie.  Not the best way to show bitcoin for sure but I mean most people including Hollywood studios know almost nothing of the inner workings of Bitcoin.  It’s a start though

I see where you’re coming from.  Do you mean privacy concerns in the sense of my personal life being online or getting my crypto stolen?  (I don’t own any worth stealing, I just know BTC is the future)

Do not mistake the governments debt as its own.  Through quantitative easing and bond production the people DO in fact take on that debt, we just don’t see very well past the smoke and mirrors

I give this douche 2 months until he gets his ass kicked

The availability is the problem, none until July.  They are not worldwide in terms of shipping yet so you have to reach out to them specifically to set up buying from the USA.  I have actually already reached out to them to be able to do so for a video! :)

I don’t understand why being an early Bitcoin adopter would make me an egocentric imbecile

Excuse me, my American is showing haha
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:42:24
Solid advice.
Thanks my dude, always looking out for ways I can improve my videos! 
I’ve used music before (got a lot of complaints...some like it some don’t I guess) but I will work on graphics and animations so I don’t bore people to death haha
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:28:51
Big props for taking the time to get back at me with your input I can’t thank you enough for it. 
I’m not even a month into making videos so I have a lot to learn and there’s definitely a bit of a curve for newbies haha I work full time doing medical sales so the little time I do have left over I try to make into somewhat of a quality video. I’ll most likely just work every night and only post once a week or so and just do impressive videos eventually
@_date: 2018-07-26 00:17:51
Yeah I think it'll be a while.  Probably not even in 2018
