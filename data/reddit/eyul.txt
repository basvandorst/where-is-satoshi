You don't have to investigate. Its optional. Luckily there would be many leads if the thieves actually used the stolen BTC.

If the FBI wants to track stolen BTCs is it that bad for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:59:51
It is just a notification. The seller can still accept it, but may contribute greatly to the investigation if he so chooses.
The idea is not to hold those who are not using the system responsible for the stolen bitcoins, but to let them know and enable them to do something about it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:06:30
If your friend pays you, and you discover that he sent stolen coins - wouldn't it be good to get notified and thanks to the history log, figure out quickly who he got it from? ..which he can then send the report to, so the previous holder can quickly see where he got it, etc.. As long as the entire history of the stolen funds is kept, with the date and time of each transaction - it should be quite easy to figure out who you got it from and let him/her/them know, so they can do the same.. 
A notification with the transaction history is the key.
The idea is not to block funds.
The idea is to follow the trail to the thieves. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:57:25
It's only a notification, that could actually alert the payer as well that he has received stolen funds. He can investigate the further to track the source, if he cares about bitcoin..

The service monitors stolen funds like the community does today. It monitors  all the movements and simply notifies any receiver who signed up when stolen funds are paid to him. This is not in order to block the transaction, but could help in finding out the identity of the thief.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:55:38
The service is tracking officially stolen funds - so only the service operator can add tracked bitcoins (such as MtGox's)
Anyone can add (also with an API) addresses + email address/sms# for the notification.
So no such risk..
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:03:21
Replied here b4 that the terms of the service can be that blocking is not allowed. It is only a tool to help tracking back stolen funds to the thieve.
If a merchant use it to block users - he will be blocked from the service. Simple..
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:59:56
You seem to assume that people wouldn't want to accept the funds. This would not be the case if the service brands itself as a tool to help track back stolen funds, rather than rejecting them.
It can be specifically noted in the user agreement for this service that blocking funds is not allowed, and if buyers are complaining about it - the service will be terminated to the blocker. Easy fix.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:46:16
If your address ever held stolen bitcoins then it is marked. When you pay to any service it is notified, and would probably let you know that the BTC you got two weeks ago were stolen. You may choose to notify the entity from which you received it two weeks ago... And he could check from whoever sent that to him..
Actually, the notification could include all the historic addresses and the date the stolen funds moved between them, to help the community get to the source... 
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:40:30
That would be a good motivation for them to use the service, that if they want to help bitcoin to become safer. Once they get a notification of the unsolicited transaction, they can simply forward the same amount from the same address to a certified "whitewashing" address like a charity or a faucet - thus redeeming themselves.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:47:07
The purpose of that is to allow to trigger investigation, rather than discriminating BTC over BTC
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:49:06
He has nothing to gain by sending it to small wallet. Notification just triggers investigation.. Unsolicited transactions would not be a problem at all.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:47:20
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:06:06
Its not about ur coins being clean or dirty. It is not about blocking. That could be outlawed in the user agreement for that service.
It is just a method to enable tracking back the stolen funds to the original thieve.
No fungibility issue here

Thanks! It's great to see others have been thinking about similar concepts. I've [commented]( on the second post - pasting it here as well:
We've been working on a solution for these challenges in the last few months and released the whitepaper draft yesterday. We named it "Bancor Protocol". I believe it addresses most if not all the issued raised here as well as offer additional utility.
The solution is based on user-created "Bancor-enabled tokens" (BETs) which hold other standard ethereum tokens (reserves), with a user-defined "Constant Reserve Ratio" (CRR) for each of the held reserves in a specific BET. BETs autonomously issue themselves in exchange for reserve tokens, and transfer reserve tokens to holders destroying BETs. The price is calculated continuously according to the CRR and the reserve balance, so the market-cap of a token with a 10% CRR in ETH would be its [ETH balance] / [ETH CRR]. 
A token with multiple reserves calculates its own market-cap, in each of its reserves. When the calculated market-caps are not equal in value (i.e. do not match the external market-prices) an incentive to arbitrage and realigned them is created. 
BETs holding multiple reserves totaling 100% CRR would function as decentralized ETF, while BETs with less than 100% CRR function as new currencies, creating new credit gradually as they grow, and are intrinsically liquid.
We would be happy to get any feedback and comments on the first draft of the whitepaper.

I share the same belief :)


Well, it is very different from how markets operate today, just like bartering is different than buying and selling with money. While bartering requires matching two opposite "wants", money is the technology which solves this problem — today's exchanges require matching two opposites wants to convert between currencies, and programmable-money (smart-contract-based tokens) is the technology that holds the potential to solve this problem.


It is not very different from various currency pairs which are traded in multiple exchanges today (e.g. BTC:ETH). Price discovery already happens in different markets simultaneously, while arbitrage agents push down the price gaps between them. These dynamics work in the same way with Bancor.


BETs can also be created in order to be primarily used as a reserve-token in other newly created BETs. A collection of BETs which are backed by the same backing-BET, establish a token-network, in which the backing-BET encapsulates the value of the network-effect (so as demand for a BET in the network increases the demand for the backing-BET, which is needed in order to purchase it, thus increasing the value of all BETs backed by it)
BGT is the genesis token network, backed by ETH. The demand for BGT is expected to increase with every new BET holding BGT in reserve — increasing the value of all the BETs with BGT in their reserve. 
As the system is hierarchical, one could imagine multiple levels of network tokens. For example BGT on a global scale but local currencies in India backed by a new network BET, capturing their network value, and backed by BGT.

The core of the problem is governance though. Awesome technology is not built by voting. Voting is only needed where vacuum of leadership exists and it usually establishes several self re-enforcing camps that can be manipulated. That is the main challenge Bitcoin faces (and probably your government, too).
The implication is clear - inefficiency.

File sharing services are among the most popular paid services online. Many file sharing services have affiliate programs. File sharing network that will be based on bitcoin would benefit from the anonymity of both the customer and the affiliate/uploader who may receive a percentage of the income via bitcoin. No need even to register.

"The manipulator" is out of bitcoins. Notice that the uptrend has begun right after the largest bitcoin sale in history - 400k bitcoins (5% of the total bitcoins in a single sale). Now, that the manipulator has no more bitcoins, nothing can stop the price from rising. We should take into consideration that the manipulator may have another stash, and he's trying to create another bubble and burst it.. But as long people don't get hysterical when the price goes down - he will fail. The short term, non-believers-speculators are mostly out of the market at this point - so we're probably going to see bitcoin climbing slowly to approx. $5m/BTC - as it replaces the US$

I'm pretty damn sure that there is new information there, that you will find very interesting and be able to verify independently from other sources you currently trust (that if you're not too scared, like most people, to do so). Give it a go for once in your life. Be a free thinker. Try to point a single thing in this article that is inaccurate.. If you feel deep fear right now - ignore it and do it anyway. If you think you need to let me know that I'm a tinfoil hat looney, do it - but also look at the information that I've put forward. Ignore your fear (even if it feels like contempt at the moment) - and try to face the alternative views of reality - and then decide for yourself what makes more sense to YOU. Don't decide on it out of ignorance... There is a saying.. Judgment without observation is the sign of stupidity, observation without judgement is the sign of intelligence. Observe what I've posted, without judging it in advance - if you dare :) good luck with your programming carear..

It was clear all the way that eventually the price will start to rise, when the manipulators runs out of bitcoins - since the speculators ran away long ago. That leaves us with actual users and long term investors (that will not sell in the next few years no matter what happens). This means that at this point, no matter how much money you have, you will not be able to manipulate the price of bitcoin downward. You can only create a bubble and explode it, but you will always rebound to the base price of the users and long term buyers. That's simply because hysteria scares away the speculators and no one else. There are many miners, the manipulators are surely some of them, which sell everything they mine immediately. Currently, the demand in the marketplace is slightly higher then the supply by the miners so the price will keep going up. If bitcoin mathematics stay solid, and Internet would remain free - I estimate a target price at the range of $5,000,000/BTC, but that could take many years.

The first method of digital money transfer was the banking network (swift). It has been around for over 40 years and it can work for any fiat currency that is centrally managed. It is privately owned.
The second method of digital money transfer was bitcoin. It is not a centrally managed currency, but a decentralized one (like silver and gold). 
So bitcoin is the birth of the first decentralized digital currency,  the second digital currency system to be available worldwide, and, of course, since its decentralized, it is the first liquid digital currency that is truly open and democratic.
It takes different amount of time for different people to realize how huge bitcoin is - but inevitably more and more people would realize it and are realizing it every day, intuitively or intellectually. 
Bitcoin is for Bank Networks, like the Internet was to the privite data services of AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserv. 
There isn't really a competition here, just a process of increasing awareness &amp; understanding of a superior solution.

Protocols are replaced only by superior protocols. That actually may happen to bitcoin, but it would take a very gradual process of economic growth same as it took for bitcoin.

"Looks professional" is subjective. I invested in bitcoin early on exacly since I define "looks professional" differently than most people. I think the tradditional "professional" is usually a closed minded, authority starving, MBA-brain - and I dont want to get my money even close to those guys. I prefer the casually dressed Zuckerbers.. I believe that guys like him who don't give a shit about suits are the modern professionals (And in this case, of bitcoin, the returns were indeed quite outstanding in just two short years)

Your comparison to Gnutella was the best you had.. And Gnutella was replaced, gradually and slowly, by a superior open protocol - bittorrent - over several years, exactly as i described (and you replied that its just my "hope" - so consider it just might be my "ability to learn from past experiences" :) And Gnutella was not even remotely close in terms of adoption investment - to bitcoin today. Bitcoin is as stoppable as email and HTML at this point. If you had realized it 16 days ado you would have been a more wealthy person by now.

It seems like you think of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle (such as stocks, forex)
Where I think of Bitcoin as a dominant and quite successful technology related standard (such as email or HTML) only it's not about empowering people to send text and images to each other, it's not about empowering people to publish dynamic content - it is about empowering people to trade between themselves using a decentralized, digital currency (a "digital silver/gold" if you will)
Did you notice that the gold standard was dropped as soon as fiat money gained the advantage of becoming digital? But I digress..
Such digital communication standards maintain a very different growth patterns when compared to any kind of investment - especially after the adoption has been proved to be growing consistently for a long period of time. This indicates a viral "word-of-mouth" growth and its the most powerful distribution mechanism that I know of.
The important parameter with Bitcoin is adoption - not the current "speculative" price. The adoption is growing fast (over 500k users now) and every new user is more fiat money pumped in. The adoption of new open-source decentralized standards is especially powerful because there is no corporation that otherwise would be likely to abuse the power he has over a product that maintained a similar viral growth (think any Internet giant that is down trending in terms of adoption)
Therefore, I believe bitcoin is unstoppable at this point.

Bitcoin is the first digital money that is operated by the people rather than the authorities. Did you ever notice that as soon as money became digital (thus gaining a huge operational advantage over traditional "decentralized" currencies such as gold and silver) in the late 60's - the gold standard was dropped? Since then privetly-operated digital fiat currencies have been the only digital monetary solution. 
And then came bitcoin. 
What HTML did to press, YouTube to tv, and wikipedia to encyclopedias - bitcoin will do to digital money. I see it as a breakthrough bigger than the Internet itself.

The difference between those and the Internet/bitcoin examples, is that those are all products and services, while bitcoin and the Internet are not. They are protocols. Standards. A new kind of language. That's all. Bitcoin is just a language - and one that has many uses, so we see it being adopted exponentially. It's much harder to find an example of a decentralized, uncommercial language (standard protocol) that gained such impressive traction and ultimatly failed.
