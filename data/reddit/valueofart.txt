It is the concept of FOMO ����
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:22:23
The first transaction that was sent to the FUD &amp; FOMO address is confirmed on Block 514848.
The hash you can see below the QR-code is that transaction. Below that again you can see the to/from and amount included in that hash. Very small text so hard to see. I can upload some detailed images later :)

Thanks :)
This t-shirt is part of my art project and this block was chosen since it includes the first transaction onto the account associated with the two sculptures FUD &amp; FOMO :)
I have tried to explain the project on my webpage

Hi, this is an art project exploring the concept Value of Art. This is not charity. 
FUD &amp; FOMO (the two sculptures) will hopefully (must pass 2. jury in august first) be exchibited on the 131th annual National Art Exhibition in Norway this fall. They will be for sale at that exhibition.
The concept is: if the owner of one of the sculptures values the amount in bitcoin more than the sculptures value as art, then that owner have the choice to destroy the art piece and retrieve the bitcoins. Then the owner of the other sculpture «loses» his/hers bitcoins, but still has the piece of art.

Hi, the QR-code is the public bitcoin address which is the same as the donation address. The same public address is also engraved in characters, but so small it is not possible to read from the image.
The private key, necessary to withdraw the money, is hidden inside the sculpture between the glass and tungsten cube. It is also covered in a two hundred NOK bill to make it hard to fake. Norway just released new bills with several elements making them hard to fake.
The address only has 0.2 BTC, these I have put in myself. The only way to retrieve the 0.2 BTC is by destroying one of the two sculptures :)

On the topside of FUD &amp; FOMO the transaction hash for a transaction sending 0.1 BTC to the address is laser engraved. It is very small letters, so not easy to see on the photo.

Ufortunately my low order quantity combined with the genral high manufacture price for designs covering the whole t-shirt, taxes and shipping cost sums up to be a quite high cost per t-shirt. That is why the price is higher compared to other regular design t-shirt.
It is an unique and high quality t-shirt with a purpose of  increasing the monetary value of FUD &amp; FOMO. It would be great if I could have achieved this with a lower sales price, but for now I am not able to do that :(
Any tips on manufacturers that dropship custom made full cover design t-shirts world wide is appreciated. Then maybe I can get the sales price down ����

Are you sure about that? Feel free to write the key you see in a comment on this post.
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:49:10
I agree, shouldn’t trust the 300 years claim. I will make sure that the side printed with the key symbol is visible. So if that starts to fade away, then it is time to crack open the piggy bank :)
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:41:47
Yes, it will be as soon as they are encapsuled :) Is that a bad idea?
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:22:42
I got a better deal with my manufacturer and reduced shipping cost, thus a new price on the t-shirt now :)
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:47:38
I think maybe you mean the public keys that are engraved on each of the cubes? :)
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:46:10
Thanks. The cubes are made of tungsten which have same density as gold :)

I did enjoy that scene. Had not seen it before and your comment was a good one. My reply wasn’t serious. Just tried a «oh, no he/she knows what I did, act as he/she exagerate»
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:30:39
Ok, each of the contribution pieces are made of tungsten: [Video of the tungsten cubes]( 
They are laser engraved: [Laser engraving in process](

I admire how internet is full of good guys ;-)
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:32:32
Wow, don’t read too much out of my last sentence.  ��
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:54:56
Yeah, thanks for the warning, you never know. I did disconnected the printer and computer from internet and connected using usb. The printer will not be owned by someone else.
@_date: 2018-07-11 10:58:44
No, I connected using usb.
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:00:16
What about laser engraving them onto tungsten? Only problem is that I must rely on a third party to stamp or engrave...
