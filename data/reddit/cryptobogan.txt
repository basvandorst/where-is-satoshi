I started managing my own personal retirement money in mid 2017 but was not sure how the government would react to me using all of my retirement savings to buy BTC, if it was legal or not? I found the only company I could in Australia that specialised in letting you use your retirment fund to buy BTC and paid them 5% bloody commission,. 5.. bloody %!

It is brilliant but very long and slow, kids now days do not have enough of an attention span. lol

They probably do what all 0 fee payment providers do, buy/sell the BTC at 5%+ mark up and skim the rest. It should aveage out if they are making that % on every sale. Most trasactions would be far more that $2. Thats my guess anyway.

Just dollar cost average, buy as many sats as you can each month and forget about the price. buy dip, blah blah blah. do you think our kids will care if we paid 5k or 20k by the time they inherit. They will just be the new 1%. Never sell, just spend when you decide you have enough to retire, it will be accepted everywhere by then, won't even have to worry about fiat conversion rate.

govt are accountable, usually. they are hardly ever early adopters. We had 2 senators in Aus from different parties petition the Reserve bank to stack sats, as well as gold, last year for our reserves but it went no where. When less than 1% of the world pop owns bitcoin it is hard for democratic representatives to make the case a country's govt should.

dude, its nothing, 5k? Not sure about UK but in Aus you dont need to declare as your social media accounts or any business that you earn under 10k per year from can be classed as a hobby. Might be worth looking up. You don't have any capital gains issues if you sell right away. Don't know why you would want to swap BTC for fiat though, thats just weird????

Looks like I have to completely rethink one of my favourite drunken debate topics. Thanks for the clarification but you have put a big damenper on my next night out.

I found a 1764 northumberland shilling once. sold it for $645 on ebay. only cost $80 per 10 kilo of world coins. sold the rest at $8 per 500 grams, plus all the 100+ year old coins I found and got on average $2 each for. Had fun, made a great profit and my car is dirty as f\*

Quantumly speaking, reality is confirmed only when it is observed by a consiousness, before then, it is simply a possibility. If bitcoin is immutable, then I guess that is the same thing. Each block mined creates the only real money in existence, all other forms are still simply possibilities. The universe renders with observation, perhaps blockchain is the very first non-human/non-consiousness that can collapse that possibility into reality? If so Bitcoin is as much God as any other sentient entity as far as the creation of reality goes.
