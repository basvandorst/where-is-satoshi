a year ago? A year ago, mtgox was still the only exchange with some volume so you didn't had a lot of choice if you had a reasonable amount of bitcoins.

I always use a water mark with something like "only for verification purposes at mtgox.com", but yeah they stilll have my id number etc

I signed mtgoxrecovery.com, that's it. Personally though, I don't really see the reason for suing a bankrupt company. It costs a lot of money and in the end you still won't see anything back.

some mtgox investor is trying to buy 750k coins to bail out mtgox

yes, you can't censor reality. This will haunt bitcoin for a very long time and if bitcoin becomes really big in the future, it will be in all history books whether r/bitcoin likes it or not.

if they just open again, no new bitcoin or money will flow in, because who's gonna send it to an exchange that is on fractional reserve

I lost 148 bitcoin, it's a pity, especially because I'm just a college student. I used gox to trade a little bit, not really active though. I prefered gox because they had the best order books, you could easily sell 100 btc without moving the price a lot. I knew fiat withdrawals had a lot of delay, but I wasn't really concerned about that since it wasn't my goal to cash out and the issue seemed to be credibly explained by banking problems due to the novelty of bitcoin.
