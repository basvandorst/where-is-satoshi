Wow... Just wow. You basically described to the letter my day yesterday. I also thought I would be smart and game the system. Also sold and rebought just to lose like 0.05 BTC. And I learned the exact same lesson. Trading and gambling are just not for me haha

Debit card transfer fee is 3.99% and Bank transfer is 1.49%. Depends whether you want to short it OR HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:47:21
With an extra coinbase fee of 1.49% (if Bank transfer) or 3.99%if debit card in the US.

They add a fee so the price you buy for is more than the current market price and the price you sell for is less than the market price. So if you turned around and sold that you would probably have sold it for 9990 or something. It's the price you pay for the convenience

What was the price and time on your friend's receipt? There were a lot. Of fluctuations at the time so maybe that could have been a factor? I am just spit balling here as I don't really know the algo. Did you two buy the same amount? Out of curiosity, what were the amounts? If you are not comfortable sharing that's fine. They do have minimum fees which could have caused the disparity as well.

The fluctuations in price are driving me insane. They are changing by the second. Everytime I refresh Bitcoin checker it changes
