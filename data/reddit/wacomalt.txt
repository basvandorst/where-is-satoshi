Why wait? Its already here. Standard Bitcoin app and coinbase  app already support NFC, and mycelium will hopefully add my pull request soon too. Buy some tags and go to town!

If I stuck it to my phone, my phone would constantly be trying to initiate payments to myself. NFC lets someone else tap their phone to send Bitcoin, just like if they had clicked a Bitcoin: link, or scanned the qr code. I only have the qr because not everyone has NFC.

Same here, I probably wouldn't have trusted it if I had seen the video first.
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:46:08
Well, in many cases it is much easier. For example getting set up with circle took me around 10 minutes. So I'm hopeful.
I'm in no way trying to say that's always the case, especially depending on the amount of research you'd choose to do first, and which of the many ways to proceed there are. Bitcoin core for example takes like 2 days to sync now. So it remains to be seen, based entirely on what people's choice in methods is.
Of course, circle or similar require you to have a bank or card already to purchase, so there's always that. Comparable to a minimum opening balance in a bank I guess...
But I do think once you understand the system, the ease of use becomes evident.

Join me in what I'm doing tomorrow. Buy ad space in a local newspaper, aimed at business owners, advertising coinmap.com, and maybe coinbase and other merchant services available to them.  When I finish making my graphics I plan to share them on this sub so others can benefit and maybe convince some local companies.  I am with you. My local town (Dayton OH) has nothing, at all.
Originally I was tempted to maliciously add businesses to coinmap that dont support bitcoin, just so they may get customers coming in asking to pay with it :p but I figure advertising is less malicious.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:58:18
It should have sent you a PM. If it did not, I can see if I can cancel the tip and just send to the address you posted.  I'm serious. I benefited from the community by recovering my coins, I want to help those who have been less fortunate, especially if you're trying to actually conduct business with them.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:43:48
I've decided I'm going to create an ad for Coinmap, aimed at local businesses, and pay to place it in my local newspaper. When I do so I'll share the files, so you all can edit or use it yourself. I think advertising to potential bitcoin businesses, about what options there are, and the benefits, could help bring a few more places onboard.

I think the downvoting came from assuming we hate differing viewpoints and preempting that hate by assuming you'd get down voted. Though actually you're currently at 1 point.
Anyways, I'm not a fan of it either, but I get what they were going for. The two parts are corner view outlines of blocks. Assembled in a chain link. Thus, block &gt; chain. Its a good approach, but I don't like it for whatever reason. Just feels very generic.
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:16:33
I'm still completely OK with a one million DPI copy being uploaded if it were to happen. But if all we can get is some half res thing, that's ok.
I still don't see the risk as being enough to care.  Realistically those who would fall for this is a tiny subset of even the Bitcoin community.
There are gigapixel scans of Picasso online freely available. Also plenty of lesser known art that you may actually be able to fool someone with.  I'd happily pay for a knockoff of this newspaper. And given that the originals were mass media, I see no reason to prevent knockoff reproductions.
Only on reddit would you find people legitimately worried about the poor "masses" who will fall for a fake, of an incredibly niche item, of a very niche community.  So, at most maybe 5 very gullible people.
Its just not worth the worry and hoarding/secrecy. The real ones will always be worth a ton (provided people keep caring) and the fakes will be outed as thus.
Edit: Sorry.. I just realized I wall-of-text-ed
tl;dr:  Its a tiny risk. Mass media is fine to reproduce. Originals will keep value, reproductions won't. Meh.

What did you do with it? To my understanding they may have had some things implemented, but reading a tag with a bitcoin: URI link did not work. 
I know the AndroidManifest.xml file didnt have any NFC stuff active and that is the file that dictates what can invoke actions from the app. Nor did the app request permissions for NFC control. It's possible they had or have something implemented, but bitcoin: URI tags certainly weren't there when I added my commit.

That's a good point. I'm still pretty new and never thought to guess at a fundamental worth. I imagine people's estimates on that vary as widely as any though.  What's your guess based on?

Ah, nope :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:11:46
What would you want from a product like this? NFC tags are already readily available. Creating yet another CC processing service and scanner seems a waste.  Bitcoin wallet and coinbase already support NFC tags with the Bitcoin URI.  You can get a pack of them for $10 or so and add them to your square reader, a trezor, your store's checkout counter etc etc. Go to town! No need to wait for a new device :)
I just chose the square reader so I could have all payment options I support in a single device. Maybe stick it on a PayPal card reader if you really want an abomination XD.

The Schildbach wallet supported it first. I actually helped add it to Mycelium 5 or so months ago. The NFC setup is the exact same URI that QR codes or links use, just had to add an intent for receiving that over NFC.
I'm not sure what all is different with bitpay's approach, but good to see NFC Bitcoin uses expanding.
Edit: seriously easy to add if the URI is already supported by the app. Here's my commits to mycelium if anyone wants to do the same: 
Sorry there's so many separate commits. This was my first contribution on github ever.
Oh, and I don't think this supports phone to phone yet, but one way to find out.
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:57:08
I haven't seen those posts, but I'm not on here frequently. Every business near me that accepts them has not only taken them, but thanked me for paying with them. I've even had an owner from an online store email me personally and thank me for paying in bitcoin.
I'm sure people have dropped out, but I can't imagine it puts a dent in the number who are happy they adopted it.
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:46:20
Can you try this now? I did see some old commented out code, but nothing used it. Its possible they had something before which was removed? It didn't work for me which prompted me to add it, and the devs implied it was indeed a new addition. I don't think my change has been added yet so if you tried now on the current play store app it could confirm. 
Do you know if the tag had a bitcoin:123456 style URI on it or maybe it was some other format. All I added that was missing was that URI working from static NFC tags.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:09:19
Yes, I hope it gets addressed by the Dev, or at least tracked down and submitted as a bug so someone else can fix it.
What other people said about deterministic wallets is a good answer. You can never be at loss for a specific private key again. I recommend armory personally, but it does require synching the chain.

@_date: 2014-05-14 20:28:03
Thanks but I can't help but feel you are overestimating the usefulness of this. Its exactly the same as a QR code with an address on it, only you tap instead of scanning. It in no way does anything unique. The only thing special here is that its stuck to my Square card reader. You can make this exact thing for $10 or less. (Square card reader is free, NFC tags are super cheap) and then I just stuck the qr code on there too for people with no NFC in their phones.

People use USD because it makes sense and happens to actually abbreviate the name of the currency. If Bitcoin were actually called XtremeBits or something, then wed all be happy to use XBT to reference it. XBT doesn't make sense for anything other than a standards code.  No one using USD cares that it is standards compliant, and no layman cares about the standards (very few anyways).  They care that it makes sense in layman-speak, and is easy to remember.
BTC = BiTCoin.
USD = US Dollar&amp;.
XBT = Xylophone-BiTcorn? 
Again, for standards that's fine. It serves the purpose of being exact and compliant. But for any layman, I really don't see it catching on outside of that. What does it offer to the layman over BTC?
Sorry for so much back and forth over 3 letters. I wish you plenty of BTC  ;)

Lots of people missing my last sentence...
I guess my question was a bit too exaggerated.
I guess a better question, is given that smaller "crisis" scenarios can and will happen. What ways can we better prepare to have a better chance of still being able to spend money?
Id like to think, perhaps far to optimistically, that during an internet blackout in my city, that cash would at least temporarily maintain value.  Yeah my bank wouldn't work, yeah, paypal and apple pay and all that would be dead too.
Is there any way to manually, like pen and paper, or at least without internet, to do a bitcoin transaction, and later broadcast it (should internet become available)?  I think these issues probably also effect developing countries trying to adopt.

Nope, armory is GUI, but can be run in command line I think. Do some research, view some videos. It has a great offline mode for added security if you have an extra machine at home to use as a forever offline "vault".
It can be a bit more complicated but well worth the security. Definitely educate yourself before you decide though ;)

@_date: 2014-11-22 04:50:53
In truth, the average beginner to Bitcoin is probably starting on Coinbase, Circle, or something similar.  I think the key factor here is that to an average person on the street, a checking account "seems" easier. There's 5 banks near them, and they don't have to set up or maintain their own money storage. Just hand over info and money, in a perceived-as-normal setup process, and start using.
To many people I bet setting up Bitcoin sounds akin to setting up a storage vault and storing stocks and bonds in it. Is that accurate? In some ways yes, some no. But the public really only cares about what **sounds** easy, what is the norm, and what works.  Bitcoin hits on only one of those, that it works (very well, but that doesn't matter so much for initial adoption rate).
Banks **sound** easy, even if they often arent. Banks are sadly the norm. And banks do indeed work (how well varies, but they do work).
There's sadly not enough "killer applications" for the tech, at least not in the eye of Joe Schmoe.
So if it is going to catch on, it will be relatively slowly compared to some other tech adoptions. But I'm fine with that. I do think after some amount of adoption it will hit a fever pitch though. Here's hoping.

I think you did the right thing. You took a item that to 99.99999991% of the population is worth exactly the $1 or whatever it was originally sold for, and managed to raise money for something important. In no way shape or form do I think you releasing this image harmed anyone.  In fact I'm willing to bet that even if you uploaded a 1200DPI copy, that the number of people who would get scammed are less than 5 if we're being generous.
Actually, I'd happily buy a well made copy, even knowing it was a fake.  It's like people buying a fine print of an art piece. 
Collectors will know how to spot a fake, people who want a decent reproduction could get one for a decent price, and the value of the originals would change probably not at all.  I fail to see a downside here.  Everyone happy.
This is especially silly considering we don't even know which edition of this times he would have had, or even if it would have been a physical copy.  As with everything about Satoshi, it's mostly just a mystery, a very fun mystery.
I cant help but feel anyone angered by sharing this image must have been planning on making a quick buck off of their own scans.
tl;dr Thanks for uploading an image. Don't for a moment feel like you screwed someone over. you didn't, and in the way you proceeded you actually helped people. Thanks for being awesome.

The question is not "does the Bitcoin community as a whole want lobbyists?" Its "How do those of us who want to, submit funds, and who could head the action?"  
Dogecar took a 16 year old with a plan. What does it take for 5 lobbyists? Who's gonna appropriate the funds and oversee them getting to the right place?
My idea is we start an open call for lobbyists who would want the task, and we vote with our BTC (in escrow) the top 5 get the funds and the amount pledged to lobbyists who didn't make it gets split evenly among the winners.
Or... Something like that.  That makes it possible for each lobbyist to directly receive funds, and exchange for cash, if desired.
Thoghts?   This way all we need is a page with addresses of anyone who has applied, maybe bios and links to their lobbying history, and display the current balance of their addresses for the current standings.

I got in early and was told I got in on the "first wave".  I was also quoted over the phone when I ordered an estimate of " early February".  Came and went. Finally got the email saying I'd have an option to either refund, or get a free upgrade. The next email told me that neither of those options applied to me and my only option is a coupon on another 300gh miner.   I demanded they hold up their original options of refund or free upgrade. That was a week ago. No word back.

And fiat is so dependent on internet currently it would probably crash (or some sort of chaos) before banks could transition back to an internet free system. They worked back then because its all we had back then. It wouldn't work now, at least not without some major failing and chaos during the switch.

Maybe he could do the re-write, but specifically list examples of ponzi schemes, and how Bitcoin is not one, and how it helps to prevent that sort of thing.

Mentioning people doing Bitcoin bodymods in the OP is really alienating. Yes some will do it, but I think the takeaway here is that a tap on anything can start payments, and at no risk to you.  The hand implant idea (or is this already done?) Is for the truly "passionate" (or obsessed?), but more power to you I guess.
Sorry I was just surprised and weirded out that this genuinely useful change sparked so many conversations about fringe body-modding. I guess it'd be useful, but I doubt many would do it for the 2 added seconds of convenience.
On the important topic here, NFC BIP38 private key storage is a great idea and I'm glad to see it implemented! Does the URI support for the secured private keys extend back onto QR reading too? So any qr app would see to open mycelium, and mycelium would handle the URI correctly with it?
Lastly, is this out for beta folks yet? Itching to try it!
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:50:20
That really really sucks. I almost lost all my coins 2 years ago, unrelated trouble, but I know that sickening feeling. Have $25 back @_date: 2014-04-18 17:52:13
I get what you are saying. It can never be "official" on legal stuff, but BTC is blatantly more used, thus it is the actual accepted abbreviation, standards compliant or not. You don't see people saying "it costs 1 XBT"  or "200 mXBT please"
Some exchanges, or other places that care about standards compliance will use XBT, no one else will because its not an abbreviation, its a code. USD has the benefit of being both. If USD were forced to be called UTN or something (U for United States country code, TN for treasury note or something) no one would actually use it. 
Just trying to say people will use, adopt, and brand, based on what is accepted and useful, not based on what is standards compliant.
BTC will continue to be the recognized abbreviation by pretty much everyone, XBT will exist only where it has to. Correct or not.

If past trends are no guarantee (to that I agree), then neither is the shorter term trend since December. prolixus's question, and your answer are kinda moot in that regard.
Regardless, trends DO happen. Never a guarantee, but if we're having to guess I'd guess off of the longest and most continual trend, which is all this chart is trying to show. I think going on a 4 month trend, compared to a 2 year trend is a little silly, even if neither is to be considered more true. 
Just saying we all use patterns, they serve their purpose, sometimes.

Yeah, rural southern Ohio. The closest Bitcoin company is about 45 minutes away. I'm betting no.

I'd bet that too honestly. Kinda kills the sexiness of having something like this, but at the very least it still helps put you in the time.

To me this is the absolute best Bitcoins news I have ever seen. Major win!
I'm so happy!
Edit: Its not in the android app yet. I just ordered a 4TB drive on desktop though. Went smooth so far.

I didn't expect to watch the whole thing. Truly informative and the absolute best thing for a committee tasked with advising on regulation to hear. I love that they legitimately were interested, asked good questions, and seemed willing to actually think objectively.
More of that sort of reaction is needed from would-be legislators.

I was told about a month ago (by a friend, who talked to someone named Dave in BFL shipping, apparently) that they have 3 waves coming. 1st is employee and friends/family wave. Next is 1st preorder wave, then 2nd preorder wave.
This same guy also told him I made it into the 1st preorder wave, which would go out early march at the latest.
Take this all with a spoonful of skepticism. I can't vouch for his contact, nor do I know how he got his contact info.
Obviously that first family wave will last for exactly long enough to stop any later waves from being profitable. Learned my lesson.

Yeah we should totally prevent anyone from ever seeing this awesome historical marker, because some assholes may be assholes with it.
Yup, better take down any scans of rare art prints too.
The benefit is far greater than the danger here. Anyone seriously searching for a real copy will be scrutinizing enough and have pros to spot a fake.  If not, well... a fool and their money..  Let us peasants have our low res jpegs for posters and stuff, the risk is remarkably low.

I've never not put www. I legitimately didn't know it worked without it. I'm 26 and have been using the internet since I was 7. I feel stupid.
I should check my site to see if it works there too. Is this expected on every website nowadays?

True, that's a way worse video.  (well, it's funny I guess, but its super not trustworthy looking, like the app is.)

@_date: 2014-09-30 01:14:59
Sorry that was unclear. There ARE limits to the amount you can transact which change over time as you gain their trust. The lack of limits I referred to is as far as the TYPE of cards you use. CoinBase only works with VISA, Circle seems to work with VISA and MasterCard (Varying success depending on your country but most people have had luck) there's a thread somewhere listing all the tried cards thus far and it looks promising.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:04:06
Yeah I think my change tip didn't go because I literally just deposited to it, so it hadn't confirmed. I just sent via normal transaction, good luck!
6b57a13469e340a53afeee8ad36dcc8a6e68686e63cd5fc62c447e4df3f6a9a1 is the transaction for that.
Edit: If the changetip ever does go through, feel free to keep that as well.

Google now is on computers? How do I see cards?

That's true, it really does scale badly. The icon for their android apps is not good at that size.

Yes but no. To my knowledge the API isn't out yet. Google chose 30 companies to work with for it and coinbase is one of them.

Very cool, but man... would have a field day with some of the images on the main page.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:39:26
I agree with you, I think, but to argue a point, if you only accept movement after its 100% proven that it's a good direction, no one ever moves.  If we had to refine every technology for a full lifetime before we deemed it safe for market, we wouldn't have much technological advancement.  I know this isn't what your saying exactly, but there's similarities. Sometimes you have to look at a bunch of possibilities and hope you pick the right one based on prediction, because you can't really know. At least not before you drown in the challenges that put you at this decision in the first place.
(To cover my ass, I'm tired and on sleep meds right now, sorry if this is a junk comment...)
@_date: 2014-09-10 04:18:46
Gotcha. Well hopefully we could at least keep some generator power or solar chargers going to do offline stuff.  I've had an interest in some of the mes0-hnet projects like cjdns and whatnot in the past, kinda want to see how those have matured, if at all.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:20:58
Guilty until proven innocent, eh?
Untested could be a valid concern, declaring it buggy without evidence is not valid.

I don't have much any more, but made a credit card sized laminated plastic card with my BIP38 encrypted private key on one side and public on the other side both in text and QR. Also have a NFC tag laminated into it so I can tap it on any phone to initiate payment.
Never find anyone to use the NFC though but I even added the NFC support to mycelium just so I could do this.
As a follow up question.. is BIP38 still considered safe?
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:27:26
Not sure if this is a stupid question or not, but does what software I'm using now have any effect on the perceived consensus? Does my client have to be special to work with btcc vs btc? From a user standpoint do I need to change my behavior to avoid issues and to voice my opinion?
I use a paper Wallet and mycelium, am I good for BTCC if it happens (is it already a thing? So lost here...)
I've been away for awhile and am just a long term holder. The Bitcoin community all needs to do a better job of explaining(Like we're 5) the choices at hand, in visible places.
This may also be stupid, but is there or could there ever be a BIP that adds a straight up voting from a user level? Maybe weighted by number of coins on the voting address?
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:05:34
There wasn't an area code, so I just sent it to every possibility.

Not saying its not lame, but it sounds like a valid reason. We need to film our own.

I went the route of a convenient paper wallet. I laminated a card with my BIP38 encrypted private key and my public address. I use Mycelium to scan that when I need to spend. I can even do all this offline and then enable connection once I'm done. The private key is not stored on Mycelium.
Yes, this means the phone could be compromised but I only keep a percentage this way. The tradeoffs have been ok so far.
I also completely replace this wallet every few months.
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:05:31
Yes but that's the tradeoffs of having an actual easy to use card. I suppose I could create something with a HD wallet seed? Open to suggestions.

It's not because you're on a Pixel. It's your Reddit app. Which are you using?
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:49:52
Identification only gets attached to addresses if you allow it to be. Anonymity is not the goal of Bitcoin, but it is possible to use it anonymously with some focused effort. Far better choices if that's your goal though. Ex:  Monero, Darkcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:46:06
Dozens? Neat! That's a fantastic rate!  Probably pulled the number out your ass, but even at 20x that it'd still be a great fraud rate.
How many Instances of stolen USD has had the same nil result? (Hint: its definitely more than 12... By millions I'd bet)

Plenty of cases where this works great.

Do I still need to manually signal for Segwit if I'm running this version?  I compiled my own from the UASF branch but I haven't removed my -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148 argument from my shortcut.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:31:29
Can you edit this to point to the newest source code? This comment is still top results in google for trying to do this.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:37:45
Sorry I'm confused what is the news here? I see nothing in the changelog pertaining to UASF, did you mean to link to a tweet or something?

Seeing this just made me set up another full node.

My nice mobile solution is a BIP encrypted paper wallet card. I store the public key Only in mycelium app and scan the card if I want to spend. Coupled with a VERY long password and I feel safe enough.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:34:32
If it's in the startup line it should be good. Sorry but I don't know how to check with ipv6
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:16:11
you need to launch bitcoin with the -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148 command line argument. You cannot type a command into a running bitcoin instance to do this, it has to launch with it.  The same command, minus the -, can be added to your bitcoin.conf file as an alternative.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:19:39
Make sure your node is fully visible and signalling correctly here  You can use your IP a little down the page to check. You should see something like this: 
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:08:04
If you can get your private keys, you could create a 2nd transaction with the same inputs and a much higher fee to get validated first.
I did this last night to a transaction that was stuck for 24h with 328sat/B fee. I upped it to 420sat/B on the Double spend and that went through.. after 12 more hours.
EDIT: Here's a guide on how you can do this in electrum, if you can get ahold of your private key.    (disregard the steemit in the URL, it is a bitcoin guide)  
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:06:35
Wow, I've been in Bitcoin since the $7 days and I've never heard the term coinbase meaning anything but the company.  You're right, but so is he saying it's obscure enough that it's not stepping on the toes of the technical term (for the average user anyways)
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:31:42
Is it more effective to run a node on the forked software or is just signaling equally as good at the present situation?  
I learned how to build from source just to make my own Windows binaries but just wondering if that makes a difference right now. At the very least I'm signaling on both of my full nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:51:27
Ah, thanks for explaining

I had a situation with a bunch of BTC I'd bought at $15. Wound up forgetting about it, wiped the drive for a new OS.  Year(s?) later at the MtGox bubble i managed to recover them with some python program that scanned the drive sector by sector. I guess thankfully that process of the drive hadn't been touched.
Lived on those coins for the next 4 months :)
Now I sadly have no cryptos at all :( times are tough

The rule "only invest what you can afford to lose" still applies. Sadly at the time, the amount I could afford to lose was $0.
I don't regret it regardless. Still a massive win from a $250 investment.  Also living on Bitcoin only solidified my belief in the tech and made living frugally a less miserable challenge.
