Christmas Day happened and lots of people got miners from others. Prob a good thing as more people are starting that learning curve.

best community!

maybe more of you who would burn tips anyways, throw some more at them?
theyre HOT 89.9 hosts, you can check their handles, im not trying to scam tips to me.
mine is  and you can see my tips there too
Im sure they'd definitely talk more about it if they got a bunch of tips, as would be the case for any rasio hosts or people like that in general
just a little experiment, hoping it goes well

fantastic work. merchants being able to accept it without another 'cost' will help adoption for sure!

Same things I learned. How bitcoin works and how the network does its thing. I had no idea what I was doing and got an 8GH BFL and figured out as I went. I've learned a ton from mining and as a free donation, it gives kids an opportunity to tinker and learn. They're not going to make anything substantial but giving kids stuff to use facilitates learning. If one kid takes anything from it, I feel it's more worthwhile than tossing it or selling it for paper weight.

i donated an old s1 and an s3 to my children's school for the computer lab, as well as a raspberry pi so they can mees around with them and get a love for crypto the same way i did, by tinkering.
Plan on going in one day soon to show the computer lab teacher how to work it and get it going.
Kids learning crypto and how it works it more valuable than what an ol unit can make or cost.
Do it!

you should have enough by now to put your bits in your own wallet. Read and ask about security here in and make sure you keep your bits safe. Not much yet but you'll start to appreciate their value the more you learn.
have an internet and enjoy @_date: 2015-01-15 02:32:23
Quebec is nice,eh?

Keep it going!

i know nothing about code but am working on a somewhat similar plan, something to make it easier for people in my local area to buy bitcoins easily and to help merchants accept it. More of a personal interaction approach than strictly online. this gives the opportunity to teach people important things in a hands on way. bitcoin is easy (in some ways haha) but intimidating for the new adopters. perhaps we can throw some ideas at each other.
Good luck and Good work!

For sure but there are many bright, 'nerdy' kids that soak tech up. Even at 10 they're sponges for knowledge. My 12 year old daughter grasps the concepts from seeing it actually happening and messing with stuff with me. 
Certainly not for the masses but for curious techsavvy children, bitcoin as a tech (more than as a currency) is a wonderful learning experience.

He/she is saying that it is a disruptive technology that is fearless enough to ride right on up to the bigger stronger currencies/stores of value we use and bite their scrotums violently. 
Bitcoin is doing this whilst giving no fucks, a la honey badger.

Semi related question:
How did the US govt manage to seize all of DPR's coins from SR? Was DPR not as careful with his PK's as he should have been or was he legally forced to give them up? Seems like in situations like that and the one in the article would be somewhat mitigated by storing value safely away from govt reach? I don't think we have such harsh forfeiture laws in Canada, but keeping value in places that cant be easily seized and with well made PK's should be a bit of a priority for even the most honest of citizens.

disgusting wealth inequality is not the best point to use when youre trying to back fiat. nice try though.

dont wanna hijack this post but i was wondering about the seed words and whether they can be used by someone to take control of a wallet?
for example, if i put random seed words into electrum to recover a wallet and actually hit a used combo, would i then be able to hijack the funds in that wallet? kinda worries me for my cold coins.

how about bullshit recurring credit card payments? like the one i have on my CC and have to argue with the company to stop charging?
they have my CC data and keep dipping in and succeed unless I continually detect it and stop it.
thats a fucking problem, bud.

someone figure out this math question please.
