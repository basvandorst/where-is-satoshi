Me and a friend of mine were working on a Bitcoin alternative to eBay, but we stopped since school takes up so much time... It was supposed to be called BitPlank, basically adding a product to the site would cost a small fee to mostly cover for the costs of running the website. We had all the design and some basic fundementals of a website, but then we just stopped. It was supposed to be very easy to use. Instead of paying the full amount for the product to the website, you pay directly to the reseller, so it was like a meetup for buyers and sellers. The reliability was supposed to be built upon reviews and ratings, like eBay. Maybe we should take up the project again, if there is any interest..

haha, true, but I believe you can build trust,  is a betting and trade site with similar function, although they don't have the escrow thing.

Interesting, have not seen that before. But I believe some kind of central website would make it very quick and convenient.

Can you still buy from Mt.Gox? I know it is not good for Bitcoin but since I am a late discoverer (and a poor student) I believe it is a great opportunity to get some Bitcoins!

Oh yeah, sorry, missed that. My fault!

Depends on which courses you choose! I read economics in High school right now :)

I believe he compared Klarna with PayPal, not Bitcoins.

Good luck to your son! No I am not, haha, but I am from the country that invented it(at least I believe so?) Sweden! Very many people "snusar" (swedish verb for using snus) here, mostly guys. The name is actually from a character in a children's book called "The Moomins". Just a random name I picked a while ago!

 Is that the one?
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:43:50
Some kind of source, but like the other guys said, I read it here...
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:25:16
Thank you!

Would buy one if I lived in the US! Love young entrepreneurs fulfilling their ideas! He is going to be a very successful man in the future.

Quick question, very off topic. I have an old Mac Mini from 2009 standing in my shelf collecting dust, would it be worth it to run it as a miner? Would I get any profit at all?

Well, banning all bitcoin-transaction apps is quite anti-bitcoin....

The amount of stupidness must be off the chart, haha

Can someone link a statement or an article from Apple stating what the topic is referring to?
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:33:43
You sir, gave me an idea, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:07:27
Maybe thats the case, I am going to do some research before I buy one :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:06:47
Hahaha,

I've been using iPhone for approx. 4-5 years now, been liking it back and forth. But when they go "anti-bitcoin" I can not stand it any more. When I've paid the last month of my iPhone, I am going Android, probably GS5 when it is coming out.
