They didn't want centralization so they're going with the arguably even more centralized Lightning Network ?

This just confirms in my mind that Satoshi is dead. He wouldn't have allowed core to kill BTC like it's doing.

Nothing, bloodyfinger. Nothing.
Well, I take it back you still need it to buy alts with on most exchanges. Once that goes...

The reason it's being politicized is because some insiders are making money out of BTC being broken, and it's more helpful to them if the discussion is kept in the emotional realm instead of the rational pragmatic one. Otherwise it'd be an easy decision (increase the block size!)

You're going to let BTC die rather than admit you were wrong?

This sounds like it breaks Bitcoin.

I remember when this sub used to celebrate and get excited every new business that accepted bitcoin. BTC is being dropped by many businesses because it's just unpractical.

Can't speak for why /btc hates /bitcoin, but I see no good rational reason for this sub to hate on /btc so much. Seems all emotional tribal arguments. I get that BCH is hated because it's perceived as a centralized 'coup' attempt by Roger Ver and miners, but they objectively have a product that is addressing a need that's not met in the current BTC system. Don't insult your competition, outcompete them.

It's BCC on bittrex.

Being solely a 'store of value' is also a deviation from BTC's original purpose.
Whatever, enjoy your useless coin. Watch its price go up and down while you do nothing productive with it.

When is that going online?

Price was pushed to those highs by speculators - not adoption. It's a useless coin other than for hoarding or speculating. Nobody uses BTC.

The amount of transactions that can be processed at one time are limited by the block size, currently at 1 megabytes for regular Bitcoin. This leads to users outbidding each other in order to get miners to process their transaction in the next block (or even in a timely manner). Bitcoin Cash solves this (temporarily at least) by increasing the size of each block to 8 MB (= more room for transactions).

You've obviously never had to move significant savings in crypto. Those 20 minutes where it's not in your wallet or when something fucks up and it disappears for hours or days until you can sort it out are unacceptable.

The Bitcoin 'core' group of developers argued against an increase in block size. Much FUD ensued. Another group, led by Roger Ver, decided to fork in order to increase the block size anyway. Much drama (still) ensues.
This whole mess would have been avoided if BTC core would have increased the block size in a timely manner, even if it was only a temp band-aid while other things like Lightning Network come online to help congestion / transaction costs. Now the original Bitcoin is a broken coin used by rich people that don't mind paying absurd transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:33:35
Not sure about that.

hitBTC is a scam exchange - they confiscate coins regularly. Why are you promoting them?

Actually, I just had a transaction in GDAX where I withdrew BCH and the funds were lost in the ether, never got to their destination. Thankfully, I was able to resolve it, but it was a stressful couple of days and only resolved because GDAX acted in good faith when I pointed out their (technical) mistakes. If something had gone wrong and GDAX would not have acted in good faith, I would have had little recourse except to hire an expensive lawyer and prove to an un-tech savy court how I was wronged. 
[There's plenty of stories of people losing their funds due to something in the process going wrong.]( Some times it's some form of user error, sometimes it's the tech - we shouldn't ignore either. This isn't 'tragic', but concerning. There's little accountability in the crypto space so those 20 minutes wondering if you or the tech screwed up a significant transfer is justifiably scary. It's something that needs to be improved if any crypto aims to replace something like Western Union.

Transaction costs. High BTC transaction fees make it impractical to use as a form of payment.

Buy ETH/LTC or, my fav, zcash with your bitcoins. Transfer those.
It'll be quicker &amp; cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:28:26
Wow! So glad I got all my coins out of that shithole.

Many people around 2008 paid high prices not because of a moral defect where they were trying to buy more than what they could afford, but because speculators had driven the price of a normal house (actually, all houses) to exorbitant levels. Even then they bought the house thinking they could make the payments, then the recession hit and they lost their job and the house, dick.

Actually no, I was confused. BTC withdrawals for Kraken are .001BTC flat, so about $6-7 total. Better to just withdraw the BTC than exchange it. Just use your GDAX BTC deposit address to withdraw the funds. They'll send you an email to confirm and you'll be set.
