I just keep my currency in lbs, so I’m still waiting for 10k.

This seems specifically caused by btrash though. Hence the massive drop in all 4 (with bcash dropping 80% from that 9500 high) 
Edit: Sorry, 60% crash from 4300.

Looking at the community and growth of understanding decentralized currency, I think bitcoin will continue to be the gold standard well into the future.

I always wonder if comments like this are serious or trolling? Like, do you not understand why storing value elsewhere is a threat to financial institutions and FiAT regardless of volatility? Continued growth shows continued adoption which would a possible future of high stability? I’m just confused by comments like these and the follow up comments of “yeah someone gets it!”

Bcash would like a word with you

My claim was that continued growth shows continued adoption.Increasing adoption means increasing price, I never claimed increasing price means increasing adoption. But in order for bit coins price to increase, people have to have purchased more bitcoin.

There are fewer owned bitcoin/ owners of bitcoin than 2 years ago?
