It seems that they do have some systems in place already. I'm not seeing the opportunity to provide value to Somalia through Bitcoin though, unless Bitcoin were adopted widely as a parallel currency and some serious thought were given to the dependence on a central blockchain and transaction pool.
It costs ~3% to transfer money to the parts of Somalia that aren't under siege.
Is Somalia really a good candidate for Bitcoin? For remittance or daily use?  
Here's an article I found on the subject..

Welcome to the hazing period! xD
Honestly, aside from the tech cred of waiting up to 48 hours and having a 1.2 gb copy of the block chain on your computer, there's no good reason to install the client to your desktop anymore. I'd strongly advise that newbies use one of the many existing web based wallets. If you're especially concerned with security, check out strongcoin.com - they don't keep a plaintext copy of your private keys, and require javascript on the client side to decrypt for sending bitcoin to others.

Because fraud protection for small business is an often forgotten component to healthy competition and viability in international and domestic markets.
When you pay for goods and services using plastic, both the merchant and the customer pay increased fees to offset the cost of fraud and loss.
Think of Bitcoin like cash or as a digital bearer bond. Perhaps your problem with understanding the benefits stems from a misinterpretation of Bitcoin as a replacement of the current payment systems (which it is not).
@_date: 2012-01-03 21:06:45
Any time you're taking cash and exchanging that for stored value above a certain limit on a regular basis, where a central bank account obscures the origin of the untraceable cash, and where a person or business is not keeping records or limiting suspect transactions that meet the guidelines established by finCEN and other regulatory frameworks in regards to KYC and AML compliance on a federal level, you are risking federal criminal charges and if arrested, you WILL be found guilty of structuring, money laundering or terrorist/drug financing (pick one).
Informal money transfer service = illegal money laundering under the law.
I'm not sure that the Federal Government is in the wrong, as finCEN is pretty straight forward and gives a rather straight forward compliance framework. Hawala and other informal money services are conduits for drug and criminal laundering.
As is, there's a few people in the Bitcoin community who have publicly admitted to structuring, de facto laundering and illegal money service businesses through their advertisement in forums, and unfortunately, their near complete dismissal of existing federal and state statutes (thinking it doesn't apply to them) will see some examples made in the coming months through criminal charges and ongoing investigations.
It's going to be an interesting year for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-02-09 09:45:03
Guess on a few strategies and back test them. The method which you use to buy and sell Bitcoin is as important, or more important than the strategy you employ to trade it for profit (ema/sma, RSI, your gut).
You have to plan ahead of emerging trends, and be able to act quickly. This usually means you should have your limit orders in ahead of the movement, rather than trying to make consistent earnings through market orders in a reactionary way.
It's sort of pointless to back test a strategy unless it takes the available historical depth / slippage into account, and factors in the longer term market climate.
Good luck.
@_date: 2012-04-19 17:49:48
Hey man, fair enough. I understand where you're coming from, but I come from the position of bitcoin being a frictionless method of micropayments and online cash without a central authority. In that way, we agree. Apparently we don't agree as it pertains to illegal activity, and frankly if you look at the other side of your argument, bitcoin given free reign can also be used for child sex trafficking, arms trafficking, drug trafficking and all other sorts of criminal activity.
If you really want Bitcoin to succeed, you have to recognize that to some extent, it's in and out-points are going to have to be regulated and monitored.
[edit] I'd also like to point out that your post history suggests that you fit into the SR element of Bitcoin, and that you might want to be sure to protect your IP address and identity when you're posting. Talking about LSD and recommending it to others is a sure fire way to find yourself in a database, and if you're really unlucky, in a federal prison.

Somalia isn't plagued by  such as tight skinny jeans right out of the dryer, but instead suffers from rampant disease, warlords, hunger and human rights abuses. 
Further, Somalis don't have computers or cell phones en masse to support Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin use would depend on somali money transmitters, and a reliable supply of somali shilling (33,300 SOS/USD), USD, Euro or Pound physical currency. In the end, those MSBs in and out of US jurisdiction still fall under the worldwide AML/KYC laws throughout the western world.
The effort required to bootstrap an alternative payment system in Somalia is too high.
Western Union is still an option for remittances from the US to Somalia. to send her mother in Somalia $600 from the USA would cost $18.50, 3%, still cheaper than what it would cost to use MtGox, Tradehill, Bank Transfers, etc.

It's not too surprising. My guess is that MtGox asked them if they'd be able to use the receiving account name / verified info at MtGox as the 3rd party verification of ID -- i.e. share the name and match ss# with Dwolla for verification of account and fraud control.
Dwolla doesn't want your Facebook linked so that they can spam your friends or snoop into your feed to find out about your weekend. They use Facebook for verification of identity along with 3rd party private and government databases. That's all.

I've asked many people why they bother to wait for confirmations on such low amounts. It's so incredibly unlikely for you to get scammed that it's really not worth the delay. Seriously, you should consider 0 confirmation.

Silk road distributors acting as middle men to bulk and consumers are the easiest targets. Completely exposed.
Further, Bitcoin is a honey trap in and of itself. Google, the block chain and any exchange that follows AML laws have enough data as a whole for any law enforcement agency to get a conviction.

Every time I see someone post the type of question like the one listed above, "Has TH's closure caused people to just sell and wash their hands of Bitcoin?", I immediately assume that they were snookered by their own greed into purchasing a few hundred/thousand bitcoin, be it at $7, 10$ or any number higher or lower than shown.
Speculation is part and parcel of the coming growth of Bitcoin, and I guess I'm just to the point where arguments and discussions about things like Tradhill shutting down, really makes me get disappointed in the bigger picture of the community a a whole. The closure of tradehill only effected Arbitragers, Bitinstant's bottom line, and Tradehill itself.
you see, the real problem is that we're all being watched by busy reporters for national press, and their job is to pick at the scabs that seem most evident, and then report on them as fact.
You come on Reddit and you make leading statements about the value of Bitcoin in relation to a po-dunk and meaningless exchange from Chile that has shut down (tradehill), that has apparently started a lawsuit with Dwolla over chargebacks that have caused a rift in the community even though Dwolla is still one of the largest in-exchange funding sources in existence in terms of Bitcoin.
i'd ask that you be smarter than to make a broad sweeping allegation or to pose a question that has no merit (such as Tradehill going out of business caused 25% of the drop in value). See, you're quite transparent (at least to me) in that you hold bitcoin at a loss right now, and have participated only because you thought you could make 10-25% on your money.
Bitcoin doesn't need your type of speculator. If you dumped all your money into Bitcoin, and you didn't hedge against loss, then you deserve to have your USD's eaten up by the decentralized and always active bitcoin exchange market. 
If you invest in Bitcoin for the purpose of "investment" then you're doing it completely WRONG, and I would really encourage you to take a few further steps to understanding what Bitcoin is really for.

This 0.50 - 2.00 per day is a gross figure, not taking added electric costs into consideration. 
Basically what this concept puts forth is that the game companies will use your GPU to mine for Bitcoin, the NewCo will pay the Game companies in USD/Fiat, you get worthless virtual items in game and your parents pay the additional 20-40$ per month in electricity.
0.5 / day is not the lower bound though.. The lower bound is more like 0.10 cents a day, and this is an incredibly strange thing to invest 500k into.
Best of luck.
Assumes 350 MH/s running 24/7 with 0.12 cent electricity (I'm being generous.. Check out tiered rates.. I feel bad for the parents..)
**3 Month Estimate**
**Power cost per time frame: 78.89 USD** ( 27/mo in electric cost )
Revenue per time frame: 95.39 USD
... less power costs: **16.50 USD**

MtGox is 90% of the market. Tradehill shutting down probably had an effect on the price, but not 25% worth.

All hostel owners care about is getting USD for stays in their facilities. Rather than go to an existing aggregation site to pitch the idea (they're not going to care), it would be far more ideal to create your own aggregation point and invite existing hostels (in big tech areas, for instance) to join. In this case then, you act as their payment gateway, you'd book reservations and take bitcoin as payment. Further, the bitcoin would be immediately converted to cash (or however, according to the hostel's wishes) and transferred to them on a weekly or biweekly basis.

NFC is the only way to accommodate this type of transaction for a large audience. NFC enabled phones are already coming down the pipe. In this case, a user would open their wallet, hold the phone within 4 inches of the vending machine receiver, would select their favorite vended item, their screen would pop up with a 'confirm $ purchase' button. On confirmation, bitcoin/visa/voucher/whatever sends confirmation to a payment gateway that authorizes the vending machine to dispense your selection. In the case of bitcoin, it would be possible in theory to transmit a preloaded keypair, but in practice this would be cumbersome. No matter how you slice it, a payment gateway would be needed. Also, doublespend is a non issue, but it's a perennial favorite of bitcoin newbies.

Bitcoin truly is the crossroads where techies are being forced to quickly learn about economic systems. Bitcoin has to have a trusted, steady and fungible value. In order for that value to be established over time, we in fact need *MORE* exchanges, 3rd party settlement (coming with the inclusion of BIP 0011). In order for Bitcoin to have value, it needs to have a reliable enough value that it doesn't always have to be converted to fiat. Imagine buying gold coins just so you could run to the store and purchase your groceries, receive your change in gold coins, and run to the gold shop for dollars in case of a price fluctuation.
The way to reliably scale Bitcoin is through real level II depth, better exchange platforms and reliable international alternative payment systems.
Imagine Bitcoin stable, and in common use online and among geeky friends, where the volume and depth gives only a gentle breeze on the charts, and where an ad hoc basket of currencies, backed by decentralized but interwoven exchanges, provide solid liquidity and price competition, while adopting a common set of protocols and methods for clearing and settlement, and aggregating market data.
