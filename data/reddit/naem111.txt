Also incorrect.
Some basic research will show you that those low class ASICS run on 2.5W of power. That equals one or two pennies a day in most of the U.S.
My initial numbers took electricity into account. They will profit after 60-90 days at bitcoin's current value including electricity.

This.  As price increases, the amount of people able to pay that price goes down.
Expecting lots of bigger investors with lots more money as price goes up is not realistic.

looks like someone did.

It's going up. I don't think we'll see your predicted decrease.

Your post is entirely premature. Come back after this supposed "major crash" and post... but you won't... because it's not going to happen.

Money laundering and terrorism most likely. Probably child trafficking too. Clearly.

Yes, people do it.
It is very risky.
Be careful.

The absolute lowest class of ASIC USB miner was (at one time) going for about $15.
At the current value of bitcoin, you will make profit with one of those after 60-90 days. That profit will only be increasing as the price of bitcoin goes up.
Is it any surprise that they sold out nearly instantly?

The predicted "big crash" never came... it must be so disheartening for them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:35:30
Not really... 'cause it's kinda been over it for a bit.

I just drilled a hole in my refrigerator door and ran the USB through there.

Personally, I think it's better to keep it as BTC rather than mBTC. Bigger numbers get people more excited.

That logic only sticks if bitcoin had stayed somewhere below $1,000.
As bitcoin continues to grow, it has become apparent that even someone with a low level ASIC USB miner can profit after a few months.
Why do you think it's impossible to get 330mh/s USB ASICs for $15 anymore?
