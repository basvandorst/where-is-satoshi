Not only that, look at his criticism regarding purchasing bitcoins on the exchange. He complains about being "quoted" a certain price and entering into a legally binding contract with MtGox (what?), then he gets upset when he places a market order and receives less BTC than his "quoted ... legally binding" price. He thinks he's buying bitcoin directly from MtGox...
"As I clicked “Yes” to that, that’s entering into a legally binding contract. But I wasn’t delivered X bitcoin – I was delivered X-56 bitcoin for the Y USD, which is a rather large difference. As I pointed this out to support, that they had an unfulfilled obligation of 56 bitcoin to me, they explained patiently how the quote price was calculated from a technical standpoint, why I had been charged a much higher price than quoted, and implied that the technology and interface were working just as designed."

I think people like OP are missing the clear message that everyone should take away from this. This isn't about a community of neckbeards making silly threats all willy nilly from their basement because they were upset about losing some magic internet money. This is an example of how *humanity* reacts to money.
Guess what, people won't hesitate to kill you and your children and defile your corpses if it means they'll have a chance at getting more money. Why do you think there's videos of drug cartels wrapping people in tires and lighting them on fire? Just what exactly do you think their ultimate goal is? To punish the wicked? To be respected members of society? For entertainment?? They want money, plain and simple, and that is just one tactic in their arsenal employed to achieve their end goal. It's all people ever want. 
So don't be so foolish as to think this is just some FUD anti-bitcoin propaganda tactic... don't fuck with people's money.
*edit* This post should not be interpreted as speculation regarding any particular event, but as a reminder how far human beings are willing to go for the sake of money. **Nothing more.**

No, that is not the point of an exchange, that is the point of your order type (which exchanges give you multiple options to choose from). A *limit order* will guarantee your rate and will only be executed when a buyer/seller is available for that rate (which doesn't guarantee it will be executed). A *market order* (which is the order type it sounds like this guy placed) will purchase at next available rate, regardless of price.

And it's glaringly obvious that he doesn't understand the entire concept of an exchange when he starts complaining about mtgox "quoting" him a price and not fulfilling their "legally binding contract". MtGox may have been a fractional reserve and a security nightmare, but it at least functioned properly as an exchange to execute trades in its internal orderbook.

...he says as he complains on the American website. 
It's no secret that Americans run some of the most popular websites on the internet, you can actually look this up...*[on the internet](
So considering the American origin of some of the largest and most useful websites, I say thank you...*for nothing*. I'll be sure to give my thanks though if I ever want to learn how to make a crepe.
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:12:21
It may just appear that way since Americans basically built \[the most popular and useful websites that you visit on a daily basis and therefore have a predominantly overwhelming exposure to American related sites on\]\*  the internet.
You're welcome.

Although he did say this in the comments section of the page:
"I’m planning on adapting this code as a ssh client library as it would be mostly identical (only the packet sequence is a bit different, as the client is “client”, it is the one initiating some parts of the protocol and not others).
Anyway it’d make a nice SSH2 client library in a class (SSH2Client) with a few other classes (Crypto for crypto-related stuff, and SFTPClient for sftp access)."

Um, if people are willing to burn people alive in rubber tires for money, then yes they are willing to steal from each other as well. That is, I thought, a very *obvious* possible outcome of this particular scenario. 
If people are willing to commit the most heinous acts of crime against one another in the name of money, then **obviously** they are willing to commit lesser crimes as well. The point of my post is to reiterate *how far* people will go for money, not *what happened in this specific scenario*.

What? What the hell are you talking about?
I replied to an obvious inaccurate statement with google &amp; fb, examples of multi-*billion* dollar organizations started by geeks from nothing (which is an insanely difficult task...google it).
You replied saying even though they *are* multi-billion dollar organizations (which was the main crux of the statement), they are not financial (which is a practically a moot point since it was not the message OP was conveying). 
I said to myself "jesus christ these fucking dweebs on this website" and googled up a quick list of financial related companies. I used fintech to narrow the search to return results of recent financially-*related* companies and not 200-year old financial institutions.
I posted results, and for some reason you keep on bitching instead of shutting the hell up and I keep getting suckered into replying to your stupid ass.
And if that wasn't enough to completely end this, I even went one step above &amp; beyond and looked up the history behind the largest financial company in the world. Apparently, it was started by some fellow named Warren Buffet (you *may* have heard of him?) who was also a [*socially awkward youth*](
So, to recap:
* We have the computer geeks (OP's point A) who created multi-billion dollar google &amp; fb, 
* We have the socially awkward Warren Buffet (OP's point B) who created the largest financial company in the world by revenue,
* And we have you being a stupid cunt (my point A).

When someone analyzed his white paper they concluded it was written in American English with the only exception being the word "favour". He took great pains to hide his identity from the beginning, and that probably includes purposely misspelling words and linking foreign articles.
He wasn't exactly gonna link to something like the Denver Post to give himself away.
