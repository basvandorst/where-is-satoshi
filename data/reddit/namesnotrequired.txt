I didn't speak about the role of governments and political "horse shit". The role of governments was my boss's concern. 
And yes, I did talk about being able to send money home securely and without fees. But the thing about Bitcoin explanations currently is there is no clear incentive to jump on board. This is like my trying to explain to people 15 years ago "Email! You can contact anyone across the globe instantly!" when they were doing very well with snail mail. Email and internet and computers would've been an additional unrequired investment.

I forgot to mention one of his more pressing concerns - what would determine the "value" of a country? Like Maldives being a tourist destination or India being an outsourcing destination? If there is no governmental incentive to continue doing it?

igot.com might help. I usually do all my buying from there, never sold, but they support it. They can NEFT it to your connected bank account.

Sorry to hijack this but I didn't want to open a new post for just this question,
What's the CoinBase situation now? I have a little under 1 BTC just sitting in my Coinbase account for about an year now. Not in the US, I've never used the exchange. The BTC was bought with other services and moved to Coinbase just to hold it.
Given that I just plan to hold on to the BTC indefinitely is it a good idea to keep it there? Or should I try paper wallets/other methods? My concern is not for their security as much as them asking for difficult to produce ID/other stuff when I want to move it (Especially since I am not in the US). 
Thanks.
