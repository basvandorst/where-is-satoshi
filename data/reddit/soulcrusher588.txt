I have a question, with the fork that occurred and people getting bitcoin gold, where could one sell it that is reputable? I have not seen any place that supports it and would rather get something else with it.

If it gets to that amount then I am cashing out enough to buy a trip to Universal Orlando with the family.

Pretty sad. I bought some percentage of a bitcoin at 4700 and several more bits below that amount. My paycheck is not coming in fast enough to buy these dips!
I have to thank Coinbase though. A deposit was supposed to go in yesterday and did not. I had to wait to buy and was rewarded today.

I would gladly take one!
As for your future, like many others have said, save and spend some of it. Enjoy some things you normally do not like getting drinks, coffee, whatever. Take a nice trip as there are places you can just pay in BTC that this sub mentions. Overall, this is a great find! Do you have any Bucket List/hobbies you wanted to start? Do something and you could even quit soon and enjoy a job that you want.
EDIT: Is this all on a wallet or exchange or something? Make sure it is all secure and I would diversify your funds so you have more safety.

I was about to say this looked familiar. I saw you in the litecoin sub and was wondering when someone would make this version. You did both, congrats.
