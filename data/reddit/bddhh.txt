Yes I totally believe you that you are in this whole shitshow because you'd rather use cryptocurrency to buy bubblegum right now today instead of just using your local everyday fiat currency.  Basically no real life stores accept bitcoin.  Even less than that accept any other crypto.

Well good for you, the money badger cares not.  Bitcoin is the most secure ledger in the history of mankind and you're trying to use it for coffee during it's growing pains.  Think about what you're saying.  You're an 'old hodler' and would rather hold Gold?  Gold has all sorts of security risks associated with it, so much so that people don't actually want it in their posession, they would rather have a paper that says they have some gold somewhere.

The early, and the very early days.  For whatever I know, the darknet markets moved away from BTC a long time ago.

It's run by a consortium of clownshoes douchebags who just wanna get rich(er), the only reason it has any value at all is because it's piggybacking off bitcoin's name, it doesn't really 'solve' anything, it's network can be attacked by a not so big mining pool just for funsies, and there are MANY other alts with real developers who do it better.  I think that's it.

Would you buy a coffee with a gold coin or a google share?  These are both also some type of currency.

The dip will come, weak hands will retreat, but there will be left more true believers than the previous cycle.  This will keep happening.  I feel its gotten too huge too soon as well to be honest.

It's a store of value in the sense that you can convert your dollars into it and no one can touch it.  This alone has HUGE value to people in the world.  Bcash is garbage that doesn't really solve anything.  8mb blocks still don't bring you ANYWHERE close to solving scaling.  Besides, why would I want my money in some assholes pet project when things like ETH, Dash, litecoin etc. exist?

What reason is there for Bcash to exist?  If you want fast and cheap crypto transactions to buy a coffee with there are MANY other cryptos which do it far better than bitcoin AND Bcash.  Bitcoin is the reserve crypto.  Bcash is a horseshit lie power grab by a group of immoral scumbags (who are all already rich as hell).

It's ok I'm sure Roger will be waiting patiently to buy it all up during the resulting dip

Cash that doesn't belong to me doesn't do me any good either
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:50:05
You've convinced me
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:42:55
I would fucking LOVE some peanuts

@_date: 2017-10-19 00:18:19
Because it would be dangerous to transmit them over the net

Why are gold coins and Lambos valuable?
