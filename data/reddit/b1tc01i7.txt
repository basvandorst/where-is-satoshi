Ah.. that's why there are so many listings on Craigslist of people offering to meet and pay cash for Bitcoin. 
Still, it's frustrating the Feds don't even recognize Bitcoin for what it is. We, and this entire community made all the investments and took all the risk.

Explain! I’m one of the few who do! It’s all going to her and the kids anyways.

Who doesn’t?

Disagree. 
How else can they survive against Amazon? This IS their make or break. If unsuccessful, they're getting pushed out of relevancy anyway. If successful, their early adoption will win them new customer loyalty and revenue.

What's some good alternatives that don't have the Ver'ster involved?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:32:54
Not that many judging by where the markets at today :p

I agree with you. But, it seems counter intuitive to cash out of all places now especially with the CME announcement and other institutional investments that are on the horizon.

While I agree with you, there's not a clear reason for the volatility in the last two days. Previous swings could be explained i.e. the China ban, Roger's attempt to migrate funds to bcash, etc. If someone could enlighten me what's making virtually every coin downtrend the way they are in the last 2 days that would be appreciated.

To me this defies reason. How is it almost every coin has the same peaks and valleys as the next? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:02:37
Well, on the surface it looked like the CME announcement was the reason for the rise and to me, it made sense. Why not get in before the institutional floodgates open?
And don't get me wrong. I appreciate the fact that it's unregulated. It's free market capitalism in its purist form. I'm just looking for an explanation to point to and these last 2 days don't appear to have a clear one.
