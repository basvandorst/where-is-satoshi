This. It's very funny to see the BTC holders screaming "muh decentralization" when comparing it with other coins.
I'm laughing when people suggesting that Bitcoin is trustless now (well, it is used to), you HAVE to trust Blockstream (for the development) AND the collusion of the top mining pools in China for verifying your transactions now.

Wow where are those losses from?

I agree, I wonder why there isn't any yet. Most of the clients are not user-friendly (user as in the average non-technical guy) since most of them assume that the user already has a knowledge in cryptocurrencies.
Maybe the most user-friendly interface I find is Dether (from screenshots) and DASH client.

...and then he bought more bitcoins.

I bought some BTC when it's at $2700 then it drops. I thought I just made a stupid mistake buying bitcoins and just "fuck it" and follow this HODL trend which I thought was stupid.
Now I understand.
Fucking. HODL.

After reading this, I felt that I'm a reckless bastard lol 
If I have that $1.6M cash, I would put it all in digital currencies. But I have knowledge and technical background to understand those technologies though.

Same here. I gain a little then lose a little. I'm a bad trader and just stock up and BTC and leave it. It's much more profitable that way.

This can be true to some coins, but not all. This is why the team behind a coin is one major factor when investing. If the team is solid, and backed by a trust-able party with solid roadmap, then it's almost 100% that their coin value would rise again.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be so sure.
And another this to consider is, what if a new coin with the same but better functionalities emerges that renders that one old coin useless? That old coin wouldn't have rise in value except if the devs  counter-react with a massive change.

I agree, at this point most of the cryptocurrencies are too complicated for the average person to use. 
I'm actually a programmer myself but I'm really ashamed that I've difficulties in setting up the wallet, trying to make a transaction, and understanding how the blockchain technology works.

Anyone knows why the BTC and other cryptocurrencies have massive jump around May 2017? I just entered cryptos after that :(
