The more fee you have the more your transaction is preferred. When there are lots of transactions you need a higher fee to have your transaction prioritized.

The most plausible transition would be a collapse of a national currency. It would be messy and wouldn't involve banks or government. People would naturally transition to it if inflation gets out of control.

If you are hoarding cash you are an idiot. You are pretty much garenteed to lose 2% every year to FED targeted inflation. Since the interest on savings is typically less than 2%, keeping it in a savings account is dumb, also.

No, I don't think so. If you are making profits in USD, then you are more than likely investing it somehow in an asset. Kinda like the stock market, you don't actually profit until you sell your stocks.
