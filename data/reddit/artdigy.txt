The funny thing is, bitcoin actually does not have an age limit. Just find an individual site that does not specify age, you then won't be violating any TOS. Local bitcoin transactions may help, you can also buy from a bank legally, and wall of coins will help find you one on your location. Hope this helps. I'm in the same dang situation and everywhere needs verification. Who are they to enforce age laws lol

The problem is that theres nothing saying what I did wasnt on the deepweb. Theres nothing I could have bought that would make sense. It was my money but I had to buy it through them with verification

It is neither of the last two. Congratulations, you are an absolute genius.

Yes it is? This is about a reasonable explanation for value loss. This isn't about some shit with my parents
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:15:46
Bullshit? Why the hell would I do that lol. I got away with it.

Fairly. For what purpose would the file sharing site be for? It certainly doesn't strike me as anything good since this is all based off of secret content.

is there a such thing as choosing an option for fast transfer? I could say this was with electrum. Im trying to justify a high fee so theyll believe me i guess, idk
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:14:56
Thanks, I tried this. They bought it instantly, I said I was trying to make it transfer faster and accidentally set my fees all the way up.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:22:29
im aware of that and i feel my regret. its nothing heavily illegal so please do not worry about that. i just need help out of this
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:16:51
If you were being for real I would, haha
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:12:45
No, I am looking for an explanation which includes transaction fees. It is less about the lie and more if the explanation of fees is making sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:12:04
hey, hey buddy. You're not entitled to know jack shit.

So would it be reasonable for something that was once 40$ in value to be 8$ by the time its transfered back? What happened was:
. bought with coinbase
. transfer out
. transaction (minus a fair deal of money)
. theoretical transfer back to coinbase
the wallet was electrum, would that be a good explanation
