Apparently the theif sent the coins to another address that has 290 ?

What is Coinbase?  I see he transfered 10 coins to Coinbase.
Would they be able to help?

So, i have the IP address that was used to withdraw my btc.  Anything I can do with it?  A quick scan shows that PPTP is open on that IP ( 1723 ) This most likely indicates whoever the douchebag is, used a VPN masking his tracks right ?

So i see there has been more activity at that link.  Can someone help me translate what it says?  Has the coins been spent?  Looks like another 290 bitcoins were sent to this wallet, so I suppose I wasn't the only one hacked.

windows 8, I don't do regular scans, i have windows defender installed.  My laptop is windows 7, again with defender.  The email from MtGox says to contact them immediately if I did not request the withdrawal.  I opened a ticket with them.  Not sure what they would be able / willing to do.

thats the address they sent my BTC to when they took it from my gox account. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:01:16
but all those addresses are most likely peoples wallets he stole from right?

From Gox,
Please file a police report in order for the police to investigate the case so that they can make an effort to retrieve the funds and once filing a police report, please send a copy of the police report and your official ID document to Mt.Gox. We will cooperate with the police authority in providing the necessary information for the investigation, but we are unable to reimburse any stolen funds.
