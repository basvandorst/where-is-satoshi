I apologize for the confusion during this process, please allow me to clarify. 
During the verification process, your bank holds the payment amount in an authorization check. 
If for whatever reason the verification process is unsuccessful and your payment is declined, the authorization will be voided and the money should be freed within 48-72 business hours thereafter.
I understand the frustration of waiting for validation while your card appears to have already been charged, and I hope this clarified some of your concerns! 
If you run into any other issues concerning your payment, please contact our support team by chat on simplex.com or by email at support
All the best,
The Simplex Support Team
