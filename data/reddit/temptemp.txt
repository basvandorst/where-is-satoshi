Bitcoin is worthless, but idiots pouring money into it make the price unpredictable. 
The only winning move is to make fun of the dumbasses who buy this shit.

Why is the bitcoin reaching for that man's crotch?
Why isn't the man trying to stop it?

Doesn't mean the doctor is smarter than the garbage man, it just means their circumstances were different.
If you think you are doing well because you're better than a poor person, you are a failure of a human being.

There's a company called 'Dwolla' that allows sending of funds instantly to anybody. It could also transfer funds to and from banks accounts instantly with a max fee of 25 cents. 
It used to be offered to consumers, but nobody used it. There's no market for anything resembling bitcoin in the consumer space.
Now, it's used exclusively by banks to transfer large funds.

I was pointing out the irony of his statement. It's in the poster's best interest to trash Buffet for acting in Buffet's best interest.
It's that kind of lack of self-awareness that makes talking to you people so much fun.

If you own bitcoin, promoting bitcoin is in your best interests. In this case, you are doing that by trashing Buffet.
And I can't believe you think pipelines are safe. They leak. A lot. Bitcoiners really are idiots.

IQ is a meaningless metric. 
Also relates to my original point. People with advantages when they are young tend to do better on IQ tests. If you swap a poor person's baby with a rich person's, the poor person's baby will probably be successful and the rich person's will not. 
That's why universal health care and free education are important. Everybody has high potential. Wealth disparity is why few can achieve that potential.

It's not really my job to find discussion points about bitcoin.
I think it's a worthless waste of resources, and I have never seen anything that makes me think otherwise. You have the burden of proof here, not me.
I believe that current monetary policy has paved the way for the most prosperous era in human history. I have no desire to overthrow governments and make the world a worse place for everyone.
If you don't have an irrational hate of government and an irrational love of businesses, all of bitcoins talking points fall apart.
Do you want to try to convince me that deflationary currencies are a good thing? Do you feel the need to discuss why a constricted money supply and lack of economic stimulus will make things better?
Go ahead.

You are clearly taking a stance on the safety of pipelines.
Are you trying to tell me that you were trying to say pipelines are safer, but still not safe?
I don't think you're capable of that kind of nuance.

Nevermind. I'm not going to be able to change your mind.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:24:48
Nevermind. It isn't really important.

Lol. Most of those technologies hit 50% in a decade. Bitcoin is still effectively zero.
Maybe convert it into a log chart? You guys used to love those.
'Failure to launch' is not the same as 'about to launch' when it comes to bitcoin.

Lol. The author is creating facts out of thin air faster than the government is printing money. 
If you actually believe this, it's no wonder you're still buying Bitcoin.

That comic is depicting the evils of DC current, which was dangerous and caused a ton of pollution. 
We use AC current now.

Bitcoiners really love their charts.
Fact is, 2.5 billion tethers have been created out of thin air.
The only use for tether is buying bitcoin.
I agree that tether is not the sole driver of market price, it can only amplify or soften where the price is actually headed. They are frantically buying cheap bitcoins to keep the price above 6k, just like they were frantically buying every bitcoin they could afford in late 2017 to cause scarcity and  inflate the price.
When bitcoin was popular in late 2017, tether was able to drive the price up. Now that interest has waned, tether is able to buoy the price by dumping money into the market.
You fancy charts completely ignore the correlation between tether printing and a rise in the price of bitcoin.

Yeah, those guys on really love innovative new tech.

These seem like valid complaints about bitcoin?
They aren't saying bitcoin is dead. Are you a fucking moron?
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:34:32
Knowing how to buy bitscoin doesn't mean you understand tech.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be stopped. It's going to burn out on its own.

Funding wars... and helping poor families and children eat via WIC and Food Stamps.

First, calling a computer a CPU is a widely accepted synecdoche. 
It's also true that a tower server can look a lot like a standard PC tower.
I'd be less inclined to trust a pedantic buttcoiner than I would the author of that article.

When an investment loses half of it's value, it's not panic selling, it's just cutting your loses.
