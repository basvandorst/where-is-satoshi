And you're right, there isn't a point to this song and dance. People so entrenched in their beliefs and opinions can be strongly opinionated at best and narcissistic about the subject, at worst. We can prance around all day and it won't get either of us anywhere.

I never said unsustainable. Good lord people are focusing on this pretty harshly. That wasn't even the point of my post. 
You completely misunderstood. I gauge economical success on the continued exchange of currency. When people are uncertain about the future, they save more, just in case. When they save more, they spend less. When less is spent, less goes around. 
I'm not saying there's anything implicitly *wrong* with saving, I'm pointing out a phenomenon that has been identified for decades.

1) Personal opinion, I thought iTunes was a bloated piece of crap, just like Windows Media Player at the time. If it takes longer than 15 seconds to start up on a moderately priced PC in 2005, it's garbage.
2) I'd prefer a cheap piece of crap that just works when I plug it into a PC with a drag and drop interface as opposed to click this check this drag this link this click this drop down this check this click verifylicense check click link drag click wait wait click check click drag OK.
3) A large subset of the population still prefers non-touchscreen smartphones. A touchscreen does not a smartphone make. Hell, if you can browse the Internet, check Youtube, check your E-mails, send and receive pictures, videos and sound samples with a reasonable level of quality, I'd consider that a smartphone.
4) I'll give them that with the iPad, they did do a decent job. However, they still take other ideas, polish them, then toss a huge marketing budget at it.
There's a -shitload- of other software patents that they own... "Innovation" can only go so far when you're guaranteed a lack of competition. I get it, invent a hunk of wood that holds a banana in the air to keep it fresh, you should be entitled to that fucking genius idea because shit, who thinks of that? But I mean, when you have software patents, many of which are only several lines long, with such that it's impossible to come to an identical result with a different set of code, then you end up *stifling* innovation and not enhancing it.
Do you have any sources stating that their physical hardware components are superior? Don't samsung and apple use the same Chinese manufacturer? And great customer service, heh... I know somebody who works in an Apple store, they are not permitted to **EVER** disagree with a customer, no matter how insane their statement is. They usually go through about half their staff every 3 months...
As for their warranty, I'll say this. If I sold somebody a fridge for $2000, that costed me $300 to make, and took that $1,700 and tossed it into an investment account that makes me $10,000 over 5 years, hell yea I'll buy them another fridge if it means they'll come back once this new one breaks!
And since you've been fair, I'll also confess. Somebody got me a MacBook for Christmas and I won an iPad as a part of an intra-office competition once. I tried using them but did not enjoy the experience, ended up giving them away. Why? When I meet with clients, I don't want to give off the vibe of a douchenozzle, and I *especially* don't want them to feel like I make more money than them. Apple products are largely a prestige item, and for men the impression it can project is comparable to the impression given off by a woman whom only buys expensive Gucci clothing.
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:14:46
1.) Winamp
2.) there were plenty of other mp3 players at the time, but it was the forced tie-in with iTunes that made them so popular (since Macs had a market share back then) and the lack of a reliable USB Mass Storage mechanism on Macs at the time
3.) Blackberries were great too, and they preceded iPhones by several years
4) There were also tablets at the time of the first iPad, and even prior so
So Apple isn't exactly innovative. What they are good at, is taking other people's ideas, polishing them up, throwing loads of money at their marketing departments, and implementing forced tie-ins such as iTunes. 
They're also *really* good with using their legal department. They own a software patent on pre-load technology that in a nutshell takes an image of what the application is displaying, saves it to memory, so that when the user swaps back the image is sent to the screen while the application is still otherwise warming up. Nobody else can use this, android, microsoft etc. So while the original iPhone/iPad had relatively crappy hardware considering the cost, they were able to use this software "trick" to make the user thinking the product was faster than it actually was.
Not to mention their products are so vastly overpriced! Why? If I take two identical steaks, and feed them to two people, and tell one guy his steak costed $5, and the other, that his steak costed $50, what will they think about the quality of their steak?
So in closing, Apple is not so great at innovation, than they are at making money, and parading a large following of people who reinforce the idea that they're a great company.

Actually, it's true... I held a CSC license for some time so I know a thing or two about it. 
History has shown that when consumer confidence is low, people save more. Why? Because there's more uncertainty about the future. 
An economy's success is literally dictated by the spending of money. When people are scared to spend, and allocate more funds for a rainy day,  less money goes into the economy, causing a snowball effect. 
How do governments encourage people to spend instead of save? Low interest rates. However, interest rates have been low for so long that it's caused another problem: People are so far in debt that they can't spent. So now, it's a double whammy.

What are you even getting at? I don't understand your argument. What's your angle? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:12:55


I'm 34 years old, and yes I remember the "bad old days." Dangerous thing, them assumptions be. Winamp was probably one of the first half-decent mp3 players that didn't look like a total piece of shit. And it didn't take 10 minutes to load and slow your computer to a crawl. And actually, Winamp //did// have a store for some time but again, lack of publicity.


And now you're just being insultingly repulsive.  as indicated the present market share for OS X is roughly 8% (I'm referring to the O/S, not the hardware). I do not believe it exceeded that point, even prior to the iSeries.
Macs at the time costed a hell of a fortune (they still do but not as badly) and due in part to the iTunes tie-in, coupled with the inflated price of their equipment, they became a symbol of prestige. Like gucci purses.
If I gave two people two pieces of steak from the same package, and told one guy I spent $5 on his piece, and I told the other guy I spent $40 on his, which one of them will automatically assume the hunk of meat is "high quality," even if I actually just found it in a dumpster behind a chinese restaurant?


I'm sorry you feel that way. I beg to differ. While everybody else was still working around their clunky flip-phones whose version of "Internet" was a WAP portal, and whose "apps" were an extremely broken down and limited version of java, with a set of apps that couldn't be more basic than a simple calculator, I was sending and receiving E-mails with business clients, editing excel spreadsheets on the fly, submitting orders for customers, providing quotes, and generally running a business, all on a blackberry if I had to.
But hey, it's just a glorified feature phone, right?


Very untrue. It's been.. nearly 10 years now so I don't recall the actual name of vendors, but one of my clients was a hospital whom I issued a ton of "tablets" to. Sure, they weighed half as much as a laptop, ran a stripped down copy of Windows XP, but they had a touchscreen, 8-10 hours of battery life, could survive a fall from the 3rd storey of a building, and were OR certified. After every surgery you just toss them in a sink (although we opted for airtight disposable plastic covers instead, just in case)
Try doing that with an iPad, even WITH an otterbox.
I think we charged the hospital $900 per unit for those bad boys.


Shall we compare notes on that front? For the sake of argument I'll just ignore the enormous rack that's humming away behind me...


Recent innovations by phone manufacturers that are NOT apple: RFID, NFC, Samsung Super AMOLED Displays rebranded as "Apple Retina," Bluetooth, Enterprise Facilities, Encrypted E-mail facilities, the capability to hook up your device to your TV over wifi, and .. oh right...
I'm just a young fanboy who pretends to understand tech but doesn't.

If an exchange wanted to operate in Canada now, it would need to be registered as a securities trading business, with licensed staff and the whole nine yards. 
As btc has been classified as a good and not a currency, commodity trading rules kick in. Some of those rules include AML reporting, proper staff licensing, taxing, insurance etc.

They never once revealed what exactly it was they were investigating, it wasn't until I put a lawyer on retainer and sent them a nice little mail that they complied and gave me my funds back.

* Electronic devices of any sort
* Any kind of counting or adding machine ie. abacus
* Multiple items in one order, since you can count with those
* Paper
* Pens 
* Minerals of any sort (since you can scratch them and thus, count!)
Oh heck, they better stop working with fiat and create their own non-reversible currency, since that can be used for bitcoin too!

The reasons for that are beyond me, and I already thought about it... but is it safe to assume that if it was easily possible, that the manufacturers would have done so already?

Litecoins algorithm is way different than BitCoin. Specifically, it's made a hell of a lot more complex, and requires a ton of RAM to run (512kb PER HASH).
It's designed this way to prevent FPGAs and ASICs from dominating the market; so the average joe with a home PC can make a few bucks.
@_date: 2013-06-04 14:55:37
Okay... I don't think I explained it well. Maybe my social skills are lacking today, or it's just a lack of sleep, lol.
For each hash run, *AT LEAST* 512kb of memory needs to transfer to and from the cpu or processing core. This is why memory bandwidth is so crucial. 90% of GPUs are limited by how much memory can be transferred per clock, not by their actual shader core speed.
Video cards have specially designed transfer busases to facilitate the transfer of data from RAM to shader cores. These busses often run at extremely high speeds, and are now approaching 1 TB/sec.
In contrast, with a 2400MHz quad-channel memory config on my sandy bridge-E rig, I top out at 54 GB/sec of memory bandwidth.
Now remember, video cards have not yet exceeded 1 MH/s yet... the highest end cards often have several GB of DDR5 overclocked RAM and overclocked cores. I am the owner of a 7970, and when I mine litecoin, I use the entire 4 GB of my GPU RAM (as indicated by GPU-Z) and oly get ~500 kh/s.
To approach speeds in the MH or hell even GH range, ASICs/FPGAs would need memory transfer busses that could trasnsfer data in the dozens-of-TB/sec range and dozens-of-GB-of-capacity. This isn't something that's even been invented yet; there isn't even a clock generator that can go that high, and GDDR is extremely expensive as well.
So, while you are right, this barrier will eventually be broken; but it will be a very long time before it is, and in order to do so, we would need to break several major hurdles first, and would basically need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to system design.

TL;dr the technology required to build the ultra-WTF-high-speed busses required to mine via ASIC or FPGA haven't been invented yet and would cost millions if not tens of millions to research and years upon years.
@_date: 2013-06-04 14:28:26
The barrier to entry for ASICs and FPGAs is much higher than GPUs. 
AMD  etc have already done their homework on very high capacity high speed memory busses for use on GPUs. This isn't a trivial task. It takes years of research as well as T&amp;E to solve those problems. And I'll bet you top dollar they keep that research to themselves. 
Developing memory busses to feed 100s if not 1000s of cores is no simple task. 
BFL devices have what, 64MB of standard speed RAM?
