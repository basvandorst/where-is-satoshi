I'd be happy if coinbase worked with paypal. Being able to transfer money directly into paypal would be helpful at times.

More people need to use Coinbase. I stopped using Mt. Gox and CampBX when Dwolla stopped working with Bitcoins.

No, the design is very similar they're both 8 cpu cores + IGPU but the clocks are different as is the IGP.
The PS4's GPU has more stream processors, meaning is a bigger stronger GPU. The PS4 also uses a unified 8GB chunk of GDDR5 that's faster than the Xbone's DDR3 2133 plus 32MB eSRAM.

I would spend bitcoins on Dell monitors. If they still sold the m11x I would buy one of those. Same goes if they made an updated WP8.1 version of the Dell Lightning/Venue Pro.
Hell I might actually buy more Dell products now because of this.

Is Litecoin ok instead? Because I don't think coinbase supports Monero. Unless you have better info?
I've been out of the game for awhile.

Yeah Bter is fucked so I just converted the few light coins I had in their network to Bitcoin. I'm going to just let them sit for the moment since I'm still making money that way. But damn is this BS and the assholes who ran Cryptsy need to be strung up.

Both the US and EU nations need to pass laws requiring all businesses to withhold taxes. Most of this is done with accounting software now so it shouldn't be that difficult or costly to the business.
I didn't think this way ten years ago. I've watched elderly neighbors loose their pension benefits and I live in the Chicago-land area in Illinois.
I'm just waiting to see which of the two declares bankruptcy first. As our new Governor is having a show down about budgets and spending. And sure enough the teachers' unions are going around protesting everyone.

So who would handle your money or do lending?
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:27:08
Because their government played no part in borrowing massive amounts of money they could not pay back and cycling debt.
That's not even counting the people who flat out refused to pay their taxes because they could get away with it.
Banksters? Grow up.

Such a currency would have no value if not backed by anything other than a promise.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:44:25
So what you want the banks to shut down so there is no lending or credit of any kind?
The Greek government made bad choices and continued to make them. Combined with insane pension benefits and massive tax fraud by the people.
They all took turns fucking each other. Now it's the morning after the party and people have to face reality.
And you better believe this is going to happen in the US. Detroit was just the first. I'm waiting to see when Chicago defaults/declares bankruptcy.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:34:00
You cannot depend on a pension.
In this case the Greek government fucked up everything combined with a large enough portion of the populace wanting unsustainable pension benefits and massive tax fraud.
Here in the US we have similar problems with the public employee pensions not being funded yet they keep voting for politicians who promise them everything.
* Pensions do not give you any control over your money.
* They usually do not continue paying after your death so your family can be fucked.
* They're often not even properly funded by the government. Or if its a private corporation with a pension they're often funded with company stock.
* The Government/Courts can allow them to be raided.

You're idiot, a big part of this is their own government's doing. Trying to pin this all on banks shows how much of an ignorant tool you are.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:16:25
G.W. Bush wanted to put controls in for SSI and all hell broke loose.

6970s aren't really on the market any more and they have very little OC ability. I get around 390Mhash on mine.

I honestly have no idea how good that card is vs the price. Look up the performance of that card when it comes to mining. People have been compiling charts of all the different models It would also help to go to the Bitcoin forums.
That Motherboard &amp; PSU will both support 3 cards perfectly. The PSU could actually do a forth when you're ready to get crazy.
edited for spelling &amp; grammar.

I started mining with my gaming rig and snatched up several HD 5800 cards for mining. They've all paid for themselves already.

Mobo: 
CPU: 
Memory: 
PSU: 
This case: 
Do you have any spare hard drives? You only need a few gigs to hold the OS &amp; mining software. 
Do you have video cards or do you need to buy some?
@_date: 2012-03-23 07:55:51
I have one of those in my gaming PC, when I'm not gaming on it I mine Bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-09-13 00:19:06
No we could do it, and it would make many things easier. There are a lot of parts of government we could now do without. 
@_date: 2011-09-13 00:12:56
When you own tens of thousands of bitcoins you can easily make all of that back as the price goes back up.

I just went through some trouble to finish pulling a bit of money out of okpay from Mt Gox.
I really do not care to use a Google service with their data retention and their tracking policies. Even if they made it super easy compared to the crap I just went through.

Could you please tell me what an assault rifle is?
@_date: 2013-05-15 12:53:39
Well I just signed up with them. I've also decided to stop messing around and start buying silver with bitcoins after this as well. Since I have a local shop I can sell precious metals at directly if need be.

Why would we need to save polar bears? Their population has only gone up since the 70s.
@_date: 2013-07-24 18:19:39
I made the mistake of trying OkPay after the Dwolla shut down.
The only way I would go back to Mt Gox after that disaster is if they partnered directly with Amazon or Paypal. So that I could have easy access to shopping/spending my money.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:43:16
As a company probably, as a person I doubt it or else we wouldn't see all of those cash for gold places every where.
