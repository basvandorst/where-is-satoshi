Having trouble with Gemini; their daily limit isnt refreshing. Bought BTC a few days ago and the "daily" limit is still at 0.
Anybody else having this problem or know how to fix it?
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:42:58
I did, and they dont.

Having trouble using coinbase since I only have a US passport.
Im currently trying with Gemini, but do any of you have alternative suggestions of an exchange with which I can make a quick transfer?
I literally just want to transfer someone $715 in Bitcoin, and it's becoming a huge hassle.

Of course I did, its just frustrating since it had been stable for so long and starts fluctuating like this shortly after I try to purchase something

Can anyone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:16:39
Thats seems a bit over simplified

Next month or two(?)
