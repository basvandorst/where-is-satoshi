My point exactly!! I couldn't have said it better. Thanks for the support

Have you even read the whitepaper? It clearly states that bitcoin was designed as an online peer to peer PAYMENT SYSTEM...
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:04
I never said that I, or anybody else, can't run a node. 
The point was about payments.. Idiot....

Yeah, seriously. It's sad

Your ignorance is astounding. I assume you have holdings in the original chain, and those holdings are blinding your ability to see reason.
It is not my job to read the entire white paper, and I sure as hell am not going to paste the entire thing. Go read it yourself.
I'm done arguing with people who haven't done their research.

You are a fool. It is only now in the midst of competing chains that you are adopting the idea of bitcoin as a settlement layer instead of a p2p payment system.
Bitcoin was always intended as a peer to peer online electronic payment system. Satoshi spells it out in his white paper.
Please stop spouting bullshit. Thanks

Right... It's clear you are the one that doesn't know what you're talking about. I'm done arguing with fools.

"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
PAYMENTS to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution"
Read the god damn white paper before you make a fool of yourself.

You have no basis to believe that I have not read it.
I have read it many times. Damn.. It's sad to see people making accusations like this when they don't know what the fuck they are talking about
