Excellent idea! The money is the incentive, though, and I wonder how much people would need to get in, for the bike to pay itself.
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:24:03
Precisely the point of Blockchain is client-side encryption.

"we ~~are known for double spending in the past~~ won't do anything bad, we promise."
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:17:17
No. Voluntary taxing means you declare what you have, and you're taxed according to that.
Of course, if you declare less than you have, and they can prove it, bad things are gonna happen.
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:17:15


No. You can always broadcast a forged transaction.
If you own the private key of X, you can broadcast a transfer of 500BTC from X to Y. But if X doesn't have 500BTC + fees at the time you made it, it won't get confirmations.
Confirmations are just that, confirmations for a transaction validity--so you can find invalid transactions too.
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:50:27
It doesn't. There are no taxes on Bitcoin, and if there were, [they'd probably be voluntary](

Sounds like magic. Let's everyone buy that magic product so we can be rich!

I thought so, but it doesn't even run any JS or tell something is bad, it only recommends installing the official Blockchain extension...

I always like to have the source available. It means I can go further away than just using the app--I can fix bugs myself, propose features, create my own or just learn.
It also means I don't need the restrictive Google Play to enjoy the app.
@_date: 2013-03-24 09:35:30
Not with [RepRap]( --it is low-cost &amp; open-source.
I guess it won't be very precise, though.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:24:53
It means most people don't like you.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:14:06
To send BitCoins, you have to be connected.  
Concretely, you can create &amp; sign a transaction offline,
but then you must go to an online computer and broadcast that
transaction to the **whole internet** to make it effective!
Isn't it exciting?
That means, if you want to pay to a person BUT neither of you
has an Internet connection at hand, you can sign a transaction
to his address, and give it to him so he can broadcast it and get paid.
**It works like a check**: you don't have the money,
but the order to transfer the money.
Advantage: only you can create it, and it will only get
to the account you specified.  
Big disadvantage: broadcast that check the sooner possible,
because a single transaction made *before*, can invalidate it.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:00:14
No, the EEE technique wouldn't work here. Sorry.  
edit: it's fixed now.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:09:49
+1, but your thoughts have an invalid assumption: that online people are tech-savvy people.

One more thing... how do you kill an anonymous person?
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:55:32
@_date: 2013-06-23 15:07:31
1. The Bitcoin foundation is dedicated to **promote** Bitcoin.
2. Since the Bitcoin currency **is not managed by the Bitcoin foundation** (it is not managed by anyone at all) **it can't be corrupted**.
3. (just in case) The Bitcoin Foundation can get corrupted, but again, **that doesn't affect Bitcoin legitimacy** in any way.
This is not the case with Ripple, which is managed by a central authority (the OpenCoin company), so it can easily get corrupted. Visit [ripplescam.org](
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:43
Great point as well. People would start using Coinbase en masse... xD
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:09:44
The benefit of Bitcoin resides in its use rather than posession.
Once you have, say, 2 Bitcoins, you can be ***absolutely*** sure that they're yours, and no one else's (read: no bank can freeze or rob from your bitcoin "account").
Also, the Bitcoin currency is **international** and **secure**. Every transactions are done directly, without passing by a central entity.
Finally, since the "printing" of Bitcoins is slow and will eventually stop, you don't have to worry about inflaction.

Well, "How?" actually expands to "How can/will they?".  
You should clarify the message a bit, I think. ;)
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:56:19
Looking great! Where can I find the source?
@_date: 2013-06-27 11:27:37
Could you explain why do you say that, and its relation with Bitcoin? At least post a link.
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:18:37
Instead of ray-tracing, you could use phisically based renderers,  
such as [LuxRender]( (it's open-source).
They produce extremely realistic images, the inconvenient is  
that they take soooooo much time to render...
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:21:36
Pssst! Our whole economy and infrastructure *depends* on connectivity and electricity; if lights go out, the dollar/euro economy will collapse, and some might even lose their money (not with Bitcoin, however).

Read the rules before posting.  
Oh wait, you're a bot.
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:19:19
Bitcoin needs to "legitimize" itself to survive, or it will die after a year of being launched... OH WAIT!
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:42:04
Plus the fact that the Bitcoin currency and its clients (wether Android, or not) are all open-source. This isn't exactly a client, but...
@_date: 2013-06-05 07:22:38
The use of Bitcoin is of course legal. It can't
be otherwise. Bitcoin is unregulable.
However, when we come to *trading* Bitcoins for fiat, then things aren't as easy (for the company, not for you).
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:03:03
If by security you mean Bitcoin, then no, it needn't be installed on personal computers, see for example

Don't worry, it's normal.

Read a bit, and you'll see many criticism *in this same thread*.
@_date: 2013-09-08 11:16:05


hello? are you really bitcoin dealers?
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:12:23
+1 You *rock* now.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:38:57
Well, use a P2P (physical) exchange service. You meet with a person, he gives you Bitcoins and you pay him the money. No questions asked. This is closer to anonymity, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:48:12
I suppose they will have no choice but to *let you declare* what you have.  
Tracking your accounts would be difficult and mostly ineffective.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:09:34
Of course, because when someone scams your users after DDoSing your site, you're really calm and have time to make a great professional discourse.
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:50:19
Wrong, wrong, **wrong**. Bitcoin can't *comply* with something, Bitcoin itself is a currency, a computer program, a network of Internet peers with no leader. You can't just make Bitcoin comply with something.
Good article though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:01:25
Sounds like that, but in the real world it would be more difficult, IMO.
You can't just look for IPs and charge people for that. Some people wouldn't get charged (people that steal neighbour's WiFi xD) while others would get a high tax, etc.
And if you made a few million... you'd make sure they cannot find it.
So in the end you'd be declaring what you have, and getting fines if they can prove you've declared less.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:01:40
I generally agree, however not sure if this is a violation of that rule since it's just text in the linked image. You can't even prove the address is he's.
@_date: 2013-07-08 18:15:51
The article is a bit misguiding. Bitcoin doesn't even *need* a legal status. It's unregulated, which means you can't easily know, for example, how many Bitcoins a person posess.
@_date: 2013-09-08 09:55:37
Bitcoin enthusiasts usually like to constructively criticise everything, not just stay quiet and upvote.

He doesn't even know what a bubble is.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:53:42


Assassinated?! When I read "attacked", I thought you meant other things.
It would, among other things, give the idea: "Bitcoin is so robust and revolutionary, that the only thing governments can do to scare me is attack one of the many developers."  
Bad for them, good for Bitcoin.


Well, it seems like that, but in practice I don't think it would cause so much damage. Ok, *one* of the many people that help *maintain* the --already stable-- currency has died. Does this affect me or my money directly? No.
I mean, Bitcoin is already secure, we could probably run it a few months before we needed to change something. Plus, the fact that there's a vibrant community makes it harder for someone to sneak malicious code into our Bitcoin clients.
Of course, it would be a lot of forks, we only have to agree in one of them and keep it under some control.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:53:52
Appearently, if your computer gets hacked it's a vulnerability of Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:30:18
+1 You're right.
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:14:58
+1 Agreed. I was comparing to other things.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:54:05
Brilliant arguments.
@_date: 2013-06-25 07:04:20
Now say me how does that law define "Bitcoin". Bitcoin is an abstract thing, it's not physical, it's not concrete, it's just zeros and ones flowing through a net.
How do you determine I'm using Bitcoin?
Because I'm using the software? Well, in that case, we can rewrite the core client and it will no longer be "Bitcoin".
Because I'm using the protocol? In our rewrite, let's change the protocol as well.
Because I'm connecting to the IRC Bitcoin channel to look for peers? That's easy to change as well.
Using that port? Same as above.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:02:53
It's cool and that, but don't you think it's too much to make a Bitcoin cake? It's like "Hey, Bitcoin matters more than your birthday". :/
@_date: 2013-05-11 07:58:39
Wait, how do we know the private key of this address is lost?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:59:52


It's not about achieving anonymity. Being anonymous is just *hiding* your identification. Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it doesn't hide your info, in fact it provides even the IPs originating transactions.
It's simply that Bitcoin, by nature, doesn't provide the info you need to charge taxes. *It doesn't hide info* (anonymity) *it just doesn't provide it to you.*


But the question is, would that estimation be reliable? Is it ok you automatically charge millions of people for rogue "estimations"?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:04:58
Actually, BitCoin HAS a divisibility limit. But it's practically impossible to reach it...
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:59:22
I love the last phrase.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:20:34
I doubt that.
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:57:49
This is not a phenomenon of Bitcoin but of any opensource product. If that was to happen, then it would be immediately discovered and a fork created.
You see, Satoshi is **not well known** by the community--we have never known who he is. He just published the source. In opensource, you *don't look at the person*, because *we all own the code*.
Bitcoin got popular because of the source, not because that person was popular.
The same can happen again. But faster.
@_date: 2013-08-10 09:51:57
The Bitcoin protocol is constantly getting updated, but these are usually minor changes. If new functionality was introduced, and that functionality altered Bitcoin's essence or the way it's used, I doubt it'll be welcome by most people or just forked and rolled back.
As per what you said, *strong ID procedures*...
 1. Are already there. Cryptography ensures that if you send money to an address, only the one having the keys will be able to use that money. To authenticate yourself you use your private keys.
 2. Aren't already there. In that case, that'd require having a *centralized entity* certify the keys of someone, which is completely *against* the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.
So if you wanna be absolutely sure the other end is who you think, just hang up with him and write down his address. Period.
Or you can trust some organization to verify the other end, if you're sure they are honest. But that's out of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:13:59
You forgot to say:


@_date: 2013-06-24 16:58:28
Please, tell me how could you specifically outlaw Bitcoin while still allowing any other forms of communication between computers.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:56:19
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:43:30
Also, what has "associated server costs" to do in opensourcing it?
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:53:02


That allows for discussion. One can consider Bitcoin as the implementation rather than the specification of the Bitcoin protocol. But what is clear is, one thing is the businesses, and another is Bitcoin itself.
**You** (and many other people, me included) may have realized that the author meant the first, but the average person, which knows zero or little about Bitcoin, will understand the second.
So it's worth to point out that the quote is misleading in that way.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:10:04
No I wasn't. However, instead of "enabling" (Bitcoin will always be there unless [the Internet's shutdown]( you should have said "accepted" or "supported".
@_date: 2013-08-07 22:11:31
It was sarcasm.
