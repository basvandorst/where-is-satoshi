I think the lesson learned is that initial decisions like this are incredibly hard to change in something like Bitcoin, where people develop hard entrenched positions based on the status quo.
Now, if you had put in something that's adaptive to change, or forces change, we might not be in the mess we're in now.  Bitcoin is political, and when politicians put in something they can't exactly agree on, they put in a timelimit, forcing re-negotiation.  It isn't a perfect solution, but it's often times better than the alternative.  A simple example might be "if block &lt; 2 years-from-now, limit=1mb, else no-limit."  You can always change it within the 2 year limit, but what it sets is a precedent from the designers.  i.e. we think we need a limit for now, but we forsee a time when this will need to scale.  
I think we need to start thinking about bitcoin as a model for human co-operation rather than a technology.  This may seem obvious, but it seems to me that you largely thought of this as a techinical problem without thinking about the human issues of consensus.  
That's forgivable since you're all technologists, not psychologists.  It's a trap of having too many people in technology that have little exposure to human side of things.

Thanks for the link.  Very interesting.  
I don't really keep up on all the politics and don't have a huge familiarity with what's leading the people involved, so this article provides a much needed background.
