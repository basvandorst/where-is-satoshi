Just by giving examples of logical fallacies and attempting to give me a crash course in logic you are doing nothing to refute my argument that rising atmospheric carbon levels are directly rising due to human activity. 
To attempt to refute my argument, or prove it to be one of these fallacies that you are giving me examples of, you need to provide counter-arguments and evidence that defeats my argument and proves it to be a fallacy. 
Let me help you out here. Do you have an alternative scientific explanation for why the carbon levels are rising exponentially in the 20th and 21st century?  As to your statement on "do scientists agree to the same degree" -- can you show me studies where scientists are actually giving alternate explanations for rising carbon levels? How about explanations for observed effects being blamed on climate change such as coral bleaching in the great barrier reef? Then you would at least begin to debate this correctly.

So when Saddam decided to sell his oil in a currency other than the US Dollar, he was "forced" to make sure that the USD continues to be the dominant petrol-backing currency.

The exponential rise in carbon levels in the atmosphere has coincided with the industrial revolution and human activity in the last 100 years or so, and is growing ever faster. Carbon is a greenhouse gas that can cause this warming effect. I think if you are totally objective, those two facts are enough to tell you who or what is causing the warming.

I am not entirely convinced about this chart reading - technical analysis stuff.. does it really work?
