We suspect this because multiple exchanges were hit at the same time. The reason gox went down harder than the others was because it is by far the single biggest exchange with an already notorious lag problem.

Just to clarify, you sold 5 shares (currently valued at 0.004btc each on btct.co and even less on Mpex) and managed to lose 1.2btc in the process. In turn, this would mean that you lost 0.24btc on each share and assuming you sold recently (1 week or less) you bought each share for approximately 0.2405btc?
That sounds... off.

Personally, the moment Krugman endorses bitcoin, I'll have to re-evaluate whether I myself want to continue to be involved in this experiment. I consider Krugman a reality-contrarian and will feel incredibly nervous if we seem to be in agreement over anything economics.

Common misconception, they put together a pseudo-protoype that missed all targets of hash speed and efficiency for one of the bitcoin devs who also writes software for bfl but they never shipped it anywhere due to the aforementioned missing of every target.

~96%, and I have zero regrets. While the price was falling after the first bubble I was buying all of the things that I had planned to buy previously but procrastinated; when it was more or less stable, I used it as a currency, spending them and quickly rebuying what I spent; while the price is readjusting up, I'm using it as a store of value/speculative vehicle. That's what I love about bitcoin, no matter what it does with respect to fiat currency, it is still incredibly useful!
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:59:58
That depends entirely on your definition of worthwhile. I know it may seem like my posts are useless, but it's all about eliminating ambiguity to get you the best answer. For example, if a "worthwhile investment" is one you can make 10% in a year in, then I would venture to say that yes, bitcoin is a worthwhile investment (regardless of how much you put in to start). However, if a "worthwhile investment" to you means putting a $1,000 and being a millionaire tomorrow, then no, I doubt bitcoin will be a "worthwhile investment."
The above is based on the assumption that you eventually will want to "cash out" of btc back to usd.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:34:10
Ah, if I had to venture a guess, I would say that you have a very small amount of bitcoin spread over many different addresses in your wallet so that whenever you try to send any, the client is forced to collect the "dust" from all of your addresses and send them as one "over the size limit" transaction for which, in the qt client, you do have to pay a transaction fee. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:28:35
From a purely legal standpoint (should you choose to comply with the laws), you would have to register as an MSB or risk being shut down hard.
Depositing and withdrawing hundreds/thousands of dollars MAY get you flagged, but it really depends on just how often and how much you transfer. For example, cash deposits over $10k at a time are reported to the government by the bank.

Drinking the kool aid is in reference to the Jonestown massacre (run of the mill cult thing) where a bunch of people got together and killed themselves by drinking a poisoned kool-aid rip off called flavor aid.

I've been involved with bitcoins since the first bubble and I have felt probably every possible emotion with respect to bitcoin and I felt them so often that I've sort of numbed to it. I am watching this current rise with extreme fascination, but no emotion. Kicking yourself over not buying bitcoins earlier will serve no purpose but to make yourself feel bad, so my humble advice, is to let the past be the past and focus on the present and future!

That's a good strategy; remember all those posts about people kicking themselves for not buying 2-3 years ago (then not buying because they're "too expensive," then not buying because they're "waiting for the bottom," and etc.)? Those same people will be kicking themselves even harder a couple more years down the road. Don't be one of those people. Or do, far be it from me to offer financial advice online!

I can only answer with respect to the United States, but in the US it is perfectly legal to purchase/possess spores as there is no active hallucinogenic compounds contained within the spores. However, growing those spores into full blown psychedelic mushrooms IS illegal because the actual mushrooms DO have the prohibited hallucinogenic compound(s).
There may be one or two states with exceptions to this, but off the top of my head I don't remember them and frankly am too lazy to look it up.
Hope that helps!

Maybe next time either send with less of a transaction fee than you could possibly win or send more so that the potential winnings would be greater than the transaction fee?

I've seen this posted so many times and I can never tell if the it's a joke or not. Do you, and I guess others, honestly believe that BFL built a working ASIC and are hashing with it prior to sending it off? How, pray tell, do you expect hashing power about 1.5-2x the size of the entire current network to exist and hash in secret (hint: it's not possible)?
I'm certainly no BFL fanboi (Avalon batch 3 all day), but I think Occam's razor applies here; they're not hashing maliciously because they are too incompetent to have working hashing devices to begin with.

1) The value of the currency is decided by the intersection of the supply of that currency and the demand for that currency.

Those that break the rules of trading ("don't put in more than you can afford to lose" and "don't trade based on emotion") deserve what they get. Plus, we've been rising too fast lately anyway, a steady 3-5% rise weekly would be much better in the long term than a 10% daily climb followed by a 50% crash repeated over and over.

In simplest terms, if you plan on selling btc that you mined for usd you have to register as an Money Service Business (although if you sell small amounts you probably wont be noticed), however, if you spend those btc on products as opposed to dollars, you don't have to report anything or pay any tax.

Gave out about 30btc to friends and family when they were around $3 each. Of the 15 people who got 2btc each, 12 of them lost their coins due to carelessness (didn't back up wallet, or take ANY protective measures), 2 of them sold in the low double digits, and exactly one is still holding and even bought more for himself after they really read into what bitcoin was/is.
The reason that I regret giving out the coins isn't the lost potential profit (though that certainly doesn't help) but the fact that all but the one person who held and bought in more are mad at me (well, really themselves but god forbid people blame themselves for anything they do so they project it onto me) for their lost gains on something that they were given for free. That whole episode really gave me a good insight into what kind of people my friends are; that's what I really regret.
