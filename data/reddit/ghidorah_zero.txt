Venezuela is a poor country, but it still has millions of people trying to protect their purchasing power from centralized devaluation, with very few options. Stack the movement of Venezuelan citizen value flow on top of overall global flow into cryptos, and you have a not-insignificant contribution to accelerated movements...price is determined at the margin.

The conditions in places like Venezuela are where ordinary people show the world how its done...its places where business is as usual where adoption is slower and ordinary people don't use it. I would guess that as a percentage of total population, bitcoin has more acceptance in Venezuela than over in the states...but that is just a wild guess.

so true...

True. e.g. when I was in Vietnam, the govt is communist, but on the street and everywhere you go, capitalism reigns supreme.

us economy is driven by labor, brain power and energy, all else derives from that.

Yep...I remember in bali, the govt police would stop the drivers and impound a "toll" along given stretches of roadway...

Its pretty clear that BTC is better than gold, for the time being...it is devoid of the "inconvenience" of transporting value in the manner that gold is often smuggled into India.

08' wasn't an economic collapse, it was a blip on the radar...the distribution channels still operated, food was still put on the table, etc.  Granted, markets temporarily sank, but in retrospect, 08 was a a nothing burger.

As you point out, the lack of electricity for crypto transactions is one the many many risks of buying into the cryptos. Gold has taken a beating lately, so since you seem to have an affinity for the yellow metal, buying weakness now is better than chasing strength on a run-up.  Even if it drops more, your downside risk is probably limited to $50-200 max, with unlimited upside potential over a longer time period.  Why not buy a small position now, and have additional larger buy orders in increments of minus $50? It feels like gold is transitioning, and at some point, I think it will go on a major run, not unlike 2001-2011.  No one knows when it will commence, but when it does, you are either in or not, and if not, chasing price might happen.
But regardless of whether the electricity stays on or not, or gold goes up or down, BTC has clearly outperformed gold in terms of price and capital appreciation. Whether gold or BTC is better at preserving value into the future, no way to tell until we get there. But I can tell you one thing for sure, one is going to outperform the other.

regardless of the price of bitcoin by 2020, it will be funny to see him sweat a bit over having to eat his own dick.
