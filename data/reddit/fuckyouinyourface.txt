That's why you keep buying more. With this strategy you can't lose. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:22:30
What goes down must go up. Seriously, this is a massive buying opportunity. Buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy. This is why I buy at $10 or $11k and sell at $15-$19k.

Jokes on them as you will just keep buying more.

But nothing will be as popular as bitcoin. It has the branding and is the gold standard. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:27:06
You could, but I am pretty sure the mining companies know what their cost is. If they don't, you don't want to be using them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:26:33
You have to deduct the cost of mining to get the true profit margin. All that infrastructure and all those developers cost money.

No one ever knows if they got in too early or too late until you see the baby pop out 9 months later. You need to hold for 9 months as a rule of thumb. You made this baby, might as well ride it out.

It's going to the moon. Get in while you still can.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:25:36
I hope it gets to over $100k, and then a million. It's going to the moon! There is no holding back.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:18:20
You could run a meter on the outlets that run your mining?

It can't go to zero!

If we believe it, it will come true. Same thing with (every other) coin that is coming into existence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:56
He would but maybe he would double down and buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:41:24
You will be ok because in a year you can laugh at the people who bought at $100k after it drops to $30k. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:03:31
BI-LO SELL-HI. It's in a range. Make money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:39
It can't go to zero!!! Eventually people will run out of bitcoins to mine and there will only ever be 21 million in existence. Then the price will skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:15
Exactly. what have you go to lose at that point? Might as well buy more. That's what everyone else will be doing. Dollar cost average on the way down. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:30:41
Trade the range. No need to HODL. Buy every $300-$400 move. Make your 5%-10% and just do it frequently. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:17:25
Go look at the DOW overtime. Things always bounce back. You just can’t predict tops and bottoms. Bitcoin mining is very resource intensive. Video cards and memory and ssd prices seem to be dropping which means we are reaching a bottom where mining isn’t as profitable. It will eventually hit a floor I think and then bounce. It seems to be in a bit of a range right now and is going sideways.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:02
No No! This time is different!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:34
It's a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:46:23
Yeah this time is different. /s
This is just the next mania that won't end well. Go back to tulip bulbs. Go back to housing. Go back to stock markets. It's always the same. The price goes up because people think it will go up and so they buy more and hold it. Everyone is making money until there are no more suckers to pull in. It still has higher to go but it's not a sound long term investment. Too many volatile price swings. Once enough people get burned, it's days will be over. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:21
I called the housing bubble in 2005 and people told me the same thing. You're CRAZY!!!!
Here is the problem. It's software. It can easily be replicated. You could have something called Infinity coin using the same block chain technology. Yes, bitcoins have a finite amount but what is to stop someone from just creating a clone but better?
It would need some Government control to say it is official currency. If it's not, then what is to stop anyone else from creating a clone? This is a mania that won't end well. The music will stop and someone will be holding the bag.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:54:00
But you miss the whole point. Bitcoin is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. You need to convince more people to buy in. With the price plunging, that's going to be hard to do. I could understand if BITCOIN is all that there is, but it isn't. That is my point. What do you do when something comes along that is much better? 
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:18:47
I do believe lower BTC prices does lead to more efficient mining. Look at the effect lower oil prices had on oil drilling. It forced organizations to lower their costs or go out of business. It will actually incentivize them to be more green and efficient.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:47:37
The supply of money to buy digital currencies is finite. So yes, it does bother bitcoin. You can see it reflected in the price. As the supply of digital currencies has increased, the price of bitcoin has decreased. It's down 80% yoy in being used as an actual currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:21:39
There are many problems with the network - speed is one. Keep telling yourself “this time is different”. It’s just irrational exuberance.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:49:51
But but but bitcoins take a lot of resources to mine those 1’s and 0’s. That’s not free!!! And there will only be 21 million.
Ok, I absolutely get that, but how many digital currencies are there? While production is limited, there is a dogecoin, ethereum etc... with no sign of slowing down. And when someone invents a faster, more efficient coin, then what???
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:20:17
There is the definition of inflation and then there are the causes of it. 
While people focus on bitcoin and the supposed "limited" supply, one could then take your example and argue that the explosion of cryptocurrency in general causes inflation in the digital currency space. How many different *coins are there now?
While demand of bitcoin is structurally limited, the supply of cryptocurrencies in total (i.e., not just bitcoin) is infinite.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:56:59
Then why does BTC only support 7 txn a second? That is shit. There will be something much better. Lightning is just a bolt on. The whole thing will evolve into something that is far superior and just as secure (if not more secure). 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:06:00
Warren Buffet always said, “be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.”
Fear and greed drive markets. Everyone is scared shitless. If you believe in this, then buy more bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:46:42
I remember the housing bubble. “they’re not making more land, housing prices never go down etc...”
Dot com boom
“Everything is changing....”
Now this time “this time is different...”
Now I think over the long term crypto currencies will be valuable and actually used as a form of currency (like cash). Nothing moves in a straight line and I’m still not convinced it will be bitcoin. There could be something else that becomes the standard and wins out. Right now we are in an inflationary period of the number of digital currencies that exist.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:02:57
HODL HODL HODLGANG.
Cmon ya’ll. Don’t be selling. You should be buying on the dips. Experts are predicting $30,000 this year and higher. No need to sell out.
Meanwhile, I might unload a few and play the volatility game. We’re in a range.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:05:01
That's what I'm gonna do while everyone else just HODL's. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:11:14
He might be right. He said it was going in the toilet - it went in the toilet. Now he’s saying it’s gonna bounce out of the toilet. What don’t you believe?
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:57:08
How do you short it? There isn’t a market to “borrow coins” to sell.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:34:17
I got downvoted for telling people to use it as a currency instead of HODL. 
Is it a currency or is it something to HODL? I mean, I do save money but I don't expect the dollar to go up in value, so it is good as a currency and not really so good as a storage of wealth. With that said, it's a lot more stable than BTC, which is all over the place. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:33:56
They should charge a similar or lower rate than PayPal or credit card processors charge. At the end of the day, they just want to convert bitcoins to dollars. It’s too volatile for merchants to hold onto.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:03:59
Instead of hodling it, why don't you actually spend it and use it as a currency?
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:58:25
If you bought BTC a year ago, you would have paid $20000 and today it would only be worth $3500.
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:16:54
But people don't get it. Bitcoin is going to be in a limited supply unlike fiat currencies. You can't just create more bitcoins. Are their imitators? Sure, but this stuff is real and if you look at past patterns it's popped. Everyone is adding ETFs and it will soon be used as real currency if it already isn't. The technology behind it (blockchain) is a game changer. People won't have to transact with people and worry about getting ripped off. 
A friend of mine is a die hard bitcoin fan and this is what he tells me. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:44:23
Who is going to pay $20k for bitcoin? I know someone who needs it to get back to $20k so he can unload and break even. He said everyone needs to HODL. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:58:57
But how many different coins are there? While BTC is limited, there are more and more coins being created everyday. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:48:01
I'd like to know what planet you live on. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:22:59
Maybe he calls it Platinum and limits the supply to 10m coins and because it's more rare, it can be perceived as more valuable. Then you can have the fans of platinum arguing with the fans of gold about what is more valuable. They can point at the higher price and say "see."
Demand is structurally limited, but the supply of cryptocurrencies in total (i.e., not just bitcoin) is infinite.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:55:02
You are right, to a point. But for every Amazon, there were 99 other companies that went under. Amazon even hit a low and the point being, bitcoin could go much lower and if there is something better out there, then it could go extinct. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:07:14
People are losing confidence. When that happens, it loses value. It’s a negative feedback loop. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:09:56
Of course they do. You have to convince people it's going higher to make them believe they're getting it on sale. If not for those lofty predictions of $100k, do you think they would be willing to fork over $20k for it?
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:55:38
I think what he is trying to say is that this time isn’t different. Many manias end in a crash but then they settle when they hit solid ground. We saw this with the dot com bubble. We saw with the housing bubble. We are seeing it now. Dotcoms rebounded. Houses rebounded. This will surely rebound. No one knows how low it will go or how long it will last. If you believe, then keep buying. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:01:42
Yes. Risk assets are selling off. Gold is probably up. BTC is still viewed as a highly speculative asset. If it were stable (which many people don’t want, they want it to shoot up in value), then it might be perceived as a store of value (which many people want).
You can’t gave your cake and eat it too.

The Winklevoss twins and Warren Buffet. What about Bill Gates? Maybe someone should get Trump to buy in. You never know?

Does that mean it’s time to buy? Bitcoins and other cryptos will render fake money obsolete.

How smart is he? He bought when coins were cheap and convinced people to pay more. 
The question is, did the smart money cash out at $20k, and now they are back in at $6k and $7k?
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:05:20
Dollar cost average. Buy more here.

But if it does drop then he can say he told you so.

If everyone HODL's then the price has nowhere to go but up. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:28:08
Yep, why do people buy stocks, commodities, and bitcoins at the top of the market and sell at the bottom? That's not how you make money with any of this. FOMO screws so many people.

I wish you could buy put options. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:26:30
This is the way the market works. Things go up, things go done. Be a trader and don't get emotionally attached and you will be ok. No need to capitulate. You can't always win, you just need to win more than you lose to get ahead.
