These tens of thousands of people were eager to get on because of FOMO -  they saw this rocket go from $10K to $19K. I doubt, they just as eager now.

Link goes to http activityconfirmation chase com ?
It IS a valid chase address. It is not https because it is not asking you for any personal/senstive data.

The problem is - we don't know how deep this dip is going to extend. We've seen 50% down just a few weeks ago. Who's to say it won't go below $10K.  I think it is more prudent not to try and catch a falling knife, better to wait for it to stabilize and buy when it start coming back up.

To put things into perspective:
$10000-$11000: 1 day
$11000-$12000: 6 days
$12000-$13000: 17 hours
$13000-$14000: 4 hours
$14000-$15000: 10 hours
$15000-$16000: 5 hours
$16000-$17000: 2 hours
$17000-$18000: 10 minutes
$18000-$19000: 3 minutes
....and back down
$19666-$13000: 4 days
What's next?

Exit door is getting smaller. How soon will we see $100++ transaction fees?

How high can it theoretically go? A lot of people with 'get rich quick' mentality bought near $1K when media frenzy started.  They see it going 30% down from ATH and might decide that 1000%++ profit is good enough, time to bail. I guess, they will be willing to pay up $1K and more in fees as it is technically still 'house money'.  What will this do to smalltime hodlers with $100-$1000 balances?

Well, China might have been the reason for it going from $600 to $5000 in a year.  Who can guarantee it won't go back to $600 or lower just as easy.
