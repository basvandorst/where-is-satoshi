Yep, some where corrupt and some Recuva or EaseUs were unable to even detect they where there.
Using WinHex has a huge caveat for binary files: pieces of your files are scattered all around the hard drive, you have to put them together afterwards.
For a log file it doesn't matter, every line has a datetime and if you miss something in the middle it's ok, as long as what you need (an IP in my case) is there.
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:16:17
No, that's the only part I wasn't able to find out yet. I had no 2FA enabled, so that makes it easier I guess.
I hope that the guy mails me (he knows my mail, obviously :-) ) thanking for the 5 BTCs, returning the rest and giving me details. I know, I'm a dreamer :-)

Qt 0.9.3
Yes, reused pass at least one time between pieces involved (email, TV, wallet, my pc login...)
Always encrypted
Backups online and in cloud, wallet inside a 7zip AES encrypted (different pass)

Yes, stupid, I know.
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:44:45
No, never connected through TOR. As far as I know I've never given my TV id to anyone, less so publish online. With an email he can try to log into a teamviewer without knowing the id
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:20:46
I know. That's why I'm asking for help to find the guy, not any money or tips.
In fact: I DON'T WANT TIPS PLEASE.
PS: Also, I'm naive, so I have very little hopes that the guy is some kingd of Robin Hood that wants to warn people about how stupid they are and then send the Coins Back. Yes, I already said I'm stupid
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:48:20
It was running. I usually connect remotelly with my iPad. I though it was secure. SHIT.
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:41:27
Amazing little BAT script found at teamviewer directory:
sleep 60000
cd /d %~dp0
sleep 30000
del /F /Q TeamViewer9_Logfile.log
del /F /Q TeamViewer9_Logfile_OLD.log
sleep 3000
rd /s /Q c:\$Recycle.Bin
He forgot about Connections_incoming.txt thankfully

Of course not. You have to explain a lot of things. Most won't give you anything...
...And then some even ping you on Reddit.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:48:42
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:42:57
Probably yes, haven't tried (uninstalled TV :-) ). I'm behind a NAT router but since I could connect from the outside I guess that port forwarding was not necessary (uPnP?)
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:06:14
I have offline copies of my wallet, I got one transfer in this past week that I hadn't backed up yet, so the only place with that coins is my PC, and now they are also gone, so it was done from my PC fo sure (or copied from here these last days)
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:03:06
Cool. It was done while I was sleeping and the only PC with a wallet copy (that I know) shut down. I don't care about bitcoins anymore, I am an X-Man, so fear me.
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:18:52
Yes, it's mine, only 35.499 to go:
@_date: 2014-12-06 15:58:02
Imagine for a second that I recover the log files deleted from teamviewer. 
Still with me? Imagine Again that working with the TV guys + this logs info I'm able to get the ip of the guy. Now imagine that a VPN has not Been used.
It Could be funny posting the hackers info all around dark net letting people where to find a guy with lots of stolen bitcoins.
Cant happen? Maybe. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:30:11
It really doesn't matter if it's an VPN or other hacked computer. Having the IP + User Agent + Time spent on my PC with the same IP you can get a lot of info from multiple websites he visited that night if you have the contacts (or if they visit Reddit and offer assistance ;-) )
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:20:58
I generated a new address last week for a payment (0.4 btcs) and its also gone, are future generated addresses also there? Are they created from an existing seed?
I had Team Viewer, Im checking for logs  
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:41:40
More Details.
I know how he got the password to open the wallet, I still don't know how he got to log into the first in the "chain" of TeamViewer logins. Let me explain.
I've been able to recover most of the deleted files, including very interesting TeamViewer logs that I know now why he was so keen in deleting.
Among all deleted files was a nice little tool he downloaded named "ChromePass". With this tool you can see all stored password in chrome in the open (he even saved all in a TXT, I guess it was easier to cut &amp; paste). You can imagine that all my life was there, passwords for ALL kind of websites. The real dangerous had 2FA or required email access (which, by the way, he got) to do something like transfer money or buy things. 
He was careful as to use Private navigation with Chrome, but forgot about temporary stored images and cookie files in disk drive, I was able to recover a few, so I know some websites he visited from my PC, like BTC-e, Spanish speaking gaming websites, etc. Nice little list.
That list of password for hundreds of websites included the wallet encrypt password in a website I forgot I've ever visited. I guess I tried to login using that password (don't know why, maybe I was half sleep that day 2 years ago) and chrome stored that forever. Cool. 
He tried the passwords and was able to get my BTCs when he found the good one.
About TeamViewer, I won't give details, but I have a rough idea on the origin of the login (remember, I have the deleted log files), and you can recover files from all computers you have access to, so I have more info that I've ever though I would be able to get.
I know that the IP can be a SOUTH AMERICAN VPN or a wifi in a public university, etc, but I doubt it. As you can understand can't tell you why.
TO THE HACKER: You know that this is 99% true and the misleading 1% is there for you to prove who you are if you decide to contact me in the email you know.
I reiterate my offer: Keep 5 and send me back 35.5, I'm grateful for all the things I learned these days, and for not doing more harm on the places you had passwords to access and you didn't.
If you fear that somebody else could have compromised our "common" wallet you can send it to this fresh one:
I know you haven't stumbled my BTCs yet, and that you haven't send them to any of the major markets. There are not that many Stumblers that you can trust, if you can prove you have been hacked some are willing to help you. Same goes for Markets.
PS: For the rest of the guys out there; Run this ChromePass free util, you will be very scared after you do. 
If you have ever used TeamViewer to connect to your PCs from somewhere else's PC uninstall it now.
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:14:56
It will take forever, but fine with me:
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:11:49
Not my intention. I'm offering him 5 BTCs for his help in letting me know how stupid security (or insecurity) I had.
If I don't get the coins back from him I'll offer all info I have so somebody can profit for a guy that probably has hundreds of stolen BTCs.
@_date: 2014-12-13 10:00:58
No. That's why I always say that an IP is worth nothing.
It's the IP + User Agent + Timeframe + Login in other websites, all together, that matters.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:39:20
No warez, and no clicks on shady links. Anyway, it's a computer used for daily Internet access so anythink could have happened really.
BTW: Windows 8.1 always updated with latest patches.
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:28:12
They spent close to 2 hours on the PC. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:32:39
I'm working through it
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:51:20
Yep. I've found the transaction on my QT's db.log:
2014-12-05 01:51:33 CommitTransaction:
CTransaction(hash=343d79c291, ver=1, vin.size=13, vout.size=2, nLockTime=0)
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:30:36
Not a clue. I'd also like to know that :-)
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:14:21
Firewall disabled, into a network with NAT enabled, so hard to conect directly. 
No open port 8333, Teamviewer WAS installed (just removed it). 
Any ideas on how to check if the wallet.dat was transferred from my PC by any means? Any obscure Windows logs or something? 
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:46:39
TO THE HACKER:
I've reported your log from last nights connections, that you can find in this thread, to TeamViewer. They got back to me, I'll get the IP addresses and info from your conenctions.
If you are in a country with Law enforcement and didn't use TOR I'll go after you, even if it costs more than the 40 BTCs.
Contact me in the email address you know (the one you hacked into to connect to teamviewer) if you want this settled ASAP. You can keep 5 BTCs for helping me identify my security issues.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:05:00
Agree, that's why having his IP + User agent allows us to match him visiting other websites were he could be registered :-)
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:12:40
I warned that I don't WANT any tips. I haven't, and will not, collect them.
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:44:53
Thats it, I DO care About bitcoins and I'm sure it Will be a success. I was trying to be ironic. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:01:08
The address he/she is sending stuff to is this one:
He has got a lot of transactions that look like mine in the last 3 days, he is being VERY successfull it seems.
I already have a list of Addresses related to this one, any idea on how to track / investigate this?
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:41:20
TV guys are TeamViewer guys. I'm delusional, but not that much.
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:56:13
What are the transactions to/from BTCGuild, how can you identify them?
Please, let me know so I can write them with more concrete details.
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:12:42
Great, Thanks. I've just sent him a msg, lets ser if he can help.
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:06:27
It just deletes the log files from TeamViewer and makes sure that the Recycle bin is erased in Windows, that way all downloaded programs (like ChromePass) are deleted with the logs.
It was set up to run at each startup, so locked TeamViewer logs are deleted after he finished messing with my PC.
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:47:51
Yerterday it esas offline, but it seems it happened the night before. 
He used the teamviewer client and was very keen on delete references, with the help of teamviewer I think I can get something. Lets hope he is as stupid as me and didn't use a VPN :)
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:14:07
Two meanings, nothing related to the company:
Coinbase transaction is the one that pays the miner for each block.
Each Coinbase Transaction has a "coinbase" field, a Scriptsig for the block generation transaction (a random value. Some are very funny).
I guess that Coinbase (the company) used this name on purpose, is a great one.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:23:03
Please, don't send tips. Pleople will think I do this for them and that's not the case. I won't collect, them, ok?
THANKS ANYWAY.
@_date: 2014-12-06 15:43:57
No, no phrase or known words
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:06:33
It should say "Hola Reddit"
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:18:25
I don't want the IP to leak and the guy to get scared. Somebody can do the same things that I've done and have his data, don't want to open the hells gates for the guy.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:50:33
Scan finished, no malware detected.
SHIT. What the hell happenened
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:22:02
It was Bitcoin-qt , encrypted. Strong password (16 letters + numbers).
I guess it was a keylogger.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:18:58
Doubt it. Remember that I have more info still undisclosed about that IP
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:29:09
IT WAS TEAMVIEWER!!!!!!
I have connections from 2 nights ago while I was sleeping. My PC is locked when not in use, so they should already know my passwords.
Look at the connections:

Yes, an IP is nothing. If you can match that IP with an User Agent and a timeframe in an HTTP server log file you can find if the user was logged on any service of the web (mining in some pool, a forum, an exchange...).
After you have the user ID or nick name it's just a matter of googling.
Not to mention that those websites usually have emails, names...
@_date: 2014-09-09 10:28:35
That invoice is from 2013. 
I think it's IMPOSSIBLE that Satoshi used that email address to buy anything in 2013. Even in 2009 if he was so careful as to use TOR then for everything
