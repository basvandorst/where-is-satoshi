You don't even understand the issue. Maintenance and slow services are different than these assholes not responding for months disabling peoples accounts.

No good for US

you are fucking retard

Backtrack now if you want, telling folks to stop these shitposts.. you wouldn't say that if you were locked out of your money for over a month.

That doesn't work for most banks. I just tried and they can't cancel any transfers not initiated from their side.

Hey Alnewton,
I'm sorry I should of been more specific. I was speaking in terms of  of you getting your 2FA reset? I'm in the same boat..I can't access my funds currently because my phone died a few days ago. Had to factory reset. I got the 48 to 72 hours email after I did the driver's license web cam thing.... Now I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs....
I was asking how was your experience after this post in terms of support. Did someone call you or email you.. and tell you.. you were good to go? Did you have to talk to support and convince them? Etc...I just want to see what you had to do to get back in... Can you tell I'm nervous? Lol

That'll Teach me to be impatient! ��Lol
hopefully this will all be over soon. I'll be calling then today with my ticket#

Strange, I received that email that my account was verified but when I log in nothing has changed. However if I try to go through my account verification again it says wait 48-72...  
I guess I just wait...!!! Oh I Love this.... Smh

I gave up waiting. Moved on to the bread app. I can buy Bitcoin that way. I'll get to coinbase when they are finally not swamped but I look at that money as like 401k, can't touch it

It's been 14 days, what has been your experience?
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:23:47
Yes... But *sigh*
I got froggy and reported possible compromised account. Didn't realize they'd temporarily disable my account. Currently waiting for then to turn back on.. what's bad is within this same timespan I did receive notification my 2FA has been reset ��.
Literally just waiting for them to enable

Hello, did this ever get resolved for you? Did you hear back from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:34:12
Has anyone actually had their account reovered?
I went through the process of account recovery to login via web browser and saw that my old 2FA was still there and no way for me to remove.
