It's absolutely possible. They could also easily make it illegal to use crypto for currency exchange, or make it illegal to use for international exchanges etc. 
People say it's anonymous and they can't track you. Although this is true for the most part. News of this would cause enough people to lose hope and not want to get involved out of fear. This would kill the market.

You should pay your taxes on your crypto. Not doing so is foolish and you will be caught. Don't fully k with the IRS. If you don't like the legislation then vote to elect officials who represent your viewpoints (Thomas Massie, Justin Amash, Ron Paul, etc)
I mean I guess you could buy Bitcoin with cash and get away with it. I'm not advocating for that though. Just saying. 
If you want empty to grow we can't have everyone coming across as tax evading criminals.

Extinction? Soon? Ok calm down. 
I agree, the laws suck and govt is stealing from us. But we still have the ability to vote. Until that goes away I don't see the need for all out anarchy.

Since when does govt care about your rights? They don't. 
If crypto wants to have a chance then people need to be taught how to use Tor and other ways to use Bitcoin aside from main stream exchanges.
