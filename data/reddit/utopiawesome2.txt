This is a common but untrue misunderstanding people have, having all nodes as data centers actually goes back to the original vision of bitcoin. It seem clear you have never read through Satoshi's blog posts, emails, etc; I recommend it to get an idea of what he was thinking at the time.
Satoshi said that all nodes should be data centers (at a time when both full nodes and miners were the same machine), and nothing has really changed from why he suggested that would have to be the future other than some widespread attack against the idea of large nodes in teh future (but it has to be to maintain the original ideas)
lol this kills me, we rejected 2mb a year ago for not being enough, then everyone who use to be here was banned and now 2MB is too much, I don't know if everyone hwo comments here is completely uneducated on the matters at hand or what
the 2mb stopgap measure was what BIP102. it was to keep us from where we are today while we worked out a long term scaling, but I think somepeople don't really want btc to scale though I can't find out why.
I think you should spend more time looking things up before you talk about them

Some thoughts from me:
fractional reserve is possible with btc now is it not?
wouldn't a fully trustless 2-way-peg solve 
The bitcoin blockchain is likely able to scale beyond Visa size but it would take a number of years and would have to stay cloaser to Satoshi's idea of all miners *and* nodes being hosted in large data centers. But with the increase in technological abilities always increasing this may happen sooner than we think, however it won't happen right now and we need some sort of stop-gap mesure for the next few years until LN/sidchains/seg-wit/ and other things are actually operational

Okay well for 1 bc.i is known to have created bad keys in the past, problems with the RNG/reusing k values or something like that. So if the coins were put on a key made by bc.i they are potentially at risk.
it is unlikely but your phone might get stolen and 2fa subverted
This is part of the problem in general, you don't know how secure the key generation was probably, but you can be more sure of security on your own controlled machines. 
You can create a bip38 encrypted secret key and store that all over, give it away as long as your pass phrase is good enough.
The other risk you have is one that won't go away, having info around that someone could in theory gain access too, that's why encrypting your secret key is a good idea.
But let me ask you another question, if the operators of both of those websites turned the servers off, could you access your bitcoin? If not, then you have the promise of btc, but not the actual btc itself.
You've got good security in mind, why not do it right? Create a secure offline cold storage paper wallet that is bip38 encrypted, you can encrypt it further if you want. engrave that on a few pieces of aluminium and you're all set; just don't die without sharing that pass phrase

Satoshi was okay with datacenter nodes when he thoughts they were miners too, why can they not become large on their own? 


This is not what I read in the whitepaper, this is not what I read in Satoshi's words. That is not what got me into bitcoin. So why do you get to decide it, what is your reasoning?
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:34:09
But if Satoshi envisioned Btc with nodes being miners, he was okay with them being large datacenters that anyone could start up if they could afford to do so. Just because miners are no longer like that, why shouldn't nodes eventually be like that too?

@_date: 2015-12-01 00:32:02
It's not that I can't but what I envision is a world where instead of just the large datacenters that S.N. mentioned, which will act as nodes, there will also be big businesses of miners, which are what he envisioned nodes being also. In that case, I can't afford to do so, like I can't buy a car dealership.

Gosh really? I thought it was middle school grade, using their opinion as evidence and then tries to base more opinions on that 
OP is a trader and into it to make money, I notice how everyone who has that opinion also tends to have a massive lack of understanding of bitcoin and the history of it. 
It was BIP102 that was *just* an increase to 2MB, not classic,


massive lack of understanding and reasoning on the part of the OP here, using the word obvious when I saw the evidence disagrees, here we see OP using their opinion as fact and basing things on their own opinion. This is known as bias and it's not a good sign of strong writing or understanding. 
Yes, some former leaders like greg have spend a huge amount of time spreading misinformation and confusion but to what ends? WHo has put out clear and consice posts to highlight things in a fully descriptive and factual way (Gavin)?

@_date: 2016-06-30 01:06:26
Well that is why Satoshi envision all nodes being run in big data centers, and before you start on that BS about all nodes were miners then think about what you are saying.
SN was okay and aimed for all nodes, full node and miner, to be run by data centers in countries all around the world.
Bitcoin cannot exist for every Joe to run a full node, that was never part of the original plan and it doesn't make much sense when you think about it. Sure btc was designed to be P2P at first but that isn't the long term design for a good reason.
More use likely means more nodes by bigger companies all over the world.
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:48:02
The posting of facts and citations that refute you have in the past led to comments being removed and users being banned. We all know and have seen Satoshi's post on ***how the blocksize should be raised when hit***.
No one is urging people to do whatever you are talking about, that is silly and saying it makes you almost as silly as not being able to understand the motives and intentions behind [his comment]( on the matter.
It doesn't matter what *your opinion* on this matter is, it is very clear Satoshi made bitcoin with the idea in mind that the blocksize would never be a limiting factor.
Please tell me you at least understand that many people agreed with such as approach, and that is the Bitcoin they read about and understood, that is why many people are upset at the decisions that don't reflect that original thinking.

Oh, this is only the beginning.
With the article a few days ago where some bank said they planned to release a digital form of their currency in Fall 2017 with ATMs for it out by Spring 2018 I see other banks jumping on this ship quickly.
Banks originally all had their own paper certificates (cash), where one bank might not trust anothers'. Banks have basically now digitized this model with all having their own databases, as long as they can't agree to one database or blockchain between them there will always be problems with friction that btc can do better with

As to you C_, at the time of SN's writing that all nodes were also miners.

Hmm, not sure what you're getting at. It seems like you might be saying that early adopters have huge amounts of btc but that isn't quite how this worked out. 
For the first year it may have been primarily Satoshi mining, but all those addresses themselves only held a small (50+) number of coins. THen it takes time to accumulate coins even at 50 per reward so only some people ended up with large amount as most people mined and turned off or stopped running the program after only a little while, even when pc mining was 'profitabe' (there was no exchange rate back then)

Well let's think about it this way. If governments are moving their own digital currencies to electronic forms, then they would need to research many options to find the best one. Also in this case it is likely crytpos that are not tied to any state will continue to exist.
Now with these two ideas that we are taking as fact we can see that there may be many options to choose from in the future, so what makes something used or popular? Either is had features that other things don't that enough people want, or it was already popular and continues.     
Until something better comes out, any attempt to release another crypto that has more restrictions than bitcoin may only cause people to gravitate towards bitcoin as they see it is easier. This can be combated by associating btc with nasty things or making it illegal. 
So, IMO this is good for bitcoin because these things will very likely have more restriction and be harder to use than btc, for the time being.
