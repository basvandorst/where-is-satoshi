Apple, Microsoft,  and bitcoin...one of these is not like the other. It's kinda insane to even compare them. Two of them have tangible quantifiable value based on something...

You forget that the rich person usually has a lot of built up contacts/advantages and can more easily rebound. Depending on your level of wealth you may have declared bankruptcy, but you probably still own things that aren't going to suddenly be taken away from you. Hell, at this point you probably passed on some of that wealth onto your immediate family and you can probably use them for financial help. Compare that to a regular person who declares bankruptcy. They probably have nothing to their name, or are in such a deep hole that their normal income won't get them out of it anytime soon. It's not an apples to apples comparison.

In that respect doesn't that mean all it takes is a serious player to shut it down?
