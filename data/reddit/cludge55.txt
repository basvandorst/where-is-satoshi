I've always liked Schiff, but I couldn't help but notice how he kept interrupting. It shouldn't matter, but it made him appear defensive and consequently less persuasive.  Stefan on the other hand was cool and collected the entire time.

You can use QuickCoin to send via Facebook.  
I've had an account and sent BTC to FB friends.

How will this impact changes to the bitcoin protocol, e.g. block size limit?  Will 21, Inc.-supplied chips be "stuck" with the protocol at the time they are manufactured or would they be able to be updated remotely?

Bought some at $815, right near the low.  Good (lucky) timing so far...

Had to google it to know what you were referring to.  Now I understand.

What I find interesting is the guy that cites his trust in fiat currency is that there are institutions and rules (laws) in place that inform him about how much money is printed.
What's more trustworthy than a fully transparent, open source, distributed protocol like Bitcoin?

I've already done this gifting some BTC to my brother and sister.  I bought some in late September/early October, so just gifting them a fraction of my original purchase was a very small percentage but a nice chunk of change for them.  I told them to treat it like a savings account.  Used Coinbase's service to email BTC to others.

I'm not a lady, but I just ordered something for my wife.  Thanks for posting your site.  Oh, and I paid with BTC!

Also search "coinkite" and "coinbase" - they seem to have pretty good merchant services as well.
