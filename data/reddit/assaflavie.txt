For comparison, if I copy the block files from the other machine onto the external SSD and run the raspi node with `-reindex` the rate of progress is indeed much higher, and the CPU utilization is closer to 100%, as you would expect.
I have a hunch that it's simply not parallelizing downloading and indexing, which is why it's taking so long. Clearly, when it's doing *just* indexing, the CPU goes to work. But when it's both downloading and then indexing it's probably doing thing serially: waiting for DL IO, then indexing, then DLing the next block. Need to have a look at the code to be sure, but that would probably explain the poor utilization at least to some degree.

Possible. How would I test this hypothesis?
Remember, also, that this single peer is a machine on the same ethernet LAN connected with a Gb switch. So unless there's explicit throttling (not aware of such a switch in `bitcoin.conf`) I can't really explain how it's only downloading so slowly.

How do we know that mining cost / transaction is expected to converge to a level that allows micro-transactions? (e.g. &lt; $0.01)
Aren't fees expected to go up as rewards go down? Is there an assumption here that the number of transactions / block will rise by orders of magnitude?
And even assuming the mining market would converge on low fees at some distant point in the future - are there any real prospects for BitCoin as a micro-transaction platform in the *near* future?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:08:59
First, LiteCoin is a PoW protocol, just slightly less hw-accelerated (ATM). So that's probably not the answer. If it becomes popular enough it'll suffer the same fate of high fees.
More importantly, I don't see how an alternative coin is a solution to the above concern. If BitCoin isn't suitable for MTs then people shouldn't be touting it as such. This seems to be an inherent problem with PoW currencies, not something that can be fixed with a tweak to the hashing algorithm.

It seems that as long as the protocol fights spam with minimal fees it can't be compatible with micro-transactions.

I agree that the graph tracks closely the true cost to the miners, otherwise room is left to invest more in mining resources and competition means the margin should approach 0, as I believe it does (mining is just barely profitable right now). 
I'm not sure about it tracking electricity costs, though. I think that with the rate of mining rig development these days the cost of HW is an order of magnitude higher than the cost of juice.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:58:20
LiteCoin is only cheaper because it is less popular. Mining cost converges on market value of reward minus a tiny margin of profitability. 
I get that it's programmable money. But until someone explains to me how to program it to allow MTs without breaking it completely (i.e. spam, reduced security) I'm under the impression it's just not suitable for MTs, despite the fact that it's one of the most popular advantages people associate with it.
BTW, how micro? Fractions of a cent. Small enough to allow a new business model for page-views, content subscriptions, etc.  - all the good stuff we were promised. :)

1. The scarce commodity on the blockchain is size (bytes). You can only fit so many transactions because of the limit on block size. Thus, miners charge fees per bytes to get your transaction "on chain".
2. The scarce commodity on the LN is channel balance. Each channel is created using an on-chain transaction with a given bitcoin balance on both sides. If your LN transaction is going to spend a channel's balance, that channel would have to be closed and reopened (on-chain) in order to rebalance it. That costs money (on-chain fees). So the channel operator is rationally going to charge you per the amount of bitcoin you're "costing" them in balance. Very different from charing you per byte. Bytes are cheap on the LN (practically no cost), but balance is scarce. So a profit-seeking channel operator on the LN will charge fees proportional to the size of the transaction in Bitcoins (not bytes).  
This is a very simplistic description of the incentive structure, of course. If you're opening a long-term channel with some node with which you're transacting back and forth directly, for example, then there shouldn't be any fees at all. It's just network traffic basically.

Block downloads should really happen over a secure connection, like HTTPS. There was a proposal recently to tackle this (and also reduce bandwidth at the same time by tweaking the serialization iirc). DLing the entire blockchain over Tor just to hide the content being downloaded from inspection by the ISP is ridonculous.

How would that be helpful?
If you're time sensitive, then you have no choice but to transmit now and adjust the fee accordingly.
If you're not time sensitive, then just transmit with a low fee and let it wait in the mempool for a drop in the volume (there are typically multiple troughs every day).

To expand on this a bit. I think OP's asking about sending addresses, but really means maintaining privacy.
While it's very true that each tx using a modern wallet would have a different address (likely a change address of the previous one), those are highly linkable to each other. This is why others have suggested using Wasabi (coin join) to increase privacy, and this is a good piece of advice.
For the privacy focused I would also recommend:
1. Using your own full node with Electrum Personal Server to transact. You can use a 2-of-2 multisig wallet with Trezor if you're looking for the extra security.
2. Use Tor browser for everything Bitcoin related.
3. Keeping track of clean vs "dirty" UTXOs by storing them in separate wallets. And periodically "clean" the dirty UTXOs with Wasabi.

That bar owner, by setting the fees on the channel you open with them high, has simply increased the price of all transactions with their shop. Not a very rational, profit-maximizing approach, as there are many other coffee shops. 
The arguments about centrality stem from the fact that unlike on btc itself, LN relies on intermediary routing nodes to transact, and they will likely operate in a way that maximizes profits. To compete with other nodes you need to sacrifice liquidity (i.e. be rich) for fees. You need to know the network topology better than your competition in order to open the “best” (most profitable) channels. That takes effort and money and is somewhat reminiscent of algo trading. A game for large holders of money. 
Of course this is purely theoretical and it is unclear to what degree the network will be centralized and how problematic that degree turn out to be. 
Anyway, that’s at least one argument I know. I personally don’t put as much weight in it, because I think the same forces that make miners be sufficiently decentralized apply here (commoditization). 
@_date: 2019-04-17 04:39:50
Hard to argue with that. I’m not actually sure it is an unpopular opinion. The BSV saga was an example of a coin that was decreasingly economical to list, and then the popular outrage against its proponents simply tipped it over. Who wants to list a crappy chain requiring a zillion confirmations and possibly disproportionate support cost with a tiny trading volume? ����‍♂️ Seems impractical to me.

Liquidity just means being able to you your money freely. If your money is locked up in a channel, it’s not “liquid”. You can’t use it / spend it unless you close the channel (cost). This is the scarce resource of the LN. In btc the blockchain’s scarce resource is bytes. In ln the scarce resource is coins that are allocated to channels and thus are not spendable outside those channels.

The more people use coinjoins the less economically feasible it is to censor transactions based on history.

The definition of being a millionaire varies, depending on your location and currency.
e.g. obviously being a millionaire in JPY does not mean you have more than JPY 1M.
It's also not really the way the term is used in the states. A millionaire is more like someone who has a few million dollars of liquidity, and not just someone who's net worth exceeds $1M.

You don't have to transport bitcoin through airports...
it exists on the blockchain, and you just have to know the private key. The challenge is then to transport 264 bits of information (typical seed phrase) through an airport. If you can't think of 12 different ways of doing that without being caught, I'd be surprised. (hint: memorizing 24 words ain't that hard). It's orders of magnitude easier than getting any physical item through customs.

What are you thoughts about leaking identity data via sending out coinjoined utxos from Wasabi in the same block?
If a user enqueues 1 BTC, and it takes a few hours for these funds to be coinjoined (in ten different joins), those funds stay in Wasabi for quite a while, typically, until the user withdraws them to their general-purpose wallet (e.g. trezor). But the fact that 10 coinjoined utxos (likely from consecutive coinjoins) are being sent out in 10 different transactions on the same block gives a non-trivial indication that they're going out to the same holder. The timing of the "withdrawal" from Wasabi can leak a user's identity, and the size of the leak is inversely proportional to how many other participants withdrew at the same time. 
One way I can think of to improve on this, and possibly improve the UX of the wallet as well, is to pre-schedule withdrawals of all participants funds to non-wasabi addresses in the same block. e.g. the block immediately following the coinjoin. In terms of UX, it also eliminates the inevitable step of taking your funds out of Wasabi (I assume more Wasabi users just use it for coinjoins and not to hold/transact normally). As a user, I'd have to not just enqueue the funds, but also provide the target addresses for them (enough to send each utxo separately). But that's something users end up doing anyway - might as well allow them to do it ahead of time, no?
Naturally this problem goes away if there are enough coinjoins going around, because the chances of withdrawals occurring in the same block go up, thus increasing the anonymity. But a the current scale (not many / day), the leak might not be negligible.

I think it's a clever algorithm. Not sure how well it would operate in an adversarial setting like BTC/LN. What stops nodes from spamming "pheromones"?
I'm also not quite clear on how this scales, since it's yet another broadcast solution, where the worst case performance is every routing request gets sent to every node in the network. Which is related to the spam issue, too. **There has to be a cost to routing**, or otherwise the system is easy to spam/DDOS.
A bit similar to how Bitcoin has mining fees to combat block spam (since on-chain space is the scarce resource), perhaps LN needs routing fees, to combat routing spam. Liquidity isn't strictly the **only** scarce resource on the LN - bandwidth is, too.

So juvenile. It's not as if BTC supporters claim that fees would remain low as activity continues to grow. The correct response to "BTC fees are too damn high!" is "jealous??". The on-chain price is proportional to the value the bitcoin network provides in securing an uncensorable ledger. Fees are a feature, not a bug. This is the cost of having hard money. If you want cheap, censorable payments in an inflated currency, you already have paypal - no need for crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:41:09
But what’s a bad actor? A node that just tries to find a route,and failing, can be retrying in a loop, and seem like a spammer. 
I suspect a cost has to be built into the routing protocol. e.g. each node visited by the “ants” gets one satoshi. There are already channels in place for this (by definition). just spitballing, this is clearly naive.

Good stuff. In a related note, I was thinking how would one go about generating a valid seed phrase manually, without a computer. Aside from just generating the entropy (dice?) there's the pesky matter of getting the checksum right. Any ideas how to tackle that? Doing sha256 by hand is no fun.
