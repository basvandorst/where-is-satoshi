The block size limit is a limit on the supply of a product. So changing it absolutely changes the economic incentives. The argument put forward about encouraging a fee market explicitly acknowledges this. The segwit subsidy is also a planned economic incentive *intentionally, by design*. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous.

@_date: 2016-04-11 09:43:32
Most classic supporters like segwit. I believe the arguments against are something like
- it would be cleaner as a hard fork
- as a soft fork, it breaks some wallets (negating benefits of a soft fork to some extent)
- excessive code complexity compared to other fixes for malleability
- subsidy for using segwit is not in the spirit of bitcoin
Segwit vs 2mb hardfork is a false dichotomy.

Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of genuine respect for Back, Cohen, Maxwell and Szabo. But the expertise of Back and Maxwell (or even jstolfi) lies in cryptography and coding whereas the fundamental innovation of bitcoin is as much in the economic incentive system and engineering compromises chosen as it is in the computer science.
If you evaluate it purely from a crypto/cs approach you come to the  conclusion it doesn't work and is insecure and can't scale. And they are right in a sense; it requires effort in linear proportion to break (majority hash power attack) meaning it's cryptographically insecure.
But it fucking works.

Early 2011. I read Satoshi's paper. I walked around in a daze for a few days. I could think of nothing else.
Honestly, I thought governments would all-out assault it. Perhaps they will catch on soon. I still think it is kryptonite to the banking system and in the long run, the nation state. It is, more than anything else, an outright revolutionary political creature.
I realised its importance because:
* Having observed bittorrent, I knew it could not be shut down
* Having observed (and to an extent, predicted) the financial crisis, I understood the nature of debt-money pretty well, so I understood the need for something like bitcoin
* I had been looking for some kind of community-owned equity-based money
* I had tried to send money to wikileaks, and they were extra-legally blockaded
* It is equity-based money that requires no intermediary to send (*unlike gold*) disintermediates the banks directly
Bitcoin is the most socially important invention I have seen since the internet. Nothing else comes close. Money is the essence of politics.

Positive real interest rates (your latter scenario), which are the marginal real cost of debt, **are** normally used as the primary monetary tightening tool (i.e. to reduce aggregate demand and thus lower inflation). The pro-central bank argument against bitcoin simply rests on the idea that this tightening or loosening should be manually managed rather than left to float. 
The current problem is that central banks cannot increase aggregate demand any further by lowering interest rates because interest rates are already nearly zero. Because of the huge debt overhang (what Bernanke euphemistically calls 'excess savings' since one man's debt is another man's savings in our debt-based system) the marginal return for most is to pay down debt rather than invest. In the current (possibly post-) crisis environment, the real return on marginal investment is less than the interest rate required to borrow for the investment. So nobody wants to invest, but instead pay down debt, causing a spiral. Hence central banks are, in desperation, directly trying to manage the quantity of central bank base money by monetisation of debt as an alternative to negative interest rates. The problems with both normal and exceptional scenarios are obvious.
A counterpoint would be that Singapore pegs their exchange rate (price of exchange-money) instead of controlling interest rates (the price of borrowing or debt-money).
Interestingly, Keynes' proposed decrease in spending due to better marginal return on hoarding (paradox of thrift) is in direct contradiction to the wealth effect that Bernanke used in justification for QE (increase in spending due to rising nominal net worth) -- the same explanation bitcoiners sometimes use to explain the increased spending observed with rising bitcoin price.
As an aside, a lot of what gets described as 'Keynesian', like the bullshit that Krugman talks, really isn't. For instance, Keynes advocated a monetary standard based on a basket of commodities. Keynes was friends with and spoke well of Hayek (though I think he was equally overrated).
RockyLeal posted a great debunking, based on what Keynes actually said, here:

I'm quite surprised to hear from this thread that I'm an 'early adopter'. For me an early adopter was someone who bought in 2010. I suppose an early adopter is always someone who bought in before you did.
In 2010 or early 2011 I googled "open source money" and "debian money" because I was butthurt about the financial crisis (still am) and I thought we needed a stateless free currency. I read the description of the debain bitcoind package ('...create currency directly on your computer' or similar) and thought it was stupid because there was no limit to issuance. Eventually I read Satoshi's paper and I walked around in a daze for a few days. I think it will come to be seen as one of the most important papers of the last 100 years, along with Shannon's 1951(?) paper, the structure of DNA etc. Big ideas in that paper, crystallised.
Anyway, I didn't install the client when I first heard about it because the satoshi client was windows only and I didn't want to install windows. (not sure if this memory is congruent with the bitcoind memory -- perhaps something's out in my timeline).
So I am not a millionaire because I didn't want to install windows.
I allocated about 5% of my net wealth at $10 and $6. GPUs were becoming a 'thing', but you needed an ATI card and I had nvidia. It was cheaper to buy than mine then, so I bought. I had to restrain myself from buying more. Bitcoin is a much less risky bet now. I bought through bitcoin-otc (which involved sending bank transfers to a complete stranger, for a trustless currency!) Later I bought more through intersango. I was impressed how the price recovered after the first goxxing and the bitcoinica hack, so I bought more. I realised then that it was strong enough to survive. That was the most painless bitcoin purchase I ever made. I miss intersango. I lost a small amount in the final goxxing.
I bought the laptop I am writing this on for 11 BTC when it was about $100. I have never withdrawn cash from an exchange, though I have short-term traded (i.e. punted) a bit. I might cash out a few % if we reach $5k, if I can't spend enough.
I bought some more at $176 on the way down after the bubble before the last. If there's one observation I would make, is that the bubble cycle repeats more or less the same, every time so far.
The most valuable thing bitcoin has given me, is detachment from money. I regularly see my wealth double or halve in a few days or weeks, and now I feel nothing.
I lost a big chunk of my bitcoins on ASICminer shares. While up in national currency terms, that bet cost me big in BTC. Overall, bitcoin is now a sizeable fraction of my wealth, and I am comfortable with that. My life has not changed much compared with what it would have been otherwise. Except, I spend too many evenings reading and thinking about bitcoin. This, too, shall pass.
Bitcoin has been the best investment I have ever even heard about, but I still think its main interest is socio-political. So much of our society, hierarchy and production is organised around our money system, trust, and preserving chain of title. Bitcoin speaks to that.
Bitcoin is a knife to the heart of the dragon. The blow has been struck by Satoshi. I am amazed bitcoin was not crushed.
By the original measure of my first hopes, bitcoin has already won.

TL;DR of paper 1:
* decentralised ledger is a major innovation in the field of transactions, the last being double-entry bookkeeping in C16.
* decentralised ledgers eliminate credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
* Thus they are more efficient *and* more robust.
* As with money held as bank deposits, most financial assets today exist as purely digital records. This opens up the possibility for distributed ledgers to transform the financial system more generally. (e.g. coloured coins).
The article is thorough and accurate.

“There is no clear evidence from experience that the investment policy which is socially advantageous coincides with that which is most profitable...
Finally it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is in the essence of his behaviour that he should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”

The most obvious use is to notarise wills etc. See e.g.  which indelibly proves the existence of an electronic document (e.g. a will) at a certain time by embedding its hash in the blockchain. Since the hash is basically unique to the document, the document cannot be altered.
The next most obvious use is for indelible chain of title. For example, proof of existence could be used to tie legal title deed to an asset to a coloured coin or counterparty asset (counterparty.co). The blockchain would then record the transfer of that title effectively incorruptibly. Such a decentralised solution would avoid corruption of the chain of title as occurred with MERS for housing in the US (resulting in banks foreclosing on the wrong houses, for example, see  Also it would make asset forfeiture through forgery of title impossible, or at least difficult (as happens in some countries with poor rule of law).
If you then marry these functions with the smart contract ideas that are floating around (but not realised) you can generate transactions (such as distribution) that execute based on conditions set by an oracle. But this is a bit further into the future, whereas the other ideas can already be executed.
These are just examples off the top of my head.

TL;DR of paper 2: 
A well-argued point from paper 2:


However they then make a wrong statement that the increasing hash rate per address is indicative of rising tx fees in real terms. It seems to neglect the increasing efficiency of ASICs.
There is also the usual argument about bitcoin's fixed supply being unable to respond the changing demand for money resulting in volatile price of money (e.g. price deflation).
They seem quite worried about a 51% attack.


The paper also explores the possibility of a bitcoin-denominated 'free banking' system arising.

You need to define what variable is scaling for this to have any meaning.
Even if everybody transacts with everybody else, then the
    tx added *per new user*  ~ n
i.e. is O(n).
Looking at total transactions, which gives *at worst*
    total tx ~ (n)^2
(where n is number of users) is meaningless, because *total* bandwidth goes as n also.

Nope, Keynes advocated commodity money, the bancor as he called it. He didn't like gold for that purpose because it got more valuable in recessionary times. By linking money to industrially required commodities the idea was that easing would be automatic in those times and money would be tighter in boom times. A lot of modern bullcrap gets falsely attributed to Keynes.

@_date: 2016-01-25 12:59:51
because there is a marginal cost to the miner. E.g. orphan cost due to propagation lag.
Consider the following: If you disagree with me, and think that capping supply would raise total fees collected, why would the miners not collectively decide to do that with a soft limit? If your answer is that in a competitive environment, fees will be driven down, and that a non-competition-based cap is necessary, then you are saying a cartel is a requirement for bitcoin's success. In my opinion, if that were true, bitcoin would have failed. A centrally planned bitcoin is not the bitcoin I signed up for.

Many of those 6 billion.
On your other point, I don't believe 2MB will cause centralisation to datacentres any more than is already occurring. If I did, I would oppose it. I think it is a lie repeated enough that people have started to believe it. We have had 1MB for years and 2MB is less even than the increase in bandwidth.
What I object to most is the paternalistic attitude of a subset of devs -- the Core devs -- to decide for everybody else. And I don't buy the argument of 'experts'. Arguments should stand on their own feet and I have heard all sorts of contradictary shit come out of their mouths. The only consistent argument I've heard is that they want to force a fee event, and I think it's way too early for that.
This doublespeak about 'consensus' is obfuscation: the only consensus that matters is the one defined by the majority of the hash power. which is *the whole fucking point of bitcoin*. (this last bit was not really directed at you personally...)

It proves we pull off a hard fork and it demonstrates where the power lies: in the hands of those who have invested the capital; the miners, holders and businesses. Whereas, forcing a premature fee market by a supply quota is going to cause demand destruction and is, in a sense, an attack on the miners.

I have seen no convincing evidence that a rise to 2MB will increase centralisation. Adam Back proposed 2-4-8. Even the Core team have admitted that.

That's much clearer, thank you. For clarity, and if you have the time, I am not sure I follow your extrapolation from one full node to many.
I can see that if I run a full node I can validate to chose the longest valid chain, but from my node operator's perspective, the other non mining nodes are just relays right? So the only difference to the vanilla Nakamoto consensus is that non mining nodes can refuse to relay an invalid chain?
If that's what you are saying it's not controversial at all. Except that if one apparently invalid chain (to relay nodes) grew much longer, then relay nodes would have to switch to the longer chain because that would be where the security investment and the transaction processing capacity was. Also, I would assume that miners (sans relay nodes) are pretty well connected since they have a commercial interest in receiving blocks first hand.

This is a fallacy, as a little thought will reveal to you. Supply is not unlimited. The cost will be driven down to the marginal cost of production. This is small(er) but non-zero. Miners will restrict block size by including as many transactions as is profitable. I.e. block size will be limited by the miners, as profit maximisers, without a production quota set by the devs.
Miners will act to maximise *the sum* of fees, which is not the same as raising the *minimum* fee. That is, your argument also neglects the demand side of the equation.

Once when the db format was changed, I forget the other time (very early I think). The db format upgrade was messy and a temporary chain split occurred due to an obscure bug in the earlier version.

I do not accept your premise that bitcoin cannot scale on chain.
In any case, I see no scenario where it becomes a settlement system where it is not first a payment system. Settlement and value are emergent and arise from use as currency.
edit: any system that is decentralised will have to scale at best roughly ~O(n) *per node*. This is acceptable to me. The promise of LN of sublinear scaling necessitates some centralisation (into hubs). That is fine, but not at the cost of a more decentralised system like bitcoin.

Keep your eye on the ball. My concern with tps is real, but secondary. My primary concern is that bitcoin development becomes more decentralised. That means competing clients and bips decided by adoption. That is why I run a btcd node.


I am happy with the idea of payment channels. What I am less happy with is:
1. Inconsistent arguments over a period of years to stall a blocksize cap HF. All sorts of contradictory arguments have been wheeled out. A year or two ago it was 'we can hard fork easily when the time comes; no need to plan now'. Now it is 'a HF is dangerous and will take a year of planning'.
2. LN without sufficient discussion of other, simpler, payment channel solutions. Lack of appropriate BIP for discussion.
3. delay of HF short-term fix before LN or other payment channel solution is *actually ready*
4. excessive, unnecessary complexity of core roadmap proposed solution
5. insufficient consideration to non-core proposed BIPs
6. borderline sociopathic / immature behaviour of a subset of devs (nullc, Todd, Hearn), particularly those who have not made material contributions to code (btcdrak).
7. infiltration of a (small) set of known scammers into the core social structure (btcdrak - viacoin, thermos- btctalk donations). Continuing of the social attack via btcdrak attempted infiltration in /r /bt c and thermos' continued censorship. This comment will likely be deleted for instance. Ongoing pollution of good contributions by e.g. sipa.

@_date: 2016-01-25 14:47:37


It's an outside possibility. In which case, the argument of decentralisation requiring small blocks would be wrong... but that is a different discussion.


There is always a strictly positive marginal cost. It may be very small but it will be nonzero. Even at one CPU cycle. That should be something we aim for, in my opinion: a very efficient transaction system. High volume users who require security will always find it preferable to allow some fees to secure their transactions. Also, not all fees will be at the marginal cost: only the marginal transaction. Since the required fee may vary, someone who *absolutely requires* their transaction in the next block will pay over the market fee. *Price* is set at the margin, but *total fees* will be higher than price x (total txs).


It's difficult to know because miner behaviour is still dominated by block rewards, as designed to expand the network in its growth phase.

gmax's response to xThinBlocks was along the lines of 'meh, we have something similar, that is better in principle, but not implemented and we are not really working on it'. He then mumbled about the relay network a bit.
As I see it the relay network does something a bit different, and is not actively maintained. I don't see why xThinBlocks shouldn't be adopted by Core since it reduces block propagation bandwidth (a lot) and also latency. Since this was supposed to be a problem for people running their own relay nodes and the network in general I would have thought they would welcome it.
Not so, apparently.

@_date: 2015-08-15 15:47:51
Then logically it seems I agree with you; without the upper and lower bounding, side chains are not pegged at all and are just altcoins. However I had taken the two way peg as the definition whereas you are using your reading of the paper (reasonably). I haven't read the paper so can't comment on their  specification. However if the only actual  implementation does implement the double peg the question becomes what other possibilities are permitted with the system.
@_date: 2015-08-15 12:54:19
Sorry not fixed, but floored. If you lock up one btc to create a side chain, the value of that side chain is floored at one btc.
On the flip side, if you can then generate further coins in the side chain using bitcoin at the same ratio, then a ceiling is imposed also, making a fixed peg.
I haven't read the paper but had understood the latter is implemented also, based on an interview with Adam Back.
@_date: 2015-08-15 10:02:24

em.. yeah, thanks Satoshi. Whoever you are.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:03:14
OK, thanks for the reply. I think we are at the nub of my confusion about what you are saying.
What I think is missing from your scenario is economic value. The economic value would be destroyed by this (rather unrealistic) coordinated action from the miners, if it would alienate the user base. The economic value comes from the users as well as the miners, working in concert.


The same works the other way; the rogue miners would be left mining a worthless currency, that nobody would want to use. Bitcoins value derives in large part from its neutrality.
So if, in sum, you are saying that a majority of miners can trash the network, then I think most will agree with you. I don't think it's in the majority of miners' interests to do this. Ultimately, we are trusting in the economic self-interest of the miners. Bitcoin's robustness depends on this. How robust this is, remains to be proven. It's done quite well so far.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:31:49
Are you serious? Have you read the revision history of that page? Have you read and understood the white paper?
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:42:21


is dead right. A rebuttal will be wasted on you, but since you asked, on follows.










Polls don't matter. The whole point of bitcoin is that there is a consensus mechanism that doesn't rely on polling. It uses hashrate, representing capital invested. Even if you could do a poll, not everyone has the same stake in the outcome. How about weighting the poll by bitcoin owned? Congratulations, you've invented proof of stake.


Well it still is, no disagreement there.


bald assertion.


Partly true.


No. We can run any code we want and choose to follow the main chain or not. That is our own personal consent that determines our personal consensus. People run all sorts of versions of bitcoind and other implementations. You either follow the hashrate or not.

Yes, the majority hashpower can choose not to include a tx if it can maintain the longest chain. No, because there is still a nonzero chance that the minority hashpower will get the longest chain. But on expectation, yes, the majority hashpower can block a tx. Majority hashpower is far from "a miner" though.

This is wrong reasoning. While it will (in isolation) decrease fees *per transaction*, it does not follow that fees decrease *per block*. Also the converse is not in general true. Constricting block space supply and forcing fees to rise *per transaction* will not necessarily result in more fees *per block*. It depends on how fees respond to restricted supply of block space. The control of (block space) supply to maximise extraction of value (total fees), without destroying demand, is a non-trivial economic problem.

A fair question. Firstly, I am no philosopher, but will attempt to speculate on the reasons.
I think one of the things that attracts some people to left-anarchism is the idea that enforceable property rights are not compatible with non-violence. I.e. to own property you have to be able to deny the use of it to other people. In this sense, bitcoin is attractive because it permits property without requiring violence, based as it is on secrecy of your private key.

Exactly. Although, artificially constraining supply (like de Beers in the diamond trade) is fucking with a market.

That's just in blockchain.info's public notes system. Not actually in the blockchain itself.

I didn't say I had a solution. Actually, I think at this stage there is no solution.
On austerity, *before* it was tried, many people said that it would cause the economy to contract and would worsen the deficit and debt/gdp. This is what happened. So this is empirical evidence.
The theoretical reason is that
    private sector surplus = public sector deficit + net exports
and since Greece cannot devalue to increase net exports, reducing the deficit will not help increase the tax base or expand the economy. Austerity *might* work if Greece was not in the Euro, but it is, so it cant.
But you are right in that I am derailing the conversation, so I will desist at this point.

or 3. Wright *is* Satoshi, proved it to Matonis and Gavin, and is now attempting to make himself look like a fraud, rather than the real Satoshi.
Unlikely, but strictly possible.

Fees occur because the miner income per tx has to be higher than the marginal cost of including it. I don't see that you need a block size limit to induce fees. In fact, if restricting tx space were profitable for miners, they would limit block size voluntarily.

To be clear, it's probably best to do this by spending your importing your private keys into your new wallet on your new machine, then spending to a new wallet.
You should assume your windows machine is compromised and that entering your password might feed it to a keylogger.

You really think a pow change is less controversial than a 2mb cap?

Which would be completely reasonable.

I watched Disney's Aladdin last night. The way the evil characters were drawn really reminded me of the Nazi cartoons of Jews. Yet the good guys were drawn western looking. Nothing changes I guess.

You appear to struggle with logic, reading comprehension and analogies. Let me explain.
The problem is A, and B was tried. B failed and made things worse. You continue to advocate applying more B. I point out B failed. You accuse me of advocating C. In fact I never advocated C.
Now, let
- A be the large debt of Greece sovereign
- B be drastically reducing government spending, laying off state workers, privatising and increasing taxes
- C be, well, anything really.


No, I never said that.
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:01:12
so the miners *do* define consensus? In another thread you disagreed with me when I said this. Which is it?

Greece has cut spending dramatically but GDP contracted even more because of this. Debt to GDP got worse. You sound like the Irishman giving directions saying 'well, I wouldn't start from here...'

At their core, banks are experts / specialists at pricing risk (in this case, mostly default risk). Your proposition reduces to whether p2p is better at that business.

I agree that bitcoin is in the speck of dust phase. However the fact that bitcoin exists inside and outside of a country with a non-convertible currency will drive its adoption. Despite the poorly chosen title, that was my point.
