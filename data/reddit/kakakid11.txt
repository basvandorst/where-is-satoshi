i agree brother, bitcoin is a bubble and its popping by the end of this month
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:08:43
bitcoin didn't even get a big fork or get attacked hard, its just dying on its own, not even the big bang theory episode could save it. Bitcoin is dead...
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:44:21
there just so much odds against bitcoin, high rate to pop, altcoin replacement, corrupt exchanges, this is worse than things that happen to real money
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:10:54
tax going to be more than profit...
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:37:14
bitcoin is dead people are going to get fucked 10k was the peak and goal for most people, noones going to invest anymore
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:12:08
bitcoin has peaked already 10k was the goal for most people and now everyone is selling, noones going to buy anymore, bitcoin is done..
