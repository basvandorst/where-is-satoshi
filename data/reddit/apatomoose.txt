To take the analogy further, a persistent blockchain split can be considered reproduction. If the blockchain splits into multiple competing forks, each with some traits of the parent chain, and some new traits, it will start evolving. There is no telling what could develop from that.

Yes, once there are other places that accept Lightning payments then it will be practical to use. I was talking about the current case where TorGuard is the only place that accepts mainnet Lightning. See the first sentence of my comment above: "Until there are other people you can pay on LN I don't see the point of using LN for TorGuard."
I applaud TorGuard for being ahead of the curve and being the first to adopt what will be a revolutionary change in Bitcoin. I just don't think it will be a very useful application of Lightning until other merchants come on board.

A Lightning channel has a fixed total amount of bitcoin, divided up between the two people who share the channel. A payment is made by moving some of those coins from one side of the channel to the other. Any transaction that is larger than the amount of coins held on the relevant side of the channel is too large to go through that channel.
Payments can be routed through multiple channels in sequence to reach people who you don't have a direct channel with. Alice can pay Carol by paying Bob who pays Carol. But every channel in the route has to have enough capacity on the right side of the channel to transmit the payment. You could have a channel that has enough capacity, and still be unable to pay someone if you can't find any connecting channels with enough capacity.
The total capacity of the channel is chosen when the channel is opened. A higher capacity means the channel can be used for larger transactions, but it also requires more funds dedicated to the channel.
tl;dr How much is too much depends on how much money people are willing to dedicate to Lightning.

But then the person you share the channel with now has coins tied up in a channel that isn't doing anything. And they can't send those coins to anyone else through Lightning if you don't have a balance in another channel to route through. The best course of action in that case is to close the channel and free up the coins for something useful.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:03:41
You can do that. You have to have at least two channels so that people can route from one channel to the other through you. If you only have one channel then you are a dead end as far as routing goes.

A channel is an amount of bitcoin that is in a shared address between two people. They can make payments to each other by updating how big a share of those coins each person has. At any time either person can close the channel by publishing the latest balance update as a transaction on the blockchain, and each person can claim their share of the coins.
Payments can be forwarded from one person to another through multiple channels. That allows anyone to pay anyone else in the network (as long as they can find a route).
Udi Wertheimer has a channel with TorGuard and a channel with Bitrefill. Bitrefill payed TorGuard through Udi. Bitrefill payed Udi through the channel they share and Udi payed TorGuard.
Through the use of smart contracts and clever cryptography this all happens in a secure, trustless way. Each payment in the route relies on the same key. To get payment from Udi, TorGuard's node had to reveal the key to Udi's node. With that key Udi's node could claim payment from Bitrefill. Udi and Bitrefill don't have to trust each other. Udi doesn't even need to know that his node is forwarding a payment.

@_date: 2018-01-18 12:09:15
Short answer: No, the cryptography involved ensures that no intermediate can receive payment without paying forward.
More detailed answer: Each hop in a routed payment relies on the same hash key. To claim payment the node has to know the key and reveal it to the node they are getting money from. That node then knows the key and can use it to claim payment from the next one, and so on, till it gets back to whoever is sending the payment.

Lightning is still useful at small scales. Users can start by connecting directly to merchants or exchanges that support it. That would be equivalent to a refundable gift card. When people start connecting to multiple services they will act as bridges. Merchants and exchanges can start connecting to each other directly. The larger and better connected the network becomes the more useful it will be. But it doesn't have to have a huge number of users to be useful for some people who will bootstrap the network.
Bitcoin itself went through (and is still going through) the same thing.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:37:50
Atomic swaps are a way for two people to exchange cryptocurrencies without trusting each other. Both transactions are tied together cryptographically so the whole thing happens together or not at all. Neither person can take the other person's coins and run away without paying.
To understand how that works with Lightning you need to understand how Lightning routing works.
A normal routed Lightning payment would be something like
Alice pays Bob 1.00001 mBTC, Bob pays Carol 1 mBTC, Bob keeps 1 satoshi as a fee. Each step is tied together using a cryptographic key.
The process looks like this:
1. Carol creates a secret.
2. She scrambles the secret.
3. She gives Alice the scrambled secret.
4. Alice says to Bob "I'll pay you 1.00001 mBTC if you can tell me the solution to this scrambled secret. You can get the solution from Carol for 1 mBTC. I'll pay you 0.00001 mBTC as a fee for your trouble."
5. Alice signs a smart contract to that effect.
6. Bob turns around and says to Carol "I'll pay you 1 mBTC for the solution to this." and signs a similar contract.
7. Carol gives Bob the solution and collects 1 mBTC.
8. Bob now has the solution and gives it to Alice, collecting his 1.00001 mBTC
Bob can't sell the solution to Alice, until he first buys it from Carol. And Bob is assured by the smart contract that if he buys it from Carol he will be able to sell it to Alice. No one has to trust anyone.
All of that negotiating is done in the background by Alice, Bob, and Carol's respective Lightning nodes.
But there's no reason each hop has to be in the same currency. If Alice only has bitcoin and Carol only accepts litecoin, Alice can pay Bob in bitcoin and Bob can pay Carol in Litecoin.
Or it could loop back to Alice if Alice wants to trade Bitcoin for Litecoin. Alice pays Bob 1 mBTC and Bob pays Alice 60 mLTC.
The trading process would look like this:
1. Alice creates a secret and scrambles it.
2. She tells Bob the scrambled secret and creates a smart contract that pays Bob 1 mBTC if he can produce the secret.
3. Bob sees this and creates a similar smart contract that pays Alice 60 mLTC if she produces the secret.
4. Alice uses the secret to claim the litecoin, revealing the secret to Bob in the process.
5. Bob now knows the secret and and uses it to claim the bitcoin from Alice.

Segwit, if fully used, would relieve clogging temporarily, until more adoption brings more transactions and fills the blocks again. A block size increase would do the same thing. Neither on their own are long term solutions.
The much bigger deal is the Lightning Network (which segwit more or less enables). Lightning allows an unlimited number of Bitcoin transactions that are instant, cheap, and secure. It does that by moving transactions off chain, so they are cheap and instant, while falling back to the blockchain as an arbitrator, if necessary, to keep it secure.
In the short term Lightning will reduce on chain mining fees by moving transactions off the block chain. In the long term it will make on chain fees less relevant because most transactions will happen off chain.

On chain segwit transactions aren't segwit's killer feature. That's basically just doing the same thing we've always done but with lower transaction fees. Anyone who isn't highly concerned about fees can ignore segwit.
Lightning is segwit's first killer feature. It blows on chain segwit's fee savings out of the water, especially for micropayments; and ensures transactions stay cheap regardless of scale. Instant, cheap micropayments will open up whole new use cases and markets.
There's also compatibility. In order to pay someone who only accepts Lightning payments you have to be on Lightning yourself. People who don't use segwit can still transact with those who do. When dvds came out they quickly killed vhs. When blu-ray came along it didn't kill dvds because people can still use dvds in their blu-ray players.

Until there are other people you can pay on LN I don't see the point of using LN for TorGuard. Since LN takes two on chain transactions per channel you have to expect to make at least two payments on a channel for it to break even. Three if you want it to be cheaper.
Based on their pricing structure there is only one scenario where is makes sense to pay them twice in a year: If you expect to use it for exactly six months. There are none that make sense to pay them three or more times in a year.
If you expect to use it for one month, that's just one payment. If you expect to use it for two months, then it is cheaper to get the quarterly bundle, again one payment. Between three and six months is the sweet spot for two quarterly payments. Between six months and a year and it becomes cheaper to get the annual bundle.
If you are using it for multiple years then you could commit multiple years worth of money to a channel, but who wants to lock up that much money for that much time?

There are three ways that's not true:
First, any wallet that only sends and doesn't receive Lightning payments, like Eclair's android wallet, is safe without watching the blockchain at all. The fund stealing attack relies on publishing an old transaction that gives the victim less than they would get from the latest state. If a wallet holder only sends, their balance in the channel only goes down over time, and they can never end up with a lower balance from an old channel state.
Second, a Lightning wallet doesn't have to constantly watch. They just have to check once every so often, based on how long the lock time on the channel is. If the lock time is a week, for example, they could connect once every five days and have a two day margin of safety.
Third, watching the blockchain for cheating is something that can be outsourced to a watchdog service.

They actually have to pay forward *before* receiving payment themselves. But by paying forward they get the cryptographic key they need to be guaranteed to be able to claim payment from the next hop.
There is no time limit to claim payment from the next hop, but until they do they don't get paid, so there is every incentive to do it as soon as possible.
Example scenario: Alice wants to pay Carol 10 mBTC. Alice has a channel with Bob. Bob has a channel with Carol.
1. Carol creates a secret.
2. She scrambles the secret.
3. She gives Alice the scrambled secret.
4. Alice says to Bob "I'll pay you 10.001 mBTC if you can tell me the solution to this scrambled secret. You can get the solution from Carol for 10 mBTC. I'll pay you 0.001 mBTC as a fee for your trouble."
5. Alice signs a smart contract to that effect.
6. Bob turns around and says to Carol "I'll pay you 10 mBTC for the solution to this." and signs a similar contract.
7. Carol gives Bob the solution and collects 10 mBTC.
8. Bob now has the solution and gives it to Alice, collecting his 10.001 mBTC
Bob can't sell the solution to Alice, until he first buys it from Carol. And Bob is assured by the smart contract that if he buys it from Carol he will be able to sell it to Alice.

Yes. When Lightning routes a payment it uses a secret key. Each hop in the route requires a node reveal the key to the other node in the respective channel, allowing them to use it to claim the next hop, and so on. That way every payment in the route happens or none do. Any of those hops can be an on chain transaction that depends on the same key.

But it is extremely early days right now. It is too soon to know for sure what the final network topology will look like. The topology of the Internet, for example, has changed a lot since the early days when it was limited to universities and government institutions.
Merchants who accept lightning payment directly make natural hubs. The more small businesses there are using lightning the more decentralized it will be.
The most important thing is that Lightning is resilient to abuse. If a major node starts starts abusing its users they can open other channels to route around the problem.

There are two key things here:
1) A merchant doesn't need a direct channel with every customer because payments are routed over the network through a series of connected channels.
2) It only takes three transactions in a channel before the channel is cheaper than doing those same transactions on chain. Opening and closing a channel is just two on chain transactions over the whole life of the channel. Lightning is even more economical if you open the channel when there is a lull and mining fees are low.

People will close channels whenever one side or the other stops using it. There are many reasons that could happen: They spend all their money, their laptop gets run over, they forget their password, they die, they decide to put their money in BBQCoin, they decide to invest in real estate, etc.

Opening a channel is one on chain transaction. How long it takes depends on the same factors that determine how long it takes for any on chain transaction to confirm: How high of a mining fee you are paying relative to the going rate, and mining variance.
With Lightning, though, you can open the channel at any time before you want to spend. You can wait for an off peak time when there is a dip in mining fees to get in cheap, then make instant and cheap payments anytime after that. Compare that to paying on chain, where you have to pay the high end of whatever the going fee is at the time you make the payment to ensure quick confirmation.

If you are going to route payments you not only have to dedicate your capital to outgoing capacity, you have to get other people to dedicate their money to a channel with you, so you have incoming capacity.
Merchants and exchanges have a huge leg up here. They have a built in reason for people to put money up. Exchanges have the additional trick of opening channels with users then sending withdrawals through those channels to create ready made incoming capacity.
If you run a node from your home without tying it to any other business, how are you going to get other people to connect to you, rather than the merchant or exchange they actually want to send money to?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:12:28


I have to challenge that. Merchants don't have to put anything up when a user opens a channel with them. They have nothing to lose, and potentially a lot to gain in revenue, from a lot of people opening channels with them. And a lot of people want to open channels with them either because they want to buy from them or because they are well connected.
Looking at the [network graph]( there are definite hubs that have way more channels than the rest.
Here's a challenge: Pick two random nodes and find a route between them that doesn't go through one of the ten biggest nodes. Most of the network would be disconnected if a handful of the biggest nodes went down.

You use an output script that makes the on chain transaction dependant on the same key that is used for the LN payment. In order for the other person to claim the coins you send on chain they have to reveal the key, which kicks off the LN payment and ensures you get paid.
Lightning transactions are just Bitcoin transactions that haven't been published to the blockchain. Almost every smart contract trick that can be done in Lightning can be done with an on chain transaction. The only difference (a major one) is that an on chain transaction is immutable and a Lightning transaction can be quickly and easily replaced.

That's the way it worked for the original design. The current design uses revocation and relative lock time. The clock only starts ticking once one side tries to unilaterally close the channel, giving the other side time to contest it. Until that happens the channel can stay open indefinitely.

Onion routing makes that pointless. They can restrict who they connect to directly, but not who can connect indirectly. They have no of knowing if a payment is coming from someone they connected to directly or someone routing through them.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:26:01
For each balance update (or Lightning payment) there are two unpublished Bitcoin transactions, both listing the same amounts, one held by each person. They have time locks such that a person who publishes their transaction can't spend from it for a certain amount of time, giving the other person time to challenge it.
When they update the balance again and create two new transactions, they invalidate the old ones by sending keys to each other that enable the punishment.
So if Malory tries to cheat by closing the channel with an old balance, she can't claim any of those coins for a while giving Bob time to use the key she gave him to claim all of the coins.


The punishment can only be used against someone that tries to cheat. Don't cheat and you will be fine.


This is a different issue but is also solved with clever cryptography. Payment routing uses a secret key. Each hop in the route requires the same key. So when one node goes to claim the payment from the next node they reveal that key. Now the next node has the key and can claim the next payment in the route, and so on back to the source payer. That way no one can take a payment without routing it on.

That's how the Eclair Android wallet works. You scan a QR code for the node you want to open a channel with, enter the amount you want in the channel, hit ok and wait for confirmation. Then once the channel is open, you scan another QR code for the payment request, verify the amount, and hit send. Bata boom bata bam you've made a payment.

There is no way to enforce KYC or AML on Lightning because it has built in, always on proxying. A node that relays a payment only knows the node it received it from and the node it sent it to, not where the payment started or its ultimate destination. In fact Lightning is *more* private than transactions that are published on the blockchain for the whole world to see.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:52:58
Exchanges would be the perfect thing to close the loop on Lightning. 
User pays merchant. Merchant sends to exchange so they can pay their fiat only supplier. User buys more coins on exchange. They withdraw routed through the merchant. User's channel with the merchant and merchant's channel with the exchange both get rebalanced in the process.
Or, user buys coins at exchange and withdraws them in the form of opening a channel. User pays merchant routed through exchange. Merchant sends back to exchange rebalancing channel.

That's the ideal end state, but it's going to take a lot of bootstrapping to get there. For right now the only person you can pay with a channel to TorGuard, to my knowledge, is TorGuard.
As they start getting users with channels those users could start paying each other. But how many users will it take before a significant number of users want to pay each other?
Once other services are connected to the Lightning Network then it will gain more utility. But to attract a significant number of services they either need to know that there are enough users to make it worth it, or be willing to pay the price of being a pioneer.
I think that the most successful applications of the lightning network early on will be applications where it makes sense to use a payment channel with a single service regardless of who else you can connect to.
It takes time to bootstrap a whole new network.

Just sending to and from segwit addresses isn't very interesting. It's a bit cheaper, but there isn't really a new use case there. There's not much incentive to switch.
Lightning opens up a whole new set of use cases. Things that rely on instant payments and microtransactions that aren't practical on chain: paywalls, gambling, gaming microtransactions, the digital equivalent of making it rain, etc.
Things will pop up that require lightning. Some of the most popular early uses will be frivolous or base, but they will get people using it. Once they are on board more serious uses cases will develop.

It adjusts both directions, but it only happens once every 2,016 blocks. Suddenly add a lot of hash power and the next adjustment comes fast. Suddenly remove a lot of hashpower and the adjustment comes slow.
If BCash had stuck with that adjustment algorithm it would have been dead in the water because it would never have gotten enough blocks to get to the next adjustment (which is what happened to segwit2x). That's why BCash added the emergency difficulty adjustment, so they could adjust the diff down faster.

A lot of people were sold on Bitcoin being a cheaper alternative to paypal and western union by things like [this]( For a while it was. But that's not what makes Bitcoin interesting. The most important and revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin is decentralization.
There were a number of digital currency attempts before Bitcoin: DigiCash, E-gold, Liberty Dollar. They all had a fatal flaw: they were centralized. They were each controlled by individual companies that the government could easily shut down. All they had to do was show up and unplug the servers.
Bitcoin solved that problem by being the first digital currency to be decentralized. There is no headquarters to be raided or hacked. No one can run off with the reserves. If someone wanted to shut down Bitcoin they would have to shut down every single user.
Decentralization has other important benefits. No one can print extra bitcoin and inflate the currency to worthlessness, like a lot of national currencies do. No one can censor transactions they don't like, like the banks did and do to Wikileaks and other political undesirables. No one can alter the record to steal funds or pretend like something didn't happen. No one can do a bail in and seize everyone's funds, like the banks in Cyprus and Greece did.
The Bitcoin Core developers decided to prioritize decentralization at the temporary expense of cheap fast payments because they know how crucial decentralization is for Bitcoin's survival and success.
Now that the Lightning Network is here Bitcoin will once again have cheap and fast payments, but they will happen on the foundation of a strong, decentralized and secure base layer.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:47:46
The normal problem with centralization is that it gives the center too much control. A central fiat bank can steal your funds or censor your payments. With Lightning centralized hubs can't take control because users can fall back to the decentralized first layer if necessary.
If a hub tries to steal your funds you can fall back on the blockchain and claim not just the funds they tried to steal but the entire balance of the channel.
A Lightning hub can't effectively censor payments because of built in onion routing. But even if they try you can close the channel and reopen it with someone else to route around them.
Lightning will be as decentralized as it needs to be, but it doesn't always have to be completely decentralized as long as it can always fall back on decentralization.

What do you mean? It's a lot more flexible than on chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:35:40
To a degree. You can break transactions down by value into three groups:
1. Transactions that are too big for Lightning. They will always be on chain and can afford the highest fees. (You can also include opening and closing transactions in with this group since they have to be on chain.)
2. Transactions that are small enough to be practical on Lightning, while being large enough to be worth the on chain fee if there was no Lightning. These are the transactions that will move from on chain to Lightning.
3. Transactions that are too small to be practical on chain. These will only happen on Lightning. They won't have any effect on mining fees because they never would have been on chain anyway. They will be irrelevant to the blockchain but very relevant to Lightning.
The amount that transaction fees fall will depends on the ratio between groups 1 and 2. If group 1 is large enough to keep blocks full then fees won't fall much. The threshold between 1 and 2 depends on how much liquidity people are willing to put into Lightning. It should go up over time as trust in Lightning grows, but should cap out at some point when most people have all of their hot wallet funds in Lightning.

In that scenario they can't make a payment with the money tied up in the channel until the closing transaction confirms and the lock time expires, plus the confirmation time for the actual payment or new channel opening transaction.

More or less true.


Not at all true. A channel is a 2-of-2 multisig address. It has no value without an on chain transaction sending bitcoin to that address. Once opened the total amount in the channel is fixed and doesn't change without an additional on chain transaction. The only thing that changes is how much of the total each party in the channel gets.

Yes, both you and the person you are opening the channel with decide how much you each will put in initially. You both send your initial amounts to a 2 of 2 multiple signature address that requires both of you to sign off to release the funds.
The total amount stays the same for the life of the channel. What changes is how much of the total each of you get. For each payment you create and sign a new transaction that specifies how much each person gets. For each transaction, the previous one it replaces is invalidated.
At any time either person can take the last transaction and drop it onto the blockchain to close out the channel and pay out it's funds.

Opening a channel costs the same tx fee as making the payment on chain. Once you have the channel opened you can make the payment for nothing (if you are paying the person you just open the channel with) or next to nothing (if you are routing it through someone else). You can also make additional payments to them or anyone they are connected to, for next to nothing.
If you expect to make at least three payments to someone or to anyone they are connected to them opening a lightning channel is cheaper. That applies whether the on-chain transaction fees are 100 satoshis or 100 bitcoins.

* Mini hubs. Small hubs crop up to serve [local markets]( Bitcoin meetup groups and other niche groups.
* Direct to merchant. Customers who regularly buy from a given merchant setup channels with that merchant.
* Lunch settlement. Friends could set up a channel to divvy up the daily lunch bill.
* Cryptocurrency exchange. Traders set up channels with an exchange to speculate on relative values of cryptocurrencies.
Any of those could be useful even without being connected to a wider network. Once they start getting connected together they could form the initial backbone of the network.

You have to watch the blockchain to make sure the other person isn't publishing an old record of the channel balance.
Say we have a channel that starts out with me putting in 20 mBTC and you putting in 0. We create and sign a bitcoin transaction that says I have 20 mBTC and you have 0. I buy a widget from you for 5 mBTC. I sign a transaction that says I have 15 mBTC and you have 5 mBTC. You send me the widget.
I still have the old transaction that says I have the full 20. I could publish it and try to steal back the 5 mBTC. If you are paying attention, you can use a punishment mechanism built into the smart contract that allows you to take the full 20 mBTC. But you have to act within a certain amount of time. If you don't then I get away with it. That's why it has to be watched.
You can have someone else monitor the chain for you and publish the punishment on your behalf, so you don't have to always be online yourself.

The power of the Lightning Network is that payments can be trustlessly routed through multiple intermediaries to reach people you don't personally share a channel with, so you don't have to open a channel for every one-off payment.
To illustrate consider this list of people and companies:
* Walbert - Everyone's favorite box store
* Starblocks - Expensive but stylish coffee shop
* Gamehalt - Place to trade in games for more than you would get from throwing them away.
* Yalls - Article hosting site where readers pay a small amount for each article they read.
* Alice - Works at Walbert. She has a channel with Walbert that they use to pay her wages. Loves Starblocks and has a channel with them that she uses to buy coffee.
* Bob - Works at Gamehalt and has a channel for wages. Shops at Walbert a lot and has a channel there.
* Charlene - Gamer girl. Shops at Gamehalt a lot and has a channel there. Goes on Yalls to discuss games and has a channel there where she pays to read other's articles and gets paid a bit for things she writes.
* Daniel - Friend of Bob. Has a channel with Bob that they use to divide up lunch costs.
* Emily - Charlene's roommate. Has a channel she uses to pay Charlene the rent.
* Frank - Also drinks a lot of coffee from Starblocks and has a channel with them.
Bob has an Alf alarm clock that he wants to sell. He lists it on Craigslist. Alice wants it. Alice pays Bob for it with a LN payment routed through Walbert. She pays Walbert using the channel she has with them, they take a tiny fee and pay Bob through the channel he has with them.
The HR manager at Walbert decides to order Starblocks coffee for the break room. Walbert pays Alice, who pays Starblocks.
Daniel wants to buy Charlene's used copy of Assassin's Mantra. The payment goes Daniel -&gt; Bob -&gt; Gamehalt -&gt; Charlene
Frank stumbles across Yalls and decides to try it out by posting a one off rant. It gets some reads and Yalls pays him. Yalls -&gt; Charlene -&gt; Gamehalt -&gt; Bob -&gt; Walbert -&gt; Alice -&gt; Starblocks -&gt; Frank.
The underlying smart contracts are structured in a way such that each payment either gets forwarded through the whole payment route, or doesn't happen at all. No one in the middle can steal the money and refuse to pass it on.
Because of that trustlessness, there is no risk in routing a payment. LN wallets can automatically route payments making it frictionless and easy.
If you want to try it out there is a testnet version running.  is the easiest to use for simple sending and receiving. It's a hosted wallet. It keeps the channels hidden on the back end. It gives you some testnet coins to play with. Eclair for android is the easiest wallet that lets you set up and manage your own channels. You will need to get some testnet coins from a [faucet]( to use it.
There are a couple places to use it.  let's you read what others have submitted for a small fee.  let's you order a virtual "coffee".

Short term: Miners still make most of their money from new coins. LN can bring the fees down and miners will still be okay.
Medium term: Lower on-chain fees, combined with how useful and inexpensive LN will be will attract interest, increase Bitcoin's use, and drive up price. Higher price means the coins miners get are worth more.
Long term: Lightning channels still require on-chain transactions to open and close. Get enough users opening and closing channels and it will keep the blockchain busy. If you have a long term channel that does hundreds of transactions then you can pay a higher fee to open and close it than you would for a single on-chain payment and it's still worth it. Paying a $20 transaction fee to buy a cup of coffee is ridiculous. Paying $40 to open and close a channel that you keep open for a couple years and use to buy 600 cups of coffee isn't that bad.

The grace period is a configurable trade off. If you set it longer then you have more time to act if the other person tries to cheat you, but you have to wait longer to close the channel if the other person goes AWOL.

People use checking accounts with debit cards as a primary form of transacting. That's "tying up" funds with a single bank.
LN channels are like checking accounts in that they allow you to route payments to anyone in the network. But unlike bank accounts you retain control over your own money and you can open a channel with anyone.
Try out Eclair wallet on testnet. It's remarkably easy for how new the tech is. Opening a channel is about as easy as making an onchain payment. And once you have a channel open making payments is easier because you don't have to wait for confirmations.

RBF is "Replace By Fee". With RBF an unconfirmed transaction can be double spent by a transaction with a higher fee. There are a few variations.
First Seen Safe (FSS-RBF) only allows the replacement if the new transaction includes all of the inputs and outputs that the old transaction did. It guarantees that whoever was being paid by the first tx is still paid, so it can't be used to cheat anyone. The downside is that each time the fee is bumped a new input has to be included. If you run out of inputs you can't bump the fee anymore.
Opt-In RBF allows a transaction to set a flag marking it as replaceable. A replacement transaction is accepted if the old transaction has the flag and the new transaction has a higher fee.
Full RBF allows any transaction to be replaced by any transaction with a higher fee. Full RBF would make zero confirmation transactions (which many merchants rely on) completely insecure.

Opening a channel is exactly like making an onchain payment: Scan a QR code with the node id, set an amount for the initial balance, publish and wait for for a couple confirmations.

There's a little bit more routing complexity, but the payments themselves aren't any more complex than Lightning Network payments that share a chain.


Sidechains are great for allowing users to opt-in to different features by choosing different chains, but they fracture the network. If I am on chain A and you are on chain B, I can't pay you with traditional bitcoin transactions.
Using the Lightning Network to pay across chains solves that.


The Lightning Network only requires on chain transactions when setting up a payment channel and when closing it. While the channel is open it can be used to make as many payments as you want without touching the blockchain or paying fees for each one.

The most common argument I've heard is in relation to the great blocksize war: Small blockists saying establish a fee market and keep resource usage low to keep bitcoin secure and decentralized and that it doesn't matter if you can use it to pay for coffee, as long as it makes a good store of value (see OP tweet). Large blockists saying keep the fees low to keep bitcoin accessible to daily spending.
What's going to change in the future is scale. Both store of value and medium of exchange benefit from the system scaling up (store of value because the same size pie divided among more people is more value per piece, and medium of exchange because the more people you can exchange it with the more useful it is). How to scale and how to navigate the inherent tradeoffs is the six and a half billion dollar question.

Lightning Network payments can be routed through multiple channels to reach people you aren't connected to directly. If Alice has a channel with Bob and Bob has a Channel with Charlie, then Alice can pay Charlie through Bob. Alice pays Bob using their shared channel and Bob pays Charlie with that channel. That can be extended to as many hops as necessary to get to the destination.
The cryptography built into the channel smart contract assures that each payment in the route happens together, or they don't happen at all. No one in the middle can steal the money, so no one has to be trusted.

The reasons Bitcoin transactions are public is so that you know that the coins you receive are legitimate and haven't been sent to someone else. In Lightning both of those things are taken care of by the on chain transactions that open and close channels.
When you open a channel you lock coins in that channel. When you close the channel you are claiming the coins you locked up, so the public knows those coins are legitimate.
Both parties who share a channel have to sign off on everything that happens to the coins locked in the channel. They don't have to worry about the other person sending some of the coins to someone else without their knowledge.
What's still public: how much total money is in each channel.
What's private: what happens to that money while it is in the channel.

I support BIP 100. It allows dynamic blocksize changes, which means we don't have to go through this whole mess every time the size needs changed. It is simpler than the elastic blocksize proposal.
My second choice would be a 8 MB blocksize. That seems a good compromise between the various camps. The Chinese mining pools [support it](
Long term solutions that would be good but aren't fully developed yet:
* Market based network resource allocation, as advocated by [Justus Ranvier]( Work being done on micropayment channel based paid bitorrents by [Joystream]( could lay the groundwork.
* Sidechains to allow experimentation with different blocksizes and off loading some transactions from the main chain.
* The Lightning Network to move smaller payments off chain in a trustless way.

There are a few things miners do:
1. Collect and verify potential new transactions.
2. Assemble the transactions into a candidate block.
3. Do the proof of work by running hashes on the block hoping to find a hash below a certain value.
4. When step 3 is satisfied, get the block out to the network before a competing block is found.
How bigger blocks affect each step:
1. This step only depends on the number of transactions that Bitcoin users are creating. Big blocks might indirectly affect this by attracting more Bitcoin use.
2. This step is trivial regardless of the size of the block.
3. This step is where the heavy lifting happens. Block size has absolutely no effect on this step.
4. Bigger blocks take longer to get out to the whole network, which means more chance of a competing block being found and getting out first. This step is miners' biggest incentive to keep blocks small.

More or less. The difference is that with payment channels you don't have to trust the other party. A bank can freeze or seize the money in your account for any number of reasons. If you have a payment channel with Coinbase, for example, Coinbase can't steal your share of the channel. The worst they could do is temporarily freeze it until the channel times out. Payment channels are also full reserve, unlike banks.

A lot of people already use Coinbase, Bitpay, Changetip, etc. as bitcoin middlemen. Using middlemen to take transactions off the blockchain can be cheaper, more efficient, and more convenient. It even has the potential to be more private, since you aren't putting your transactions in a public and permanent record that everyone can view and analyse for the rest of time.
The risk in using a middleman is that it adds an extra person you have to trust. But Lightning Network payment channels are trustless. LN hubs can't steal your money. The worst they can do is keep it tied up for a little bit until the channel times out. Then you switch to another hub (of which there can be thousands) and go on your way.

CTs can be used with CoinJoin to hide both the values and the graph. Using CTs with CoinJoin actually hides the graph better than using CoinJoin on its own, because it protects against amount correlation attacks.
I have 7.09316758 btc that I want to mix. I could split it up and send it through CoinJoin. If I'm not careful and combine the mixed outputs, perhaps while spending them, someone could match the 7.09316758 btc that came out with the 7.09316758 btc that I put in.

Dictatorship with open borders. Strong focused leadership for each version and users are free to decide which version they want to support, or go start their own.
That way we get the best of both worlds. Strong leadership on a given version means things get done and decisions get made. The ability to switch versions means the community isn't locked into any one person's control.

If a fork is scheduled at a fixed block number then miners and nodes know when they have to upgrade. But if the change happens regardless of how much hashing power has adopted it then it could result in a nasty fork, where both sides have about the same amount of hashing power and they have to battle it out.
If the change only goes into effect when a certain percent of the last so many blocks have that version, then you know that the amount of hashing power on the old version is less than a given amount. One of the numbers that has been thrown out there is 800 out of the last 1000 blocks needed to change. But if 20% of the hashing power left behind is too much it could be something else, 900/1000, 950/1000, 999/1000, it could even be 1000/1000, but that could a long time to achieve.
Full nodes can see which blocks are on which version and how fast blocks with the new version are taking over. If full nodes need more warning then a change could happen a set number of blocks after the threshold is reached.

Miners (by which I mean solo miners and pool operators, who actually create blocks) validate transactions before putting them in a block. This has two purposes: First, it protects SPV wallets. Because miners validate transactions, SPV wallets can count on proof that a transaction is in the blockchain as proof that it is valid. Second, miners validate transactions so that they don't mine invalid blocks that will be rejected by other miners.
Miners also fully validate blocks from other miners before mining on them themselves. Again this is so that they don't waste mining power on blocks that will be rejected by other miners.
In order to validate everything they have to have everything. They also have to keep everything they may need to rely on to validate new transactions in the future, namely the full set of unspent transaction outputs.

A split would be a very bad thing. It would cause a lot of uncertainty about which side will win out. It also causes compatibility issues. If a customer is running on one fork and a merchant is running on another then the customer can't pay the merchant. A divided network isn't as strong as a unified one.
The way a split is avoided is each miner includes the number of the version they are running in each block header. A change doesn't go into effect until a minimum number of the last X blocks, 800 out of the last 1000, for example, have the version for that change. That way a change doesn't happen until everyone is on board.
But getting everyone on board can take time.

A good way to measure distribution of node implementations, for example, is the odds that any two randomly selected nodes run the same implementation. To calculate it take the percent of the total for each implementation, square it, and sum them. The lower the better.
The same method can be used with mining power, exchange volume, dev commits, etc.
[Node agents]( with version number removed: 96.63%
[Node countries]( 16.31%
[Exchange volume]( same exchange but different countries counted seperately: 18.14%
Exchange volume, same exchange different countries count the same: 19.31%
Commits to Bitcoin Core master branch by developer: 14.22%

Coins are locked up on the main chain before being created on a sidechain. Whatever that sidechain does it can only unlock those coins. It can't create new coins on the main chain.
I suppose it's theoretically possible for a sidechain to run on a fractional reserve, but sidechains will be opensource and decentralized just like Bitcoin, so their monetary policy will be just as transparent.

It's true that a single payment channel is between two people. But the real power of the Lightning Network is that it allows payments to be chained through multiple channels.
Let's say I have a channel with Coinbase, you have a channel with Bitpay, and Coinbase and Bitpay have a channel with each other. I want to make a one off purchase from your webstore. We set up a chain of transactions such that I pay Coinbase, Coinbase pays Bitpay, and Bitpay pays you. I sent you a single payment using channels without needing a direct channel with you.
I can then use my Coinbase channel to route payments to several other webstores. Come payday my employer can route my pay to me through that same Coinbase channel. Coinbase and Bitpay can use their single mega-channel to route money from thousands of Coinbase customers to thousands of Bitpay customers. You can use your Bitpay channel to receive money from several other customers.
Taking it back to the checking account analogy, if I wrote you a check it would work the same way. My bank would subtract it from my account, send it to your bank via a clearing house, and your bank would add it to your account.

The second most likely death I see is that the costs of securing a cryptocurrency with proof of work will catch up to it. As mining subsidy is reduced the costs will shift to the users in the form of transaction fees, which will push users off to other systems.

If the blocksize limit is raised too high then full nodes and miners have a high resource burden. That could cause small nodes and miners to drop out of the network, which would concentrate power in the hands of the bigger players that stay. Meanwhile a race to the bottom on transaction fees would allow a high number of low-priority "spam" transactions to get on the blockchain.
If the blocksize limit is too low, then we run into capacity problems. Competition would raise transaction fees until all but the highest priority transactions are priced out. That would limit what on chain transactions can be used for.
I don't know where the right line is between too high and too low. No one does. That's why we need a [market for network resources]( instead of a static blocksize limit.

I think [case]( looks promising. One key is held on the device. One is held by Case Wallet Inc. The third key is, by default, held by another independent third party, Third Key Solutions. (Power users can also choose to use their own third key.)
The user doesn't have to backup or even see any private keys. Neither Case Wallet Inc nor Third Key Solutions can steal the coins unless they collude with each other. Funds won't be lost if one of the companies disappear, unless they both do at the same time.




Case uses a fingerprint scan to authenticate to the server, but that can be easily defeated.
If they used a pin and limited the number of tries, I would think it would be more secure.

All analogies are wrong, but they can be useful in moderation.
The blocksize limit will have to be raised at some point. The doctor knows that the if tumor is left in the patient it will eventually kill him. It has to be removed at some point. The question is when and how.
If we wait until there is a crisis then Bitcoin could take a major hit in usability and reputation. If the doctor waits until the patient is in crisis the patient could suffer major harm.
If there is a way to gather more information we should be doing that. A doctor may decide not to operate until he can gather more information about the tumor, but that doesn't mean he just sits around waiting. He runs tests and scans and whatever else he can to learn more about it.
Whether we raise the blocksize now or wait we need a clear plan for what we will do and under what circumstances. A good doctor has a plan and a clear set of criteria to determine if and when to operate.
Taking no action and making no plan until we run headlong into an emergency is reckless and irresponsible.

The raw transaction you posted is trying to pay to 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9.

1. [Here]( 1MvhZGPopDeUdrx8EBc6qFdmLENZaQNdKt and two other addresses pay 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9 and 123dm41A9W9qktAWaJNdqjUZeUFWnH25Yi
2. [Here]( 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9 pays 1G5bCHNMoczeHkvGxBvExRsDi5LeVabZEM
3. [Here]( 1G5bCHNMoczeHkvGxBvExRsDi5LeVabZEM pays 38qQUmo6jU6UFKC4J38AfaZpvc17UM1Pxv
4. [Here]( 38qQUmo6jU6UFKC4J38AfaZpvc17UM1Pxv pays back to 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9 
Here's my guess of what happened:
1. You paid someone with the 123dm41A9W9qktAWaJNdqjUZeUFWnH25Yi address 0.45 BTC. (Correct me if I'm wrong). Your wallet automatically created 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9 as a change address.
2. You paid the deposit on the Streamium page. Your wallet paid out of the change address from 1.
3. The Streamium page paid the multisig address.
4. At the end of the stream Streamium sent the change back to the address the deposit came from, namely 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9, instead of the change address you specified.
Because 1C4ARVko3oczYA7G3Rkhn39NwFYwFnYHT9 is a change address your wallet may not have been expecting to receive external coins on it.
What wallet are you using?
Is there a way to see the change addresses in your wallet?

Predictable is nice, but some things need to be able to adjust to the market. For example, a predictable mining difficulty or a predictable schedule for the number of loaves of bread that will be produced each year would cause more harm than good. When supply and demand factors change things need to be able to adjust.
That's why I think that a dynamic blocksize, like BIP-100 or flex caps, would be the best solution long term. It would also take the devs out of the central planner role and end this civil war once and for all.
Dynamic blocksizes are complicated and will take time to work out, though. So in the meantime reasonable bumps are needed to tide us over.

It's true that a single payment channel is between two people. But the real power of the Lightning Network is that it allows payments to be chained through multiple channels.
Let's say I have a channel with Coinbase, you have a channel with Bitpay, and Coinbase and Bitpay have a channel with each other. I want to make a one off purchase from your webstore. We set up a chain of transactions such that I pay Coinbase, Coinbase pays Bitpay, and Bitpay pays you. I sent you a single payment using channels without needing a direct channel with you.
I can then use my Coinbase channel to route payments to several other webstores. Come payday my employer can route my pay to me through that same Coinbase channel. Coinbase and Bitpay can use their single mega-channel to route money from thousands of Coinbase customers to thousands of Bitpay customers. You can use your Bitpay channel to receive money from several other customers.
Taking it back to the checking account analogy, if I wrote you a check it would work the same way. My bank would subtract it from my account, send it to your bank via a clearing house, and your bank would add it to your account.
Even though your bank account is a relationship between two parties, you and your bank, you can use it to pay anyone, even if they don't have an account at the same bank.

If you want to use your money to but coffee, lightning has the same risks as any other hot wallet, plus the risk of losing your money if your node crashes since you can't backup channel states. Once [eltoo]( and watchtowers are implemented that extra risk will be gone and it will be as safe as any other hot wallet.
It doesn't have any of the custodial risk of keeping your money on an exchange. You stay in complete control of your own money. The worst a lightning counterparty can do is freeze your money for a couple days while you uncooperatively close the channel.
If you want to hold your coins long term without using them then Lightning isn't appropriate. Put your money in cold storage. If you do that then on chain fees aren't an issue since you aren't transacting (other than once to put it in cold storage and once to eventually pull it out).

In the context of cryptography the public key and the address are not the same. The address is a hash of the public key, which adds an extra level of security. If the first layer of security, elliptic curve cryptography, ever gets broken then someone who has the public key would be able to crack the private key. But if all they have is the address then they still have to get through the second layer of security, the hashing function, to get the public key.

There will never be a 100% secure anything. Security isn't about complete invulnerability. It's about being strong enough for the threats you are likely to face. The idea is to make an attack more expensive for the attacker than the value they get out of it. If the attack isn't worth it to the attacker, they won't do it.
With the marketplace sites like Silk Road law enforcement can take down thousands of sellers by compromising one site. With OpenBazaar they have to go after each seller individually. Every time they take down one seller, everyone else learns from the vulnerability and becomes stronger. Law enforcement has to use a lot more resources to take down the same number of listings.

That gets into how data is represented in computers. Each byte can be thought of as a number between 0 and 255. Those values can represent different things. One way of deciding what those numbers represent is the ascii encoding. In ascii 65 is "A", 66 is "B" and so on to 90 is "Z". The upper case letters are distinguished from the lower case letters. 97 is "a", 98 is "b", 122 is "z".
The digits "0" through "9" are in the ascii encoding, too. The byte 48 represents the character "0", 49 is the character "1", 57 is "9". (A character is a single symbol.)
The other values represent punctuation and computer control codes.
A table of all the ascii codes can be [found here](
Unicode is another, more modern, and more complex, encoding that has become the standard encoding for text. It has a code for every symbol from every language, and then some. It uses multiple bytes for some characters. This smiley face "☺", for example, is the three bytes 226, 152, and 186.

It takes between 4 and 24 minutes for a signal to go one way, depending on how far apart Earth and Mars are at the time. With a 10 minute blocktime that's a huge disadvantage. With a blocktime on the order of hours it might be viable.
For Martians who just want to transact, they have to wait 4-24 minutes for their transaction to get to Earth, however long it takes to confirm, and another 4-24 minutes to get confirmation back. Whether they use Bitcoin or Litecoin they will have to wait 8-48 minutes longer for confirmation than someone using the same coin on Earth.

Just like with Satoshi and Bitcoin, the trustwothiness of the creator doesn't matter as long as the protocol is solid and the source code is open source and independently verified to carry out the protocol the way it should.
I still have a lot more studying to do before I'm comfortable putting money in Bitshares, but I haven't yet found anything that I'm convinced is a major problem with the protocol.


Bitshares is different than 99% of the other altcoins because it actually adds new features, rather than just being a clone or slight variation.


The value I see in BitUSD is that it gives all of the advantages of programmable money, including being borderless and censorship resistant, and potentially including the unprecedented security of multisig, without the massive volatility that Bitcoin has.


"Never invest in a business you cannot understand." - attributed to Warren Buffett
Like I said above, I still need to do a lot more research before I feel like I understand it well enough to put money into it.


Bitshares doesn't work for anyone who needs to trade real fiat. Real fiat is hard to move and hard to trade in a trustless way. Building a decentralized exchange that deals in real fiat is a hard problem.
Speculators and day traders don't need to trade in real fiat. They just need exposure to the price movements. They can do the actual trading with anything as long as that thing is pegged to the value they want to speculate on.

According to Bitcoinity.org 19.63k BTC could be sold on Bitstamp for a total of 6.52 million USD before the price goes below $50/BTC. 25.29k BTC could be sold on Bitfinex for a total of 9.72 million USD. As far as I can see the other exchanges have far less fiat backing market depth.
Those two together mean that there is at least 16.24 million USD worth of value that can be immediately pulled out of Bitcoin. A far cry from the claimed $6 billion market cap. That would go to the first 45k bitcoins sold, 0.33% of the 13.2 million bitcoins that exist.
The smarter move if you wanted to sell off a large amount like that would be to either sell them off slowly to give the market time to absorb them, or sell the whole lot to a single buyer outside of the exchanges, like the marshals did with the silk road bitcoins. Doing either of those would keep the price from completely tanking and you could get a reasonable price for all of the bitcoins, even if it isn't quite as high as the spot price.

If sha256 was reversible you could create new public keys that map to the same address. That wouldn't do you any good without the corresponding private keys, which would require also breaking ECDSA.

Yes and maybe. Yes, checklocktimeverify transactions are committed to the blockchain. This means that it's possible to prove that the coins are locked. It also means that you don't have to hold onto a time locked transaction waiting for it lock before you can send it to the network.
Checklocktimeverify release dates may be visible, depending on whether or not p2sh is used. P2sh obscures the transaction so no one will be able to tell that it is a checklocktimeverify transaction, let alone what the release date is, until it gets released and spent.


One of the things this illustrates is the power of opensource programmable money for innovation and creating new ways to interact with money.

Multisig is the key to protecting yourself from the failure of any one device.
[GreenAddress]( [BitGo]( and [Copay]( are all fairly easy to use multisig wallets. GreenAddress and BitGo both hold and protect one key for you. Copay lets you divide the keys among multiple devices you own and/or among trusted friends.
[Armory]( lets you use multisig with offline wallets, which is the penacle of Bitcoin security. If you are storing $20,000 that's probably what you want. It's not as user friendly as the other wallets I mentioned, though, and it uses a fair amount of computer resources.

I coudn't agree more. Keeping *major* funds in the Coinbase *hosted wallet* is a terrible idea.


That's not the best idea, either. If you have a virus when you create the wallet or plug in the usb stick it will steal your funds.
Deleting the wallet won't protect you. When you delete a file it isn't actually removed from your harddrive, only the listing for the file is removed. If you want a file to be completely gone you have to use a secure wipe process like ccleaner that writes over the file with random garbage a number of times.
Even with that, if the operating system uses caching, as windows does, parts of the file can be left in other place on your computer.
Even if the file is never stored on your computer if it is accessed on your computer it can be captured by malware that reads your RAM.
**Security Rule: Any key that touches a computer that *ever* connects with the internet is vulnerable to compromise.**
If you are using a single-key wallet, that key must be kept offline.
If you can't safely store your coins on your own computer and you can't safely store them with a third party what can you do? The answer is both.
Use a multisig wallet like [GreenAddress]( *or Coinbase's multisig vault*. They hold a key and you hold a key. Both are needed to spend the coins. That means that you are safe if your computer gets hacked, because the hacker doesn't have GreenAddress's *or Coinbase's* key, and you are also safe against GreenAddress *or Coinbase* seizing your coins or getting hacked, because they don't have your key. In order for someone to steal your coins you have to compromise both your computer and GreenAddress *or Coinbase* at the same time.

There may be some approaches, like cold wallets, that if done right (a big if) provide more security (though even a cold wallet would be more secure with multisig).

A logarithmic scale is useful for stocks because it shows the growth in terms of percentage.
A change from $10 to $15 and a change from $100 to $150 are both a growth of 50%. If you buy $1000 dollars worth at $10/share and sell at $15/share you make exactly the same amount as if you buy $1000 worth at $100/share and sell at $150/share.
A logarithmic scale puts the same distance between $10 and $15 as it does between $100 and $150.
A linear scale puts the same distance between $10 and $15 (50%) as it does between $100 and $105 (5%) which aren't equivalent gains.

Use a multisig wallet like [GreenAddress]( preferably also using a hardware wallet like the [HW-1]( You have a key and they have a key. Both are needed to spend the coins. That way they can help protect your coins without being able to seize, freeze, or run off with them.
It is safer than giving over complete control to a third party like you do with coinbase. It's also safer than trying to store them with a single key on your own computer, which could be hacked. It's easier than storing them in a paper or offline wallet where you have to jump through a lot of hoops to do it right, and may have to sweep the entire wallet every time you want to spend.
I see many people suggesting leaving them with Coinbase. ~~That is a terrible idea.~~ As long as they are in the Coinbase hosted wallet you don't own them. You own an IOU. Coinbase has been known to decide regular customers are "high risk" arbitrarily and without warning. They have stopped them from being able to buy bitcoins without recourse.
The IRS has been [seizing bank accounts]( of people who have broke no laws and refusing to give back all of the money. If the IRS or some other government agency asked government-cozy Coinbase to turn over customer funds, they would very likely do it.

While writing out the long reply below I thought of a simple solution: Allow a new delegate to produce a block that contains the transactions that give them the votes needed to become a delegate.
That way the current delegates can never completely lock out their own removal.
Here's the original reply I wrote for completeness:


Because of the nothing at stake problem colluding delegates could replace  a chain of the last x blocks at no cost, as long as all of those blocks were produced by the attacking delegates.
More likely is that the delegates would keep themselves in position to eliminate competition and cut costs by throwing customer service out the window. As long as their cryptocurrency has serious external competition from other currencies, it would produce incentive to behave well, though.


It wouldn't be that hard for 100 people who know each other to band together to protect their own best interest. Unions can be hundreds of thousands of individuals colluding to increase their power over their employers.
In Bitcoin bad eggs can only cease control of the network as long as they are paying to do so. They have incentive to stop misbehaving. As soon as they do Bitcoin recovers and goes back to normal, perhaps with a little weakened confidence.
With DPoS bad eggs only have to get in at some point, any point, in time and they can lock themselves in. The only way to get them out is with a hard fork, which would be a massive hassle.
A hard fork would require hard coding the ban on the offending delegates, deciding who replaces them and getting the update out to users.
Requiring a hard fork every time a group of people tries to use a known avenue of attack without closing the hole is terrible.

The point at which a transaction is reasonably secure is when there is more total mining reward in the blocks confirming it than the amount being sent. That's the point at which it would be more expensive to 51% attack than could be recovered by the double spend.
Eyeballing [this chart] gives me an average number of transactions per block of around 400. 400*6 gives 2400 transactions in six confirmations. All those fees help secure each other. 1/2400 = 0.042% average transaction fee to make the transactions reasonably secure in six confirmations.

What about Coinbase's instant buy?
1. Sign up for Coinbase and get fully verified.
2. Go to a merchant that uses Coinbase or Bitpay.
3. Checkout and get to payment step to get BTC price locked in (for the next 15 mins, or whatever Bitpay and Coinbase give).
4. Go to Coinbase and do an instant buy.
5. Withdraw directly to the payment address generated in step 3
* Is instant buy fast enough to get in the payment window? (I don't know. I've never used it.)
* Getting fully verified at Coinbase means connecting a bank account and a credit card. If you don't have one or the other or don't want to give them to Coinbase you can't do instant buys.
* The whole process takes a number of steps and involves switching back and forth between sites. It could be streamlined a lot. (A kryptokit like extension would be awesome here.)

I like the idea behind tip4commit: support open source with donations. But, there are a tremendous number of great ideas that are terribly implemented in the Cryptocurrency space, and tip4commit is one of them.
Until this post I didn't know that project maintainers are not at all involved with their projects' listing and donations on tip4commit.
How it should work is that a project can only be added by the maintainer, and the maintainer has some control over the project's tip4commit.
Allowing project maintainers to opt-out is the very least of what tip4commit should be doing.


That's a terrible way to do it. People accidentally add projects without knowing they are doing it, including project maintainers trying to see if their project has been added against their wishes.

To elaborate on this: 
One seed for all addresses is the deterministic part of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. Armory also uses deterministic wallets, but it uses it's own seed scheme.
The hierarchical part is that a whole tree of subwallets can be generated. A subwallet could be given to someone else, for example an employee of a company. The holder of the master wallet has full ability to monitor and spend from the subwallet. The holder of the subwallet has no access to the master wallet.

That's not steganography. Steganography is hiding a message so that even someone who knows what they are looking for can't tell that there is anything there to decrypt.
That's closer to security through obscurity: It's assuming that your attacker doesn't know about visual cryptography, won't do a simple [google search]( didn't see this post, and won't post to It's true that if they only have one slide they won't know that the plain image is a qr code. But they could easily know that there is *something* there, which they wouldn't with steganography.
That's not to say that this isn't secure, as long as the two parts are kept seperate, but it isn't steganography.

I don't really see the point.
If it's about being censorship resistant, TOR hidden services do just fine without human meaningful domains. If you have a site that's subject to censorship you're probably going to want a hidden service anyway.
If it's just about price, then it will never be able to break through the network effect of the current DNS system. You can either pay $10/yr to be accessible to every Internet user, or you can take the cheap option and be accessible to a tiny handful of users. As for the users, why should the average joe care about p2p domains when the vast majority of sites can be accessed through traditional DNS, without needing to install any extra plugins or programs?

There are three keys. Any two out of the three are needed to spend the coins. There is one key that Coinbase has access to and two that you have access to.
For most transactions you will use one of your keys and Coinbase will use their key, after you go through their security process with 2 factor authentication and a 48 hr warning period.
If Coinbase goes down or you want to spend without going through their security process then you use both of your two keys to move the coins.

Use nLockTime.
1. Create wallet A. Don't save, write down or memorize the seed.
2. Send the coins to one of its addresses.
3. Create wallet B. Memorize the fuck out of this seed.
4. Create a transaction sending all of the coins from wallet A to wallet B with a nLockTime 20 years from now. Back it up, print it out, bury it in the back yard, do whatever the hell you need to do to make sure that transaction will be there when you get out.
5. Destroy wallet A.
No one, even you, will be able to get those coins before the time is up. If someone forces the seed for wallet B out of you they can't get the coins until the end of the 20 years, and then only if they get their hands on the transaction created in step 4.

I wouldn't recommend BIP-38 passwords with M-of-N. The problem with passwords is that they are easy to lose or forget.
The reason for using BIP-38 with a single key paper wallet is that if someone gets a single key paper wallet that isn't BIP-38 encrypted they have everything they need to take the bitcoins. So you add a password to add an extra factor. BIP-38 wallets are in a sense 1-of-2 wallets.
With M-of-N an attacker who gets one piece doesn't have enough to get the bitcoins. Because that one piece on its own is worthless, there is no need to add a password.
If you are afraid of someone getting two pieces and 2-of-3 isn't secure enough for you, then use 3-of-4 or more. You can step up the security of M-of-N by increasing the number of required fragments.

That being said, at the moment 100,000 Satoshis is in the Goldilocks value zone and makes sense as a unit to use in day to day spending, whether you call it 17 mBTC, 17 kXBT, or 17 &lt;some other unit name&gt;.

What I gather from hearing Andreas Antonopoulos and others talking about it (I was too young at the time to understand what was happening): In the early days of the Internet it was hard to use and not very pretty. It was the domain of geeks who weren't afraid of technical stuff. AOL came along and changed that by making it user friendly. That was a tipping point for mass adoption.
Like the early Internet, early Bitcoin is hard to use and more technical than the average person is comfortable with. What it needs is an "AOL moment" when someone comes up with a way to use it that is simple, clean and easy enough for anyone to use.
There have been a few steps taken in that direction already: rushwallet, changetip, onename, just to name a few. This could be the big one.

The total amount held by everyone is the payout that the changetip people would get for running off with the funds. So far they have a good reputation that is hopefully worth protecting, but they wouldn't be the first web wallet with a good reputation to run off.


I agree that proof-of-reserve from Coinbase (Does BitPay hold users bitcoins? I didn't think they did.) is a higher priority than ChangeTip, but there's no reason why we can't pressure both.

If I send you non-coinbase coins and the block that the transaction is in gets orphaned the transaction can still be included in the other fork.
On the other hand, let's say I mine a block and send you the newly mined coins. If the block I mined gets orphaned then the transaction I created to send them to you can't be included in the other fork, because the coinbase I'm spending doesn't exist on that fork. You would lose the coins you thought you had received.

Let me see if I have this straight:
1. Alice finds a block (block A) and transmits the header.
2. Bob picks up the header and verifies that the hash meets the target.
3. Bob starts mining a new block (block B) on top of Alice's block header, while downloading the rest of the block.
Do I have that right so far?
If so, at this point one of two things could happen first: Bob could finish downloading and verifying block A's contents (transaction integrity, etc.), or find the next block.
If Bob finishes verifying before finishing hashing and all of block B's contents are valid, all is right with the world. If block A is invalid, there still isn't too much harm done at this point because Bob could just go back to mining off of the block Above a.
The biggest problem I see is if block A has invalid contents and Bob finds block B before figuring it out. Then Bob has a dilemma: try to pass off block B in hopes of getting the block reward, or throw away that proof of work and go back to the block before A, or perhaps another fork.
Alice has high incentive to produce a fully valid block A, because there is a significant chance the other miners will catch any shenanigans before finding the next block.

First of all, the video doesn't say anything about Bitcoin. Nor is it in any way clear how Bitcoin would affect any of the things talked about in the video. Powerful people are going to fight over power whether Bitcoin exists or not. That's the nature of power and the people who seek it.
Secondly, what this video is peddling is the emotion of fear. The eerie music, the storm clouds in the background, the dark visual tone, and the tone of voice. I don't trust my emotions. It is very easy to manipulate emotions. If the information presented has any validity then it can stand on its own without the gloomy effects.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:59:58
What I see happening should this be adopted:
1. Pools will have to restrict membership to keep their hashing power at a level they can keep up with.
2. Pool fees will go up from supply and demand.
3. Pool mining will be reduced to those who have high enough margins to afford the higher fees, and who find the lower variance worth it.
4. Those who are willing to take on the variance will solo mine.
5. Those who can't accept either the higher pool fees or the variance will stop mining.
6. The pools will bring in more revenue for the same mining power. They will be spending a significant amount of that on stage-2 mining equipment. The larger pools will build up more and more such equipment, increasing their market share.

Semantics. Bitpay accepts bitcoin on Overstock's behalf. Overstock includes a pay with bitcoin option on their site. Even if they don't take 90% of their bitcoin revenue as bitcoin, they are still in a very meaningful way accepting bitcoin.
Sure, it would be better if they could take all of their bitcoin revenue as bitcoin. I'm sure Patrick Byrne would like nothing better. But until they can pay their suppliers and employees in bitcoin (which they are working on) that's just not practical.
Even when cashing out, merchants like Overstock are helping Bitcoin by making it easier to spend. The easier it is to spend the more attractive it is to obtain. It answers the question "What can I do with it?" Not to mention all the publicity that Bitcoin gets from big merchants.
We should be encouraging businesses to "accept bitcoin", as in allow customers to pay with it, even if they don't "accept bitcoin", as in take possession of the bitcoin themselves.

That's a tough one. Transaction fees will be more significant in 20 years, after 5 halvings, than they are now.
If the value of bitcoin goes up significantly, then a reasonable transaction fee today, say 0.1 mBTC, could be a lot of money by then. But if that is the case then the value of the rest of the bitcoin being saved in the transaction will also go up significantly, more than making up for the high fee.
If the fee is too low, then the transaction may be slow to comfirm, but what is a little extra time compared to 20 years?

It has proven itself as a medium of exchange. It is starting to prove itself as programmable money for the digital age. It has not proven itself as a store of value.
Anything that can unexpectedly and rapidly lose 50-75% of its value is not a smart place to put a significant portion of your money.
Right now bitcoin has 10% annual supply inflation. USD has [1.7% inflation]( According to [this]( there are 165,000 metric tons of gold in the world with 2,500 metric tons mined per year. That is a supply inflation of 1.5%. It will take six years for bitcoin to get down to an inflation rate that is competitive with USD and gold.
Bitcoin is a technology. Technologies have a way of getting disrupted. A new cryptocurrency could come along with a killer feature and highly skilled and motivated people and replace Bitcoin. But won't Bitcoin be able to co-opt any innovations that altcoins come up with? Not all of them. 
There are already things that altcoins have come up with or are working on that Bitcoin cannot easily adopt and still be Bitcoin: DPoS (Bitshares), price pegging (NuBits, BitUSD, etc.), Turing complete contracts (ethereum), and namespacing (Namecoin). Those are just the things that are around now. No one know what people will come up with 5, 10, 20 years in the future.
Bitcoin has not yet co-opted a single major innovation from an altcoin that I am aware of.

The security of Bitcoin is roughly proportional to the miner reward per block (including transaction fees). The cost of performing a 51% attack is the cost of doing more mining work than the rest of the network combined. The amount of money spent on mining across the whole network should be somewhere near the value being earned in rewards, given that most of the miners are rational.
When the new coin rate halves, the amount of money being spent on mining should roughly half, as should the price of attacking the network.
The other thing to take into consideration is the BTC price. When the value of 1 bitcoin goes up or down, so does the value of the block reward. The network could be more secure after the halving than it is at this moment if the bitcoin price doubles between now and then.
**tl;dr** The halving will affect the security of Bitcoin.

* Go to a bank branch and make a withdrawal (requires an account)
* Go to an ATM and make a withdrawal (requires an account)
* Get cash back at the store register
* Exchange currencies with a stranger on a street corner
Ways to get bitcoin:
1. Get paid in bitcoin
* Go to an exchange and buy bitcoin (requires an account, most require wire transfers)
* Go to a BTM (account requirement depends on BTM)
* I haven't heard of anyone working on a bitcoin-back system yet. That could be an opportunity.
* Exchange currencies with a stranger in a cafe
The ways to get bitcoin aren't fundamentally different than the ways to get cash. Bitcoin is currently harder to obtain than cash because there aren't as many BTMs as ATMs, there aren't very many exchanges to choose from, and as far as I know there is only one [physical branch](
As more exchanges and BTMs crop up bitcoin will become easier to obtain.

The price is a function of supply and demand. Utility, marketing and hype influence adoption. Adoption influences demand. Demand pushes up on the price.
It should be noted that Bitcoin can have high utilitarian value without high monetary value. Take remittances as an example: Juan converts fiat to BTC. He sends the BTC to his sister, Natalia, in Argentina. She converts it to pesos. That transaction works the same and has the same utility whether bitcoin is at $1,000,000/BTC or $1/BTC, all else being equal.

The majority of day to day internal digital currency use in the Philippines will probably be in E-Pesos. But there will still be some who use Bitcoin for various reasons.
_International transactions_: E-Pesos may be just as easy to send internationally as Bitcoin, but Bitcoin already has an international community of users. Initially, at least, there will be more people on the world stage who accept Bitcoin than accept E-Pesos.
_Better tools_: Bitcoin has a strong head start on infrastructure and software. It has an international community of highly motivated and in some cases well funded people working on further development. In theory any piece of open source Bitcoin software could be adapted to E-Peso. But, in practice that takes time and effort. There will be some features available in Bitcoin wallets that aren't available immediately, if at all, in E-Peso wallets.
_Speculation_: Buying bitcoin as a hedge against the value of the peso.

The lesson to take from this is that the point at which a transaction is safe from reversal is when the total miner rewards of all of the confirmations is greater than the amount sent.

P(version)*P(valid_version|version)*P(valid_checksum|version, valid_version)+P(hash)*P(valid_checksum|hash)+P(checksum)*0
* P(version) is the probability of the error being in the version byte
* P(valid_version|version) is the probability of having a valid version number given that the error is in the version number
* P(valid_checksum|version, valid_version) is the probability of having a valid checksum given that the error is in the version and that the version number is a valid version number
* P(hash) is the probability of the error being in the RIPEMD-160 hash
* P(valid_checksum|hash) is the probability of having a valid checksum given that the error is in the RIPEMD-160 hash
* P(checksum) is the probability that the error is in the checksum. Note that if the only error is in the checksum then the address will always be invalid since there is only one valid checksum given the rest of the address. This term is included for completeness.
If the error is random and uniformly distributed then the probabilities are as follows:
* P(version) = 1/25
* P(valid_version|version) = 1/255 Note: There are only two valid version numbers right now, 1 and 3. Since this is a typo we can eliminate the correct one.
* P(valid_checksum|version, valid_version) = 1/256^4 = 1/4,294,967,296
* P(hash) = 20/25
* P(valid_checksum|hash) = 1/256^4 = 1/4,294,967,296
* P(checksum) = 4/25
Which gives:
(1/25)*(1/255)*(1/4,294,967,296)+(20/25)*(1/4,294,967,296) Drop zero term
(1/(5^2))*(1/(3*5*17))*(1/(2^32))+((2^2*5)/(5^2))*(1/(2^32)) Convert numbers to prime factorizations, this helps with simplifying and least common denominators. 
1/((5^2)*(3*5*17)*(2^32))+(2^2*5)/((5^2)*(2^32)) Put denominators and numerators together
1/(2^32*3*5^3*17)+1/(2^30*5) Simplify
1/(2^32*3*5^3*17)+(2^2*3*5^2*17)/((2^30*5)*(2^2*3*5^2*17)) Convert to LCD
1/(2^32*3*5^3*17)+(2^2*3*5^2*17)/(2^32*3*5^3*17) Simplify denominator
(1+2^2*3*5^2*17)/(2^32*3*5^3*17) Add numerators
(1+5100)/(2^32*3*5^3*17) Simplify
5101/(2^32*3*5^3*17) Simplify
5101/27,380,416,512,000 Simplify

The two approaches come down to vote, send message, etc. then hold; or hold then vote, send message, etc.
With the freeze coin approach you can take action sooner. The frozen coin has an expiry.
With the other approach you have to put in waiting time before you can take action, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the situation. Once you have established an identity you can keep using it for as long as you want to leave the coins there. The longer you leave the coins in the address the more you prove that you are serious about this identity and not just a fly-by-night scammer, spammer or troll.
Either way you have the opportunity cost of sitting on coins, whether it's before or after reaping the benefits.

What the market is and isn't figuring into the price depends on people's time horizon. For example, someone planning for retirement in 20 years is going be thinking about what the price will be in 2034 when they plan to start spending their savings. On the other hand, a miner who has to pay a monthly electric bill is going to care about what the price will do in a much shorter time frame.
The degree to which today's price factors in the 2040 mining rate depends on the balance between short term and long term investors.

You are right that both ripe160 and sha256 would have to be compromised to create new public keys for an address that has never been spent from.
Any address that has been spent from has had its original public key revealed which gives you the sha256 hash that when hashed with ripe160 gives the address. If sha256 was cracked to the point of being reversible then you could use the sha256 hash to find a new public key that has the same sha256 hash, and therefore the same address.
[1LcKgyskYiCRU2GHucFdJbCThpCceRxKtt]( (plucked from a recent block) has this public key: 0367fcfe1b6631aab64918d97828872a4699e30cc84fe31725aa696975d55e204c.
The sha256 hash of the public key is: f797361b0b6ca78d2124aaa32e3cd5c5591c655bf3e9a3f848cdce1cd7a1df9c
Which ripe160 hashes to: d7188cb37bc397467c64bf997e69d6ab89ce0f83
If sha256 was reversible then you could find new strings that hash to f797361b0b6ca78d2124aaa32e3cd5c5591c655bf3e9a3f848cdce1cd7a1df9c, which we already know ripe160 hashes to the address we want. No cracking of ripe160 required.
If sha256 ever gets cracked then never reusing addresses would become a matter of security, in addition to any privacy concerns.

In the short term Bitcoin's wild swings make it a pure gamble. In the long term those swings even out a bit. For example, there has not yet been a point in Bitcoin's price history where if you bought, held for two years and sold you would have lost money. That's not to say it won't happen, of course.
You also have to take into account the possibility of Bitcoin being displaced by another cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is, after all, a technology and technologies have a way of being disrupted. The longer you hold the greater the possibility of this happening becomes. Bitcoin is more likely to be disrupted by 2040 than it is to be disrupted by 2020.
Holding short term is immensely risky. But, holding long term also carries its risks.

The way I see it, government is a necessary evil, at least for now. As long as there are positions of power there will be unscrupulous people who do anything they can to get into those positions and abuse them.
We need at least a minimal set of rules to maintain order in society. If there were no rules then there would be nothing saying that someone can't use force against someone else to make them do whatever they want. Even if the only rule is the non-aggression principle, that's still a rule.
There has to be a way to enforce the rules. Rules that aren't enforced are meaningless.
Government provides a way to create, update, and enforce rules.
Bitcoin gives me hope for a better way. The rules are adopted and enforced by the individual users. No central entity is needed. Bitcoin is also an opt-in, voluntary rule set. Almost no one is forcing anyone to use Bitcoin (the exception being ransomware). If you don't like how Bitcoin works you can go create or use an altcoin. Rules are enforced in a non-violent way. If you don't follow the rules you simply get ignored.
I don't know if laws outside of finance and contract law can be decentralized in the same way or not, but I hold out hope. If my neighbor breaks into my house, kills my dog and steals my TV, can that be dealt with by a blockchain?

You should consider using a multi-signature wallet. They are fairly easy to use while also being fairly secure.
[Coinbase's multisig vault]( [GreenAddress]( and [BitGo]( are all services that will hold and protect one key of a 2-of-3* multisig wallet, while you hold the other two. They help protect your coins, but you stay in control.
[Copay]( lets you setup multisig wallets with the keys distributed across multiple devices that you or a trusted friend or family member own.
Armory also has multisig functionality, which is good for offline wallets and cold storage, but that uses Bitcoin Core, which you said you are moving away from, so that's out.
*GreenAddress has an option for 2-of-3 wallets, but their default is 2-of-2 wallets with a time locked transaction that will move your coins out to another wallet in the event that you lose your key or anything happens to GreenAddress.

Bitcoin's killer app is that it is openly programmable money. That means it will only get better.
One of the major things affecting Bitcoin adoption is that the payment network is married to the currency. It would be like PayPal only allowing people to send PayPalBucks. If there was a payment network that had the properties of the Bitcoin network, secure, low cost, trustless, uncensorable, borderless, and openly programmable, that allowed people to send any currency, then adoption of the network would explode. Bitcoin the currency would be a nonstarter. It would never be able to break the network effect of fiat if it wasn't the only currency usable on the payment network.

It looks like they want to do centralized issuance and decentralized transaction processing.

I don't see any way to prove coins are frozen in a trustless way. If you use multisig with an escrow, then the escrow has to be trusted. The community has to trust that the escrow won't release your funds early.
On the other hand it is trivially easy to prove that you have been holding coins for a given amount of time.

[Here]( is a method for using micropayments to buy data.
Basically it works like this:
1. Buyer puts down a deposit with multisig
2. Buyer and seller create a transaction that sends a small part of the deposit to the seller and returns the rest to the buyer
3. Seller sends buyer some data
4. Buyer and seller update the transaction to send the seller slightly more of the deposit.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 for as long as the buyer wants to keep getting data.
6. Seller sends final version of the transaction to the Bitcoin network to finalize payment.

So it goes like this?
customer -USD-&gt; U.K. branch  
Somalia branch -USD-&gt; customer's family
You need a way to get USD from the U.K. branch to the Somalia branch. Using a bank is restrictive. Moving cash physically would be expensive and dangerous.
If there is any kind of USD/BTC market in Somalia you could buy bitcoin in the U.K. and sell it in Somalia to get USD at the Somalia branch. That would depend on the Somalia USD/BTC market having enough liquidity to handle the amount of remittances you want to do.
You could set up a BTM in the Somalia branch to create USD/BTC trade (an [unbanked BTM]( could be useful here) and launch an advertising campaign to get Somalians interested in buying bitcoin. If you can get merchants around your branch to start accepting bitcoin, that would help too.
Bitcoin based remittances won't work until there is demand for bitcoin in the country the money is being sent to.

The wallet software stores and uses the private keys for you. When you tell it to send it creates a transaction, uses private key(s) to sign it, and sends it out to the network.
Most wallets should have an option somewhere to export private keys if you need to. Where exactly that is will depend on the wallet.
Some wallets, such as Armory and Electrum, allow you to get a "seed" that can be used to recreate every key in the wallet. In Armory this takes the form of chunks of four letters each. In Electrum you get twelve words.

Is there any reason not to do a scratchcard?
The qr code doesn't just need to be protected before the card is activated. Someone could take a picture of the qr code, wait until they think someone has activated the card and use the code.
Is the qr code on the back of the cardstock hanger, as seen in [this picture]( the same as the qr code on the card? If it's not, then the hanger would protect the sensitive qr code until purchase, serving some of the same purposes as a scratchcard.
One way or another, after the card has been activated and removed from the hanger and until it's redeemed the qr code must be protected. A scratchcard would make that easier. One of the things a scratchcard does is it signals to the customer "this bit of information is sensitive, protect it." It also says "we are looking out for your security and taking every precaution we can."
Without a scratchcard customers have incentive to rush to redeem. With a scratchcard they will be more likely to put it off. More time before redemption is more time before you have to pay out. It may also increase the rate of people purchasing a card and forgetting to ever redeem it, which is free money to you.
Having a scratchcard would allow people to give/sell/trade the cards to other people with a reliable guarantee that the card hasn't yet been redeemed, in a similar manner to casascius coins (though not nearly as high end). It would increase the resalability of the cards.
One of the ideas behind physical bitcoins was to allow cash like, physical, hand to hand trade. Casascius coins don't work well for that because they are so high end and have such a high collectors value. Your cards could make physical trade of bitcoin backed value a reality.

There are some people around here who see the potential of what Bitcoin could become and are a bit blind to the problems with what Bitcoin is now.
There are other people who see the current problems of Bitcoin and not what Bitcoin can become.
Bitcoin as it stands now has issues. It's hard to securely store. It's hard to get. It's hard to convert back to fiat if you need to. The number of places to spend it is growing, but it's still small. The value is all over the place. Because of all of that, I'm not recommending it to my friends and family.
On the other hand, Bitcoin has the potential to get a lot better. It's open source nature means that anyone can build new tools and come up with new ways to use it. And people are. Among some of the things that have been done or are being worked on include hardware and multisig wallets for greater security, trustless escrow for better customer protection, a decentralized marketplace, a crowdfunding platform, token based website access, microtipping on social media, proof of reserves for exchanges and web wallets, and Bitcoin ATMs.

Let's say I have $20 in USD I want to spend at a Bitcoin accepting merchant. I buy bitcoin and send it to the merchant. The merchant sells the bitcoin and collects USD.
If it takes 2 hours from the time I buy the coins to the time the merchant sells them then that is 2 hours that those coins are tied up. We are producing demand for $20 worth of coins for 2 hours.
If it only takes 1 hour from the time I buy the coins to when the merchant sells them then we are only producing demand for those coins for 1 hour.

I wholeheartedly agree that a multisig wallet like GreenAddress is where it's at. If you look at my comment history you'll see I've been beating that drum a lot today.
I think the confusion here comes from what exactly 2FA means. Multisig is a type of 2 factor authentication on the coins themselves, but it isn't the only type of 2FA. There is also 2FA on account access.
For example, gmail offers 2FA for logins. Gmail could go rouge and send emails from your email address, but for an individual to login to tell gmail to send an email they need both the password and the device that receives the access tokens.
In a similar way Mt.Gox offered 2FA on account access. They had complete control of the coins and were able to disappear with them, but if a thief wanted to login to an account to send Mt.Gox a withdraw request they would have needed both the password and the second factor device.


Coinbase and circle have the same kind of 2FA as Mt.Gox had: 2FA on account access. They don't offer users multsig wallets. They could freeze accounts or disappear with funds just like Mt.Gox did. (I personally see account freezing to be the bigger risk with Coinbase and Circle than loss of funds. They both have insurance to protect against lost funds, but they like to cozy up to the government and would freeze accounts if the government told them to.)

I'm all for multisig. I think it's one of Bitcoin's killer apps. But, using multisig involving the users on an exchange would put each trade on the blockchain and could significantly slow down trading.
*Thinking out loud:*
Multisig could be used for cold storage protection.
Suppose there are services whose model is to provide cold storage reserve protection and assurance. An exchange contracts with two such services. They create a two of three wallet.
The exchange publishes a reserve policy, e.g. 95% of BTC holdings will be kept in the protected wallet, funds moved to the hot wallet can only go to certain addresses, etc. The services only sign transactions that follow the public policy. The exchange only needs to use one of the services for signing for any given transaction.
The exchange gives both services a merkle tree with users' balances. They give users merkle branches they can then take to the services to verify that their funds are included in total. The services verify that there are enough funds in the protected wallet to cover total from the merkle tree. The services publish statements saying that the reserves are in good order and follow the exchange's reserve policy.
If the exchange disappears, users can go to the services with the merkle branch to prove they have a claim on some of the funds. The services work together to sign transactions to divide out the protected funds to the users.
*Insert disclaimer here about this being a raw idea that is probably wrong in many ways. It would have to be hashed out significantly before anyone even thinks of implementing it.*

Simply including a recent block hash in the document doesn't prove much. It would be trivial to take an old document, insert a recent block hash, and then submit it.
If the document is somehow *based* on the block hash, in such a way that the document can't be created without knowing the hash, then you could prove that it didn't exist until a given time.
One application of that would be pseudo-random values used for provably fair gambling. Another would be writing the hash, or part of it, on a paper that you hold up to prove a pic is new.

Securing bitcoins is [getting]( [easier](
Volatility is the last major problem I see with Bitcoin. People like to say that volatility will go down with more adoption, but I think there may be limits to how stable a fixed supply asset can be. Gold has had a 41% difference between the high and low over the last five years. The EUR/USD exchange rate has had a 21% difference between the five year high and low.
Even if stability will come with increased adoption it becomes a bit of a chicken and the egg because volatility is a deterrent to some potential adopters.
I've been looking into Bitshares lately. I like the idea of a market pegged asset that has a supply that can expand and contract with demand. Bitshares is pretty far behind Bitcoin in a lot of areas, though, and the ecosystem is an unholy mess.

If a significant number of users and miners stick with the old rules they will produce and mine transactions that are invalid under the new rules, and a fork will result.
If the old-rule miners are in the minority, they will keep jumping back to the new chain every time the new chain gets longer, and the old-rule miners will lose their money (unless they also hardfork). That's what happened with BIP-66.
But if the miners who refuse to follow the new rules are in the majority, then they will have enough power to maintain a chain of their own. That chain will be given value by users who don't agree with the new rules, and those miners will get paid.
(BTW I think a fork is exactly what Bitcoin needs. Let the two camps each have their own chain and fight it out in the market.)

@_date: 2014-09-11 06:06:57
The biggest problem that I see right now is that it's complicated, inconvenient or expensive to store securely. You either use Armory to do an offline wallet or multisig, which is complicated; use paper wallets, which is inconvenient, as you have to sweep the whole paper wallet to spend it; or use a hardward wallet, such as a Trezor, which is expensive.
What I think would help is a simple and easy to use app that allows you to sync devices and it will generate multisig addresses and pass partially signed transactions automatically. You go into the client on your computer and put in a payment. It pops up on your phone with the details and asks for confirmation. The user doesn't even need to know what multisig is. They just know they need both devices to spend the money.

Right now Bitcoin is a bit difficult/technical to properly secure, and a lot of people are terrible at computer security. I have hope, though, that new easier security methods will be developed.
Multisig seems particularly promising: You have one key on your computer, one on your phone, and one on paper or in the hands of a trusted friend as a back up. Any two out of the three need to be used to make a transaction. If someone hacks into your computer or steals your phone they can't take your bitcoin without getting into the other device.

a) The nonce field is 4 bytes. Each byte has 256 possible values. 256^4 = 4,294,967,296.
b) A combination of difficulty and luck. Each hash is like an independent dice roll. Taking a normal pair of dice as an analogy, a pair of sixes comes up on average once every thirty six rolls. But you might get lucky and get it in just a few rolls, or you might get unlucky and take a hundred rolls.
Upping the difficulty is like adding more dice to match. If you roll five dice the chance of getting all sixes goes down to 1/7,776. The chances of getting it within 36 tries is 0.46%.
Right now the Bitcoin difficulty is such that it takes on average 209,629,760,213,504,459,839 hashes from the whole network for each block. The chances of finding a solution in 4,294,967,296 hashes is 1 in 48,808,231,999.
c) Miners can choose which transaction they include in a block. If they want to they can choose not to include any transactions at all beyond the one that rewards them with new coins. For the first year and a half pretty much all of the blocks were empty simply because there were no transactions to include.

* The version of the protocol that the miner is running
* Hash of the previous block
* The merkle root, which is a hash of the transactions in the block
* A timestamp
* The current difficulty target
* A nonce
The block header is hashed twice to get the block hash. Any change to the above six elements will change the block hash.
Each nonce tried is one shot at getting a block hash that meets the requirements. A miner can start with any nonce and try them in any order. The nonces that fail aren't published, only the one that wins. The simplest method is to start with a nonce of zero and increment by one.
If a miner runs out of nonces for a given block (there are 4,294,967,296 possible nonces) they can change the timestamp or transactions, which will give a whole new batch of hashes, and start trying nonces again.

I really hope that the problems with sidechains are resolved and that they become a reality. They will reduce fragmentation and bring innovation back from the altcoins to Bitcoin. I would love to see Ethereum, CounterParty, Bitshares, and Namecoin all implemented as sidechains.
If sidechains are implemented then the next big controversial change can happen on a sidechain, and those that agree with it can voluntarily choose to migrate without forcing others.
I see sidechains as both an illustration of the problem of centralized development and the solution. With sidechains there can be many competing, yet inter-operable, chains, each with their own dev team. It would open up the possibility of multiple implementations without the need for rigid, bug for bug, compatibility.
All that being said this is a major change and it needs to be handled with the greatest of care.

The global economy runs almost entirely on fiat. Right now the great majority of Bitcoin activity involves converting to or from fiat. Conversion into or out of fiat requires third parties, because fiat requires it.
There is a small, but growing, amount of bitcoin only transactions that are happening. Someone sends someone else bitcoin without either immediately converting into or out of fiat. Many people use third parties like changetip or coinbase for these because they are more convenient. Those people are putting trust in third parties that could freeze or seize funds. But third parties aren't required for bitcoin only transactions. Bitcoin can be sent directly and there is nothing that changetip or anyone else can do to stop it.

@_date: 2015-05-31 18:20:50


The incentives to include transactions are to collect transaction fees and to make Bitcoin usable, which makes it valuable, which makes the bitcoin the miners earn valuable.
The incentive to not include transactions is that bigger blocks take longer to propagate across the network, giving more time for competing blocks to be found and causing the miner to lose out on their reward.


The first transaction in each block is called the "coinbase transaction" or "generation transaction". It assigns the miner the newly generated coins and the transactions fees collected in the block.
It's included in the transaction list with the rest of the transactions, and is part of the merkle root.
For example [block  has [this coinbase transaction](
The word coinbase also refers to a piece of data that the coinbase transaction has in place of an input. The coinbase can be anything. In the coinbase transaction above AntPool used it as a tag: "�yMined by AntPool sc1fȓ UkJ��L�". The coinbase can be treated as an extra nonce by incrementing it each time the regular nonce runs out.

There are two issues that come to mind already on the horizon. The first is sidechains. The second is uncertainty about whether or not transaction fees alone can sustain mining when block rewards taper off.
There will undoubtedly be other issues that crop up over time that we haven't even begun to consider yet.

You don't need every person reviewing, just those that have an interest in the health of the company. You don't even need all of those. If a random sample of people checks a report then the company has incentive to be honest in the whole report, because they don't know which parts will be checked.


Not every company needs to file a solvency report like this, just those that hold money on behalf of their customers.


Publishing a report like this is trivially easy, especially if it's automated. Well worth it to the company for the confidence boost from the customers.
Verifying a report is also trivially easy. It can be done in minutes with tools that are readily available. It is well worth it to the customer to know that their funds are covered.


Then you add a central point of failure that can make mistakes or be corrupted.

Australia is not banning the teaching of encryption. They are banning _export_ of encryption technology. That means that people in Australia can't teach people outside of Australia encryption. Anyone anywhere can teach encryption to people inside Australia.

The U.S. used to have these kinds of restrictions on the export of encryption tech. They rescinded most of them in the nineties when they realized they were impossible to enforce.

The biggest differences I see between LN hubs and legacy payment providers, like Visa and PayPal:
* Barrier to entry: Legacy payment systems are costly to establish and run. That's why there a only a handful of players. Setting up a basic LN hub could be as simple as installing some open source software, dumping some bitcoin in for the channels, and letting it run. Of course there is a lot more than that that could be done to make a hub more reliable and secure, but a basic hub doesn't have to be that fancy.
* Money seizure: Custodial payment systems, including those that hold your bitcoin for you, can take your money. The worst that a LN hub can do is hold it ransom until the timelock expires.
* Potentially pseudonymous: Because a LN micropayment channel has very low trust requirements a hub could be run pseudonymously through Tor. That gives the users more privacy and provides operators mild protection from government shut down.

The Lightning Network isn't centralized. There can be an unlimited number of hubs and no one has to ask anyone's permission to set one up. Starting a hub will require some capital, but small hubs that deal with a couple bitcoins at a time can coexist alongside huge hundred thousand BTC hubs.


Using the Lightning Network isn't mandatory. You will still be able send normal bitcoin transactions.


The Lightning Network will actually be more private. With traditional bitcoin transactions everyone can see the addresses and amounts of every transaction you make. With the Lightning Network the only transactions that are public are the ones used to open and close channels. The only entity that knows what you do with that channel is the one you share it with.
The Lightning Network allows payments to be relayed. It's possible for each hub in the chain to only know the hubs immediately before and after it in the chain, which would mean that none of them know who both the sender and receiver are. It would be like TOR for bitcoin transactions.
Since payment channels are trustless, anonymous hubs can be created. Like in TOR hidden services the user and the hub would not know the identity of each other.


The Lightning Network allows instant, cheap, trustless, full reserve off chain transactions. It allows Bitcoin to scale up while keeping resource use low. Nothing else comes close to matching what it can offer.

Dave gets the 50 bits as credit in his payment channel with Carolbase. With Carolbase's cooperation Dave could close out the channel immediately. (Without Carolbase's cooperation he would have to wait for the channel to time out.) But it makes more sense to keep the channel open to collect several more payments from other people, then close it all out with one settlement transaction. That's where the power of payment channels come in.
Dave could also spend those 50 bits while they are still in the payment channel by crediting them back to Carolbase.

I absolutely believe that we need governance, i.e. rules and the enforcement of those rules, in order to have a peaceful and productive society. Basic game theory makes that pretty clear. Steven Pinker's book *Better Angels of Our Nature* also makes a strong case for it. The Bitcoin protocol works so well because it has iron clad rules that are strictly enforced.
Traditionally governance was only possible through government, i.e. an organization of people who set and enforce the rules. The problem with that is that any human run system is as corruptible as the humans themselves, which is pretty damn corruptible.
Bitcoin gives me a glimmer of hope that we can have a system of governance without corrupt humans in control. But in reality there is a world of difference between Bitcoin and the massively complex system that it would take to replace an entire government.

I find it useful to think of a channel like a checking account. People leave keep their money in bank accounts indefinitely and send and receive payments there.


Again I find the checking account analogy useful. If you want to deposit or withdraw "cash", i.e. bitcoin that isn't in a channel, then it would take a blockchain transaction.
On the other hand if someone sends you a "check", or a channel payment, that could increase your "account balance" without a blockchain transaction.
The difference, though, is that without blockchain transactions the size of a channel stays constant. The potential amount you can pay the hub plus the amount the hub can pay you doesn't change.
If you make more payments than you receive then your side of the channel will run out. You would need a blockchain transaction to top up your side of the channel.
If you want to change the size of a channel then you need a blockchain transaction.
If you send the same amount as you receive, and you're happy with the size of the channel then you could go a long time without any blockchain transactions.

I would put it in a multisig wallet with each key generated offline and stored all over the world where it is hard to get to, even for me.
I would use nLockTime to create transactions that pay out to an easier to access cold wallet over time. I would start out by giving myself small amounts and ramp up over time, so that I have time to learn to how to handle money. That way if I make a stupid mistake early on I don't lose everything.
What exactly I spend it on would be an ever evolving thing as I get a better and better idea of what things are worth my money.
At some point I would invest in some businesses that start earning me more money. I would also use some of my Bitcoin to buy gold, silver, and a few other good stores of value to diversify and hedge against BTC price fluctuations. I would even hold a little bit (not a lot) of fiat.

How do they work?
If bitcoin has any usefulness then there will be people willing to buy bitcoin so they can use it. However much those people value the use they get out of it divided by the number of units in circulation determines the fundamental value.
Example: In 2013 there were [$26.7 billion in remittances to the Philippines]( Let's say, for the sake of an example, that bitcoin captures 0.1% of that. That's $26.7 million/per year. Let's also say that one round trip takes three hours: three transactions (from an exchange to a sender, from the sender to the receiver, from the receiver to an exchange where it is immediately sold to the next sender) at six confirmations each. At this fastest ideal all bitcoins would make 2922 trips per year (365.25 day in a year * 24 hours in a day / 3 hours per trip). At a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in existence that would be a volume 61.362 billion BTC transferred to the Philippines per year. ($26.7 million/per year)/(61.362 billion BTC/year) = $0.000435/BTC (low *but not zero*)
These numbers, of course, are not reality. Bitcoin may capture more or less than that, this is only one market, and the velocity will be much lower than that. Whatever the exact numbers are, though, as long as there are some people using it, there will be a non-zero floor.


Bitcoins can be bought from Coinbase for a 1% fee and sent to the Philippines and converted to Philippine pesos for free using rebit.ph . 1% total fees looks pretty competitive for remittances.


Taken on its own burning money like that is not sustainable. But if the person burning money has other businesses in the space then it can be a loss leader that builds up the bitcoin economy and makes those other businesses profitable.

Multisig is short for multi-signature. There are multiple keys and some subset of them is needed to spend the coins. That way if someone steals one of the keys they can't get the coins without also stealing one of the other keys, which may be very difficult if the keys are held in different places. Because of that multisig offers strong security.
A common scheme is 2-of-3 where there are three keys and any two of them can spend the coins. There are services (GreenAddress, BitGo, Coinbase's Multisig Vault, etc.) that will hold one of the keys for you:
1. Held by the service. They will only sign with it after you log in and verify using 2 factor authentication.
2. Held by you online. It can be stored on your computer or encrypted with a password you provide, stored by the service, and decrypted on your machine when needed.
3. Held by you offline as a backup.
Under normal circumstances keys  and  would be used. If the service disappears or you lose access to your account for some reason you can use  and  to recover the coins. If you forget the encryption password for  then  and  could be used for recovery.
Multisig can also be used to require the agreement of multiple people to spend coins, for example a couple managing savings, or company officers managing corporate funds.

Bitcoin is an open, filterless system by design. The upside of that is that there is no limit to innovation. Anyone with the skills can build new tools, platforms, and systems without waiting for permission. There is a tremendous amount of innovation happening.
The downside is that malicious and/or incompetent people aren't limited either. Anyone can start something, even if they aren't honest or don't have the skills to maintain it.
There isn't a clean line between innovations and shams, either. Pretty much every sham poses as an innovation. Some of them are a good idea that the developer has no idea how to correctly implement. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."
Some of them get up and running and provide a valuable service for a while before collapsing. MtGox, for example, provided an early exchange that helped launch bitcoin and had the lion's share of trade volume for years before going down in flames.
In the short term shams cause a lot of damage. A lot of people lose a lot of money. In the long term the shams will tend to flame out and die and the honest innovations will tend to survive. Right now the open nature of the Bitcoin ecosystem makes it a dangerous place to be, but in twenty years the world will be a better place for it.

There are different things that fall under cryptography:
* Encryption, where a message is encoded in a way that can be decoded with the right key. Useful for passing secret messages and keeping information hidden from prying eyes.
* Digital signatures, where someone signs a message in a way that proves they hold the private key that corresponds to a given public key.
* Hashes, where a message is scrambled in a way that can't be reversed, but can be repeated and verified if you know the original message.
Bitcoin transactions use digital signatures to transfer bitcoins. You prove you hold the private key corresponding to the address and use that key to sign a message saying in effect "These coins now belong to whoever has address ______ ."
They use hashes to obscure public keys. Your address is actually a hash of your public key.
Bitcoin transactions are open for everyone to examine, so they aren't encrypted.
Bitcoin wallets can encrypt private keys before storing them on disc to give them some protection from hackers.

Each channel is a payment relationship between two people. Existing payment channels, like what Streamium uses, end there. What the Lightning Network would introduce is the ability for channels to be chained together to send a payment from one person to another through any number of intermediaries.
Alice comes across Dave's wallpaper site and wants to buy one for 50 bits. Alice doesn't have a payment channel with Dave and doesn't want to set one up because this is a one off payment. Alice does have an existing channel with Bobpay, though. Bobpay has a channel with Carolbase and Carolbase has a channel with Dave. Alice and Dave can create a set of transactions that chain the channels together so Alice pays Bobpay who pays Carolbase who pays Dave.

If it was just about the blockchain technology, you would be right. An unlimited number of blockchains can be started. If they all had an equal market share then the market share per chain would go to 0.
But Bitcoin isn't just the blockchain technology, it's also the network. Bitcoin has a much bigger network effect than any of the other blockchain based currencies. It has better development, stronger security, more liquidity, more infrastructure, more investment and more mindshare than all the other cryptocurrencies combined.
The difference that Bitcoin's network makes is evidenced by the fact that it has a market cap 59 times larger than the next blockchain based runner up, Litecoin.
As long as Bitcoin maintains a strong network effect, and until an altcoin comes along with a killer feature that Bitcoin can't coopt, Bitcoin will maintain the lion's share of cryptocurrency value.

2. The miners know that reverting a fork that way would cause a massive mess and destroy confidence and value, making Bitcoin worth less and leading to them getting paid less.
3. All of the mining power used on the Classic fork would be wasted. The block rewards earned for those blocks would be destroyed.
4. If the miners change their minds and decide they want 1MB after all they have a better way to revert: a new fork.
Here's the difference between reverting to the old fork and a second fork:

In the event of a fork here's who has power:
* The miners decide what does and doesn't get into the blockchain and what fork they want to secure.
* The investors in bitcoin the currency decide which fork to buy or sell, which determines which fork has value.
* Anyone who accepts bitcoin decides which fork to accept.
* The businesses that manage infrastructure, Bitpay, Coinbase, exchanges, BTM companies, etc. decide which fork they want to support. The [Elacoin fork]( is an example where users wanted to fork but an exchange didn't support it.
Non-mining full nodes aren't on that list. They just pass information around, without any way to exert power. The most they can do is refuse to relay certain information, but it is easy to go around them.

Yes, the Bitcoin protocol records values as an integer number of satoshis. Adding decimal places would require a hard fork because it would require changing the definition of 1 to, for example, 0.001 satoshi, instead of 1 satoshi.

With (most) softforks the only ones who absolutely must upgrade are the miners, so using miner support to decide when to activate the fork is appropriate.
With hardforks everyone must upgrade, not just the miners. The amount of mining power supporting a hardfork doesn't tell you if the rest of the network is ready. Unfortunately, accurately measuring how much of the non-mining part of the ecosystem is ready is really difficult.

That depends on what you think the block size limit is for, spam protection or a market control.
The limit was originally created to keep people from creating a massive block to overload the network. The limit of what the network is able to handle is based on the technology available. Since tech gets better over time and not worse, what the network can handle should only improve.

Defining 1 XBT as the exact price 1 bottle of Diet Coke would be an arbitrary and awkward unit. The number of satoshis in an XBT and the number of XBT in 1 BTC need to be a power of 10 to keep conversions simple.
Right now mBTC is a reasonable unit for everyday purchases. A bottle of Diet Coke runs about 6 mBTC. If the value of bitcoin flatlined and stayed where it is at right now, then 1 XBT = 1 mBTC would be reasonable.
However, if bitcoin continues to go up with increased adoption, then the time will come when people are paying 0.006 mBTC for things and the arguements over changing the base unit will come up again. If we leapfrog to 1 XBT = 1 uBTC, then we have a lot longer before we need to change the base unit again.

Should the protocol be responsible for every bug in every contract? There will be more buggy contracts. That's the danger of Turing completeness.


That was a bug in the protocol. It was rolled back to fix what should have been an invalid transaction, one that violated one of Bitcoin's most fundamental promises: the 21 million coin limit.
That's not an ongoing problem because the protocol was patched to keep that from ever happening again.
I don't know much about the DAO hack, but from the limited reading I've done (correct me if I'm wrong) it sounds like it was a contract following the protocol yet not acting as intended. In that way it's more like the transactions where people accidentally pay [outrageously high fees]( Those kinds of transactions clearly aren't what was intended. They don't get rolled back. If the sender is fortunate the miner may return their fee in a separate transaction. Even that doesn't always happen.

Antpool does secure the network in that scenario because Antpool finds two blocks. Those two hashes that hit the target are what it's all about. They make it all worth it. The other hashes are thrown away as soon as it's known that they don't meet the target.
The other hashes are worth going through because that is the only way to find the ones that hit the target. If Antpool could find hashes that hit the target without computing any of those that don't you can bet your ass they wouldn't waste energy on useless hashes.

Right now BCH and BTC have the same difficulty. (That will change in a few blocks when BCH's difficulty drops.) Wincent has mined ten BCH blocks. Pointing the same hashpower at BTC he would expect to get about the same number of blocks.
Bitcoin is averaging about 1.3 BTC in fees per block. (12.5 + 1.3)*10 = 138 BTC in opportunity cost by not mining BTC.
Looking at [here]( to see which BCH blocks he mined and [here]( to see how much he got in fees he got a total of 2.2248186 BCH in fees. That plus 12.5*10 = 127.2248186 in BCH.
According to [coinmarketcap]( 1 BCH is worth 0.136 BTC. 127 BCH * 0.136 BTC / BCH = 17.1 BTC

People who had BTC in Greenaddress 2-of-2 wallets at the time of the BCH fork are up a creek without a paddle as far as getting BCH goes. Greenaddress won't sign BCH transactions and the time locked transactions they provide don't work on BCH because of strong replay protection.
Greenaddress also offers 2-of-3 wallets, where they have one key and you have two (one is a back up). People with those can get their BCH without Greenaddress' cooperation.
Segwit2x isn't implementing strong replay protection, so the time locked transactions can be used to get it.
Whether or not you will be able to get any future forked coins out of a Greenaddress 2-of-2 will depend on if the fork has strong replay protection.

I don't know about that. Though I haven't done the statistical analysis, I would guess that most of the high fees come from high value transactions. If you want to send 20 mBTC, then a 2 mBTC fee is outrageous. But, if you want to send 100 BTC then a 2 mBTC fee is trivial. LN isn't suitable for high value transactions and it won't do anything to stop them from driving up transaction fees. What it will do is make it practical to make small transactions despite high mining fees.

There is a limit to how much the difficulty can change each adjustment. It can go up or down by a factor of four at most.

It worked the same way with altcoins and bitcoin forks.  In the early days there were only a couple altcoins.  Then as more people realized how easy it was to create an altcoin, more and more came along.  Now there are countless altcoins.  There were a few early bitcoin forks that didn't get much attention.  Then BCH came along and got a lot of attention.  People realized forks are a thing and a bunch sprang up.

That's true if the bus always leaves exactly two minutes apart. The variation in block times means that you are more likely to generate a transaction during longer block times. That stretches out the wait time.
[Here]( are 100 random block times and 100 random transaction times (enough for a decent sample size). The block times were generated by counting the number of tries it takes for a random number between 1 and 600 to be 1, and using that as the number of seconds. The average wait time comes out close to ten minutes.

It was zero. Since blocks were nowhere near full, and miners were getting plenty from new coins, the only reason for fees was to protect against spam. As long as a transaction was high enough in value, small enough in data size, and long enough since the coins moved last you could send it for free.*
If you look through the blocks from back then you will find a lot of transactions with no mining fee at all. [Here is a randomly chosen block from 2011.]( It doesn't have a single transaction that paid a fee. There are many more like it.

I'm not sure that's correct. At any given time the expected time until the next block is ten minutes, regardless of how long it has been since the last block.
Edit: A block with more time since the last block will have more transactions generated in that time. That means that transactions will tend to be generated during long blocks, increasing the wait time from what you are expecting.

A LN channel is the Bitcoin equivalent of a checking account. When you open one checking account with one bank you get the ability to send and receive money with everyone that bank is networked with. You can then walk into any random store and make a payment. You pay your bank, your bank pays their bank, and their bank pays them. All of that happens behind the scenes when you swipe you debit card.
The Lightning Network works in a similar way. When you open a channel with someone it allows you to transact with everyone in the same network by relaying payments. For example, let's say you want to buy something once from Bob's Widgets. Let's say you have a channel with Coinbase, Coinbase has a channel with Bitfinex, and Bob has a channel with Bitfinex. When you go to pay, behind the scenes you pay Coinbase, Coinbase pays Bitfinex and Bitfinex pays Bob.
There are a couple important differences between a LN channel and a traditional bank account, though. The biggest one is that a LN channel is non custodial. You keep control of your coins. The other big difference is that anyone can open a LN channel with anyone. Instead of going through Coinbase and Bitfinex to pay Bob, you might have a friend who has a friend who has a friend who is friends with Bob.

I say those results are encouraging, not disappointing.
Volume is relevant economically, but not technically. A one million BTC transaction takes up exactly the same amount of space on the blockchain as a one millibit transaction with the same number of inputs and outputs. The difference is that the one million BTC transaction can afford a much higher fee to get on the chain.
The percent of transaction done over Lightning is what matters for scale, not the percent of BTC.

Do you have a bank account with a debit card? How many payments have you made with the one account? A Lightning Network channel is the Bitcoin equivalent of a checking account.
When you open a checking account it doesn't just give you the ability make payments to the bank. It gives you the ability to make payments to anyone in the banking network routed through your bank. It also allows other people to pay you through the same network.
When you open a LN channel you don't just get the ability to pay the person you open the channel with. You get the ability to make and receive payments with anyone in the whole network interconnected network.

After several weeks, during which user patience is put to the test.


The equilibrium is for the amount of hashing power on a chain to be proportional to the value of the rewards the miners are getting. If there is more hashing power than that then the difficultly will be too high and some miners will leave, bringing the hashing power and difficulty down. If there is less hashing power than that then the difficulty will be low, attracting miners, and bringing the hashing power and difficulty up.
If fork A has X times as much value as fork B it should have roughly X times as much hashing power.


Users aren't hostages of the miners. They do have a symbiotic relationship. All else being nearly equal, users should choose the more secure chain.


The rate of the mining subsidy is one of the most sacred parts of the Bitcoin social contract. It is the foundation of Bitcoin's value proposition. A fork that respects that, but has less mining power is far more attractive than a fork that breaks that but has more mining power.
The blocksize limit isn't a fundamental part of the social contract. It's an arbitrary value that can be changed without fundamentally changing Bitcoin. How many users do you think are so dedicated to a 1 MB limit that they would stay on a weaker fork to keep it?

If you only have one channel you may be able to access the network through your counterparty, but they won't be able to route anything through you. You will be a dead end to them. If neither of you have any other channels then you aren't connected to the larger network at all.
If you have at least two channels then you can route payments from one to the other, making your channels much more useful for everyone. If you have three or more, then it opens up options for different ways to route money through you.
The more people have at least three channels, the more complex, versatile and useful the network is.

Miner support means plenty.
The fork with the most mining power behind it is the most secure. If the chain splits into forks with 75% and 25% mining power, the one with 25% will have 40 minute block times for weeks until the next difficulty adjustment. If the weaker chain has less than 25% by the split (which is completely possible), then it will have even longer block times before readjustment.
Further, miners are incentivized to mine on the most valuable fork. They aren't likely to adopt XT unless they have good reason to believe that the XT fork will have economic support.
Both users and miners have incentive to be on the same fork. Where the users go the miners will follow, and vice versa.

That's a dodge. Beliefs affect decisions. In this case the belief affects the decision of whether or not to support a fork that increases the block size limit.
This is the argument you seem to be making (please correct me if I am mischaracterizing):
* Premise 1: "A chain that ends in centralization and censorship... is much weaker in my opinion."
* Premise 2 (implied): BitcoinXT would lead to centralization and censorship.
* Conclusion: The BitcoinXT fork will be much weaker.
My question was an attempt to pin down what you think about the implied premise.


Fair enough. How do you propose we do that?


Without an increase in blocksize we will run into capacity issues. Here is research from Tradeblock on Bitcoin's capacity vs. demand: [Part 1]( [Part 2]( [Part 3]( [Part 4]( [Part 5]( [Part 6](
Part 4 shows that if the limit is not raised then transactions are likely to be delayed by 1 block on average by July 2016 and 20 blocks on average by December 2016.

I'm sorry for losing my patience. Let me take a step back.
You are right that the Tradeblock model has flaws. Every model does. Every model has assumptions that have to be true for the conclusions to hold. There is a saying that ["All models are wrong but some are useful."](
That doesn't mean that a model is "shitty", just that it has its limits that have to be understood.
The assumption in Tradeblock's model is that nothing changes. You are right that that assumption is likely to be wrong and something will probably change between now and then. The usefulness of the model is showing that something has to change if we want to prevent capacity problems.
The question then becomes What will change?
Here are the possibilities that I see:
* The blocksize limit gets increased.
* Another scaling solution, such as the Lightning Network, gets deployed.
* Transactions move off chain to trusted third parties, like changetip.
* Adoption stalls.
I think we can agree that stalled adoption would be a bad thing. Moving transactions off chain to trusted third parties wouldn't be any better than legacy finance.
The Lightning Network will take time to fully develop and deploy. It will require its own soft fork. I find it unlikely that it will be deployed and widely adopted by the later half of 2016; but I would love to be proven wrong about that.

If you used a web wallet then the coins are almost certainly gone. A lot of web wallets from that time disappeared taking their users' bitcoin with them. Blockchain.info is still around, but that wasn't launched until 2011-08-30, about three weeks after your coins were sent to your wallet.

If you add new a rule it's a soft fork. Only people that care about the new rule have to adopt it. For everyone else the rules they are following are still being followed. Example: Let's say the rule is you can only wear primary colors. A group of people of people decide they only want to wear blue. The rest of the people don't care because the group is still wear a primary color.
A hard fork removes a rule. Everyone has to adopt a hard fork for it to work. If the rule is that everyone must wear blue and someone wants to change the rule to allow wearing any primary color, then everyone who enforces the rules has to accept the change.
Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn proposed a hard fork that would lift the maximum block size from 1 MB to 8 MB. It was rejected from the Bitcoin Core client, the current de facto "official" version of Bitcoin.
Hearn has a fork of Core called Bitcoin XT. It is a nearly identical clone of Core, but with a few small changes. Gavin and Hearn released a version of XT that includes code for the hard fork. The change would become active once 750 of the last 1000 blocks include a version number that indicates that the miner supports the change.

Part of that may be based on people who have 1X futures tokens and don't want to wait for the exchange to declare the contract closed. In order to get that money out sooner they have to recombine 1X and 2X tokens back into BTC, which they can then withdraw.
2X should have a small value based on the time value of the money tied up in 1X.

It involves a combination of more block space, and making more efficient use of the space we have. Things like Schnorr signatures and MAST can make transactions smaller. But even with all the efficiency boosts we can get block sizes will have to be bigger eventually if we want to support mainstream adoption. The big question is when and by how much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:14:29


That's exactly what this is. If you have a group of 20 people who want to open 100 channels between them (the example given in the paper) that would 100 on chain transactions to open with basic LN. With this it only takes 1. Taking into account transaction sizes this approach takes 1/10th as much blockchain space (and therefore fees) per channel as basic LN. If Schnorr signatures are added it's cut down to 1/25 as much.
Once a group is created channels can be opened, closed, and adjusted between members of the group without any additional on chain transactions.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. The fork will happen on block 494784. The next adjustment will be 1152 blocks later at block 495936. Until a given fork reaches that block it will be mining at the same difficulty, despite having less hashpower.
If 1X gets 10%\* of the pre-fork mining power it will take ten times as long for each block. 10 minutes x 10 = 100 minutes per block
100 minutes per block x 1152 blocks = 115200 minutes to the next adjustment on the 1X chain. That comes out to 80 days.
80 days after the projected fork date of November 15th is February 3.
\*1X will be getting more than 10% of the hashpower. [Over the last week]( 17% of the blocks were non-NYA. Over the last day 23% were non-NYA. Not all of the miners signalling NYA will mine 2X. ViaBTC, for example, said they ["will only offer bitcoin mining on the original bitcoin chain to begin"]( despite signalling support for NYA. That's 12% right there.

Gold is a good store of value, but a good store of value isn't necessarily a good medium of exchange. Being a store of value and being a medium of exchange are two separate things. Store of value: If I hold onto this how valuable will it be in the future? Medium of exchange: How easily can I use this as payment for goods or services?
Central banks are treating gold as a store of value, not a medium of exchange. They are holding it in their vaults, not taking it down to walmart to buy socks.
Another example: real estate. Real estate can be a great store of value, but no one is even thinking of directly using it to pay for cups of coffee.
On the other hand fiat is a good medium of exchange, but a bad store of value. You can easily use to pay for just about anything with little hassle. But it loses value over time through inflation.
Bitcoin can be valuable without being a great medium of exchange. It can have high transaction fees and still be worth holding. Someone who buys $100,000 dollars worth of BTC and holds it for 20 years without spending any, then sells it all to go toward their retirement, doesn't care if there are $100 dollar transaction fees.
I think Bitcoin will become a good medium of exchange once the Lightning Network comes along, but it doesn't have to be to be a good store of value.

There are three things that need to be distinguished:
1. **The file.** This is the actual data. Putting this in the blockchain could be expensive depending on how big the file is.
2. **The hash.** This is the fingerprint of the file. It just says "This file existed." It is impossible to recover the file from the hash alone.
3. **A link.** This is a pointer to somewhere else where you may be able to get the file. "The file is over there." A link can be broken if the file it points to is removed. A hash can be used as a link if the file is in a filesystem that is aware of the hash. There have already been links to CP put in the blockchain. I highly doubt those links still work.
Most methods of "storing files in the blockchain" don't put the actual files in the blockchain. They put a hash and possibly a link in the blockchain. The actual files are delivered to interested parties through some other channels. You can run a full node without participating in those external channels or downloading those extra files.

Until the difficulty adjusts it doesn't matter how many miners are mining each chain. For the first 1152 blocks each chain takes the same amount of work per block. The expected number of blocks found by putting the same amount of hashpower towards either chain is the same. For every block found on 2X the miner would expect to find one block on BTC had they pointed their mining power at it.

Without off chain transactions you have to sacrifice one of the four:
* Fast transactions
* Low fees
* Scale
* Decentralization
In the beginning Bitcoin had fast transactions, low fees, and decentralization, but didn't yet have scale.
As scale went up users had to choose between losing fast transactions or losing low fees.
Increasing the blocksize without doing anything else would sacrifice decentralization for fast transactions, low fees and scale.
Off chain solutions like the Lightning Network and sidechains may be able to get us all four.

There are a host of businesses that care how the protocol affects their business models. Any significant change to the protocol will have winners and losers.
There are many people who care about how Bitcoin could affect the broader political scene. Early adoption was driven in no small part by political conviction.

What OP is proposing is more like recycling than printing new money: Old coins are destroyed and new coins are mined to exactly replace them. The 21 million coin limit stays intact.

The Lightning Network is peer to peer. Anyone can form a payment channel or payment group with anyone else. Want to create a payment channel with your friend Bob? Do it. Want to create a payment group with your poker buddies? Do it.
Big hubs may attract a lot of users, but they don't have a monopoly on the Lightning Network. If a big hub starts acting shitty to its users, they can leave and use the six degrees of separation to route around it.
The payment groups introduced in this paper make it even better because they make it easier adjust or close problem payment channels.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:01:18
You can close the channel factory layer without closing the channels it created. So if you want your money out of a channel shared with a down node you publish the allocation transaction, which acts as the closing transaction of the channel factory and the opening transaction of the channels, and you publish the closing transaction for that specific channel. The other channels remain open.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:02:54
I think the confusion might be coming from what it means for a channel to be symmetric.
The definition you are using, that balances on both sides have to be the same not only isn't part of LN, it goes against the way LN fundamentally works. Channel payments work by changing the balance of who was what share of the combined pot. That balance can start at anything and end at anything, as long as it totals up to the same amount.
The definition of symmetric used in payment channel papers is about what direction payments can go in.
In early versions of payment channels payments could only go one way. They could be used, for example, to pay by the second for streaming. If I want to pay to watch your stream I could put all the funds into the channel in advance, then sign over a larger and larger share of them to you as you send me the stream.
But what if you want to pay me back? Then we need a more complicated payment channel that either of us can update to pay the other. That is what is meant by symmetric: payments can go in either direction.

Let's say Alice, Bob, and Charlene each put in 1 BTC to form a group with these payment channels:
|Party 1|Party 2|Channel Total|
Alice 0.5 | Bob 0.5 | 1
Alice 0.5 | Charlene 0.5 | 1
Bob 0.5 | Charlene 0.5 | 1
Charlene spends all of her money and Alice spends the 0.5 BTC in her channel with Bob. Now the channels look like this:
|Party 1|Party 2|Channel Total|
Alice 0 | Bob 1 | 1
Alice 1 | Charlene 0 | 1
Bob 1 | Charlene 0 | 1
Alice wants to move her money from her channel with Charlene to her channel with Bob, so she can continue paying Bob in the future. But she can't route that payment through Charlene, because Charlene doesn't have any way to pay Bob. In this case there is no way to rebalance Alice's channels through regular LN payments.
By reallocating the channels, Alice can move her funds into a channel with Bob without going through Charlene:
|Party 1|Party 2|Channel Total|
Alice 1 | Bob 1 | 2
Bob 1 | Charlene 0 | 1
Without groups that would require on chain transactions to close the channel with Charlene and update the total in Alice and Bob's channel.

It doesn't work like that. The LN funds go into a 2-of-2 multi signature address that requires a signature from your key and a signature from the other person's key. Since you don't have the other person's key there is no way for you to send that money to another address without either their cooperation, or a transaction they have already signed.

It's well worth a read.
Groups add an extra layer of privacy.
With a basic LN channel the network as a whole knows when channels are opened and closed when the respective transactions are put on the blockchain. The public doesn't know each individual payment that happened on the channel in the meantime.
With groups, the group knows when channels are allocated or reallocated (the group equivalent of opening and closing channels). The group doesn't know what payments happen inbetween. The wider network only knows when the group opens or closes a channel factory. It doesn't know what channels existed within the group in the meantime.

A soft fork introduces a new rule. It makes something that used to be valid, invalid. That means that miners running the old version are invalid to miners on the new version. It's the miners running the old, now invalid version, and new version miners not checking that is causing the problem.
A hard fork relaxes the rules. It makes something valid that wasn't before. That means that blocks mined using an old version would still be considered valid by miners running the new version. So this problem shouldn't happen with a hard fork.

You know how a debit card can be used to make one off payments to a lot of different people and places? On the back end the money is routed from you to the person you are paying through a number of entities: You -&gt; your bank -&gt; clearing house -&gt; their bank -&gt; them. Your bank account is a relationship between you and your bank, but it allows you to pay anyone your bank is connected to.\*
The Lightning Network works in a similar way. A LN payment channel allows you to route payments to anyone connected to the same network, through a chain of connected people.
Example: Sam works at Walmart. He has a payment channel with Walmart, that Walmart uses to pay him his wages. Franny regularly shops at Walmart and gets coffee from Starbucks. She has channels with both. Sam's brother, Dave, also regularly gets coffee at Starbucks and has a channel with them. Sam wants to pay Dave. Sam can route a payment to Dave through Walmart, Franny, and Starbucks. Sam pays Walmart, Walmart pays Franny, Franny pays Starbucks, and Starbucks pays Dave. All of that happens using already existing payment channels. The magic of the underlying smart contracts make all that happen in a trustless way that no one can cheat.
Tomorrow Sam can pay Julie, who plays poker with Dave; or Becky, Franny's roommate; or James who also works at Walmart; or any number of other people he can reach through the six degrees of separation.
*Note: While a LN channel is similar to a bank account in that it allows you to route payments, that's where the analogy ends. With a bank account you hand your money over to the bank. With a LN channel you keep full control of your own money. You can only open a bank account at a bank. LN channels can be opened with anyone.

Here's what will happen if the blocksize limit is increased:
1. The backlog of unconfirmed transactions will be cleared out. (good for nodes, bad for DoSers)
2. Low fee transactions will confirm faster. (good for users, good for anyone trying to get junk into the blockchain)
3. Rational users will drop their fees. (good for users)
4. Low value use cases, microtransactions, etc., will become more economical.
5. Low value use cases will increase. This includes "legitimate" microtransactions as well as transactions meant to get junk into the blockchain without necessarily DoSing Bitcoin.
6. Attackers trying to DoS Bitcoin may or may not give up. If they do give up, that kind of spam will decrease. If they don't give up, then they will have to step up the number of transactions they produce to have the same effect, in which case transactions go way up.
7. If the increase in "legitimate" transactions and blockchain junk outweigh the decrease in DoS spam, average blocksize will increase. (bad for nodes, bad for miners)
The blocksize increase isn't a black and white issue. There are positives and negatives. I personally believe that the increase needs to happen and that the benefits outweigh the risks, but that doesn't mean that there aren't tradeoffs.

Congratulations, you've just walked into the schoolyard "I can do that. I just don't want to."
You won't do anything because setting up enough mining power to replace the miners signalling for S2X would take millions of dollars and a significant amount of time to install. Replacing 80% of the mining power is not trivial, nor should it be. That's the point of mining: It's supposed to be prohibitively expensive to produce a large percentage of the total mining power. If it wasn't then Bitcoin would be vulnerable to 51% attack.

Basic LN needs on chain transactions to open and close each channel, which are subject to fees and/or confirmation waits. Basic LN can greatly increase the number of transactions possible, but at some point there will be too many channel opening and closing requests for the blockchain to handle.
This new layer allows whole groups of people to get into the Lightning Network with one opening and closing transaction per group. If you have a group of 20 people that want to open 100 channels between them (taking the example from the paper) that would take 100 opening transactions and eventually 100 closing transactions between them. With the new layer it would only take 1 opening transaction and 1 closing transaction to cover all of them. Taking into account transaction sizes it comes out to 10 times more blockspace efficiency than basic LN. With Schnorr signatures it bumps up to 25 times as efficient. (The math is laid out in the paper.)
Once a group is established they can open, close and adjust channels between their members off chain, making it even more efficient. See [here]( for a basic example of a three person group scenario that would require two extra on chain transactions with basic LN that aren't required with the extra layer.

There is no way to enforce that. If a miner mines an empty block there is no way to know for sure whether they have an empty mempool or not.

There's two different kinds of fees you're dealing with here, mining fees and exchange fees.
Mining fees are what you pay to get your transaction into the blockchain when you send from one bitcoin address to another. It's based on the data size of your transaction. The more bytes your transaction is the more you have to pay to get it confirmed. Segwit makes the effective size of transactions smaller, and therefore lowers the mining fee.
Exchange fees are what an exchange like Coinbase charges to buy or sell on their platform. They are a business and need to make money, and that is how they do it. It can be whatever rate Coinbase wants to charge that they think their customers will pay. It doesn't have any direct connection to segwit. As for what you can do about exchange fees, not much. You can either accept Coinbase's fees or not use them.

Take a look [here]( It shows the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed over time, organized by fee rate. Each color band is a range of fees, in satoshis per byte, as seen in the box on the left. If you click on one of the fee ranges in that box, it hides everything below, so you can what a transaction with that fee is competing with.
At the moment, transaction between 20-40 satoshis/byte are being confirmed in about an hour to two hours. The average transaction is 226 bytes. So a decent fee is 4520 to 9040 satoshis = 0.00004520 to 0.00009040 BTC = 0.0452 to 0.0904 millibits ~= 0.48 to  0.96 CAD.

I don't know if this applies to HitBTC, but on some of the futures markets 1X futures are stuck while the exchanges wait to see if anything will happen. That could be as late as December 31.

Bitcoin isn't stored in accounts, where the blockchain keeps track of a single balance for each address. It is stored in "unspent transaction outputs" (UTXOs), where each output has a value and an address (well a script, actually, but that's another topic).
A UTXO can be thought of like an envelope of cash, with the address on the front. A transaction takes one or more envelopes, proves that the person/people opening them control(s) the addresses, tears them open, and redistributes the cash to new envelopes.
The new envelopes can't hold more in total than the old envelopes that were destroyed, but they can hold less. Any cash that doesn't make it into an envelope is collected by the miner as the transaction fee.
That's why change addresses are so important. If I want to pay you 0.1 BTC, but all I have is an envelope holding 1.0 BTC then I have to create two new envelopes. One with the 0.1 BTC and your address on it, and one with one of my addresses for the other 0.9 BTC (minus the transaction fee). If I forget to include my change output in the transaction, then the miner will get the unclaimed 0.9 BTC as a big transaction fee. There have been a couple of people that have lost as much as 20 BTC that way. (They were creating transactions by hand, which is playing with fire. Wallets will automatically handle change for you, so you don't have to worry about it.)
Double spending is creating two transactions that spend the same output, regardless of how much the address may have in other outputs.
Let's say I have an address that controls a total of 3 BTC in 3 UTXOs, with each UTXO holding 1 BTC. We'll call the UTXOs A, B, and C. If I create one transaction that spends A and sends the money to you, and another transaction that spends A and sends to someone else, then that is a double spend. Only one of those two transactions will be accepted. It doesn't matter that the same address controls other outputs that could cover the amount for both. The two transactions only authorize the spending of UTXO A. In order to spend UTXO B or C I would have to create a whole new transaction that spends one of those specifically.

It can route payments across chains. A possible routed payment could be: Alice pays Bob in Bitcoin, Bob pays Dave in Litecoin, Dave pays Ester in Vertcoin, and Ester pays Fran in Bitcoin.
It can be used for trustless exchange: Alice pays Fran in Bitcoin and Fran pays Alice in Litecoin

As the saying goes "If you don't hold the private keys you don't own the coins." Paper bitcoin already exists as account balances on exchanges and payment processors and such.
Exchanges can, and have, used fractional reserve. There have been major collapses because of exchanges not having the reserves to cover their liabilities. The most infamous example is MtGox.
The difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin is much easier to verify that the reserves exist and to take possession. If this is something you are concerned about (and you should be) insist on keeping your coins either in a place that does regular proof of reserve (and check it) or keep them in your own wallet.

There are two ways a transaction gets included in a block normally: by fee or by priority. (This is the default behaviour in Bitcoin Core, but miners are free to use any method they want to choose transactions.)
The first 50,000 bytes are filled with the highest priority transactions, regardless of fee. Priority is calculated as the size of the inputs in satoshis times the age of the inputs in number of confirmations, divided by the size of the transaction in bytes.
The rest of the block is filled based on fee per byte. A 250 byte transaction with a 0.0001 fee is considered the same as a 500 byte transaction with a 0.0002 fee. Both are 40 satoshis/byte. Both will be included before a 500 byte transaction with a 0.0001 fee (20 satoshis/byte).
Whether a transaction is getting in on priority or in on fee, having a smaller size is better, other things being equal.

The older the inputs in a transaction the higher the priority. So your transaction should gain priority over time.
A possible caveat would be if miners only calculate the priority once when they first receive a transaction. (I have no idea if they do or not.) If that's the case then they could still be treating it like a low priority transaction.

A hash is a mathematical function that takes a piece of data in one end spits out a short, random looking piece of data (the hash) on the other end. You can think of a hash as an ID tag for specific data.
Hashing is designed to have these properties:
* The same piece of data in always produces the same hash.
* Changing the data even slightly completely changes the hash.
* Figuring out the data from the hash alone is, for all intents and purposes, impossible.
* Finding two different pieces of data that have the same hash is FAIAP impossible.


A hashing function like SHA-256 is just a mathematical process that anyone can run. SHA-256 itself doesn't have any passwords, just math.
It is possible to use a password or secret key with SHA-256 by attaching the key to the end of the data you are hashing. But that would be a key that you generate yourself and only you know.

BIP-66 is a new rule that is stricter about cryptographic signatures.
The new rule kicked in when 95% of miners signalled that they would follow and enforce it. 5% of miners were still using the old rules. That was expected. The 95% running the new rules were supposed to just ignore the 5%.
But about half of the miners weren't checking that new blocks followed the rules at all. They were building off of blocks from the 5% that were still using the old rules. The other half of the miners were rejecting those blocks, causing a blockchain split.


SPV clients only check that a transaction made it into the longest blockchain. They don't check that the blockchain is actually following the rules.


The devs say that SPV clients should wait an extra 30 confirmations to be sure that a transaction made it into the right chain.


No, people are working hard to get this solved. Miners that mine on the wrong chain waste their mining power and don't get a reward. They have a big incentive to start making sure they are on the right chain.

2-of-2 multisig would be safer against theft, but less safe against lost keys. An attacker has to get both keys in order to steal coins from a 2-of-2. But you only have to lose one key to lose access to your coins.
2-of-3 would be significantly safer. That way an attacker still has to get two keys to steal you coins, but you can still recover if you lose access to one key.
You could do one Electrum on-line, one Electrum off-line, and the third back up key as an offline paper print out.

Under certain assumptions market cap can be meaningful, but those assumptions don't hold for cryptocurrencies.

If anyone valued their shares less than the market rate then they would sell them, bringing the market rate down. The total subjective value could be more than the market cap, but in an efficient market it shouldn't be less.
But we know that not all crypto coins can be moved, let alone sold. Market cap doesn't take into account lost keys or shitcoins with inflated numbers.

Your transaction has a low fee and low priority. Priority is higher for transactions that move a lot of bitcoin that hasn't moved in a while, and transactions with small data size. Your transaction doesn't move very much money, so it isn't very high priority.


Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn have been pushing for bigger blocks, which would allow more transactions to be processed, but put a greater load on miners and nodes.
Peter Todd is pushing for replace by fee, where you can create a duplicate transaction with a higher fee to get it confirmed faster. The downside of that is it makes 0 confirmation payments, which many merchants rely on, completely insecure.

A sidechain isn't inseparable from the main chain.
A possible scenario:
1. Most payments happen on a particular sidechain. A few high value transactions, with high fees, happen on the original chain, enough to secure the original chain. The sidechain becomes dominant for everyday use, even if it isn't dominant for total value or mining power.
2. Almost all value and use migrate to the sidechain. The original chain sees very little use. Merge mining means miners can still mine the original chain at next to no extra cost, while collecting the small extra revenue that comes from what little use it still gets. The sidechain is dominant in use and value, but not necessarily in security.
3. After becoming the dominantly used chain, the sidechain severs its peg, and possibly its merge mining, with the original chain. The sidechain has now become independant and doesn't care about the security, or even the continued existence, of the original chain. The ~~sidechain~~ new main chain has become dominant in every way.

That's what multisig escrow is for. The buyer send the money to a 2-of-3 multisig address with keys held by the buyer, the seller, and a trusted arbitrator. If everything goes well the buyer and seller cooperate to send the money to the seller, or back to the buyer in the event of a refund. In the event of a dispute the arbitrator hears both sides, then sides with one or the other. The arbitrator and the winning party together sign a transaction sending the money to the winner.
Once the funds are in the escrow address no one involved can take the money without the cooperation of one of the other two.

Bitcoin is the gorrilla in the room. It has the biggest network effect of any cryptocurrency by far. The point of sidechains is to allow new blockchains for experimenting while staying part of that network effect. Sidechaining against Bitcoin makes more sense than sidechaining off of an altcoin.
Also, a number of the developers of sidechains are Bitcoin Core developers. I think it's a safe bet that they aren't planning on using them on Litecoin before Bitcoin.

This is a case for some Bayes reasoning:
How many people in the world are the real Satoshi? One, or maybe a small group. 
Of those, what are the chances that one of them would be behaving like this? Slim
How many people are narcissists? A lot.
Of those how many want attention and attack anyone who questions them? Most of them.
So people who are not Satoshi greatly outnumber real Satoshis in the pool of narcissistic attention seekers.
Conclusion: A given narcissistic attention seeker is overwhelmingly unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto.

Each block commits to the block immediately before it, which commits to the block before that and so on back to the Genesis Block. Each new block adds another layer of security to all the blocks that came before. The blocks immediately after the Genesis Block had the lowest difficulty but they are the most secure because they have the entire blockchain reaffirming them.
Mining a block does nothing for the security of future blocks, though, since multiple competing blocks can all claim to follow the same parent block. If the difficulty dropped significantly the last few blocks of the chain wouldn't be very secure regardless of what difficulty came before.

When BCH split off of Bitcoin last year, to be followed by the failure of the 2x fork, it showed how resilient Bitcoin is to compromise attempts. It showed that the users of Bitcoin have the power despite what the miners and businesses want. As a result it shot up.
When BCH split it only showed how centralized BCH and its offspring are. When Roger mustered more hashpower than the entire BCH network had earlier that morning, then [bragged about it on twitter]( decentralization was clearly gone. And CraigCoin consistently has [one pool with over 50% of the hashing power]( The hashwar was a personal battle between two narcissists fighting to seize control of their coin, with no regard to the users.

They are completely different things. Bitmessage is a decentralized and peer to peer system. This is a centralized service run by Blockstream. Bitmessage runs over the regular Internet, so you have to have an Internet connection to receive messages. Blockstream's service broadcasts from satellites, so all you need to get the messages is a receiver capable of picking up the signal. You can send messages over bitmessage for free. To send a message with this you have to pay Blockstream (all be it with testnet bitcoin that can be had for free).

There is a way to have your cake and eat it too. You can hold your own keys *and* have a third party protect your coins by using multi-signature wallets. You have a wallet that requires 2 out of 3 keys to sign. You have two, one goes in a safe and the other lives on your computer or hardware wallet for easy use. The third party holds the third key. Normally you use the spending key and the third party uses their key after you do two factor authentication with them. If the third party goes uncooperative for any reason, then you use the backup key to recover your funds.
You can also give backup keys to trusted friends or family members.

I think the Core devs would disagree with you on that.
If a 2x increase is okay and the only problem is switching to different devs, then Core should implement 2x. That way a split would be avoided and the people that want 2x would be able to stay with the better dev team.

When the next block arrives is based on luck. Whether or not your transaction is in that block depends on the fee you pay and how much competition there is for block space.

A hardfork is a change to the rules, allowing something that wasn't allowed before. If everyone accepts the new rules then there is no split. If anyone rejects the new rules, and has enough mining power to make their chain viable, then there is a split.
A softfork could also lead to a split if it is adopted by a mining minority. Had segwit not been activated when it was then UASF would have been a softfork split.

In late 2008 when Satoshi was writing the whitepaper and coding the first version of the Bitcoin software Musk had his hands full with the near bankruptcy of both SpaceX and Tesla, as well as a nasty divorce. As impressive as he is, I doubt even Elon would start another major project like inventing Bitcoin while pulling teeth trying to keep two companies from going under. If Satoshi had come out with Bitcoin at any other time it might be believable.

There's a vulnerability that PoS has that PoW doesn't. With PoW if you want to take over the network you have to actively out mine everyone else for as long as you want to stay in control. If you stop mining or if the rest of the miners launch enough mining power to take you on you lose control.
With PoS once you have a controlling share you are set. As long as you don't sell beyond that point you can sit on your ass and still retain control for the rest of time.

Strong replay protection means a chain can't accept transactions that were created, but not confirmed, before the split.
For BCH it meant that timelocked transactions couldn't be redeemed. For example, Greenaddress 2-of-2 wallets use timelocked transactions as a backup. Because timelocked transactions created before the split don't work on BCH, and Greenaddress doesn't support BCH, anyone who had coins in a Greenaddress 2-of-2 wallet has no way to get their BCH. If BCH had gone with opt-in replay protection, as they originally intended, people would have been able to use the timelocked backup transactions to get that BCH.
You know what else uses transactions that are intended to not be confirmed until later? The Lighting Network. If anyone has payment channels open when the split happens they could be stuck unable to publish the latest channel balance on a chain with strong replay protection.
Let's say, for a hypothetical example, that you and I open a payment channel. We each put in 1 BTC. We get the opening transaction confirmed on the blockchain with a 2-of-2 address that we both have to sign for. Over the course of the next month I make several payments by creating and signing transactions that we don't publish yet (because we want to keep using the channel).
The S2X split happens. Let's say S2X has strong replay protection. Let's also say that the S2X coin has some significant value. You want to claim the S2X coins corresponding to your share of the latest state of the channel so you can sell them, or whatever. If I am uncooperative at this point then you are up a creek without a paddle. You can't publish the latest version of the channel on the S2X fork, because of strong replay protection. The only way you can get at them is by creating a new transaction and getting me to sign it.
I could be like Greenaddress and refuse to interact with S2X at all, and your S2X coins would be lost. I could try to extort you, by saying I will only sign a transaction that gives me at least 50% of your share of the coins.

Store of value and medium of exchange (use as currency) are two different things. Gold, for example, is a good store of value but terrible for currency. Inflationary fiat money is a good medium of exchange but a bad store of value.
[Gresham's law]( says that "bad money drives out good" from circulation. Better stores of value will be held and worse stores of value will be spent.
Bitcoin isn't valuable because it can be used as a currency. It's valuable because it can be used as a hedge against fiat hyperinflation and because it acts as a stock for the tech of the Bitcoin platform.

It was the miners that activated it before UASF kicked in. They activated it when they did because of the threat of UASF.

If we can make small purchases feasible without centralizing nodes, it would help decentralization. If you have to use fiat for small purchases you have to go through the exchange process. Exchanges are a major centralization point. Paying for everything directly with Bitcoin closes the loop.

This gets to the heart of it. Miners follow the money. What matters most is which chain has the most economic support.


Putting myself in the shoes of Bitpay: Bitpay's business model is accepting Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. High transaction fees cut into their profits and make them less competitive against other payment processors like Paypal and Western Union. If transaction fees become high enough Bitpay becomes unviable and could go under. If I was a shareholder and or the CEO of Bitpay I would do everything in my power to reduce transaction fees.
If I met with a significant number of the other major Bitcoin businesses and they pledged to put their support behind S2X for similar reasons, I would be all in. Bitpay has a lot to lose if they don't support S2X, and a lot to gain if S2X succeeds.

That's largely irrelevant to how much power is used for mining because of the competitive nature of mining and the [red queen's race]( of difficulty adjustment. The amount of money spent on mining will tend towards the value of the mining reward. Make a mining chip that is more power efficient and miners will just use more of them.
That's already played out with asics. More power is used on mining now than than in the early days of cpu and gpu mining, despite asics being ridiculously more efficient. Massive mining farms didn't become a thing until asics did.

This is the the thing that is fundamentally different from the Bitcoin Cash fork. BCH is clearly the spin off and everyone knew it from the beginning. The supporters of both S2X and Core both believe that their coin is *the* Bitcoin and the other side is something else. Bitpay, especially, seems to take it for granted that S2X is Bitcoin; to the degree they casually put BTC1 in their instructions for installing a full node.
Exchanges are going to have to choose which, if either, they call Bitcoin and what they call something else, if only to avoid confusion in their order books.

It depends on if miners think that they can make more money in the long run by keeping the Core chain alive. Miners mined the BCH chain at a loss for a while before it became profitable.

It largely doesn't affect it either way. The run up in power happened because of the run up in the value of bitcoin driving up the value of the mining rewards.
The carbon foot print of mining will tend towards: (value of mining rewards)/(cost per kilowatt hour of energy)*(carbon emitted per kilowatt hour generated)
If you want to lower the carbon footprint of mining you have to change one of those three things:
* The value of the mining reward goes down, or
* The cost of energy goes up (incentivizing miners to use less of it), or
* Energy production becomes cleaner

Rational miners follow the money. The best predictor of where the hash power will go is the relative value of the mining reward on either chain. The best predictors of that, right now, are the various futures markets that exchanges are offering. Those are trading at S2X = 10% - 15% of BTC, and 1X is 85% to 90%.
Miners could try to play chicken with the market and mine S2X even if it is less profitable short term, but that is a big risk.

Full nodes validate blocks *for themselves*. A full node that isn't tied to either mining or economic activity doesn't matter to anyone but the person running it.
The network can run just fine on 10% of the nodes. But if it suddenly drops to 10% of the mining power it will take months to recover.

Coinbase said they will split all the coins they hold. Account holders don't need to worry about that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:41:44
The only nodes that miners need are their own and those connected to one or more exchanges with an exchange rate high enough to make mining worthwhile.
S2X can run just fine with only 10% of the nodes (provided they have enough economic support). Core BTC would struggle through months of slow blocks and/or be forced into a PoW change if they only get 10% of the mining power.
In the end miner pre-signalling doesn't matter, they follow the money. And raw node count doesn't matter that much either, only the economically important nodes. One Coinbase node that serves [over ten million users]( carries a lot more weight than thousands of nodes that only serve one person each.

Forking is a game of chicken. The side that gets the majority of the network effect gets a massive advantage. Implementing things like replay protection and new addresses and such is capitulating. It's in everyone's best interest if someone does it, but each side is better off if the other side does it instead.
With BCH and Ethereum Classic it was clear who the winner would be and the other side accepted their place.

If exchanges like Coinbase support S2X it will be easier to buy, driving demand and therefore price. If payment providers like Bitpay support it then it makes it easier to spend, giving people a reason to want it, driving demand and price.
Tl;dr The support of businesses like Coinbase and Bitpay will make S2X more valuable then it would be without them, which will attract more mining power and make the S2X chain more viable and able to survive.

A non mining node can enforce the rules by carrying out economic activity. By using a full node you ensure the coins you are accepting are following the rules you support and in turn you give value to that version of the coin.

If I was a major miner intending to mine S2X regardless of short term profit I would buy up as much BT2 futures tokens as I could for two reasons.
First is raw profit. BT2 is trading at 13% of the value of BTC. If the miners can force the market onto S2X I would be looking at up to a seven fold return.
The second is building confidence in S2X. The higher traders can push the BT2 price the more confidence in it there will be. The more exchanges, business and other miners will support it, making the first point more likely to pay off.
The fact that BT2 is holding at a steady 13% of BTC value suggests that miners aren't doing that, at least not enough to massively affect the price.

They are going to follow the chain with the most hashpower. Miners follow the money, so the chain with the most hashpower will be the one with the best price. According to the relative values of [Bitfinex's futures tokens]( 1X is about [3 times as valuable as 2X]( (compare BT1/BTC and BT2/BTC).

Minimum ping time for a signal to get to a server 45 miles away and back again is [0.48 ms]( assuming the connection goes in a straight line at the speed of light.
The nodes you connect to aren't all going to be in Seattle, though. So the ping time to them will be higher.
Unless you are mining, latency shouldn't really matter that much for running a full node. It doesn't matter if it takes a little extra time to get blocks as long as you get them.
If you are a miner then latency matters a lot. Miners want to get other miners' blocks as fast as possible so they can start mining on them. And they want to get their blocks out as fast as possible before someone else finds and propagates a competing block.

@_date: 2017-10-11 14:01:34


BTC earned from that many blocks:  
1,152 blocks * 14.1 BTC^[1] /Block = 16,200 BTC^[2]
Value of BTC earned at current price:  
16,200 BTC * 4,784 USD/BTC = 77,500,000 USD^[2]
Estimate of B2X earned:  
1,152 blocks * 12.5^[3] B2X/Block = 14,400 B2X^[2]
Estimated value of B2X earned:  
14,400 B2X * 1,032 USD^[4] /B2X = 14,900,000 USD^[2]
Estimated loss from mining B2X:  
77,500,000 USD - 14,900,000 USD = 62,600,000 USD
Conclusion: Assuming B2X keeps its current projected value, and mining costs are close to revenue, miners will have to take a loss of close to $62.6 million to get B2X to its first difficulty adjustment.

What do you think nodes do? It doesn't matter if 90% of nodes don't run S2X. S2X will ignore any nodes that don't run S2X. Core nodes are irrelevant to them. Just like Litecoin nodes are irrelevant to Bitcoin. If Litecoin had ten times as many nodes as Bitcoin it wouldn't mean Bitcoin is doomed. Even if 90% of Bitcoin nodes shut down to run Litecoin nodes it still wouldn't kill Bitcoin.
What matters is exchange. Miners need to be able to sell the coins they earn for a good enough price to make mining worth while. If the S2X chain has that it will be viable. If it doesn't it won't.

If you have Bitcoins in a hardware wallet at the time of the fork your hardware wallet will have both coins. Your ability to safely access both coins will depend on whether the software you use to access your hardware wallet supports both coins.
The biggest issue you have to watch out for is replay: Initially your coins on both chains look identical. If you spend one of the coins someone could replay the transaction on the other chain and your other coins will be sent as well.
Don't do anything with your coins after the fork until you split them to make them look different to the two chains. Google the name of your hardware wallet and something like "coin splitting" or "replay protection" to find out how to do it for your wallet.
Coinbase will take care of splitting for their customers who have bitcoin in their accounts *at the time of the fork*.

The job of the miners is to canonize the transaction record. Miners will always be needed for that job. New coins are part of the pay miners get for doing that. The other part is transaction fees. Right now new coins make up most of miners' pay. As the rate of new coins created goes down over time transaction fees will make up a larger and larger percent of miners' revenue. When there are no more new coins to mint miners will be paid entirely with transaction fees.

The point of the testnet is to allow developers to test new things without risking real value. In order for that to happen testnet coins have to be valueless. Anyone who buys or sells them gives them a value and makes them unsuitable for testing.
The etiquette is to pick up some free testnet coins either through mining or from a faucet, use them for whatever testing you need to do, them send them back to a faucet so other testers can easily do the same.
Resetting testnet from time to time does punish anyone who was stupid enough to buy testnet coins, but more importantly it keeps the testnet a valueless sandbox where developers can safely do testing.

Bcash is still alive and running. Calling it an altcoin doesn't negate the fact that it is a functioning currency, albeit with a much lower value and amount of use than Bitcoin currently has. Bcash has a higher market value than Bitcoin had during most of the time of Coinbase and Bitpay have been in business. Even if S2X got no more support than Bcash, it would hurt them, but they could weather it.
But S2X has more support than Bcash did. There is a long list of major Bitcoin businesses that signed support for it. Bcash didn't have that. If all the businesses that signed support for S2X had supported Bcash right out of the gate and dropped support for Core Bitcoin, Bcash would be worth a lot more than it is now.

This calls for some good old backwards induction:
* A rational miner will mine on top of a content block that includes a minimum threshold in fees, or one that he is paid out of band to mine on.
* A rational content block creator (CBC) will include just enough payment to the next miner to ensure that the next miner will mine on the content block, provided that the CBC is earning enough to pay it. If she isn't, then she won't bother creating the content block.
* A rational user wants to see their transaction confirm quickly for a low fee. For arguments sake I'll only consider users that are willing to pay the going fee rate. The trade off between confirmation time and fee will vary from user to user.
* A rational user will pay the minimum amounts necessary to get their transaction into a content block that gets confirmed. That means they will pay the CBC just enough to get the transaction into a content block, and that they will either pay the next miner just enough to get the content block confirmed, or pay the CBC enough extra that the CBC is able to bribe the next miner to mine on top of the content block.

It depends on the data size of the transaction and how much congestion there happens to be at the moment. What miners look at is satoshis per byte. If you look up your transaction on [tradeblock]( it will tell you the satoshis/byte.
To get an idea of the range of fees, here are two transactions from a recent block, one with [2.37 satoshis/byte]( and one with [198. satoshis/byte](
(Transactions can also get into a block without a fee based on the age (in confirmations) and size (in satoshis) of the inputs. [This]( explains more about that.)

Yes, the conversion rate is important. That doesn't mean bitcoin is pegged to a fiat currency.
Currencies that are pegged have a fixed exchange rate. 1 unit of currency A is always worth x units of currency B. They gain and lose value together keeping the exchange rate between them constant.
The exchange rate between bitcoin and fiat currencies floats. The value of fiat currency and the value of bitcoin move independently. Fiat can lose value (inflationary) while bitcoin gains value (deflationary), and vice versa. That's why the exchange rate between bitcoin and fiat can move all over the place.

Bill Gates mentions vaccines in a list of things that will reduce population growth. The leaps needed to go from "vaccines reduce population growth" to "Gates is having the vaccines tainted with toxins and sterilants" are implicit assumptions that vaccines have to have toxins and sterilents to reduce population growth and that Bill Gates is cold hearted enough to use that tactic.
The idea that vaccines have to have toxins and sterilents to reduce population growth isn't true. Vaccines make quality of life better by preventing disease and saving lives.

Ideally ballot secrecy includes the voters themselves not being able to provably reveal their vote to a third party. If they can then someone could threaten or bribe them to vote a certain way and prove it. If they can't then threats and bribes don't carry weight because the voter can lie about how they voted.
With public key based voting a voter can sign a message with the key they use to vote proving how they voted. Further an attacker could coerce a voter to give up their private key, giving the attacker direct control over the vote.
Ballot secrecy isn't that hard for a voter to defeat in a physical voting system either, though. All they have to do is take a camera into the booth to record the vote.

In the middle of a difficulty cycle the only thing that matters for profitability in the moment is the the difficulty level, not the hash rate. If the difficulty is too high and the reward too low then it can be unprofitable to mine, *even if no else is mining at the moment*.

It will take me some time to go through the [original]( [sources]( that your links quote to see what they actually say and if they support claim about intentional vaccine tainting.
My thoughts at first glace:
* The title of the Rockefeller report quoted is "PRESIDENT'S FIVE-YEAR REVIEW ANNUAL REPORT 1968". That is way out of date. The Rockefeller Foundation's positions could have completely changed since then. There have been a lot of terrible things that have been done by various groups in the past that have since been stopped or corrected. The are also plenty of issues to spend energy on that are relevant right now without fighting half-century old documents.
* "In the course of August and September 2010, I wrote several articles for Infowars..." Infowars is known for unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. That alone doesn't rule out the truth of what's being claimed, but it isn't a vote of confidence either.
* Nothing I saw in my first glance (including a search for "vaccine") through the original sources said anything about vaccine tainting.
* The Rockefeller Foundation is not the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If the Rockefeller Foundation is tainting vaccines that would be significant but it wouldn't mean that Gates is in on it.
My beliefs coming into this (may or may not be correct, take with a grain of salt):
* Vaccines save lives. Unsubstantiated claims about vaccines being tainted erodes confidence in vaccines, causing fewer people to get vaccinated, causing more people to die of disease. This is a serious issue that needs careful consideration.
* The Earth cannot support an infinite human population. At some point we will will reach maximum capacity. Population growth will have to be addressed at some point before we reach that point. I don't know what that point is or how close we are to it.
* Reducing population growth in under developed regions will help the economy of those regions. Regions that have a growing population don't do as well economically as regions with a stable population. That is because population growth means more babies being born, more old people staying alive longer, or both. That means a higher ratio of people that need looked after to the number of working age adults who are able to provide.
* Untainted vaccines that are what they say on the box indirectly reduce the birth rate. Parents faced with high infant/child mortality have more children to compensate. Vaccines reduce the infant/child mortality, giving parents more confidence that their progeny will grow into healthy, grandchild producing adults. This is a significant factor in why developed countries have a lower birthrate than under developed countries. Tainting isn't needed for vaccines to reduce birth rates.
* Bill Gates is a hero. He, along with Steve Jobs and the teams of people working for them, helped change the world by getting easy to use personal computers into households all over the developed world. Now he is using 99.9% of the reward to change the world again by helping the developing world catch up.
tl;dr - I'm skeptical of the claim that vaccines are intentionally tainted. I will be back to the discussion when I have reviewed the sources.

The BIP 148 chain can exist with less hashing power than the legacy chain. (It's like Ethereum Classic in that way, which survives with only 7% of the hashing power of the hardforked Ethereum.) It has stricter rules so it will never reorganize to accept legacy blocks after the split.
The legacy chain will alway be vulnerable to being reorganized onto the BIP 148 chain if it falls behind in hashpower, unless it softforks to disallow BIP 148 blocks.
There are two dangers with BIP 148 not getting enough hash power. The first is that it could take a long time to mine enough blocks to get to the next difficulty change. If it takes too long, then it will miss the Segwit activation deadline. If that happens then BIP 149 will be used as the backup plan.
The other danger of having low hashpower is that the chain is easy to attack. Miners who oppose Segwit could devote some of their hashpower to mining empty blocks on the BIP 148 chain, making it useless.

This is a big deal for altcoins. It isn't as big of a deal for bitcoin. It gives altcoins more access to the much larger value pool that is bitcoin, while bitcoin gets access to the smaller value pool of altcoins.
This can be used to trade fiat proxies, like nubits and bitshares, but if someone needs real fiat out, for example to pay bills, then this isn't much help.
Consider these two paths from bitcoin to real fiat:
1. Bob uses a trusted third party (an exchange or bank), a bitcoin ATM, or local bitcoins to trade bitcoin for fiat.
1. Bob uses mercury to trade bitcoin for bitshares or nubits.
2. Bob uses a trusted third party or meets someone in person to trade bitshares or nubits for fiat.
The second path adds an extra step. Step 2 in the second path is the same as step one in the first path, except that there is far more friction and far less liquidity in the bitshares and nubits to real fiat markets than there is in the bitcoin to fiat market.

If you look at the timestamps for [that block]( and the [previous block]( that block was found seconds after the previous one.
When miners receive a block it takes a little bit of time to download and verify all of the transactions in it. If a miner stops mining during that time they lose some of their chance to find the next block, so they keep mining. But since they don't yet know all of the transactions in the last block, any transaction they include (except the first one which gives them their reward) could already be in the last block. Including a duplicate transaction like that would make their block invalid, and they can't run that risk. So they mine a (nearly) empty block until they finish verifying the last one.

@_date: 2017-07-17 14:58:12
Short answer: Yes.
Long answer:
At least 80% of blocks have to signal BIP-91 (bit 4) for BIP-91 to start enforcing segwit (bit 1) signalling.
If all the pools that are signalling bit 1 didn't signal bit 4, then BIP-91 would get at most 55% and wouldn't activate. The rest of the miners wouldn't signal bit 1. Segwit would stay at 45% signalling.
If they do throw their weight behind bit 4, then bit 4 could get to 80%. Bit 1 signalling would become mandatory. 100% of blocks would signal bit 1. Segwit would activate shortly thereafter.

2. You will be just fine with Core for at least the next three months. In three months you may or may not want to switch to something else. See 3
3. Yes and no. BIP-91 automatically leads to a hardfork for anyone running BTC1. Core probably won't follow the 2x hardfork. There will probably be a chain split with Core on one side and BTC1 on the other. NYA has a lot of [pledged support]( The 2x chain will probably have most of the mining power and economic support. If you want to stay on the biggest chain you may have to switch to something other than Core at that point. If sticking with Core and the principles it represents is more important to you, then you can keep using Core.

Once BIP-91 locks in there will be a grace period of another 336 blocks before it activates and bit 1 signalling becomes mandatory. Just because they aren't signalling bit 1 yet doesn't mean they aren't running BIP-91, and it doesn't mean they will immediately start orphaning blocks.

It's a little convoluted.
Right now miners are signalling bit 4, which shows support for BIP-91. When BIP-91 locks in there will be another 336 blocks for miners to get ready for BIP-91 activation. At that point signalling bit 1 to support segwit will be mandatory.
Because of the way the BIP-141 (segwit) activation windows fall, it will take another 2689 blocks for BIP141 to lock in. Then there is *another* grace period of 2016 blocks before segwit actually activates.
All told, segwit will activate 5073 blocks from now. That's just over a month.

That's a dicey assumption. If they could rely on that then they wouldn't need wipeout protection. Miners are notoriously finicky.

"Atomic swap" means the whole BTC/LTC exchange transaction happens as one inseparable event. Bob sends Alice Bitcoin at the same time as Alice sends Bob Litecoin, in such a way that if either backs out of their half of the transaction the whole thing falls through. It's a way to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without either party trusting each other.
One way to do atomic swaps is with the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network chains transactions together so that if any of them happen all of them happen. The transactions don't have to be on the same blockchain or be the same currency.

If they wanted to back out of segwit it would have been a whole lot easier and a whole lot less messy to back out 269 blocks ago. The facts that they locked in BIP-91, that over 90% of miners are signalling it (despite only needing 80%), that it was locked in during one of the first periods possible, and that it all happened a day before it was scheduled to even begin are all strong indicators that they actually intend to go through with it. Why in the world would they do all that if they didn't mean it?
To back out now would just be betarded.

If less than 50% of miners follow and enforce BIP-91 then there would be a chain split. This is unlikely to happen. If they didn't support BIP-91 then they wouldn't have signalled for it, and nobody wants an unexpected chain split like that.
If less than 50% but more than 0 miners don't follow and enforce BIP-91 then their blocks will be orphaned and they will lose a lot of money.
If all miners follow and enforce BIP-91 then there will be no chain split and no orphans (other than the normal orphans from blocks being found at the same time). The softfork will go smoothly.
The miners have major incentive to follow BIP-91 by signalling bit 1 after activation.

Bitcoin is a social construct. It exists because we agree it exists. A majority of the Bitcoin economy can force a change in the properties of Bitcoin that the minority would have to accept, whether they like it or not. The Bitcoin economy could at some point in the future migrate to another blockchain, forgetting old coins that didn't make it over.
Gold is a physical thing. Its value is still largely a social construct, but its existence and properties are unchanging and independent of social politics. Hide a piece of gold sufficiently well and it can stay the same for millennia, regardless of what the rest of the world does.
On the other hand, paper gold, which is what the great majority of people who think they own gold actually have, is just as much a social construct as Bitcoin.

They switched to strong replay protection. The SIGHASH_FORKID flag they are using to mark BCC transactions is now mandatory. No valid BTC transaction is a valid BCC transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:13:43




txids are based on:
* The txids of all the inputs being spent
* Amounts being spent
* Signatures
* Output amounts and scripts (including OP_RETURN values)
* Extra stuff like sighash and such
You can create different txids by having any of those things be different.
If any of the input txids are different, then the txid will be different. That means that you can split coins by mixing them with already split coins.
If you only use txid inputs that exist, are valid and are unspent on both chains then you get a new transaction with the same txid onto both chains. As long as you never mix the coins with split coins, and the transactions get confirmed on both chains, then you could keep making replayable transactions forever.
BCC replay protection works by introducing a special OP_RETURN value "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" that is invalid on BCC. If you include it in a transaction then the transaction will be a valid BTC transaction that can't be copied to BCC.
To go the other way, they have a special hash type flag that is invalid under current rules that is valid for BCC. If you set that flag you get a BCC only transaction.

For the same reason that it's a good idea to have separation of powers between the legislature and executive branches of government. There's a difference between deciding on the rules and carrying them out. In Bitcoin there is also a difference between deciding on the rules and deciding on the transaction history.
In full PoS the majority stakeholders can rewrite history unilaterally, without losing any money directly. No one has to download a new client for a PoS chain to be reorged.
On the other hand changing the rules, whether it's UTXO activated, user activated or miner activated, still requires all miners (in the case of a softfork) or everyone (in the case of a hardfork) to be on board.
tl;dr Power to signal for rule changes is not as dangerous as power to rewrite history, because rules can't change without nodes running new code regardless of who is signalling.

OpenBazaar is a decentralized network of users connecting directly to each other. There is no central operator who can run off or be shut down. OpenBazzar has an escrow system but it has a few key differences from the traditional escrow used by Evolution. First of all there is a market of many notaries and arbiters instead of just one. More importantly, though, it uses multisig. Any two out of the three parties involved (buyer, seller and notary) are required to release the funds from escrow. When things well the buyer and seller both agree on how to release the funds. When there is a dispute the notary can step in and side with either the buyer or seller. But, unlike in traditional escrow, the notary can't run off with the funds because they can't release them on their own.

By saying that the selfish miner finds the next block, it implies that the honest miner hasn't found any blocks in that time.

Other miners are far more important for keeping miners honest than full nodes are. In order for a miner to get their reward their block has to get into the longest chain. That means they need the rest of the miners to mine on top of it. An invalid block would immediately be orphaned wasting the miners work. In order for an invalid block to get into and stay in the blockchain over 50% of miners would have not only have to collude, but keep colluding to keep it there.
Even if an invalid block ever got into the blockchain I guarantee everyone would hear about. All it takes is one honest full node to blow the whistle.

Votes would have to be based on unspent transaction outputs. Only the last transaction that moved a coin would count towards the vote. That way you have to hold coins to vote, ping-ponging coins won't give you more votes, and if you send coins to someone else you also give up that vote.


Votes have to be weighted by how much Bitcoin is held. 1,000,000 1 satoshi transactions have the same voting power as 1 1,000,000 satoshi transaction. Your voting power doesn't change based on how you divide your coins.


That's a legitimate issue to consider. As long as there are any miners willing to include those transactions, and the mining majority doesn't reject their blocks outright, then votes can get through.
51% of miners could essentially "softfork" to declare transactions that make certain votes aren't valid. (Incidentially, this is exactly what BIP 91 and BIP 148 do for blocks that vote against segwit.) That kind of censorship would be very obvious, though, and have major political fallout.
One way to make votes uncensorable is through hash commitments. Instead of putting your vote in the transaction directly, you put in a salted hash of your vote. That way miners don't know how you are voting until after your vote is committed to a block. Only then do you reveal your vote.

Hardforks are harder to roll out safely. WIth a hardfork every node has to upgrade or get split off. With a softfork only miners have to upgrade, and everyone else will follow along.
The bigger issue, though, is increased block size. The bigger the block size the more data nodes have to download, verify and store. Bigger blocks means it's more expensive to run a node, which means fewer nodes. And fewer nodes means more centralization.

It's one of those "rule 2 is follow rule 1" situations. If BIP-91 is activated then every block will have to signal for BIP-141.


BIP-91 has the same rule as BIP-148 UASF: All blocks must signal support for BIP-141. The difference is how and when that rule goes into effect. For the UASF the rule kicks in on Aug 1st. For BIP-91 the rule kicks in once 80% of blocks signal support for BIP-91.
If BIP-91 is activated before August 1st then it will be completely compatible with BIP-148 and everything will be kumbaya until November when the hardfork happens.

Bcash's market cap can't really be determined in a meaningful way yet.
Market cap is only meaningful if you assume all of the coins can be easily put on the market. Under that assumption all of the coins must be considered by their owner to be worth at least the market price, or they would sell them.
Bcash only has one small futures market. In order to sell Bcash on it you have to lock up BTC and trust that the exchange will honor it on August 1st. A lot of people don't trust viabtc. Considering the news about BTC-E and Mt. Gox it's not smart to lock up coins on any exchange. U.S. customers are completely excluded.
There are plenty of people who will be more than willing to sell their Bcash after the August 1st split, who for one reason or another aren't selling on viabtc.

That's not how it works. Each side will have their own mempool and every transaction at the time of the split can be used independently on each side of the chain. The non-forking miners can include whatever they want in their chain and it won't effect the hardforked chain.

After the UAHF split there will be two versions of Bitcoin: the non-hardforked Bitcoin and the hardforked Bitcoin Cash. If you own Bitcoin now you will have both after the split.
BTC_FROZEN2 and BCC are futures for those two versions. Right now they only exist on the order books of ViaBTC. You can trade them, but you can't withdraw them before the split.
When the split happens the Bitcoin that ViaBTC holds will become non-hardforked Bitcoin and BCC. Anyone who has BTC_FROZEN2 in their ViaBTC account at that time will be able to redeem it for non-hardforked BTC. Anyone who has BCC will be able to withdraw it on the hardforked chain.

The best way to do escrow with Bitcoin is with a 2 of 3 [multisig address](
The buyer, the seller and a third party arbitrator each have a key. The three keys are used to create a multi-signature address that requires any combination of two out of the three keys. The buyer sends bitcoin (in this case the 0.1 BTC) to the multisig address. The seller delivers the goods (the gas).
If everything goes well the seller and the buyer agree on what should be done with the escrowed bitcoin (0.05 to the seller, 0.05 back to the buyer). They create a transaction sending from the multisig address and both sign it. If they both agree then the arbitrator isn't needed and doesn't have to sign the transaction.
If something goes wrong and the buyer and seller disagree, or if one of them disappears, then the arbitrator has to step in. The arbitrator looks at the case and decides who to side with. The arbitrator and the one they side with come to together to create a transaction that sends the money to that person.
The arbitrator can resolve a dispute, but they can't run off with the money, since they only have one key.
As for splitting the money between the buyer and seller, that is absolutely possible. Bitcoin transactions can send portions to multiple addresses. Here is an [example](
[Copay]( is an easy to use multisig wallet that you can play around with to get the hang of it.

ECDSA signatures use a value called k that has to be chosen randomly for each signature. If the same k is used to sign multiple messages then the private key can be found from the signatures. If you use a weak RNG to create k values and reuse addresses then your private key can be cracked. That happened to the wallets on [Android](
There are three solutions:
1. Use [deterministic k values]( based on the hash of the private key and message
2. Use a cryptographically strong RNG
3. Don't reuse addresses

You are confusing replay protection with wipeout protection.
The replay problem is when you make a transaction on one chain and it gets copied, "replayed", to the other chain. You send BTC-hardfork coins and suddenly your BTC-legacy coins are sent too. It affects individual transactions.
The wipeout problem is when the whole chain reorgs onto the other chain. It's like the whole hardforked side ceases to exist.
The hardfork bit protects against wipeout. It doesn't do anything about replay.

Yes we can. And what the blockchain tells us is miners supported BIP-91 in a landslide. They were practically falling over each other to lock it in as fast as they could.

There are three possible chain splits with different chances of happening:
**UASF BIP-148** triggers on August 1st. It requires that all blocks signal support for segwit. BIP-91, if activated, does the same thing. If BIP-91 doesn't activate before Aug 1st BIP-148 could cause a chain split. Because BIP-91 activation is looking very likely at this point, a BIP-148 based chain split is unlikely.
**Bitcoin ABC** is Bitmain's response to BIP-148. It's a hardfork that triggers twelve hours after BIP-148 does. Bitmain said they would only use it if BIP-148 splits the chain. No BIP-148 chain split means no Bitcoin ABC chain split.
**Segwit2x** is BIP-91 plus a 2x block size increase three months later. BIP-91 activating means a higher chance of a segwit2x hardfork, but that doesn't happen for another three months.

This is similar to Ethereum's hardfork. The majority wanted it. A small, but significant, minority were dead set against it as a matter of principle. ETC is still alive and well, despite being much smaller than ETH. ETC is 8% the size of ETH, by market cap, but it's still represents $1.4 billion. ETC is the fifth largest cryptocurrency (fourth if you don't count Ripple).
We have a similar situation here. The majority of miners are signalling that they will hardfork a larger blocksize. Part of the community is flat out against it as a matter of principle, including some Core devs. They would rather stick with a smaller chain that does what they want, than a large chain that doesn't. They are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure their chain survives, including changing the PoW if need be.

7. Conclusion (from 5 and 6): If mining is sufficiently decentralized, the security of the blockchain is proportional to total miner revenue.

BIP-91 prevents an August 1st chain split, but there will probably be a chain split in November with the 2x part of segwit2x.
UASF/BIP-148 would have split the chain if blocks weren't all voting for segwit by August 1st. That has just been averted by BIP-91. By locking in it guarantees that all blocks will be voting for segwit well before August 1st. That's a big part of why BIP-91 was pushed through so fast.
The majority of miners only agreed to BIP-91 on the condition that they also get the 2x hardfork three months after the activation of segwit. 90% of miners are indicating that they intend to go through with the hardfork. There is nothing the miners can do to force anyone to accept the hardfork who doesn't want to. Those who don't accept it will end up on a separate chain from those who do.

It's something that you buy now that lets you claim something later. Essentially a preorder.




A hardfork is any change to the protocol that breaks the existing rules. Bitcoin Cash will be a hardfork because it allows blocks that are bigger than 1 MB, which the current rules of Bitcoin don't allow.
It will cause a split in the blockchain. People who run Bitcoin ABC (the software that operates Bitcoin Cash) will create and accept blocks that will be rejected by everyone else. Those that continue to run the current version of Bitcoin will create and accept blocks that follow the current rules.
The blockchain that continues to follow to current rules after the split, and the currency that is recorded on that blockchain, is what I mean by "non-hardforked-Bitcoin". It's the version of Bitcoin that doesn't change the rules by hardforking.

Your node is still validating the rules it has. It won't accept any blocks that aren't valid by the existing rules.
It doesn't know about BIP-91 (segwit2x), so it can't validate that BIP-91's rules are being followed. If someone created a block that follows the old rules but violates BIP-91, your node would accept it.
What does BIP-91 do? If activated it makes it mandatory to signal support for BIP-141 (segwit). BIP-141 is something that your node understands and knows how to validate (if you are on the latest version of Core).
Before BIP-91 activates: Your rules are the same as everybody else's.
After BIP-91 activates, but before BIP-141 does: There is an extra rule that the miners are following that your node doesn't check.
After BIP-141 activates: You are back to using identical rules as the miners and everyone else.

If you keep your coins on Coinbase you run the risk that:
* Coinbase goes bankrupt and takes your coins with it
* Coinbase gets hacked (possibly by someone on the inside) and loses your coins
* Coinbase runs a fractional reserve making people think they own more bitcoin than there actually is, devaluing bitcoin, and your coins with it
* Coinbase or the government decides they don't like you or something you did for some reason and freezes you coins
Coinbase has been stable and running well for years, so the odds of them suddenly disappearing is lower than it is for most exchanges. But there have been *a lot* of exchanges and custodial wallets that have gone belly up and taken a lot of their customers' money with them. Just because they have been around a while doesn't mean they are immune.
The biggest risk with Coinbase is that last one. Coinbase is quick to cooperate with US government regulations that restrict and control what people can do with their money. They have locked the accounts of a number of people whose coins they tracked to gambling or other activity the government doesn't approve of.
If you keep your coins in a wallet running on an internet connected computer you run the risk of being hacked, especially if you use that computer for other things.
Keeping your coins in a reputable hardware wallet, with your recovery phrase stored in a safe place, is one of the most secure ways to store your coins.

Payment channels where you transact with only one other party have been around for a long time. They aren't very interesting for the exact reasons you gave. But LN is something more than that.
The power of LN is chaining payments across multiple hops so you don't have to have a channel with everyone you transact with. As long as you have a channel with someone who has a channel with someone... ...who has a channel with the person you are paying, you can pay them.
It's like the way a checking account works. You go into bank A once to open an account. Your boss gives you your paycheck every two weeks. When you cash it it starts a series of payments. The company's account at the bank B -&gt; Bank B's account at the clearing house -&gt; Bank A's account at the clearing house -&gt; Your account at bank B.
You go to the store and buy something with your debit card. The same thing happens again. Your account at Bank A -&gt; Bank A's account at the clearing house -&gt; Bank C's account at the clearing house -&gt; The store's account at Bank C.
If you had to apply for a card at every store you make any purchases at, then one off purchases would be impractical. But you don't, because one card gets you access to a whole network.
LN is the same way: Open one or a few channels and get access to the whole network.

Psuedo-random just means if you put the exact same data into the hash function you'll get the same thing out. Without actually doing the hash what you would get out is as unpredictable as pure randomness. (At least until someone breaks the hash function, which is mathematically *extremely* difficult.)
The unpredictability is essential to proof of work and other security applications that hashes are used for. If there was a way to predict what a hash would be without actually calculating the hash miners could short circuit it and find blocks without doing the work.
I suggest studying up a bit on hashing and how it work. Here's a couple videos on the subject:

As said it forward requests for random blocks on to other nodes. Perhaps this could be fixed with a more rigorous challenge:
1. Challenger generates a random nonce and sends it to node.
2. Challenger and node combine nonce, node IP and challenger IP and hash.
3. Challenger and node use hash from 2 as a deterministic seed to psuedo randomly chose 128 blocks and choose 1 byte from each.
4. Challenger and node concatenate the bytes from 3 and hash.
5. Node sends hash to challenger.
6. Challenger verifies that hashes match. Challenger verifies that response came back fast enough.
The large number of blocks polled means that it would take a fake node time to download them. A real node already has them, so can get the information faster.
Including the IP addresses of the challenger and the node in the hash ensures that the node can't cheat by issuing the exact same challenge to another node.
This would require nodes to run special code to deal with challenges.

There's history behind that. r BTC started as a Bitcoin sub well before anyone had any thoughts of any plans to fork BCH off. Originally that camp wanted to change BTC itself to have larger blocks.
In 2015 Mike Hearn added BIP-101 support to his BitcoinXT client. BIP-101 would increase the blocksize if 75% of miners voted for it. The mods here didn't allow anyone to promote it under the rule "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted." (see the sidebar) Many of the big block supporters migrated to r BTC because of that censorship.
It wasn't until two years later when the fight over segwit came to a head that Bitmain introduced Bitcoin-ABC which became BCH. By that time the big block supporters had been using r BTC so long that they didn't want to give it up.

That's more or less right.
The change is just another output. So it's more like "I want to send 1 BTC to X and 0.18847576 to T." There's nothing saying which is the payment and which is the change. Without other clues an outside observer doesn't know if it's a 1 BTC payment with 0.18847576 BTC in change or a 0.18847576 BTC payment with 1 BTC in change.
The fee isn't explicitly included in the message. It's calculated by subtracting the outputs (including change output) from the inputs. There've been a few people who [accidently paid huge fees]( because they manually created transactions and forgot to include the change address.

It's less like a car race with linear progression toward a block and more like a treasure hunt where no one knows where to look so they search at random until someone stumbles on one of the possible solutions.

The question the "shill" answered is "how much hashing power?", not "how many nodes?"
USAF does need miner support, albeit a much lower level of support than any previous fork. Like it or not, miners create blockchains, not users. If BIP-148 doesn't one way or another get at least 15% miner support, segwit won't be activated in time. You will be left with a fork that has block times of at least an hour for at least three months, less security, and _the exact same rules and features as Bitcoin has now_. (If it only gets the 0.3% support from Slush, it will be much, much worse.)

Hashing is unpredictable. Every hash produces an independent psuedo-random result. Miners don't know what combination of block data will result in a winning hash until they try it. That's why blocks come at random intervals.
The nonces they try aren't random, true. They do progress linearly through the nonces, but that's only because incrementing is the easiest way to keep track of what they have tried and not duplicate work. They could go through the nonces in any order and have the same odds of finding a winning block in a given number of hashes. 
The hashes themselves are pseudo-random and unpredictable. That's where the randomness of mining comes from.

The way to get around that is to add a prediction market on the likelihood of BU happening, independent of the value of the coin. So you have a position that's worth $1 if BU happens, and a position that's worth $1 if it doesn't.
Then you can take the value of the BU future divided by the value of the $1 if BU happens position to get the value that BU would have if it happened.

30% of miners: "We want it."

BIP-148 supporting users: "We want it, even if the miners don't. When August 1st comes all miners will have to vote for it. We will shun miners that don't."

You need at least 15% of mining power to activate segwit. If you don't have that you won't be able to mine enough blocks to get it activated before it expires.
As it is, the mining power supporting BIP-148 now (~5% of Slush's ~5%, or ~0.25% overall) will take about _five days_ to mine each block, on average. A chain that slow will lose economic support very fast.
You can be in denial about the importance of mining all you want, but if you don't get enough mining power you are headed for a rude awaking come August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:04:59
Segwit won't activate immediately. BIP-148 doesn't directly activate segwit. It just forces miners to signal support for it. Enough signalling blocks (1,916 out of a 2,016 block period) actually activates segwit. Those 1,916-2,016 blocks will be 1 MB non-segwit blocks.

There are, of course, some caveats to that math. It uses a couple assumptions that aren't true and at least one that we don't know:
Assumption 1: Mining efficiency stays the same. Over the years mining efficiency will improve and make it easier to mine. Eventually (well before three decades from now) mining efficiency should come down enough to make reaching the retarget trivial. For example, if the hashrate now committed to this fork was trying to fork the chain of half a decade ago, they would retarget in about six hours.
Assumption 2: The value of the forked coin stays at about the same value as Bitcion at the time of the fork. Since the difficulty stays the same, if the value goes down mining loses all profitability. The only miners left would be anyone who is willing to through away money to keep a worthless chain alive.
Assumption 3: BIP148 won't get more miner support before Aug 1. More mining power could commit to it between now and then.
Assumption 4: There is no hardfork to reset the difficulty.
Assumption 5: My math is correct.
2 would kill the fork long before 1 comes into effect, unless 3 or 4 do.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:55:37
The only pool showing support for BIP-148 is Slush. [6% of Slush miners are voting for BIP-148]( Slush has [4.4% of the total hashpower]( 6% of 4.4% = 0.26% of total hashpower.

If you want to enforce BIP-148 _and avoid a split_, you need 51%. If you don't mind creating a split you need 15%. You have about 0.3%. You need 50 times as much hashpower supporting it to materialize in less than two months.

Miners (mostly*) don't compete with each other in the here and now. They compete with each other through future difficulty changes. If you have a certain amount of mining power, and a fixed difficulty, then your chance of finding a block in a given amount of time is the same whether there are one million other miners, or none. (It's also the same whether the last block was found one minute ago or an hour ago.)
If there are fewer miners _now_, then mining isn't easier now. It's easier in the future after the difficulty changes.
(*Exception: orphan risk.)

Jihan doesn't have all the hash power. If the top two pools besides AntPool both supported BIP-148 that would be enough to to get segwit activated. The top thirteen pools could refuse to support BIP-148 if the rest of the hash power all supported it and it would be enough.
15% is all that's needed. That's the lowest bar for a softfork in the history of softforks, maybe ever. If BIP-148 can't get even that much, then I pity it.

Bitmain said they won't hardfork if BIP-148 is too weak to survive.
Based on that things could look like this:
1. "BIP148 happens, but small mining power follows and there's obviously no immediate reorg risk"
2. Bitmain doesn't hardfork because BIP-148 isn't a threat.
3. The legacy chain continues until the next thing comes along (segwit2x, BIP-149, whatever).

Sure, but if you don't have enough mining power to create blocks, your nodes will have next to no blocks, valid or not.
Are you familiar with mining difficulty? It's how the blockchain adjusts to changes in mining power. The difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. In between those retargets the mining difficulty stays the same, even if there is a sudden change is hashpower. If your node suddenly rejects blocks from all but a tiny amount of the miners, the blocks will still be as difficult to mine for the rest of the 2016 block difficulty period. With a small amount of mining power blocks will take a long time to find, and getting through 2016 of them could take a _very_ long time.
BIP-148 needs at least 15% of the mining power to activate segwit. If it has less than that, then it won't be able to activate segwit before it expires in November.
Right now, BIP-148 has about 0.3% of the hashpower supporting it. That much hashpower would take about five days to mine each block. If it stayed at that amount it would take _three decades_ to get to a difficulty retarget.
Do you think that a blockchain that has five day block times for the next three decades, and doesn't even end up with segwit, would last very long?

1. You create and sign a transaction spending bitcoins. The transaction includes the ECDSA public key of the address you sent from.
2. You submit that transaction to the network.
3. The attacker gets your transaction and starts to work cracking the ECDSA key.
4. Some other miner includes your transaction in a block.
5. The attacker finally cracks your ECDSA key.
6. The attacker uses the key to create and sign a transaction double spending the coins you sent and sending them to their address instead. As long as your original transaction is in the blockchain their transaction is invalid as a double spend.
7. They use 51% of the mining power to replace the block that includes your transaction (and those that follow it).
8. They are now free to put their transaction in the blockchain instead, and steal the coins.
Of course this attack would take an extremely powerful attacker since they would not only have to be able to break your ECDSA key, but they would have to do a 51% attack for long enough to catch up from how ever long it took them to break the key. It also relies on the rest of the network not reacting to a massive chain reorg by forking to revert it.

They work on an empty block until they have a block with transactions ready. If they find a winning hash for an empty block, they don't get any transaction fees on that block. That only happens when they find a block unusually quickly, though, which means they can move on to mining the next block that much faster.
[These]( [three]( [blocks]( are a good example of that. Antpool found block 471285 (empty) thirteen seconds after block 471284. Six minutes later they found block 471286

You need to brush up on how mining actually works. (The [Bitcoin Whitepaper]( is a good place to start.) Between difficulty adjustments percentage of blocks doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is how you many blocks you find. Mining reward is 12.5 BTC per block plus transaction fees regardless of who else is finding blocks.
If you play the slots, the amount you walk away with isn't affected by how much the person sitting next to you is winning. But if the person next to you wins a lot one day, the casino may adjust how loose all the machines are that night, and you won't win as much the next day.
Bitcoin mining is exactly the same. Every hash is like a pull of the lever. Every pull of the lever is independent of who else is pulling the lever on their own machine, and independent of your earlier pulls. The difficulty adjustment is like the casino adjusting how loose the slots are after every 2,016 winning pulls.

Multisig services like Greenaddress or Bitgo give extra protection by requiring a password and 2 factor authentication. If you have your coins in a single key address you can get hacked.

Multisig can also be used to divide keys across multiple devices you own.

This was bound to happen eventually. Bitcoin is aiming to become competition to the banking system, after all.

The design of both the site and the tip cards look very good. It looks easy to use. Kudos on those. My question, though, is why should we trust you with our bitcoin? A brand new reddit account, a new bitcointalk account, a tormail address, and a minimum deposit of $9 don't exactly inspire confidence.

It can be done with a soft fork. The miners create "extra" blocks, with a new rule that the one-every-ten-minute blocks have to include all of the transactions that appeared in the preceding extra blocks.

The biggest attack right now is on the exchanges. The less reliant the Bitcoin economy is on the exchanges the stronger it will be. The more goods and services bought and sold for Bitcoin without exchanging into state currencies the more chance there will be of Bitcoin surviving.

The network effect should push currency market caps away from equilibrium. The fact that Bitcoin is making such huge headway against entrenched fiat currencies is a promising sign. If Bitcoin does this well when the network effect is against it, what will it do when the balance shifts and the network effect is in its favor?

Loss of password is a big cause of lost bitcoins. I think the safest thing to do is a M of N fragmented backup using Armory. For example, you create three fragments where any two are required to recover the data. That way if any one of them is lost or stolen your bitcoins are still safe. Put one in a safety deposit box, bury one in the backyard and give one to a friend. You can also do 3 of 4, 3 of 5, 8 of 12, etc.

It's a chicken and an egg problem. Big businesses like Amazon aren't going to start accepting Bitcoin until it gets much bigger. Amazon's revenue in 2012 was 61.1 billion USD (source:  At bitcoin's current market cap of about 1.5 billion USD all bitcoin's currently in existence would have to be spent at Amazon an average of 40 times in a year to match that. When you consider bitcoins that are lost or are being hoarded, the bitcoins that are circulating would have to be spent even faster than that.
I think we will see many more small companies accepting it and building it up a little at a time before it becomes big enough for the really big players to get into it.

Something would have to go *extremely* wrong for bitcoin to completely die. Even if all the exchanges went down right now, there would still be some die hards who would continue to use it to buy each other pizza and send reddit tips. And as long as someone, somewhere, keeps it alive there will be a potential for a comeback. Even if bitcoin itself completely died, the cryptocurrency idea is out there. Someone would come up with a new version.

Some banks are already fighting it. There have been a number of exchanges that have shut down because their banks closed their accounts.


I think the day will eventually come when central banks and governments will start creating their own centrally controlled cryptocurrencies. The efficiency and security that cryptocurrencies provide for online transactions will definitely lead to the general cryptocurrency technology becoming standard, but there are many people who actually want their currency centrally controlled.

I completely agree that it needs to be a technological solution.
The issue here is traceability hurts fungibility. The fact that funds can be tracked from one address to another makes them distinguishable. If they are distinguishable then there is nothing to stop someone from saying "I will accept that one but not this one." As soon as one person violates fungibility it gives everyone who deals with that person incentive to do the same. As long as funds can be tracked, their fungibility is in danger.
It isn't enough to have untraceability available through mixing, etc. As long as people have the option to easily trace their funds there will be some people who do and/or favor those that do. We need a cryptocurrency that can't be traced even if people want to. We need a cryptocurrency with mixing built into every transaction.
