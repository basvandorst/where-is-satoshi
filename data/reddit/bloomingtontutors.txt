Congratulations, you've all just discovered game theory.

Even better!  Full-time developer on my OSS projects is my dream job.

Consider donating some of your new-found wealth to a few open source software projects that you like!  After all, Bitcoin is open source, and Bitcoin is what made you rich :-D
A lot of open-source projects that power the technology we use and make money from, are sadly underfunded.  Often times, even very large projects are maintained by just a few people working in their free time.  This would be a great opportunity to do something positive for the open source community.

Does the FSF exclusively fund GNU/Linux, or does it fund other open source projects as well?

Kind of a long shot, but someone could try building a corpora from OP's Reddit history, and running the bigrams/trigrams through btcrecover.

That's the point - if you're not bound by business decisions and deadlines, you can take the time to refactor your software, or rewrite it entirely, and make it _not_ spaghetti code.

Looks like the flag is `--data-extract`, not `--extract-data`.
Just tried:
- 000webhost password dump
As well as all combinations of:
    wallet Wallet
    %0,4d
    electrum Electrum elec Elec
    coin Coin
    pw pass password Password
No luck, but see [basics and mutual exclusion]( for an explanation of this powerful combinatorial feature.

Other opportunities will come along in life, cryptocurrency-related or otherwise.  Just keep watching for them, and take action when the time comes.

OP, the tool you provided (btcrecover) performs a _combinatorial_ attack based on a list of words.  Can you produce a list of words that you think might have been _part_ of the password?
I've already tried a small subset of likely words (wallet, electrum, coin, password, 1-4 digit numbers), but each additional word will increase the number of possibilities combinatorially.
Unfortunately I don't have enough computing power to try more than a few tokens, but if you can post a list of 10-20 words, and recall whether or not there would have been any numbers, then someone with enough computing power ought to have a decent shot.
