I lost it when this article showed the image of the affiliate program. I do feel bad for those taken in, but if you can't spot the pyramid image and wonder a bit...

Their whole Twitter feed has been off the chain today (no pun intended).

Good question, and possibly no better off than just hodling. I'm hodling some currency, but also thought I'd try trading with small (well really tiny) amounts. Mostly a fun hobby at the moment, but come tax time, I may feel otherwise.

I laughed at this more than I should have, but thank you. I needed a good laugh this morning.

I guess everyone has their own strategies and goals with day trading. I do a bit of day trading, and generally shoot for capitalizing on small dips where I can get a 1-3% return. If you learn to analyze the data, you'll start to understand where and when these opportunities occur. It's almost predictable...note that I said 'almost', meaning ~90% of the time. I've built an app for myself that does the analysis. Finding a way to wrangle the data for yourself will show you where to invest. Otherwise you are shooting darts in the dark.

I think there is regulatory review that still has to happen. I can't imagine this will launch before 2018.

Eh, still not too late by a long shot.

If bitcoin reaches 100K eventually, then that will be a hell of an inheritance.

I don't know if this CEO just has no idea what they are talking about? Or are they trying to troll or influence the market? I mean the IRS has ACTUAL documentation on how tax payers should treat virtual currency. And of course, there are very legitimate players in the industry who are interested in making money, ie, Winklevoss dudes at Gemini. I could go on and on, but why? These two points alone should be enough to prove legitimacy. 
In my opinion, naysayers like this CEO need to be ignored. They will eventually go away and gradually their voices will be drowned out. 
All that said, I think investors in this sector still need to be throughly educated. Don't let the excitement of this volatile field override common sense and thorough research.

Assuming 50k is the entirety of your liquid assets, I would not put it all in one place. The mantra around here is never invest more than you can afford to lose. You should diversify - ie, invest some in cryptocurrencies knowing they are volatile, but also invest some in more traditional vehicles, ie, stocks, your business, real estate, etc. 
As for accessibility to your bitcoins, they are always accessible if you store them in your own wallet. If you need to use these overnight, then it would certainly be simple if the payee would take bitcoin. However if you need USD (or another currency), you would have to find someone to buy your bitcoin. There are many different options, so you would need to explore which ones might be the most expedient.
As for gains, it's hard to have a crystal ball when it comes to cryptocurrencies. They are the wild west in the tech world these days. Those who frequent these subs (myself included), believe strongly in the technology, and the impact it will have. However, that is no guarantee that bitcoin will be around in 10 years or even flourish. Personally, I believe it will, but you should proceed with caution.
