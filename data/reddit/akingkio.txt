I want ~~drugs~~ bitcoins!

Have you tried looking into World of Warcraft or Runescape gold? I heard those were good currencies to invest in but come with an increased operating risk.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:36:59
Only if the black markets switch to alternative currencies, or they all get closed down due to vulnerabilities or enforcement.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:21:44
hmm last time I looked you could only trade keys, dyes etc.

For most it's just a pitiful, half arsed attempt at furthering the value of  Bitcoin, those urging people to "hold" are either deluding themselves or have already cashed out on the majority of their gambling winnings. But what would I know, I'm just a bored person on the Internet.

Sorry but for some reason your website is really hurting my eyes. The colour scheme and constantly moving dashes (-) are just off-putting to me as a viewer.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:21:58
It's all part of the gamble, not an investment like some would have you believe.

@_date: 2013-12-19 01:51:26
That is why is increases your risk.

AMA Request: a Bitcoin Multi-Millionaire?
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:41:50
So how many bitcoin do you actually have? Somewhere around 5750?
That's amazing, although even when they were $2 each I probably couldn't have afforded to buy that many!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:50:56
I got it thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:12:46
I spent all my bitcoin on drugs *and rock and roll*
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:29:24
Canada, Antarctica and the Bronx I think

You can also buy bitcoin through bank transfer and pingit at [bitbargain.co.uk]( and [localbitcoins.com](
As you mentioned they are are more expensive by around 10% - 15%, but if you want them fast then the premium will pay off as the current price fluctuation will catch up to the price you paid in a couple of days.

He didn't mention if what he as a bitcoiner could do had to be either good or bad.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:58:32
then drop it again for the next sucker to pick up.

Look at the ama request, then back to the user you linked then back to the ama request.
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:20:50
Is there a market for this type of thing? seems incredibly niche.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:47
disregard bitcoin, buy dogecoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:02
I don't know why I believed you and googled it.
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:01:44
I would be happy with just one.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:36:04
Just go lie outside for a couple of minutes, someone venomous will bite you eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:42:12
If not when.

Sweet, it's just money! Off to the bookies I go to gamble all of this months wages!
