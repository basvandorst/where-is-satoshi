I don't really like Roger-Ver maligning Bitcoin, but what he says in this case makes sense to me. Insider trading in an unregulated market is not a crime. If no law was broken, it's fair play (even though it might not seem fair).

Intrinsic is how noobs measure value. Smart people understand that value is never absolute, it is always relative. For those who use "intrinsic value" for Bitcoin; ask them what the "intrinsic value" of a hundred dollar bill is? (Hint: It's the same as a piece of paper).

Consider the case of India had where the Indian Gov. declared a demonetization" event in 2016: 
It would have been better for those people holding cash to own Bitcoin (or ETH, etc) which have global market value as opposed to a single country's currency which is more susceptible to unfavourable government decisions, rapid inflation (e.g. Zimbabwe). Bitcoin in itself is a globally elected political instrument/commodity/currency or whatever that has international market value and that no single government can completely "kill" its value down to 0 (without shutting down the internet). But positive/negative regulations certainly affect its market value.

Why doesn't he use ethereum for that ? BTC is a better value store and ETH is a better P2P transaction currency with ethereum network already much faster than what BCH is trying to be.

I think the special theory of relativity in physics can be applied to currency and economics. There is nothing absolute, you always need a frame of reference. It is always relative. BTC/USD, BTC/ETH, USD/GBP, BTC/GOLD. So you are right BTC will always need USD to gauge its value or any other random frame of reference for that matter and same goes with any other currency or commodity including USD itself. No currency, commodity, good or service has absolute value. It's all relative and that's what makes any market so interesting as inefficiencies create trade opportunities.
