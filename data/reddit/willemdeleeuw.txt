Historically tech stocks have been risky so of course you’d hope to do quite a lot better than the market but with a greater risk of underperforming in any period.  It seems to me that today the benchmarks for a lot of people are way off and they’re completely obsessed with shooting the lights out. The last time I saw it quite like this was in 1999/2000, another time where we saw huge gains in a very short space of time.  It messes up people’s heads, and particularly young men’s.

Who does that? Most people use the stock market.

2017 wasn’t a typical year for stock markets around the world. Generally, 8% is very good.

It’s scary when you can lose your life savings in an instant and all anyone can do is say, ‘SFYL.’

Sell.  It’s a greater fool, er, currency or commodity or whatever with no cashflows so how do you value it?

It’s also a status symbol and a nice thing.  Everybody needs a few nice things.

They’d like you to but no, absolutely not!  It’s a very strange mania.

Depends on the model.  My SS Submariner with date appears to have held its value relative to inflation very well.  If you’re young gold isn’t the way to go anyway in my opinion.  Also, they’re a lot more expensive.

Actually, it would be helpful if you could buy more.

No, there are at least two other factors.  There’s also the velocity of money (how quickly it’s being spent) and the expectations people have of inflation.

What is a gold coin? Not saying that gold coins are particularly great either but there are dealers all over and still better than lousy Bitcoin.
