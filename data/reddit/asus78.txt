Pretty much... I am located in Europe! I tried kraken but their mobile sucks. Binance I don't like. Can't believe they took down blockport. It was so simple using mobile  ��

It is non custodial, at no point ever do they own your assets or your keys. That is why it will be so unique eventually. Proof us wrong mate

Nice... I own a ledger, what do u guys think of Nash.io ? It will be a mobile solution with btc trading &amp; similar security to all hardware wallets they claim.
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:15:16
Why...pls explain. I am not big of a techie. These guys have a background in MPC I am sure they know what they are talking about. I really want it to work as they say...that would def be revolutionary.

Anyone heard of [Nash.io]( They claim to be as safe as hardware wallets but as app solution on a non custodial dex using some Multi Party Computation. I have no idea what this means...but it is supposed to be unheard of.

You guys seem to have the technical know how. Have u heard of Multi Party Computation? A dex called [Nash.io]( claims to be as safe as hardware wallets but as app solution on a non custodial dex. I have no idea what this means...but it is supposed to be unheard of. If it were true it would be friggin awesome!

Dude I would actually dance to his songs. What a legend
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:18:15
It is def not a hot wallet...it is a dex as far as I know. U cannot compare it to any hot wallet. Nash is supposed to be something revolutionary. If anyone has more knowledge than me on secure Multi Party Computation pls advise. Please see statement by the founder below...I dont understand much :-/

I am sure u dont know who this is...but u should google City Of Zion!
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:06:54
U will have to wait and see...follow their twitter!

Thanks for chiming in man...this sounds really promising. If I set my limit to 0.001 will it be possible for me to change that quickly any time I want to make a trade?!
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:58:50
Yes it does...just not sure what could happen if I lose my cellphone?! Can it be compromised. I guess having a ledger locked down in a safe is a bit more secure but on the other hand having similar security plus being able to trade on the fly has amazing benefits.

You wont need a Ledger Nano or any kind of ledger once Nash.io's 2nd gen Zero-Knowledge key management is ready (EOY).  Nash\*s software solution will be more secure and user friendly than a Ledger Nano device.

LOL - Well everything is scam until u take the time to find out it is not. Plenty of people just lost the chance to participate in the ADA incentivized test net because Binance did not allow to move ada. They want to keep it themselves and make money off it. That is scam to me.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:28:38
You should also read this [ \- PM me if you are interested in using nash.io
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:47:04
Can people pls stop using centralized exchanges and move over to DEX such as Nash &amp; Co! How can u trust those more than yourself holding your private keys?! Binance just forbid people to withdraw their ADA to participate in the incentivized testnet 24 hours before the snapshot. Guess what...they use your coins to get the rewards themselves. Pretty smart...very shady!
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:40:22
That's crazy.... How much was stolen from decentralized exchanges such as Nash.io or Switcheo? People just don't learn

If the German Euro bill goes thru at 1 of January 2020 Banks all over Germany will be able to buy/sell &amp; hold crypto currency. As we know from 2008 crisis banks (US BANKS AT LEAST) are able to sell the most toxic shit. So they will try to sell to everyone &amp; their grandma try to hedge and make interests on tokens such as Ada. I would say time to stack some coins. We are still early.
