I think if a hacker hacks into the company and steals everything, then  sure, roll back to before the hack happened and fix it.  In the real world if a company gets hacked the FBI would be called to try to recover the funds.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:35:16
Well if a hacker stole my funds cuz of a loophole in the bank's code should they just let it happen?

If you dont transfer to an exchange how are you suppose to day trade or cash out?
@_date: 2016-12-05 07:19:14
its kind like make $50k/year, but able to spend $80k I guess, best way to do it if you have no idea how to get around the tax loophole.

I'm 25, let me try to explain what i mean. There is actually no need to move it to bitcoin in the first place.  You need to try to sell it on the black market, but if you want to spend the money, it needs to be carefully laundered.  The government aren't going to count how much money you have to the penny.  As long as you don't go crazy with your spending and spend a bit more than what you report you should be fine.  If you do try to sell off $10k/m make sure you have a job that at least pays $5k/m and not unemployed or it won't make any sense. Here is sometime I might decide to try.  In Canada if you are a casual poker player, you can make some money and not report it.  I can enter some high stakes games and any winnings I make from a big first place tournament I can declare it as a poker win.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:51:55
maybe they traveled so far in the future that bitcoin is worthless and is a relic of the past.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:49:43
If you sell chucks of 6000 btcs 6 times, with small intervals then it can definitely discourage buyers from buying for the fear of continuing big sell off.

I think hes calling out ponzi promoters and people who charge a crazy amount for a useless crypto course.  I dont think he's in the same group of them.  While talking about alts he owns may have an effect on his holdings, I dont know if theres anything he can do about it.  Its kind of unfair to say "you are not allowed to talk about many investments you hold."  From what I can see, he does a better job of a lot of people out there in terms of full disclosure.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:29:52
He says here its a lease.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:26:03
its much more than that, Selling 6000 at one time at market order destroys the buy wall.  This will cause a "flash crash." If this happens 1 time it will recover as buyers come back in, but if you keep dumping 6000 btcs multiple times the sell pressure could convince others to also sell.  "If I suspect theres a chance the trustee can dump 180k btcs in an open market, why would I not wait till he does so then buy?"  If enough people thinks like this and holds off buying then the lack of buy pressure can definately keep these prices low for a while.  Not saying this is the only reason responsible for the crash, but I would say it definitely can be a factor.

I'm 100% sure at those rates the gift cards are carded and not legally obtained even with cash receipts.  That aside, even if you are using carded gift cards they should not hold your coins.

right, but if you go around trying to sell a pizza for $1, and no one wants the pizza unless its free, whats it worth?
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:02:42
no, you do not need to close your account, just keep the balance at $0.  The purpose is that a small percentage of people have fund in their account and forget about it.  They can legally take the funds from those people if it is clearly stated in their TOS that such a fee exist.

do you know how odds compare to other sites?
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:28:13
but your rock is different from mine as mine has a happy face.  I would sell you a normal rock for a dollar, but my face rock is for one million.  So you are talking about two different items.  You cant jsut randomly pick up a rock that looks like a face.  So the question is, is my face rock worth one million dollars just because I decree it is worth that much?  Which points to the question, does a market need to exist for there to be a price?  If there is 0 demand for bitcoins and only supply, is the bitcoin worth what ever the seller wants to sell it for?
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:50:49
I mean I cant believe no one has thought of use nash
@_date: 2013-07-16 16:10:21
What I mean is this
seller  sells 3.91 btcs for $85
Seller  sells 6.09 btcs for $86
Seller  sells 10 btcs for $87
I set a buy order to buy 20 btcs for $87 each, therefore It will take 3 sell orders to fill my buy order.  Right when I submit this buy order, seller  cancels this sell order.  I clicked buy the exact same time he clicked cancel, which confused the system resulting in me getting the  coins without having the funds deducted from my account and allowing the seller to keep his coins.  So now Cavirtex is down 3.91 coins cuz they gave me 3.91 extra.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:02:50
I don't think you understand how this works. Lets say you want to sell a BTC for $100 the following happens.
1. You put $100 in the box, and wait for a buyer to put $200 in the box ($300 in the box)
2. You send the buyer the BTC and he can lie or be truthful.  If he is truthful, he will send you $100. You then get your $100 back in the box and he gets back his $200.
3. He if is not truthful and lies, you blow up the box.  You will lose 1Btc+$100, the buyer will lose $200 and gain 1 btc.  In this case, the seller just paid $200 for a btc, which is not worth it for him and he has no incentive to scam you.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:14:15
Why would you not just keep the BTC for yourself instead of destroying them.  The buyer/seller doesn't care where it goes, as long as they lose it.  If I were you guys, I'd keep all destroyed coins for profit.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:49:33
by 3.a) I mean the seller loses 2 btc (the one he sent and the one in the box) and the buyer loses 1 btc (He loses 2 in the box, but gains 1 from the seller).  
3.b) is a tricky situation, so play the game with me, lets say you send me an Ipad and I decide to say F*** you, I am not gonna send you anything, you would rather blow up the box and lose the Ipad and 5 btcs, when you could recover 5 btcs?  I just don't see a rationally person thinking that way.
In the extremes its like saying you can walk away with a broken arm or you can kill us both, I am sure 99% of the people would choose to walk away with the broken arm.
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:19:31
if no one is willing to sell for $0 and no one is willing to buy for over $0 what is it worth on the market?

Let say I find a rock that is shaped like a face.  I want to sell it for a million dollars, but no one wants to buy it, but its still worth a million dollars just cuz I say it is?
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:21:40
Yes, but I feel its wrong that someone gives you $1000, you go on a nice vacation and have nice dinners, then a week later they want the money back.

so set a $100 max bet or something
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:02:48
What happened was I placed an order to buy 20 coins, from 3 different sellers, and right when I pressed buy, one of the sellers canceled their order.  So the coins were in my account but I was not charged for it.  I only realized it today when the CEO called me
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:55:38
why would you sell when its down, if you're expecting it to go up?  Lets say I pick the 15th of each month to trade, and it so happens there be a crash on the 15th , should I still sell at the low price or wait for the crash to recover?  
@_date: 2013-10-13 05:15:40
lets say its a 5v5 and to play everyone needs to put 1 btc as a wager.  If I throw, my friend wins 1 btc and I lose 1 btc.  I dont see how throwing helps.
Unless you get 5 friends and they form a team, and you join opposite team.  Then even though you lose 1 btc to one of your friends the other 4 wil profit from your team's lost.
@_date: 2013-06-21 23:50:46

I can't believe no one has thought of this.  I am an economics graduate and I think this is ingenious.  The dominate strategy here would to always be truthful since both parties lose when one party is unhappy.

I am 22 years old, and have invested everything I had at that time in it(bought at $115).  Which was about $2000.  Since then I have converted everything too litecoins.  I make money quite easily and not a big spender, so I didn't really care.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:48:07
but its also possible that no one will be willing to buy btc for over $0.
@_date: 2013-07-31 06:43:33
This way might be better than a 3rd party.  Consider this,  I want to sell you an Ipad for 5 btcs.  You pay and the 3rd party holds your btcs.  I send you a rock(worthless item) and claim I sent you Ipad, with tracking number.  The 3rd party must release my finds because there is no way of knowing who the scammer is.  Maybe I sent you the rock and claim its an Ipad, maybe I sent you Ipad and you claim its a rock.  With this nash method, I will not have an incentive to send you a rock because you can punish me for doing so by blowing up the funds.
However, in my other post, I stated that no one would ever blow up the box and it is not subgame perfect.  This is the only concern with the website.
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:09:17
There is one concern I thought of, and that is no one would ever destroy the box.  Lets say you want to sell a BTC for $100 the following happens.
1) You put $100 in the box, and wait for a buyer to put $200 in the box ($300 in the box)
2) You send the buyer the BTC and he can lie or be truthful. If he is truthful, he will send you $100. You then get your $100 back in the box and he gets back his $200.
3) The problem is if he lies.  If I was a perfectly rational scammer, I would think the following, would the seller ever blow up the box?  If I refuse to pay him he has 2 actions,
3.a) If I blow up the box, I will lose 2 btcs and he will lose 1 btc
3.b) If I confirm the transaction, I get my btc back, so I lose 1 btc, and the scammer gets his 2 btcs back so the scammer gets a free btc.
In this case, the buyer will never blow up the box and the seller should realize this.
Please tell me if there is a flaw with my thinking.

what price did you buy at and how much did you invest?
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:14:11
Right in the situation you described, you managed to save your child from further harm then punish the kidnappers, but how do you do that with this system?  If you save yourself from further harm by cutting your loses you cant hurt the scammer any further.
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:43:14
The method you described seems resource consuming, as they would have to inspect every package to make sure everything is in order.
And the situation you are describing is a game of multiple stages, the police is trying to prevent future kidnappings which is easy to do since they are not related to the victim in anyway.  If your child got kidnapped, would you say "I will not negotiate with the kidnapper because I want to prevent future kidnapping?" You don't care about future kidnappings, all you want is your child safe.  If you yourself is invested you only care about 1 thing that that is to maximize your utility. If this was some random kid, then yes you should not negotiate, but the case here, you are risking your own btcs. Idk about you, but not a lot of people will sacrifice 5 btcs just to screw the other guy, they would try to salvage what they can from the situation
Like I said in another post you got yourself in a situation where you can walk away with a broken arm, or kill us both.  99% of people will choose to walk away with a broken arm than to inflict further damage to themselves.
Sid enote: I personally would take this risk if I was a scammer.  I jsut need a success rate of 50% to breakeven.
