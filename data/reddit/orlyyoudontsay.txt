Just today I saw an article that Steam is no longer supporting it, mainly due to the user-incurred fees and price volatility.

Not much once the blockchain is downloaded. It's the initial download (130 GB) that's the killer. I let my system run for a week or so to completely download, sync, and build the DB before it was operational.

It's now common practice to disable cellular networks around protests, and similar activities. Read: disconnecting the internet.

You're right.

I think you're confusing New York with Washington. Your number is accurate, if you're only here during the winter.  
 
San Fransisco: 62% annual sunlight

Ups for Mint.  
  
Having the multimedia plugins out-of-the-box definitely helps, for those who are coming from Windows. Mint with Cinnamon is where it's at!
