So sorry, I had made a mistake sending funds and had to jump through lots of hoops but the security actually gave me peace of mind. It took a couple of days and I had the funds back like that. They were very easy to work with so this is surprising. Keep on it and I hope it gets resolved fast for you. Hang in there!

Please excuse me I’m a noob and I love crypto and learning lots. I missed last October as I got in November 17. Curious is there some sort of special thing on October 31st to commemorate the launch of BTC - Whitepaper . Does the day have an unofficial name? Or is Jan 3rd looked at as the day since the network came on then? Fuck it either way I’m making cake and ya all are welcome to celebrate with me or not. ������

@_date: 2018-08-08 15:23:50
YEP - EXACTLY - and they will be up and running by November - so you can count on all this stuff getting worked out. This dip down and all it's just a play to gobble up cheap BTC by institutions so when the trading goes live and settled in actual BTC - forget it. Fidelity and others are lined up as well to get this going. So many DEX's coming with custodial issues and FDIC backing... Shit is about to get real and FAST - Gobble up the BTC while you can! 
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:08:35
Actual BTC is better. That's what would be best. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:59:50
Rule 1 of crypto - people won’t figure it out and that’s why the custodial issues are a thing I feel. If regular Mom and Pop bought 1k of BTC on Coinbase next year will they have the keys to the wallet? Doubt it but if someone has info that would be good to know.

Went to a crypto meetup the other night and one point that was raised was that one of the guest speakers had made mention that while at Consensus in NY many convos revolved around private OTC trades of BTC rather than on exchanges. People still buying but with out the volume on the exchanges it could be another factor in keeping the price down somewhat.
Anybody else get that same sense?
Thoughts on BTC dipping to $6,500 and finding support?
All that to be said with the current price it feels like this is yet another opportunity to scoop up some BTC at a fairly good deal?

Now with CBOE discontinuing futures that are cash settled anyone thinking that the shorting madness maybe coming to an end? Been flirting with 4k and a move to the upside looks doable. 
IMO with Bakkt coming and having futures settled DAILY and in BTC that very well may have played some part.

 **"We'll 'Tame' Bitcoin" - CME Group's Leo Melamed**  \- last year - so to tame means to control or to MANIPULATE. You are damn right to go long. Tame means to short. After they have shorted the shit out of it... forced out weak hands, bought BTC at hella cheap prices now when they deliver on actual futures with settlement in BTC - they will long them and the proverbial bull run should be underway.

Bakkt will settle in actual BTC so they need massive amounts on hand. Once the VanEck ETF gets green light ETFs / derivatives. Fidelity Investments and many more folks launching crypto products and desks. They will long the shit out of it after buying it cheap.  CME Group's Leo Melamed: We'll 'Tame' Bitcoin - this was last year. I don’t know about you but “tame” in my dictionary means to control. To control means to manipulate so you tell me.... I listened to a major player from a private OTC firm and they are seeing 11 million dollar buys of BTC from institutions... Anthony Pompliano or “Pomp” has a great podcast and has the best people on who are deep in the game at serious big time firms and companies.

That I don't claim to know. I'm not a TA guy a chart guy or anything like that. I'm a HODLER and a noob but I DYOR like a jedi. I listen to smarter people than me who are actually in the industry. 
All that being said, from what I have seen and read and heard if you are using BTC - amount you may well need at least 2 full BTC. 
Folks like Tim Drapier and Tom Lee and others see this at well over 250k by 2022. 
My only suggestion is to BUY BUY BUY- what you can while you can. 
Institutions have been gobbling this up while it's cheap. Don't listen to Jamie at JP Morgan or those fools. They are and have been quietly behind the scenes buying BTC and setting up trading desks and other services to flood the market once things are a go. 
Again not financial advice always DYOR but after doing mine... knowing what I know... STACK and HODL  - and you will be fine!

Me personally, I don't think so. They tamed it got out the retail noobs FUDed the shit out of it via CNBC and other mainstream outlets. Got Warren Buffet to FUD it... Now with actual settlement in BTC they will have to have massive amounts on hand to settle at the end of the day. That is why I think Bakkt will be a huge force in moving the price up. They gobble it up cheap over the past year when they shorted it now that they have it and plan to settle in BTC they will go long on it. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:26:30

Something to consider.... Bakkts futures contracts are supposed to be settled DAILY and in actual BTC. This means they have to have the asset on hand EACH DAY! 
That would mean they have to have a significant amount on hand. How do you get a massive amount you buy at these record low prices.

It means we told you so. Folks who thought Bakkt was a flop when it launched are looking like clowns . It means that big institutions and accredited investors are Bakk-ing up the trucks to stack major sats at low low prices. BTFD! The halving is about 150 days out and folks at Bakkt / ICE plan to make some serious Corn next year and those of us who have HODL strong no weak hands will be rewarded.

We went to do that and it’s pretty easy - it’s where the AML KYC comes in. Like Coinbase or any exchange its photos of ids etc - for me not worth it as it’s was only $35 so whatever. I’m already on Binance Coinbase and whatever else. Just wanted to see first hand how easy it is.

Lightning network. However Stellar XLM is in pole position to lead the tokenization revolution. Faster, scalable, made for just that.  Real estate being tokenized already...

For the record they don't force you to. They accept FIAT $USD as well. I think most people right now are pretty much doing the same thing aren't they? I mean buying BTC with $USD and then selling it and converting it back to $USD so it's not like they are HODLers

The ETF aint dead yet. I think the CBOE one has a good chance to make it! 
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:58:38
All good points as to why CBOE will get the green light. Thanks for sharing.

In Seattle / WA - ALL weed is now Rec and anyone who is of age can buy it.  So IDK if that answers your question. I was just excited as I get to use 2 of my favorite things together. Pot Stocks and Crypto are also what I am invested in. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:52:25
Yes of course! 
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:22:16
Surprised at all the BTC didn’t drop to the $7ks for long? I thought it would have gone lower on the FUD but seems to be holding at $8k so thats some encouragement. Cheers! 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:05:32
Still the CBOE is still viable and has yet to be rejected as far as I know.

Oh I get'cha! Sure like some of those "blue laws" still on the books like where women can't wear pants or I remember there was one that said it was illegal to for people to get drunk in a bar in Alaska. :) 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:08:44
It's the CBOE EFT that I'm interested in - doubt it gets rejected. Agree?

The Feds won't do shit. They lack the funding and manpower. States rights and more and more states are making it legal. Be fun if they tried to arrest me. I could use the publicity.

Yes indeed!

I really enjoyed this and it gave some good historical perspective. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:04:04
Honestly I forgot- Not as much as Coinbase I'm sure - I was just too excited to see a real world use for purchase in store and wanted to feel like I was doing something to help with adoption and use in the marketplace. Next time I get some weed I will pay closer attention. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:22:46
When Moon? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:48:10
I forgot. I was just excited to see it and use it. Real world adoption in an early form for currency use I had to do it. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:47:19
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:34:35
No not really it’s actually becoming a massive industry and companies are now being listed on Stock exchanges, Canada legalized nationally last week so honestly no. Maybe to you in your world you don’t care and that’s ok but in the big picture and the rest of the world it’s a big deal and the $ going into the weed industry is MASSIVE

They have been mining BTC for years and they ain’t about to stop anytime soon

Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. BTFD  DCA HODL and StackSats..... if you don’t know what means ask someone.... and DYOR

Thanks, that's seriously the nicest thing anyone could say to me. :) Upvote for you sir! 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:01:04
Touche - yes it is an enormous issue and it needs to be addressed. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:24:14
I think that’s the same at this one. I asked if I could just send it from my wallet P2P but I was told they couldn’t do that yet and that yes you did have to buy it there then use. Still for me the fact that this is for me a case of early adoption and an intended use of BTC to be used as a currency so I was happy to jump through the hoops because I felt that I was doing a small part in the adoption process and embodying what the spirit of this entire asset class is about. ����
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:29:45
I did ask if I could send from my wallet on my phone P2P as it's designed - THAT was what I was hoping. I agree with ya :) Not trying to disagree with you

The trading in the first ever physically settled bitcoin contracts will be based on new protocols that will be specifically established for managing the security and settlement requirements of digital assets. Bakkt will also finance a separate guarantee fund for the purpose. (See also: Four Problems With Bitcoin Futures.)
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:23:53
BIG difference between CASH settled and BTC settled.

We will get to relive all those old BTC Memes from 2k17 of 5k, 6k etc...

Awesome, please keep this handy because it will be needed again to remind folks in about a year.

Yeah it could very well.

I think it’s supposed to be in May 2020 was what I read. I’m out having drinks right now but I will check again when I get home 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:17:45
I wish it would say that one their site - damn! All I see was cash settled. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:48:18
Sure, ok, you bet’cha buddy. And then those folks at ICE  / Bakkt, Fidelity Digital, TD Ameritrade, NASDAQ and others that have invested time money and resources into setting up their new crypto operations are just going to let it all go to shit... Sure. That makes even more sense.
Follow the money. Don’t listen to what folks say. If you follow the money it always tells the story. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:22:42
This is HUGE - physical delivery of BTC settled daily!!! That means they have to have a ton of BTC on hand to settle!

After every halving we have seen thus far it was followed by a bull run. 2012 halving  and 2016 halving.

" BitMEX offers several of its trading products in the form of a Futures Contract with cash settlement."

IMO there will be some corrections and retrace before breaking through $10k - be ready to DCA, buy the dip and stack sats

Hello Smart Community Members and Mods, 
Question, trying to DYOR and find out about bitcoin services inc. - My friends dad an older guy who doesn't know about crypto or BTC that much has some $ tied up and we are trying to find out how legit they are. We are firm believers in keeping our BTC off exchanges or third party custody and Nano it up. Rule 1 - Not Your Keys.... 
Continuing to source the web but I know we got some mad jedi smart folks here in the sub so any help would be appreciated. Thanks.  - Long Bitcoin Short The Banks!

Halving 2020 - every bull run has followed a halving. 2012, and 2016 respectively.
