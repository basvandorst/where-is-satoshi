Thanks for your reply - I love the feedback :-) 
True, English isn't my native language, but I hope the findings are clear anyway. Some of them is trivial and obvious, but there are some interesting findings which I assume will show in the ecosystem during the next years.
I am not going to compare a master thesis to a peer reviewed paper by experienced academics. Without doubt, their paper has a deeper use of theories. However, I think my thesis is an easier read which can be helpful for some.

Wow! That is very relevant, as I am going to stay at least a month in Manila from next week.
Cya there guys! Wednesday? :)

It has nothing to do with eachother.
Coinbase has the technology to handle any kind of cryptocurrency. That's what the investors believe in.
That means, even if Bitcoin fails, their effort will still prevail.
Very few people argue whether some cryptocurrency will become a huge thing, while a lot of people argue whether Bitcoin is that currency or not. Coinbase wouldn't care, as they can adjust to any technology.
Tl;dr -&gt; Coinbase is called COINbase, not BITbase.

Yes :) There are actually several about Bitcoin, especially the more technical parts (which is really good, by the way). I couldn't find any about the ecosystem though.

This is hardly surprising. 
At the moment we see big companies build amazing products around it, but until these products are revolutionary, people won't jump the boat. 
When Bitcoins actually becomes useful, as in:
* No fees when shopping online or in stores
* 1-2% Fee remittance, BTC -&gt; Local currency
Then we will see Bitcoin become a big thing. But now it is not sexy, irrelevant and "meh" for the public.
Give it 3-5 years of develop, and let amazing products evolve around it. Then, you will see. If not Bitcoin, then "Bitcoin 2" or whatever it is going to be called.

Nice site. I actually found several relevant routes :-)

Great news from BIPS! :) Good job.

The ones I've used so far, have worked like this:
4-5 Days before the new payment has to be due, I get a reminder via email. If I don't pay I get an email ~1 day before, and start getting warnings in the software.
Another solution is buying 3-6 months in a row.

Great to see it getting so much attention. We're already quite high compared to before this was posted on BitcoinTalk!

If you care about short term, no (and probably never). If you can buy and hold them for 5-10 years, it could possibly be the best investment in the world. 
I would invest and wait 5-10 years, but if it's shorter than that and you get nervous if Bitcoins suddenly are back to 25$/each... No.

I spent quite a lot time learning how to communicate with Bitcoin-qt in my software, so I wanted to make it easier for future developers.
Besides this .NET / C# wrapper, I also made a video series which helps people:
The wrapper is not perfect or very high quality, neither are the videos, but I sincerely hope some people find them useful, and start to make cool applications with Bitcoins :-)
