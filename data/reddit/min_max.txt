You once again completely miss the point. No one trusts Satoshi Nakamoto. Some people even think he may be part of the NSA - but that DOES NOT MATTER because people can review the source and guarantee for themselves that it is not malicious. That option is simply not possible with closed-source. Trust the code not the person.

1) Bitcoin can exist entirely on only two nodes - yes in practicality it needs everything you mentioned to be useful but it doesn't need them to exist, nor does the right it extends to the people that use it.
2) Never before has a person been able to store the "keys" to access their entire liquid worth in their head (brainwallet). Short of torture, there is literally no way for the state to take that worth away from an individual by force. THAT is the powerful point.

The name of the game is return on investment. Building facilities like this is extremely expensive and extremely risky as they cannot really be re-purposed for anything else.

Unless they figured out a way to digitize a physical asset, destroy the real world one, and then provide a mechanism to re-integrate that digital copy to the real world - no not really. 
They did figure out a way to price a market in direct relation to a physical commodity market but there is still no way to directly, without trust, create a unique digital token representing a physical object. 
(The only thing that comes close is Bitcoin's Proof of Work being a representation of electrical energy consumed, but it is not a 1 to 1 relationship as efficiency changes with each new chip developed)

Bitcoin as closed software would never have been successful. That concept is at direct odds with what the software stands for and what the original paper's outcomes were. The entire point of bitcoin is that the system is trustless. It is trustless because it is open source. It's mining function (and consequently its distributed nature) works because PoW is also trustless. 
The ideas of Bitcoin may have been reverse engineered and built into a successful open source project, but Bitcoin itself would never have achieved the market adoption we have today if it was closed source. People have a hard enough time as it is trusting governments with their money, let alone an individual developer.

Real quickly...
Durability: HD Poly Foam is the least durable of the bunch and usually lasts only a couple years before deteriorating. Memory foam tends to last roughly 10yrs. Latex lasts 20+ yrs. All foams are susceptible to oils and any exposure greatly reduces their life.
Feel: HD Foam is very spongy and exactly what you imagine when you think of how "foam" feels. Memory foam is very different, it retains shape and compression for a longer period (the whole memory thing). Latex is the opposite, it is very bouncy - a matress made entirely of latex feels more like a spring mattress.
Heat: Memory foam and HD Foam are very well known for being "hot" when sleeping on them. Gel memory foam does a good job of improving this (I use some on my matress). Latex foam is in between as it is much more breathable/dense. 
Cost: HD Poly foam is roughly $20 per inch in a king size. Good memory foam is roughly $50 per inch in a king. Latex foam is $100+ per inch.
Edit: Check out  and  for two foam/latex mattress sources.

"Looks can come later. "
I agree with this.
"There is no source currently because the project is in Beta and the developer has worked solely on this alone for months and wishes to get it working perfectly and getting adoption for open source is pushed out."
This point I don't understand. Millions of beta projects are open sourced and are collaborated on in real time. Bitcoin being one of them. Also, the UI code could be worked on by others while the developer focuses his energy on getting functionality working rather then wasting time on UI design/code that will ultimately be thrown out.

It is entirely possible they mined that amount, considering there are notes in the silkroad ledger about buying substantial FPGA miners before ASICs came on the scene.
The thing that casts doubt in the story for me is that PoM mentions that there are "no public addresses" for the 300k as it is a "wallet not an address". AFAIK there is no such thing as btc without being linked to a UTXO? Is he somehow referring to coinbase transactions?

Regarding Craig, I see a couple possible scenarios:
1) He's a full on conman. I give this 50% odds at this point.
2) He lost the genesis key and can't actually prove he is Satoshi, despite being him.
3) He stole the keys from the real Satoshi (or possibly taking credit from his dead colleague?) 
4) There is a vulnerability in ECDSA in which signing a message may make key attacks easier. The mere possibility of this may be enough to influence the desire to hold back a public proof. This seems quite unlikely however as I believe each of his subsequent (mined) block rewards would be on it's on separate priv key (correct me if wrong).
If all of those are false, his proof should be exceedingly simple (just as Charlie did).
