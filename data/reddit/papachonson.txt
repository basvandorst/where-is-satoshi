Side note: Wells Fargo has me for 10.9% interest rate on my private student loan and sent me something in the mail stating I could refinance my loans for a lower interest rate. I did all the paperwork and a hard inquiry on my credit (which was 740 at the time) and to my astonishment, Wells Fargo congratulated me on my new interest rate of 10.4%. I now regret some of the things I said to the poor Wells Fargo rep over the phone.

Manipulation is one thing but I checked out whether this was accurate or not and it certainly is. I am very interested to see where the chart goes on August 6th. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:10:56
Why am I not affected by any of this? Everything works as it always has..

Damn. I hope when they catch whoever this is, they are publicly hanged and then decapitated.

I don’t really believe South Africa would publicly hang and decapitate somebody lol I just wouldn’t mind if they did to somebody like this. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:37:53
Which is which?? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:25:53
Yes USA
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:27:30
Yeah never used as a wallet ever. Only if I possess the private keys will I keep it there... aside from occasional trading via Binance ofcourse
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:34:21
Wow, sound proof analysis. You sir have just done the impossible!!

What I would like to know is... 
What does “solving” consist of? If the prize is 1BTC then is the solution to find the private key in this image? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:35:12
Lmao what a wanker 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:37:42
Dude, what?

“networks breaks” ?? How do u fuck up the title!? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:22:25
Agreed. I foresee it ramping up around Sept-Oct
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:42:49
Not true.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:09:51
I wont be selling and rebuying on the 6th but i will be keeping a very close eye on this... more times than I care to admit I catch the numbers “666” in my daily crypto chronicles... its quite freaky but maybe i keep seeing it now because I’m subconsciously looking for it
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:26:25
You can do that if you work hard and walk a neighborhood landscaping 
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:40:35
Its insane and I couldn’t agree more.... 
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:16:50
Unfortunately, it sounds as though you were NOT speaking to Coinbase and rather a thief. I am sorry... this market is rampant with crooks because of the unregulation and early going of it. Karma will get them back and again sorry to hear :( 
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:42:54
Also not true.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:11:01
All you have to do is literally take 3 seconds ONCE in a 3 year period and make the smallest tiniest tiniest transaction on the network (you can vote for BP in literally 3 seconds) and that entire FUD campaign of them “confiscating” your EOS is non-existent. The reason they don’t want people sitting on their EOS for years is because staking them is what powers the network. This is a utility coin and not a store of value!!  
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:59:09
Whew OK I feel better now. Sorry OP for the loss tho :/ nothing u couldn’t make back in 1 day of hard work tho
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:22:42
Do you have 25.120 worth of BTC? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:09:11
So if it’s $10,001 am I not getting a good deal? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:06:38
Yeah... no
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:06:35
A one world currency that JFK tried to warn us about seems a lot like it could be bitcoin. Idk BTC ATM’s popping up everywhere across the world? Hmm
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:21:40
So far the 6th phenomenon is holding true!!!! 
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:50:26
Interesting. Whose putting them down and whose picking them up??

I am not religious in even the slightest... but I can appreciate others religions, they just hold no weight for me. Some may argue the anti christ has been here all along!

Censorship at it’s finest! 
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:31:57
I believe people are taking advantage of others more frequently and easier without repercussions due to this being a new and emerging market. It’s the crypto wild wild west!

Thether is supposed to be backed by $1.00 so as to be a “stable coin” well Bitfinix “lost” $850 million dollars and tried to cover it up by taking all those $1.00 USDT backed dollars and used them to hide the deficit. Big deal. NY Attorney General is creating a lawsuit. Bye bye USDT and Bitfinix ����
Crypto as a market gets shook when news like this breaks and there is always a sudden drop like we’ve seen. It will come back. Enjoy the fire sale!
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:44:44
Is it possible bitfinix is dumping BTC reserves to cover the missing $850million
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:16:41
U’ll have a mess when that glue is no more
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:32:30
Whoaaaa howd they think this was going to play out.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:43:48
I agree with your logic but this market is anything but logical... makes you really think whats truly at hand here.

If BTC hits $50 you bet ur ass Id buy a boat load 
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:44:16
I was really unaware that BTC’s price could move down... who would have ever thought that was possible?! Surely I am not alone... ��

You live up to your email address

Yet it’s still listed on many exchanges and supported by hardware wallets, talked about religiously and is also very well known. This coin fucks. Just copped 50,000.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:55:10
Exact same problem, you figure it out? 
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:10:54
Fuck it, i’m in! 
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:52:42
So is it rogue? Like who’s steering the ship?? 
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:59:32
It doesn’t work that way..... 
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:42:22
This worked for me thank you! I was being impatient ��
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:34:52
It’s good because market consolidation is necessary for growth. On the large scale of things we are still way up in terms of overall percentage. You need dips for bull runs... never a better time to increase holdings too. Crypto will benefit the patient, I guarantee you that! 
Disclaimer: just some random dude... these are my opinions and in no way actual financial advice.

Is this not? You have proof otherwise??

Does anyone here actually own any Doge? Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:02:03
Haha well I don’t disagree with that... for those that weren’t early investors, the market seems to be in a lot worse shape than it really is. If price keeps dropping my suggestion is not to panic sell (unless you NEED the money) because only once you sell, is when you lost!!! 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:22:11
Well considering you should go into an investment with the thought you could possibly loss everything you’ve invested... I would just say loss... you cant lose more than you invested lol but a stop loss is a topic for another day. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:26:11
Its good. I hope this gets rid of all the “make me rich overnight” investors.... 
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:40:06
Unfortunately, this is all true. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:19:06
Def a spike as everyone mining will now have to purchase to aquire and the supply and demand should increase but I think we have a few years if im not mistaken

What are u smoking and where can I get some?
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:49:14
Buy as many bitcoins as you can as quickly as you can and hold on for dear life
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:26:31
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:36:48
So then why wouldn’t you want as many USD as possible if you were to sell your 1btc? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:48:34
Interesting. Makes sense for them... 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:02:01
They (Chase) refunded my higher than normal fee’s without me even inquiring over a month ago and they continue to allow me to purchase crypto so no complaints from me! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:58:05
Anyone who takes a side with this type of post will be the same people saying they wished they invested in btc when they had the chance. Mark my words! 
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:17:58
I don’t get the joke but i’ll take ur 1btc for 3500 
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:02:52
Haha yeap mine looks the same!

If one were to say, 
“Hey! You know that really bullish cup and handle pattern yano the one everyone longs for?” 
Might you respond with an image somewhat similar to what we have in front of us at this very moment? I might... let’s see how this post ages ��
