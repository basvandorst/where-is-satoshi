I think successful adoption of the lightening network could have very good consequences to bitcoin’s prices. Although recently, the price has been driven more by speculation than actual utility. Much of that is due to the effect of futures on the stock market, and that could continue to have a significant speculative effect.

(To be clear, what I just said was a joke.)     
    
It's true that coin base's fees are high (in the 3% range on the buy and sell, depending on the volume), but if it's just a one-time purchase for a gift and you don't intend to perform a lot of transactions after that, it might be worth it to you.      
     
Or you might wait until early in the a.m. when GDAX isn't experiencing such a high volume to verify. That's what I did and it seemed to work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:59:07


      
I think you are severely misinformed about what's happening in the bitcoin market right now. The only "goods and services" rendered, outside of a few niche places where you can trade bitcoin for real goods in services (like darknet markets), are those that make speculators believe, psychologically, that the price to a useful currency will go up or down.       
      
If you aren't aware of pump-and-dump schemes, and how they operate in cryptocurrencies, then you're extremely naive.

Your assumption isn’t that it’s unregulated (that’s just true by definition), it’s that that means there’s no corruption and manipulation. That that simply a terrible assumption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:59:26
Here’s let’s go back to your original quote and what I disagreed with:       
        


      
The last part may very well be true, but it doesn't follow from the first assumption (which is false anyway). The U.S. dollar is no longer backed by gold, and when it was, it's value was prone to crashes anyway.          
            
Notice I never said bitcoin wasn’t speculative? Notice I never said there would be huge swings? In fact if you knew anything about bitcoin, this is just a truism — it dips all the time.         
       
But what I did say, and this fact wouldn’t change if the bitcoin went down to zero, is that US currency is **not** backed by gold.        
         
Now go post this wherever you want. Because any sub with any public visibility is just going to laugh at you like we did because you’re wrong.

A better analogy would be if you owned Microsoft stock and bill gates owned 40% of Microsoft stock, and the stock was traded on an unregulated market where Gates could pump and dump his stock to manipulate the price to his advantage. That's why there are laws against this in the stock market. There are no laws against it in the crypto market.

There are laws against manipulating prices through schemes like “pumping and dumping”. There is no such law in the bitcoin world.  Such schemes would be very easy, and many speculate they are happening.

Suppose you have a ledger that recorded all transactions you made with your friends. That ledger is the one everyone looks at to verify who has what. But two weeks go by, and you make a copy. This is essentially what a fork is. Why would anyone care about your copy of the ledger? Two more weeks go by, and your copy is still as it was two weeks before, and nobody gives a shit because they are still writing to the same ledger they were before, and they are still using that ledger to verify who had what. Nobody gives a fuck about your copy of the ledger.      
      
Of course, what you could do is try to convince a bunch of your friends that this copy of the ledger is fundamentally better, and that they should use that one instead. Then what you do is create a bunch of transactions on it to pump the price up, then you can just dump all of your fake ledger transactions and get rich if it. This is how you “create an altcoin”.

Great! Now be aware that waiting for their deposit can take a week or more, and moving cash from you account to your coinbase account will take about a week too. Which might be a good thing, since it gives the market time to figure out whether it’s going up or down after these dizzying gains.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:58:54
Once again, this is a poor assumption. There is [wide speculation]( that the NSA can already break TLS (THE security protocol for communication on the internet) with a high probability IN REAL TIME, and there is even speculation that, due to their access to massive resources, they can break RSA keys.     
     
The point is that we just can't assume anything, especially with an organization as massive as the NSA and one who employs the top experts in the security field. Peer reviewing by experts and following good practice is critical, but security is still almost a faith-based discipline. Even in a science as based in mathematics as cryptography, there is no mathematical proof that any practical method is 100% secure, it has been shown time and again to be resistant to assumptions.

Honestly, my advice might be to wait a few days and research your options. Seeing everyone suddenly flock to bitcoin feels a little too much like mania — and that is a big sign of a bubble. Today after huge gains in the market this couldn’t be more of a concern. Here’s my personal tip: if you feel a sudden and uncontrollable urge to HURRY UP AND BUY IN, you might want to take a step back and think about it. Figure out what your options are, do some math with the various exchanges / ATMs or whatever, and decide what is best for you.

You risk getting killed with transaction fees with that strategy

This would be hilarious.

Haven't seen bitcoin this stable since 2007.

Pretty big selloff happening. Related to news of NK missile?

Well, we know Coinbase uses hamster-wheels to power their transactions now, so maybe they are using carrier pigeons to communicate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:51
Well at least you kept the receipt, right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:09:39
Meanwhile, NK launched a ballistic missile

I would advise against this. You're just taking a risk of losing that money if something happens to the exchange, and you get no real benefit. Just save your money until you have a suitable amount that won't get wiped out on transaction fees.

That's correct. It's a psychological phenomenon and there's no reason mathematically to anticipate $10,000. However, contrary to popular believe, markets are driven by psychology, and not mathematics.

Yeah! How dare they provide a service to trade unregulated magic money and then have performance issues on an unpredictable spike in volume! There should be a law against not being able to predict that!

Outstanding reason on which to base a grand theory which has eluded millions for a decade. Sherlock there cracked the code.

I think it looks exactly like the article that was written when BTC was $1000.

Prolly like a million. Or a billion, at least.

... but in the end bitcoin didn't crash, it just stagnated.

How are you transferring the money?

This is why, in my opinion, bitcoin is not the cryptocurrency of the future. There are other coins that are much more efficient.

You know how you can go to Walmart in Cincinnati and buy a pack of beer for $10, but when buy that same pack of beer in Washington it's $12? It's like that.

It’s a wonderful virtue to be able to be completely engulfed in flames and yet do nothing whatsoever to save yourself.

This is like a casino owner telling gamblers that they might have "invested" wisely if they didn't bet the house on craps.
