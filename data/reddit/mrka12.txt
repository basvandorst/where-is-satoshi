The only people I know that bought into bitcoin are normies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:41:23
I'm so excited to watch bitcoin die so I can see people like you lose everything
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:39:18
Maybe, but if you saw what the idiots on my facebook were posting about bitcoin you might agree with me.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:17:27
Is this sub finally becoming self aware?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:16:41
Oh so it's like bitcoin but it took 100+ years when bitcoin only needed a few months
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:22:00
Except fox amirite?
Trump painting the media as enemies is probably one of the most damaging things he has done.
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:34:46
Socialism doesn't mean no personal property. How are people still this misinformed on a word that has existed for so long?
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:38:12
Yea, this way you'll only be down like 60% instead of 75.
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:43:56
And no peak has ever had grandmas attempting to buy bitcoin until this last one. What is your point
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:01:41
Yea and a massive amount of the people holding now bought at minimum 6k, not at .06
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:34:16
Free market at work dumbass
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:04:29
Not really a choice, you fell for a get rich quick scam. But you have the chance to minimize losses but you refuse to.
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:48:48
300k in 2 hours!!!
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:00:15
Because people bought at 15k+ lmao
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:25:08
I thought the 30% only applied to system calls?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:17:19
You are literally just randomly guessing
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:51:16
Brightest minds?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:16:19
This comment is why I love the red
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:13:26
He is a red piller. That is enough to be pathetic. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:59:25
Except bitcoin will never reach the same mainstream appeal it did when it went to 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:18
haha yea! The real treasure is in our hearts!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:15:10
I love this. Everytime someone says gpu prices in a btc thread some retard comes and says "OMG BITCOIN USES ASIC CARDS YOU RETARD NOT NVIDIA HAHA LOOK HOW SMART I AM"
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:47:28
Why the fuck didn't you sell at 7k, or 10k, or 15k or 17k or literally any reasonable time.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:25:48
I thought 310 was for women only
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:54:55
This is what they said at 6k. And 7k. And 8k. You get the picture
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:09:40
What does this have to do with anything? Plenty of people are depressed, the difference is I will make in 1 job what your "boys" make in 2. With no debt because I worked from 16 to pay for it. 
I will bet my life on the fact that people working 70-90 with no "loser" friends would be more depressed than any other.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:35:55
He made an account just to tell people something they already know. People aren't saying gpu prices are tied to bitcoin directly. they are tied to altcoins, and altcoins prices are tied to bitcoin as you saw today.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:31:39
Not by much? lmao ok buddy
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:28:20
He is a red piller. He literally thinks women are objects. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:04:46
He very clearly has no friends because he sacrificied an entire half of his life to work, which is why going to bars or doing literally anything other than working is for "losers"
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:29:48
Yea so were stalins 5 year plans if you only care about economy.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:18:22
Thank you for this comment, you said literally everything I was thinking. He is taking the extreme of debt, i'm graduating next quarter with 5k debt and everyone else I know is graduating with 0-10k, mostly 0. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:53:21
It's not a correction. It's someone trying to sound smart.
How is it a strawman in any way? I'm not arguing with anyone lmao. Maybe go look up what strawman means before using it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:02:31
Or I could do literally exactly what you did by getting a good degree and having only 1 high paying job with plenty of time to hang out with "loser" friends doing "loser things".
You're pathetic
E: I was wondering why your attitude seemed to familiar. You're a red piller. Makes sense, I doubt anyone would ever want to be with someone that has your disgusting attitude. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:29:45
"I can't deal with analogies so I will just say something really stupid"
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:11:35
so where is your 50m networth? Oh wait, you lost it all gambling on bitcoin :/
