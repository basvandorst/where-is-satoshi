Indeed, but one must be willing to pay 20% more than someone with a CC and exchange account. Not exactly a level playing field....

There's tons of them that are also in a position to buy BTC? I find that hard to believe. Nice idea but it won't fly until and unless people can buy BTC easily (without a CC or bank account).
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:07:38
Hardly makes sense then since the prediction is for April 2013
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:12:21
Good point, but if one doesn't require a speedier transaction, the fee can be omitted can't it?
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:15:53
Seems to be posted at end of March 2013. Quite a bold prediction then, if of course, as one reply suggested, it wasn't an April Fools joke (which to my mind should always be done on the day - 1st April)
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:22:42
Do you mean Eurozone? It's actually quite hard to buy BTC at market val in the UK, for example, which was in Europe last time I checked.
Not to mention that not ALL of europe have access to bank accounts, which is what the point was about.

I live in London. Reading that rent figure just made me want to cry. I was paying 3x that just to share until recently :(

Sorry if its been mentioned already, I read a lot of the comments but not all. Can anyone tell me if this dump contains any passwords?
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:17:10
hang on ... have Netflix themselves said ANYTHING about this? If not then it's speculation backed by nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:02:01
I don't see how anyone can currently invest wisely in BTC when the failure of a single exchange can simply wipe more than half the value off in a couple of hours
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:32:59
Surely this was just standard anti-fraud procedures!?
I've had this happen with non-BTC stuff, like when I got into gambling for instance and multiple depo's to online bookies flagged up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:23:46
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Firstly, anything can be stolen. Secondly, there are numerous stories of Bitcoin wallets being stolen from personal computers and indeed hack attacks on exchanges and suchlike.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:37:15
Yep, awful, and saving on fees by batching transactions and paying less than the recommended
I'll put these on the 'to-be-avoided' list
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:45:53
This has NOTHING to do with MtGox. Can we keep it relevant please so the thread is readable?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:01:43
Not particularly. Takes more than a bunch of kids on an online forum to upset me. As you were...
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:26:03
Yep. I agree with this mostly however I'm unsure as to the effectiveness of fiat-cost averaging with a security that can lose 50% of its value in 24hours. Saying that, I myself am considering buying more if I can get fiat into my exchange before the price gets above 700 USD. EDIT : Also, profit isn't profit until it has been realised through liquidation ... The one who buys, holds and never sells, never makes a profit
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:41:37
it's already traded below that. What a completely awful prediction.
EDIT: I'm wrong, Bitcoinity now uses Bitstamp as their default USD market it would seem, hence my mistake.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:32:35
I'm finding it easy to hold too, but then, I bought in at £3.50/1BTC so even a get out now would represent a huge profit. I don't agree with the first part though, I still care. Those losers at MtGox have halved my profit and can't even apologise properly. BTC needs new, decent exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:49:13
It is their capital controls that are at risk. Chinese government make it VERY hard to get money out of the country/currency. On that basis, is it not reasonable they see BTC as a threat?
The excuse isn't laughable, it's the reasonably expected excuse that they (and other governments) would/will use.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:17:36
I hate to defend MtGox (they don't deserve it), however there are practical issues with using 3rd party cloud services to host clustered and scaled highly-transactional websites and systems. They are mostly based around latency. I won't identify my employer but suffice to say, we run an online system which is very similar to an exchange in that we "enjoy" huge spikes of activity and we process financial transactions. MtGox however seem to have never broken out of their garage and into the data centre.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:11:01
Excaclty - the environment they designed/built was never scalable in the first place. They weren't setup to handle success, plain and simple. Im well aware of the technical difficulties and I think that should go without saying, however plenty of other companies, including my own, manage to handle high-transactional websites and build scale into the platform as and when required. We also communicate to customers when things aren't working. These guys are a bunch of amateurs. Were it not for reddit, I wouldn't know there was any lag on their trading and would simply assume the price I am looking at is current, not an hour old. Trading on an hour-old price is impossible, yet they let it continue and didn't make a statement till well after the event when a lot of people lost a lot of money and weren't in a position to do anything about it for the most part.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:57:44
Yes, When one is monitoring the market for their sell-price or to make sure said market doesn't crash.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:42:16
You don't consider that TRUST might be an issue here?!
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:15:05
My word - the very facts a) this has been possible and b) they are only just fixing it … well, I can't say I have much confidence. It should make a difference clearly, but if their trading platform is *this* bad, what other deficiencies are there that they are not telling us?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:24:53
In hindsight, no, however the market could well have crashed to zero after that too.
If you care about your investments, monitor them ... seems like a simple thing to do to me.
I was there in the April crash. I was monitoring it. I did not cash out and could have profited without having to 'ignore the price'.
Seriously ... suggesting people invest in something, forget about it, then check back in pre-determined amount of time (based on nothing but a figure pulled out of the air or the previous crash metrics) ... is absolute nonsensical. Anyone who disagrees with me on this point is to my mind, one of the people that I suggest deserves to lose money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:45:00
Check on blockchain.com or whatever.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:40:50
I would like to know why you don't suspend trading when your 'lag' is at an hour and the market is in meltdown largely due to that fact.
Much of this could have been weathered were you to have SUSPENDED TRADING!?
As for PR - How about a good old bloody APOLOGY!?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:14:30
Indeed, however it IS their job to protect their customer base from their own inadequacies - this they failed to do in monumental fashion. I am sure the poster above was stating the favourable conditions as an unintended consequence of suspending registrations - which is NEVER going to be favourable for an exchange and their profit.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:19:13
I know what he means.
The point(s) still stand...
Investing is gambling. (no, really, always)
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
Initial investors could have lost just as much as those buying in November, or now (or at any other time).
Not monitoring investments is not an efficient way of investing (or indeed gambling).

"It's touch and go right now."
Pretty laughable!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:16:38
You have a point, but its not the full story. Holding cash is a gamble, that's correct, but the volatility of a 'stable' currency is a very very very low risk gamble.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:38:38
It doesn't worry you that the meal you bought potentially cost you twice as much (in fiat or BTC) as it would have done the day before? The lack of price stability is the biggest reason it currently cannot be used with confidence by many people in the way you have described
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:50:19
Ok, so if we are to buy, hold, ignore, then sell.... How long should one wait? Is that not a gamble in itself?!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:49:37
Worst. advice. ever. BTC could crash to ZERO in 6 months and someone doing this would be none-the-wiser and would have missed multiple opportunities to get out.
Anyone who invests and then does not monitor it, to my mind, deserves to lose money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:00:27
I hope and I think that MtGox will have lost their market share once things settle down and the clever coders who have been watching MtGox destroy themselves over the last few days (along with a lot of peoples value) will build quality alternatives. MtGox have let the community, and themselves down. They clearly understand very little about high-transactional online services or indeed business planning.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:46:23
Don't gamble what you cannot afford to lose.
Pretty simple really.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:55:05
Probably because a currency with such volatility in its price is pretty much USELESS for its intended purpose of purchasing things - expecially given that it takes a fair bit of time to process a transfer. Imagine you buy something from me for 1BTC when the price is 100USD and the item to me is worth 1BTC/100USD … but by the time your payment has gone through, 1BTC has crashed to 50USD. Doesn't leave the seller in a perfect position. Can also happen the other way round if the price rises sharply. Bitcoin won't be taken up until the price volatility corrects and stabilizes itself. Also, all the negative press doesn't help.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:12:43
Are you sure this was the UK?! Was this from a work computer?
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:37:07
Ahh yes of course, I dissed dogecoin on a bitcoin sub, cue downvotes and cue even more flying fucks.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:05:34
You're correct, you'll have to excuse me. I've just this second realised that bitcoinity changed the default market to Bitstamp, which DID trade below 400...
EDIT: I still think it's a dreadful prediction, time will tell.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:51:40
Seriously, who gives a flying fuck about dogecoin!?
Stick to the altcoin subs please, getting kinda sick of hearing about some pointless altcoins specifically on a sub about BITcoins.
It is like reading a sub on the USD/EUR market and some fucking chump chiming in to say that the Yen is doing well against the £.
Go. Away.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:49:16
Can you please link to where it is said they will 'fix' it on the 17th?
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:16:04
I'd argue the DDos is potentially the same problem. They're clearly spending CPU power on trades that will NEVER complete …. that's a DDosers paradise!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:56:56
There is no conspiracy! MtGox (80% of all market trades apparently) are just a hugely shoddy operation. They also at least partially admitted a Ddos only a week or so ago. It's not infallible at all … it looks pretty damn vulnerable to me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:57:12
If you tell yourself and others a lie enough times, you might all start to believe it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:15:30
Ok, I take the point, but dodgecoin, shitcoin, noteveninventedyetcoin etc are infinitely more vulnerable than BTC, not to mention that they are covered in other subs.
