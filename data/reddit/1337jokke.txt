i wish i was in the US so i could utilize things like this =/ Besides i dont really like green tea. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:49:07
so? its not like it cost them anything?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:47:30
i dont quite get what you mean. how does it take a full day of accountant work to sort transactions from coinbase?           
Also, 7000-300 = 6700 which they might not have gotten otherwise
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:04:53
you get usd from coinbase i reckon.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:36:31
you got any **real** numbers on these or are you just pulling these from your ass?
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:29:44
**DO NOT CLICK THIS**
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:29:15
3% of the current 220k is ~7k. im pretty sure "accounting overhead" costs are way less than that.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:46:19
I used them a while ago to learn the basics of blender. Havent had time to learn more but ill probably get a membership when my huge tests are over or so.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:27:46
skies and see!
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:20:00
Not in the UK either sadly. Besides, postages from the US are ridiculously high compared to other places. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:59:05




Now youre just nitpicking. they probably pay less than CC transactions for taking BTC  and theyre getting extra money from taking it so why wouldnt they take it?
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:30:47
Ask your mother
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:33:37

someone open it up while jailbroken and have a CPU monitor up there somewhere to see whats happening?
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:07:19
Is there anything to gain from this, or is it just to help the network?
@_date: 2012-07-17 14:24:52
[Coincidence? i think not](
@_date: 2012-03-25 22:15:39
i dont honestly know.
i WOULD think that they would be staying there until someone would find the wallet. or just stay there forever? imagine throwing your wallet into the sea. someone MIGHT find it but its really not going to happen.
these are my thoughs on this subject. hope someone who actually knows what he is talking about arrives soon :)
@_date: 2012-07-13 21:57:56
So, i had some small amount left in my wallet, and decided to buy the [HTV]( guide :)
@_date: 2012-12-17 13:05:05
[im just going to throw this out here and hope for the best ;)](
@_date: 2012-12-30 11:21:31
Oh wow! thanks buddy :)

Just because of a shitty company? 
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:14:54
last chest open but wtf? i did something and mtgox says it wont redeem a compressed key and i have no idea how to use brainwallet
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:38:34
how about you give a hint on chest 4 ;)?
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:21:49
No to electricity, but i dont think the card would sell for almost anything. And for the electricity i meant that if it costs more in electricity costs than it brings me then i might aswell ask them for the money straight up so theres no point. but theoritically, could i hook it up to an old mobo and a small power source and put it to mine bitcoins?            
 
And yeah didnt know that of tha butterfly labs, just stumbled upon it and thought that it could make a profit with those specs. but apparently not.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:21:00
Idk lol. I just googled paysafecard ok pay and read some of the articles and thought thisd be possible.  
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:34:01
aw cmon man it doesnt need to be super duper hard. why wont you think of the children ;__;
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:09:27
yeah but thats cos you had your GT550. and thats nvidia. nvidia cards dont really mine bitcoin well.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:27:34
Thanks, ill definitely check this one out.
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:39:14
no &gt;:D
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:31:54
US only sadly.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:10:34
there is no fee i blieve. it is a 1% discount code.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:14:45
i dont live in a major city here in Finland, so cash purchases would require me to travel ~100-200km (at 8-10L/100km at 1.6€/L thats almost 30€) so it probably is not worth it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:12:35
Finnish actually.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:23:00
worked for me on chrome
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:32:08
nor is it quantum encryption or any mix of those words. what the fuck now ;__;
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:00:06
          
aaaand its a scam
@_date: 2013-02-10 11:54:13
eh? i have no idea how this should be read and what does each color represent... 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:20:56
true but i can probably get them somewhere for ~740 without that much effort so i would probably want that.
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:59:19
a typical furry. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:27:20

@_date: 2013-11-18 18:14:25

@_date: 2013-05-28 18:53:49

@_date: 2013-12-02 18:20:23

@_date: 2013-04-16 18:09:40
As a Finn i can confirm this.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:10:42
You dont get codes anymore IIRC? Idk but we can sort that out later. Just PM your adress and the amount and ill send it when i get home. Thanks for this btw :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:18:17
How can i buy one of these and how much does one cost?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:58:26
you must mean?
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:27:46
~1 month now of no answer but "cant process refunds" (i didnt want one) and "we will answer right away".
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:11:03
Obviously someone hasnt had an account on sites like Brazzers and realitykings. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:02:16
Nice find!      
"Ridiculous price of 60$/1000BTC." heh.     
"A scam" yes totally. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:32:12
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:09:13

@_date: 2013-04-14 03:54:06
over 1.3 mil? bitcoinbillionaire at his finest
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:24:05
i thought so too at first, but its still great. especially the street pickups thing on RK is great IMHO. you cant find full vids of those in a heartbeat.      
but seriously talking, if i had to pay the 80$ for it, i wouldnt do it. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:34:43
Wow such moon.           Much doge.     
So xmas.              Wow
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:02:20
did you get it? i managed to figure it out but mtgox says "may already have been redeemed"
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:39:12
Confiscating is legal. Stealing is not. They did not steal anything. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:19:08
got to  already. stuck and out of bitcoins to get hints ;__;
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:27:57
Yes. and trust me its a lot better.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:08:44
yea i checked that out too, but needs some verifications to order with eur. (name and adress  n such for trade with virtual currencies and "real" verification for eur) if im not mistaken
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:24:57
aww man y u always gotta do these when im just going to go to sleep =/     
GL to everyone then :)
@_date: 2013-08-06 18:20:02

@_date: 2013-12-10 10:18:59
Its america, so yes. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:00:12
Oh sorry i should have been more specific (stupid me). Put a custom price and 1$. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:39:09
Thats why you get an account that doesnt charge to withdraw money. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:05:00
Yeah theres the localbitcoins site i might try out.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:39:41
They confiscated them because they were acquired from illegal business. Not stealing.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:18:44
Please do this, record it and put it up on youtube.  
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:56:31

@_date: 2013-05-19 22:07:05
yeah managed to figure them all out about an hour ago. cant wait around for the private key hint as i need to go to sleep. Good luck to the one who gets it :) shame i didnt have time to get this one to the end but better luxk next time.    
and op: thanks, had fun with this one will def try to do the next ones if i happen to be on the computer then.
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:39:42

@_date: 2013-12-06 09:57:12

Youre welcome
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:26:35

@_date: 2013-10-01 15:20:18
Welcome to the NSA watchlist bro. And on your main account too? Ouch.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:42:38
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:58:20
Im pretty sure that all who use BTC know not to travel to south africa to receive your fortune of 5000 BTC left by a nigerian prince. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:18:37
stuck on the 4th =(
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:05:49
The second option sounds best.
