Can you tell me why you are so sure with this?
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:11:19
No not the seed. I ment the real key

I extracted mine Form electrum and it is much longer. So I am a little bit confused.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:17:28
Is it also possible, that I exported a list of privet keys. As every line has the same length?

I have a list with  26 line. Every line has 52 characters. Every single line could be a private key for me.(matching to every line with the private key I also have the public adreee)

Thank you. But how is it done in practise, for example when I hold them on a adress on electrum. How can I split the coins? Does the wallet itself decide weather it what to belong to the new or the old chain? And if yes do I simply have to look for an other wallet for the other chain and "log in" with my private key. 
Furthermore I read on electrums Manuel's, that the holder itself should be able to decide for a chain/version.

I didn't thought that the holidays of one country could have such a deep impact :/

Kraken and coinbase

Thank you. And where should I store the other coins?
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:29:38
I mean what happens wenn the 21 Million coins are reached 
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:53:30
So could there occur some issues. Can't I just wait as long as I want to do a transaction on the chains to bypass those problems. 
Do you mean it is not save when to much miners update the chain/version and one is open to attack?
