Just update the firmware when setting it up. Trezor should require a firmware update anyway as part of the setup process. 
I wrote a relevant blog post on this. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:32:54
My understanding is that any change to the firmware would change this embedded private key, which means the device would not be able to successfully sign the transaction. Ledger changes this embedded key every set number of batches.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:04:24
That's probably a plus, I like the idea of using my full node to broadcast transactions. Rather than Trezor's server.

Too bad deliveries don't start until December 2014... and the difficulty will be too high by 2015 to make a significant profit. I smell a scam.

I've thought a lot about this idea too, and the one thing that I can't figure out is how to verify that the printout is real and actually contains the designated amount of BTC. This is easy at a merchant with a phone or computer, but what about when you tip the delivery man? The valet? Give your friend some bills? Leave your waiter with a 20? There's no way to verify the bills actually contain anything! An entirely new way to easily counterfeit. Thoughts?
PS this is my first comment in r/bitcoin! Hi everyone!

Are any of these pools based in US? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:32:22

"Whether it’s secure enough, for example. Exchange Mt. Gox had many of its bitcoins stolen several years ago. Last summer, a project running on a blockchain technology similar to bitcoin’s got hacked and lost millions of dollars of investors’ funds."
I think they are saying DAO exploit/theft is similar to Bitcoin? Lol
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:36:27
Very cool. Thanks :) 
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:50:11
Are there fees for exchanging Bitcoin to different currencies on Mobi? How does Mobi handle these conversions, since it is my understanding that funds are still held in Bitcoin on the backend. 
What would happen if all your Mobi users converted their Bitcoin to USD, and then the price of Bitcoin fell by half? How does Mobi handle large swings in Bitcoin price and still maintain liquidity?
Thanks :)

Great question! Right now we cary Ledger Nanos and Trezors. It is pretty impossible for a vendor to compromise either of these hardware wallets. Check out this [support article]( for Ledger, and this [reddit post]( for Trezor (you can verify the firmware, and firmware is flashed by default at setup). These products were designed to be tamper-proof.
Besides that, it can be very beneficial to buy from a third party! Here are some reasons:
1. Our store sells exclusively through OpenBazaar, so buying from us helps OB grow.
2. We buy wholesale from the vendors, so we have some flexibility with pricing. Right now I am pricing our hardware a few dollars less than the MSRP.
3. We are based in the USA, so shipping can be much faster. We do 2-day shipping in the USA.
4. Buying from a store that sells multiple brands is great if you want to get multiple items in one shipment!
Does this make sense? Would love any feedback. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:18:18
Holdly shit this is amazing
@_date: 2016-06-25 02:41:09

hodl your bitcoins with a nice hardware wallet. I just launched [Hodl Hardware Shop](

@_date: 2016-12-28 15:01:13
Not joking, but not saying it will be a "bank" like the traditional bank. I'm thinking really hard about how, once mainstream consumer adoption takes place, people will hodl their coins. Ideally every person would control his/her own keys. But currently too complicated for the mainstream consumer, so we rely on companies like Coinbase that position themselves as "exchanges" rather than banks. 
Ideally I'd like to facilitate the hodling of Bitcoins, but I am trying to figure out if I could do that without controlling (or sharing control) over  customer's keys.
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:59:03
That is really deep and meaningful. Thank you.

Been doing a ton of thinking, I just haven't investigated the regulatory component yet.
Yes, I know that is a huge component, that's why I was asking for more info if I don't issue physical cards.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:50:26
what do you mean? someone stole your Twitter handle?
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:10:25
Thanks so much, really great resources, I will check them out!!
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:38:06
What's cool is that with a Trezor you can have multiple wallets with different pass phrases (an extra layer of security). You can put like 1 btc under 1 passphrase and then put all your rest under a second. If you get held at gunpoint you just give your passphrase with 1btc on it! 
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:50:51
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:17:15
Hmm... my gut says in BTC, but I think it could also be valuable to have a fiat option. Alternatively I could integrate with Coinbase or something for those who need to buy and transfer BTC on the spot. I may also want to tie the BTC amounts to USD to eliminate the volatility issue. 
What do you think?

I think you're right. I was skeptical at first, but then I really thought about whether the data can help them with tax evasion. It cannot.

@_date: 2016-12-28 07:11:05
what if the "credit card" was not an actual credit card, but instead a credit service with bitcoin? and what if savings accounts were purely bitcoin-based? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:28:46
Thanks!! What do you mean by credit card option? I mentioned above that I would give the ability to carry the balance, so it would essentially serve as a credit card (with lower interest rates).
Do you mean having a physical card you can use in-store and pay back over time in BTC?
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:38:40
Agreed. We just lost Boston's only significant Bitcoin company. I will try to start a good one next year.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:05:14
Agreed. We can’t have Bitmain shipping out used hardware. The hardware needs to last longer. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:22:28
ha ha... yea convincing people that bitcoin is the future is really hard. Getting them to appreciate hodling is harder.
@_date: 2016-11-04 02:18:50
I think we can ban them for publishing fake articles, right? Hasn't it been proven that the China news was made up?
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:11:58
I emailed their support. I think this may be a more special case because I already had a business with "Hodl" in the name. Also the account had been idle for years with only 2 followers and no tweets. I used this guide for reference: 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:24:58
I'm at Harvard Business School, where a significant amount of people are in finance. Almost no one is deeply interested in Bitcoin, and only a couple would get the hodl reference.

@_date: 2016-12-29 13:42:05
That's exactly what I meant!
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:48:31
ugh I know...it used to be less, but when I tried to negotiate they ignored me and bumped the price. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:05:44
I was not at all suggesting that I ignore laws – rather I was asking if these exact same licenses apply if I'm not issuing physical credit cards. Obviously legal compliance is crucial to any financial services or bitcoin startup.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:06:19
I never suggested that, I was just genuinely asking if same laws apply when I'm not issuing physical credit cards. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:56:15
I used this guide  
But then I got impatient and contacted Twitter support directly. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:53:54
Thank you for your insightful comment :)
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:35:37
This is very different from btcjam... think of it more as signing up for a credit card, rather than getting a loan from a bank. btcjam is more of a matchmaking platform for loans. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 06:31:20
Hell yes!!!
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:53:08
yes... for the world. I've actually been thinking really hard about what storage for bitcoin will look like when mass adoption takes place. Ideally everyone would hodl their own keys, but we will see. I would say I will facilitate the hodling for my customers :) 
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:05:57
Cool, I'll think about how that could work with the platform 
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:55:31

I was thinking it wouldn't be cards at first - it would start out as purchases in Bitcoin only.

7nm process will have a 4\-5 year lifespan, and the industry is maturing. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:08:24
Of course, I know I have to be in legal compliance. That's not a big deal. I think the banks are built very inefficiently, on very outdated infrastructure. A nimble startup with bitcoin infrastructure could compete really well.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:32:06
It would have to be a very long time, i.e. years, without activity. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:23:09
I'm specifically referring to a few things: IT infrastructure (as in the vast majority have their own servers and aren't using cloud infrastructure  outdated payment networks (have you tried transferring money between financial institutions before?), and physical branches. 
These costs obviously get passed along to the customer.
Operating an online bank, based on bitcoin, would eliminate the need to record transactions (blockchain handles that), would eliminate the need to support payment networks (also blockchain), and would eliminate the need for physical branches. I could pass those substantial cost savings to the customer in some way.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:45:04
No need for you to jump to that conclusion. Still thinking of the best way to do it. Maybe share keys, or give customers a hardware wallet, or something like that. I don't want to just take everyone's keys. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:57:11
I believe Twitter updated their password reset so that you can't see the email domain anymore. At least, this was the problem when I attempted a password reset email.
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:02:14

it's priceless :) 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:20:38
That's a terrible attitude and mentality. We are all users of the financial services industry and it's easy to see shortcomings. And are you typing this on a computer? iPhone? Built by someone else buddy. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:17:04
I am so confused by this. What if you bought btc on another exchange, transferred them to Coinbase, and then sold. Or if you bought on Coinbase and sold on another exchange. It makes it much harder to track for taxation purposes. Going after customer data from Coinbase won't really help from a taxation perspective?
Unless I'm wrong?
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:38:59
I transferred it to my hardware shop 
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:59:09

@_date: 2016-12-28 21:51:32
that sounds fun, but I would be a bit worried about security. also can I see an example? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:03:41
One would have to do all the necessary verifications to predict risk level, and then set interest rates to account for losses.
I totally agree – I don't think Bitcoin startups should just rip off existing business models. However, virtually every financial services company is run pretty inefficiently because it is built on shit infrastructure. Just copying existing overall business models, like "bank" or "insurance" and then building all infrastructure on bitcoin is a massive advantage. 
Also keep in mind that right now, for the average consumer, hodling keys is out of the question. Too complicated.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:53:56
Hilariously enough I did a password reset request for the account but included my  email address as the email to reply. When they emailed me back about the request I then asked for the account.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:33:06
Yes true. But it's small by comparison 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:34:44
I'd have no trouble raising some VC capital, but I'm also considering some sort of crowd sale.

Grab a Trezor or Ledger from [Hodl Hardware Shop](hodl.co) on OpenBazaar. Hardware wallets are the way to go. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 18:17:40
yes, I'd say we were the cause of the jump :)

@_date: 2016-07-18 14:24:29
Same here! I never had the discipline to really save until I started hodling bitcoin. A few months ago I transferred the rest of my savings account into btc! Now I'm magically disciplined :)
