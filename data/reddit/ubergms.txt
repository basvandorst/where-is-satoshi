Stock market died from the moment crypto exchanges opened.
Old people with their old stock picks.
New people with their BTC and Altcoins picks.
Those who fight development will risk stagnation.
Banks will no longer be needed in 20 years.
Everything will be digitalized which is kinda cool.
Wish i would be born again to see the beauty of digital money. With it makes borderless countries.

Be bold and get fucked. But at least you were bold. The quickest way to shithole is trying to grow wealth in under 10 mins. Think of it like growing a tree. It doesn't happen in a week or a month. Patience my friend. �� Stop cumming so quickly. Hold it and enjoy the ride.

Will happen but maybe in 20 years. With BTC futures it will always go down.
Keep the delusion alive.

Haha that comment you need a new gf or get a new parent when btc shoots to the moon. Haha
Bro don't spend only on BTC. Do your research.
Some startups with good project was priced at 
$.0002 then went up to .09 or something over a period of 8-10months. But be careful of the pump and dump.
well btc is pretty solid. it will never die down.
