No, in that case everyone will withdraw their coins

Litecoin actually has faster and cheaper transactions, give it a shot?

Is there a cap on USD in circulation? Should it not have value then? The effect of a cap on crypto, or any type of currency in the world has not been tested. Bitcoin's cap hasn't even come into play yet, I don't think anyone knows if that cap is a good thing or bad thing overall.
Ether is created in every block mined, just like bitcoin.
Edit: Eth's inflation isn't the same as say, USD's inflation. Currency generally inflates by a certain percentage, this does encourage spending and causes it to lose price over time. Eth's inflation is by a constant amount. Imagine if we start from 0, In the first few blocks, that means each block "inflated" total ETH by double digit percents. Billions of blocks later, there is so much ETH that each block has a negligible "inflation" rate. With more ETH there will also be more transactions, and implicit burn, due to ppl misplacing  keys and such. At some point that burn will actually surpass the creation of ETH so the currency is effectively capped.

You can do so on GDAX, with much lower fees.

Was hoping bitcoin would be 90% of that

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
