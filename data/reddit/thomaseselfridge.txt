You should tell everybody! We're mad as hell about bitcoin taxes and we're not going to take it anymore!

Finally real democracy.

Running a node goes against the core of Bitcoin: using _my_ cpu time and network so that _you_ can do your stuff. NOT going to run one until there's a reward that offsets costs (incl my time!).
What does it teach new Bitcoiners when they don't have to pay their own fees? It's attracting freeloaders and I'm sick of it! BITCOIN IS NOT A CHARITY!

Shame he didn't go all in and drop fiat.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:52:04
When will you go Bitcoin only? Imagine life without fees!
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:34:03
The market will figure it out. How about talking to potential sponsors?
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:51:56
I volunteer too, this shit needs a cleansing fire.

What about QR codes in the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-04-24 01:08:48
It's a trap.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:56:28
Just lies from the competition and/or government looking to devalue KnC and Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's destiny is to replace fiat, Silkroad has neither added or taken away from that. Don't be so weak.

The average US wage seems to be slightly more than 44k. If those people took their pay in Bitcoins instead of soon to be dead USD, that'd be $52 billion worth of Bitcoins on Coinbase. WOW!

What if Neil Armstrong had said that? "Eh I'll go when everybody else has already gone, call me when there are strip malls."

When math and faith work together the sky is the limit!
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:42:54
Looks good but a real serious oversight that it doesn't take dollar.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:22:26
Just stop paying. If they try to force you demand to pay in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:20:40
Are we sure that he did? Would be nice to have proof.

Dracula was romainian. Bitcoin drinks the blood of fiat. Makes you think!!!
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:35:41
It's a sign that Bitcoin is too much to handle for some TLAs!
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:35:58
Imagine if Amazon got 9% more sales with Bitcoins, millions upon millions. But they refuse to be part of the future. Stay in the stone age if you want, see how fun it is!

Anything in South America is much better. Or Eastern Europe, they aren't so suffocating.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:12:24
Your weakness is hurting Bitcoin.

Stop being so gullible. If you blindly believe everything people tell you maybe you'd believe the earth is flat.

Gavin's 16GB blocks fixed this.

You think it's bad here? I'm a mod on one of the biggest wow gold forums and r/bitcoin is a paradise in comparison.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:57:22
He's not talking about every single bitcoiner, just the large part of r/bitcoin that's paranoid conspiracy theorists.
