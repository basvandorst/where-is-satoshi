You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, but you also post in ancap. Kinda makes sense after learning that.
You think that stocks will suddenly disappear with a change in what currency is traded? And you still don't seem to understand the concept of compound interest. With ~$715k  in an index fund, you receive an annual return higher than median household income in the US. That is *being wealthy* leading to *more wealth*.

Erm..ever heard of compound interest? Index funds?

Bitcoin takes electricity (primarily nonrenewable as of now), processing power (in high demand, given enterprise usage), and lots of time to process a given transaction. There are trade-offs regardless of what currency you choose to use.

Then regardless of your use of Bitcoin or USD, both can be considered corrupt by that definition. Having wealth leads to earning more, while having none results in a much more difficult climb.

Well, an *investor* implies active portfolio management, not "set and forget" as most people would. For investors, 8% is low, and numbers like 10-12% are sustainable given one doesn't make many mistakes. It's not possible for large corporations simply due to their amount of capital. For an amount in the hundreds of millions, 12% is fantastic. For an amount in the hundreds of thousands, you may have gotten lucky on a single trade.

Some random guy on the internet vs a qualified professional
Yeah, I'll keep taking his information.

And 8% of $1m after taxes is around $90k. Plenty to cover living expenses.
Also, you're probably not an investor, because 8% is something one of my professors deems low. He's a Ph. D. Finance with CFA certs.
