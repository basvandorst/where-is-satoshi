This is amazing!  Looks like they're using Coinbase as their processor.

Just worked for me
@_date: 2013-01-27 02:33:43
I have an Android and use the Coinbase mobile web site, pretty solid
@_date: 2013-02-08 18:11:17
This is awesome.  Simple to use, US based, and backed by well known faces in the tech community... why am I not surprised by this news?

What's a good place other than MtGox for USD?

I use Coinbase's mobile site and it's pretty good
@_date: 2013-01-25 03:15:41
How in the world is charging 7.5% "the cheapest out there".  That's absolutely insane.

This is big... super easy to use, all important actions abstracted in a single API

By leverage, I'm implying that I have a fixed amount of USD and would like the economics of the agreement I enter in to to be greater than 1:1, i.e. if I put down $19 I don't want the economic exposure of 1 BTC ($1 rise and fall in my position for each $1 rise and fall in BTC), I want a $1 rise or fall to mean at least a $3 rise or fall in my position.
Leverage in the traditional sense, as you'd find in the FX markets where 10:1 is commonplace.

I still see the beauty of bitcoin the efficiencies when you stay in the network, but this is a good question to be asking for early adoption
@_date: 2013-02-06 01:02:58
Actually 10 BTC/day, so ~$200/day.  Rises to 100 BTC/day after 30 days of use.  Unfortunately, doesn't help you off the bat.

I can see how it's not perfect right now, but this is the reality of consumer friendly options.  If you think about the early days of PayPal and reversible payment mechanisms, they went through the same thing.
Even if 1% are false positives, given the crazy growth in bitcoin these posts will still crop up, even if they're such a small percentage.

Basic rundown:
Coinbase does secure storage for you by putting your private keys offline, literally in a bank vault, so they never touch the internet and are secure.  They also let you buy/sell on the platform and make it easy to send/receive BTC.
Blockchain doesn't store your private key at all - very cool from a security standpoint but this means you CANNOT lose your password, otherwise there's no recourse.  The buying and selling piece isn't there really - they just let you interface with Bitinstant where the fees are 4% + $3.95 flat fee vs 1% at Coinbase, but if for some reason you want to do cash deposits, that'd be the route.
I prefer Coinbase because I think it's easier to use and the fees are substantially lower.  For those who are security nuts, Blockchain provides a cool setup, but I trust Coinbase enough given their investors so that I don't feel like it's worth my while to worry about losing my password.

Coinbase has had a secondary form of authentication for a while now (kind of surprised BitPay didn't before, seems unsafe) and charges less than half the price...

Completely agree - big opportunity in Canada

3 is the real point.  More than one company is making them so they're going to get out eventually.  Might as well sell them.
@_date: 2013-01-30 20:36:20
I've seen them, but TBH they scare the crap out of me.  69% interest on USD deposits?  Between that and the quality of the site itself, seems like asking for trouble.  I wish I felt otherwise.
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:21:14
Makes sense, and pretty impressive.  I'm still waiting for the day someone has talked to Coinbase and not had a happy resolution.

That's what happens when you have a simple, awesome API
@_date: 2013-02-18 18:16:08
To be clear - this isn't the first app in the store by any means.  I believe Coinbase and blockchain both have apps - the part that hasn't made it to the app store yet is being able to send/receive coins.

"Imagine a company in far future disclosing all their btc addreses so shareholders can be fully informed. I love it."
This wouldn't happen - this would be the equivalent of a bank nowadays simply giving away information of peoples' bank accounts.
