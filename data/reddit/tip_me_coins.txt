$20 Floor™
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:30:22
It's been drifting away from "sending money" to "make money!!!one!!!uno!11!".
When I tell people about bitcoin, the first thing they compare it to is stocks and making money. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:02:19
Holy shit, he sounds like a robot.
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:47:46
All people know is that they will pay $1 for every BFX coin, that's the security. If you don't believe it, sell. If you do, hold. They can't force you to sell. Insider Trading (extremely immoral) wouldn't effect those who expect the $1 buyback. 
^^^^paycoin ^^^^$20 ^^^^floor

OP, are you drunk?
You're literally giving free money and roasting these people to a crisp.
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:01:00
If people are willing to sell their BFX for dirt, Bitfinex should be able to scoop it up. It means it'll cost less to pay back everyone (since it seems like some people want a quick way out), as well as push the price up by buying, I think it helps more than it hurts.

If history rhymes, Poloniex will crash and burn within a year.

6.42% seems a bit high in my opinion, but what price are you purchasing it at?

It's a ponzi scheme. 
It'll disappear in a week or two.

Mix the coins or transfer it around with Monero before paying.
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:00:09
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:11:05
Nah, I'm good. 
Have a good one OP. :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:34:10
No, I'm not.
Why are you suggesting that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:46:27
I believe the transaction will be dropped after a certain amount of time (Not sure how long), if you want it to go through, double spend it with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:24:45
Bitcoin will never be a currency if people only use it to hold until they can sell at a higher price. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:24:39
The lightning network won't solve the issues of the common non-technical coinbase user only trying to flip a quick buck.
It's not about one coin being better than another anymore, it's about the people buying coins aren't even fucking using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:07:16
It's valuable when you when the holders have a reason to use it, not just hold it.

It's as if, it works the way it was suppose to!

It's unfortunate opinions are the bane of your existence, though. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:50:25
$125 to put some pretty pictures and text together is pretty good in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:10:11
You purchased a beer and a ham sandwich. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:11:59


My opinion, as in, the opinions of myself. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:44:33
Your friend wanted some bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:42:42
Probably not.

The director of the video is here :
Tweet him to update it!
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:15:04
But he hasn't lost a single coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:06:25
Kinda like what said last year.
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:51:02
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't see anything wrong with that. It's his exchange, he's not going to trade on the exchanges of competitors. If he does exchange on other exchanges, there will be posts about how he doesn't believe in his own exchange and more bullshit.
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:07:14
It was through his wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:24:11
"Calm down"
lololol. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:01:27
These are nodes, not miners. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:20:49
Probably won't happen as there needs to be something to be charged in case there is an accident in the vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:19:01
Can't really anticipate the costs of what you break/damage. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:34:35
About 3/4 now. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:37:02
    Isn't it awesome that Bitcoin evolved in to a totally decentralized system where one giant piece of shit makes virtually all the mining chips? /s
Bitmain should not be at fault for operating within free market. If there are no competitors, Bitmain is obviously able to have majority of the market. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:28:22
He's been gone for years. 
Even if he did come back, so what? It can run without him and his return will only cause greater centralization.  
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:42:24
Unless you're willing to throw in a few hundred thousand dollars or even millions, don't expect much of a return when buying miners. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:38:50
Is double spending not considered counterfeiting? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:17:37
Yes, it's cheaper and faster than if it were to be on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:04:37
So, you do agree?

1. Encrypt wallet/private key.   
2. Put the wallet/private key into a bank/directly to your loved ones possession. (Explain to them first)
3. Dead man's switch the key to unlock it.   
4. Die.   
5. Assets from bank should be given to them during the process. (lmao)   
6. They unlock the wallet with the key. 
An attacker would only have the key to unlock and never the encrypted files.

It's true, this happens all the time and is a graphical glitch on gdax.

The amount of BTC owed should be said in how many bitcoins owed. Agree on a fair amount near 35$ worth. Let's say .14 BTC, pay it as soon as possible to make sure value doesn't change much.

Don't mean to be a downer dan here, but GAW didn't make this... There's another group called Team XPY that made this, they aren't GAW.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:05:42
I doubt they generated "Btc" along with it as well. Wouldn't have taken long for them to just generated "PoLe" though.

@_date: 2016-07-26 06:56:34
I think the issue with that would be having an attacker gain access to the google account and having access to all the 2fa codes. 2fa is the physical Plan B that can only be taken from your phone in case someone has access to your password and is able to reset your accounts. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:50:31
Can confirm, I have lost a wallet with a lot more than 1 bitcoin. :(
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:35:48
Discord allows one time codes that bypasses their 2fa.

Gold isn't only for jewellery and circuits. The majority of gold is used to store wealth as it doesn't mix with other metals, there isn't a real value other than it's safe to keep, a limited amount, and everyone agrees it has value. Bitcoin is the same, it doesn't mix with other stuff, it's safe to keep, there's a controlled supply, and people have agreed on a price.
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:46:36
I think this might be what you're looking for?
@_date: 2016-07-12 07:36:39
How do you remember usernames like that?
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:56:27
Bleach each and every individual key after creating it so oil from the human finger cannot be traced to extract the keys.

His character would be centralized. If he was public, and known, his voice and opinion would have a lot of weight and would probably split communities. That's why some people are glad he left, as his word is extremely significant. 
Also, the fact that he might own a million coins makes it seem a little centralized. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:49:04
Huh, that's stupid.
The actual account would definitely be the most important to protect. Thanks for the reply. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 07:12:32
I lost a fuckload. I jumped on board when they were 20-30 cents each. I was never into security and owning my own wallet back then so I used blockchain.info, I forgot the password and wallet identifer. 
I could have been a hundred-thousandnaire.
@_date: 2016-07-06 01:00:37
Don't say "dox".
It's more of, "this fucking asshole stole $200,000 from me".
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:21:07
Ahhh no! Foiled once again!
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:34:35
Wouldn't you need to use 2fa to login before you can turn it off with the password? Or do they reset the 2fa without logging in with the user/pass?
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:35:01
It's pretty stupid too, the Nobel Prize is awarded to celebrate the achievements and what the person has done, not the person.
