What are you smoking?
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:59:59
The key word you said was "idk" you don't know, this isn't to bash you but you clearly don't know what you're investing in, you should really look into the technology and see if it's something you understand and want to stick in, I'd recommend to only hold onto your coins if you don't need the money desperately, only invest what you're willing to lose.

Which would be very hard for them.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:04:25
thank you
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:26:04
Probably user error. Blockchain is a well known reputable wallet
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:37:11
well, it all depends on how you look at things, it wasn't a good time to buy at the time, but i think in a few years time people that bought at 18k in 2017 will be kicking themselves for not buying more... all in hindsight
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:16:04
they can
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:01:14
very nice
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:24:50
Why are they cutting the rates in the first place? Sorry if that seems like a stupid question
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:26:27
When someone says "your BTC is very safe" chances are, it's not
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:53:10

@_date: 2019-07-20 23:30:16
Just buy the bitcoin and hodl
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:53:45

@_date: 2019-07-24 15:07:20
where did you have your coins stored? on an exchange?
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:36:01
Lol... didn't he want to de-value the "strongest" currency ever like last week?
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:24:54
Love it

What is the time traveller story?
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:10:57
you only lose when you sell
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:20:22
Ask yourself, why does he even need you? He can do this all himself... this is a massive scam,and if you don't listen to us you'll be crying to everyone after complaining
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:38:15
I have more.
@_date: 2019-11-16 19:15:28
Did you wake up thinking u fast forwarded in time and bitcoins the new norm? Lol
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:34:35
Limit it to only 21m people
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:55:02
And this has what relevance to bitcoin?????
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:02:00
Bitcoin will be the least of our worries if the internet goes out
@_date: 2019-08-10 06:11:19
Higher, what's the best way

You sent him your receive address not send address right?
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:15:35
Once you feel your investment is significant enough and you don't want to risk losing it, invest in a hardware wallet to securely store your coins. I'd recommend ledger nano s or trezor
@_date: 2019-08-10 08:28:56
Don't be so paranoid your whole life�� im asking a simple question, I know the person personally so relax
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:23:14
Giving up your life is not worth it, you have to get up and fight harder. Not sure what else I can say, good luck and please don't give up
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:24:02
What Im curious about is if the dollar crashes (and other worldwide currencies) what would 1 bitcoin be priced against? How will we know a true value of a bitcoin? Im bullish on BTC FYI
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:08:21
Don't worry mate we have all been there, just focus now to make that money back. Stressing out and depressing yourself (which might not happen to you)
Focus on building yourself back
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:58:43
Wish you the best
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:39:39
I know you don't want to beg but other people have been in worse situations and they have got back up. You can too
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:29:23
No begging on this sub
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:04:44
There's always more money around. Trillions in the stock market, crypto market cap is only a few hundred billion
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:51:50
Yes, you can buy $1000 dollars worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:39:29
This nutter
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:55:28
why even bother paying taxes?
@_date: 2019-10-18 08:02:44
wow lol
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:50:23
has anyone got an answer to how this was actually hacked? im very curious
@_date: 2019-10-18 08:04:14
you done your part by telling them about btc and the opportunity, but if they don't listen don't beat a dead horse. just wait and they will come back when the price increases.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:32:59
Just try and figure a way to manage this problem, try and stay strong and focus on overcoming it
@_date: 2019-10-21 08:09:45
because Stone Cold said so
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:08:57
How much did you give in total

sell it through coinbase, normally it can land in your account the same day
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:12:24
pls dont kill yourself
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:32:02
No one can really tell you as I'm sure you already know, bitcoin is a really long term thing to see incredible results, but it is possible bitcoin can spike up as you've probably seen the last few days. Do what your gut says but make sure you accept if you sell now it might go higher, as long as you can accept it then sell. I personally would hodl unless you are in desperate need of the cash

OK IRS
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:48:35
coinbase will transfer it to your bank once you sell the coins to them
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:30:52
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:51:28
I think you should sell what you have on robinhood and rebuy the actual bitcoin asset
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:49:23
HODL and keep educating yourself
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:34:11
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:29:35
Crazy manipulation. Some people are making some serious $$$$
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:01:30
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:08:26
It's always better to buy the underlying asset so you have control
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:01:07
Sell, buy back in at 25000
@_date: 2019-12-31 11:22:17
Good luck
@_date: 2019-12-11 08:20:27
I think you should sell as you either don't know what bitcoin is or you're just holding too much of it
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:53:27
They can only access the cryptocurrency within the device if the person has your 24 word seed (you mentioned you took a picture of the 24 words) I don't know how someone got the 24 words from you but I assume it must be someone who accessed your phone or maybe a Google employee. The 24 words are not just for the ledger device, if you store your crypto on a ledger using 24 word seed, I can access your crypto with the 24 word seed using any bitcoin wallet (as far as I know, someone please correct me if I'm wrong)
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:19:42
It is 'soccer' but we call it football, sorry for the confusion
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:15:45
ledger is not the issue, the issue is that you took a picture of your 24 words. 
the 24 word seed is only what is required to steal your funds, nothing else, i can assure you of that. the 24 words aren't built only for ledger devices.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:08:22
You made the mistake as soon as you took a pic of the 24 words. They don't need a ledger nano S to steal your funds btw, they only needed the 24 words.
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:43:03
moving it to a hardware wallet e.g. ledger nano s or trezor is safe, coinbase isn't safe at all even if you have 2fa. its always best to spend $60 on a hardware wallet. better be safe than sorry
