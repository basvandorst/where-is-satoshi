A combination of all three of your methods will be more efficient.
Thanks for this data!

Hmmm the transaction fee is wrong. Some chatter on Reddit was saying how it's actually an 'administrative fee', but confusingly labelled as a transaction fee.

Judges are part of government. They are not part of your life unless government takes notice of you. Money is what you think it is, and what you agree to use for money with the person you barter with. Even the constitutions of countries where gold and silver are described as money, describe how the government defines money. This is THEIR definition. You accept it or you don't.

Its pretty good that they arent potraying btc as something for criminals like back in the day.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:31:33

good luck finding a girl, who will like your lots of bitcoint

Well you sure took a lot of time looking for 10 bad things to say about bitcoins. We can post post a lot of shit about anything other than bitcoin, without searching to long. 
Nobody says, bitcoin is perfect, but for a young currency, it's doing pretty good, in comparison with other commodities.

Great idea! Looking forward to see the reactions of many people on it on April 1st

He is just going to make an appearance that he is listening to!
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:22:06
Of course the banks want to prevent people from transacting in BTC because they can't extract the value out of it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:52:48
Other than that, it looks like a pretty decent site. Now, then again, I'm not one to judge websites, so take my opinion with a gain of salt. I still have yet to learn that skill.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:28:56
Mysteries aren't supposed to be uncovered. So regardless of the facts presented it's a selling point for any mystery to stay as is.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:03:01
Awful news, but it proves once again that it's better not to keep btc in exchanges
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:28:33
BTC ATM's are popping up everywhere. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:45:46
Jail or cause it's cool 
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:04:04
My only opinion would be to not invest more into btc (more than you can afford) and just ride the train now to 2015. Good luck with your btc savings.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:46:22
wow! That's amazing! I didn't even think we've got so many restaurant in our btc world ))

bitcoin is perfect for norp
anonymous and secure, no charge backs from those regretting that masturbation session they told themselves not to do
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:34:46
It could very well turn out to be the worst in terms of price per BTC, but it is still one of the best in the development of all the possibilities that bitcoin brings to the table. All the advances will still lead to long term gains, i am very confident.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:07:03
well, as history is telling that everything needs time so bitcoin is also needs time to fix every bugs but I am sure it will never break down
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:37:30
A bit late to the party, but good try nonetheless 
Do you have any kind of specification you can share ? 
Especially, how are you generating keys ? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:29:16
This is all a step in the right direction I have to admit. I can imagine there are a lot of people who wish to pay for their coffee or any other kind of food or drink using bitcoins and having an option like this available even if it's only a few places will at least start it off to see how it goes. I personally myself would love to pay for something as small as coffee with bitcoins so having that option would be great for me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:21:35
It makes me sick, can they say something that have any sense?
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:53:14
It was easy to buy small amounts on Gox without going through AML/KYC back then. I think the limit for unverified accounts was around $1000 USD/day.

I just heard Bangladesh has signed up with Bitcoin. cant wait for an ATM

Turning point what a fuzzy phrase! it can mean whatever one likes
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:56:42
Pretty good news considering Dell are known for good quality (ish) computers and I will always accept a discount when paying for Bitcoin! Great stuff. I know where the majority of Bitcoiners will be getting their new computers this year.

I suspect he's not really holding BTC

European Banks are in big trouble and usually the last resort is debasement of the currency.  You very well could see Wiemar-like hyperinflation.
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:03:14
Surely AirBaltic actually mean administrative fee, as by paying Credit Card for instance will likely incur what most would be familiar with as a transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:12:11
i don't really know. i just hope satoshi isn't a greedy guy and doesn't care about the money.. and decided to see what his donating money for certain causes would or could change the world.
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:01:54
I want you to bust the myth that bitcoin and the necessary technologies are ready for ordinary people to hold and use.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:34:25
lol although it's bad to see bitcoin used in a negative way to promote growth.
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:03:18
If they re-worded it across all options then it likely wouldn't seem so bad. Anyway, the fee amount stands.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:29:46
There's a speculation thread for a reason.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:25:20
I've heard Thai legalized btc not long ago and they already have places like this accepting bitcoin, very progressive!
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:28:01
look like the trend is picking up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:10:15
it's only words, nothing concrete. I'm sure,it means we don't know what to say but we have to say something
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:46:31
It could be a great strategic move to start endorsing it with top professionalism.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:47:01
I will seriously name my baby Satoshi for 10 bitcoins. It was a great name. My son would not regret it. I will give him the 10 bitcoins once he is old enough to use it.
