Can anyone speak to the computational cost associated with keeping bitcoins secure? Some figures point to close to 11 million dollars / day in electricity cost in mining.
I know this "keeps the network secure" and "is less than most fiat banking systems", but the way mining is motivated in the bitcoin system is less about competing against outside attackers and more about the relative price of earned bitcoins / price of electricity.
It seems to me like bitcoin was developed as a neat example of a cytopgraphically secure currency, since it was planned by a cryptographer. I don't see how the bitcoin protocol is necessarily at the pareto optimum of
* environmental impact
* cryptographic security
* ease of use (including privacy concerns)
* and economic benefit. 
Since a large part of bitcoin's value is based the speculation that it will succeed, I could see the development of a competing system which better optimizes the above points to be a huge blow to bitcoin - not because the new system would necessarily be the successor to bitcoin - but because it would reveal flaws in the bitcoin system that would pop the heavily optimistic view that bitcoin will forever reign supreme as the world's digital reserve currency.

Great point. Miners compete with other miners for the money, with the payout determined ahead of time to be (25 BTC / block) * (6 blocks / hour). This essentially creates an industry in burning electricity for bitcoins with no controls on how much security is actually needed.
I'm still confused as to why the blocks/mining concept is regarded as the only answer to maintaining robustness in the network. Surely there are alternative schemes to reach population consensus on transaction history that are computationally more efficient - I simply think that until a competing system is developed that proves this, this point will be largely ignored.
