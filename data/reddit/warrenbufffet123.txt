Hello ,
         Great job , I like your app . Can the dashboard display my total fiat activity(fiat_activity tab) which would be my original cost basis  ? It would be easy to then compare my original investment and current value(current portfolio value) on the same page , love to see that feature .
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:35:45
Well I see M and M on both sides of 17 &amp; 58 maybe its MOON back then :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:54:11
lol true :-) But I hope they were not like 10,000 or 20,000 bit coins , that would be lot of money !
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:25:40

0 - Zero dollars ! If you don't have a hardware wallet yet better keep it on exchange until you get one. Buy Ledger nano s -easy to use and has great support team . I bought 2 of them .

You are very optimistic bro :-) , let see if china or korea could pump it .
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:21:30

@_date: 2017-11-23 16:34:12

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:49:51
