This is pretty big. I just walked into the Doctors and Sky News were doing a piece on it on TV, interviewing people in a store.

Yeah I used this, very easy, quick bank transfer.

Oh I don't doubt it, although I still think he comes across as a bit of a dick, at least to me.
The problem is any and all dickish behaviour or wrongdoing seems to fall under this character assassination umbrella when that's clearly not the case. Not saying he's a traitorous rapist scumbag but he's certainly no saint either, sadly most people just seem to be in one absolute camp or the other.

Roger Ver is good people.

Wow, that's incredible. He's probably changed a life there.
I was watching Louis Theroux yesterday and he was in Vegas with gamblers, and these people were spending crazy amounts. One guy, cigar in mouth was dropping like 10000 a spin on roulette, like 'I can afford it, it's entertainment'. That's life changing money and with a 20 second spin and shrug of the shoulders it's gone.
Not that rich people should give money to the less well off, if you've earned your money then you deserve to as you wish with it, but if he's getting enjoyment out of gambling those amounts, imagine how much enjoyment and just warmth he'd get say donating 10000 to a shelter and meeting everyone there, or paying for a persons groceries at a checkout which would be less than pennies for him, but would make someones day.
I bet once you start feeling that shit it'd be like human love crack, way more addicting than gambling.
I guess its alot easier to say when you're poor, but I'd definitely be running around making people and myself feel the warm fuzzies.

A while to go for me, I bought in at 800. :/
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:05:17
Holy shit. Good on him for getting away in profit.

The visa regulations have just changed btw, no more border runs for visa exemption extensions, flights changing shortly too. Alot of stranded tourists recently. Of course if you get the proper visas then you're good.
I envy you, not because of the trip, but because of your backup money and skills. Im moving out there in 3 weeks with just $3500 and a backpack, no job, no skills, hoping to figure it out when I'm there, maybe get a TEFL job or bar work. Computer quals/skills and you're golden, can work from anywhere so you'll be fine. Hope it goes well for you mate, maybe we'll cross paths at some point!

You know what'd be cool as fuck? Gaming for bitcoins.
I just thought to myself, 'Damn, I have no real talent or idea to contribute there.. 0.05 is alot.. :/.. I'd kick anyones ass on Tekken for it though'.
Imagine deathmatches, fights, fifa games, hi-score battles.. all bet/paid/involving Bitcoin.
Actually the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of challenges or battles. A subreddit 'bitcoinbattles' or something, where you could challenge one another for Bitcoins. Whether its at singing, gaming, drawing, whatever.

Cheers, posted there too.

 Chiang Mai is a beautiful place, great vibe, easily my favourite city in Thailand.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:35:44
On a larger scale, yeah, although I was thinking of just a subreddit really, pretty casual and community driven.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:51:26
That'd be awesome actually, live betting on twitch!
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:24:46
This. It needs to be more accessible and simplified for the average person.
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:50:07
The mods should remove the same topics. Maybe ban the dipshits posting them. Surely you can see 5+ hash/overstock threads sitting at the top of the damn subreddit, why the fuck would you post it again?
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:05:52
Wait, Liveleak is Ogrish? I had no idea. Haven't been on Ogrish for years, except the forums once in a blue moon, but often get linked to Liveleak.

From the little I've read/watched he seems like a bit of a dick.
I don't think I'll ever see him as anything other than a narcissitic douche personally but it takes nothing away from the good he's done.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:59:30
Welcome, I did the same. :)
Actually I bought 0.03, then found justdice and lost it all. :/
Rebought 0.05 last week at 780 and started watching the price rise, did the same on about 914 while it was flying up.
I spent 50 pounds in total for 0.1, now its worth 60 and I feel like a wall street trader. Fuck yeah.

But not everybody is looking to invest. As a currency most people want to pay for things quickly and easily with less fees than a credit card or whatever.
I looked into it to buy stuff, not to fuck about with exchange rates and markets and whathaveyou.
You have a valid point regarding investing, but sadly it seems Bitcoins potential and massive strength as usable currency is overshadowed by people trying to make a buck.
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:02:52
Recently went, way way cheaper than $200.

I agree with what you're saying but there's a difference IMO. If your PC is fucked or slow then you need to fix it and therefore need to put the effort in to learn how. Same with cars and whatever else.
But there's no need to learn about the intricacies of Bitcoin really. Yes, it might help you understand it better but if all you want to do is send/receive money then unless you want to, you shouldn't have to.
It's like delving into economics if you have a bank account.
In a perfect world eveybody would love to learn all about everything but alot of people just can't be bothered or are not interested. Not a bad thing either, people are people, but in the case of Bitcoin I feel the complexity (at least the seeming complex, because after going through it all it was fairly simple, just longwinded) is a bit of a barrier to the ultimate goal of a simple, easy to use currency.
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:23:12
Definitely this. I heard about Bitcoin a year or two ago, through reddit and as it was linked to Silkroad.
Thought I'd deposit a little and play round but as soon as I looked into it, it was all blockchain this, encryption that, mining, gpu, and all kinds of nerdy looking bullshit I couldn't be bothered to get into. 
I'm kicking myself now, but for the average joe whos not deep into the internet or computers, the technical jargon and seemingly complex everything are massively offputting.
For instance, I still don't have a clue what mining is, or a blockchain, any of that stuff. I figured out how to make a wallet and how to deposit money, that's it, and that's all the average person needs. If it's simple to do this and easily explained then people will jump on board.

Don't let the fact it's in the conspiracy sub put you off, jump in and have a read, all the sources are there, pretty legit stuff. I read it one day and spent like a week just investigating further and reading up. The book on The Franklin case is a good read for sure.
Also bear in mind this was posted before any of the UK stuff with MPs and child rape/murder came to light.

They do this in Thailand, very common among groups of women. My girlfriend actually does it with her mum and a few friends from her area. She cashed out at the end and made a tidy profit recently, apparently pretty much everyone else took money early. I think it ran for like 6 months or something. Illegal too as far as I know.
I still don't understand it though, she's tried explaining it to me so many times but my brain doesn't get it.
Also, it's not unusual to hear about people running off with all the money.
Found an explanation:
