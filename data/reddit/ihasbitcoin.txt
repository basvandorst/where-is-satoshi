I feel lucky today, because it taught me to save money and have it for when i need it... and i do. Financial security is very satisfying, even if it's not 100s of thousands or millions. The majority of society(at least in America) live "hand to mouth" and after 10 years of working a job have barely anything to show for. If you have to work for it, you respect having it much more than if it's just given to you(especially at a young age).

Are you a bitcoining farm hand? and just thought, "awe what the heck"?

Damn, I wish so bad that he would've been able to be the one who spoke at the money20/20 event. I always enjoy listening to him just as a speaker, even if the topic wasn't about bitcoin.

I say, that would be the only use of a mining pool to be over the 50 percent mark.... so they could conduct a couple unauthorized transactions to recover those lost bitcoins.... sadly something like that would never go over well.

Well that's awesome, i'm all about educating everyone about bitcoin. It's good to learn concepts of things such as bitcoin when you're young... Things have the most effect on a person at a young age.

Give me 15 minutes and i can read you some scripture.

No i haven't... i will. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:43:59
yep just like me... i can't handle it so i complain wherever i can.
@_date: 2014-11-01 08:55:32
Well i'm not sure... it's been only been about a year since it went mainstream i guess. The internet sure helps things spread like wildfire. The public portrayal of bitcoin isn't so pretty though.

I'm pretty sure i lured people to my post by the title, letting them think it was going to be encouraging.... then i just pissed em off(hence dislikes).

I never got an allowance as a kid... if i wanted money I had to ask my dad what job i could for him to make a little something.
I always ended up mowing the lawn or something of that sort. Even when i wasn't old enough to mow the lawn id go out and pick up English walnuts  for 2 cents a piece.

All you down voters... am i wrong?
