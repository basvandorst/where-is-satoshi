you are in the wrong subreddit for asking questions, 99% of people in here a cunts. This should really be called @_date: 2014-02-25 13:05:36
A thief now owns them.

Are all exchanges run by 15 year olds ?

Your post made me laugh out loud like an idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:21:52
here is the one I was talking about.
I would not touch Bitcoins if you paid me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:16:24
I bought in at $1200 then $800 and then again at $700. $300 is not really a concern for me and I will probably buy another $100 worth a week until I have spent $1000. Gambling is gambling and I would rather gamble on something revolutionary like bitcoin than the horses,casino games, football, boxing or any other type of gambling in exsistence.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:29:05
what the fuck. That seems to defeat the purpose of having bitcoin as a currency if you cannot withdraw it :/
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:10:08
Happy Holidays to you too!

Asking questions relating to bitcoin on the biggest bitcoin subreddit is the wrong way to go about acquiring information ? Obviously I am using reddit incorrectly.
Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:22:23
Would you like it ? I am selling it for 50 Bitcoins :P

Thank you for the input Master Economist.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:21:09
here is one theft.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:05:54
So the chart is wrong and basically useless and the real price of a coin is mtgox ?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:23:47
oh, I see how it works now. I was on the bitstamp market.
One more question. It seems every exchange is reporting a different bitcoin price, what is stopping someone flipping coins for profit ?

You must be exhausted, I hope this reply does not make you pass out from eye strain.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:23:04
To the potato!
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:29:48
That was when someone stole $500,000 worth of coins from another person right ? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:17:37
Because the banks of the world are releasing media reports stating bitcoin is basically garbage so they can retain the power of using money as debt.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:20:37
Wow, 2 hours ago. Shit is getting crazy.
Not what I was looking for, but I will find it and show you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:41:08
Wow a 3 million dollar scam. That's crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:58:39
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:58:43


What is wrong with mtgox ?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:42:18
So all the people seeing this who bought in over $600 are about to fucking panic *BOOM*
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:46:24
TO THE ~~MOON~~ DIRT!!
