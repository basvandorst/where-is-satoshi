Yes but if enough people sell their BTC for USDT and then USDT value vanishes into thin air that's a big chunk of overall value that just got erased from the crypto community as a whole and now there's less money to buy your BTC and everyone else's so less BTC gets bought overall and now there's more supply than the demand is able to meet and the price of BTC lowers to match.
Also, let's say you buy 1 BTC today for 10,500 USDT and then tomorrow USDT drops to .50USD/USDT. Well then, in a way that BTC was only sold for 5,250 USD and the price drops.

The captain of the Titanic guaranteed us that every person on board the ship is backed 1:1 with a spot on a lifeboat in case the ship sinks. If it crashes, just swap your cabin bed for a lifeboat seat and ride out the waves and we'll all survive. I promise, we have enough lifeboat seats for everyone. Trust me, I run the biggest exchange on the market... I mean I captain the biggest ship in the ocean.

Someone would have to make a system that would make it impossible to make a withdrawal of any amount without getting peer review acceptance from a number of other account members that're randomly chosen from the entire pool of users that get to look at the account history of the person attempting to withdrawal, maybe with everyone involved including the one attempting a withdrawal's name and personal info unavailable to view so noone knows who eachother are. The ones doing the reviewing would just be able to see the deposit/withdrawal info of the account in question along with how much they're attempting to withdrawal and would say yes it's legit or no it's not and you need like 7/10 or 35/50 to say your withdrawal is legit or not before you get your money. Obviously you'd have to work out things like the person that writes the code could just turn the review system off and exit scam, maybe have it so the person who writes the code gets 50% of the interest and the person who runs the bank account and knows it's information gets the other 50% of interest and they never meet or talk to or even know eachother somehow. You'd also have to account for trolls that would just reject everyone, maybe make the peer review group for only the top 10% of wealth holders using the account and make punishment for abusing the system and just trolling everyone steep like you lose 10% of your total wealth and are kicked from the account. Idk just spitballing a hypothetical idea.

Mmmm, ok I see what you're trying to get at but I think you're wrong. Different cryptos are like different world currencies, if China prints more Yen that doesn't mean there's more dollar bills in the world. In fact, bitcoin is more limited than world currencies. once the last BTC is mined, that's it. if the US needs more dollars, they just print more. After all, remember fiat currencies are simply a bunch of ink dyes on pieces of paper of which the supply is near infinite.

You're saying I should swap all my USDT to BCC yes?
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:32:53
So are the splitting the same amount of total coins available then?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:23:33
Do you know how they take the old bills out of circulation? Shredding them? Burning them? Big red stamp that says VOID, lol? Also, have they ever done replacement minting with any coins or are all the new ones just minted to be added into circulation on their own?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:37:56
Is there a possible consumer fraud case that could be started from all this?

That's not where they're located just where they established the company, for tax purposes.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:25:23
Maybe they're printing more BTC rofl
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:36:39
yes that's true but i think it's also important to realize that Bcash steal brand name of bitcoin too..

So the wallets can't be owned by Bitfinex higher ups in on the scams? Obviously you wouldn't hold all of your fraud coins in your own personal wallet on your own exchange you's spread it out to many different wallets on many exchanges so it appears they're all real people. They might be criminals but i don't think they're stupid enough to hold a billion USDT in a bitfinex wallet named N0thing_2_C_here_LMAO
