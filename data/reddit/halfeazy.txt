@_date: 2019-07-22 18:32:41
you dont think u will be able to buy btc at $8000 again?
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:04:34
why wouldnt you want to buy btc in two years? it will be $3,000 then
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:59:00

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:27:20
Lmaoo. I was there in 2013 when it went from $1000 to $250....You havent seen anything yet my friend
Btw its down 4% in the last hour and 9% since yesterday
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:08:05
something is always bound to happen
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:21:43
i never said i was comparing stocks with the same market camp. that is only you and the guy before you.
I was simply comparing that stocks move like that everyday. the first response i got was “no, it does not.”
so as you can see “yes, it does” but now you guys r shifting the argument. good luck
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:32
lmfao $11700 dip on bittrex
you think an exchange breaking can be good?
 they just dont wanna execute losing orders
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:55:06
I am not rich, and no
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:38:04
lmao found the guy who bought yesterday
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:25
maybe they didnt wanna process sell orders at $13,600 when bitcoin was suddenly selling for $11,700
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:46:28
Those are all from today. I threw that bitcoin one in there, BTCS, which was up 60%.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:23:21
did you see, my proof?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:31:34
so you dont know why it had such weak movement with such high volume? I bought btc at $25
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:41:45
yes, market cap usually around 20 mil
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:48:07
your rebuttal is irrelevant to the 20% gains in the stock market that the other guy said didnt happen. let me ask you, what was the vol of bitcoin traded yesterday on dollars?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:28:21
it happened in one min tbh
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:03:21
it really depends on the volume being traded. sometimes the $ amount that gets traded is 5x total float.
The earlier user was telling me that “it doesnt happen”
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:58:06
so less then 25% of its full cap. I used small marketcap stocks because thats what moves like that, and that was the point I was making.
20%+ moves happen everyday in the stock market
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:27:34
yea. you said that its easier for smaller cap stocks to move like that. why did they have the same type of gains as btc with a lower percentage in volume? you are way to dickhard about marketcap. btc market cap fluctuates so much because of the price.
I get ur mad that is at $10,500 and gonna crack hard but take a breath dude
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:37:22
yes, it does.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:22:54
np at al, literally screenshotted the first few from my watch list
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:27:13
its a 20% move.... that happens every day in the stock market
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:07:01
thats irrelevant. we are talking percentages, i can show u stock that go from $1-$20 whats the difference besides the big number
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:00:59
Its above $7000 dood
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:01:16
bitcoin is at $7300 tho
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:42:35
“I have a whole bitcoin and it only cost me $13,000!”
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:45:10
lmao im only holding like .15 btc and I purchased 2 for $50
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:56:24
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:12:10
why? bitcoin would have to be like $8600 for u to make twenty bucks
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:42:58
lmao wtf does that mean
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:38:12
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:09:18
lmao wtf. People like this are the reason credit cards charge such a high APR. Why would u invest money that isn’t yours?
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:57:24
put the /s then my guy
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:54:07
damnnn u just turned that guy into swiss cheese
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:47:05
This guys said there was no sign of the wall.
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:02:46
bought at 12.5k?
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:53:43
Ill take it. will you send first to a trusted buyer and seller. i have done deals on and have a long lost of feedback on ebay
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:42:32
yea ok
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:31:21
ive been in btc since $25 and im holding stocks plus silver and gold
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:31:52
thats a foolish statement. everything trades in terms of btc, btc is king
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:06:36
yea but they r currently being bought and sold for prices much higher the. that
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:44:13
this post is all over the place
@_date: 2018-12-27 14:32:57
maybe invest in an older reddit account, so when you troll you dont look like an idiot
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:08:54
The market is just going thru a real correction, not a bitcoin “correction”. BTC is worth less then 25% of its all time high while most stock indexes are within 20% of recent posted all time highs
