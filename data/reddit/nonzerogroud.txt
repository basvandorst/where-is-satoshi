This doesn't work too well. Multiple queries to convert BTC to USD returned $0.00.

I don't understand. Was there a split? Does Bcash have anything to do with the whole debate over Segwit2x etc...?

Correct. Is the conversion really my biggest problem? Kraken for example will take $20 for each bankwire. If I'm buying 1BTC at a time, that already puts me close to the commission I'm paying today.

cex.io seems like it will cost more than what I pay now.

Thanks for the tip. But this has nothing to do with the price going up, but rather the commission you (or precisely, I) pay above the market price.

I don't understand two things: 
1. Is *this* the fork that everyone was talking about circa August? AKA Bitman vs BIP148? Or is it a different one? 
2. So if I had 3 BTC before the split, I now have 3 BTC, and how many BCH? and if I sell my BCH, what happens to my BTC?

Would have loved to buy the dip...
(It doesn't make sense for me to open a Kraken account (for example) because wire transfer fees etc...will offset savings)

Nope. But I appreciate your effort.

That's the exchange I talk about in my OP.

Thank you. Never got your DM.

Thank you. I'm the OP. it says transaction fee too low. I can't believe they set it to 1 satoshi/byte...

Interesting. Was never aware of this. Does Coinbase have any rights to do this? Why would they ban trading?
Also: all recommended methods/services listed here are hardware based (breadwallet, which I just downloaded) — are these *more* secure than online wallets? are there any online wallets that are both reliable, private, and let me choose who I transfer money to?
