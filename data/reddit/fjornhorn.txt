The fee is too low. The miners decide when they include a transaction and your limit is set too low. Some pools include low transactions or even no-transaction TX, but you seem to be in bad luck. You included 0.00000001 BTC. That's far from the default (minimum) 0.0001 BTC (1/10,000th of a BTC = about 0.06 USD). 
To prevent spamming of the network the minimal TX fee is 0.0001 at the moment.

Thanks for the tip! 
A RipeMD-160-Hash (address) has 160 bits, a private ECDSA key has 256 bits, so by the pigeonhole principle there should be 2^96 private keys for each Bitcoin address.

Just realised how unfair this all probably is. All these early adopters have 100s or 1000s of Bitcoin, and the avarage person on earth would never own a full Bitcoin if the adoption and price goes up like it did.

This helped me once: Try looking back in your email to the date you where you set the password. What music you listened to, food you ate, location, etc, etc. Try to re-create the day you set the password. Sometimes this unlocks things. 
Your password is still in there *taps head* you just need to access the pathway in your brain.
After that, try hypnosis.

Had to look it up, but yes, backing up your wallet.dat is ok up to 100 Transactions into the future.
Exceptions are if you **import** a key. The backup won't be valid for that import.
TLDR; Backup your wallet to offsite media (CD/USB):
* Once every 100 transactions
* Once you import a privatekey from paper wallet

A lot of miners just dump on market because they want USD. A lot of coins are sold every day just because of minig. Combined with The Boring Phase we are in and China ban: We are going down (my guess).
Only when things calm down, and maybe at the next halving, are we going up.

* Take your brainwallet phrase.
* Obfuscate is by doing 100 million rounds of SHA hashing

No. The more miners join, the more the network adjust the diff (number of zeroes on the next to-be-hashed block). 


The actual maximum difficulty is when current_target=0, but we would not be able to calculate the difficulty if that happened. (fortunately it never will, so we're ok.)
Source: 
There is the 51% attack vector on Bitcoin - if you have 51% of the mining power in your control you can **delay** transactions and reverse **your own** transactions for the time you maintain this 51%. Nothing else. No free coins, no destroying of Blockchain and no magic blocks.
51% is a lot of mining power.

Lot's of servers run on VPS (Shared hardware) - you share the same hardware server with several known or unknown "cloud" users.
Imagine these servers as rooms in a hotel. You can put your ear to the wall and listen to the company in the other room saying the combinations to eachother safe.
By using servers that are not shared by known or unknown people, you are safe. By using VPS servers your risk people listening in your Bitcoin signing and possible theft.
This is all _very_ hard to use as an attack method, all very theoretical.

It's just a new application of the blockchain. before we had Bitcoin: The Currency and Bitcoin: The sign system. Also Namecoin, but that used another blockchain to be fair.
Colored coins are a way to emit Tokens (like vouchers) on the Bitcoin blockchain that cannot be counterfeited.
A real life example could be: I have a carwash and I want to give out "CarwashCoin" - 1 Carwashcoin is valid for a wash of your car. I can emit 1000 of these and give them away or sell them. People could even "trade" them, but that won't be of much use. If they came to my carwash they could pay the Carwashcoin back to me, and get a washed car.

The problem is. there are around 500k words in the Oxford dictionary. that leaves us with 500000^3 possible passwords. That is 1.25×10¹⁷ possible passwords. The number at the end  enlarges the keyspace by tenfold. So about 1.25×10¹⁸

It's not a novice user best-practice to do so. You have to compile vanitygen yourself and run it on a secure system. 
You can make an address like 1Hello....  or 1Bashc0 - The longer the readable "vanity" the longer it takes. After about 8 characters it tends to get almost impossible.

Localbitcoin.com: Iḿ not sure. I think you can if you ask the seller.
Offline wallet: Yes. And offline wallet is just a piece of paper with a key. The bitcoin itself is never offline it's in the blockchain "The Vault".
And yes you can generate paper wallets without being connected to the internet, print the, and they are a valid address to transfer funds to.
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:03:46
it does. It generates 100 keys in advance. To be safe you have to backup a bit more. I would so after each *big* transaction, just to be sure.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:38:42
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:44:15
Yes. it is valid for 100 transactions in/out (it generates keys in advanced). 
However, if you IMPORT a key, it is no longer valid, because that key is not in the previously made backup. After importing, backup again.
Also, burn it to write only media (virusses can destroy USB) and always protect your wallet with a password (don't forget it).

What client did you use? Because the change went to the originating address.
If it gets picked up: The change funds end up in this address:
If it does not get picked up: Nothing changed, and the transaction will be "lost" eventually.
This can take a few hours to days. 
In the meanwhile you could make a forced transaction WITH fee, that will be picked up by the network. This is advanced use, don't do it.

Are we talking Bitcoin-QT here? Yes if it is not too old. 
If you send coins to address X, your remainder goes to something called a "change address" (B). The original address (A) is empty.
Those change address are generated in advance, so that old backup will have the correct keys.
As long as you did not make too many transactions you are ok.

A Solar flare will not kill Bitcoin (blockchain). Or do you mean a solar flare that kills the entire planet's power?
A worldwide power out?
In minutes, people start to panic. Cellphone tower switch over to emergency power and most datacenters switch the diesel generators. After a few hours datacenters will start to fail and so will celltowers. Bank, Govt and other services fail. Offices are without power and phones. The dark side of the planet will have looting and escalating situations in major cities. The countryside will be fine, but will be cut of from the world and has to rely on HAM radio of word of mouth to learn what is going on.
After about 12 hours supermarkets etc. are plundered and/or no longer re-stocked. Distribution centers for foodstock face cooling failure so a lot of produce is going to spoil very fast. Canned food etc. will be hoarded, so will water. Tap water will fail directly or when the water towers run out of aux. pressure.
Hospitals will have their IT services shut down pretty fast, so they are back to landlines after a few hours. Medicine storage sites will face cooling problems but have proper aux. power to stay operational for days. Hospitals will only take emergency cases and run on emergency power. After a few days it could get nasty. No power for oxygen pumps, no new oxygen bottles, no disposal of waste, desinfection machines offline, etc.
Airports will close down because the Flight control etc. only have backup power for a few days. Hundreds of thousands of people are stranded far away from home, not knowing what is going on (except the power being out) and this will escalate.
Fuel stations won't be able to deliver fuel - because the pumps operate on electricity. Some fuel stations will get robbed/ or the manual pumps will get hijacked by looters wanting the last fuel available. Payments won't work, maybe only cash for the food that is left at gas stations - employees would be wise to close the shop. No communication with headquarters possible anyway.
In the following days more failures arise:
Bridges don't work. Land below sealevel gets flooded (Netherlands for example) because the pumps shut down after 24 hours of Diesel power. Sewers don't function properly and decease spreads. Food is scarce, more riots. Farm distribution fails due to broken infrastructure. Internet fails and more segments get torn off the now broken fibrelinks on the ocean floor (Gbics offline).
...but somewhere, in mainland Europe, a small Raspberry Pi Bitcoin node is running. Running on Solar power. It's my little Bitcoin node, waiting for the day the internet goes back online and it will be fine.
Humanity, however, will face larger problems.

True. Iḿ worried about 51%, but you have to remind youself that the things you can do are not that destructive.
51% only lets you stop transactions going through, and you can rewind your own TX (while you remain 51%).
No coins out of nowhere, no sending other people's coin, no reversing other people's transactions.

Bitcoin does clear in 1 hour. Permanent, no way (impossible) to change.
Creditcards and Bank accounts clear in weeks (they are technically reversible) or months. Waiting for the full 6-confirm window on a soda bottle transaction is silly. Only thing needed is a "looking glass" that provides insight in how the transaction is spread across the network's memory pool and you are good.
Like a "Transaction X is seen on major nodes A, B and C - the fee looks ok, good to go!" - Someone, make this :)

Fractional reserve "banking" can be done in Bitcoin. You'd just have to use IOU tokens like Ripple. Because in Bitcoin there are no banks, you are your own bank. So you play fractionally reserve _yourself_ and invest or lend out your own balance with the chance of a profit or interest.
That is the same as the balance on your bank account: It's an IOU value - a claim on the bank the size of your deposit. It's not really _your_ money - not that it matters, you can withdraw it if you would like.
Fractional reserve banking is fine, as long as a) you don't over-do it. and b) the trust remains.

So your argument is: In a world where Electricity is (almost) non-existent and the internet and global communications has totally failed, Gold wins.

ASICs is not a type of chip, ASIC means Application Specific Integrated Circuit.  It means the chip was built specifically to do one task and do it well.
We might see smaller and smaller asics, with better Hash-to-Kwh ratios, cheaper and multi purpose chips (like floor heating with integrated bitcoin mining chips for example).
After that maybe - optical chips without copper.

Yeah, that's what I did for my niece. 
You could put some Bitcoin in a paper wallet (laser printer, seal the paper with a plastic). Or put it in a QR etched on a piece of Innox rust-free metal.

No, that is not how this is going down. They are going to attach "illicit actors" and "funding terrorists" to it, and the banks will need to comply to regulation because of it.

The same could go for USD. Less so, but inflation makes your dollar worth less and less over the years.

Not forever. If all transformer units/high voltage transport is destroyed we are looking at days to weeks of chaos. The fact alone that communication will be almost dead planet-wide is enough - let alone the logistical nightmare and coordination of restoring worldwide power.
If the blackout is limited to a segment of the planet (solar flare) Bitcoin will be fine. The currency (bitcoins) might be hard to trade with/from the affected side of the planet though...
Just wanted to show that if a worldwide powerout happens (solar flare ain't that bad, and won't affect the entire planet, but as a worst case scenario lets pretend we get hit by a Pulsar star or Neutron star radiation [0]). We could also be hit by a Gamma-ray burst. This will destroy electronics *and* vaporize our atmosphere and Ozon layer. Oh joy! [1].

Mtgox was an exchange (like a currency exchange on the street). People had cash/bitcoin stored in an account there to trade with. 
Mtgox is down at the moment, the real reason is unknown. Rumour is they lost coins. If you had coins on the exchange, you have to wait until they make an announcement where the coins .
The proper way would have been that you moved the coins **off** the exchange (to your local wallet) did you not do that?

Talk about throwing a wrench into the system. 
Bitcoin is eating eatself. Great job everyone..
To put this into perspective a bit: This only works for instant-delivery products.
A webshop etc. will at least get a notice from the Bitpay system if a double spent attack has been done. (or "undo" as we now seem to call it). No package is sent out, user can be flagged as troll.
A face-to-face merchant getting scammed like this, is like writing out an uncovered check. If you want to get a free hamburger, undo the transaction. 
Now for online services that provide instant products (microtransactions) - this was already semi-dead but now a dead businessmodel. We need to wait for sidechains to mature.
The whole problem with this is: Greedy miners who mine these blocks, they are almost literally biting the hand (Bitcoin) that feeds them (bitcoins). Negative effect on price, so less gains.

yeah sure! :) you can download Ubuntu ISO (it's a big file, that is a copy of the CD) and burn the ISO to a DVD. Boot from it, and you get the installer. 
It will ask you to install Ubuntu to your hard-drive. Careful, it will destroy Windows and all the files in the process so use a new disk or backup your files.
After the install you have Ubuntu GNU/Linux running. It's a very secure OS. It's free! and updates itself.
Download here: (the donations are optional)
Direct link to the ISO file: 
Old computers need the 32 bit version. new computers can run 64 bit.
 
If you need me to send you a DVD you can run just ask. I can also sent you old hard drives if you want. (I'm guessing you are the lady in the video?)

Educated guess, to be honest. Most mining pools run a version of Linux/Unix - they are not running on Windows at least, or from a macbook. The devs are mostly Linux/Mac guys (so Unix land) and my nodes all run Debian. 
If you wanted to know the numbers, you could do an OS identify sweep with nmap.

@_date: 2014-05-12 06:23:10
I would recommend a good industry standard Hypervisor like Xen or Vmware, and spawn a few instances of bitcoin nodes.
The bottleneck however (and redundancy) of this node will be the internet connections. You can only forward port 8333 (the bitcoin port) to 1 of the nodes. You will need multiple connections ór a VPN to the remaining ones.
If you only have 1 connections just run 1 bare node on the hardware. Mind the power costs though. Also, ask your boss if he is okay with this. You are exposing your business IP address to the Bitcoin network. If he does not understand Bitcoin it could look like you are mining/using corporate resources for personal gain.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:48:53
Don't shoot the messenger.
Bitcoin addresses are best used only once **for sending**. Receiving 100s of transactions is fine, but once you sent **from** the address you should (as a purist/paranoid person) consider the address used/tainted. 
After signing a future quantum computer could derive the privkey out of the pubkey (very, very theoretical). It's not _lost_, you can move in and out multiple times, but not advised by purists.
Eligius pool does not even mine re-used addreses 2 blocks in a row.

Did you add swap to the node? On initial index of the blockchain it does a lot of IO and wants more RAM. Once the blockchain is up-to-date it only scans a few hundred blocks backwards for integrity.
Also, do you use a bootstrap.dat file to accelerate the initial sync of the blockchain? I have a bootstrap.dat file that is up to date to about 2 weeks ago, so initial sync of the blockchain takes about 2 hours.
Just place bootstrap.dat into the .bitcoin folder and start bitcoind - it will detect the file and be up-to-speed in no-time.
Thanks again for doing this.

When the system is used more, transaction costs **per transaction** can even go down because cumulative transaction fees per block go higher. Also, there is the possibility for hashrate/diff to go down. It's a free market.
And with side-chains coming Bitcoin becomes more of a "savings account" - sidechains used for daily small transactions.

A **worldwide** power out?
In minutes, people start to panic. Cellphone tower switch over to emergency power and most datacenters switch the diesel generators. After a few hours datacenters will start to fail and so will celltowers. Bank, Govt and other services fail. Offices are without power and phones. The dark side of the planet will have looting and escalating situations in major cities. The countryside will be fine, but will be cut of from the world and has to rely on HAM radio of word of mouth to learn what is going on.
After about 12 hours supermarkets etc. are plundered and/or no longer re-stocked. Distribution centers for foodstock face cooling failure so a lot of produce is going to spoil very fast. Canned food etc. will be hoarded, so will water. Tap water will fail directly or when the water towers run out of aux. pressure.
Hospitals will have their IT services shut down pretty fast, so they are back to landlines after a few hours. Medicine storage sites will face cooling problems but have proper aux. power to stay operational for days. Hospitals will only take emergency cases and run on emergency power. After a few days it could get nasty. No power for oxygen pumps, no new oxygen bottles, no disposal of waste, desinfection machines offline, etc.
Airports will close down because the Flight control etc. only have backup power for a few days. Hundreds of thousands of people are stranded far away from home, not knowing what is going on (except the power being out) and this will escalate.
Fuel stations won't be able to deliver fuel - because the pumps operate on electricity. Some fuel stations will get robbed/ or the manual pumps will get hijacked by looters wanting the last fuel available. Payments won't work, maybe only cash for the food that is left at gas stations - employees would be wise to close the shop. No communication with headquarters possible anyway.
In the following days more failures arise:
Bridges don't work. Land below sealevel gets flooded (Netherlands for example) because the pumps shut down after 24 hours of Diesel power. Sewers don't function properly and decease spreads. Food is scarce, more riots. Farm distribution fails due to broken infrastructure. Internet fails and more segments get torn off the now broken fibrelinks on the ocean floor (Gbics offline).
...but somewhere, in mainland Europe, a small Raspberry Pi Bitcoin node is running. Running on Solar power. It's my little Bitcoin node, waiting for the day the internet goes back online and it will be fine.
Humanity, however, will face larger problems.

I need to pay my expenses, mortgage, data center costs. I need to remain solvent in order to serve my clients, and I have a reputation to keep up.
I think of bitcoins as that nice car that always seemed to keep going until it didn't - the mechanic warned you, your friends warned you but you kept driving and pooring money into it but it kept breaking down.

Your DB is corrupted it seems. Harddrive could be failing (Run a S.M.A.R.T. test)
Fixing the DB:
* Stop the client.
* Backup the bitcoin directory
     ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
* Backup the wallet.dat (if you have not already). remember the password if you have one!
* Then, rename the directory Bitcoin_OLD
* Place a new Bitcoin directory, and put the wallet.dat in it.
* Download the bootstrap.dat file 
* Also place bootstrap.dat in the Bitcoin folder (To speed up the initial sync
* Start Bitcoin-qt - let it sync.
Alternative: Use Electrum client. It does not need the entire sync etc. - Your client is the reference client, and not optimized for end-user usage.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:57:21
You can, but after that moment (when you sign the address and move the coins to like... your cold storage or wallet) the address is less secure against quantum computer attacks.
