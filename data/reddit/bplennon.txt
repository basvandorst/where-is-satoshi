I owe you all an apology
...for bitching about the price dropping to $3600 after I paid $4000 for it

Here I was just about to dump them for taking the wrong fork.  Got another week to sit tight

Bought at 4000.  Obviously I'm unhappy at the moment.
But risk is risk.  Everything I'm taught in school tells me that I'm supposed to be happier trying something bold that doesn't work out - than sitting around moping about missed opportunity in case it had shot up instead of down.
:\  $3600 and falling

* I see the drop two days ago  
* Decide to take the plunge  
* Coins drop more  
* Problem verifying bank for Celery &amp; Coinbase  
* Couldn't buy yet  
* Price goes up 15%

I could have been in at $3300.  Now I'm in at 4060.  Regrets or apprehension or glory?  Who knows?

Hah there are people who study these patterns to the PhD level - and the game is almost infinitely complex to a layman.
Your hypothesis seems valid - but what if there are others who already have caught on to that - they'll be buying &amp; selling extra around those times - and those 'arbitrage' transactions have a normalizing effect on the price.
Other people may be blatantly gaming the system - who the hell knows what JP Morgan is doing - but whatever it is, they have billions of dollars to throw around, and hundreds of people working on that stuff who are better at the financial game than I am.
I'm just going to bet long and try to stay out of the day-to-day

More price increase :\
More opportunity missed :\
Support got to me and straightened out the deposit thing

Best alternatives?

Thanks - changing people's minds isn't easy, but you do what you can - one slice at a time
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:40:06
I'm a little more worried about the formidable but steady, day-after-day drop :\

I was going to buy a hundred bucks' worth in 2009, when it was practically a buzzword.  Probably would have been a millionaire.  Maybe next time.

I just bought my first bitcoin last week.  From Coinbase.
* Did I pick a bad broker?  Recommended alternatives?  
* What is Coinbase's role in this?  
* Any tl;dr type articles on the 2x movement?  
* From (still) an outsider perspective, it looks like a bunch of internal drama.  Is this that serious, or just a mostly philosophical battle?  Projected effects on the future value of the currency?  
* How often does this kind of stuff happen?  Did I come in at a bad time or is just an everyday part of the experience?

So when's the next Price Thread starting?  I need to finish shifting gears from *lamenting my purchase* to *ballin'*
