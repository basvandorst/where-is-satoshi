Assuming things were done properly, your old balance sheet transaction will have a relative locktime that delays its validation a set amount of blocks after broadcast. Your counterparty will now have the opportunity to undercut that delayed transaction with their own undelayed transaction and not only recover their own funds, but take all of yours as well. The game theory involved is very sound.

Upvoted. This is your rebuttal. Most people don't consider the economics regarding "more efficient" means of security. As for security with no block reward, a well developed derivatives market could solve that problem. One possible scenario: Large stakeholders could hedge against low hashing power with miners taking the other end of those contracts.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:04:39
Uncensored transactions have a cost. Coffee can be done cheaply on LN because you don't have to worry about censorship. If you're doing something TPTB disapprove of then the extra cost to transact directly on the blockchain, which hopefully stayed decentralized enough to remain censorship resistant (you know -- smaller block size, lots of full nodes, etc), will be worth it.

Here's the easy solution to any hard fork: Merge mine the hard fork and 51% attack the old chain into oblivion.  Single ledger preserved.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:53:39
The problem is you seem to expect transaction fees to primarily support mining once the reward goes away.  That will simply drive transactors off the chain to either an alt or some layer / sidechain that's cheaper.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:56:34
A simple majority of miners already have the power to completely destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:32:49
It's simple economics.  People will easily transact off-chain if it gets too expensive.  Inflating past the predetermined 21M is too crude and obfuscates costs (I understand using inflation to bootstrap bitcoin, like now).  Savers, who benefit the most from mining, will end up paying for the bulk of bitcoin's hashing power, just like they are now.
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:32:03
This hard fork should merge mine and 51% attack the old fork with 0 tx blocks. There can only be one. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:39:48
That problem is solvable to some extent.  Merge mine the big block version and 51% attack the old chain so old clients are no longer usable.  The only choice for the 1MB crowd would be to join the new fork or do their own hard fork.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:26:16
So are you saying you'd rather miners and nodes NOT determine their own block size limit, like they have been all along?
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:23:50
Only if their motive is to destroy both forks of bitcoin.  Stakeholders have the opposite incentive and would announce their true intentions well in advance.

@_date: 2015-06-12 17:00:14
Couldn't nodes still implement their own soft caps, increasing the orphan rate of miners trying to propagate larger blocks?
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:43:35
So you're saying most miners today are insane? Empirical evidence refutes your claim.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:49:25
And those advocating for the 1 MB hard limit are ignoring the fact that people are simply rolling out their own soft limits to mitigate DoS attacks.  Why are you so willing to trust end users so much with mempool management but not block size?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:41:47
Meh -- nevermind. You're right.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:12:36
I mean all bitcoin holders would collectively agree on what fee to pay.  Right now they are collectively paying for hashing power (security) through inflation.  Once the block reward effectively disappears, a "tragedy of the commons" would exist: all holders of bitcoin benefit from mining but transactors would be expected to pay for it.  Bitcoin holders are incentivized to support mining but they would be faced with a "you first" dilemma, expecting others to shoulder the cost. This is why many have argued for more inflation beyond 21M.  I think inflation is too crude and has a tendency to not be accounted for (do you see any wallets today that do?).  I understand inflation is necessary now to properly bootstrap and distribute bitcoin but, once established, a direct mining fee charged to all bitcoin holders would be the best way to maintain security.  This would eliminate the tragedy of the commons and hashing power would more accurately represent the demand of its users.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:39:43

Congratulations!  You've just argued that formal science is not science. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:35:15
You are right that the fee market alone cannot sustain miners. As the block reward drops, I think we'll see something akin to an HOA form where all bitcoin holders determine an aggregate fee to incentivize mining.  This would eliminate the "tragedy of the commons" that mining would otherwise be.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:27:24
Credit to for enlightening me to this:
The primary risk of a hard fork is existential. Soft forks are a filtration of what was (and NOT an addition of anything new). They preserve the cumulative stability of the Bitcoin software, which has proven its resilience over the years despite open hostility from powerful rivals, because they only constrict Bitcoin’s current rules / framework. A hard fork, on the other hand, makes new states possible. With soft forks, each change can be ignored, but with hard forks, each change must be re-compared against all of the lines of code with which it interacts, and all possible new (nonlinear, chaotic) software-states must be re-compared to the nearly-infinite variety of practical circumstances under which the Bitcoin service might be interrupted.  Yes, bitcoin used to have a higher block limit but that was trimmed long before it could prove its resilience.  At this point, if something can be solved through soft instead of hard forking, the former is vastly preferred.  Higher certainty in bitcoin's survival is worth the higher costs in complexity and overhead.
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:25:17
No, but forks can merge mine with bitcoin (see namecoin)
@_date: 2015-12-23 01:48:05

@_date: 2015-06-12 20:03:15
That may cause some lengthy forks and lots of orphans, but the highest hashing power will overcome it in the long run.  Also, the old chain being attacked would likely be getting 0 transaction blocks.  Propagation would be super fast.

The price of BTC wouldn't matter as transactions on the main chain drop to a low enough level.  As for your merge mining questions, I'm trying to keep this a predominantly economic exercise and assuming the tech side has been worked out (we can discuss on another thread).  The reason for this exercise is to illustrate the flaw in bitcoin's long-term plan for TX-only miner subsidization, when BTC holders who do not transact also benefit from them.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:03:28
What is your game plan if the hard fork is merge mined and, assuming enough miners are on board, 51% attacks the original chain with perpetual 0tx blocks?  Will you continue to recommend software that is unusable?
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:56:37
You cannot force demand.  All arbitrarily increasing the TX fee in bitcoin will do is push users out of bitcoin and into cheaper competitors.  Besides, why try and manage TX fee markets indirectly with block size limits?  Why not just pass a hard minimum % fee per transaction?
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:00:16
Who cares?  Both are transfers and take up UTXO space.  Do you think the block size limit distinguishes between the two?
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:58:25
Temporarily having more orphans sure beats having two separate chains going.  As for China, I would argue that the 1MB cap subsidizes them.  Where are the largest pools located right now?
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:18:14
It cuts both ways.  If forking is contentious then, by definition, not forking is contentious as well.  Contention is unavoidable at this point.

One solution is for a majority of the bitcoin market to simply create (or coopt) a different mining algorithm that excludes SHA256 and migrate the existing bitcoin ledger to it.  This is a major move, but if enough people become dissatisfied with the existing mining situation, there's very little barrier to hard-forking and leaving the previous miners behind.

Because we are not in a free market.  We have a gang of thugs that 1) force us to pay for protection services like police, military, the FTC, etc and 2) prevent others from directly competing with them through threats of violence.  Point 1 tends to cause complacency in the market due to the product/service, even when substandard, already being provided with the cost already sunk (for example, if everyone were forced to pay for a substandard car, they would most likely just take their "free" (read, sunk cost) car rather than pay full price for a better alternative).  Point 2 demotivates competition for obvious reasons.
If you believe the FTC is really so valuable, then they do not need government's guns to force people to pay for their services anyway.  They would thrive in an open, competitive free market.

They are different in that Mastercoin relies on an intermediary alt-coin, which also must have high liquidity, while ChromaWallet does not.


I think projects like Mastercoin, Ethereum, etc, that can quickly raise funds through alt-coin sales certainly get off to faster starts but, due to their inherently inefficient reliance on the liquidity of their proprietary coins on top of bitcoin, they will eventually lose out to the ones that don't use said middle coin.

The fact that this has been debated for years, yet the effects of increasing it are not well understood, is all the more reason for Gavin to code the hard fork and set a timeline.  It's time to understand the effects of increasing the block size.  Hell, the time was 2 years ago.

has the most well thought out response:


now-- this is strong evidence that supermajority of the hashrate is
equipment with state of the art power efficiency. (I've also heard
more directly-- but I think the this evidence is more compelling
because it can't be tainted by boasting). If a pre-programmed ramp and
drop is set then it has the risk of massively under-setting
difficulty; which is also strongly undesirable (e.g. advanced
inflation and exacerbating existing unintentional selfish mining)...
and that is before suggesting that miners voluntarily take a loss of
inflation now.


prudent to have a difficulty step patch (e.g. a one time single point
where a particular block is required to lower bits a set amount) ready
to go in the unlikely case the network is stalled. Of course, if the
alternative is "stuck" from a large hashrate drop the deployment would
be both safe and relatively uncontroversial. I think the
unfavorability of that approach is well matched to the implausibility
of the situation, and likely the right coarse of action compared to
risky interventions that would likely cause harm. The cost of
developing and testing such a patch is low, and justified purely on
the basis of increasing confidence that an issue would be handled (a
fact _I_ am perfectly confident in; but apparently some are not).


comment, but most altcoin "tolerate difficulty drop" changes have made
them much more vulnerable to partitioning attacks and other issues
(e.g. strategic behavior by miners to increase inflation), and have
actually been exploited in practice several times (solidcoin's being
the oldest I'm aware of). Many survived a fairly long time before
being shown to be pretty broken, simply because they were deployed in
cases where no one cared to attack. I'm currently doubtful that
particular path would be fruitful.

James never seems to take into consideration what countermeasures the rest of the network would take against a malicious 51% attack up to, and including, a hard fork to a different POW.  The miners can be fired if they misbehave.

As I understand it, both chains will be valid to the older nodes -- they will choose the one with the most POW. The newer nodes will not see the older chain as valid no matter what. If / when the newer chain gets majority POW, the older chain will reorg and effectively disappear. If economic majority chooses to go with the UASF and ignore any other chain, then remaining nodes and miners are heavily incentivized to upgrade, or risk being reorged out.

One major difference is that the chains can merge back when enough miners upgrade. In fact, it adds tremendous incentive for miners and old nodes to upgrade. Once majority hash power goes to the new rules, the old chain will eventually reorg and disappear.

I understand it's best not to create a fork. If an overwhelming economic majority go with it then miners are incentivized to follow or lose money. It's best not to do unless a majority of hash rate already is on board.

You do realize that miners have full control over this right? Nodes can be faked and sybil attacks are easy. Unless the consensus decides to HF to a different POW, they will be forced to follow whatever blocks the majority hash power builds upon.
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:13:09
Since it is relatively inexpensive to sybil attack nodes, how do you stop miners (who are the best connected) from changing the consensus in their favor? How do you stop any malicious actors from changing the block size consensus to their whim?
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:04:31
No that would give miners control of throughput, pushing the resulting costs onto helpless node operators. Miners /= free market.

How does he propose making the block size determined by the free market? Nobody has been able to solve that problem.

Your assumptions are faulty. Users would have no power to set block size. Unless the entire consensus of users decides to HF to a new POW, they will be forced to accept whichever blocks the majority hash rate decides to include.

Regular hard forks are a bad idea for a system that stores value.  Bitcoin is not Google Hangouts or MS Word where, if you break it, patches roll out and only minor inconveniences result.  In the case of bitcoin, massive amounts of wealth can be irrecoverably lost / stolen.
What is especially crucial in bitcoin, over other software, are potentially fatal bugs (like the ability to create unlimited amounts of bitcoin -- an actual bug that had to be dealt with years ago).  The current code has withstood substantial scrutiny and attack, even when valued at billions of dollars and regarded with hostility by governments.  That's very significant.  Hard forks can introduce new fatal bugs while soft forks can't.
For the layman, a soft fork is a narrowing of existing rules in the protocol.  Nothing is being added, just something is being restricted in some way.  A hard fork adds new rules and, therefore, new unknowns that can weaken the system as a whole.  That's why they need to be vetted to the extreme before implementation.
A good way to look at it is (credit to Paul Sztorc since I'm paraphrasing him) if x is “the probability that a severe bug is discovered in Bitcoin”, a soft fork cannot increase x, whereas a hard fork can.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:52:17
Agreed.  This has to do with breach of contract.  Even existing Merchant / Common Law can account for bitcoin.  It's just like any other ledger that contains implicit promises and obligations.  People gave up their private keys (possession) to MtGox *on the condition* that they be paid back the equivalent to whatever their current balance was in BTC.  They never gave up ownership.  MtGox broke their promise to pay.  Breach of contract.

This is indeed the fundamental problem.  Central planning of other peoples' resources (which is what the block size cap effectively is) can never accurately reflect those users' preferences.

The premise that tx fees alone will not sufficiently subsidize hashing power is correct (non-transacting hodlers benefit more from mining than transacting non-hodlers) but why use inflation?  It's a horrible method of accounting.  I foresee a future where something similar to a bitcoin HOA gets written into the protocol.  An adjustable collective mining fee gets paid (probably as a percentage) out of all balances to sustain whatever hashing power the market prefers.  This way the cost of mining is directly seen by all, rather than obscured by inflation.

The network won't fragment so much as produce more orphans.  The proper way to configure a limiting node would be to accept all incoming valid blocks, but simply refuse to relay any larger than whatever size is defined.  Separate network or not, competing miners who choose not to propagate a block that's larger than a certain percentage of the nodes' set limits would profit from attempting to orphan it with their own smaller block.  I would love to see a simulation similar to Gavin's or Pieter's but with node limits factored in.
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:52:37
Yes.  No different than opening a bank account in that sense.  He needs to keep it properly funded.  The beauty of the LN is, however, that Bob at any time can choose to act as a middleman any time he wants.  Based on his connections and the changing needs of the network, he may find times it's very profitable to provide the service.
@_date: 2015-07-31 23:07:20
The miners *do* care if those nodes belong to well-connected hubs and wallet providers.  The block relay network only benefits the miners.  Nodes still have to download whatever blocks are mined and do not receive any block rewards for it.  They have plenty of incentive to place size limits on what propagates.
Example: Mining Pool A creates a very large block and attempts to transmit it.  Being on the block relay network, all the other mining pools instantly see that it will be refused by all the major nodes, making their attempt to orphan that block a profitable venture.  Soon after, Mining Pool B solves a competing block and makes it a size acceptable to all major nodes.  The B block out-propagates the A block, therefore successfully orphaning it.

They are all in the bargaining phase:
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:01:33
It's not really a big deal.  Bittorrent clients, for example, have always allowed each user to manage their up and down bandwidth as they see fit.  A spontaneous free market in bandwidth emerged as a result.
In bitcoin, it's the aggregate that miners will pay attention to.  It won't matter if a few rogue nodes set radically different relay policies than most, since blocks will still propagate through the majority of the network.  Also, not all nodes will be equal.  Ones that service a lot of clients or are preferred by the market in other ways will have more importance to miners.  For example, they would definitely want their blocks to be accepted by SPV wallet operators and other very well connected hubs.
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:06:55
I think that by the time this becomes an issue there will be a more elegant technical solution.  If not, then the market will pick the most efficient way to aggregate the cost of mining.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:45:35
Not if the nodes (especially well connected nodes like SPV wallet providers) refuse to relay those larger blocks, increasing their orphan rate.  Only a miner with 51% plus hashing power can reduce that marginal cost to 0.  Of course, block size will be the least of our concerns then.

You have to think about when the block reward drops low enough.

Not really.  The proposal in your link seems to promote keeping a hard coded limit, but just having it set in some sort of democratic process.  Mine involves having no hard-coded cap.  Nodes would accept all incoming valid blocks but simply refuse to relay any that are larger than whatever they specify at that moment.  This effectively creates a free market in block size while staying compatible with the network.  I think this would also result in a *mimimum* block size emerging as well.  Node operators that have a general distaste for empty blocks could simply refuse to relay any below a certain size.  If enough of the network did this, empty blocks would become too risky for miners to try and propagate.  Empowering full nodes like this would also incentivize more people to run them, resulting in more decentralization.

Brain wallets are bad?  It should be simple for them to crack this 8 character brain wallet and collect their 20 BTC (the other 10 provided by Warp Wallet devs when proof of hack is produced): 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:32:16
Rusty's proposal should function just as well as Poon/Dryja's original with the exception that the monitoring of revoked transactions cannot be outsourced without compromising your security.  Translation: You would have to monitor your lightning channel at all times until it is closed.  The use of escape transactions are brilliant malleability workarounds though.  Excellent work!
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:13:19
Couldn't the nodes also fight back by refusing to relay blocks over whatever size limit they choose to set?  A valid block that gets 0% propagation is guaranteed to be orphaned.
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:34:43
No, a brain wallet is a private key derived from whatever combination of words YOU choose to remember.  Why does SHA256 have to be used to qualify?  Does using scrypt suddenly make one unable to remember the same passcode?  The only Nazi here is you attempting to redefine the terminology.
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:47:25
Greg's point is that you can sacrifice capacity in the core layer and improve it in the upper layers, while you cannot gain back any sacrificed security.

Again, you present no advantage of inflation over an aggregate fee (something that everyone is also forced to pay).  At least the latter is easier to account for.  Empirical evidence: Do you see any wallets today that account for your losses due to the block reward?

You need to read up on the term "hard fork". It does not mean what you think it means.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:50:31
Only if you're willing to trust your funds with said node, since you would need to give it your secret hash pre images.  In this current iteration, you would need to monitor the channel 100% yourself to keep it secure.

@_date: 2016-02-25 19:15:34
This is true, assuming nothing new is learned between now and the time LN + 133 MB blocks would be needed, which is highly unlikely.  This is why the block size will not increase until absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:25:44
Those "neutral hubs" wouldn't simply allow any block size.  Without a hard cap, they will set limits themselves.  Miners will find the block size being policed by the nodes, including the ones that matter: Well connected hubs and wallet providers.

@_date: 2015-07-31 22:36:57
Correct.  You cannot commit more than you have currently available in your channel.  A robust lightning network with sophisticated routing, however, would find funded channels and a market would develop to keep key channels funded, including even negative fees (the channel pays you) to replenish a depleted channel.

Actually, you are correct as far as risk management goes.  The LN nodes who can most efficiently manage this risk (along with other costs) will be the most used.  Again, the low barrier to entry for competition will maintain razor thin margins between MC and MR, along with applying heavy downward pressure on MC.

Paul takes care of that nicely. TLDR, POS's (in any form) fatal flaw is economic: 
I suggest reading and understanding the entire blog post for context but here is a snippet (emphasis added):
"WORKING ON WHAT?
What will these individuals spend their X dollars on, to produce the block? Maybe they’ll be generating lots of addresses, or using computing power to examine many alternate block histories (under proof-of-stake (PoS), both of these use CPU power to increase the likelihood of generating coins).
The true answer: Who cares?! Whatever is done will consume (“waste”) $X of economic activity. We have merely transformed the PoW algorithm into something less straightforward and less cumulative.
For example, switching the payout-trigger to a social or political dimension (as in Delegated-PoS) would merely transpose the work-expenditures correspondingly to the realms of bribery and propaganda, which Bitshares has already seen. Others worry about a ‘black market’ for once-full-but-now-empty private keys. Of course, a stable solution to these problems is definitionally impossible: by definition, **there is always an incentive to work until marginal cost equals marginal revenue**."

How flexible will the scripting be for BIP65?  I think something like an expiration (effectively the inverse of nlocktime, where a transaction would become permanently invalid at a specified block height) would be useful for the lightning network, so old HTLC's can be set to permanently expire.  This would handle the issue described by rusty here: 
"You need to be online every 40 days to check that an old HTLC hasn’t leaked, which will require some alternate solution for occasional users (shut down channel, have some third party, etc)."

Again, you still don't address the economic issues. You do understand that a public blockchain is among the most expensive and inefficient ways to manage data, yes? The question you need to answer is why is it worth the extra expense? Why does a DAPP need to be stored and independently executed on every single node, including all non-participants? Let's refer back to your DAO vs. multisig comparison, where you stated how much more efficient the former was. Is it really? Yes, in multisig, there is more effort required by the participating parties, but with a DAO on Ethereum, the computations are pushed onto every single node on the network. Bitcoin nodes, in contrast, need only verify the results.  Each individual computation on the DAO may be more efficient, but not after you multiply it by the thousands or tens of thousands. This lack of economic reasoning is prevalent among coders.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:07:17

That would require you to change the protocol and, since "anyoncanspend" transactions already exist, effectively invalidate the entire block chain and start over. At that point, you will not be running a Bitcoin node but a new altcoin. Why wait? Why not just hard fork now?
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:28:09


You mentioned one economically viable use case. This question was asked by Paul Sztorc back in 2014 (  ) and nobody has come up with anything more.


Risk of what? Why does a DAPP for a charity trust need to exist on a blockchain rather than privately between the parties concerned? Putting said DAPP on a blockchain increases costs and lowers flexibility. Also, since a blockchain can only enforce what is within its own system, how can it prevent gaming / fraud outside of its scope of control? All these limitations serve to increase costs.


False. Hostile governments have increased the cost of running prediction markets in an otherwise more efficient centralized system (see InTrade for a good example). Enough so that running a prediction market on a much less efficient system, like a blockchain, is economically viable. I hope this clarifies the relevance of my statement.


I'm saying they will not be any cheaper. That's the key.


You may as well have written a paper about a perpetual motion machine. Prediction markets need to access data outside their own respective systems. This requires oracles in some form.


This does nothing to demonstrate economic superiority.


Someone can't refute my argument.
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:38:26
Not really. Miners are captive to the investors. The go where the money goes.
@_date: 2016-10-06 17:38:58
Your mentioning of only one possible use case illustrates my point. Why have such a general, open and vulnerable system when, at best, there are only a few of blockchain use cases that make any economic sense? Now on to your examples.
The very concept of a DAO is an economic disaster, where smart investors are disincentivized to participate because their advantage would be diluted by dumb investors with influence over their funds. A DAO is a stillborn idea.
Because of hostile governments, prediction / derivatives markets can thrive on a blockchain, but you seem to shrug off Ethereum's problems, security being a key area. A general, open system like Ethereum simply offloads all the security responsibilities (and resulting costs) to the DAPP coders -- and we've seen how well that has worked out. I wouldn't worry so much about oracles stealing funds than I would hackers finding vulnerabilities in any Ethereum-based prediction market's relatively huge attack surface (compared to Hivemind). On top of that, any profitable prediction market would quickly fall victim to parasite contracts (see  ) and become economically unsustainable. You can make whatever statements you like about Ethereum's "potential" security, efficiency and effort, but the past empirical evidence has proven otherwise. Ethereum is not a more efficient blockchain than bitcoin. It simply shifts the economic burdens to different places -- and grossly mis-aligns incentives in the process.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:34:31
Yes they can. The blockchain only needs to be used to verify that they were run. Storing and running dapps on a block chain is economic suicide.

Why would you want to empower botnets? They can readily adapt to any change in POW, which nullifies a key advantage non-miners have now: The threat of changing POW. SHA ASIC's are a signal of commitment to bitcoin by the miners. Why? Because if the system fails or users decide to change POW, miners lose their entire investment. Their ASIC's cannot be used for anything else.

40 something here.  My siblings and I grew up with a 2600 as our babysitter.  It was a very good one.  My parents always knew where they would find us when they got home.  At 12, I got an Atari 600XL with cassette drive as my first "real" computer, dabbling in BASIC and assembly but mostly gaming (Miner 2049er FTW!)  Once my brother got his Amiga 500, we were all in.  I bought a Supra 2400 modem and we were all over any BBS we could discover.  I remember listening to MOD files from Moby years before his first record deal.  My Amiga 4000 was the first and only computer I sold for a profit, since Commodore went under and video editors were clamoring for Toaster compatible hardware.  I was using GEnie when I first discovered the internet through a portal they offered.  I was in my 20's and too naive to realize the impact it would have on society, and missed riding that wave of opportunity as a result.  I remember talking with the founder of Earthlink when he was just starting out, hearing how he lied to his parents to get a loan.  He told them he was starting a restaurant and said if they knew he intended to start an ISP, they would have disowned him.  Watching my 401k shrink significantly in the tech crash and then again in 2008 spurred me to become an economics geek as well -- just in time to recognize the potential of bitcoin when it came out.  I'd be damned if I was going to miss another opportunity and got in early.  There's no substitute for the experience I gathered in the past few decades.  I feel like it all culminated in the moment I discovered Satoshi's creation and exclaimed, "This is fucking genius!"

For example, I would still feel a lot safer using  for hedging given their volume, better-than-most transparency and 1.5 year up-time.  Also, with BTC-settled futures contracts I'm continuing to support the value of BTC as well.  BitUSD is a competitor (all altcoins are) and every time I sell BTC for BitUSD, I am hurting the value of BTC.  I personally look forward to more BTC-as-reserve-currency exchanges.  appeals to me a lot more than BitUSD because of this.

On a smaller scale and over a shorter period of time, with a long term average increase in purchasing power and economic growth.  The argument you originally made was that these things were worse before fiat currency, yet the two deepest and longest U.S. recessions (The Great Depression and our current financial fiasco) have happened since the forming of the Fed.  Compare that to, say, Panama, a country that has not had a Central bank for about as long as the Fed has existed (a little longer actually) AND actually has this little tidbit in its constitution, "There will be no forced fiat paper currency in the Republic. Thus, any individual can reject any note that he may deem untrustworthy."  They also have no capital controls and no government monopolies on banking.  Guess how many systemic banking / financial crises this little economy has had in it's 110 year history?  ZERO!  I'll take that track record over the Fed's any day.

For those worrying about volatility, this is what futures and options markets are for.  Businesses can't function in the global economy without them (fiat currencies are anything but stable).  As Bitcoin adoption grows and the cost of entry/exit continues to decline, the demand for hedging against volatility will continue to increase, along with profit potentials for anyone able to fill this need.  That means you will start seeing bigger and more professional players (as opposed to small-time calamities like Bitcoinica) getting into the game.

How am I blindly criticizing a protocol?  Am I seeing things incorrectly when I point out the opaqueness of closed-source software?  Am I missing something when I point out the counter party risks involved with surrendering control of ones assets (USD, BTC, etc) to "gateways" and trading with derivatives of them instead?  Am I blind when I illustrate that forcing users to a single anti-spam currency is not only unnecessary but creates a serious moral hazard?  Bitcoin is attractive because it eliminates counter party risk.  All that "wasted energy" you complain about is what mitigates this risk.  The market will decide how valuable that indeed is (apparently you don't value it much).  Ripple, on the other hand, exposes one to even more counter party risk than the traditional banking system.  It basically turns everyone into a creditor.  Without proper training in financial risk management (there's a reason why banks would still be needed in a free market economy) it's a recipe for disaster, with major defaults rippling through the entire system.  If (when) a major gateway goes under or skips town then all hell will break loose.  Even if I didn't expose myself to them directly, I'd likely find myself suffering losses due to indirect exposure.  Ripple, with all its technology, still boils down to being a credit based economy.  Historically, those have always ended in ruin.

Ah yes, how to lie with statistics.  The FBI's classification of acquaintance and domestic homicide (the study most referred to by anti-gunners) requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the victim.  What that means is if they were anything from rival drug dealers to enemy gang members, so long as they knew each other in any way, they got lumped into that category by the FBI.  Also, most murderers, including inter-family murderers, have a long history of violent crime on their record prior to such killings.

There are more possible addresses than there are estimated atoms in the entire universe.  The odds of generating a duplicate address are low enough to not be concerned about.  I'm willing to bet you have a higher probability of being sucked into a black hole, so worry about that first. ;)

Let me just say that, after going through the near 95% drop in 2011, I had a new found respect for Warren Buffett.  Long-termers hold and only pay attention to the fundamentals -- but it's sure not easy.

Also, You can feel free to stick with your Fed-driven system.  All I and many others ask is that you not force us to do the same.  I'll pick the system that does not rely on threats of violence as a core part of its existence, thank you very much.

Does it matter?  Lawmakers weren't forced to create the Fed either.  One good tall tale deserves another.

Seriously, all these problems have been dealt with centuries ago with what became common law.  Educate yourself.

Funny, because the U.S. also uses the American dollar and how many systemic banking / financial crises have they had?  Try again.  It's not because Panamanians have currently chosen the U.S. dollar as their de facto currency.

I always thought he was a douche, but now he's moved up a few notches on the Cool Guy Meter.

Well, it did drop to just a few cents (or even $.01?) during the infamous MtGox hack and dump (now removed from the charts) so, technically, the author is right.

Your argument is begging the question.  Based on your circular-reasoning-logic, I and a few of your neighbors have the authority to start taking money from you and driving your car simply because we decide it is so.  After all, you are free to leave if you disagree but, otherwise, you must be agreeing with us if you choose to stay.

Let's try this again.  Should be fixed now...
