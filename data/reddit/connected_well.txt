bitconnect is not forked coin am i right ?
btc and bch come from same place, and everyone holding btc at that time got free BCH . i think this is more than enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:21:45
how? don't you watch prices when you buy something ?

id invest smaller $$ into some altcoin(s)
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:16:44
this isnt a thing ! .
21 btc holders are a thing. stop inflating shit like FIAT money
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:38:58
what patience? its simple mathematics.
you invest 100$ today.
someday if BTC reaches million you have 10k$ .
ask yourself, is this doable? and are you happy with 10k when others made millions same time.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:15:15
21 club ise when you get 21 bitcoins, as there can only be 1 million persons like this.
not one btc.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:05:42
yeah. US citizens are like live stock, no matter where you go, still the master own you and your skin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:36:22
but... but. this is exact same problem in everyday life, you could be robbed anytime, be it about money, your shoes. don't matter.
do you really lose sleep over this ?
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:03:37
nawh dude, hes old buy went trough. so if he pays 5k$ he gets 50BTC (worth 400k$ today) . good deal.
OP, if this goes well, spread the joy, donate to your local animal shelter or buy new sneakers for the hobo.

25 BTC :D not much.
poloniex. starts asking questions when withdrawing, im not making this shit up. 
they want proof where the coins come from, if mined, they want mining rig receipt, if traded , they want to know exactly where from. 
i think its not the safest way to store wealth in btc for couple of years and then you have to start answering all those questions. exchange sites are not IRS. what they worry about? i could understand if they traded bitcoin for hard cash, buts its bank transfers, its not their problem to worry and ask confirmations, EVERY IRS ON PLANET will see you bank in and out money, so why exchange sites are so worried? its not like im ringing poloniex bell and am like " psst. kids, wanna buy some bitcoins, "
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:14
new news, he corrected to MILL
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:06:04
but why exchange sites set limits? they make money when people exchange. so if it would me my business the more people exchange to fiat or to coins to better for me.
but somwhow exchange sites dont want you to do that. 
most people havent tried to withdraw larger ammounts from their accounts, you would not believe the shitstorm you get.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:11:14
irs? so america right ?
you americans are taxed for life, dont matter where you go off living, you are like products on shopping mall, always counted for and expected to exchange for cash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:17:54
250$ means
that if bitcoin goes from 10k to 40k$
you have 1000$ .
not much
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:01:58
its not worth anything before you cashout, remember this son.

bitfinex and thether is mostly used by americans am i right ? f*cking those guys again.. cant we build like wall around usa and let them be ?

never bet/gamble with money you cannot lose. if life savings must be lost to learn a lesson, who are you or i to stop people from learning ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:26:59
and you think they wont blink an eye if i transfer 25k$ out for say everyday for a month ? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:34:32
33% more like 60-70% . 
sometimes im worried that i might read and take advice from 9 year olds, this cant be logical that 20yr olds or more act like this.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:54:11
if bch is not better, then its not worse either.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:56:02
you understand that in order to become millionare that way.
your 25% should for example be 250,000$ , then when btc hits 44k$ per coin, you have made million, oh and the taxes too.
somehow i think you will not be millionare
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:09:43
there are millions of BCH and you think total 180000 BCH relased will make a difference of any kind ?  wow, must be really hard to be you
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:10
but they dont have to have money ready ? its a FUCKING EXCHANGE. its simple as that, they sell my coins, they dont buy them themselves you understand that right ?
and look at the BTC price. only rising, meaning there is more buyers than sellers, so what exactly is stopping them, to do what exchanges to, sell the coins ,take small amount form themself and pass me the rest? 
my english is not good, but i hope you understand how they profit only when people sell and buy, so why not do it ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:41
if you from US and A then you fooked either way. you are farm animals and belong to your owners, but with other countires its easier, i would look up offshore companies. in belize capital gains tax 0% . so you could open company and account and take our your profits from there? 
same as regular rich folks do.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:54:20
50$ means, that if btc rises from 8k$ to 16k$ you then have 100$ . 
not much...
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:02:21
what bch split son ? there is no split. educate,medidate, 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:52:07
i have heard from couple friends, that you cant withdraw your money, exchange sites start asking information and try to avoid paying. exactly like they didnt want to set you limits higher.
isnt this against the law. they let people trade and make money, and make deposits. but when its comes to withdrawing, they start making it difficult, asking questions, that they did not care when you deposited money, its really weird, if coins are really worth the money they say, why hassle people over withdrawing, its not like they have to pay it for themselves , they even make profit over you withdrawing.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:07:38
5000 transactions in a month ?
166 in a day ?
assuming you sleep 8 hours a day. 
then it will be 10 transactions in an hour.
 are you kidding me ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:47:58
and is exchange sites phishing for info? 
never ive seen exchange registering site that asks all the info at once. 
they always make easy registering process , name and email.
then go check email. and boom, they want more information.
then everything seems okay, until you withdraw and boom, more questions.
example, you and i make a bet over lets say hockey game, you win, and i owe you 100$. but when its my time to pay i will tell i need additional information and you have to run 4 miles under a minute or i will not pay you.
do this sound fair? would you taken a bet when youd knew all the stupid rules before hand ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:34:19
yes double your 50$ (fiddy) while cats double 8k$ . 
you are better off with altcoins with fiddy
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:41:08
i quote that link you posted " I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason."
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:52:32
how can you loose money when pump is over ? you can only lose money when selling them .
boohoo, they pump their coins, use their friends with mining pools, wtf. this is LIFE . all the users here are in it for the money, so you see other people being smarter and better connected than you, so you come here to whine ? really ?
