Agreed, this could have happened to any wallet. It's happened before this attack on KMD, and most likely will happen again in the future unfortunately.

This isn't true. 
The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular: the attacker published a “useful” package (electron-native-notify) to the npm registry, waited until it was in use by the target, and then updated it to include a malicious payload.
The hack was an upstream attack, and the KMD wallet was vulnerable because they relied on this JS library from NPM. Thankfully the dev team at KMD was able to decipher the location of where the hacker was storing all the private keys he stole and obtained a copy of the keys themselves. They hacked the hacker
They then preceded to sweep as many addresses as they could before the hacker could do it, essentially racing the hacker. While this is extremely odd, it seems like it was indeed the best course of action given that the hacker was actively attacking people's wallets.

I think its dangerous to assume that money will flow out of these traditional investments and into crypto. It may work out like this in the long run (I think it will), but if the traditional markets crash I see crypto getting knocked down along with these markets as investors like to hold cash during those times. Once the aftermath settles we may see that cash find its way into crypto rather than the traditional markets.
In short a global recession will hurt crypto like all other markets, and a few years later might help crypto.

Exactly, this is what I said will happen when we see the next global recession. Crypto will take a hard hit like everything else, but in the long term it will be good for crypto. I don't see a global recession causing an influx of capital to BTC right away. That's all I'm saying

I hope you're right but from my experience in economic down trends investors aren't looking to make money just not lose it also check gold during 2008
