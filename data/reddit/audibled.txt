When I took a picture in a McDonalds in Geneva one of the workers ran from the back kitchen and grabbed my phone  right out of my hand and deleted the pic.  Was the fucking craziest thing.. (I was taking a pic of their weird (compared to my Canadian) menu).

That seems pricey for 10th/s.  Bitmain 14.5th/s are $499 (plus 100 shipping &amp; whatever customs)
.  you should be able to find some 13.5th/s for cheap (Sub $500 USD).  though I wouldn't unless you have super CHEAP power.

Is t it free?  (I don’t use e-transfer much, but don’t recall ever being charged s fee).

I have cheap electricity and I just added two.  At the prices they are at, if you have free electricity then hell ya.
Just remember they are fucking hot.  
(My server room hit 102f yesterday when a venting fan died). 
I love gpu mining but, imho, now is not the time to invest in that.
As well I expect an updated S9 sooner than later..  (could be tomorrow.. could be a few years)

and according to the Globe and Mail
" Dean Skurka, vice-president of finance and compliance at Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform Bitbuy, said he’s concerned that investors who still have money locked up in their Quadriga trading accounts won’t be able to regain all of their funds. Mr. Skurka previously worked in the restructuring and insolvency groups at Fuller Landau, James Williams &amp; Associates and Crowe Soberman, and has been involved in many restructurings.
“These proceedings will result in a long process, which will likely result in end users experiencing ***significant loss***,” Mr. Skurka said in an e-mail. “There will be a long road ahead for the remaining players to regain the confidence of Canadian consumers.”"

lol, lawyers round up, it would be solid $600/hour. They don't have time to mess with pennies.  
good thing the court is appointing accountants...
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:43:16
Same here.  On Tuesday the Nova Scotia Court will be appointing Ernst and Young, and they ~~should~~  will do a thorough job of reviewing cash resources versus liabilities, and priority.  
Its possible we all get 100% of what we had.  its also possible we get nothing or pennies on the dollar.
just subscribe to this Reddit and I'm sure you will be kept up to date on what information is publicly available. 
The ways I lost:
1. Fiat by way of a wire initiated in November and marked complete in December.  (considerable amount of mining revenue)
2. Fiat of approx $1100 in (i guess according to the TOS) quad bucks (I had just sold some mining last week and was risking it for the 20%, i moved some eth out, then some back in to sell,); and
3. and i think .1 btc (forget if it sold it all and is part of  fiat withdrawal above or if I was holding still holding it on this exchange). 
How i see it going down :
1. As far as the Fiat wire is concerned, I hope E&amp;Y accepts my logic that the Canadian funds left Quad before they had financial issues and I get 100%.  the Cash should be there, and from accounts it is.
2. The $1100 i had sitting there in quad bucks (CAD FIAT), I assume the majority of that will disappear.  I may get pennies on the dollar.  probably gone
3. the 1 BTC.  Again, If the cold storage is gone, which is the real issue, then kiss this good bye.  Gerald died and took the keys with him.  or exit scammed. we should know this soon.  from all accounts, assuming no one is lying those funds may be locked forever, welcome to the joys of bitcoin when being your own bank means keeping your own Fort Knox safe, which is why crypto can be way scary
You can trust a lot of us (as i know im a very small fish in this game) will be following the proceedings and monitor E&amp;Y closely.  we might not hear hear much anytime soon, but end of February march we should have a larger picture of what has truly occurred.  
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:42:43
For those using Quad as a storage tool that easy to say.  But there are a lot of people here who only moved funds there to sell.  I lost no (well very little) crypto, just fiat, which wire was marked complete over a month ago.

So be safe and don't own bitcoin?

If you read the article you would know that an undercover agent told her that he was a drug dealer and she was pretty much laundering his illegal drug money.. and she shrugged it off... if banker (knowingly) did this they would be in jail too.. 
This really has nothing to do with btc, but laundering drug money.

He's just pissy his province wont exploit their resources, allow a Pipeline, or ship fuel from more than 2%  of their coastline,  so their fuel is almost twice the price of Saskatchewan's.  I would be too.
