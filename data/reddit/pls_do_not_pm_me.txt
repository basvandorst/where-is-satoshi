You aren't stuck fully. Go to this site and make a public complaint. 
Most casino problems are solved there. Sign up and click "File a complaint" it will be visible publicly until it is solved. 
I'm really sorry man :/ I wish I could help you further.

CrownedPixel can you look into your bet log history to see the debit and credit of the funds onto the table. Post that, and cloud bet will be shunned.

I almost feel like is a bot that is encouraging the world that we know to engage in deeper empathy. But how can a bot empathize if it is a bot?

There definitely needs to be some more investigating on their behalf.  When they said the bet was not made,  did they return the original 20 btc to you (totalling 29)? If not what is there excuse for the bet not being recognised if 20 btc has just vanished from your account?

I wouldn't associate being passionate with bitcoin meaning they invest  in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a lot more than a currency. They would definitely back it though.

No no I am not talking about you scamming someone, I am saying someone might scam you saying they are from Nepal but just stealing your coins.

Head onto a forum like Hackfroums and you could probably buy $1 of BTC for paypal, but be prepared to go first.

Localbitcoins is shit.

I think he is more trying to figure out who satoshi is because he has 1 million BTC on addresses with no output.

* Expensive Fees
* Slow delivery 
* Bitcoins can be seized/chargebacked after purchase (intervening with Bitcoins decentralised nature)

I in someway agree. Maybe 50/50 would be a nice split?
