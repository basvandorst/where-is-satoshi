Ever heard of fiat? Tether is the same, but worst.

You mad bro?

Loved it dude.
Also feel the same way.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:56:30
Honeslty the way BTC is going, I'd rather have fiat. But that's just me.

Oh boy, you will regret this in a few months! But congrats!
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:57:03
Thank you for the link.
As a CPA myself, I can tell you this : 
* This is not an audit
* This was not made for outside parties (i.e. me and you) to read. It was made for internal use, therefore, it doesn't give us any proof at all (read first italic lines).
* Not good 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:35:35
Then investing isn't for you. Stock market is the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:37:11
Oh wow my 10 year old can do that.
Why are you guys excited about high TPS when the market isnt used. This should be considered a good news when the blockchain is used to full capacity. Not now.
I'll take your down vote. Since criticism triggers you. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:42:27
it's been 7 days? holy shit time is passing by so quickly in crypto lmfao
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:10:50
Where is their report? I have never seen one.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:52:10
Do I have any? I don't? But everyone in the market is currently asking Bitfinex to release proof that they are indeed backed by dollars and they **ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING**. So no I don't have evidence, other than the fact that this scam company won't give us a real audit.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:33:26
I didn't buy the top. I got in way under 10k. Nice troll tho

Actually under 5k club so get rekt idiot
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:51:45
I'm not worried about the CME exchange I am worried about the whales that bought the short contracts at 19.5k and that will dump everything tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:30:54
What if I told you that this is not impressive at all at the current time? We need that when the netwrok is beeing used. Not now, when it not used that much. 
The whole market is ''empty'' right now. ETH has 2k unconfirmed tx, it had like 30K last week. All the market is slow currently so this is not impressive at all. We needed those fees last week, not now.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:33:25
I fapped
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:59:58
HAHa im not even going to teach you how it's done. You should educate yourself. Have fun learning 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:26:25
Actually seems like you are the one that took a loan to invest 19.5k because your sorry ass job doesn't pay you well enough fuck off
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:02:02
If I say I audit my 20 tons of gold woud that be enough for you to believe me? Of course not. We need and indepdant report. Why are they not relasing anything?

19.5 to 10.
Stable? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:08:17
Yea we can't. It's sad that I have no solution. Hope someone will come up with one. This post could spark something you never know. At least I am aware of the problem. Some are not
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:07:14
Wow. You are the blind I am trying to save. Bitcoin went from 19.5k to 10k. Are you mentally stable? Do you not see that the drop was made by whales, shorting and selling their btc to manipulate the price? Sigh
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:34:26
Lol lower buy price than you. I bet you all my holdings. Fuck off idiot
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:42:16
Meltdown? Trying to raise awareness and trying to start a discussion? Meltdown? Go play with your lambo... Oh sorry you didn't get one. Maybe next year. Gtfo with your 100$ investment 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:53:22
You don't fear that people that bought at 19k could manipulate the market so they don't lose their money?
Or the opposite if they shorted it?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:46:42
People need to tag pewdiepie so he can speak about btc on his channel

This is not a report.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:06:01
You are kidding right? Don't be so foolish. If i want to send you bitcoin for a service we need a price to make a transaction. If we don't have one we can't transact. Don't say 1 btc = 1 btc, because it doesn't work like that (i can look at the prices to see if the trade is fair) 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:11:05
I know. Your post doesn't take into account that many weak hands are in the market. Also we are in a bear market. Your analysis also makes an assumption that people will buy IF it goes lower and that's maybe not true.
I respect your view. Only time will tell :P
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:51:33
Well people that buy Tether are just dumb. How can I be spreading FUD on a coin that is supposed to stay at 1$ ? I'm trying to find a solution. This will impact the whole market, not only 1 coin, like the Bitconnect scam. The whole market uses Tether.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:31:25
You can pay, go train and hope your tx is confirmed when you are done. Awesome!

@_date: 2018-01-20 22:17:10
Dude this link you are sending is not worth shit.
Unless Friedman LLP. releases an actual report with an official letter and officially signed, Tether is a scam.
What you are showing us is nothing. Just words. We need Friedman LLP. to release the report.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:59:34
Why would I get buried? Because people don't care? All they want is gains?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:10
it's called a short.
Step 1 : don't short crypto.

Glad people are smart. Keep it up
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:47:35
So my next question to you is : is the current price of Btc based on our exchanhes or on the futures? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:38:03
that makes you look even more like a fckn pussy hahaha poor dude ^

Thx for nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:23:04
If you actually report the gains you are stupid. 
I treat BTC as a currency. 
EXAMPLE : I am a canadian. I bought 100$ USD back when CAD and USD were 1:1. 
* Let's say I got buy a steak at walmart and I use my USD. 
* Cashier tell's me to pay 13$ CAD. 
* I pay $ 10 USD (rate is currently 1.3). 
* Do you really think I am going to report my 3$ gain? HAHAHA. Anyone saying they actually report that kind of gain are either lying or stupid.
Down vote all you want you sheeps :)
Your downvotes won't censor me :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:12:22
But that 19 500 is the current price + room to grow right? Idk if I get it
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:49:00
No one knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:13
no they are not....
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:42:08
I will try to explain this to you in easy terms :).
Bitcoin has many issues (scalling, fees ...) and people debate and try to find the best solutions to make Bitcoin the best it can possibly be.
Sometimes people don't agree on the same points and sometimes they do. When they don't however the people that disagree ''leave the Bitcoin (original)'' to go and make a new version of Bitcoin. This is called a fork. In other terms a forks happens when people don't agree on certain aspects of the Bitcoin protocol. 
This happened in August with Bitcoin Cash. The people that did not agree with the original Bitcoin left it and created a coin that had the features they wanted. 
The webiste you are talking about is the website of Bitcoin Cash and that is why it's not the real Bitcoin website.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:21:15
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:45
LOL was gonna say that! Did not think anyone would know it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:51:39
Last trade that happened on Bittrex, Coinbase etc... Right?
Cuz it sure does look like the other way around 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:49:14
The difficulty and the amount of transactions on the network dictate the price of the fees (if you pay more your transaction gets mined faster). See this site : 
Also, Bitcoin is currently trying to fix those high fees. I would suggest you use ETH if you want to transfert to your binance account (less fees). You can then buy your BTC on Binance when you receive the ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:29:51
Why so you say if you can bend it its too thin? Why is it too thin? It won't last in case of fire? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:02:27
So let's say I go on CME website now. If BTC is at 19k and I see a sell order for 19 500 (the 500 is the room to grow) for Jan. Let's say I want to buy that order. Now I have a contract that is telling me that I will buy for 19 500 at Jan (i know it can be cash settled). Right? So this means when you sign a futures contract you are buying the asset at its current value expecting it to grow/dip. You can't speculate on its future price (like saying it will be worth 100k).
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:52
But...that is unacceptable.....
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:41
Yea downvote me. You can't handle the truth

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:30
True. But don't forget that BTC is king.
I've seen many time BTC go down and ALTs also go down with it.
A BTC crash could pour money in ALTs and ETH but you never really know.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:31:35
Unless you bought a fckn lambo how the hell will the IRS even know about the transaction? Don't listen to me, I am just sharing my logic on the situation.
Also. How crazy is it that this is a unregulated, decentralized currency. If you lost your coins or private keys the IRS can't do shit for you but they will gladly take taxes. You took a huge risk investing in crypto. Don't forget that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:02:59

Wait for monday.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:44:12
I don't see why you are nervous?
Add a new word and attach it to a new pin.
After that you have 2 pins.
Pin  unlocks your 24 words wallet
Pin  unlocks your 25 words wallet
You get 2 set of wallets. If you are still nervous, send a small amout to wallet  (25 words) and wipe the device. Try the recovery process. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:21

what a wuss
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:29:03
The fact that the price is at 6 000 determined this was lie.

Why the hell does the orange line look like it's in 3D on my phone? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:23:58
2 people make a contract that they sign. Let's say the contract is for 1 BTC.
Person A will sign the contract saying : I will buy 1 BTC for 4 000 $ in 1 month.
Person B will sign the contract saying : I wil sell 1 BTC for 4 000$ in 1 month.
1 month later BTC is worth 6 000$.
Person B was shorting BTC because they thought the value would be lower than 4 000$. Therefor in the head of a shorter, BTC could be worth 3 000$ at the end of the contract. They would sell it for 4 000$ and make a 1 000$ profit. In this example, that did not happen. Person B would actually lose money, 2 000$ to be exact since they have to sell 1 BTC for 4 000$ when it is worth 6 000$.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:30:03
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:57:58
Nice advice. But the last point is not true. Reaching 100k or 250k doesn't mean that the prevailing regime has fallen. One does not imply the other. BTC can reach this price and have the current regime still running.

With a separate pin, someone could still steal me with my 24 words. Sites like MEW don't use pins. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:47:39
This explanation applies for the temporary passphrase option right? Because in the pin attach this doesn't seem to apply. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:13:51
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:43:38
You know what? I don't have to follow anything. If you don't like my vibe just GTFO. You can't tell me what to do. So just leave. Guess what? I posted before and I'll post AFTER we reach 9k. So take your salty ass back to wherever it came from and never bring your negativity here again. Unreal. Some people really are deluded.

1 thing. It's Bitcoin. Not BitCoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:54


I don't plan on storing the passphrase anywhere other than my head. I will use something that I will remember. That way, I am 100% sure no one but knows what the last word is.

Thank you for the kind words
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:04:53
And in case of a fire?
Thanks for your help but on the Ledger site it's says it's better to never back it up. Don't need to go all crazy. A hard password will be great.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:32:37
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:14:58
So at the end of the day I have 2 pins right?
My main pin that is a normal wallet and my second pin that will show the actual wallet.
My question to you is : in case of a recovery situation where do I input the pin? I don't think you can put it on MEW. I think I understand. When you add a passphrase, the ledger will associate your new PIN with that passphrase. So lets say my passphrase is DOGS. And I want 0000 for a pin. Ledger now makes it easy for me to access my hidden wallet because it understand that if I put 0000 i want to access my 25 words seed and not my 24 words seed.
If i ever wanted to recover my crypto I would put my 24 words seed + DOGS. Since pins aren't used for recovery.

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:11:18
You must be new here
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:26:26
More like 1k but ok babe
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:46:16
Litterally no one is using it. Check the TX numbers. Are you dumb?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:05:49
-cries in crypyo- 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:42:59
Fuck you and your FUD
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:18:36
What if bitcoin is Jesus? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:17:52
Nope. Not happening 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:44:43
Trezor is even worst
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:48:00
How can you verify thr integrity of an adress tho? I don't think you can. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:04:22
You're not 16? Can't use it sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:52:19
DEF THE SAME..
6/10 shitpost fuck op
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:23:07
One of the WORST exchanges. You will get ripped off if you are new.
The trading UI is bad and confusing.
Buy a ledger nano s. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:05:40
Thanks you for your response. I was thinking that I had to chose what coin I wanted prior to the fork. If both upcoming forks are like the one in August I guess leaving it in my Ledger nano s will be fine?
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:43:08
Satoshi of course ��
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:31:09
I am also a CPA and I love crypto. Don't let that ass ruin our title. BTC TO 100K
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:20:38
Check the description 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:11:06
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:36:49
Thank you for the reposted shitpost -_-
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:08:35
Thank you for your reply. Idk why I was thinking I had to chose between original BTC and 2x. Do you know if Ledger nano S is supporting both forks?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:41:03
�� �� 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:09:42
Thank you. You guys only say Hodl when it's at the ath. The moment it drops 1k in value you all sell. Fuck you
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:38:08
Just leave then. Hodl, hodl and hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:45:41
But what if I told you i doesn't matter? What if I told you this needs to happen when a lot of people are using the blockchain to actually be impressive?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:50:50
Great idea
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:46:00
Lmfao i was waiting for this comment haha im crying 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:26:14
Only 1 by that time! Haahah
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:38:38
If only this could be true when people are using the blockchain. It's pretty useless now
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:34:51
Pyramid? Lmfao you are a fckn idiot. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:07:10
The feeling I have when people share my video is insane. Thx for your support. Really nice to see people enjoying my work :) IT'S OVER 9000!
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:27:01






I actually like it.
Im talking about the new comers and mainstream people.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:44:04
Nope this is false. 2 nanos can have the private keys on it. Your nano could be infected and you would never know in that case
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:33:43
Bottom of the page
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:17:54
What will happen in the futur? The current confirmation time is actually insane. I thought Segwit would fix that. Currently it just lowered the fees. Is there anything in the futur that will make transactions confirm faster?
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:18:14
Some virus exist that change the adress when you paste it in. So no, you are not crazy. This is a must.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:34:23
That's hilarious 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:23:41
I think you don't.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:45:55
I disagree with you. Banks litteraly have unlimited amout of cash. They own the system and can litteraly create infinite amout of money. The rise in price would not matter to them. If BTC and other cryptos represent a danger to their system they will buy them all.
If the price increases, people will sell and they will keep buying.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:13:06
really hard to find info on EOS for some reason. Still raised more than 600 000 ETH in 5 days so I can't think it's a shit coin. Information is hard to find. That's why I made a ROI of 58% in 1 day :) and still going strong
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:47:13
My point is : If BTC is a treat to them, they will buy and not care about the value of it. It will be like an expense for them. An expense that is needed to keep the current system in place.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:18:33
What is someone has access to my computer via keylogger? Also any safe wallets for ETH?
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:52:36
Thank you. Changing the last number of the Derivation path to 1 instead of 0 worked fine!
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:43:44
They have unlimited amount of cash. Do you understand that?
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:01:40
Why is this immoral tho or wrong? I dont get it. Enlight me
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:23:51
I agree with you on this.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:48:53
Dude, they won't take mine either.
Don't say they won't be able to afford it. They always will be able. They have infinite cash, litteraly. 
Price going up so fast would make people sell. Making more and more coins available on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:32:28
Go cry in your corner, child. I made 98% return now. If you cant handle the heat dont step in the kitchen. This is free money, if you dont want it fuck off. If you do want it then hop on the gains train. Seriously why u mad?
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:37:58
Yea they will restock early june
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:51:05
Whats that?
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:12:27
I got a Ledger nano S. It has more cryptos suppoted and it looks like their team will be working harder on adding new ones in the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:58:10
I will be hidding it somewhere kinda hard to find and only tell my partners/non tech savy mom where it is in case I vanish.
You can't expect people telling you where they hide them LOL. I like your idea tho. A good hiding place is in the inside a false wall outlet : 
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:38:14
Thats what they told me and thats how it was advertised
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:10:01
ty all for the answers
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:35:02
Really? How long till the last block is mined? 100 years?
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:15:59
To control it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:53:25
The cringeeeee
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:32:30
But the fact that I don't have to know the person makes it easier in my head. I don't have to guess JOEs seed. I can just try to guess anyones seed.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:01:17
What numbers are we talking about? 2^256?
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:57:57
I get your point.
In my head, I think someone should cash out @ 3000$. Hold the capital and reinvest when the price drops. But that is easier said than done.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:51:37
Invest in a hardwallet and you have to pay fees, no choice
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:17:03
WTF? On their site it says ETH is supported. I got the Legder since it has BTC, ETH and STRAT aka the coin in interested in.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:25:41
How dumb is that statement? You're just doing like everyone and saying HODL because of the meme. You are not even trying to understand. Sheep. Some one who bought at 0,40 and sold at 1000$ a few years and bought again at 200 and sold at todays price (3000) made money than someone who HODL that 0,4 coin.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:00:15
How come? How many seeds is there?
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:31:41
Oh. But thats in such a long time
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:31:02
1. It's really hard to understand loool. I don't get it. It can't be that hard to guess a used 24 word seed if you don't need a pin to associate it with someone. How I look at it is it's like a email. It's just a matter of time before someone guesses your ''email''. Why not add an extra layer of protection and use a pin/password. It would increase the security by a lot.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:54:26
you can invest less, but i was just posting the ''best'' scenario
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:33:22
Fuck kraken i swear to god. Fck kraken haven't been verified its been 2 weeks and now this?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:55:45
sorry, but isn't a bitcoin transaction irreversible?
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:06:07
If they are authorized resellers can they somehow get my private key?
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:30:37
Ledgers software can detect if someone tempered with the device. Idk how. But if someone did, the first time you connect to your pc you wont be able to use it.
