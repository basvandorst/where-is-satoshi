A CEO's job is to manage a team and lead a business to profitability. Actions taken for personal reasons which the CEO knows might harm the business, customer adoption, or share price can lead to personal fiscal liability and even criminal liability. This isn't a game for beginners. People get fucking *ruined* over shit like this.

What I hear is "We will not follow Satoshi's vision for bitcoin. We'd rather sell out to the bankers."
So, I'll be boycotting Samurai.

Sammurria is not self-owned by their CEO with 100% share ownership. Moron.

You're a dumbass who obviously doesn't own any startup stock. Outsider who doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:29:13


lol. That's some stupid-ass bullshit right there.


That stops being true the moment you sign founder's share agreements and / or investor stock certificates. That's why people have lawyers review such things.

You sound like a lawyer for Enron, lol. Startups routinely get sued into oblivion. Samurrrreye is begging for it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:19:16
You are beyond the point of salvaging any respect I ever had in your opinion, dunce.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:36:25
Good way to alienate your users. I would not be happy as an investor.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:23:57
I'm only an asshole to morons talking idiotic bullshit like you. And I have tons of reddit accounts. All with unique IP addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:37:41
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Wait, wait. Let me laugh even harder. Let's take this beat-up station-wagon to the MOOOOOOOOOON. lol

Unless all the stakeholders agree that this business is not a money-making venture, he would be acting in bad faith even if he was majority shareholder. That would make it a 501c3, though, not a for-profit business with investors. I doubt that's the case.

They still don't get it. Cryptocurrency means the end of fiat government, not just banking.

user comments:
"I was banned for calling the moderator a hypocrite. literally."
Can we get a list of all the people banned by and along with the purported reason for banning? I think we have a case of censor-mods run wild over there.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:58:38
Mod logs of are CENSORED to remove bannings. LOL
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:40:47
When one of the rules you must not break is "excessive profanity", and people are complaining of being banned for simple criticism of the mods over there, I think it's time for you to reconsider. It's censorship. They are banning anything and anyone they don't like, any making up excuses for why. They are giant hypocrites and I cringe every time there is a feelgood post about how uncensored their sub is, because it's a complete and utter falsehood. You hearing me @_date: 2017-09-30 19:24:58
People need to stop using JAXX. Major SECURITY vulnerabilities in the software that the devs have been told about and REFUSED to address. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses by users that we know of so far.

The same people who bailed out Greece, right? I'm so glad that they are finally all at the same big happy table with us in the new "blockchain" industry. Let's all forget about that whole "bitcoin" thing now, OK?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:18:35
This sub is an amazing display of delusion and projection. Bitcoin is not longer what was described in Satoshi's whitepaper. Bitcoin is a scam these days, because the core turned it into a central banking platform.

Andreas is a scummy sellout for segwit.
