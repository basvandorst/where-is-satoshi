We have many more exchanges than any other index out there. For instance we are the only ones including Chinese exchanges, which are responsible for 94% of the volume.

They're very far away from their stated objective of 10,000,000 wallets at the end of 2014.

very good advice, thanks.

At the same time (during their hack), I provided my documentation and they said yes.

Awesome. I'll try to fit some of this in, but will certainly keep it mind for the questions and discussions that will take place afterwards.

This is indeed a very important point that I have found these people value a lot.

unfortunately game theory would dictate the opposite, and is supported by the facts: There are probably between 100 and 1000x more bitcoin holders than full nodes.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:37:15
You're delusional if you think mainstream people will do that.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:02:40
It depends how you define the death of bitcoin. If it becomes like Tor, as in 99.99999% of the planet doesn't use it, then it's dead.
Bitcoin has long had a huge PR problem since there is no central authority behind it. It's time the big central actors acknowledge that responsibility for PR (it's in their interest) and step the fuck up. We need them until we get to a fully decentralized infrastructure, which will take years if not decades.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:10:17
Some very good comparisons here. My only gripe: bitcoins aren't created out of thin air, you have to spend electricity to produce them!
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:46:01
so true
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:46:22
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:35:05
Duly noted about giving them solid resources. Donating bitcoins might be logistically difficult. I agree that owning bitcoin makes it easier to learn though.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:32:48
You guys have not been through 2011 when every exchange lost all their coins but Gox. It's easy to point the finger when all you have is recent history. For those of us that have been on Gox since almost the beginning, it's much more difficult. They had until last month the longest track record of not screwing their customers.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:30:22
I think it's even safe to say he'll gamble again.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:48:55
They might, but the cat being out of the bag anyway, I don't think it's productive to obfuscate that point. I think the more we educate them and establish a dialog, the smoother the transition will be. Also keep in mind smart incumbents could definitely adopt Bitcoin.

Have you had success with that? In my experience that non-technical people feel belittled when you tell them, "hey it's math and crypto, don't question it". They don't really trust that kind of statement that elevates math (and more generally science) to god status. The fact that it's math doesn't mean it needn't be explained. Unfortunately that takes a lot more than 10min.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:01:17
It's stated on this public page that has existed for some time now (at least a month)

Buying bitcoins at an exchange is hard if you don't have a fiat balance sitting there, meaning it's not earning interest. Plus if you want to buy instantly then you pay the spread, which can be pretty high at times.
The only way it works is if you're willing to wait for the deposit time to an exchange. But that's pretty inconvenient.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:31:12
Nobody knows exactly how much inflation there was, that's the whole point and why the government can do that with total impunity.
And anyone buying bitcoin at $1 won way more than keeping it greenbacks. It's easy to pick the highest point in history.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:45:46
That's completely wrong. See

Wow, what a great story. Love your examples and casual tone. Thank you very much. However, can you elaborate on this point:
"Have you ever lost your wallet or had it stolen? Did you lose any cash? Did you have to wait days to receive a new credit card? If you ever have your Bitcoin wallet stolen, it is not only possible, but very probable that you can still recover your funds."
I'm pretty sure the opposite is true, so I'm curious how you would recover funds from a stolen wallet.

Yes I definitely agree that showing big names and companies is important to provide some kind of social proof.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:46:23
That argument only works when you never hold bitcoins and use it as pure conduit for payment, meaning you buy bitcoins and pay with them instantaneously. I don't think that's currently doable for most people.

Austrian economics were never experimented with. That's a shame. You're right that reality economics are not austrian. But that's because people are not free to try. Bitcoin might provide a window of hope for those who would like to try.
@_date: 2014-07-30 08:08:22
Writing a book is like talking. There are already thousands of blogs. And the Bitcoin wiki was written in large part by Mike Hearn. The fact that Newegg, Tigerdirect and Dell accept Bitcoin is in no way due to Roger, but rather to Bitpay and Coinbase.
I'm not saying they don't play an important role, but their contribution is so much smaller than the size of their fame.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:46:57
The reason why it takes a few weeks is because real banks take a few weeks to wire money internationally. Get out of your US bubble with ACH transfers jeez.
It has always been this way with banks and that will never change. Gox has nothing to do with it. Online poker sites and money transmitting services like Moneybookers or Neteller were the same.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:51:33
good story. Also good idea to show coinmap.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:11:10
Sure but the most important thing is non-transferrable: proof-of-work. That's why Bitcoin is valuable. Not because you can tip on reddit. Proof-of-work in altcoins is basically hot air as the network of miners is so small.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:44:10
we'll just have to agree to disagree. I like austrian economics. Classical economics don't make sense to me.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:36:50
Point me to a service where you can instantaneously buy and spend bitcoins, without immobilizing any fiat balance, without limits or delays or other inconveniences.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:43:48
No it's much more casual than the US hearings. Also I don't really agree that no technical know how is required. You need to know how to safely store a password/private key, and use 2FA. A ton of people have no idea what 2FA even is.

Do you mind telling me who you are? (privately if you want)

That's a problem with US banks, not Mtgox.

Hi, 3 questions:
1. How do you think of incentivizing full-nodes? Is that even something desirable?
2. What do you think about Ben Laurie's [thesis]( that Bitcoin is way too expensive? 
3. A lot has been said and written about ECDSA, but very little about the really interesting and innovative part of bitcoin: the consensus protocol and code. Where can one learn about how it really works and what are its weaknesses except in the source code?
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:19:38

@_date: 2014-04-08 15:22:34
The faster Bitcoin goes to meteoric valuation the faster the price will stabilize. It's not until we gain one or 2 orders of magnitude more that the price can be stable while supporting huge volume of transactions. Right now by selling a single house you can move the price by 1%. That's unacceptable. 
He is just stating the obvious. Of course most people are in for the potential gains, that's how investments work. Without people in for the quick buck Bitcoin would've never taken off so quit crying about these damn speculators.

Stop saying that. Non-USD withdrawals take 2-3 weeks. Mtgox is not an ordinary bank. Not even a bank actually.

@_date: 2014-07-29 09:44:02
Are you kidding me? All Erik, Roger and Andreas do is talk. They do it rather well and have amassed a pretty amazing libertarian following, but their legacy and role is nowhere near as important as that of Mike Hearn. Without him, Bitcoin-related software would've never taken off. Mike has the courage of asking real questions and playing devil's advocate.

Well a little googling could've probably done the trick, but here's who I am: 
I'm making this presentation because I'm the most knowledgeable guy about Bitcoin in the network of the host.

@_date: 2014-05-12 13:43:49
You're delusional if you think you don't leak personal info when you buy online with bitcoins. Heck, even if you go online and don't buy anything. If you want anonymity, don't go online, get paid in cash and pay in cash.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:41:03
Great ideas, thanks. I definitely won't have time to talk about all of this, but certainly will pick a few of them, like    would require more time I'm afraid.
This isn't really a talk about regulation, so I don't think I'll talk about  or 
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:02:33
28btc total spread in 1-9btc transactions still stuck (not refunded)
EDIT (12 hours later): have now been refunded 25btc. unsure if that's what I was missing or if I still have 3btc stuck. Will do my accounting later.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:42:32
Well put, especially like your 5 bullets.
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:03:03
It's actually kind of both. I roughly know what to say, but was interested in what the most important points should be considering the context.
It's not the first time I'm giving a presentation, I've pitched my previous company to audiences of a hundred people, but I'm certainly not an expert at this, so I'm definitely hungry for advice on this topic.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:29:53
This is more or less the way I do it now. Bitcoins are nowhere near widespread enough (especially in France) or stable to be called money right now. It is a means of exchange, but not money.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:09:18
Love Fred, he actually puts his mouth where his money is, unlike many investors.

I don't really know why. I just see the facts. Every country has its ups and downs, hopefully France can get its shit together.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:29:34
What's inaccurate? Yeah, they were hacked, but nobody lost coins. They paid some of the lost coins from their own pockets. What exchange from that period is still standing? (ok maybe btc-e existed but it had no volume then and is still shady as shit) Tradehill was the biggest contender and went belly-up.
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:21:33
No it is private. I'm 100% sure there will only be a few senators, I don't know exactly who though.

can you say more?
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:19:10
It could bot be made to work so far, perhaps because we didn't have the necessary technology. Bitcoin and the blockchain technology might be the solution. That's why I'm excited about it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:36:46
that won't be a problem :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:35:49
This is along the lines of what I had in mind.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:21:07
ok makes sense
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:28:08
I can't wait until the dogechain and other altchains get attacked and fail into oblivion. People are vastly underestimating what kind of work and tears went into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:39:03
What methods of incentivizing non-mining full nodes have been thought of and what are their trade-offs?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:56:41
While those benefits are real, they are not felt in France, whose banks are actually pretty solid and available to the vast majority of citizens. 
Your second point holds true.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:42:05
then I'm guessing you're calling btc-e a disaster? their support is even worse than gox's
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:49:19
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:44:41
Because it is not true.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:29:22
As long as there is a 100% return to be made, I don't see why people should stop buying on MtGox. Once everything goes back to normal I will for sure withdraw my bitcoins that are stuck there. But in the mean time, there is money to be made. That's the only lesson: people will make money when they can.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:49:21
Yes, that was known a while ago. I'm even very surprised that gmaxwell/nullc didn't know it. It was publicly explained on 
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:45:50
Gee, I never thought of that.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:38:01
This is a mishmash of people with wildly different agendas. My talk is part of an evening that is more broadly about innovation and won't only be about Bitcoin or finance.
I was invited because "I know a guy who knows a guy", I've written in the French press about Bitcoin and I know a lot about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:15:17
Exactly. It will be all to easy for governments and banks to issue press releases saying "we told you so". The people will trust them.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:44:58
Thanks for the reply, you make some great points! I think autonomous agents are likely out of scope for this talk. But hopefully I'll get to talk about them afterwards.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:05:04
Great stuff, thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:41:05
Haha that video is pretty funny.
I've watched most of Andreas' talks, but they're usually much longer than 10min, which is why I'm asking for help here. Also, I feel Andreas' audiences (at least in the talks that were taped) were pretty different from the one I'll have.
Good advice, thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:13:51
The ledger actually was violated once in the very early days (I think 2010), but the problem was solved quickly.
Apart from that, it's indeed a good framework to build on, thank you.

That is definitely something I want to convey.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:56:27
Good points. I like how you describe mining, very simple. From my experience though, they will ask, so I might as well briefly go over it. People want to understand where that money comes from. Gold comes from the earth, fiat comes from a central bank, bitcoins come from a distributed and open-source transaction verification algorithm.
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:51:37

That's a great article indeed. I've read it before, but will go through it again and see if it might fit in 7min (but I have some doubts).
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:05:52
Inflation can be defined as the increase in the stock of money. The USD stock has quadrupled in the last 5 years. Sure prices have not increased but this is hidden by debts that have piled up. Government debt is way past dangerous levels, and soon it will all tumble like the house of cards it really is.

Right, I actually misread the first time and confused stolen wallet with stolen bitcoins. Of course a lost or stolen wallet is not a problem if you still have the private key. Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:01:48
I'll keep those in mind, unsure if I'll be able to fit them in though.

One thing I agree with is "A basis of any working economy is a steady and predictable level of change, which is what BTC never had and doesn't seem to be getting any time soon."
BTC is still very immature, but it holds amazing promise. Give it time.

The first two points are great, the rest is out of scope I'd think.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:39:57
That's a pretty good summary indeed, although very dense. I don't think you can hope that people understand it right away without any previous exposure to Bitcoin.

thanks, will check it out.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:31:52
Not self-bashing, just acknowledging reality. The French establishment is very wary of innovation (not only Bitcoin). Think Uber vs taxis, limitations on DNA sequencing, etc
Other than that, good points.

Like I said, Gox might be insolvent. There are some good arguments for it. I was just stating that the comparison to FTP was really bad. That whole article is just plain bad tabloid quality content that tries to sound smart but really fails for anyone with a pulse.

curious, where are you withdrawing to?
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:58:53
Yes you did but you don't realize it. Since they had to print money to bail out banks, there was inflation. With inflation you lost some buying power. So sure you got the same amount of money, but you lost wealth.
Also, madoff victims didn't get their money back.

My theory is this: people who criticize MtGox victims are people who got in pretty late, like after April 2013, and did a lot of research before purchasing their 0.1 btc and putting it into cold storage.
That's because they are by definition not early adopters, so they are more wary and less trustful, whereas early adopters are obviously much more naive, which makes them early adopters, and which is why they had hundreds or even thousands of bitcoins on mtgox.
So to all the self-righteous laggard early-adopters who don't hold more than 10btc and are calling mtgox victims stupid: fuck you.

Each node can have (and probably has) a different mempool. It depends on your mempool policy and when you started your node. Long-running nodes with a lot of RAM probably have mempools that are much larger than 38mb, stock full with old unconfirmed transactions as there is no automatic cleaning of the mempool in Bitcoin Core. We (Kaiko) accept every Bitcoin transaction that we receive, and restart our node every time the mempool fills up our RAM. 
Also, the goal of our chart is to display Bitcoin throughput visually. For this reason we do not show the real number, as a 38mb mempool would completely flatten the curve and render the chart useless.
You are right that this can be misleading to users though, and we will explain it on our site.

why do you assume that you have to rebuy electricity ? You could have excess electricity and need oil or gas. Bitcoin becomes a convenient way to swap both.

Heh sorry I didn't mean to imply anything about you. What I wanted to point out, is the recent tendency to elevate math, and more generally science, to the status of deity. You can see that when people say things like "because science" or "because math". 
And yes, in that sense, I thought your little photoshop was misleading. I have a grad school education in pure mathematics, but most people don't, and that formula could as well read God to them, they wouldn't know the difference.
The fact of the matter is that I don't think that kind of comparison helps Bitcoin at all, because it doesn't help people understand any of it, and is more inclined to manipulate than to educate. Bitcoin relies heavily on strong cryptography, but even more on strong economic incentives. Without these incentives, all the math in the world won't save it.
I guess I'm just a little tired of that very simplistic assertion that Bitcoin having math at its core makes it better than other money. It doesn't.
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:46:45
When you elevate Math to the status of God, both become indistinguishable. You just ask people to blindly trust something they don't understand. In the case of Bitcoin, the math is far too complex for the vast majority of people to even try to understand.
So lets just stop asking people to blindly follow something and just make products people want.

jesus, such panic, and I was commuting while this happened. Missed a 20-30% gain in BTC. Oh well. The sellers below 1000 will be ridiculed in a few weeks (might even be days if we recover as fast as the SR crash)

this is exactly the kind of things you should keep to yourself. Mainstream people will never touch bitcoin if they risk seeing a SWAT team sent to their homes. If the bitcoin community keeps spouting that kind of aggressive anarchist message, bitcoin will always stay at the fringe and will never reach mass adoption. Mainstream people need banks and guarantees. They want them. Even if the currency is bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:22:57
Finally a sensible and well thought out article about Bitcoin in the mainstream press. This is huge.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:09:35
Even though that's true, we need to stop marketing ourselves as an enemy of the state and banks or we will NEVER go mainstream. We need a positive message now more than ever.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:20:20
But we will never get the general public to understand the banking system. We're hurting ourselves by framing bitcoin as this subversive anarchist anti-establishment weapon. We should only be talking in positive terms and focus on tangible and understandable benefits for people, such as ease of transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:18:28
While you think that and most early adopters, including myself, think that, this is the opposite of what most people think. So stop spreading that message.

I welcome the initiative but really you need to either hire a designer or learn about the display of visual information (you can start here:  and then look up  Edward Tufte). Currently your design is all over the place and makes it really hard to know what to do on your site.

Wow that thread is so filled with negativity I'm taken aback. So much ignorance and so many fallacies. This goes to show how far far far away from mainstream we are and how the vast majority of the population still mocks it as toy/scam/whatever. The bitcoin community has a ton of work to do to better its image and communicate its message like a mature company/non-profit would.

50btc is "only" about 50-60k, it's not that much money. Some people are trading with much bigger amounts.

You missed the most important part of my statement there. I'm just saying that amid all that FUD shrouded in negativity that's spouted by most of the mainstream media about bitcoin recently this is a welcome breath of fresh air.
