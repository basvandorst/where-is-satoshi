That's true. In most cases "everyone" is not the correct term to use. I tend to use it if I think that &gt;95% fit the statement. But wouldn't you agree that the remaining people who  don't know (yet) that r/btc is about bch will figure out pretty quick that it is indeed about bch? It takes a normal person probably 5 min max. I just can't see how that is deceitful.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:57:44
Oh I'll be back. Don't you worry.

You have any proof that any government even owns btc?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:09:02
He did the opposite. So where is the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:46:26
I just gave you 1 karma with an upvote for your post. Your welcome!
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:02:27
Not a problem. Bitcoin loses more and more merchants. Soon enough the mempool will be empty again because nobody uses btc anymore. Then you can open a on channel for low fees. Question is if there are still merchants willing to get back on the train at that time. But look at the bright side, this way there is no blocksize increase needed and btc can stay decentralized. That's the most important thing! Or not?
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:30:28
Why is a 30$ fee highway robbery? Isn't that a normal fee for btc at the moment?

Bcash, bcash, bcash, Roger ver, jihad Wu. That's all you guys talk about while other altcoins will dethrone btc. You people really think that btc is only losing ground because of bch and Roger&amp; Co? Pathetic!
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:55:08
I guess you know that r/btc existed before bch was launched? It has always been a sub for the Bigblockers. Besides that I'm not sure if it is even possible to rename a sub without loosing all subscribers in the process.

How can you use LN at the moment? Are there user friendly applications available already?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:56:31
Then why is Segwit not mandatory? As long as it is possible to use non Segwit txs you can call it sabotage.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:54:43
No need for further discussion. I think we just sit back and see what happens in a few months.

I hope not. But can't be sure with the current mood in the community.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:40:11
It's no secret that r/btc is about bch. Have you tried to post it in r/Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:14:40
If his coins are not already on a Segwit address this won't work. Not very helpful.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:59:53
Last week it was coinbase that was "spamming" the network. Now it's Ver again? Or both at the same time? Maybe some others are also involved? If yes, who are they?

Not very helpful. Why is it a trap?
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:23:10
So now stripe is anti bitcoin? What have they done? Have you ever considered that btc is just not a valid payment option at the moment?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:39:24
That doesn't make sense. Then he has to pay two fees. One to Segwit and then another to exchange. Think again before you post something stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:56:56
Cheap and reliable means fees &lt;20 cents and tx confirmed within &lt;30 min for an extended period of time (not just once a month).
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:00:17
That's because we are paid by Roger and jihad Wu. We get so much money for it you can't even imagine.

No thank you for correcting you? That's a bit rude from you. Now I downvote!
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:16:09
Yeah it's common knowledge that bch fees are higher than btc fees. Always have been and always will be! Right?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:52:22
Wrong. The market doesn't care about efficient use of block space. The market will flush out coins which have a problem with such practices.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:47:44
That makes no sense but ok.

Thanks, I corrected it. Not from an english speaking country. But i guess you got the meaning.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:41:16
So bch supporters are richer than btc supporters? Is this the reason why only the btc chain gets "spammed"?

@_date: 2018-01-06 10:09:38
Sat = Satoshi (smallest denomination of Bitcoin), byte means the size of the transaction which depends on the number of inputs and outputs. And yes the fees are high at the moment therefore btc was rebranded to "store of value". Most btc fans think that the Lightning Network will fix the fee issue when it is released (no eta yet). I'm afraid you have to choose an altcoin if you want to purchase stuff worth less than 1000$ at the moment. Otherwise fees will screw you over.

According to johoe you should expect to pay a fee of 300-500 sat/byte at the moment. A fee of 400 sat/byte can easily add up to &gt;20$. Have you checked the tx Id and do you know what sat/byte coinbase used?
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:11:49
The sources you provided are just rumours. Might as well believe that the recent spike in bch txs were "spam" from blockstream. Nothing but conspiracy theories. Your questionable presentation of those weak sources further confirms it. So I prefer to still be an ass.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:31:21
For sure, question is are they interested? If btc won't win the race then one of the 1000 other crypto currencies would just take it's place. They have other better options to cripple the entire crypto market if they wanted to.

When the split happens in November then there will be two versions of Bitcoin (if you want to include Bitcoin cash, three versions). The first one will be "classic" bitcoin, the second "2x" Bitcoin. There will be around 16.5 million coin of each one (not all 21 million coins have been mined yet). And both can expand to 21 million each. If you have bought your coins before the split happens and if you have the private keys in your possession ( in your own wallet on our own PC) you will have the same number of coins for both coin versions. Let's say you bought 5 bitcoins before the split, then you will have 5 "classic" coins and 5 "2x" coins after the split.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:33:05
If you keep on doing what you do, it will.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:23:16
Both sides claim to be the "real" Bitcoin. This will be the same after the November split. I guess everyone has to decide what he calls Bitcoin and what not. This is just your opinion. Not more not less.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:41:52
Sounds safe to me. If you have bitcoins on an exchange like coinbase than you might not get both coins after the split. That is up to their policy. There were a lot of unhappy people after the Bitcoin cash split who had coins on exchanges and didn't get their Bitcoin cash coins (some not at all, some at a later time).

@_date: 2017-08-24 16:02:00
Yeah right, but a merchant needs to open channels otherwise he can't do business. As soon as he opens a chanel he looses (tx fees) money and freezes funds. So basically he has to check if he wants to allow a customer to interact with him. Doesn't sound very handy.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:22:46
Wouldn't it be possible to attack a merchant? Let's say it is a controversial merchant (selling Nazi stuff, etc...) and a group of 20.000 activists decides to open a channel with this merchant within a few minutes (would not work at the moment because block size too small). That would mean the merchant has to pay 20.000 * 2-4$ tx fees for opening the channel and the same again for closing? Is he supposed to monitor this?

Yes exactly. A and B can send ltc and btc back and forth for many weeks or even months without having an impact on the main chain. But as you said, if the channel closes the transaction will be incorporated into the main chain. That is what "ThatCryptoGuy" said.

@_date: 2017-08-23 03:17:57
I thought the idea was that you can use Bitcoin instead of cash and or credit cards which are both based on the fiat system for everyday purchases. And why has Bitcoin the word coin in it if it doesn't want to replace the fiat based cash system? And why has Bitcoin cash the word cash in it? Just because it has a nice ring to it?

Exactly, their intention is certainly not to protect small investors. They just want to make profit from spreading fear and misinformation. It is sad that these redicioulus predictions even get attention. Everyone should keep in mind: They are not your friend and they will burn down the whole world with a smile on their faces if they could make money out of it. Just look a few years back...
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:36:44
Mate, either you or I (and "ThatCryptoGuy") are getting it wrong. For me it means to hold a Bitcoin that you have the funds on a public address to which you have the private key in your wallet. To my understanding a transfer of btc needs to be incorporated in the block chain. So until something is recorded in the block chain there is no value transfer. It might be on record in a second layer but it is most definitely not btc at this stage. I know you can have smart contracts incorporated in the eth block chain but not in the btc block chain as far as I am aware of. So if you have any further information that can point me to my knowledge gap, I am happy to educate my self. But at this point I can't see how this should really work without a record on the btc block chain (main chain).
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:58:51
It's funny that you say that. The 2x part is highly controversial at the moment. Many people here said it will all be good when Segwit is activated, then the mempool will clear in days. Two weeks ago no one said 30% in 1 year (maybe some Bigblocker). Now Segwit seems to be a bit underwhelming and the next thing you hear is: "Don't worry LN will solve the problem!". LN my ass! Sure it sound promising  but now that we see that even Segwit won't be ready for the mainstream for a few months, no one can tell me that LN will work within weeks .Some people really think it is ok to live with high fees for the next 1.5 years? I really thought Segwit would ease the pain, especially after reading all those discussion. But I won't drink the Kool aid for LN. If 2x won't come through, Bitcoin won't go to the moon. No new user would be stupid enough to pay these fees.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:53:47
But isn't the idea of Bitcoin to replace cash in the future? Wasn't that the whole idea?

@_date: 2017-08-16 14:43:32
I don't understand why people think that LN will solve this problem instantly. Short term it might even make things worse. IF LN really can hold up to its promises it will take many months to ease the pain. In the meantime 2x is needed.

There is just no end and too many unknowns.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:40:38
Why should they try to decrease the btc price. I thought they are heavily invested in btc. They might or might not support bch but they certainly don't want to burn their own money. Do you have any evidence for your claim (e.g. transactions which can be traced back to one of them)?
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:40:24

A working version of Bitcoin or maybe another crypto coin (not the current state) would be superior to cash/debit cards/fiat in almost all aspects. It's the similar to Wikipedia and enceclopedias. If it is far easier, cheaper and flexible to use then will be adopted by the mass.

"I realized that technical analysis didn't work when I turned the chart upside down and didn't get a different answer.”, Warren Buffett. This is of course a joke and it is only his opinion but it captures the  feeling that many people (including myself) have about TAs. I guess the biggest problem is that there are dozens of different TA concepts and only a handful of scientific studies about the effectiveness of some of them (and again no conclusive outcome). So the question is: Why should I use something that has not been proven to be effective? And don't tell me about this one company that made a fortune by using TAs. Could be true or could be an outlier. Until there are hard facts on the table, it is nothing more than a concept of faith. That puts it in the same category of astrology. I can not prove (and nor can anyone else) that the position of the 4. Jupiter moon in 1923 was not the reason why WWII happened. But I have no reason to believe it.

Did these companies/institutions just not sign the agreement or did they explicitly say that they will not participate in 2x. I mean it is obvious for blockstream but I couldn't find anything specific for some of them.

Ok another example: A wants to interact with B. So A and B send 0.1 btc to a transfer channel ( this will result in 2 transaction on chain; one from A and one from B). now A is the customer and B is the coffee shop. A drinks 4 coffee per Day for 0.0025 btc each. This means A's credit is gone after 10 days and the channel is closed between the two ( B gets all 0.2 btc in one transaction; another on chain transaction). So in this simplified example you will have 3 on chain transactions instead of 10. Of course A and B could open a channel with a higher value but this would then lock up more bitcoins (and I think lightning network will limit it anyway to &lt;1 btc per channel). Point is: after some time these channels will close unless you get influx from another channel for example if B and C have a channel open and C wants to send some funds to A. But I would reckon that most people will behave like pure customers and won't have influx from other sources (e.g. buying coffee, groceries). So as soon as A is out of funds he has to open another channel. And I guess at some point (maybe once a  a week or month, B also wants to cash out  to buy new coffee beans and pay rent in fiat. In essence what "ThatCryptoGuy" said is true. You will have on chain transactions! Sure a lot less (if the system is working efficiently) but still. What am I not seeing?

It is a list of "non supporter". That means those companies/institutions have not openly supported 2x. What most people probably think is that they reject 2x (like you also do). For example Bitfinex which is on this list asked to be removed, but so far this hasn't happened yet. This list is nothing more than propaganda.

Bitcoin needs a scaling solution to cope with the increasing number of transactions. There are two groups: Bigblocker and smallblocker. The first group wants to increase the block size, the second wants to use so called 2nd layer scaling. The first split happend 1st Aug and gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (increased block size) and introduced Segwit on the other side of the fork as basis for 2nd layer scaling. Now there is a good possibility for another split on the Segwit coin or just Bitcoin side of the fork in November, that intends to increase the blocksize (read about NYC agreement). Both sides (Bigblocker and smallblocker) accuse each other of intentionally destroying Bitcoin. I hope that was unbiased enough and allows you to build your own opinion through research.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:14:27
Of course it makes sense! And I can imagine even more complicated structures. But the point is: In the end it has to be recorded on the main chain. Otherwise A's btcs are locked-in in a second layer (e.g. lightning network) and are something else but not bitcoin. They are only "safe" when they are transferred to A's account (when the channel closes). And this will happen on the main chain like "ThatCryptoGuy" said.

See this is were you are wrong. If 2x for example gets all the miners and exchanges on their site, then 2x will be called Bitcoin. Same is true for Bitcoin cash and "classic" bitcoin. The winner takes it all. No one will give a shit about some rules you might think define the naming convention. I guess we will see sometime after November.

What is the point of creating an Australian "Bitcoin"? If the government has any control of any part of this coin then it would not even be in the same league as Bitcoin. Just some new version of government controlled cash that is inferior to "true" crypto currencies. And if not, then it is just one of the other 1300 alt coins. This is just completely stupid PR bullshit from some politicians who want to look "young" and "innovativ".
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:31:02
It is clearly misleading. If non supporter  means "just not signed the agreement", I could add Coca-Cola and Toyota and IBM to this list as well. It is even not mentioned if those companies participated in the NYC event and then rejected to sign or if they were not invited or just didn't want to participate.  A list with companies/ institutions which clearly (e.g. statement on website) reject 2x would be honest and informative.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:36:02
Then please explain to me why people even think of Segwit and lightning network. If it is just a commodity/investment then on chain scaling would be more than enough and the only valid idea. Payment channels would be completely crazy for this use case. No one would argue about it. The current discussion is centered around the problem to cope with 50,000 tx per second (Visa scale). And what about the discussion about 0 conf for instant payments? All misguided ideas?

Let's say A sends ltc to B via the lightning network. And somehow the ltc amount gets converted to btc (I guess a mediator will do the conversion). Please correct me if I'm wrong but the final transaction (from the mediator to B) still needs to happen on the main chain? If I were B I would persist that some btc were transferred from some accounts to one of my accounts. Where if not on the main chain will this transaction happen?

Sure they have to scale but the only purpose of the lightning network is to facilitate micro-transactions. If the idea is to use Bitcoin as easy "moveable" gold then LN would be complete utter nonsense. No one would even consider to scale off chain. So obviously a lot of people have a different idea of bitcoin than you have.

@_date: 2017-08-22 10:28:44
So where is the problem? All polls from Luke jr showed overwhelming support for Segwit without 2x. If 90% of the user (as suggested by the polls and most people in r/Bitcoin) stick to Bitcoin the 2x fork will die of rather quickly. Isn't that what was said here for weeks now? I thought the users are the real power behind Bitcoin?

Based on Moore's law we should have 2^7=128 times the capacity now compared to 2010 (when he set the limit). So if Satoshi expected this to be true then he would have been ok with 128 Mb blocks by now, according to you? You said the doubling didn't happen for &gt;2 years , so upper limit is 2^5=32. Even if we had only one quarter of this improvement it should still be enough for an increase from 1Mb -&gt; 8Mb. Am I missing something?

Maybe when that happens Bitcoin is still one of the biggest 5 cryptos. But who cares anyways, it's much more important to keep the block size small. Why not support Luke with his plan to decrease the size to 300 kb. Seems to be a good idea, doesn't it?

Actually I think it's way more likely than winning the lottery. It has been made clear that the miners are hated by this community. That's not a role anyone wants to play. No one should be surprised if the miners do something drastic to overthrow the current regime. I think a lot of people underestimate the power the miners have and also the dissatisfaction on their side. From my visit of Bitcoin Meetups I also know that the community wass not 99% against 2x. Most of the people I met were actually indifferent towards 2x or didn't have such a strong opinion like the people here on Reddit. I think if the miners still really wanted to pull it off they could have a good chance to do it.

Look at the future market (eg  Bt1 is valued at 6300 and Bt2 is valued at 1015. Both combined 7315 which is the current price of btc. If this valuation is correct (which it is probably not) then your 3 bt1 will be worth 18900 and your Bt2 3045. The sum of that is the same value as your 3 btc now (21945). If you now sell your Bt2 immediately and reinvest in bt1 you would have ~3.5 bt1. If a lot of people do the same the bt1 price might climb to ~7315 and then you would have made a profit indeed. But without new people (money) entering the market the combined value of your two coins can't be higher than the current value of your btcs. The fork will only redistribute the current value to the two new chains. If you are lucky and make the correct trades you might profit from the fork (like described above) but it is certainly not "free" money or a dividend like some people call it.

I heard that the Russian government is hording billions of dollars worth of Korean Won. You wonder why? Because they want to secretly buy bch through bithump. As soon as the bch price is higher than the btc price they will dump all their bch. The result will be that btc and bch are both crippled. In the meantime they will launch their own coin. There was a secret meeting with Putin, Ver and Jihan last week in Moscow. An insider told me that Ver and Jihan have already made a deal to trade their bch for the new Russian coin. Basically they have accepted that their China coin is worth nothing and the Russian coin will be the winner. That's the real conspiracy here. Be careful out there. Russia is coming!

@_date: 2017-11-22 07:35:09
Pure speculations. This would only be possible if a large group of miners is willing to mine with losses for an extended period. They could have done it when the mempool was full but didn't. So why now? Do you have any insider information?

@_date: 2017-11-09 14:29:48
So now we are talking. 13 cents. Can't complain about that right? You think you paid too much because coinbase was driving the fees to insane levels with their non Segwit txs?

@_date: 2017-11-09 14:33:26
Not correct. You complained that because of coinbases non Segwit txs you had to pay higher fees. I suggested you yourself should use Segwit to pay lower fees. You just told me you paid 13 cents which is basically nothing. What am I missing here?

Ok, I answer both. I support it because after 2x was cancelled, btc is in fact digital gold. A smaller block size would accelerate the current war. But I don't think that people here will vote for it because most of them seem to like the status quo and would never support a hardfork.

@_date: 2017-11-24 01:40:59
That's not true. Bch can't be more profitable for an extended period of time thanks to the new DA algorithm. The idea is that bch will have an enormous price increase and this will help to get more hash power away from btc permanently. Some even think that some miners will be willing to mine at a loss for awhile. If all of this happens then hash power for btc will drop to 50% or less. The result would be a few slow weeks for btc until btc has the next DA.

@_date: 2018-02-03 02:22:18
Ok if I understand it correctly then Bitcoin is safe because you have the monitor button, right? And for eth you usually use the same address over and over. So if you send a small amount to the eth address initially and then send the same amount back (from exchange to nano and then back from nano to exchange) you should be allright because the nano actually has the private Key to sign the tx and no one else could have it. Is that right?

Thanks for the answer. Was just wondering because in your case the Bitcoin deal "only" gained you ~14% and you have to pay ~1% exchange fee and on top of this taxes. Seems to be a big risk for let's say 8-10% profit after all. Don't get me wrong, you did the right thing but the profit seems a bit small for my taste.

Maybe they think their legal basis is weak for a ban and fear that it could be overthrown by the supreme court. This would open the gates of hell (from their point of view).

Sorry, but you don't understand what bitcoin is about. It is a trust less system compared to the classical bank system that relies on trust. If apple or Google release their own coin or P2P system then it is also based on trust. Maybe that is not important for you but it is for a lot of people. For every person who calls bitcoin a scam there is another one who thinks it is the payment system of the future ( and not just freaks on Reddit but people like Gates and Wozniak) . If you don't think so? Fine. Remember that a lot of people also thought that the internet will only be used by paedophiles and other criminals.

I think the verdict is still not clear on Hitler's religious believes. In my opinion he only acknowledge God (or a higher being) in public in order to keep the common people on his side. But anyway...
Here is the difference between you and me: you need a higher authority who either praises you for doing good or punishes you for doing bad. You look for a meaning where there is nothing to look for. Moral behavior is just a gift from Mother Nature to keep a species alive. Your conclusion that there has to be a God because otherwise everything is just pointless is just the easy way out.

I hear from people all the time: "4600 is too much. I want at least 1 coin". It's hard for me to understand this reasoning but it seems like a lot of people don't like buying a fraction of a bitcoin (or things in general). Although it makes no logical sense it might help to get people on board. Therefore: YES!

Look Hodlers believe you should never sell (unless you want to cash out for good to buy stuff). Of course if you know/ have a strong feeling that the market will drop you should sell, but then your not a HODLER! Good movie by the way.

They can't kill Bitcoin but they can make it very hard to use. If shops are not allowed to accept cryptos and exchanges are not allowed to trade, the btc price would take a big hit (see China). Especially if a country like USA or Japan would ban cryptos. Question is: will they do it?

Makes sense but if you visited cryptocompare.com in the last few days and looked at the usd toplist you would have seen that Bitcoin went up (green) compared to usd and most other cryptos went down (red; except for neo). Wasn't very significant though. Before that most of the time all cryptos went up/down (all green/ all red) together compared to usd (some of course more than others). I guess the OP is referring to this?

You are missing the point here. Banks might catch up with Bitcoin when you look at transaction speed and fees (in fact btc fees are not very attractive at the moment). But at least for me and probably many others it is important to get rid of the middle man (the banks). Many people distrust banks, a few even hate them. So if Bitcoin can offer a working scaling solution, I would strongly prefer Bitcoin over banks for P2P payments. And of course the Bitcoin journey has just started so we will see solutions that are more convenient for mainstream use.

Coinbase, coinjar and btcmarkets are all good. Coinbase has a limit of 400 AUD per week for new customers and no option for bank deposits. Btcmarkets has POLi pay as standard deposit option. Stay away from POLi!!! But you can ask btcmarkets support to unlock the direct bank deposit option. Coinjar has bank deposit option as standard. Coinbase and coinjar are very easy to use (compared to btcmarkets) but have slightly higher fees than btcmarkets.

Tether claims that every tether coin is backed 1:1 by a real usd. So it should appreciate/depreciate the same as the usd (in case of usdt). Second question: of course it is safer to withdraw to fiat. If you have your money in your own bank account, no one can take it away (except the government etc). But if you keep the fiat money on an exchange and crypto crashes, I would doubt that your "virtual" fiat money is safer than usdt (tether). If the exchange goes down, you might lose fiat and tether. And even if you withdrew tether to your wallet you would still have to trust the tether guys to play by the rules. But for a short term (few days or weeks) I would reckon tether is an acceptable risk.

ANZ New Zealand,[20] Bank of New Zealand,[21] Kiwibank,[22] Commonwealth Bank,[23] Westpac[24] and Police Bank[25] are also warning customers against using POLi. ANZ and Kiwibank have further advised that use of POLi invalidated the bank's online guarantee, potentially making the customer liable for any losses if their online banking account were to be compromised.

Did some research... Best argument I could find is:
Ban from internet. Law.
As Antonopoulos said, Bitcoin is nothing illegal, as it is simple data transmission. It is a protocol. It is not even money, because it is a ledger. 
And it only has value because people themselves give it value.
So, on which law premise would you ban Bitcoin from Internet? 
And recently a lawyer wrote an entire book stating that the Bitcoin case is very interesting because it’s difficult by actual laws to decide if Bitcoin can even be owned.
You never own Bitcoins, you only own keys to addresses. And even then, anybody can download the whole ledger, so it’s really property of nobody.

You got to be kidding right? You seriously want to discuss the scaling debate again? Both sides present their opinions as facts and the other side rejects them. So there is really no point for us to discuss it. And I am not interested to convince you of anything. All I said to the OP is to build his own opinion (there is this thing called Google, the first seqwit2x hit is actually a good starting point for further research) . If he comes to the same conclusion as you after he informed himself, then that's great but agreeing with you after reading your short comment is a bit simpleminded.
