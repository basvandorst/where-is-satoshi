Another element to the security: if the other party tries to steal from you, they lose their entire balance as penalty which is given to you (and should be more than enough to cover on-chain closing fees) ;)

Not directly, this guy used Lightning with Bitrefill to purchase a Steam voucher and then used the voucher on Steam.
But this demonstrates that Lightning will soon be ready and solve the complaints that Steam had when they pulled the plug on Bitcoin (unreliable confirmations &amp; heavy fees).
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:15:48
If a node advertises a negative fee, it's because a tx going through it in a specific direction would help it rebalance its channels. So any tx, spam or not would benefit that particular node.
As soon as channels are rebalanced, the node would start advertising positive fees again.

I don't think he gets it. Creating a functioning currency is not just copy-pasting bitcoin's code and changing the genesis block or even printing funky numbers on a random piece of paper. A currency, before anything else is a **network**, a network of value transmission, not just its physical manifestation be it with atoms or bits of data. And a network's value is exponential to the number of participants.
Bitcoin already has: 1/ sound properties that make it useful as money, and 2/ a growing network of participants.
If you just started from scratch with your own copy-paste coin, you'd have 1, but not 2. And why would people switch to your altcoin is they can have 1 AND 2 by just using bitcoin? You'd have to innovate, invent something able to disrupt bitcoin itself, and such a feat is not zero cost dear sir.

That's a double-spend indeed, but bitcoin transactions are supposed to be protected from double-spends only after being included in sufficient blocks.
Double-spending before a tx is confirmed (in a block) is really easy, but only one transaction will eventually get confirmed, usually the one paying the highest fees.

Here is how it's generated, for each and every address your wallet generates these 3 things in this order:
* a private key: this is a random string of data that allows you to sign (authorize) transactions to spend bitcoins.
* -&gt; a public key: this is extracted from the private key using the ECDSA algorithm. It allows people to check that your signatures are valid, but does not give them the ability to forge your signature.
* -&gt; an address: which is extracted from the public key using a hash function. Hash functions are one-way encryption functions. It allows to shorten the public key.
There is a 1:1:1 relationship between all 3 of these elements.
Now when you send bitcoins to an address, this is really a hash of a public key. In essence, you are putting your bitcoins in a safe where the conditions to open it are:
* provide a public key which when hashed equals to the address
* provide a valid signature of the transaction which matches the given public key
TL;DR: Your public key is what generates the address. It is revealed to the network only within a transaction, and it matching the address is one of the conditions required for the transaction to be valid.

1) You don't have to open a channel with everyone in town. Just a few channels might be sufficient. This is the "network" part of the "lightning network", if you want to pay someone, but don't have a direct channel with them, you can send the payment through one of your existing channels, which will forward the payment hopping through other people's channels until it reaches its destination. (ex: You have a channel with Alice, you want to pay Bob, but you do not have a channel with Bob. However Alice &amp; Bob are connected, so you send the payment to Alice, and ask her to forward it to Bob on your behalf). Best of all, this happens in a trustless and non-custodial manner, i.e. intermediate nodes cannot steal the in-transit payment (thanks to a cryptographic contract called the "Hashed Time-Lock Contract").
Also, you do not need to fill a channel with everything you expect to spend, because you can refill the channel through the network. Example: You open a $20 channel with Starbucks, you spend everything. Then let's say someone pays you through Lightning for some small service, their payment can arrive through your Starbucks channel which will now be refilled. Sweet, more coffee! (or something else, you don't necessarily have to use that channel only to pay Starbucks)
2) No need to close a channel to spend coins in it. If Starbucks wants to spend the coins they received from your channel, they can pay someone else using you as a router. (ex: they refill your channel, and in exchange you use some other channel of yours to route their payment to someone of their choice).
The only reason to close a channel is if the other party become unresponsive, which hopefully would be infrequent enough to not be a huge problem. 
Even in that case, in the future we will have "channel factories" which are a way to open/close payment channels off-chain, which will further optimize and reduce the costs of the whole process, dramatically reducing the need to pay miner fees.

You don't have to implement your own version. There is already 3 main implementations that are already in an advanced state of development (lnd, c-lightning and eclair).
If you want to build on top of lightning, just pick one and use their API.
For example, the LND api docs are here:

In addition to what others have said, I would suggest you to not sell in one transaction. Maybe split it in ~5 chunks, and for each one deposit/sell/withdraw one after the other.
This way if there's any issue, you won't have more than 1/5th of the amount you intended to sell being stuck.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:10:09
Miners also earn the transaction fees. So once all bitcoins are mined, their revenue will solely depend on fees.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:10:49
True, but the point was more about Lightning being used on mainnet to do a real commercial transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:37:36
As an ancient sage once said: "Don't gamble more bitcoins than you can afford to lose."
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:18:07
Just 7 billion transactions per year? They are little players, that's just about 221 tx/second.
With Lightning Bitcoin will have a capacity of millions of transactions per second, with fees much much lower than any payment middleman.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:04:28
I think if LN went full on mainnet it would actually decrease the congestion on the blockchain. Think about it, for example today it is 100 payments = 100 blockchain entries. Tomorrow with LN it will be like 100 payments = 2 blockchain entries. (assuming a channel used to do 100 tx) 
People will need orders of magnitude less space in the blockchain to do the same amount of payments.
That's not mentioning further improvements like MAST &amp; Schnorr (from which LN smart contracts would benefit greatly), and later on channel factories.

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:09:31
You're absolutely right ;)
When opening/closing a channel a fee is paid to a miner (regular on-chain transaction).
Then as a LN node operator you're paid routing fees for each and every LN transaction going through your node.
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:54:07
You're right in that the total fee is not proportional to the amount. But it is proportional to the transaction's data size (in bytes) (times the fee rate you choose ofc)
In this case, the transaction was quite big (in bytes): 51 inputs (the "From" part of the transaction) each of which being a multisig requiring 3 signatures. So this transactions contains  3 x 51 = 153 signatures! (instead of just 1 or 2 for a "typical" transaction). This adds up fast.

Slow expensive transactions are already becoming a thing of the past.
Give a try to the Lightning Network on testnet:
* Open your wallet here (they give you some test bitcoins to play with): 
* Go buy some sweet coffee at Starblocks: 
The payment is as fast as swiping a card! And the fees crazy low (11-22 satoshis, or even 0 if you have a direct channel)
Granted the two links above are working on the testnet, but the devs already tested some LN transactions on mainnet successfully. It's only a matter of time before we see easy to use mainnet LN wallets coming up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:53:44
Yes we are ;)
Devs are still testing, bugfixing &amp; polishing the user experience to make it easy to use, but we've never been so close!
Now we need to pressure companies to adopt LN, beginning with major payment providers like BitPay or Coinbase. If any one of those big companies implement LN, we'll automatically have tens of thousands of merchants accepting LN payments! A huge kickstart to adoption!

A time locked address essentially freezes the funds sent to it up to a certain date.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:22:15
It adds some degree of anonymity, because most of your transactions will not be on the public blockchain anymore (only the opening and closing transactions of a channel will be). 
With Lightning, you only have to communicate directly with the recipient of the funds + a few intermediaries if necessary (as opposed to everyone with the blockchain).
Even if your transaction goes through intermediate channels (**A** pays to **B**, **B** pays to **C** on behalf of **A**), it is routed with an onion protocol (like Tor), so intermediaries do not really know if **A** is the true originator of a transaction or a previous intermediary, nor do they really know if **C** is the real recipient or a subsequent intermediary.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:09:42
Exactly :)
If Alice wants to route a payment to Eve through 3 hops, looking like this:
Alice &gt; Bob &gt; Charlie &gt; David &gt; Eve
Charlie only knows that Bob wants to forward a payment to David.
David only knows that Charlie wants to forward a payment to Eve.
etc etc...
Nobody has the complete picture except for the originator of the payment, Alice, which is free to choose the path she wants her money to take through the network.
The longer and more random the path, the better the privacy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:51:52
Here's my ELI5: Bitcoin work like banknotes¹ with a face value attached to it.
Each "bitcoin banknote" has several data written on it:
* its face value (can be a round 1 bitcoin, or 0.08831 or any other random amount)
* the "name" of its rightful owner (the address)
* a cryptographic signature of the previous owner of that value to prove the transfer of ownership
Now each regular transaction happening on the network does those things:
* Identify one or more "bitcoin banknotes" as input
* Destroy them from existence ��
* Create new banknotes, with the rule that their sum cannot be greater than the destroyed banknotes (otherwise you'd be making bitcoins out of thin air)
Then we have what we call the "blockchain", which is a distributed database whose sole purpose is to record the order in which transactions happened. This prevents anyone from making 2 transactions using the same banknotes as input (they're supposed to be "destroyed" when they are used, so that you can't spend the same twice).
¹ : the technical term is "UTXO", for "unspent transaction output", but I like the banknote analogy.

They cannot force people to run code they don't agree with.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:59:30
Sort of, but still they wouldn't get the complete picture.
Payments on the LN are routed with an onion protocol (like Tor). So when a node receives a request to forward a payment, it doesn't know if the sender is the real sender (or another forwarder), nor does it know if the recipient is the real one (or yet another forwarder).
Even better, if you open a direct channel with someone you have to pay regularly, the payment is transmitted directly without routing through intermediate nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:13:59
I think anything that involves small/fast payments is a good fit, so games (LN basically solves the complaint Steam had with Bitcoin), restaurants, cafes, tips, groceries, movie theaters, netflix, phone&amp;internet bills, you name it...
But in the future, with a very liquid network, I think it could work for big regular payments too: wages, rents, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:41:10
Could be an option for them, it would probably reveal a bigger sample of the complete picture.
But they still wouldn't be able to catch direct channel payments. I'm pretty sure privacy-conscious people would prefer that.
Over the longer term, I think Confidential Transactions (like in Monero) will really help about the fungibility issue. I know some Core devs are working on that.

I didn't mean they were static values. Demand &amp; supply constantly fluctuate on the markets.
Yes, of course the current price reflects the current equilibrium of market forces at present time, but I wasn't talking about that when I said "unbalanced", I meant that demand is increasing more rapidly than supply can keep up (because of the extreme built-in scarcity of the resource), leading to a natural increase in prices.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:03:15
I've got a couple of thoughts on that question:
* for end-users, at some point we will probably start to see LN-compatible hardware wallets to secure the private key. Those nodes will not route automatically for others but will only engage in transactions when the user wants to manually pay someone.
* for hub operators that purposefully want to connect their nodes to as many channels as possible to collect fees, I think it must be taken as any other business with some risk/reward. They should not put all their funds in LN hot wallets, spread the risk to many different nodes, implement good security practices on their servers, regularly withdraw profits to cold wallets, etc...
* later on, maybe we will start to see "hardware hubs", like a hardware wallet but tuned to processing LN routing automatically to harden the security of hubs (do one thing, but do it very well!). Or maybe it will be "LN firewalls", sitting between the network and a LN hub, whose purpose would be to validate inbound/outbound LN tx to see if it makes sense (for example if some tx result in the hub losing its balance, block it, as it's probably an attack). I don't know any current effort to develop such protections, that's pure speculation from my part, but I think people will seek to build such things once the "LN base layer" is ready.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:54:59

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:24:49

There's no real way to predict how LN fees will evolve (except that the pressure will be downward), but the best time for profits will be at the beginning when the network is in its infancy. Later on margins will be razor-thin at best.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:50:18
I cannot put into words how awesome your work is, OP! Congratz!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:59:53
Setting up a Lightning hub is as easy as running a bitcoin full node: launch the server software on a machine and let it run. The only exception is that you have to commit some funds to it to be able to open channels (which can be managed automatically).
Once the hub is up and running, it will automatically advertise itself to the rest of the network and start routing payments for others.
This may be profitable. You can choose to charge a fee for the service of routing payments for others through your hub.
However it's expected that competition between hubs will drive down the fees. Charge too much and people will just use another hub than yours.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:31:57
Certainly! Batching multiple payments in a single transaction takes up less space than with separate transactions. Less space, less fees.

Yes, you can help testing LN by running a node. Here's some info here: 
Be sure to report any bugs you might encounter to the developers so that they can fix it.
In addition, you can help by spreading awareness of the LN to others and request LN support to bitcoin companies (merchants, payment processors, exchanges, etc...)
Any help is welcomed :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:09:31
Ok, I'm glad you learned about the divisibility limit ;)
But just imagine for a moment that bitcoins could be divided to infinity, even then the sum of all bitcoins values would still not be able to increase above 21M.
Let's take 1 bitcoin, and divide it many times:
divided in 2 : 0.5 + 0.5 **= 1**
divided in 4 : 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 +0.25 **= 1**
divided in 8 : 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 **= 1**
See, no matter how many times you divide it, the sum of their values is still 1. You could divide it into 1 trillion small parts, the sum would still be 1.
I think you're confusing the amount of coins in circulation and their face value with the total supply. Inflation happens when the total supply (the sum of all coins face values) increases.
If the sum of all coins face values remains the same, we do not have inflation.
No matter how many times you divide a bitcoin (or anything else physical or digital), as long as the **SUM** of their face value remains the same, you do not have inflation. Because you cannot make more of a quantity by just dividing it into multiple equal parts.
It's mathematics, but I hope my explanation made it more clear for you ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:41:03
Yes, it's open source, developed by many contributors coming from many backgrounds. Don't worry, it's fine to ask ;)
Even better, there is at least 3 competing (but compatible) implementations:
* lnd : 
* c-lightning : 
* eclair : 
Zap is open-source too, it's actually a UI frontend to make the underlying system easy to use.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:07:20
Lol no, how is that centralized? Pardon me, but I think you're mistaken in your understanding of how LN works. Intermediate LN nodes do not hold funds, these are hashed time-locked contracts, the swap of funds is signed and atomic.
Besides, anyone can spin up a new hub, there will be plenty of competition all over the world from many different entities. It won't be any more centralized than mining is, quite the opposite actually because capital costs to setup a LN node are much less than for mining.
And you're not even forced to go through hubs, actually if you do regular business with someone it's a good idea to open a direct channel with them, then fees are 0.

You are correct. Lightning is a network layer sitting on top of bitcoin. The goal is to "negotiate" transactions without hitting the blockchain every time.
For example, let's say you and I frequently exchange some transactions. Sometimes I send you some millibitcoins, sometimes you send me some millibitcoins. Now instead of recording each and every small transaction into scarce blockchain space, we just keep tabs of how much I owe you and how much you owe me, and every once in a while, we compute the total balance and settle the results on the blockchain.
This way our miner fees are amortized over a potentially huge number of transactions (making each individual transaction cost less the more we transact), but we also reduce demand for blockchain space (because we don't need to hit it every time), resulting in a natural decrease of fees.
I just described direct channels, but it's also possible to route payments to someone you don't have direct channels with if it exists some path from node to node that can transfer it on your behalf. This is achieved with a protocol similar to the Tor network, so it also provides anonymity and censorship resistance.
Lightning is still governed by the same principles as bitcoin, i.e cryptography and decentralization. This ensures that we can't cheat by manipulating the amounts of coins we owe each other. Funds cannot be seized, no third-party holds your balance (even if the payment is routed through intermediaries, smart contracts enforce the rules), and you can trigger settlement on the blockchain at any time.
There should be plenty of available nodes to power the Lightning Network, setting one yourself is not that much more complicated than running a full node. The more nodes there will be, the more different "paths" your money can take. With plenty of paths, the network should be pretty decentralized.

It's bitcoin's master plan, it lures people in by playing on greed, that's how it gets itself into the hands of the people in the first place.

It's not testnet. Testnet addresses don't start with "1", but either "2", "m" or "n".

I'm no expert but I understand that it may be the government's interpretation of the matter (in which case I and everyone shall comply).
But if that is the case then that's really shitty because it's a tax on evolving prices.
Ignore bitcoin for a moment. Let's say I got $1000 in my bank account and want to spend them on a shiny new computer.
I could do it now or I could do it later, say 6 months from now and the computer's price could then be $800.
Do I have to pay a tax on $200 of capital gains just because the vendor decided to drop the price? Is it fair?

What do you think bitcoin's intrinsic value is then?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:57:56
No he meant something else, the node operator himself might be at risk.
Because the node holds the private key that has control over the **node's operator own balance**, a hacker might be tempted to break into the computer running the node, steal the key and then steal the funds.
It's tempting to target nodes that are intended to be always-on to route payments automatically, because they need to have the private key in memory in order to work automatically.
The node's peers balances are safe (as long as their own nodes don't get hacked too of course).

You can see the map on the LN explorer here: 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:10
You're welcome. It's awesome if you have the capacity to contribute, any help is much needed!
Here is links to the major LN implementations if you want to get in touch with the developers:
* lnd (server): 
* eclair (server&amp;wallet UI): 
* c-lightning (server): 
* Zap (wallet UI): 
About fees, you do need to push a regular blockchain transaction to open one or more channels first, this will incur the regular miner fees.
Once you have channels opened, you can do pure LN transactions. The fees then fall in 2 categories:
* You have a direct channel with the recipient of the funds: no fees, 0 satoshis.
* You do not have a direct channel with the recipient, so you have to route the payment through multiple intermediate LN hubs: some small fees.
Each LN hub is free to choose their own fees for the service of routing the payment. But competition will help to maintain fees extremely low, because it's easy to setup a node and there is no limit to the supply of nodes (versus the 1 block/10 min cap of on-chain tx capacity).
Your LN wallet will choose the path resulting in the lowest fees. You do not set the fee you want to pay, but I expect LN wallets to show you the fee once they find the lowest cost route before you confirm a transaction.
For your last question, I don't really know, I'm not qualified enough about the internal workings of LN. But I recall that LN channels have a "minimum" balance and cannot go lower than that. I expect the software to set that minimum way higher than standard blockchain fees to be able to close a channel, or maybe it could route multiple LN tx to "rebalance" channels to healthy levels. Maybe a LN developer could answer better than me on that subject.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:07:48
By default it's testnet BTC, but you can configure the software to run on real mainnet BTC (at your own risk! the software is still young and in the process of being hardened).
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:10:35
Good question. Then people will just start routing around your hub and using another one. Also Lightning is designed so that their payments cannot get "stuck" if you switch your computer off in the middle of a transaction, either it completes 100% or not at all.
And if they had opened channels with your hub, but see that you remain offline for too long, they will be able to close their channels without needing you to be online. All it takes for them is to broadcast the last known state of the channel to the blockchain to settle it.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:18:01
I came here to see that comment.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:40:43
With on-chain transactions, every participant in the network has to know about each other's transactions (everyone knows everything). As the number of transactions grows exponentially, this makes it exponentially more expensive to run a full node, leading to centralization.
But is it necessary for everyone to keep track of everyone's small coffee purchases? That is not really efficient.
With off-chain scaling, only a few nodes need to be involved in a single transaction (the sender and recipient of the funds at the minimum, and optionally a few intermediaries if no direct channel exist).
It has been theorized that the Lightning Network will result in a "hub and spokes topology" so with some centers. But the good thing is that you do not have to trust those centers, they cannot cheat you, they cannot hold your funds, because a smart contract enforces the network rules. Either they play by the rules, or they do not, in which case it's easy to route around them.
Besides, setting up a node is easy, so that should give rise to a payment network offering a wide variety of possible paths for payment routing, making centralization essentially a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:04:23
Yes you're spot on, that fee will be given to the miner validating your transaction. The fees tend to go up when there's too many transactions on the network and to go down at quieter times.
But you can also complain to Coinbase customer service because they don't support SegWit.
SegWit is a bitcoin upgrade that allows for lower fees, and they're dragging their feet to implement it, resulting in abnormally high costs to their users.

See my post here for a good starting point:

It could reveal some partial info, but not everything. Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, so you don't really know which coworker is behind which address, nor all other addresses which are related to their wallet (so you can't really know how much they hold).
For further anonymity, maybe the company could mix the payroll payments with other non-payroll related payments (such as suppliers etc..) in the same tx. It's also possible to batch payments in multiple tx, for example if you batch up to let's say 50 payments in a single tx max.
Yet another improvement is to pay each employee to a different address each month. It's easy to do without communicating a new address each month to your employer with hierarchical deterministic wallets. You supply your employer with an xpub (extended public key), which is used to derive an infinite amount of addresses. And you keep and use your xpriv (extended private key) to control those addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:41:01
Even if it's digital numbers, if you take the number 1, and cut it into as much small fractions as you want, if you sum all those fractions you'd still have 1.
There will ever be 21M bitcoins in existence, cut these into as much small fractions as you want, if you sum all those fractions, the total will still be 21M.

The easiest way to get started is to run a binary of the "Lightning Desktop" app here: 
It comes bundled with a node and UI, you just have to launch the app to get everything running.
It's still alpha though, sometimes it works, sometimes it gets stuck. Your mileage may vary.
Personally I've had more success running the **lnd** daemon directly. But you have to be familiar with compiling software yourself and running in the command line: 
In all cases, once you have a node up and running, you've got to send funds to it (using a regular on-chain tx) to be able to open channels. Then you'll be able to pay, get paid and route payments for others through the lightning network.

The Lightning Network is a global decentralized payment system that allows you to send/receive bitcoin instantly with very low fees.
Each dot on this map is a "node", or a computer running the lightning protocol.
Each edge is a direct channel between two nodes. They are like tubes of money, in which bitcoins can flow freely from node to node across the whole network, at the speed of light.

Could you share the name of that bank so we can avoid it please?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:55:24
Yes and no. 
It's another blockchain whose token is named "RSK". But to get 1 RSK, you need to lock 1 BTC into a special address, then you can move your RSK on the rootstock blockchain as you wish and use it to pay for smart contracts (like ethereum).
However the process is reversible, send 1 RSK to a special address, it is destroyed and you get 1 BTC back on the main blockchain!
It's 2-way pegged to bitcoin. 1 RSK = 1 BTC, it's equivalent. So for all intents and purposes, the "RSK" does not exists, it's just BTC living on a different chain.

@_date: 2018-09-16 13:24:31
No, it's impossible and it's even totally unhackable.
Why? Because the total # of coins is a definition, and definitions can't be hacked (like you can't change the result of 1+1=2).
Bitcoin's definition is a set of rules that defines which sequences of blocks are valid. Among those rules being the coin emission curve which slows down until there is 20999999.9769 BTC.
Of course, nothing prevents anyone from forging another block which creates more coins and giving value to those coins. But it just won't be Bitcoin, it will be "something else". (i.e. this block will be refused by all Bitcoin nodes, and the creator of that invalid block won't be able to send it to someone expecting to receive bitcoins)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:41

I agree, mixers of the future would probably find it interesting to work over LN.
LN is like Tor for payments. It exactly works the same way. But instead of working with IP packets, it works with bitcoin transactions.
It knows the predecessor and successor nodes when routing a payment, but does not have knowledge if those nodes are the real endpoints involved in the payment or just other routers.
The details of that mechanism are described in the specification BOLT  
While LN obfuscates the originator and recipient of the funds, using actual Tor alongside LN would also provide privacy of the actual IP addresses of the nodes.

You're right, it's currently running on the separate test blockchain. It's to ensure it works well before putting real money on the line.

It's really amazing to see bitcoin being used where it's needed the most! Kudos to both of you :)
I'm assuming 1KaCUM6oCXv55QKAS4ZiciNWvqMQwhxSeE is the shop owner address? By looking at it on the blockchain I got concerned that it might be an exchange address, since its spending transactions are overpaying huge fees (50-100 sat/b) + spend a lot of inputs with some having a lot of BTC in them. It fits the pattern of exchange transactions.
So I was wondering if the shop owner knows the difference between custodial and non-custodial BTC wallets. Maybe that could be a good topic of discussion to have with him next time you go to his shop :)  
I feel like non-custodial wallets might be even more important in the case of Venezuela, since if there's tension between the local gov and the exchange's gov, he might get locked out of his account.

Right, the outputs represent payments (different recipients in other words).
But in my opinion, inputs are relevant too. If you do some consolidation, you'll have lots of inputs with few outputs, but the blockchain is still doing more "work" to process all the signatures for all inputs.

You're referring to the additional transactions that happened after the initial 1 BTC was deposited?
As far as I know these were sent by random people to the prize address for the lulz, so there's likely nothing in here ��
"DUP HASH160 PUSHDATA() EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG" outputs are actually encoding a legacy address (beginning with 1...), whereas "HASH160 PUSHDATA() EQUAL" outputs encode a script address (beginning with a 3...), which can be anything from multisig to segwit (and there's no way to know exactly what the script conditions are until a valid tx is seen spending that output).

Yes. Hard and sound bitcoin.


The coffee shop (or at least their payment provider, which is TravelByBit) have at least 1 or a few channels opened with some nodes on the network. The customer also needs at least 1 opened channel with a node on the network.
Although it's not necessary for this particular coffee shop to have a channel with this particular customer, as the payment finds its way from node to node on the network to reach the intended recipient (with no risk of intermediate nodes stealing the in-transit money thanks to clever cryptographic tricks).


Currently, channels can be opened with fees as low as 1 sat/vbyte (~$0.01) this needs to be done once (not every payment), and said on Twitter the payment over LN cost him 1.6 sat (~$0.00015), which is pretty standard right now.

Oops, sorry about that. Thanks for reporting your issue. Which channels are you connected to? Just ACINQ or do you have some others?
There is a path from ACINQ to our node through coinmageddon001 \(03f88ce6b35c7f268bf0c70d87c616ea2fdabeadb0c830d02b126db8bebadf79c3\) and 02a1d2856be336a58af08989aea0d8c41e072ccc392c46f8ce0e6e069f002035f3. 
On our side those channels still have enough capacity but maybe the intermediary channels between ACINQ and those nodes are depleted.
Anyhow, I can reproduce your issue, payments from Eclair through ACINQ are failing for me too. I'm going to upgrade my other LND routing node and open some capacity to ACINQ, hang tight.

There's nothing in the BIP39 spec that says words aren't repeatable.
"zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong" is a valid seed, and yields the segwit address 3CfyLSjYFFV6MUAMh3auTK9kfpPscPCHth for example.
Of course, currently no one really knows if some words are repeated in that puzzle.

You see two EQUAL's because the transaction has 2 outputs.
* one transferring 1 BTC to the prize address
* the other is likely the change sending back the remaining BTC to the original wallet on a new address (although that's the case 99% of the time but could also be the "consolation" prize OP was referring to xD)

Interesting thoughts, however I'm not sure Satoshi's heirs would resist the temptation to not use his private keys for so long haha.
I had a different theory that he may had purposefully used bogus addresses to avoid concentrating too much power in his own hands \(that is he either mined to random addresses without generating a private key first, or he destroyed his private keys after some time\).
As for his/her/their real identity, no clue and no clue if we'll ever know... But the question is likely to keep future historians busy for a while!

You're welcome ;) I get that some concepts are hard to grasp at first glance, but I'll try to clarify further using a simple analogy.
From a very high-level perspective: channels are like "bank accounts", and nodes are like "banks". When you get started, you open an account (channel) and this only needs to be done once. After that you can transact with anyone with the currency directly (no matter if they are on the same "bank" as you or not).
Please note that I used the "bank account analogy" because it gives a reference to something everybody knows, of course unlike banks, the nodes cannot steal or inflate your funds, that's the main benefit of cryptocurrencies after all :)
In a nutshell, Lightning is a trade-off compared to the "payments over 1st layer" we used until then:
* payments on 1st layer paradigm: account creation is efficient and fast (just creating a private key on your computer, no need for synchronization with the network) ; payments are inefficient (everyone needs to know about everyone else's payments)
* payments on 2nd layer paradigm: account creation is slightly less efficient and slow (everybody needs to sync everybody else's account openings) ; payments way more efficient because they need to involve only a handful of nodes instead of the whole network.
As payments occur much more frequently than "account openings", it makes sense to optimize them more.
Now as a user, how do you open a channel? See how it works on the Eclair mobile wallet: 
You have a couple of choices:
* open a channel with the wallet's default node provided by the developers (easiest for beginners)
* choose a node yourself (by pasting or scanning a node URL, something that looks like "0374ecf61ed6c1208c42339f47decde2bc0c4393ac95f07827b3471e939d7eb961
* choose a node at random (I find this a bit silly though xD)
Other developers are even working on an "autopilot" mode that takes care of opening channels in the background for you, so the experience for users will be even easier. 
Who are the nodes? They are computers connected to the Lightning Network that can send and receive payments.
People setting up those nodes can be regular users that want to pay, merchants that want to be paid, or even users that set up a node specifically to help route other's payments and collect fees in the process.

Transactions are irrelevant. Only inputs and outputs matter, here is the data for the same blocks:
* # of tx: 1407, # of inputs and outputs: 12177
* # of tx: 2383, # of inputs and outputs: 11354
* # of tx: 2207, # of inputs and outputs: 11400

Kinda risky. Since the spike is shown on the graph, that means it has been broadcasted prior to being included in the block, since it showed up on other people's nodes.
It would be smarter to just try to stealthily mine the tx without broadcasting it and risking another miner picking the fees before you.
Makes me think it was probably a bug or a human mistake.
@_date: 2019-03-09 23:21:15
By "counterfeit BTC" I mean any transaction that violates a consensus rule like: 
* transaction outputs &gt; transaction inputs
* descending from a block reward that do not meets the necessary difficulty or that created more bitcoins than allowed by the halving schedule
* invalid signature, or other script errors...
* otherwise valid but on a minority fork with much less accumulated proof-of-work
All these applied not only to your immediate transaction, but all its ancestor transactions it came from.
If you use a full node, these bogus transactions won't even show up on your balance, because you'll have validated the full history, so they'll just be rejected. 
But if you depend on a 3rd party server to tell you your balance (online block explorers, custodial wallets, SPV wallets, ...), you have to "trust" them to tell you the truth. If this trust is broken, the balance they tell you could indicate any number that do not represents what is really on the blockchain yeah.
@_date: 2019-03-01 17:44:47


I'm glad that you recognize we agree on that point.


I was talking about rate of progress, not really about alternatives. There exists current alternatives with different trade-offs, and there will be more future alternatives without a doubt. Competition is fine. If someday an alternative proves (and not just claims) that it's superior to Lightning and/or BTC in every relevant domain (scalability, decentralization, soundness, censorship-resistance and ease-of-use), then that will be fine too.


The real answer is that nobody knows. Maybe, maybe not, anyone giving any surefire time-frame (be it short or long) is a liar. That's the nature of software engineering on novel problems.

It doesn't generate a profit in and of itself.
Running a node is not about "helping the network", it's about helping ***you.***
It lets you know that the bitcoins you received are in fact yours and real (not counterfeit). Turning a profit requires to do something on top of it, like running a business.
That being said if it's a publicly-accessible node, it helps the network a little bit by providing a redundant copy of the blockchain and bandwidth to propagate data.

Pardon me, but where exactly did you see I had my "head in the sand"?
LN has a lot of work to do, that was basically the whole point of my post, just like the Internet had a lot of work to do in the 90's. Actually work on technologies crucial to the Internet started as far back as the 60's (packet switching), it definitely didn't happen overnight.
Technology never progresses as fast as we'd like to, because the desire for technological progress is basically infinite, while resources to make it happen are finite.
That being said, it's a perfectly reasonable thing to stay on the sidelines while it doesn't fit one's requirements (like the gentleman in that tweet).
I don't disagree with "it's currently clunky", it is. But I disagree with the statement "it can never improve".

Both BTC and XBT are used depending on the exchange.

Anyway, about the UI, I think it makes sense to separate the core functionality (fully-validating node) from the UI (just like the Linux kernel and graphical user interfaces are done in different repos for example).
Separation of concerns, and less social overhead. And since UIs are not consensus-critical, everyone is free to experiment and build things on top of the core validating node.
One could imagine different "distributions" of Bitcoin (like you see in the Linux world), all having a bitcoind kernel + different tools on top optimized for different use cases (advanced users, beginners, merchants, lightning operators, etc...)

ELI5: they do have a finite stock of bitcoin (and this applies to all exchanges). If you look at their order book, you'll see the maximum amount of bitcoins that are for sale at any given moment (sum of all the "red offers"). So let's say all of a sudden you buy all of it, then they'd run out of bitcoin and there will be none left to sell. Well, until the stock is replenished from other sources (miners, people willing to sell, etc...)
And the fact that it's very often replenished by all kinds of sources, means that it's not very likely to run out, even if it can. In addition, if lots of people are buying, the price skyrockets, which slows down the buying spree, even inciting some people to sell (thereby replenishing the stock) in order to profit.
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:06:17
Yes, a Bitcoin transaction has to be broadcast every now and then to include a Merkle root of all the recent proofs in the blockchain, so the service operator has to pay the mining fees.
Although so far they didn't charge to use the service, since their costs are constant and pretty cheap. That being said you can of course make a donation if you enjoyed the service :)
And about the variation of transaction fees over time, I recall Peter Todd saying that it's based on a daily budget. So if fees become twice as expensive, broadcast frequency would be halved. (for example publishing a proof once every 4 hours instead of once every 2 hours).

With Bitcoin, there is 3 possible kinds of "upgrades", each with a different difficulty of being realized. In all cases multiple people are involved, anyone can propose changes, anyone is free to accept or refuse changes.
* \[EASY\] non-consensus based upgrades: these do not require to change the underlying rules of the network, and rather just build other layers on top of the existing infrastructure. A few people can accept to use it and it'll work without needing approval from everyone. (example: Lightning Network)
* \[MODERATE/HARD\] consensus upgrades with backward compatibility: you need to have a majority of users to agree to the change. But reaching that majority can be progressive since it's backwards compatible and won't affect users that do not upgrade immediately. (example: Segwit)
* \[NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE\]: non backward compatible consensus upgrades: aside from a few bug fixes in the early days (when barely a handful of geeks used Bitcoin), these have never been successfully achieved on the grown up Bitcoin network as it is today. These require everyone to agree at the same time to the new rules. (example: none)
@_date: 2019-11-13 13:46:08
For any sort of automation, you could use a good bitcoin library in your favorite programming language. For example, as a C# dev I like NBitcoin:  [ 
If C not your thing, here's another pretty good one for Nodejs:  [ 
These will allow you to programmatically construct any transaction you'd like following your business rules. It's just a matter of combining inputs, outputs and signatures. With NBitcoin you can even connect to your own node to broadcast the final transaction.
Be careful about your security model tho. What if the wrong transactions are sent? (either due to a bug, or a customer finding an exploit). So you might want to separate the process in two parts (crafting unsigned transactions, and then signing the transaction after some sort of verification).
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:19:21
You're welcome, I'm happy if that can help you :)
1. Since there is no "global mempool" (each node has their own view of what's happening), some nodes may only have heard about the 1st conflicting transaction, some nodes only the 2nd, some others both. It's not really important since these are unconfirmed transactions and nodes just use the mempool as a temporary space while waiting for blocks to be mined. Money has technically not been "moved" while a transaction is not in a block.
2. Yes and no. They can include it in a block if they want, but that would just make that block invalid (i.e. it will be refused by everyone else, and the miner won't be able to use their reward for buying goods or exchanging with another currency. It's like everyone would recognize their mining reward as "counterfeit bitcoins"), they would just have lost the time and electricity spent working on that invalid block. In other words, yes they can create an invalid block containing a double-spend, and no they can't create a valid block containing a double-spend (by definition).
3. While that might seem like the case at first glance, it's not inefficient, since every additional hashing of a block has the same probability of solving the proof-of-work challenge. And it doesn't matter who does it. 100 miners doing 1 hash/second or 1 miner doing 100 hash/second makes no difference purely in terms of proof-of-work (except decentralization of course, but that's another subject).  
It's also impossible to have some miners working on block N+1, and some others working simultaneously on block N+2, since in order to create block N+2, you need to know the identifier of the block N+1, which is known only when it has been mined successfully.
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:24:50
Hi! You seem to have a couple of misunderstandings about how Bitcoin works, but I hope to clear that up for you.
* There is no need for Amazon to recognize the address from which a user is sending bitcoins. For each order, Amazon automatically generates a new receiving Bitcoin address. Since this address is unique to each order, when enough bitcoins are received on this address, their system will know which order is good for shipment.
* There is no need for manual checking of addresses balances. Amazon sets up an automated system, that downloads the blockchain block by block, verifies that each block is valid, and computes itself the balances of each of Amazon's addresses. When it detects that an address associated to a particular order has enough balance, it automatically sends a message to a worker in their warehouse: "ok, this order is good, pack items A, B and C and send to Mr. Something in New York".
For example there is already a lot of merchants that use a software called "BTCPayServer" that implements such a system. And since this is an opensource software, you can run it on your own computer without having to trust any third-parties.  
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:44:44
You're right!
And it's even worse than that. 3-5 days is just the delay for the money to initially become available to the merchant. But for the credit card transaction to become **irreversible** it takes 120 days. 
120 days for 1 conf basically, credit cards are reallyyyy slow.

On the miners side: while they are busy trying to create a new block, if they see a new conflicting transaction, they are free to choose which one they want to try to include in a block. Although, the most rational behavior for them is to include the one paying the highest fees. They will only ever try to include one of those transaction in a block at a time, because otherwise they'd waste their hashing power as there would be no chance to get that block accepted by the network.
On the full-node side (of everyone else in the network): when they receive a new block, they perform a number of checks, and if one block includes a double-spend, they will throw it away and forget about it, like it never existed. If all checks are good, they will accept all transactions in it, and store the block.
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:32:34
As long as Bitcoin itself continues to exist, your address will too.
You can check it anytime you want, albeit it'll just show up as "0 BTC" or even "No result found" (if there never was a transaction, explorers can't know about it yet, but you can still use it ofc).
As long as you (and only you) holds the corresponding private key it'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:26:16
He was probably referring to the on-chain footprint, not the human representation of the  address.
Addresses are not encoded as-is on the blockchain, but rather are turned into a series of opcodes which together form a script.
While sending to bc1- addresses do not make a lot of difference compared to 3- and 1- addresses (a few vbytes less), it's actually when you later spend from it that it makes a lot of difference [(15% savings compared to wrapped 3- addresses, and 38% savings compared to 1- addresses)]( And the savings are even greater for transactions with more inputs.
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:39:19
Indeed. The "block reward" (composed of the newly created btc + fees) is sent to the winning miner as a single step: the coinbase transaction (not to be confused with the company of the same name).
The coinbase transaction is the very first transaction in each block, and allows the winning miner to claim and send the reward (new btc + fees) to his own address.
If you mine for hours but do not find a winning block, you cannot broadcast it to the network (since it would be refused), if your work is not broadcast, it's as if it never existed, so no reward at all.

True, but this was a failure of a software implementation of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core, even if it wasn't called like that back then), not the definition of Bitcoin itself.
If people see that their nodes suddenly starts validating bitcoins that shouldn't exist, then people won't recognize these as real bitcoins (since everyone agreed that there shouldn't be more than 21M bitcoins) and will look to patch their implementation or change to another implementation.

You can make money by charging routing fees, to allow other people's payments to transit through your node.

Very nice! I love the clear and simple user interface.
One suggestion: add an estimation of the time it would take with the selected fees (both on the main "send" screen, and on the fee selection popup). For example an estimation with a 80% or 90% confidence to keep things simple and to not display too many estimations.

There is also the Bitfury Tardis, which is designed with upgradability in mind, including across chip generations. So when a next generation chip comes in, you can just swap hashboards without replacing the whole rig.

Hey, owner of [joltfun.com]( here.
Thanks for trying it out and being an early adopter of Lightning. The network is still in its infancy, so to be honest failures are to be expected at this stage, we're the pioneers paving the way! That being said developers, merchants and users are learning fast from experiencing it in production for the first time, so things are bound to improve over time ;\)
About the channel between Joltfun's node and Rompert's, I just checked and it is pretty unbalanced right now, there is only 1.49693 mBTC of inbound capacity left. While it may be sufficient to route a 1 mBTC payment, channels have to keep a minimum balance to pay for fees of the closing transaction and provide an incentive to act fairly \(to have something to lose as penalty if one peer tries to be nasty\). So maybe that's the reason why it failed.
Another big current issue is interoperability between c\-lightning and other implementations: it's randomly force\-closing channels, consequently hundreds of routes are disrupted. It's nothing that can't be fixed though, there is active works from the devs to solve this.
As others have mentioned, having a handful of channels opened to various nodes helps to provide redundancy in case a particular route is temporarily congested or failing. From a user experience perspective, I expect future LN wallets to offer a user to open something like 5/6 channels to various well connected nodes in 1 click as part of the on\-boarding experience, so that does not mean it would complicate things much.
On my side, as a merchant, I've been experimenting how to rebalance my channels effectively. I've tried [ which seems pretty interesting as it would allow me to get funds out of my channels without having to close channels, and as a result regain inbound capacity. So far I had no luck because their node is not well connected yet. So to help the network I opened a channel to them \(still waiting for it to open as I chose 1 sat/vbyte fees and it was just at the time when the current large influx of 1 sat/vbyte tx started haha\). And I encourage others to connect to them too.
What I'd like to do too is to be able to send "circular payments" to myself to rebalance channels. Example: Channel A is congested on my side, inbound capacity is low, while Channel B is congested to the other peer's side, outbound capacity is low. Solution: route satoshis to myself like this: Channel A \-\&gt; Network \-\&gt; Channel B. But as far as I know while it's theoretically possible for now we have to wait for an implementation to do that \(possibly automatically\).

Which risk of double-spend? Once a Lightning payment has been sent you cannot double-spend it.


The payment processing service can be just an open-source software. I know BTCPay is looking to get that implemented.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:53:19
Ok, here's how I do things on my shop:
* I accept Lightning payments (80% of customers pay through that)
* 1 second later a script sells what I owe in fiat on an exchange (with my buffer BTC). Immediately I know I'm paid AND hedged against volatility.
* Later on, I get funds out of Lightning to replenish my buffer on the exchange (step to be removed later when exchanges start supporting LN). I keep the surplus on a Ledger.
If customer pays on-chain the risk of not getting confirmation in time shifts on their side. There is a fixed time limit and I sell only after a confirmation (hence why such a large % pay with LN to avoid this inconvenience).


Don't worry I perfectly get that things are not always easy. Although there's no free lunch, accepting bitcoin right now requires a bit of effort but comes with new opportunities and being able to attract a new clientele (it's been working great for me in that regard, so worth the effort).
But that doesn't mean things are static, there's tremendous efforts being made to develop better tools so that bitcoin will be easier to use in the future. Pioneers can just get advantages early like with any technological innovation.
The end goal obviously is to have a rather stable currency that's used for receiving payments from customers and paying suppliers, so as to remove the exchange/hedging step. That will come with adoption and acceptance.

Hi! 
I do not have a deep technical knowledge of the intricacies of the protocol but it looks like your payment got stuck mid\-way on its route. If that's the case the satoshis should remain in your wallet (either a payment succeeds or fails entirely).
If you provide me with your order id I can look and tell you how it appears on my side.
Another question, how many channels do you have open, and with which nodes?
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:23:47
Hi! I just tried from the Joltfun.com LND node: receiving the tip of 1000 sats worked and sending it back worked as well ;)
Maybe your earlier payment failures were due to routing issues instead of interoperability.

Yes, it can, however it's extremely costly: $600k for a 1 hour attack, $14M for a 24h attack. (see: [
Now I think that if we had a serious prolonged attack going on for days, there would be community consensus to change the PoW algorithm asap. Changing the PoW is easy for users, just installing a new software, whereas for miners it means that billions worth of hardware is instantly bricked and their power and influence reset to zero. That's also what I believe is a strong disincentive to 51&amp; attacks ;)

@_date: 2018-06-07 17:02:52
The main benefit of the Lightning Network is precisely that you don't have to open a payment channel with everyone in town ;)
Let's say Alice opens a channel to Bob, and Bob has a channel opened with Carol. Now if Alice wants to send a payment to Carol, she can route her payment through Bob's channels (no need to open a channel with Carol first).  She sends the payment to Bob, then Bob forwards it to Carol.
The magic is also that Bob can't steal the payment mid\-way (using a cryptographic trick that we call Hashed Timelock Contracts).
In practice, with a Lightning wallet you would open a few channels to routing nodes that are well connected, and then it's enough to forward your payments everywhere else.

No need for confirms, keep a small BTC buffer on an exchange, sell immediately, transfer later with minimal fees.
And as soon as we'll have Lightning-enabled exchanges, buffers will be unnecessary, exchange what you need immediately.
Also if that's too complicated to do manually, code or hire someone to code that, then it's just a big opportunity for someone to set-up a payment processing business to perform those functions on behalf of multiple merchants.

First: do not reveal any crucial info to anyone.
If the QR code is of any use, depends on what the encoded text begins with. If it begins by "1...", or "3...", or "bc1..." then it's only the address, it can only allow you to see how many coins are in there, but won't enable you to spend them.
If it begins by "L...", or "K..." then it's likely a private key, then you can have access to it by using a wallet which supports import of raw private keys.
Another solution, is looking into your notes for a seed, a sequence of 12 to 24 random words, which can be imported into any wallet.

On the Woocommerce side no, nothing.
On BTCPay server side you have to get a c\-lightning node up and running, as well as the Lightning Charge server. Then it's a matter of giving BTCPay an environment variable \(BTCPAY\_BTCLIGHTNING\) indicating the lightning server RPC socket location.
Here's docker\-compose files with everything setup correctly \(I used these, slightly customized for my particular server configuration needs but the gist of it is there\):  [
There's also the "Deploy to Azure" option to setup everything in few clicks with less technical know\-how necessary.

Two options:
* [  : this will create a "proof of existence" in the blockchain. Free service. Your hash will be merged together with others in a Merkle tree though and only the root will be published in a transaction, so you'll need the attached "Merkle proof" they send you to prove your hash is included.
* Alternatively, if you want your full hash to appear in a transaction, you can type this in Electrum in the "Pay to" field: "OP\_RETURN YOURHASH", with an amount of 0.

Simple answer: No, it isn't unique.
If you found a valid PoW for a block, you could, hypothetically, just continue mining on that same block and after awhile you'd find another valid solution.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:19:01
Yes, because the "do you want this" messages only specify the hashes of each piece of data.
A typical transaction is around 250 bytes and sometimes even more (up to kilobytes for some) , but its hash is only a constant 32 bytes in all cases.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:39:25
Hey owner here, thanks and I'm glad you like the slogan haha :D
Which details do you want to know? The payment processing is based on BTCPay + c-lightning for the LN part (with a secondary LND node to workaround the few incompatibility issues that exists between different implementations for now).
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:06:54
Bluewallet by default uses their remote node (so it's custodial). When transacting, you'll use their already existing channels which are pooled among all their users. For transactions fees, you'll have to pay a small amount for each transaction you make.
Optionally you can install your own node and use this one instead (non-custodial) with Bluewallet. But AFAIK it requires a bit of technical know-how to set-up.


I suppose you meant channels? In custodial mode you won't have to manage channels, and making small transactions won't open channels, this is two different operations.
Alternatively, you may run an app like Eclair on your phone, which runs a Lightning node directly so that you can keep control of your own funds. In this case you'll have to open some channels first and it is indeed a good idea to do so when fees are low.
I opened a bunch of channels for peanuts since months that are still fully-functional to this day.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:20:43
You're welcome! And yes, with Eclair the node runs directly on your phone when you open the app (+ a background task which runs every now and then to watch for unexpected channel breaches).

There's no upper limit to how many blocks can be mined.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:58:07
You should look at the graph by size (not transaction count): [
Here you can see that each drop is pretty consistent by 1 MB (actually that's what we call "virtual-megabytes" because of the Segwit discount).
At lower fee rates the transactions tend to be larger (people defragmenting their wallets, since it's low priority they don't want to pay a lot for this). So even though at lower fees blocks are still clearing 1 vMB worth of transactions, since these tend to be larger it translates to a little bit less transactions by count.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:07:58
don't listen to him, buy satoshis instead!
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:48:00
As others have said, it depends on the fee rate (in satoshis/virtual-byte), which defines the priority of the transaction.
But there is also randomness, sometimes the next block will be mined 10 seconds after you sent it, sometimes it might take an hour.
This is due to the mining process which is probabilistic, so you can't predict with certainty when the next block will appear.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:01:37
You can either wait a bit, or as a receiver you can bump the fee (CPFP, Child Pays For Parent) to accelerate the process. 
I don't know which wallet you are using but for example with Electrum that's pretty easy to do (right click on unconfirmed tx &gt; CPFP &gt; enter new fee).
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:46:52
Y'a pas de quoi ;)
Pour le cold storage avec Electrum c'est pas que ça soit spécialement archi-dur, mais y'a définitivement plus d'étapes à suivre et quelques pièges à éviter. Faut bien respecter la marche à suivre quoi. La doc officielle est là: 
Personnellement j'ai commencé par ça, puis après j'ai acheté un Ledger Nano S pour le côté pratique.
Concernant les achats en bitcoin, en effet, acheter un café en bitcoin n'est pas très pratique actuellement. La raison étant que le réseau bitcoin est victime de son succès, les gens font trop de transactions du coup le réseau est surchargé lol, ce qui se traduit par soit des transactions lentes (si tu met des frais de transaction faibles) ou des transactions chères (si tu bump les frais, et là ça sert à rien de payer 2 € de frais pour un café à 1,50 €).
Donc en attendant oui, le seul usage du bitcoin est de le conserver et gagner plus de pouvoir d'achat qu'en 100 ans de Livret A xD
Mais les choses évoluent, prochainement (peut-être courant 2018) il y aura le lancement de ce qu'on appelle le "Lightning Network" qui permettra de faire des transactions de bitcoin instantanées et avec des frais faibles (genre 1 satoshi, soit 0.00006 €) ou même inexistants !
Ca résoudra le problème de surcharge du réseau et ça permettra de faire des paiements de n'importe quel montant facilement et rapidement. Bref ça va être cool ��
Si tu as d'autres questions n'hésites pas !
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:16:31
Passwords are kind of obsolete anyway. In my opinion cryptographic public/private keys and signatures is the way to go.
Give your online services a public key, log in by signing a message. And if possible secure your private key inside a hardware device (like a hardware wallet).
This way, no bruteforce attack (because 128 bits or 256 bits seed), no need to manually remember a different password for each service, signatures are valid only once for a single service (so intercepting it is much less damaging than intercepting a full password), hacking a credential database would only yield a bunch of public keys.
@_date: 2019-02-26 21:19:33
Good question.
The block reward is the sum of two components:
* newly created bitcoins (halved every 4 years, which will indeed come to 0 at some point)
* the transaction fees (which can be collected by the miner)
So as long as people keep transacting, there will be bitcoins to be earned by miners.
Will it be enough? We don't know, but fortunately there is the difficulty adjustment. If fees decrease a bit, then some miners would switch off their machines, then difficulty would go down accordingly, increasing mining profitability until the system reaches an equilibrium again.
If the difficulty adjustment can regulate fluctuations due to bitcoin's value (as we've seen these past months), then there's no reason to think that it can't regulate fluctuations in transaction fees when all bitcoins will have been issued ;)

Only time will tell us if it's going to work.
But a second chain with a two-way trustless peg is a good solution too.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:05:31
Technically, nothing would prevent anyone from grabbing the Lightning software and run it on the mainchain right now.
But it is my understanding that the software is still rough around the edges and that the developers are currently polishing it (making it more user-friendly) and testing it to ensure it works correctly before anyone puts any real bitcoins into it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:18:19
The reason: some bytes (the signatures) count only as "0.25 bytes" toward the block limit.
That's one of the benefits provided by Segwit :)

I'm not an expert on the subject, but I read that other nodes would have the ability to settle a payment channel on your behalf in case any peer is being a dick, and they would have an incentive to do so by receiving a small bounty if they do.
So this provides redundancy in case your node is unable to commit the legit settlement transaction.
Meanwhile B would lose all his funds for sure if he made the unwise decision to be a dick.

Very high-level overview:
Bitcoin is like digital gold, very good store of value but difficult and expensive to change hands (because block size is limited and cannot grow to infinity or otherwise no one would be able to process it).
Now instead of moving your gold 2.0, you just lock it safely in a vault and get a banknote (gold-backed dollar 2.0), which allows the bearer to withdraw the gold 2.0 from the vault.
Then if you want to pay someone, you can just give him the banknote, it's easier, cheap and instant. It's "as good as gold" because the banknote allows him to withdraw the gold 2.0 from the vault if he chooses so.
The person can in turn send the banknote to someone else, and so on and so forth.
The dollar used to work that way with real gold, but the difference with Lightning Network, is that you have cryptographic proof that your banknote is actually backed by real bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:08:14
We aren't getting rid of the blockchain, without a blockchain the Lightning Network cannot work ;)
It's just that off-chain scaling is: 
* Easier to deploy. With a blockchain upgrade you need to have overwhelming consensus before anything can change. Whereas Lightning deployment can be gradual without any breach of consensus.
* Instant confirmation (with on-chain transactions, no matter the block size, you need to wait to be in a block to prevent a double-spend) 
* And it's also a much better use of network resources in my opinion. Let's take as an example, if everyone buys their small coffee with chain transactions, then everyone needs to know about everyone else's coffee purchases, this gets exponentially more complicated as more people use the network for their day-to-day transactions. With Lightning, only 2 nodes + a few hops need to be involved to process a single transaction.
However, I do agree that despite all the advantages of off-chain scaling, we should in parallel seek optimizations to on-chain transactions, as long as optimizations are safe, well developed, tested and have consensus.

Hey, ça fait plaisir de voir un autre frenchy passer par là ;)
- pour acheter je te recommenderai Bitstamp, ils sont basés en Europe donc t'auras aucun problème à accéder au marché Bitcoin/Euro. Aussi ils acceptent la carte bleue si tu veux aller + vite (mais les frais sont + cher que par virement, à préférer ce dernier si possible)
- pour stocker ton bitcoin, il faut *impérativement* que tu possèdes tes clés, c'est la base (càd ne pas faire confiance à une entreprise tierce pour stocker tes bitcoins à ta place, sinon on a juste reinventé les banques lol).
Il existe plusieurs manières de le faire, mais le mieux est de les stocker en "cold storage" de telle sorte que si tu te fais pirater, personne ne puisse les voler.
Acheter une wallet matérielle comme le "Ledger Nano S" ou le "Trezor" est certainement ce qu'il y a de plus facile (surtout si le montant à protéger est supérieur au prix de la wallet). C'est ce que je te recommande, tu peux pas te tromper avec ça.
Sinon pour faire du cold storage gratuitement tu peux passer par une paper wallet ou alors avec Electrum en mode cold storage. Mais il faut faire **très attention** à faire ça "proprement" (générer les clés sur un ordi qui ne toucheras plus jamais Internet). Et c'est un chouilla plus compliqué à utiliser (si tu choisis cette méthode, sois sûr que tu comprend bien le procédé avant d'y mettre des sommes importantes).
En résumé, si tu veux éviter de te faire avoir:
- posséder toi-même les clés de tes bitcoins
- protéger les clés en cold storage

This is the evolution of the mempool (unconfirmed transactions) over time, in MB, and broken down between fee tiers (the colors).
Basically the transactions at the top are paying more in fees, and those at the bottom less.
It's useful to put the mempool into perspective: for example while at first glance you may think the mempool has 100MB of backlog, you now see that approx. half of that is composed of extreme low fee (0-5 sat/B) txs which most probably is spam, so the backlog of "legit" transactions is actually far less worse than what it appears to be.

Well every bitcoin in existence had to be created first somehow before being spent for the first time.
Go to a block explorer, lookup any block, find the first transaction (the miner reward) and you'll see about 12.5 BTC (+ 1-2 BTC of fees) going to some address. 
The miner just claims their reward and write themselves the transaction sending the coins to their address, so they are then "theirs" and part of their wallet, registered on the blockchain like any other transaction.
For example this transaction:  [ 
... is the reward of block 579131, awarding the miner 14.37798237 BTC to the address 1CK6KHY6MHgYvmRQ4PAafKYDrg1ejbH1cE.

        CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
        return nSubsidy;
    }
Translating to a spreadsheet formula, this gives (A1 being the block number, and the output being the block subsidy in satoshis):
`=IF(A1 / 210000 &gt;= 64, 0, BITRSHIFT(50 * 100000000, A1 / 210000))`
You're welcome.

It means that the amount of bitcoins you can buy with a $1 bill is slowly decreasing over time.
A year ago, $1 would have given you 0.001 bitcoin.
Now the same $1 will give you only 0.0001 bitcoin (notice the extra zero).
Similarly, it means that if you hold bitcoins, the same amount of bitcoins now allows you to get 10x more $ than a year ago.
So let's say if you purchased 0.001 btc a year ago with $1, now you could exchange them for $10.

You could do that, although you have to format it in such a way as to respect all the usual address requirements.
* It will have to begin by a usual Bitcoin address prefix, like "1..."
* Use only characters from the Base58 alphabet (so no "capital o", "capital i", or "lowercase L")
* Be of the usual length of a Bitcoin address 
* Include a checksum at the end to make the address valid (you won't have a lot of control over that part).
Some examples of 2 well-known addresses generated that way:  `1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE` and  `1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr` 
You can see that both: begin by the prefix "1", for the 2nd one they padded it with "X" to match the length and both end by a random-looking checksum.
Of course, addresses like that are generated "as-is", without starting from a private key, so while you can send coins to those (they're perfectly valid), the funds will forever be lost.
There is a different way to proceed, that we call "vanity addresses", which involve generating a lot of random keys, until you find one which by chance, corresponds to an address with the prefix you want. They'll be spendable, since you start from a private key, but generating them requires an exponentially increasing amount of time the longer the prefix you want to generate. So in practice you can't add a lot of text that way. It's also not recommended because it basically ruins your privacy.
In both cases you'll need a program to generate it for you, to fit all the requirements automatically.

BTCs withdrawn from exchanges are "real BTCs" if those two conditions are met:

There exists transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain, where some signatures can easily be "inverted" to find the corresponding private keys, and steal coins (if any)
It results from incorrect implementations of the ECDSA signature algorithm. A part of the signature is what we call the "r-value", which should never be re-used. If it is, anyone can find the private key.
Now if you're reading this, don't panic, that doesn't mean anyone can steal everyone's coins. It affects only bogus wallets, if you're using a good wallet implementing the algo correctly, your r-values are safu :)

Instead of addresses, the blockchain only contains "scripts", that is little programs that evaluate to "true" or "false", only transactions whose programs evaluate to "true" are considered valid spends.
Addresses are just a convenient way to shorten and communicate those programs where coins can be "locked".
So for example, the address "1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE", is really encoded on the blockchain as "Given a signature and a public key, hash the public key, if the hash equals to   759d6677091e973b9e9d99f19c68fbf43e3f05f9 and if the signature is valid given the public key and the transaction data, then the spend is approved"
These programs are encoded using binary instructions of course, but that's what they mean in plain english.

If you're able to program, you can use a good bitcoin library to bruteforce all your candidate seeds.
For C# you can use [NBitcoin]( or for JS there is [bitcoinjs-lib]( There might be others, but that's the only 2 I know and used.
Here's an example of how you could do it in C
First derive some addresses from a seed. Replace "m/49'/0'/0'" by your wallet's derivation path, and use any of the 3 methods to compute the address depending on your wallet type.
    var seed = new Mnemonic("blablabla your candidate seed here");
    if (seed.IsValidChecksum)
    {
        var masterKey = seed.DeriveExtKey();
        var walletKey = masterKey.Derive(new KeyPath("m/49'/0'/0'"));
        var receivingKey = walletKey.Derive(0);
        var addrKey = receivingKey.Derive(0);
    
        //P2PKH (Legacy)
        var addrLegacy = addrKey.ScriptPubKey.GetDestinationAddress(Network.Main).ToString();
    
        //P2SH-P2WPKH (nested Segwit)
        var addrNestedSegwit = addrKey.PrivateKey.PubKey.GetSegwitAddress(Network.Main).GetScriptAddress().ToString();
    
        //P2WPKH (native Segwit)
        var addrNativeSegwit = addrKey.PrivateKey.PubKey.GetSegwitAddress(Network.Main).ToString();
    }
Once you got some addresses with valid seeds, you could use the Blockstream API to check if there was some transactions in the past:  `

Yes, you get an address beginning by "3..." just like any other, that is public and can be used to send coins to it, or searched for in the blockchain.
You also get a "redeem script", which can be used for: spending your coins (once the timelock expires), and it can also be shared with others in order to prove that this is a timelocked address for a specific date or block number in the future.

It is actually impossible to tell the total number of transactions that occurred on the network as a whole, this is by design, for privacy :)
Some hubs may publish statistics about how many transactions were routed through them, but this will only give you a very tiny part of the whole picture and you'd have no way to know if their numbers were faked or not (underestimated or overestimated). 
There is also private channels which are not advertised and as such do not appear on the Lightning explorers at all.

You're right in that millisatoshis only exist on Lightning and disappear as soon as channels are closed. 
From my point of view, if I closed the channel I used right now, it would be like I paid 0 sat in fees for this particular payment (with very high probability, since it's probabilistic based on the fraction of a satoshi I "owe").
But millisatoshis are pretty much a "metering" unit that make sense when it's multiplied by a volume. It's like gas prices which are advertised with sub-cent prices, where the sub-cents digits only start to make sense when they're multiplied by the number of liters of gas you bought, since payments below a cent are not possible, just as if I paid 0.001 sat per tx multiplied by 1000 transactions, then I would know it would nudge the final closing balance by 1 sat.

Good question. Although I think it's unlikely those companies are browsing best way to signal there is demand for paying with Bitcoin would be to just ask them the question "Do you guys accept Bitcoin?" "Oh, not yet. No problem, maybe later then, I'll check again in the future."
All while sounding natural and polite. If it's a small/family business where you can easily chat with the owners, maybe have a casual talk about the subject if they seem receptive.

Vbytes (virtual-bytes) are pretty much just like bytes. The distinction comes from Segwit that offers a "discount" for witness data. 1 normal byte = 1 vbyte. 1 witness byte = 0.25 vbytes.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll add an option to convert the fee rate to other commonly used units.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:48:54
It's possible RBF was disabled in your wallet, so yeah it won't allow you to bump the fee in this case.
You can enable it this way: Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; "Fees" tab &gt; check "Use Replace-by-fee".
Now in this case you have another option which is CPFP (Child-pays-for-parent). It will enable you to increase your fee provided you have enough funds to cover the additional fee.
Right-click on your pending transaction &gt; Child Pays For Parent.

Technically, as soon as the transaction shows up on you wallet it is already usable, even at 0 confirmations. You can immediately make another transaction and send it elsewhere. Some wallets may not support this tho, and for some others you may have to enable this in the settings (it's typically called "spend unconfirmed inputs").
The number of confirmations only determines the "finality" of the transaction and the ease at which the sender may reverse it. 0 means it is extremely easy to reverse, 1 already very hard, and each additional confirmation further cementing the transaction in stone.
So that means, even if you can use the BTC immediately, you should consider it fully "yours" only when it starts getting a handful of confirmations.
To know how much confirmations you have, if it's not immediately displayed on the transaction listing, try to tap or hold on the transaction entry to display more info.

|1 hour|87-89|71-72|
|12 hours|61-62|15-16|
I can't seem to find more details on how their algorithm works to find out why. But 15 sat/b seems too low for a 12 hours confirmation window, since the speed of transactions at higher fee levels is pretty high at the moment.
The 70-80 sat/b range is also increasing fast at a rate of about 1.3 MB every 10 min, so this explains why my tool suggests a higher range to target a 1 hour window.

To verify that a certain amount of proof-of-work has been performed on a block, first you'd need to get its raw representation.
For example to get block 573644, you could fetch:  [
This will return its raw representation encoded in hexadecimal.
Now you can verify it for example in Python3 (assuming you saved it in "block.txt"):
    import hashlib
    
    # Read the block
    block_hex = open("block.txt", "r").read()
    
    # Convert the hexadecimal representation to raw bytes
    block_bin = bytes.fromhex(block_hex)
    
    # Keep only the block header (first 80 bytes)
    block_header = block_bin[:80]
    
    # Hash the block header using the SHA256 function twice, then reverse the byte's order
    block_hash = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(block_header).digest()).digest()[::-1]
    
    # Convert to hexadecimal and display
    print (block_hash.hex())
Running this script will output `00000000000000000002cb9d6677937ecde1d7e538b0890e67a7036ad83c575b`.
Now just by looking at this, you immediately notice that it begins by a lot of zeroes.Executing this script took only a few milliseconds for you, but you know for a fact that the person who created the block, whoever that is, expended a lot of energy to produce it.That is because finding an arbitrary input that makes the SHA256 function return that many leading zeroes is extremely hard and we know no better method than to try a lot of guesses until one randomly succeeds.
This is the most basic way. Now in reality there's a lot more to this because you need to know exactly how many leading zeroes are required at any given time. This is called the "Difficulty adjustment". For this you need to validate the previous blocks. You can find more info about it here:  [
Also keep in mind that there's a lot more to a valid block than just the proof-of-work check (signatures, block rewards, halvings, tx inputs/outputs, etc...)
That's the role of a full node to automate all those checks and validate the blocks for you ;)

@_date: 2019-04-23 16:11:12
Indeed, there is no way to predict exactly how fast the next blocks are going to be mined.
While this tool doesn't aim to 100% predict the future since it's impossible, it uses a probabilistic calculation instead. For example the "Standard" profile targets a 80% probability. So while a few blocks could be mined very fast in a row and eat the 1 sat/b range, it estimates it's unlikely given both the rarity of these events and the current high velocity of transactions.
Thanks a lot for the feedback! In any case I'll definitely observe how it reacts in different situations and try to fine-tune it if necessary :)

I don't think this would be possible. Segwit added a new feature (the witness data portion), which was optional and without rewriting existing rules.
While OP\_RETURN is already part of the protocol, I think modifying it could be risky and lead to a split in terms of consensus.
Besides, OP\_RETURN is actually good because it creates a provably unspendable output, which gets trimmed from the UTXO set.

Good luck, it's nice that you got the willingness to learn :)
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:30:45
Thank you for the feedback!
Today is indeed a busy day for the network. To compute its estimates it looks at the size of transactions more than the number of tx, in addition with the velocity of new transactions which is indeed an important component of its calculations.
For example, it detects that the 70-80 sat/b range is currently increasing at a consistent rate of about 1.6 MB every 10 minute, so that's why it suggests higher rates currently since on average it's likely to keep getting saturated.
When the velocity slows down it will detect it and readjust, anticipating blocks to drain lower ranges of the mempool.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:52:37
Even during high fee periods, I think there is still at least 1 or more anchors per day included in the Bitcoin blockchain. An accuracy of 1 day might be more than enough for most use cases. So for a free service this is pretty damn cool.
For example you can see the latest transaction ids of one of their calendar servers here: [
Even if fees rose significantly today, I can see there is already 2 transactions dated for April 2nd at the time of writing.


If I understood you correctly, you are talking about timestamping many documents and then asking if you can later check each one individually or if it's only for the aggregate group of documents?
Of course, you can timestamp each document individually, and for each one you'll get a "proof" file (\*.ots, which contains the Merkle branch it will be included in). You can later use each proof file to check the timestamps of each document individually.

Quite the same story here. I first heard about Bitcoin and initially thought "it's either a scam" or "while the idea is interesting it won't work out". Then kinda forgot about it, and some years later it came back on my radar and it really made me ask myself "why is it still a thing after all these years? there must be something".
This last step "oh, it still exists" is IMHO the most powerful factor for people to really start taking Bitcoin seriously.
Right now most "normies" had their first exposition to Bitcoin in late 2017, and so they're now in the "forget" phase, wait &amp; see what will happen when they'll realize it's still alive and kicking within a few years.

To parse Blockstream API's answer you could do something like this (using Newtonsoft.Json to handle JSON). This will return \`true\` if the given address had some transactions.
    static HttpClient _client = new HttpClient();
    
    static async Task&lt;bool&gt; CheckAddress(string address)
    {
        var url = $"
    
        var json = await _client.GetStringAsync(url);
        var jobj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;JObject&gt;(json);
    
        return jobj["chain_stats"]["tx_count"].Value&lt;int&gt;() &gt; 0;

How much fees did you pay exactly (in sat/byte)?
Currently estimates are at 67 sat/b to get into next block, or 25 sat/b to confirm within 24 hours.

Thank you so much for the feedback!
A ballpark idea of the USD equivalent is a good idea. From my notes the "typical" tx size is about 226 vB (legacy), 168 vB (Segwit compatibility), 141 vB (native Segwit).

I get your point, but personally I'm not really interested in getting my money "out of the channel" (I get by that you mean closing the channel). I like being able to transact with low fees.
As for opening a channel, even now it would cost max $1 to get it done fast, or maybe $0.50 if you're not in a hurry, and since it can do an unlimited number of transactions this is still a pretty good deal IMO.

A\* is pretty much just like Dijkstra but uses an heuristic to explore the graph in the order that is the "most likely" to be the best route, to explore less nodes in the end.
In a video game, since it has a spatial context, the heuristic can be the Euclidean distance between A and B.
But since LN nodes do not have a "geographic position" in the graph, I wonder which heuristic could be used instead?
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:20:55
Thanks a lot for the feedback! I'll definitely try to tweak it if necessary.
Keep also in mind that it takes into account the current velocity of transactions. Currently the mempool at this fee range seems to increase fast, so that might explains why it gives slightly higher estimates.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:45:18
That's an interesting comparison.
To be honest for this project I initially thought about just making a nice UI for Bitcoin Core estimates. But IMHO the longer timeframes are not sensitive enough to mempool velocity. Given the shape of the mempool graph today I'd be surprised if a 1.1 sat/b tx could consistently confirm within 12 hours.
So that's why I tried to design an algorithm to improve upon that. With fast estimates it seems to give results that are pretty much in the same ballpark, but it diverges more on the longer ones.

I suppose it worked something like that:
* hacker opens a channel to some routing node, the state  is now something like [hacker 5 mBTC - 0 mBTC other]
* hacker sends a payment to someone over LN (possibly himself through another wallet), depleting his side of the channel, so state  is [hacker 1 mBTC - 4 mBTC other]
* hacker tries to publish the old state  which has more balance on his side, to try and reverse the transaction.
* the other node detects the fraudulent transaction, and broadcasts a counter-claim smart-contract, proving that the tx was fraud, and getting the entirety of the channel's balances as penalty (its own balance + whatever was left on the other side).
If the attack had succeeded, the attacker would have doubled his money (by keeping the payment he sent to himself at first, AND reversing the transaction with the initial routing node), effectively stealing from that node.

Yes, it is similar to the stuff Monero uses.
In a nutshell this is an algorithm that encrypts the transaction amounts on the blockchain, so that nobody except the transacting parties can know the exact amounts, while still allowing everyone to verify and prove that no coins were created out of thin air (sum of inputs == sum of outputs).

I agree with you that the reason why bitcoin is interesting is not obvious today to the majority of people... but it was the same when the internet, or the computer or the phone first came out. 
It's radically different from what people are used to, so it may take some time to discover the benefits and adjust. And those that have enough foresight/done enough research to find out early before everyone else may be rewarded for their risk-taking (or punished if they are wrong).
About the benefits, like you mentioned there is the whole "cypherpunk/decentralized" argument that while appealing to those that care about decentralization, may fall on deaf ears for the mainstream public that just care about "send X money from A to B".
I asked myself the same question, but I found out some properties of bitcoin that may appeal to this latter mainstream group:
* in a BTC-world, there is no foreign exchange needed. Travel from Europe to America to Asia, and pay using the same currency. No mental-gymnastics to convert prices, no exchange fees, in short much less friction.
* speed of opening a new "account". A bitcoin wallet can be created in less than 1 second vs a bank account that takes weeks or months if you fit a profile that they don't particularly like (like student, no to few money, or from 3rd-world countries ...). The Coinbase case is not specific to Bitcoin, the long account opening process is specific to Coinbase, not Bitcoin itself. In a BTC-world, say you're just beginning in life, get your 1st contract, need to open a new wallet, 1 second later it's done, and you receive your salary in Bitcoin. For example: a few months ago, a friend of mine was struggling to open a bank account (student, no work experience, so not a customer banks tend to like), and the banks always replied to him with excuses about how something was missing from his paperwork and whatnot. He wasn't particularly convinced about bitcoin, but that was until a night, when he was on his computer struggling to triple-check everything was correct with his paperwork to open an account for the n-th time, and during the whole time I just ran a script on my computer creating/"opening" a dozen bitcoin addresses per second, and it blew his mind. In this case, bitcoin would've been a solution to his problem.
* in a fiat-world, prices of basic items (like food, water, electricity, ...) tend to rise over time. People DO notice that and complain. If we denominated the prices of basics in BTC, prices would tend to slowly decrease at best or stay rather stable at worst (even assuming late-stage adoption with much less volatility and less upward movement than during the last years).
All these are things that the average-joe can understand without having a Ph.D in economics, like you don't need to be a mechanic to value automobiles.
But as I said, because we're still early-stage, these benefits aren't easily apparent just yet. Early-adopters discover them first by doing research and taking risks, they help bootstrap the innovation &amp; the ecosystem. And as it develops, the value slowly becomes obvious, and that's when we enter mainstream adoption.
PS: Of course, I don't have a crystal-ball, maybe it'll never happen, but I think there's good valid reasons to think bitcoin has at least a chance at it :)

That is computed by applying a cryptographic hash function on the block header data.
Blocks always contain the hash of the previous block (hence the name "blockchain").

Your btc isn't lost, don't worry. The only way for it to be lost is if the sender purposefully signs a double-spend before it gets confirmed.
Transactions are processed by the network on a best-paying-first-served basis. Each transaction pays a specific fee to miners, and miners just pick the best paying ones first. That tx pays a fee of 7 sat/b, which is a bit low since the network had a spike of activity during the past days where fees as high as 50 sat/b or so were necessary for immediate processing.
You have 3 options:
* Wait, until the network activity cools down and fees go down to the 7 sat/b range. This might take a few hours, a few days, or more, no one can predict it with full certainty.
* Ask the sender to RBF (Replace-By-Fee) the tx. This updates the transaction so that it pays more fees, leading to quicker confirmation. Only the sender can do that.
* Do a CPFP (Child-Pays-For-Parent). Simply put, this allows you to bump the fees yourself without the need for the sender's cooperation. However, you need a wallet that supports this feature, and to already have some coins in it to use to bump fees.
Here's a guide how to do that with Electrum: [
Also here's a cool website that shows estimates for confirmation times at different fee rates: [

I'm thinking perhaps you mistyped the amount (careful about the monetary unit)? Just do another transaction in that case.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:48:21
That's not robbing though. More like enforcement of a pre-signed contract.
When a channel update takes place, both parties are signing a new updated state (which is a regular bitcoin tx, just not broadcasted yet) which says: "I agree Mr. A, to receive X btc, and you agree Mr. B, to receive Y btc, this is contract  AND they also sign a revokation contract: "We agree, Mr. A and Mr. B, if either one of us broadcasts an old contract &lt; 42, the other party gets everything.". And both must be signed for a successful channel update to take place. (I simplified but this is the gist of it)
So the eventual robber agreed and gave consent to lose everything in contract in case he tried to be nasty, with his signature as proof.

I'm wondering what value does a blockchain offers to such applications within the realm of a private company like Walmart...
A blockchain is a distributed time-stamping system, used to find a strict consensus on the order of events in the presence of adversaries (allowing to solve double-spending for example).
For just storing the data of a private company it just seems like a less efficient database to me.

I recall reading a discussion about this on Twitter of a mechanism of asking about the channel state to the other peers but with some cryptographic tricks used in a way to minimize their chance of lying.
Also I think mature LN wallets will probably connect to some kind of backup service and deeply ensure that everything is correctly saved before updating channels.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:18:18
You don't have to reveal your private key with LN either! Just the signatures of updated channel states. Other peers have no business knowing your private keys no matter on or off chain (that's why it's "private").
It's true you have to be online, but that doesn't prevent you from requiring manual input from a device if you choose to use that solution.
The workflow to pay using a hardware wallet over LN would be remarkably similar to regular payments:
* You receive an invoice from someone
* You plug your wallet  
* You instruct your node to pay the invoice, it constructs updated unsigned channel states, and sends the unsigned tx to your wallet
* You check that everything is correct on the wallet's screen and push the button
* Your wallet sends back the signature to your node
* Your node can then broadcast the new signed state to your peers to complete the payment.
This could be a good solution for securing the "end-user making payments" use case. 
Of course that does not apply to routers that want to be online 24/7 and sustain a high-throughput of payment forwarding to collect fees. Although I think in that use case we could develop a dedicated hardware "LN verifier", which would be like a normal hardware wallet, except it would have the additional feature of automatically verifying if transactions make sense (do not empty the hub's wallet) and trigger the signature automatically if everything's good. It's still a machine making decisions but externalizing the signature and verification to an external simple device that does just that would still benefit from limiting the attack surface area.

Of course you can send just 1 satoshi over Lightning :)
This warning is just a wallet-specific thing that alerts you when the fees are higher than some % compared to the sent amount. And since fees on LN are typically around 1 sat these days, so a fee of 1 sat to send 1 sat is 100%, this explains why the wallet freaks out.
Obviously, since 1 sat is still so small, you probably don't really mind, so all you have to do is lower the % or disable the alerting feature of your wallet, which you will probably find in the Settings of your app.

Good reasoning!
If we want a more realistic estimate of bitcoin's ultimate valuation if it achieves 100% success, I think we need to look at the market cap of all fiat currencies in the world.
"Money" is an asset of its own, if bitcoin becomes dominant, it would mean the value that people give to fiat money would just "switch" more or less to cryptos (since bitcoin is competing directly with other currencies, not with real estate).
[In 2017, the world's total money supply is estimated at 90.4 trillions of **$-2017**]( (I use the term "$-2017" to represent the approximate value of a dollar in 2017, to have a somewhat stable valuation metric, because price ≠ value).
90.4 trillion / 21,000,000 = 4,304,761
So bitcoin's upper value could be approximately in the vicinity of 4 million dollars of 2017. Now if you ask me what would be the price in dollars of the year when we reach that value, I would say it's going to be trending towards **infinite future-dollars** (but not infinite value, price ≠ value remember), as in our hypothetical scenario everyone uses bitcoin, rendering legacy currencies useless and worthless.

Correct. Although not necessarily *all the time*, but just "frequently enough". It depends on the length of the time-lock (which can be configured as you wish).
For example, if the time-lock is 1440 blocks, you have about 10 days to detect the double-spend and prevent it.

For me a currency is always... a currency, an intermediate thing used to trade goods.
Furthermore, I would argue that bitcoin is much more closer to "traditional currencies" (which I view as being gold, silver or even seashells), because of its similar basic properties (scarce and decentralized). 
But again that's my own interpretation :)

You can't force a hard-fork with 51% of mining power.
There is a set of conditions that a block needs to pass to be considered "valid" by the network, the proof-of-work is one of them, but not the only one.
For example, if you own 51% mining power and mine blocks that create more than 21M bitcoins, your blocks would succeed at the "proof-of-work" test, but would fail the "subsidy cap" test, and so they would just be rejected by the nodes.
If you go to an exchange, and try to cash out your excess bitcoins, the exchange would not credit you, because your faulty block won't even show up on their node.
In the end, you would just have wasted a huge amount of electricity at a loss.

While this is true that a blockchain cannot sustain huge tx rates (without offchain solutions), however the POW is totally unrelated to that.
The POW is computed only on block headers, which among other things contain a fixed-size hash of events recorded in a block (the merkle root).
That merkle root could cover 1, 10, 100, or a million events it won't make the POW calculation longer just by itself.

Bitcoins look like a database. In a nutshell, this is just a gigantic file that contains all transactions ever, it looks like this:
* Address A received 12.5 new BTC because it mined this valid block: [proof of work]
* Address A transferred 0.0175 BTC to Address B: [A's signature]
* Address B transferred 0.00279 BTC to Address C: [B's signature]
* etc...
This file (that we call the "blockchain") is replicated and synchronized on thousands of computers all over the world. You can also maintain your own copy of it by running a full software client (like Bitcoin Core).
Individual bitcoins do not have a specific identity, they are just numbers assigned to an address (scriptural money).

Here is some additional ideas:
* easiest way for now is a semi-trusted solution like [Strike]( that takes payments on their node for you (which will likely be well connected), and as soon as your turnover reaches some threshold, they send it on-chain to you. (yes, it involves trust, but only for a limited amount of sales/time, you decide if it's worth the tradeoff)
* open a channel to some hubs, then do a large payment to deplete the balance on your side (for example to pay your suppliers before making any sales). This will provide inbound capacity.
* accept channel openings as payments: if a customer wants to pay you, but no route with enough funding exists between you and them, they may open a channel with you, push the amount of their purchase on your side of the channel (so you get paid), maybe commit of bit more capacity on their side for future use, all in one operation, and then call it a day. Now since it's a channel opening it's not instant and there's a need for blockchain confirmations to make it irreversible, but for small amounts it may be ok to accept it with 0-conf, as long as it's just a fallback situation and that it does not happen most of the time.
Also in the latter case, in the future a thing like channel factories (3rd layer) may provide further optimizations and make it faster to open new channels. That should provide robust "self-healing" capabilities to the Lightning Network.

Interesting read and nice work! I was competing with you the whole time but you were faster, enjoy your well deserved reward :p
I saw the wallet being swept just when I found out from my script that the distribution of data made so that it was probably ASCII.
Before that I explored the idea of an encoded BIP39 recovery seed, since the artwork appeared to be divided in 12 patterns separated with columns of blue bricks. So I wrote a script to try different decoding schemes to go from the 12 subpatterns to 12 words, and then derive up to 400 addresses (both receiving and change addresses, and trying both standard BIP44 derivation paths and Electrum-style paths) using that seed to see if any matched the artwork's public address. That was a dead-end obviously.

Coinbase is a custodial wallet, so like a bank they are a 3rd-party and received funds on your behalf and hold it for you (and you have to trust them not to steal from you).

Let's say you have a script address (P2SH) with multiple conditions on how funds can be spent like: if CONDITION1 or CONDITION2 or CONDITION3, where just one of them is necessary to spend the funds.
Before MAST, when you submit a transaction to the bitcoin network, you need to include the whole "redeem script" detailing all the conditions. The more branches/conditions there is in the script the more space it takes, so the more expensive the fee is.
With MAST, let's say if you spend funds only according to the rules of "CONDITION2", you only need to include the part of the script detailing that condition + a "proof" that the instructions of "CONDITION2" are included in the script hash (i.e. the address). As a result the transaction will take much less space than including the whole script.
An example of usage that would benefit from that is Lightning Network transactions, where the contracts have multiple conditions (oversimplified: spend IF specific hash provided OR if a specific time has elapsed...).

Older versions of Bitcoin had a system that allowed early "admins" (like Satoshi and early developers) to publish alerts to inform users about problems with the network.
This system was secured by a private key, only holders of that key could broadcast alerts.
Later it was concluded that this system was bad (as there should be no "admin" of the bitcoin network whose voice matter more than others), so the system was dropped from newer versions of Bitcoin.
The key is revealed because it's now useless.

I would go even farther and merge the two options in one.
Quoting the BOLT-11 spec, lightning invoices can be embedded in standard BIP-21 URIs:


This way the user only sees one QR code/link, older wallets immediately recognize the on-chain address, and LN-wallets get the LN invoice.

It works through private/public key cryptography. The maths are a bit complex, but here's a simplified explanation:
When you create a private key (a huge random number), you apply an algorithm that derives a "public key", that is mathematically linked to your private key.
When people send funds to you, the funds are associated to your public key. As the name implies it is perfectly safe to reveal your public key to the whole world.
Now when you want to spend, you need to prove to the world you own the corresponding private key.So you use that algorithm, that given: your private key + the transaction = a signature.
Only the private key is able to produce a signature.The public key allows only to verify if the signature is valid. That's how the world know it was you, but still cannot impersonate you. Creating new signatures, or computing the corresponding private key from a public key is mathematically infeasible.
So now you might say "what if someone copies my signature and changes the amount or recipient?". Impossible again, as signatures are linked to the transaction data. Changing the amount or recipient would require a different signature, that only you, the holder of the private key, can produce.

The dollar can be used today and is useful to its present day users, I'm not denying that. My point is just that the economy and military has no impact on maintaining the dollar's value over time, as is evidenced by the previous graph.
About "inflation good for economy", people still want to defer purchases and store value sometimes, that's a perfectly acceptable use case of money.
It doesn't matter if the FED wants to force inflation on others, people that want to save will always find something that enables this use case, be it precious metals or cryptocurrencies. Economics are even more complicated.

I'd be more interested by a hardware wallet that communicates using QR codes (so with a camera for input, and a screen big enough to display QR's for output).
The rationale being that this way you can "see" the information being transferred back and forth, and QR's are very low bandwidth so it's more difficult to sneak a hardware wallet compromising virus in it.
With USB and Bluetooth, I don't really know what's going on inside the communication channel.

Sorry but I think you don't really know how the Federal Reserve System works.
The Treasury is only responsible for the physical issuance of notes and coins, not the decisions about monetary supply, only the FED can give an order for physical printing.
The FED can still decide to increase the supply of dollars in circulation through arbitrary decisions, and that's easy for them as it just requires changing digits in a computer (the vast majority of the currency supply is not physical).

Ok, first advice is to keep the majority of your coins off-exchange, in a safe cold wallet.
And once you feel like the price is getting near your target, transfer to the exchange and just post a **Limit Order** at your desired price.
It will automatically be executed when (and if) the price reaches your target, so you don't have to worry about being unable to reach the exchange's servers at that precise moment.

That's still the same problem, I can't check with my own eyes that the bandwidth is really limited.
Although I think my idea is better for a different use-case (savings with a significant amount). I wouldn't mind paying more to embed a camera for such a use-case.
I'm perfectly fine with USB/Bluetooth hardware wallets for day to day small amounts, as it remains convenient and still orders of magnitude more secure than keeping keys on a regular phone/computer ;)
Maybe in this case using Bluetooth Low Energy would be sufficient as it limits the bandwidth, range and processing power required.

You're right. The actual maximum amount of bitcoins that will ever be mined is: 20999999.9769 BTC
Mathematical explanation:
Reward cycles last 210,000 blocks, the first one paying 50 BTC, or 5,000,000,000 satoshis (which is the only unit that matters to the protocol). Reward halved and truncated to an integer every cycle.
So if you sum every cycle's total rewards:
210000 * 5000000000 +
210000 * 2500000000 +
210000 * 1250000000 +
210000 * 625000000 +
210000 * 312500000 +
210000 * 156250000 +
210000 * 78125000 +
210000 * 39062500 +
210000 * 19531250 +
210000 * 9765625 +
210000 * 4882812 +
210000 * 2441406 +
210000 * 1220703 +
210000 * 610351 +
210000 * 305175 +
210000 * 152587 +
210000 * 76293 +
210000 * 38146 +
210000 * 19073 +
210000 * 9536 +

Of course! Be my guest ;)
The very last block with the power to create the last newly-emitted satoshi is block 6,929,999.
At time of writing, the last block mined is 520,030, dated 2018-04-26 16:51:30 UTC, so there is 6,409,969 remaining blocks to be created.
Since block production is 10 minutes on average(*), 10 minutes * 6,409,969 = 64099690 minutes remaining.
Convert that to years: 64099690 / 60 / 24 / 365.25 = 121.86 years remaining.
This would put the estimated date somewhere in year 2140.
(*) : sometimes blocks come faster, when new hashing power comes online faster than the difficulty can retarget. But nobody knows if that will hold true for the next hundred years.

A blockchain is just a ledger of accounting records in chronological order (who owns what, who transfers how many to whom).
A block is just a "page" of that ledger that can hold a finite amount of those records.
It's "chained" because every new page is attached to the previous one so that you can know the order of events, from the first page to the last page.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:33:21
Confirmation delay depends on the fees you paid in satoshis/byte (sat/B), higher fees = faster. The fees required for different "confirmations speeds" vary depending on the activity on the network.
Just because you were able to get confirmed in 30 mins yesterday does not mean it will certainly be the case tomorrow at the same fee rate ;)
Here's some options to estimate the current fees:

Tell him that Bitcoin is not a company but a "protocol" (or a "language" to use a layman term) that allows to communicate the notion of value.
Is "english" at risk because the owner of "english" could steal everyone's "english" or pull the plug on the whole "english" system? No, because english is decentralized, every speaker holds his/her own version of "english" in his/her own head and it's kept in sync with each other in order to be able to communicate ideas/concepts/informations etc...
Bitcoin is very similar, there is many copies of the ledger (in nodes instead of a speaker's head) and they're kept in sync to allow to communicate, not ideas, but the notion of value. It's a language.
I hope this analogy will help him to "get it" :)

If your wallet estimated it at 3 hours, it was an estimation given the circumstances at the time your transaction got sent, which are subject to change (it's like predicting the weather really).
You've got a few options to estimate the latest fee rates:


It depends. Some nodes forget unconfirmed transactions after a few days, some others (especially nodes used by miners) can retain it for far longer. One thing is for sure, is that as long as it's "out there", you cannot cancel it because you never know which nodes may remember it.
So if it's taking far too long and you want to boost it, you can use the RBF feature in your wallet to bump the fee and jump ahead in the queue.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:17:28
There's no feature like that at the moment. But some sort of automated channel management subsystem accessible from the BTCPay interface sounds like a nice idea!
About channel closures personally I prefer to avoid that as much as possible because channels are a valuable resource for a store. What would be amazing is an integration with [Loop Out]( to receive the balance on-chain every now and then if the threshold is reached while still keeping the channel opened and in fact re-balancing it to regain inbound liquidity.
The only exception where I'd close channels would be: there is a significant balance on my side (if it's 0 or a negligible amount I'm fine letting the channel sit in limbo) **and** the other node has been offline for a very long time **and** I need to access the money and can't do so from other channels.

I agree that should Satoshi wake up and decide to recover his old key (provided it still exists without data-loss) would probably require some data manipulation to extract it and convert it perhaps to WIF to be usable in modern wallets to access coins in the P2PKH address. But I believe data extraction and format conversion should well be within Satoshi's technical skill set.
It is true that his old wallet would not immediately recognize the p2pkh 1A1zP1... tho, he'll have to learn about all the coins sent there through other channels (like the extensive discussions about this address on various forums).
I'm glad that we eventually understood each other's points :)

Transaction confirmations work like a bidding system. You can attach a fee to your transaction (the amount is up to you). Miners select the highest bidding transactions first (which makes sense to them).
So if the network is not too busy, a low fee would get you confirmed fast. But if the network is overloaded (like today), you either have to wait until it cools down or pay a higher fee to get confirmed faster if you're in a hurry.
The fees are expressed in "satoshis per (v)byte". You can find estimations for different confirmation times here:
 [   
 [

You can bump the fees of your transaction at any time using RBF (if you sent the tx) or CPFP (if you received it).

I'm not an expert in Java stuff but from what I understood, if you have Eclair running right now and compiled it with Oracle's JDK you do not have to necessarily install OpenJDK before upgrading. You now have the option to choose but it seems like it should work in either case.

Usually if a wallet is a Segwit wallet it will be advertised as such ;)  
Some lets you create all types of wallets (like Electrum) so then you'll know which type of wallet it is because you'll have to choose one of the options when creating a wallet.
Otherwise, one way to recognize is to look at the address format, the prefix in particular:
* **1...** = Legacy (not Segwit), the most expensive.
* **bc1...** = Native Segwit, the cheaper.
* **3...** = \*maybe\* wrapped-Segwit (cheaper than legacy but more expensive than native-Segwit)
The particularity being that "bc1" addresses are not recognized by older wallets, so that's why the "wrapped-Segwit" addresses were created to provide a backwards-compatible solution. Although there is many other types of addresses that begin by "3" (like multisig) so you can't be 100% sure for these ones just by looking at the address.
I'm not an active user of these but from what I could find it seems like that both [BRD]( and [Coinbase]( implemented Segwit.

No, fees are not that high, between $0.11 to $1.00:  [ 
And you don't need to pay next block fees all the time. Merchants are used to wait months for credit card payments to fully "confirm", so the 24h fee is fine.

Yes it's pretty risk free as long as the amounts are correct for every output (and 0 for OP\_RETURN). But you definitely want to click on "Preview" first and quadruple-check that every output is correct before signing and sending.
About the padding, indeed you cannot enter less than a byte. So with "abc" it'll generate an error, "abcd" would work.
One final important info, if you enter for example `OP_RETURN abcd, 0` and then click "Preview", it'll show up as this in the Preview window (so don't be surprised):
`SCRIPT 6a02abcd`
It shows the complete script in hex format. So here it means:
* 6a: the opcode for "OP\_RETURN"
* 02: size of the payload data (2 bytes here)
* abcd: the payload (as many bytes as you want up to 80 B)
And thanks for the tip :)
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:44:53
You can do this with Electrum:
"Tools &gt; Pay to Many"
Then in the "Pay To" field, enter:
    (destination address), (amount)
    OP_RETURN (the arbitrary bytes you want to include in hex), 0
Then click on "Preview" and review everything before broadcasting.   
**&lt;!&gt; Ensure that the amount sent to OP\_RETURN is ZERO, otherwise the coins will be burnt and irrecoverable.**

Yes, Electrum is a perfectly legit wallet, BUT a couple words of caution:
* Only download from the **official website** (there's a lot of "impersonators" that actually install a modified version to steal coins):  [
* Installing Electrum on a computer connected to Internet is unsafe. Even if Electrum is fine in and of itself, your OS security could be compromised. One solution is to install Electrum on an "air-gapped" computer (a computer that's forever disconnected from any kind of network). It requires a little bit of work to setup correctly, especially to later safely transmit signed transactions to another online computer for broadcasting, so be sure to follow (and understand!) the manual:  [
* A simpler solution is to pair Electrum with a hardware wallet. The hardware wallet will hold and isolate the keys from the computer, so that's an additional layer of defense. Electrum will then just serve as an interface to view the wallet, the hardware wallet will serve to hold keys and sign transactions. But it requires to invest in the hardware first: two commonly recommended options are Trezor and Ledger.
* Backup your recovery seed somewhere safe on a physical support and far from prying eyes!

I've been wondering the same thing about where channel backups are stored in Google Drive.
After a bit of research it is indeed stored in application-private data. I've been able to see how much data there is by going to  [  then Cogwheel icon &gt; Settings &gt; Manage Apps, then it displays a few KB of data registered to Eclair.

Since the video is pretty long and technical, here's the gist of the idea:
Currently the Lightning Network relies on all nodes having a more or less complete map of the whole network, the sending node being responsible for running a path-finding algorithm (like Dijkstra's) to find a path to its destination. It currently works great for 8,541 public nodes and 36,519 public channels which is not a huge input for Dijkstra's algorithm by any means, so it still runs within a reasonable time.
But if in the future the network grows to have many more orders of magnitude public nodes and channels, it could become more challenging. This video presents the concept of an "ant routing" algorithm, taking as inspiration how ants solve routing to find food in a decentralized way using pheromone trails.
Each ant within a colony follows very simple actions and possess incomplete information about its environment, but their collective behavior exhibits an emergent intelligent behavior as a colony that is able to coordinate individual members to find efficient paths to food.
An algorithm inspired by this mechanism could allow Lightning nodes to find routes even if they do not have a complete view of the network while still preserving the anonymity of the sending and receiving parties.
Personally I find the idea interesting, but I'm mainly curious about what could be the potential attack vectors, could it resist within an adversarial environment?

The reward of the Genesis block is unspendable indeed. But all coins sent to the Genesis address afterwards are spendable on the other hand.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:58:02
Channels do not close on their own during normal operation, no matter how many times the balance shifts on both sides. They only close if you manually choose to (you, or the node on the other side of the channel), or if there's a protocol violation of some sort (the other side trying to steal for example).
So in your example, you start with channels that look like this:
|Channel with...|Your balance|Other party's balance|
After Dave finishes with his caffeine cravings, it will look like this:
|Channel with...|Your balance|Other party's balance|
After this, all channels are still operational and stay open. Your balance didn't change, you still own exactly 1 BTC, it just shifted to a different channel. You can still spend that 1 BTC through Dave's channel.
Other users can still use your channel with Starbucks in the other direction. Say Dave runs a successful freelancing business to fund his expensive caffeine addiction, so he invoices someone 1 BTC, which could arrive from the Starbucks channel and transit through your node before ending up in Dave's channel. In this case you'd be back to the initial state in the first table.
Or another way to replenish a channel is to perform a "[submarine swap]( you have some onchain BTC somewhere, you perform the swap to replenish your balance on Lightning, no need to close/re-open a channel.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:27:27
It'll probably go through eventually. Even if the mempool is often on fire these days there is still many instances of the 2 sat/b range being cleared every few days.
Be sure to enable RBF in case you get impatient if you want to update your fee later on ;)

I'm a Ledger user too and yeah the lack of advanced features in Ledger Live can be a pain sometimes, hopefully they'll improve the software over time.

Right, but spendability does not depend on wallet features but on protocol consensus rules (as in being able to be accepted by fully-validating nodes).
If someone holds the corresponding private key, then they can sign a valid transaction spending any UTXO based on the same public key, that makes the coins sent to this genesis public key - hashed or not - spendable (except the coinbase output in block 
If modern wallets do not allow you to do this, then it's pretty trivial to write a small script that does it.

    1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, 1.5
This example will both send 1.5 BTC to 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa (Genesis address here), and include the e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 hash (hash of an empty string here) in the transaction. It will also automatically create a 3rd output for the change if necessary.
The OP\_RETURN data won't be zero-padded, it'll just include as many bytes as you enter, up to the max of 80 bytes.
With "Pay to many" you can indeed create as many outputs as you need. The format is one output per line, and each line should be formatted as: `address, amount`
But as you can see "address" can also be an arbitrary script like OP\_RETURN xxx.

Who decided the amount of dropping: the protocol.
Every 2016 blocks, each Bitcoin full-node looks at each timestamp of the previous 2016 blocks, computes the average time between blocks, then they all compute by how much the difficulty has to evolve to bring the average back to 10 min (going down if it was &gt; 10 min, going up otherwise).
They all apply the same calculation on the same data (last 2016 blocks), so they all get the same result.

Was it a transaction that you sent or received?
You could just use RBF in the first case or CPFP for the latter. Probably less expensive than an accelerator, and no risk to get your fee bump stolen (an accelerator could take your money without doing anything to actually accelerate it).
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:01:18
Pending transactions are dynamic and cannot be forecasted with 100% accuracy (it's like the weather).
If an estimator told you that it was likely to confirm "within 5 hours" when the transaction was initially sent, it meant it was the estimation at that point in time, and may not be true anymore at present time if circumstances changed beyond what one could predict.
That's why you should refresh the latest estimations to take into account the most recent activity on the network.
Your transaction pays 34 sat/b in fees. On [bitcoiner.live]( the minimum estimated rate for a confirmation within 24h is 47 sat/b (at present time). So currently unless you bump your fee, chances are your confirmation could take more than a day.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:30:20
You can't know. Because there's no such thing as "the mempool" (as a singular entity). Every node got its own mempool, and each has its own configuration for mempool management. So in order to know this, you'd have to ask every single node owner to check their mempool, which obviously is not practical.
If your tx is stuck because of low fees, you don't have to wait for anything. Any modern wallet allows you to bump the fee at any time using RBF (Replace-By-Fee).
Alternatively you can also increase the fees from the receiving wallet using CPFP (Child-Pays-For-Parent).

Maybe try to import your private key into another wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:16:38
No, unconfirmed transactions are absolutely NOT safe here (otherwise we wouldn't need "confirmations" at all).
Even if a transaction cannot be deleted from the mempool, the sender can **very easily** replace it by another transaction to remove you as a recipient of the funds, after you've sent the cash. 
Moments after the transaction obtains 1 confirmation, it already becomes orders of magnitude safer.

You mean Satoshi wouldn't be able to find out the transactions sent to the hash of his genesis key (1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa)? That seems a little bit far fetched that he wouldn't know about it.
If he's still around and has the keys it would be extremely easy for him to write a script to scan for coins sent to this address and sign it.
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:19:52
Network fees do not depend on the value of the transaction. They depend on those factors:
* size of the transaction (in bytes). As I've explained in my other comment, it depends on the number of inputs and outputs. Although sometimes it can be bigger for some types of wallets (like multisig wallets which need to include more signatures, taking more space).
* fee rate (in satoshis/byte). This factor is up to you. You have total control over how much fee rate you set. But miners will process the transactions paying the highest fee rate first so it'll affect the speed of confirmation.
The total fees will equal "fee rate \* size".
One more thing to note, is that if you use a Segwit wallet, the bytes consumed by signatures (the "witness" data) will get a 75% fee reduction :)  
So for Segwit transactions, the formula is "total = feerate \* witness-bytes \* 0.25 + feerate \* other-bytes"

But by "genesis address" I meant any output using the public key    04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f  obviously (no matter if hashed or not, it requires the same private key either way) :)


But Satoshi (provided he's still alive and holding the corresponding private key) could still spend any later output based on this public key, no matter if P2PK or P2PKH, right?

At the protocol level, you can send from any type of address to any type of address, coins will never be lost ;)
The only thing that could happen is an older wallet that doesn't recognize newer "bc1..." addresses would think the address format is incorrect and won't even let you send coins.

Dude, chill out, where did I claim the block  output was spendable? Re-read my previous messages, I specifically said multiple times that this one is unspendable (not part of the UTXO set).
As for 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa there's not a thousand combinations. People sent a lot of coins to it. Those coins were sent after the Genesis block, so they are spendable (part of the UTXO set).
The private key of 1A1zP1... is the exact same as the private key corresponding to the P2PK output in the Genesis block.
So whoever owns the private key associated to the Genesis block, can spend coins in 1A1zP1..., that's as simple as that. You don't even need to write a custom script, just importing the corresponding private key in Bitcoin Core or Electrum would do.
You're right in that showing this address as the reward recipient of block  is an historical mistake by most block explorers, but that doesn't make it a "black hole" address either.

To put it in simple terms, a transaction is a list of "From:" coins, and a list of "To:" recipients of the money.
The more "From:" and the more "To:" there is, the bigger the data size of the transaction (in bytes).
I used the From/To analogy from emails but the actual names are "inputs" and "outputs".
One tricky thing is that your transaction may have one or more "inputs". It all depends over how many transactions you received the money you're about to send. Say you first received 1 BTC in a transaction and then 2 BTC in another. If you want to send only 1 BTC, you'll only have 1 input, because you only need to consume the coins from one previous transaction. If you want to send 3 BTC, you'll need 2 inputs, because you'll have to consume the coins from two previous transactions to get the necessary amount.

Bitcoin uses SHA256, not Scrypt for its mining algo.

Everything. Everything is being checked: all transaction scripts, signatures, merkle root, difficulty, proof-of-work, halvings, outputs &lt;= inputs, block reward &lt;= subsidy+fees etc...
The only exception is if "assumevalid=blockhash" is set, it will just skip script/signature verification for all ancestors of that block (but all other checks will still be performed) as an optimization to speed-up initial sync.


When it is included in a block that becomes accepted by the node. The transaction merely sitting in the mempool doesn't count.
It sounds like you might need to change your approach. Because when you "pre-verify" a transaction before accepting it in the mempool, it may still be subject to change: a new conflicting transaction might be submitted later on, or you might only hear about the conflicting transaction when you receive the next block.
I would suggest to isolate the outputs state in a well-defined "Chainstate" structure, which contains the current unspent outputs set (along with some metadata like last block height/hash/chainwork). Then when you receive a block, pass it through a "verifyBlock(block, current\_chainstate)" method, which will just return true/false if the block is valid or not (but won't actually change anything yet). If it returns true, create a "applyBlock(block, chainstate)" which will update the chainstate given the transactions in the block (removing the spent UTXO's, and adding new ones).
Then to handle reorgs, you might want to create another method "undoBlock(block, chainstate)", which will perform the exact inverse operation and restore the chainstate to the exact same state it was in before that block. This is because blocks can be orphaned every now and then, so you need a way to "rollback" the state, before moving forward again with the re-orging block (this can make previously "spent" outputs become "unspent" again).

Hi, I just released the source code of the underlying estimation engine here: [

Because people are overpaying fees. You don't need to pay the average fee to be included in a block, just the minimum fee.
Use smarter fee estimators:

Yes, that's correct.
