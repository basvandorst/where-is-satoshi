They future frequent articles on bitcoin both during ups and downs. Which is nice. HOWEVER. They always seem to interview or add on the meanings of Stephan Nilsson, head of the blockchain "union" in Norway , who among other things advocated segwit2x, which doesn't exactly line up with the majority opinion on the matter. This means they future the meanings of someone who's meanings maybe shouldn't be voiced as common knowledge or a voice of the general public, but it is what they and him made it seem like. It makes me worried that people who acquired an arbitrary position in an arbitrary company/website can voice their opinion as "gospel" without any criticism other my poor old self throwing some heat out in the comment section.

In my eyes, that's surprisingly low. What are all those other alt coins even for?

Maybe they're reimbursed by someone with an ulterior motive?

Say, "Suuuuure, I'll give you one m(under your breath)bitcoin." And when they turn 18, you'll give them one mBTC, have told the truth, and still be giving them loads of money. WinWin^^

I heard about it from a friend in 2013. He said "Hey, look at this thing that used to be worth like a dollar, it's now worth 200 dollars! We should buy some!" By the time the payment went through, it had crashed and was worth 75 USD. I went in with both feet, and looked at it like throwing money out the window, but maybe it rained back down sometime. I think it was just the right amount to not worry about losing it, but still enough to be proper thrilled during the 2013 bull ride to 1k USD. Had basically forgotten about it til now, only once in a while peeping at the price and noticing it was still alive:P
