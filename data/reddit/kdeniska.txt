As you can see the problem is that kraken has stopped all activities on my account, doesnt respond for 4 days. As a result of this a couldnt close my positions and prevent me from losses. 
They told me some months ago that I am a VIP customers and they provide a high-level service for me. That was untruth.

The problem is that they have block my ability to close my positions in time. I tried to do it all days along. 
I understand that they put on hold my funds but why I cannot close my positions?

I can easy save my positions by  adding more bitcoins and all  can be fine. But they stopped my trade ability without any explanation. And still keep silence. Really like the thieves.
Dear Kraken Team, if there any issues to discuss, why do you keep silence? Yoo know that you did a bad thing. Please prosecute a person from your stuff who did it.
