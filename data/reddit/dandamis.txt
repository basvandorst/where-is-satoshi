This sounds more stupid than a fucking Astrologer lol. 
"I can't predict the bottom but I can assure you that it WILL hit 19k and go further beyond, as hard as it may be for a lot of folks to believe right at this moment if you haven't been through it before."
Can't believe this gets upvoted, just goes to show that many crypto "investors" are just meme-following people. With your FUD &amp; HODL and other stupid memes lol. 
The amount of stupid advice I've seen on these kind of boards and in the comments is staggering. It's gotten to the point that it's just funny.

Bitcoin is still a rogue product, it's not a commodity like Corn, Oil, Lean Hogs, Gold, Silver etc. It's not even a decade old. Yet somehow many people believe it will keep rising and rising because of some limited supply?
There are plenty of things that can severely disrupt the bitcoin market, even making it obsolete:
- Other coins enter the market
- Governments will decide to make cryptocoins illegal
- Stupid energy costs associated with bitcoin
- Privacy issues
- Scams like bitconnect
- Skeletons in the closet (like market movers or insider trading)
- Hacks
- Advances in technology (quantum computing for instance)
And the list goes on and on.
Just because some crazy price rises have happened is not a reason At All that it will continue to happen. Also financial markets may never reach their all time high again. Also the price of bitcoin is determined using fiat currencies, to which a host of shit can happen that can make it hard to reach old $ price levels. 
All in all.. it's just a childs game and experiment, let's be honest with ourselves. This is not a true financial market, with a valid supply/demand logic, a worldwide adoptation and need. Nor is it free from influence of governments and such.

I've lived through plenty of crashes in financial markets, for many decades. Some markets recover, some don't, some take literally decades. For instance, in the Netherlands the main stock index is still 21% lower than the peak of the dot-com bubble.. which is 18 years ago. 
Just because these crazy jumps in price happened, doesn't mean that crazy jumps will keep happening..
