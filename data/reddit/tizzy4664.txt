Not terrible, depends what you are looking to do once you buy. If you want to buy and hodl, then go through all the KYC and withdraw to a cold wallet. If you leave it on there, just understand you're subject to the whim of the company if they lock or freeze your account. It's not super likely to happen, but a possibility when you dont control your own private keys.

Has anyone used this? I was looking at the "reviews" for the service and they all were very good of course but also ALL within the same time frame of each other. To me that seems shady, but could just be because it's new.

I've never tried it, it seems like to me it's a coinbase thing. It gets out my bank in a day, but still takes a week to go to CB. Seems silly in a world of fast transactions it takes so long, but better than paying the CB app fees

Awesome, thanks everyone I guess I'll give it a try then!

Mine usually takes a week or so. Theres a section under wallets where you can look at your deposits and it will show you the estimated arrival date.

Very insightful thought! Definitely have to go with the idea of teaching them to setup their own and moving the funds off whatever I gave them
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:08:54
Ahh yes, and when that time comes, it would also be a great lesson to teach!

Also does the computer auto boot from the stick or is there a key command I must enter during normal startup?
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:01:47
So with that, could I print from that interface if I wanted to go the paper wallet route? My only concern with relying on USB is of USB then becomes antiquated.
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:41:47
Just looked at that, very interesting. If I understand it correctly it's basically a USB device that has a one time use (basically) reveal of its private key and that's how btc is spent? My only concern is( obviously I would also look more into it) : does it require any kind of firmware or software, what happens if it gets wet or cracks or something, does it have the potential of becoming outdated and unsupported?

Young, toddler and younger right now. I want to start early with them. I had that idea but thought would that be super lame? I imagine it as an uncle saying you I'll keep 20 for you.
I was thinkin for now I would give it to the parents, and when they are older and can understand we could do it together and they would have some btc to learn with and do whatever with. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:21:22
I think literally just about anything is possible in crypto, and definitely would be something I'd have to assess if such things would ever start coming about. With my luck I'd catch it at like a dollar.
That said even if that happens all their little bday money is useless, I dont think blockchain is going anywhere and hopefully could still teach them about it.

The fact the she plans to increase fees on financial transactions is the point, makes bitcoin even better. Much harder to tax peer to peer or anon transactions than traditional financial means, or even centralized peer to peer like PayPal and such

"The Warren campaign's detailed Medicare-for-all proposal, however, insists that the costs can be covered by a combination of existing federal and state spending on Medicare and other health care -- as well as myriad taxes on employers, financial transactions, the ultra-wealthy and large corporations and some savings elsewhere. "
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:35:43
That's a great idea, do you know of a reputable wallet generator. Also would I basically just copy and paste the keys into the read me file?
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:51:43
I will check it out thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:51:03
I am not, but am willing to learn! Thanks that seems pretty easy and secure.
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:46:56
That's an excellent point! For now they are super young (4 and under) so I was hoping by the time they get to that point they would have a nice little store, and I don't have to worry about getting their stuff mixed in with mine
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:56:02
Handling the keys as in, they may be accessible to unsavory characters on the internet or is the implication me lol
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:53:49
I agree, and it wouldn't be the only gift. True I would not have enjoyed, but at 20 or 30 I certainly might look back and be thankful I did.
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:12:58
Will do, I'm liking this option! Thanks for the help
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:10:19
�� good thing we arent dealing in treasury bills then!
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:59:27
And with a device like this, I could then just send btc to the public address each year? One concern I have too, as someone else mentioned 20 years may be too long to look down in tech terms. Will USB itself become obsolete like a floppy disk
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:48:40
Awesome thanks!! I appreciate the help
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:48:23
I have not used a Trezor, and have used Ledgers. I like the Ledger alot, however for deep cold storage they can be a pain in the butt to do the firmware updates when you havent done them in a long time. So if you get one, just make sure you update it when new firmware comes out.
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:26:48
I appreciate the advice and I'll look into that one as well. Since I dont know either I'll do my research and go off what I conclude about both. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 04:48:07
They prob will, they are really young, and their parents are of the btc is a scam mindset, so I want to get them on the path to enlightenment!
