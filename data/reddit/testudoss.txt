Why is everyone here all of a sudden in favor of a blocksize increase?
Do you all realize that segwit is a blocksize increase, and therefore has all the same disadvantages of blocksize increases?
The only reason people should be using segwit is for lighting.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:40:36
Nobody on these threads have answered my important point about segwit. 
Segwit is a blocksize increase. Why is it a good idea to increase the blocksize by using segwit, if lighting isn't here yet? 
Sure, use segwit for lighting. But stop polluting the blockchain with your big blocks! 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:26:34
It is funny that you disagree with the developers.  
Why don't you take your own advise and listen to the consensus from the developers?  And the developers believe that you should probably only use segwit for lightning.  Using it now just increases the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:17:12
This is incorrect.  segwit increases the blocksize, and thats why fees are less.  It does not make transactions smaller.  
You 'might' be thinking of schnorr signatures, which reduces the size of multi-sig transactions.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:51:35
It is really difficult to tell these days....
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:26:19
Thats EVERY day here...

Most of the core devs oppose a blocksize increase.  It makes the network less decentralized.
People not using segwit means that the blocksize stays small, which is good for the network.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:46:08
But do you see the contradiction that I pointed out?
If a single honest node is all that is needed to run the bitcoin network, then it doesn't matter if 90% of the nodes are own by one party, correct?
Having 100s of thousands of nodes owned by decentralized parties wouldn't matter if 1 node, your node, is all that is needed.
Either node decentralization matters or it doesn't.

What in the world is a lightning token?
Lighting isn't an ICO.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:15:10
It does not make transactions smaller.
It increases the blocksize via a soft fork.  That is why fees are less, because it is a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:44:22
The core devs are opposed to extension blocks.  They said so when Joseph Poon and JJ proposed it.
So I don't think extension blocks will happen, as the bitcoin experts don't think it is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:29:21
Umm, I don't think we should be submitting fake reports to target other people's twitter accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:47:00
Storage costs was never the bottleneck, lol. 
Terra byte hard drives sell for 20 bucks or so. 
The bottleneck is bandwidth! 
And segwit increases your bandwidth. 
Edit: here is proof 
As you can see, an official core developer has stated that segwit is a blocksize increase, and that you shouldn't use it if you support small blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:08:56
Segwit is a blocksize increase.
Yes, it actually increases the blocksize, via a soft fork.
Every Core developer will tell you that.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:38:24
Why in the world would it be a good idea for them to implement segwit? 
Segwit is a blocksize!  That will increase the blocksize and make the network less decentralized. 
The only point of using segwit is for lighting. No lighting, then don't destroy the blockchain with your big blocks! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:31:31
But 0 conf is optional.
IE, nobody is forced to accept 0 conf.  It is just optional for anyone who wants it.
How can an optional feature, that was active on the bitcoin network for years, break anything?
Well, actually, 0 conf isn't even a "feature" it is just behavior.  Anyone can accept 0 conf transactions on the bitcoin network right now.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:59:21
Which real life merchants use lighting right now?
Do you know of any real life merchants working towards accepting it in the future?
If the answer to these questions is No, how long do you believe until there is a singular major merchant on board?
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:17:00
Ummm, are you a core developer?
Because why should your opinion be trusted over the core developers?
Big blocks increase centralization.
Which means that small blocks, make the network better.  Stop supporting big block segwit, and start supporting experts like Luke.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:34:40
You seem to be confused. 
Segwit is a blocksize increase. Yes, yes it is. 
Why are you arguing that coinbase should bloat the blocksize of the network by implementing segwit? 
Segwit should ONLY be used for the lightning network. That's it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:47:20
Ummm, you are wrong.
Segwit is literally a blocksize increase.  
The official segwit faq even says so.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:49:23
At the cost of the network. It makes nodes more expensive, and therefore less decentralized. 
Don't be a big blocker! The core devs have explained multiple times why big blocks are bad.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:38:07
In the post that you made, don't you say that as long as there is a singular honest node, that bitcoin works?
Which is it?  Is a singular honest node enough to keep bitcoin running, or is it important that 90% of nodes aren't controlled by 1 party?
Because both of these statements can't be true at the same time.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:12:33
Another disadvantage is that it is a blocksize increase, and therefore comes with all the same problems as any other blocksize increase.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:11:09
... Do you understand that segwit is a blocksize increase?
You are advocating for a hard fork blocksize increase....
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:14:05
Just because something will never be "finished" doesn't mean that you can't track progress.
There are still metrics that you can track.  Merchant adoption is one of them.
Metrics are important because they can give us estimates about the future.
For example, the amount of merchants using the LN right now, is ~0.  
If at the end of 2018, that number stays at ~0, well it means that we've got problems.  And it is important to know if we have problems or not.
For another example, look at segwit.  segwit usage has stayed around ~10% after 5 months.  Thats a problem, that unfortunately the core developers didn't warn us about.
What people are asking for is for the devs to make predictions.  To be transparent.  To put it all out on the table.  And unfortunately the LN devs have been very untransparent with their predictions.  If LN is going to take another 2 years, then the community needs to know.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:19:46
Because it increases the blocksize and makes the network less decentralized. That's why not to do that. 
The core devs have explained multiple times why big blocks are bad. And segwit is a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:51:41
Thats because they weren't "ready".
Optimistic people in the community misinterpreted what they said, in order to get the political points from having lots of companies that were claimed to be "segwit ready!".
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:00:06
Segwit is not sgnorr signatures, or whatever it is that this is called. 
The new signatures save space for multi Sig transactions, but that is different than segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:22:13
You don't need segwit network wide in order to use lightning.
You can just use it yourself.  
So if another party is not using segwit, it doesn't effect you at all.  The only reason to use segwit is for lighting.  And if lightning isn't ready yet, don't use segwit.
Using segwit without lightning is just a blocksize increase, and there is no reason to do that if you support lighting.
Go listen to the developers.
" If you support reducing the block size (good for Bitcoin), avoid using Segwit for normal transactions. Only use Segwit for Lightning. "
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:52:46
Thats awesome!
Which merchant Point of Sale locations use lightning?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:41:51
Why in the hell would we want people moving over to LTC?
It has ALL the same disadvantages as any other blocksize increase altcoin, AND the main creator/developer just left.
People need to look at the freaking fundamentals.  LTC is just as bad, and no amount of political "oh, Charlie is friends with the core devs!" changes that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:03:25
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  So it negatively effects the network in all of the same exact ways that a blocksize increase does.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:19:37
You don't need coinbase to implement segwit.  You can use segwit yourself, for whatever lightning network usecases you want, right?
If coinbase starts using segwit, that is just a blocksize increase, which many prominent core developers oppose.  
Ex: Lukejr, a popular core developer thinks that blocks are already to  big.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:00:05
It is a blocksize increase.  Which means that it has all the same cons as any other blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:16:19
Why is this a good thing?
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  So it comes with all the same negatives as any other blocksize increase.
One of the most prominent core developers even believes that the blocksize was already too large before segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:16:05
What about ch_jj, the creator of bcoin, a major bitcoin client alternative?  He was fairly pro segwit2X back when it was a thing.  He gave the segwit2X side, during a bitcoin debate, run by the san francisco bitcoin meetup group.
He also worked with Joseph Poon, the original lightning network creator, on extension blocks, which was another blocksize increase proposal.
Does ch_jj, and Joseph Poon, the original lightning network developer count in your definition of "technical parties"?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:03:52
Why should anyone support ANY blocksize increases?
Thats what lite coin is.  It is just the same exact thing as bitcoin cash, except that the main dev is friends with the core devs.
Look at the fundamentals.  Don't support an altcoin just because the person who made it has good things to say about Core.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:24:45
Sure, but I still think people should be honest about how far along things are.
IE, if it isn't going to be ready for another 2 year at least, then people should just say that.  
Just say "yeah, possibly like 2 years if we are being very optimistic, but probably longer", because that seems to be the truth of the matter.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:52:18


Why would we want to escape this?
High fees are an intended feature of the market.  The core team literally wants fees to be high, as it is necessary to secure the market.
High fees are the whole point of a censorship resistant network.  If you want low fees, you will have to go to some altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:06:16


Why is this a real an life-threatening issue?
According to bitcoin core, fees are a healthy part of the ecosystem, and we won't need a blocksize increase for years.
When did that change?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:40:11
You guys know that segwit is a blocksize increase right??
I feel like I am taking crazy pills.  Why are you guys supporting a blocksize increase?
The ONLY benefit of segwit is the lightning network.  If it does have that, then it is the same as any other blocksize increase with all the disadvantages.
The more people that use segwit right now, the higher the blocksize!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:01:22
You are wrong.
Go read the official segwit FAQ:
Segwit IS a blocksize increase.  Every single core developer in the world will tell you that.  The official bitcoin authority on the matter, and the people who created segwit, disagree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:19


Isn't that what bitcoin . cash is?  
Segwit is currently at 8% usage rate after 4 months.  Won't lightning have teh same slow adoption rate?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:59:57
Umm, you are wrong.
Segwit IS a blocksize increase.  It was a SOFT FORK blocksize increase.
It says so right in the official FAQ:  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:38
Umm, don't we WANT people to use bitcoin?  
I that that was the entire point?  For businesses to use us.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:13:26


Are you aware that segwit is a blocksize increase?
Therefore it has ALL the same disadvantages as any other blocksize increase?
Everyone using segwit just increases the blocksize..... And you can just go read anything that any core developer has said about the disadvantages of THAT.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:07:53
Why?  Segwit is a blocksize increase.  It comes with all the negatives and drawbacks that any other blocksize increase would.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:02:32
Why would this even matter?  Segwit is a blocksize increase.
If you increase the blocksize via segwit, you get all the the drawbacks of a blocksize increase.
The Core developers don't even care that much about whether people are using segwit right now or not.  It is all about the lightning network that is going to release X years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:11:56
Well it would be whatever the bitcoin core team claims to happen when a blocksize increase happens.
Segwit is a blocksize increase in the same way of any other blocksize increase.
Are you claiming that the Core team was wrong about the negative side effects of a blocksize increase, or something?
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:40:01
\&gt;  They haven’t even released what the bug is though.   
What?  yes it was released.  Lightning nodes don't do the right verification on transactions.  So you can just make a bad transactions, and a lightning node will accept it.  And then you steal their money.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:30:31
People are currently losing money on mainnet using c-lightning .
I'm not sure what the bugs are specifically, but it was in the news 2 months ago, so I bet the issues are still real.
Here is a link to a bug regarding real money loss that is still open: 
Are you going to take back your statement on " "Lightning is not secure" is just wrong.".
Do you still believe it is OK to ban people for saying something that is quite clearly a subjective opinion and not factually incorrect?
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:07:34


Thats literally what he is saying.  That people should stay away because of the huge risks.  Specifically the most recent risk of a bug that could have caused a loss of funds.
