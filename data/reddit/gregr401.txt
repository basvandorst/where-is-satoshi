No, he is acting as a BUSINESS.  Huge difference.

douche troll ... douche troll alert.  Let me guess, you were all for the 2008 financial crash too, huh?  Yea, that gravy train of no regulation worked real well, huh.

That's a bit simplistic.  He is acting as a business, which is the most important aspect, in addition to a virtual currency being returned in a physical representation.  That can easily be construed as an 'exchange', even though it is not being changed to a different currency format.

Agreed, maybe someone else might have some historical api data available for review?
Keep us in the loop!

He is a 'business' performing a service which FINCEN deems money / currency.  This is good!  It helps legitimize bit coin in the US.

So you would leave the country instead of having BUSINESSES follow regulations that in place to help protect us?  All he has to do is register...  Sure that costs money, BUT ALL BUSINESSES have expenses.
Just wow.

Totally agree!  Just wondering when the first Indian exchanges come online :)

Cool...  Adios... Sayonara ...  Peace!   You have fun continuing to pay taxes while you ex-patriot and deal with any countries issues. 
Some of us actually try and make a difference, while futile as it may seem.

Care to enlighten the world?  Just pure stammering?
Can you not read between the lines that this move actually helps LEGITIMIZE bitcoin by establishing that businesses need to follow the same letter of the law as existing firms?  It would be more valid to argue that they aren't a 'financial exchange' rather that businesses shouldn't adhere to existing laws.   
Yay 2008, here we come again....  Personally, I made a killing, so fuck everyone else, right???
