I saw a sticker with "flat earth - water cannot curve". So many lols

I highly recommend the S, it's a U2F key as well!

If by sidelines you mean hodling other crypto

I look forward to the documentary on all this bullshit (both sides of this debate) coming out in a few years time once we all know for sure what's going on.
I got out b/c I can't tell what's real on either side, you're all as shady as each other.

Hello, I'm a real life person who believes this. In my opinion btc can't avoid been ruined by the humans on both sides of the btc/btu bullshit, and I sold all my coins for eth. I'm not the only one, judging by the prices.

Hey, just FYI your site seems a bit broken on mobile safari  (and my inline Reddit client)

He's cautiously optimistic!

But Finland isn't part of Scandinavia, something smells fishy here

It's probably policy to reject any photo which has been obviously altered in any way. They might want to use image forensic tools to identify edits/manipulation which becomes harder if you've put a watermark on it.

All these unconfirmed transactions blowing around

Why don't you log into your email on something that isn't a phone that makes it easy to select all -&gt; mark read?

Sorry, how do you use bitcoin without broadcasting your transaction to the network?
Sure you can run clients that don't need to have a copy of the blockchain and keep it up to date, but you still need to be able to send transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:28:11
In what way? Perhaps I missed something that happened before I started using it.
You can use it to send and receive BTC, which would seem to meet your spending-btc-without-jailbreaking requirement.

If you're undecided on your next ISP I can highly recommend AAISP. I switched to them after reading  a while back.

Blockchain has previously estimated over 9 hours for a feeless payment of mine. In reality it was confirmed in about 30 minutes.

Are you sure? Every time you make a wallet change (generate a new address, for example) you get a backup email, assuming you didn't turn that off.
Just because your last email might have been made before a payment to an address on blockchain.info doesn't make it worthless. It still has the private keys needed to send those coins somewhere else.

Thanks for the tip! Looks like a good alternative.

I like the tiny Mars label just in case you weren't sure what it was.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:13:57
Ouch, papercuts.

Mining is definitely not worth it for the individual now. You should also never buy anything from Butterfly Labs. They'll certainly ship your order... in a year, when network growth renders it useless.
@_date: 2013-06-19 08:18:33
That is not an offline wallet.

Looks great apart from what looks like scissor-cut eges in pic 8. I'd want to invest in a small guillotine if I was already paying for professional printing.
I've got some some of these printed out and stowed away (plus the stickers!), but they're terribly quality inkjet :(

The sentence "It's not a pyramid scheme!" never comes out right, y'know?
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:00:04
OK, I picked a bad example to say that about. Certainly building some things on top of the blockchain adds value, and this may be one of them.
The thread being about bitcoin "startups" I assumed you meant cloning the existing company. I stand by my point that if that's all that any new company accepting bitcoin is doing then they are unlikely to succeed.
You seem to have given the rideshare idea some thought, how exactly would you implement that on the blockchain? I'm struggling to see it.

I tried running bitcoind on my raspberry pi for a while. I gave up after a week of trying to download/verify the blockchain. It kept running the pi out of memory (with bitcoind getting OOM'd) and eventually corrupted its blockchain storage shutting down uncleanly.

"Like X but with bitcoin!" ideas are most likely doomed to fail when original company X sees them and adds bitcoin support.

Maybe the 5 key on BFL's keyboard is faulty and they've been trying to say 52 weeks all along.

I also prefer *Heineken Social Media Intern* over just *Heineken*.
