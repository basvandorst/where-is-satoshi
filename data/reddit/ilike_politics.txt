I will be. My machines are locked down fully encrypted, and I do not install anything dodgy in my machines. I also use Virtual Machines extensively, and have encrypted offline backups. I fully agree with the  be careful part. Thanks!

It's all of 6 cents. I am simply trying to understand by "doing", and asking questions. I need to understand the risks properly before I will use or move around any serious funds.
So 12oKS9MmbgjQnEnRSqTzQjKAPB3TJYJeKr is NOT mine. It belongs to Circle. They will just redirect BTC coming in to that address to my name in their internal ledger. Well, that was the defect in my understanding and it is cleared up now. Thanks!
Yeah, I am just going to get a offline wallet, with addresses that I own and hold the private keys to. I don't think online wallets are for me.

I understand the risks on the desktop. I will need to come up with something that mitigates the risk of being compromised as well as me simply losing the private keys. I should be able to do both.
And thanks for letting me know the wallets you use, and your preference. It will make it easier for me to settle on something. I do not plan on installing anything on my phone at this time. It is a risk I am simply not comfortable with. Maybe later.

Yes, but using a credit card (as a buyer, which is what vast majority of us are), I always have my bank go bat for me when a merchant tries to pull a fast one. How would I enforce that if I pay for something with *coin, and product never shows up? Who do I call?
