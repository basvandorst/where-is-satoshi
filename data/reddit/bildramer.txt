Maybe that was the point.

German here, I could set my clock to the trains, if it's one of those days when they actually appear.

"You need *&lt;currency&gt;* to get into *&lt;currency&gt;*"
...something isn't right here.

I have some bad news for you.
@_date: 2014-07-13 16:04:54
I don't think anyone believed the family story, from the beginning.

The one thing that's important is that nobody can make up lots of fake passengers/drivers/CAs, not the incentives of these parties. Someone who's willing enough can pretend to be good for months then just stop, either way.

That's exactly right. Do you think you're making fun of it simply by stating it? I'm not borderline retarded, so my coins are secure, and I don't really care about other people.

It's not anonymity, it's just not trusting other people with your money.

"punish savers and reward borrowers"
Why do I find that a little hard to believe?
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:17:23
Don't just pick that's centralization and it adds perverse incentives, e.g. making alts and posting your posts there, or mod corruption, or other things I can't think of. People will do anything for the smallest rewards.

It's called "humor". You may have encountered it before.

Are you having a stroke?

The [Kardashev]( scale puts us at 0.7. We've never detected any other civilizations. Kaku is a complete nut, pulling long-term predictions about the future from thin air. Never let people sell you their ideas for &gt;2 decades in the future.

Also identifiability: it's easy to thin it a little.

I've heard of it but haven't looked it up; I assumed "divisibility" meant they used lower amounts than whole bottles.
