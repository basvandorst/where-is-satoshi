To remind those who care about price.

But fiat is already internationally accepted everywhere. Since we are born we have been using fiat so none care how it works as long as they can get what they want. Bitcoin is totally a new thing, only `elite` will get it. The average person has no time to care for this new system as long as they can buy the food they want, the travel etc..

This is actually on-track with the anime anon prediction

It means we are still early

We are woke so we can see that. Normal everyday people dont even care about the stock market or the economy. As long as they have salary they are good

Don’t worry, they will be interested and come to you again when we reach another new ATH

I think the 1.5 trillion dollar market cap refers to Bitcoin only, not including the whole crypto. That will be around $84,000 per bitcoin if 1.5 trillion dollar market cap refers to Bitcoin only which is in line with his Nov 2020 prediction

Who knows we might dip to 9200 end of July and then go up from there

So what you mean is that depreciation is good. But MYR depreciates way too much to be a good currency. Of course it is not to the level seen on Zimbabwe or Venezuela level yet but still that is way too much to be a good currency. 
If you go to any currency exchange in most of the major cities you won’t see the MYR pairing but you will see SGD, Thai Baht, Euro etc..

But MYR cant appreciate like Bitcoin has in a bull run

Of course I am bull long term. But I think that will be riot and chaos the day when BTC becomes mainstream or when USD become meaningless. 
See, those no-coiners surely will start riot and loot and kill anyone deem to have lots of BTC. If and when BTC is the main currency and of course those no-coiners will riot. They will be jealous of those early adopters of Bitcoiners. Unless salary is paid out in BTC, then everyone can have a hold of it.

Only if it reaches $1 million before 31st Dec 2020

If dollar gets hyperinflated it is good for bitcoiners. It means those who hold only dollar have less purchasing power as their dollar can buy less stuff than what they have now. It means the transfer of wealth is made from fiat to Bitcoin. Those who moved from fiat to Bitcoin profits the most. That`s why institutional and goverment are secretly accumulating Bitcoin.

Bitcoin went from single digit dollars in 2012 to almost 10k now in just 7 years. almost 1000x increase but no one says USD is  hyperinflated.

If he buys all the Bitcoin then Bitcoin will be no value as he is the only one holding the coin. The public must have Bitcoin too for it to be worth anything as it is called `exchange of value`
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:23:24
Will hit $10k next month. And It will just keep going up until $100k before it crashes back down to around $20k
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:12:38
Do you still think 2.5k will come with BTC @ almost 9k now?
