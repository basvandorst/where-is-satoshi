Somewhere you should have a copy of your wallet backup file. which would be this place you specified upon setting up multibit. Go into the folder then there would be a load of .info files search using *info to bring up files that have the extension and right click on them and open with notepad. It should say at the top keep these keys private something like that. There is a video I used that shows how to export and import private key but have a look here 
You can redownload the software for exporting give this a try here
