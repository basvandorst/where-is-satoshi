He also missed out on all the tech booms avoiding internet and technology related investments historically. Hmmm.

This includes NPR.

Just pointing out that his opinions on most things technology-related even he admits, he stays clear from and in terms of providing opinions. It's ok that his opinions are valued far less in certain contexts.

Big banks and large investment houses like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (of which Buffet injected $5B into during the 2008/09 crisis) are using him as a last resort to defame the name of Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the largest threat to their fleecing of the world they have ever seen.

So Bitcoin is like Gold? Your Technical Analysis is powerless around here.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:06:55
Yes, rely on his opinion outside of anything technology related, as he also advises.

If they were 100% correct they would have said As a currency, Bitcoin is the point AND could change the world
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:13:22
A lot of inaccurate points there. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:46:30
Factor the increased value in the currency and the outcome changes.

Unfortunately, public perception has been swayed to the negative side, as he knew it would by issuing that statement that he also knew the media would pick up on and propagate. Not good.

Agreed, not instantly, but comparing to when the initial operation started lets say when they worth $1000 each.

He could have made a lot more by not ignoring tech. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:34:09
To the contrary, this is the beginning of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-03 16:14:47
He still missed out on the tech boom and has made some serious mistakes including a lot of stuff like this

1998 "Buffett won't invest in tech stocks" 
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:24:00
Buffett won't invest in Apple or Google: "I just don't know how to value them." So, apparently he understands and knows how to value Bitcoin.  
It's a Trap!

    Ah yes. Goldman Sachs. One of the chief architects of the 2007 financial crash by advising their customers to buy toxic debt - then betting against them I'd trust them in a heartbeat!

    JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are completely threatened by digital alternative currencies. JP Morgan is paying lobbyists to quash these currencies -  - while at the same time BTC represents potential annual Retail, E-Comm, Remittance savings of +$210 billion.  while they are praising it in other circles... 
    JP Morgan also filed a patent on a bitcoin killer... 
    They are scared of these currencies because they threaten the very livelihood of their being or soon to be lack thereof.

    CloudHashing.com Prepares $20 Million-a-Month Bitcoin Mining Operation and none of it goes to Goldman Sachs because they don't get it like Solomon Brothers didn't get the Internet.

Not the kind of instant I was talking about. Instant decrease by 1/2 of course, but non-instant in terms of value appreciation.
