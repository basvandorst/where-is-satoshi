Because it's socially constructive to punish bad behavior, I might be a little idealistic on this but I've sued for 500 dollars, hell, the least I sued was for a 25 dollars ticket, it's more about not letting criminals indulge in my money than the amount sometimes.

Seems you don't know how the court of law works, you don't lose more money, the party that loses pays the legal fees, thus you get everything back, it's just that you have a little money tied up for the duration of the trial. So basically you scam me for $500 and don't want to pay after a personal mediation, you'll have to pay both the $500 and my lawyers. Rather recoup my losses and at the same time making money than write off a huge loss, it's not like I can't make money during the trial, that's what lawyers are for, to represent you, it takes a couple of hours to tell em what it's about and give em the documents and a call every two weeks to see what's happening.
I'm not blaming the victims for nothing and saying they deserve to be robbed, I'm blaming them for not fulfilling their duty to protect their investment eventhough they have all the tools available to do so.

At first I was outraged by this, but now I believe people deserve it, if you're too lazy to sue after you got stolen I say it's fair play.

The party that loses pays the legal costs, you could even short btc in the process and make a nice profit of it.

reasonable effort means contacting, if they refuse to answer it is their problem, you have done what's in your power to negociate.
