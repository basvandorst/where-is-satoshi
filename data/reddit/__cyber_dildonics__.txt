A smaller block _maximum_ might be a sensible move, but the caps you are talking about extremely US centric.  Dozens of countries have hugely better internet than the US. Data caps aren't a result of any technical barrier, simply a lack of competition.   Most people won't download the whole chain, but it is technically a possibility for most.
The internet right now is about video, plain and simple.  Right now and for a few years at least, the block chain pales in comparison to YouTube, Netflix, torrents, etc.  for most people.  It takes me around 10 minutes once every couple of days to sync with the block chain.  This isn't going to suddenly change.  The block size is a limit, not what every block comes through as.
Also people could flood the network with cheap transactions now if they want.  Instead of 100 dollars every 10 minutes it would cost about 2000 dollars every 10 minutes.   That's 288,000 per day.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:06:14
Because it is extremely simple.  Anything needs to be tested thoroughly.   This isn't the time to be fancy in the slightest.  Much bigger blocks will buy a lot of time to do something slightly fancier.  While that may be trivial in code, it takes time to test and attack.
@_date: 2015-06-27 00:57:41
But why approach it from that angle and not use working code to test the limits of what is practical?
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:59:59
Miners would need to have a cut off for the fee they are willing to include.  No more free transactions. Or free transactions would be something of a gamble where a miner would only include so many.

Remember, if every block was 20MB, it would take 34 KB/s to keep up.  This is slightly out of reach for someone who is syncing with the block chain exclusively from the free international roaming bandwidth available in over 100 countries on a T-Mobile cell phone plan.
If you can watch a video on YouTube, you can sync with 100% 20MB blocks easily.  
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:57:27
Holy shit, that is a terrible implementation then.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:56:50
I don't think this is true.  A smart card that can sign transactions can act as a hardware wallet.  Then it can be more like a debit card in very simplistic terms. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:48:44
How would an attack that forces block sizes down work?  Wouldn't that take a majority of the mining power?
Mean + median is an interesting idea, since a bigger block would presumably inflate the average but possibly deflate the median size as transactions are included in it but not other blocks.  I also wonder about miners needing to pay a fraction of the median non zero transaction fee for every transaction they include so that there is disincentive to artificially enlarge a block.
Of course all of this is counter to my original post that working tested implementations are really the only thing anyone should be trying to really agree upon.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:03:50
That's a somewhat fair point, but unlimited  is very ripe for abuse. Someone with lots of bandwidth could cause a lot of problems, especially when the network is starting out (which is familiar now that I spell it out...)
Even if the average user doesn't use the full chain, an unlimited block size  would mean that it takes a lot of resiliency to use the full chain, which isn't good either.  People running a full wallet or full node on a home connection is entirely possible now, and I think it likely will be from here on out, but if there is an obvious place to abuse in the system, it will be abused.

What bottlenecks are there right now that people are up against? This idea that 20MB blocks take some sort extreme resources is ridiculous.  That is 34 KB/s MAX.  Only years from now when 20MB blocks start filling up will the bandwidth needed be 34 KB/s.   
There is no bottleneck, no one needs to be saved by moores law.  If you use YouTube, you can already deal with 20MB blocks, which again won't fill up anytime soon.

I like the idea of the 2 * median block size over the past month.
Ultimately the way it should be approached though is not by haphazard brainstorms and proposals (as above).  It should come down to working implementations that people can criticize by demonstrating real attacks.  Then the choices will be limited and the effects will be much more clear.
Theorizing is not what got us here, _working code got us here_.  Even now that bitcoin is clearly working people scream that it won't work!

While I certainly don't doubt that what you are saying is true, I'm just trying to give some perspective to people who have bandwidth concerns over syncing to the blockchain that are based on gut feelings and not numbers.  
If that is a distraction from running full nodes, then it must be a bigger problem than I realized, but is running a full node a major technical hurdle now?
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:16:19
And then who adopts that new software?  If it is the same mining method, the majority of the hashing power will dictate the correct state of the block chain.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:39:02
Less restriction up to the point of doing more bad than good, which is a judgement call that can be only made in hindsight. But largely it seems very true that artificial limitations put on bitcoin will put bitcoin in the same scenario as what it is replacing - artificially limited, not technically limited.   
I am thinking now that the most plausible scenario of an altcoin may be that someone creates it out of bitcoin with the entire blockchain in tact.  They start a new currency that picks up where the old ledge lets off.  Then part of the network effect of bitcoin would be canceled out.  Miners would gradually start to mine both if the algorithms were the same.

I never said no block limits.  If an altcoin with no limits splits off and gets spammed with huge blocks it won't be very attractive either.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:29:46
What do you think about letting miners vote on either an increase or decrease with every block?  Then the maximum block size would be dynamic and something that miners can actively participate in and come to a consensus on rather than being locked into decisions that were made in the past?
A %50 increase or %33 decrease with every block would give equal weights to both sides while still using a percentage.  This would enable miners to set their own target maximum block sizes and influence the number in their direction with every block they mine.
Conceivably they would be able to set what they think should be a minimum transaction fee and adjust their target maximum block size to the minimum that would allow that given the current state of transactions at any one time.

Yeah... international undersea fiber cables carry massive amounts of data and there are hundreds.  Look at real numbers and use some common sense. International bandwidth was never going to be the bottleneck.  
In addition to this, the block size debate is over the division between bitcoin's block chain and other methods of transactions.  No one is talking about actually using less total bandwidth.

Some technologies comes in early yet are not refined enough and don't evolve. Some technologies have extremely long lives due to getting it 'right enough' the first time.

There are first movers who flop, first movers who dominate, and lots of grey areas in between, so really I think history doesn't offer a clear answer to whether an better crypto-currency could upset bitcoin.  There are many many factors.

I think it's hilarious that people think there is a possibility of bitcoin collapsing because of one incompetent exchange that transitioned out of trading magic the gathering cards.  
No matter the price of bitcoin, there is tremendous momentum for adoption, which makes it worthwhile.  Bitcoin's worth is defined by adoption and infrastructure as it applies to the world's population, contrasted by it's competition from other crypto-currencies.  Bitcoin at 0.01 and a network of ATMs will still destroy Western Union, revolutionize small scale international finance, facilitate anonymous black markets, invigorate the porn industry, etc. etc.     Bitcoin used to be what we would consider now to be 'worthless' and it still completely changed the landscape of black market drug trade.
Bitcoin's implications don't need your confidence. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:53:37
Theory as it may be I would guess you are right that the price would move.  But if it did, wouldn't that mean that overall the price to buy 10 million USD worth of BTC would actually be lower than 10 million USD? If you moved the price, the cheaper coins you bought would rise in value. When you are done buying, unless the price sinks immediately you can transfer that balance.  If the other person flash sells, then yes the dynamic might swing in the other direction.
Fundamentally I won't know why transferring huge amounts of money is really the sole or core utility of a currency though.  Bitcoin is already facilitating many types of transactions, some new, some more refined than before.  Why is a huge value transfer such a big deal other than one possible use?

If there are wide open vulnerabilities,  why not scrape all the information off of people's phones and use parts of it to expose those vulnerabilities?  Many people really do care about privacy, the problem is that it is very abstract and people don't really believe they are having their privacy invaded.    If it is shown that Samsung has massive vulnerabilities, then people will look at their phones as poisonous and Samsung will lose money, so everyone will have incentives to secure their device in the future.  Furthermore, those same vulnerabilities could be used to compromise and leak law maker's phones, which would really light a fire under the issue.  
As Julian Assange has said in slightly different words, the death of privacy is not the issue.  The one way streak of  privacy is the issue since it tips the balance of power.
For the internet backbone, what really needs to happen is always encrypted IP.  I don't know why no one seems to be pushing this commercially, but nothing should be transmitted in clear text any more.  Ideally  encryption would be at the IP, http, and web page (javascript) level for instance.

I love challenges to conventional wisdom so I like reading some sort of thought out post from someone down on bitcoin.
Basically I think most people heavily educated about crypto-currencies would say this is very short term thinking.  If you look at the internet in 1995, it was full of potential that didn't pay off for a decade or more.  Many of the the things we knew would some day be possible suddenly became possible with smartphones.  Video calls from the back seat of a car to someone on the other side of the world? Almost trivial now.  People saw this potential, but it took 20 years to happen.   In 20 years crypto-currencies will re-shape world finance.  Thinking it won't catch on because it loses price (but not functionality!) over three quarters is short sighted to say the least.  People having trouble understanding or being able to use a technology has always been a temporary barrier.

No one really laughed at the iPhone. They might have made remarks to save face, but anyone with two rocks in their head could see everything copies it or dies.
I also don't think western union is laughing at bitcoin.  Right now two ATMs can take a chunk out of their business and they know it.  Last year there was one ATM in Singapore, now there are 10 or 11.  An ATM in Mumbai and a certain section is cut out. One in Manilla and another is route is taken.  There are already ATMs in Mallaca and KL.  
They have publicly mentioned bitcoin so this idea that they are laughing at it is ridiculous.

Didnt you say earlier in this thread you though western union was a bank with hundreds of billions of dollars? Do you understand bitcoin or western union?  Literally all it will take is a cryto currency ATM next to two western union stalls to make that connection between them irrelavent.  Western unions entire business model can now be done by machines hooked up to the internet.  Two people could run a city of ATMs. They will change or die, it is crystal clear.

Incompetence and criminal negligence of not disclosing details seem like they will be a given when all is said and done, but I don't agree that it is worse than being stolen, because MtGox is the result of a series of choices by one person.  
I haven't seen  anything to indicate that there is an actual fault in the protocol and not just in their custom implementations that weren't kept up to date.  I also disagree with the too big to fail sentiment, since mtgox did fail and everyone outside of their influence wouldn't have noticed.   Too big to fail is term with no real definition, a vague meaning of people losing confidence and making a run on banks, which are all fractional reserve.  This implies that everyone has all their money in banks, which is not true for bitcoin since it's whole innovation is electronic money outside the use of a bank.  
You think bitcoin price is well beyond its value, and that's fine, but it doesn't change the reality of what it can be exchanged for.

As much as I love a good counter argument, this is hugely over simplistic.  
First the generalization they _every_ business is converting _all_ bitcoins to cash is not true even now.  If more businesses are taking in btc, more suppliers to these businesses will take it as well, since there is so much benefit to immediate and secure transfer of any amount of money.  Bitcoin makes sense here even more than consumer payments, since businesses are probably not paying suppliers or other businesses with credit or debit cards.
Second, the more utility bitcoin has, the more it makes sense for people to hold some, because they know they will have opportunities to spend it.
This doesn't even take into account countries with financial systems and currencies that are already less attractive than btc (Venezuela, etc.) and would be even more so if you could order from other countries with it.

Actually the sun is red.  It looks yellow because it comes through the atmosphere which is blue. The atmosphere is blue because the spacing of ozone particles makes blue light, which is a shorter wavelength / higher frequency easier to pass through than other colors. As the wavelength goes up, the light is more likely to be scattered, and the more it is scattered, the more is absorbed.

Actually the latency is note like 100 times l1 cache.  Cache takes up a significant amount of the processor die, and there is a lot that goes into making it work, so having an asic outperform an Intel processor is incredibly cost prohibitive for many reasons. In fact this is a huge reason why it would make the algorithm more asic resistant, not less.

I suppose the theory is that people are withdrawing money from banks to pay off debts, which in turn gets deposited in the bank it came from.  Basically fractional reserve banking unwinding, causing deflation. 
It wouldn't be every bank that would be in danger in these situations, but a bank that is over-leveraged would be at risk.  A simple way to think about it is that banks can control loaning money out to people, but can't control withdraws.
You can read about the dynamics of banking during the USA great depression, which was the most severe example.

I don't know why Ubud would have more bitcoin locations than a lot of other places but....
Ubud is mostly driven by tourist money.  It is in the center of bali, about 40 minutes from the coasts on each direction. It has various spots and restaurants made for tourists.  There is a whole economy of people that cater to tourists too.  Hang around in a tourist spot and someone will offer to drive you around.  Want them to come back in 90 minutes and drive you around for 2.5 hours while they wait for you at each spot? No problem.   
People come from all over the world, so they have to exchange their money in cash into Rupiah or use their credit card internationally.  If you run out of money you accept a fee from the ATM or from using your credit card.  Bitcoin makes a lot of sense in these cases since you forgo both running out of cash and needing to exchange your money.
Not only that, but bitcoin is a substitute for cash for a single person buisness.  A lot of the people driving their own van to make money don't have the ability to take a credit card. With a smart phone, they can take bitcoins without using some other service and now aren't dealing purely with cash.  In their case this means not having to deal with change (a big pain in Rupiah) or driving/directing people to the nearest ATM, etc.

It is about decentralization of power fundamentally.  Inflation centralizes power to the people educated about money, and the people in a position to borrow the most.  It takes away power (and freedom by the same token) from anyone working a job or trying to save while staying liquid, which end up being most people, the people least educated in general and about finances specifically.  
The bigger question now is this: 
Now that you can choose your own currency, what will you choose?  Who would choose a currency that has enormous pressure to inflate to sustain itself?  
How things should or should not be is an opinion that can be debated, but ultimately people can now choose their currency (without moving to another country) and not be limited by (as much) difficulty in spending it.

I and many others I would guess are also tired of that mentality, but this person is not trying to discount the system or invite in censorship.  I think it is a valid question that needs to be confronted in any system like this.  
Basically, is it impossible for anyone to know what is store where, or given a compiled lists of links into the network, can someone censor their own node if they choose to?  People want decentralized control of information, but individuals ideally could choose the information they distribute.  Then it wouldn't be all or nothing, someone would have control and possibly be more willing to contribute.

The other methods, western union, bank transfers fees (and general bank fees) etc are way more costly, especially because of the low amounts that would probably be involved.  An ATM takes up almost no room and has minimal maintenance.  If another avenue tries to compete with a bitcoin ATM, that ATM can lower it's price, since the overhead is exceptionally small.  Why do you think we are seeing an explosion in bitcoin ATMs ? 
A $10,000 ATM making 2% needs $500,000 to pass through it to pay for itself, not including the money for upkeep and overhead.  That would be $10,000 per week to pay for itself in one year, which in any decent area is obtainable, but in an area where there are long lines to use a remittance service, the amount passing through it should be many times that.

Besides the double negatives, I'll explain why 'can't' doesn't mean shit.  Until bitcoin, people did not have a choice of what currency to use.  They had to use certain currencies for certain situations, mostly the currency of their country.  You can say 'deflationary' (money isn't dissapearing, and deflation can work of course when it absolutely must).

Banks' mainly offer one thing: a way to get your money into eletronic form, and back.  Back in the day, they offered security and interest.  Now there isn't much interest, and security is better, although keeping your cash to yourself with a giant safe in your basement is somewhat plausible too.  You can't carry around you money with you all the time but you want access to it.  You need to spend it on the internet, transfer it, turn it in to cash at the ATM.  Banks offer this, and everything else they do is either painfully complicated and slow, full of fees or both.  When crypto-currencies really hit (regular atms integrate bitcoin) and hardware wallets + cold storage are the norm, what will banks offer that makes their bullshit worthwhile?  Safety deposit boxes for one thing, insurance for another, but at a certain point they may be marginalized.

It is interesting.  There are two big things with torrents that have made them such a force.  
1. They are decentralized both in the search and the data aspect.
2. There is money to be made.
Centralized search in other apps had two weak points, a big easy target to take down, and no direct income for resources.  Torrents make money for website operators, and thus one site goes down and the whole system adjusts and adapts, just like darknet markets.  
There is obvious money in bitcoin, so the weakness are probably only legal, meaning patents and regulations.  I think the dark horse is really patents.  If you want to protect bitcoin, invent something, put it out there, and make sure it is prior art to a potential patent.

The part about occupy wall street is very interesting, you should try to find a source for that and take out the cult and occult stuff with the dollar and the flimsy story from a recent movie. Then you could have more succinct essay which you could spread to more places.

Miners are exactly who makes the choice for transaction verification, so their majority in agreement determines where the network goes and what the balance of the addresses you have the keys to really is. 
If the size limit on blocks in increased, it is the miners adopting it that counts as the network adopting it.

Very very concerning and absolutely one of if not the biggest problems to solve. Yeah, it's a huge issue.  That being said, I don't think MtGox is known to be a scam or theft yet, it could be regular incompetence mixed with problems of very early adoption. We'll see. 
I don't think it will matter in the long run though. Banks had huge issues with bank runs and would advertise how much cash they had on hand until they had FDIC insurance.  Exchanges can sign messages and prove they control certain addresses.  People need to learn (for the love of Christ already!) to keep as little money in an exchange as possible and that they need to control their private keys unless there is actual legal regulation (I'm not really for or against it, regulation will be a nuance double edged sword).  
Hardware wallets need to exist as the next wave of infrastructure after ATMs, then there will be more stability. It is still the wild west, but there is so much momentum because the problems are relatively easy to solve technically now that the tricky stuff has been figured out, and there is huge, direct financial incentives to do so.

I've never gotten the impression that Warren Buffet is good at every aspect of investing.  He has made huge amounts of money by coming out ahead on the sum of his investments of course, and it appears that this is because he knows very well how to value a company on what it has, not who it has, then he goes long.  He doesn't seem great at technology investing, which makes sense, because while many things are the same, some valuable aspects like market share, branding, distribution, etc, are hugely more fluid in tech.  Apple has had enormous success, but it has been from a string of products which were either first to market, more refined than competitors, or both.  One home-run doesn't guarantee another, so it becomes difficult to go long (unless you count eco system lock in and apps).

Despite this being misguided and outright impossible for decentralized crypto currencies,  I have to say though that a crypto currency backed by gold isn't a terrible idea.  The liberty dollar was printed, centralized, and backed by gold.  It just goes back to how much you trust the centralized authority, which would mostly be dictated by their track record over time.
Stocks are also actually interesting.  The company itself would issue crypto currency as shares of the company. Proof of stake would dictate voting and be used for claims of dividends.  I think this may actually end up being a huge part of the future of money, stocks as currencies that people actually use.  Stocks now act like currencies, except that they aren't nearly as liquid.

This made me realize something very fundamental.  Many times arguments/disagreements seem to go around in circles and become complicated and difficult.  As so often is the case in my experience, when steady progress seems difficult, the problem needs to be broken down.
In this case, there are many different proposals and many different reasons why.  It can be broken down in to many sub agreements though:
1.  Does bitcoin need to be forked?
2.  Does the fork need to happen in the next 6 months?
3.  Does the fork need to be the only one for multiple years?
4.  Does the block size limit need to be changed?
5.  Is the block size limit the only change that should go into the next fork?
6.  What proposals have been implemented and tested enough for you to feel comfortable with them?
etc. etc. 
Without structure and people being very explicit about what they think and why, it gets very difficult to decipher what really should be done as various people and groups take shots at getting their ideas of various complexity and usefulness into the mix.

This all makes sense. 
Separately from bitcoin I've known of people doing large fluid simulations that would take lots of memory. As an experiment a friend took almost all the memory out of his computer and used 4 RAID 0 SSDs (4 years ago).  The result was running a 32GB sim on 4 GB of real memory with the rest in swap.  It apparently ran at about half speed, which is very good since swapping on a spinning hard drive typically slows things down to a hundredth of their speed (the process would never finish so it's hard to tell). 
I think it would be fascinating to try this attack in some extreme way, my guess is that SSDs make it a non-issue even with whatever the current implementation is.

I'm not sure why there seems to be no connection to the combination of low interest rates + fractional reserve banking to these cycles.

How does this kind of argument have any sort of legitimacy?   20MB blocks would be 34 KB/s MAXIMUM.   Will everyone in the world be able to do that? No, but then again they can't now.  
But the bigger picture is that the number of people the current blocksize realistically supports is far smaller than number of people throughout the world that are capable of be syncing with the full blockchain.    
Bandwidth is not a limiting factor in any sort of a realistic way.  Only by creating flimsy straw man arguments with bandwidth statistics can it even seem like one for a moment.  A better way of looking at it would be the number of people and organizations that have access to certain amounts of bandwidth.  That number is far, far higher than the number of people using bitcoin.

Sure it isn't just for miners.  But really this shouldn't be a problem with the most basic database techniques.  Even if you took almost all the memory out of your computer right now and had almost the whole database on an SSD it would likely still not be even close to a bottleneck.  SSDs have such small latency that even programs that would be unusable if they went into swap end up with a very reasonable speed hit.

It almost can't help but take off if the service works.  If you think about people who are making very little money in the first place, and a city that is relatively small and has public transportation, it makes sense that they would spend the time to go where they can transfer their money the cheapest.  
Word of mouth will also be extremely strong if it works out well.  On Sundays Hong Kong is flooded with maids on their day off, getting together in groups and spending time together outside.  It is quite a sight.  Set up a small money transfer business in one of the areas where all the maids congregate, get someone who speaks Tagalog to go out and talk to them and hand out papers explaining how it works and what they can save, and it should be like moths to a flame.

I don't think any of the options on the table could result in a disruption of Bitcoin unless there are bugs (after years of testing). 
Centralization possibly, but block size is far from a cause of centralization at the moment.    A 20MB block size is only 33 kilobytes per second.   A fully saturated 20 megabit connection would be 1.5 gigabytes every 10 minutes an so would allow a block size of a gigabyte.  
At a huge block size like that (1 GB blocks), storage would be more of a problem, since it would fill up a 6 terabyte hard drive in 41 days (without compression).
This would be 1666 transactions per second, still below visa's claimed 57,000 transactions per second.  
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:38:12
It is kicking the can down the road, which really isn't a bad thing in this case.  Bitcoin works right now and the arbitrary limit seems to be the only big immediate problem.

Hotmail is a major site decades after being bought for $400 million dollars. It isn't great, but it has people locked in to it's mediocrity.  
If you have control of whatsapp you can reach 300 MILLION people, most within a couple of minutes from you sending a message.  It reaches beyond any cell carrier or phone OS.

Some things need to be cleared up here.  This is in Singapore. These guys might all be Indian but some could be Sri Lankan.  Singapore has quite a few bitcoin ATMs, some of them are two way but that wouldn't matter for these guys of course.  They absolutely do have access to internet in some form, and they certainly have access to texting, they probably all have a phone with pay as you go minutes and texts.   
This is an area ripe for remittance disruption since Singapore has the infrastructure.  According to bitcoinatmmap.com the closest ATM is in Sim Lim Square, which is very doable for someone who knows what they are doing, but it is still a pain to get to with public transportation and would be much better if there was a small business that would handle the complexity for them.  That would take care of the Singapore end easily and I can't imagine this won't  happen in a reasonable time frame.  
The tougher part is of course India.  Mumbai, Deli, Calcutta, Hyderabad, and other cities need some two way ATMs (or even better - small business that again handle the conversion).  
Basically someone can become their own western union in smaller capacities with a much lower barrier to entry, but that is likely what it will really take instead of a leap straight to using bitcoin ATMs.  
Five years down the road it seems conceivable that the construction companies that are paying these guys might actually optionally pay them in bitcoin, but we'll see how that shakes down.

I don't think it is a forgone conclusion that home users won't be able to run full nodes, but we'll see.   Internet connection speeds vary a huge amount, but DOCSIS 3.0 supports at least 300 mbs, and SSDs continue to drop in price.    While 300 mbs is the on the high side of what most people have access to, the direct numbers add up to 22.5 GB every 10 minutes.  This is again extreme, but it shows that there is a lot of headroom.  30 mbs connections aren't uncommon and the raw numbers would be 2.5 GB of course.  That would allow for over 4,000 transactions per second.

Any database of all the addresses that have a balance will grow large no matter what.  
It is not at all necessary for it to be in memory.  It could be organized by the most recently used, since in general the most recently used addresses will be the most likely to be used next.   Thus, simple caching would mean that most of the addresses being used would already be in memory.  
Addresses not in memory would require the slight latency of looking up to an SSD.  Issues like these have been solved for decades through basic database techniques.  
I find it difficult to see how this would realistically become a problem.  There would be a large cost to simply try to make miners hit their SSDs more often, and that would be alleviated by buying a couple hundred dollars of RAM.  
I don't see how this could be a viable attack.

It depends on how often and how big.  What it amounts to is a cheap way to disrupt the network.   The more mining power you have, the more frequent your bloated blocks can be.  And it does make a huge difference if it introduces periods of latency in transactions because everyone has to download a huge block to sync.
You are hand waving with vague ideas but the real numbers matter. One way or another some sort of block limiter is needed.  I'm not saying it needs to be a hard limit and I'm not saying it should be the insanely small number it is now, but it does have to be there in some capacity.  If not, anyone with with a few thousand dollars can do some damage.  If a couple of people do that, huge blocks become more frequent and more disruption occurs.  
Fundamentally the cost of an attack using bloated blocks is incredibly small compared to the cost of other attacks and becomes very obtainable.  It is a legitimate threat to the network and a hurdle that any crypto-currency will have to overcome.  I think technically there are a lot of good solutions, it is just a matter of breaking down the problem into very small chunks so progress can be made.

What would that mean though?  Somehow have a logarithmic increase in fees for blocks larger than the (mean+median)/2 of the last 5 days?

Some combination of the two?

@_date: 2015-08-30 14:15:25
That isn't at all the same since you have to verify the hashing power behind the vote.  One way or another you circle back to needing a very black and white answer weighted the a certain amount of mining power, and that choice needs to be cryptographically signed. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:14:59
And how would they agree on what is too large?  They would need a consensus on the limit of the blocksize.  Does this sound familiar?
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:07:57
So what protocol would they use to coordinate. You realize what you are describing is what is literally being discussed right now right?  
Also leaving decisions up to 'big pool talking to each other' is completely counter to decentralization.  Not only that, but if miners switch from certain pools to others, then the consensus will change. If they do it rapidly, the consensus changes rapidly.  
Whatever you are talking about would need to happen at the protocol level. Changing to the protocol is the exact problem being discussed so heavily.  
What you are suggesting isn't even close to being a viable solution.

What are some stats on this? 
What are the median and mean transaction fees for these unconfirmed transactions?  Are they pending because software isn't sorting them?
If it is a matter of someone flooding the network with low fee transactions, software should be able to handle it.  If the current software can't, that is a big optimization opportunity and not a big deal since it wouldn't be a fix to the protocol.  Super low fee or no fee transactions not getting through in a reasonable time is not a big deal since someone will of course flood the network with them.  They just have to be prioritized correctly.
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:52:58

@_date: 2015-07-02 02:24:42
There are two different issues here. What you are talking about relates to a relationship between blocksize and the distribution of transactions fees.  
If there are backlogs of valid transactions without fees or with very low fees, those transactions should be able to be handled very easily (sorted to be included last).  Someone shouldn't be able to flood the network with valid transactions with no fees and have it disrupt anything unless the server software has serious flaws.

If bitcoin works and keeps working it will likely win due to the network effect, much like .jpg, mp3, C, and many other technologies that have been surpassed but not supplanted.

@_date: 2015-07-07 13:42:33
Yes the blocksize needs to be changed, but that isn't the issue here.  Transactions need to be treated according to fee, in how they are included and how they are routed.  If these are transactions with super low fees and they are causing a problem, that is just a matter of different software, but that part doesn't need a protocol update, so it should be much easier.

This is great information since it is not just an idea, there is working, tested code to back it up.
One important distinction that needs to be made here is that this is very different from the block size issues.  
1.  This isn't at the protocol level, it is at the implementation level.
2. There are plenty of good solutions, many of which can be used together.  
Prioritizing transactions properly shouldn't be a huge technical hurdle. Not transmitting certain transactions from a node or miner level should also work if the cutoff is reasonable.  Finally, handling a large UTXO set shouldn't be all that difficult for a modern computer. I suspect there are very large optimization opportunities in the way they are being handled.

@_date: 2015-07-01 12:37:08
Although the blocksize obviously needs to be changed, the backlog of transactions shouldn't be difficult to deal with.  Decent software would just see that there are more transactions than can be included and drop the ones with the smallest fees.  
It shouldn't matter if they are rebroadcast, decent database software running on a 15 year old computer should be able to handle orders of magnitude more transactions than a block can hold.

A central authority creating a currency or access method based on private keys is great.  Competition in currencies is great.   
Right now people are locked in to the currency used by the country they live in.  Not only that, the electronic system is ridiculously inefficient and awkward.  
Any private key version of money will make it that much easier to get money where you want it and part of that means it will be much easier to buy btc.

That's cool, but the big question is how realistic is the linked map?
@_date: 2017-04-19 17:42:21
I don't think that is an accurate understanding.  If a program must branch and then decide where to look up in memory much larger than its cache, the program will be dominated by memory latency.  Argon2 was created to use this technique specifically to make asics uneconomical and therefore be asic resistant. 
Modern general purpose CPUs are good at dealing with memory latency, so the best way to mine would be what people already have, leading to decentralization.   
Besides this I'm not sure why anyone would intentionally go for GPU mining over CPU mining.  It may be much better than asics, but it still is not as decentralized as it could be.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:03:36
If a processor could be built with low latency memory, that would have been done already since the last 30 years of CPU design has been focused on that problem.  On the other hand it could be called cache, which is extremely expensive and has limited size.

The implications of this are very large.  It means that holding onto btc could be one the best ways to use moderate amounts of money in Thailand, not to mention bringing money in to Thailand in the first place.   
It also implies almost anyone in a major city could make their living off of cash and btc.  Bkk has pretty decent cell phone data.

I think the real start will be the combination of good hardware wallets and modular phones.  Most people will need something physical and simple in my opinion before they will be able to secure data this important.  Once simplicity is on the level of putting two stones next to each other and/or buying many cheap ( $5-10 ) hardware modules (with a calculator or e-ink screen, maybe even a solar strip for power).
One the flip side, acceptance by amazon, ebay, and international commerce sites like Alibaba will mean legitimacy and many people using btc without even knowing it.

If there is a way of dealing with consensus in bitcoin at a granularity other than blocks, I'm not aware of it, which isn't to say it doesn't exist.
I don't know why not to keep track of the block size limit on a block level.  Though it may be 'overkill' I think it is likely the simplest option.
I would think a spike in transaction volume would be handled very elegantly.  The limit is changing, which could easily be much larger than the current block sizes depending on what the miners converge to.  If there are transaction spikes beyond the limit miners could (and would be incentivized) to switch to increase the limit. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 14:08:14

@_date: 2015-09-01 23:49:58
Blocks are the granularity of bitcoin.  As far as I can tell, dealing with exchanging, syncing, and agreeing  on information with a different granularity would be more complicated. 
1/2 and 1/3 are chosen because they are simple, and they cancel each other out.  If a miner declares his block to be up and the next miner declares his to be down, this should result in the same limit before their blocks were mined.  
Because it is percentage based and happening on a per block level, there should be a very rapid convergence to a limit that is a result of what each miner wants weighted by their hash rate.

I meant the simplest option of what granularity to decide a block size limit using a technique like this. You asked why do it at the block level, this was my answer.
The important thing about this is that it isn't about you or I lobbying for a particular size, it is about the miners reaching a dynamic consensus on the block size limit.

People saying this probably want to start their own currency and make money off of that.  
We can see through alt-coins that people proclaim that mining power is electricity being wasted and there should be a mining algorithm that has extra benefits.  
People in general tend to be absolutely terrible at understanding what works from a system perspective with people.  Proper incentives work, while theoretical optimizations (like everyone making the same amount of money) tend to be disastrous.  Mining is part of the proper incentives to do what is important, along with the currency aspect.  While it is difficult for people to grasp at first, proper incentives are the most fundamental part of making a system work with people when they have complicated interests.

Bitcoin can be a lot of things to a lot of people. Being a purist about people not holding bitcoin is looking at one facet.  The more bitcoin is used and embedded in financial transactions, the more flexibility someone will have when they do hold it.

Gold and bitcoin are forms of money. Money doesn't earn returns by explicitly performing something of value. Warren Buffet doesn't invest/speculate on gold either.  He is not worried about specific forms of money, because that is not how he invests.
If you listen to him, he is a very specific value investor.  He invests in companies that should be able to make a very consistent return on capital over time. He isn't trying to speculate on tech startups and he isn't going to be investing in bitcoin either.  That isn't how he got rich.  He looks for return on capital.

It is a large incentive not to try to double spend, which is hugely positive. If the probability of executing a double spend * the payoff if you do is low, double spends will be minimized.   
Right now I'm guessing there aren't very many large value transactions that are zero confirmation.  Those that are, are probably in person.  So the risk of losing your money is high, the risk of ripping someone off in person is high, and the payoff if it does succeed is low.  Overall I think it is likely to be a fairly solid solution even though it isn't air tight.

Just look at it over the long - mid term.  I don't think of it as sad.  These things won't happen all at once.  First this, then other states propose it, maybe some media coverage, eventually some state or even city gets it through.  Bitcoin as a disruptive technology is happening very fast overall.  If it happens at even half the speed of mobile computing it will make a major impact on most people's lives within 7 years of an 'iPhone' moment.  Right now we are in the blackberry stage at best.  
Think about how fast smart phones have changed the fabric of communication and information.  It's been so fast people could barely speculate on it. 
I personally think it will be a combination of ATMs, local banks, and gift card type mechanics that make buying easier, while modular smart phones with hardware wallet modules, USB keychain hardware wallets, and easy push button polymer paper wallets make storage and usage easier. 
Then things like integration into more universal payment kiosks, along with debit cards loaded with cryptocurrencies will make in person payment more common.
All the while legal battles like this will be fought in parallel.   Think back 20 years if you can, how fringe gay rights and marijuana were.  Financial freedom may be the issue that rises from the fringe over the next 20 years while being disrupted over the next 10.

Decentralized decision making of where money goes, with transparency over the flow of money.  
Think of a small community/neighborhood.  What if they could make all their own laws and they kept all of their money.  Instead of arguing politics, they could spend that energy proposing what to spend collective money on (and arguing about that) and keep track of it.   That would include roads,  sanitation, police, etc. 
Right now people are forced to give money in taxes which is spent by a few people making the decisions.  That doesn't have to be the case now that latency of communication is milliseconds instead of days.

I know everyone thinks that something like this is missing the point, but controlling an established currency like the dollar the way you control bitcoin (with a private key, pseudo-anonymously) is a step forward.
It isn't as revolutionary as bitcoin, but it would break some of the seals of the current system of banking and money transactions.  Think about how many posts there are about how broken the banking system is.  This could be help be a solution to that, and would grease the wheels for easy transfer back and forth to and from bitcoin.  Not to mention that any tools that pop up to facilitate something like this would also be applicable to other crypto-currencies.
Not everyone can make a full leap forward. Most people have never used more than one currency their entire life.  An intermediate stepping stone would be a great thing.

No one has done that yet.  Few people at all see the big picture, and governments are made up of lots of smaller governments, which are made up of lots of people.  
Bitcoin is so disruptive because while breaking down some people's abilities to profit from being an entrenched middle man, other people will be using it make money.  Therefore not everyone's incentives are aligned.   A local government could greatly benefit from having people be able to pay taxes more easily.  
In Singapore, while they are a great example in many respects of what you DON'T want from a government, they made paying taxes easy.  You get a bill, you walk up to a universal kiosk in a shopping mall or office building used for paying bills, and you pay it. Done for the year.

My first thought is that the whole industry should make a push to btc, but it isn't quite realistic yet. Bitcoin needs to be easier and more bullet proof from the perspective of someone using it. Hardware wallets and paper / polymer wallets need to be easier and more refined. There also needs to be some sort of vault that takes care of some of these problems.  A commercial vault that holds cash, gold, bonds, etc and has fluid exchange in btc could help store money while shielding businesses from btc volatility, while also being separate from actually being a bank and needing all the approval that goes along with it.

That time has already passed by for crypto-currencies.  Bitcoin itself is not ideal for darknet markets, so I think the likelihood of bitcoin being relegated to only darknet markets is extremely small.  It will either be overtaken by competing currencies, continue its network effect, or be broken cryptographically.    
The likelihood that crypto-currencies don't succeed over the long term due to disinterest is near zero as far as I can see. While there is no one killer app for everyone, there are many killer apps distributed among different demographics of people.   For the first time people have a chance to create and choose their own currencies, which is historically unprecedented.

Here is the main thing to remember.  Bitcoin is the catalyst for crypto-currency creation.  For the first time anyone can create a viable decentralized currency.  At the same time, anyone can choose what they use. 
If bitcoin keeps its block size low and the transaction costs go up, it creates room for another currency to compete.
Bitcoin has the advantage from its hugely larger network effect.  Anything that isn't good for the people who use it ultimately will drive them to a competing crypto-currency.  Selfish technical decisions can destroy bitcoin in the long term, and at least erode its dominance in the short term.

Two things about this: 
1. What really matters is what the miners think, so that poll would be enlightening.
2. This seems to me to be the first big test of adaptability for bitcoin.  If it can change over time then it is much less likely that an alt coin with technical benefits will be able to challenge the network effect of bitcoin.  Really the most inflexible part will be the mining algorithm, since miners will not want to change what they are invested in.

I pay for lots of things with btc.  Maybe there are other factors for your business other than 'no consumer adoption'.  Maybe the people that are buying from you don't know you take bitcoin, don't care about it, or people that are buying with bitcoin don't want what you are selling.

It has value for the same reasons that fiat, gold, and bitcoin all have value: strong properties of ideal money.

So try not to get all worked up. Bitcoin and gold have value for a reason and that reason is that they hold many properties of ideal money and have little competition.  They are not valuable for the same reason as companies.

Fiat, gold, and crypto-currencies are all backed/valuable due to how strong their properties of ideal money are.

You have to realize that as infrastructure grows, more people and companies will hold more bitcoin, even in a country with a strong currency, just as a convenience if nothing else.  As bitcoin grows, it will eclipse the stability and usefulness of many fiat currencies. Even now it is arguably a more stable store of value than some the more poorly managed currencies in the world and exceptionally less restrictive and more liquid.  
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:08:53
My point is that there IS a relation since bitcoin's market capital is based on how much people own.  
If there is a tremendous amount invested in development and there are many skilled people working on it, it means that there is at least a lot of belief in bitcoin from people who are knowledgeable that hasn't yet translated to even those people using it to their fullest extent. 
So even the people that are the most invested in time and money in bitcoin are not even yet fully relying on what they are creating.  This signals to me quite a bit of market cap potential, even when looking myopically at just the most hardcore users.

People seem to be really quick to dismiss the idea, but using private keys that you control, even on a centralized system would be better than the credit cards we have today.

I don't think it is up for debate that it is difficult to pin down a value of what 1 btc should be worth.  If the market cap is below the money invested in infrastructure and development as well as so little that it would have to be more if everyone working on it was using it as their income that seems like some sort of soft lower bound to me.

Lots of people end up saying 'deflation is bad for an economy, inflation is good'.  If you look at short term indicators like velocity, that may be true, but ultimately it won't matter.
What does matter is that from this point on with the exception of government intervention, people will have a choice in what currency they can have their money in while still retaining liquidity. You can get worked up about the ideal system, but individuals will choose what benefits them the most, and that is not an inflationary currency.  Inflationary currency benefits the government that issues it, because they get to spend the newly created money doing the inflation.    Why would a person choose that without the threat of violence?

All of those currencies are inflationary and not liquid unless they are your native currency.  Sovereign bonds are not liquid to the extent that bitcoin is, where you can simply spend it without conversion (sort of for now while retailers are still getting on board).  
I understand inflation very well. I understand the dynamic between the federal reserve and the Treasury and that money being injected into a fraction reserve system (in the US) and that inflation subsequently being exported to RMB to preserve a lower exchange rate to keep exports from China viable.
On an individual basis, why would someone not choose a crypto currency if one stabilizes in volatility and is more widely accepted, or has a prevalence of ATMs, or both.  I keep hearing people talking about their ideal system, but it does nothing to take into account the reality of what an individual person will do with their money.  Every time I bring it up I feel like the question I'm asking isn't confronted directly.

I had to pause and think about this for a second, but I think what it really implies is that if spammers use ASICS, to use bitmessage, regular people will have to use ASICS too, and the proof of work will go up.  This is a large hindrance to widespread adoption, but could be a small price to pay to participate in an anonymous, encrypted, spam free messaging network.  If you have to buy a piece of hardware to send a message every 4 minutes it could be well worth it for someone on the network, but would make spam start to become very uneconomical. 
EDIT: From the whitepaper - if you distribute more addresses for every address you are actually looking at, then spammers will have to send that many more message for the same rate of return, effectively cutting their rate of success and multiplying their costs.

Reposting a very good comment :
Yes, there's a lot of people who are in Bitcoin because of become-a-billionaire-overnight fantasies. But you remove all that and you're left with a really fascinating system that should appeal to everyone on Slashdot. It's a mix of cryptography, freedom of speech, computing, networking, finance, economics, and even politics -- most of us here dig that stuff.
Get over the hype and take Bitcoin for what it really is: a fascinating experiment that has, so far, withstood the amazing barrage of publicity, hacking attempts, legal uncertainties, and remains valuable for reasons completely contrary to everyone that says it's worthless. It may become worthless one day, but consider the possibility that Bitcoin is disproving all your wildly oversimplified assumptions about what makes something valuable. It is completely different, and there's plenty of reasons to believe that it could succeed as much as it could fail.
Why does gold have value? Nothing is backing gold. Yet it has value, mainly because of its properties: scarcity, fungibility, density, beauty, etc. Bitcoin is really quite similar but with some different properties. Ease of transfer over the internet, fungibility, scarcity, storage efficiency, near-anonymity and built-in escrow.
I don't think it's any more ludicrous for Bitcoin to have value than it is for gold to have value. And in the end, when I want to sell WoW weapons, buy webserver space, or play a few games of poker online, why would I use gold, credit card or paypal, which all require me to remember log-in creditials, give away information and/or pay a bunch of third party fees. There's plenty of value in being able to pay people across the world, instantaneously, without sacrificing your privacy, and without paying any fees. Why is that not valuable? Seriously... quit focusing on the get-rich-quick kids, and start appreciating Bitcoin for it's unique properties and philosophy.
