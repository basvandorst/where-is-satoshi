It seems to be working. Checked error logs haven’t seen any issues. Is it not working for you?

I’ll check it out and get this fixed right away!

Noted. I’ll adjust :) thank you

I fixed it. There was an updated that added a new code for the preview template that was missing a line. You can submit listings now :)

I’ll have to check out airbitz. I’m familiar with coinmap. I’ve noticed a lot of older submissions and dead links. I was thinking of a yelp style directory with more of a profile page with more information for each business.

Yeah it definitely does. You can tell she was inspired by her

Done! I added globee as a payment option

Awesome suggestions! I will look into those thank you!

Sorry about that. There was a piece of code missing in a recent update. It has been resolved. You can now submit listings. You might need to refresh cookies, but let me know if there are any other issues. The site is fairly new so I want to make sure everything runs smoothly.

I’ll look into those websites!

Thank you. It should already be in our privacy policy. I’ll double check though. I know one was generated for GDPR-compliance recently so I will look into it
