Typically passwords chosen by a human are not random enough because humans are terrible and choosing random things so it's hard to determine how many actual bits of entropy it contains. It also depends on the length and type of characters used (letters, numbers, symbols, etc)

The miners that mined the last 10 or so blocks probably had a max block size set to around 250kb (even though the highest possible right now is 1MB) so it stops adding transactions to the block when it reaches that max. You will notice they each have a different number of transactions in the block because different transactions require a different amount of memory based on factors such as how many addresses you are sending from.
