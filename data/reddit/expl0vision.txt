There are different drivers that define the interest rates, it's not just because "banks need/want money".
Also, there are reasons why a currency is kept in an inflationary state. One of them is reducing the total value of (federal) debt.

That's very informative, thanks! One thing I don't understand at this point is why increasing the block size would make miners more powerful / give them more control? Would miners make more profit because more average fee can be earned from solving a block?

I'm fairly new to this whole Bitcoin world. Why is this good news?
Sure more trust in the economy means more money is invested, possibly also in Bitcoins. But if the trust in a fiat-based economy restores, there will be less support for a decentralised currency becoming the new global standard. And wasn't that the whole point in the first place?
Besides, if the Bitcoin trading value keeps going up, more and more people will fear that its just a bubble and only the speculation side of the story gets heard in the news. Not the ideology behind it. And again, wasn't that the whole point in the first place?

What are the most rational, as well as most "religious" arguments against increasing block size (even just to 2MB)?

There are still some major scalability issues present in the Bitcoin mechanism. Isn't there a realistic chance that this will never get solved (i.e. soft forks fail or hard forks doing more damage than good), which would result in Bitcoin becoming unusable for day-to-day transactions? So in the end, it may never become the decentralised currency alternative many are dreaming of?
