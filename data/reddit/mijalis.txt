I think that since it is not entirely *easily* to convert, we tend to add an additional, *burden* tax, that to the Bitcoin owner, makes $1 worth of Bitcoin not quite the same as $1 in fiat.

I think that the other exchanges should put out a press release stating (if) that they were aware of this issue for years and their architecture was written with standard accepted practices to prevent this type of attack. 
In other words, pointing the fault at MtGox for not implementing proper security and measures...and not letting them get away with blaming the bitcoin software or baselessly claiming that every other exchange has the same problem.

When you learn that there is a whole world beyond the border of the US, you might be able to understand how many people there are that have money, but simply have no access to any kind of modern banking infrastructure or financial instruments, such as credit cards. This is a real argument, perhaps not well explained, but very real, nonetheless.

It's 2011 and you choose to invest $1000 in 1200 worthless Magic Internet Money tokens called Bitcoin that is probably worth nothing. But you believe in it. 6 years later that idea doesn't sound so stupid anymore, does it?

[SaltLending.com]( seems to be the reputable frontrunner in this space. They are based out of Denver, CO and are legit. They just started in December of last year and have had good momentum. They are however taking it slow and approval and lending may take some time. An interesting aspect of this service is that you can pay off the interest on the loan (and it appears principal too - [link1]( - [link2]( with SALT tokens. On the official website, a single token sells for $27; however, you can find the token in some markets for $3 - $4. [ShapeShift.com]( for example, carries it. Binance, Liqui and Bittrex do too.  You can see where I am going with this... it could be quite rewarding taking out a loan and paying back with SALT tokens. On top of that, if you make all your payments on time, you get **your** crypto collateral back: which means you never really liquidated your crypto assets and therefore you shouldn't need to pay any taxes on the transaction.
Another one is [EthLend]( - [subreddit]( This one is more of a market and it is a bit UX unfriendly. It requires the [Metamask]( plugin for it to work. 
Disclaimer: I am not involved with either one of these, nor have I used them, so, I suggest you do your research and hopefully this will help you in the right direction.

Hey BTCRobinHood, it's mijalis. 
Thanks again for returning the funds... that is very noble of you... kind of a Robinhoodish thing to do.
It would have been easy to just keep quiet and watch the show. Instead, you have made aware to (hopefully) many that a passphrase can easily be cracked, IF one uses a weak passphrase, by just using dictonaries or song lyrics pages.
I am sure some users will have changed their passphrases after reading this thread. The more informed bitcoin users are, the less panic can be spread by yelling fire everytime a scare happens. The less panic, the more confidence in the system and the more confidence... well, you know.
Thank for teaching me a lesson.
@_date: 2013-07-29 11:33:28
I am learning the lesson. Some of us are a bit slower...
I have that one address, of which they have the private key, to transfer and make quick payments. All other address, I just let them "watch" the public address, while I own the private key elsewhere in a safe place. 
This allows me to see my totals, transfer, make payments and monitor transactions of all my addresses. My apparent mistake was to trust them even with the one address...
However, I am not ready to place blame yet... it might very well be me overlooking something  completely obvious.

I think much of it is because people expect a product rather than a technology. Such product, in this case Bitcoin, must be ready for global acceptance and business if it was indeed ready. They expect a direct competitor to the Credit cards and Paypal, as a consumer product. 
The reality is that, as you mention, it is not finished and it only serves as a platform for these product to be build upon. And that is what people that say these things are failing to see. 
Its Internet in 1991 all over again.

coinbase.com is the easiest and the price you buy the BTC's at is locked in. However, there is a 10 BTC per day limit for new users until 30 days have passed since your first transaction.
Or you can use Dwolla &gt; MtGox. Basically, here you let Dwolla extract your funds from your USbank and then Dwolla sends it to your Mt. Gox account. Once the funds arrive, you can then buy your bitcoins and send them anywhere.
You can find this option in Mt. Gox funding sources: select Dwolla (USA). 
Both take about 3-4 days to process, once you are verified.

I think you make a valid point. However, I am positive you wouldn't be asking this question if the trend was upward. You would see it as an opportunity to get in early, before the price rises. 
Yes, the price is volatile and much of it is based on speculation. It is a necessary part of the maturation process.

Better yet, take the private key from your blockchain wallet and store it somewhere secure (I don't know, an encrypted TrueCrypt folder would be a good candidate). Now, delete the private key from your blockchain wallet. Yes, delete it.
You end up with a "watch only" wallet that still requires the two passwords to access and view on blockchain.info, but will require the private key (in your possession), as a third step, if you ever wanted to send funds out of that wallet.

The only thing you need is the private key. The public key is just a hash of the private key and is (usually) generated by whatever wallet software/webware you use when you import your private key into it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:07:58
Get the private key and print it out, then delete the private key from the online wallet. Assuming the private key is truly deleted, a hacker would at the most just be able to get your public key, which is harmless.

If you think about it, had it not been for DPR's sloppiness, it seems that SR was pretty much untouchable. It has been running smooth and shamelessly since inception, with the authorities unable to do anything about it other than just stand there and watch it run. It just proves that the marketplace worked...great.

You may want to consider mining litecoin if you want to experience mining. It is an alternative "me too" bitcoin currency, but still in its infancy. It allows you to mine much friendlier with your CPU, rather than dedicated GPU's and it has doubled in price over the last couple of weeks.

You can also try BitInstant. Basically, you tell them (via the website) how many BTC you want. They will tell you to deposit a specific amount into a specific bank account, based on your location (BOA, Chase, etc). You walk in, deposit (no id needed) and walk away. Within an hour you should have your bitcoins in your wallet. 
I have done it many times and works fine.

Here is an address with a secure passphrase: 
Now, I am baffled that one does not need to be "inside" or logged-in to blockchain.info to use the passphrase. I thought the passphrase + your log in credentials were need to decrypt the private key in order to send funds from your address.
