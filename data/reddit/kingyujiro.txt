One of the only things Google could learn from apple is to force retailers to sell vanilla android. They should still allow modders like xda to create t heir own roms but force people selling handsets to sell it with vanilla android. At the very least the should force every retailer to give the customer a choice between touchwiz and vanilla android. 
You would think Samsung would just stick with vanilla android instead of wasting man hour fucking everything up with touchwiz.

Your not listening. It is cheaper to get a good gaming desktop and a good laptop than a 15lb alienware laptop that half asses every aspect of gaming and being a laptop.

But what he said was not really true. The biggest factor in a good picture is the photographer. A good photographer can take a good picture with any camera. You just have to know a little about what your doing. 
Just to clerify their is no doubt that a full frame DSLR is going to out class an iphone. If you give the DSLR to a 4yr old and the phone to an actual photographer your likely going to get better pictures from the phone though.

They are not going to do any of that. They will prosecute businesses that accept bitcoin. They may even try to target individuals with large amounts of bitcoin. 
Either of these things happening is going to stop widespread adoption like many want.

dismal battery life and exceedingly overweight.  Unless you get that tiny underpowered overpriced POS they used to sell.

When the police go to a news paper and interview for an article about an "alleged" criminal it always portrays that person as something much worse than they maybe. 
Wether it is twitter or your local newspaper this happens all the time.

Never, either way.

Why would you want to do that? We are all talking about high end games. If your on vacation or traveling and forced to use a laptop  their are tons of games that will play on a laptop, that is good at being a laptop. Their is no need to buy something that is horrible at both things it wants to be.

The senator told the guy he was wrong... Then the guy is like see see he agrees 
I rest my case. This guy is obviously an idiot. He is so feeble minded he can't even tell that the senator disagrees with him...

What do you do on your chrome book? What is it capable of? Is it just a browsing device? A Google docs editor? Why would some one want a chrome book over say a 1k$ windows laptop. Besides the price difference. 
What percentage of a normal windows laptop functionality do you get with a chrome book?

So you don't even need a laptop you just need a portable PC those are pretty easy to make.

The iphones sensor is much smaller than a thumbnail. I supposed you could have pretty small hands though. Micro four thirds is probably closer to thumbnail size at 21.6mmX17.3mm. The iphone 5 on the other hand has a sensor size of 5.6mmX4.5mm. 
The iphone is capable of taking a decent shot if you care to take one and are not a moron. The phone has a flash and an aperture of 2.2. While the iphone pictures are going to be far from the quality of a DSLR they do not have to be horrible. 
I guess it does not take intimate knowledge of the hardware your using to be able to be a "professional". Then again the word professional does not really hold the same meaning anymore.

Many people have no idea how to get them. With SR any computer literate person knew exactly how to have them delivered to their door. So no decriminalization does not compare with SR. SR made it much easier to acquire them.
I personally couldn't care less about SR but the idea that this guy is being wrongfully imprisoned because " he didn't hurt any one" is ridiculous. He was a drug dealer. He took commissions from the sale of illegal substances.

What about the people that only got addicted to drugs because they were so easy to get on SR?
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:47:40
If I was not familiar with it that would just prove my point more. If some one was not familiar with the drug world yet knew about SR and what they could buy that proves that SR may be the only place some people knew to buy.

When they decriminalized it did they set up a relatively easy way for people to have the drugs mailed to their homes?
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:48:26
So it has nothing to do with the topic at hand. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:51:23
Most people do not know where to buy drugs and they are to afraid to ask. SR was likely the only place many knew about.

Whether or not you want to believe it ease of access plays a large role in illegal substance addiction. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:43:32
Yet silk road may have been the only access many had to these things.
