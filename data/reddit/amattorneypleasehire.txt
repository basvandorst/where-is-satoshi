What makes you say that?

It’s because people don’t understand what blockchain technology is and they all assume bitcoin IS blockchain technology with their ignorance of the technology.

Are you suggesting this is a “hit piece” on Bitcoin?
I hope I’m not coming off as brash - I’m legit asking. I like the discussion around this.

Thank you - that’s a good read. Although it doesn’t alleviate my concern that bitcoin can be influenced by someone/one corporation in the future, it does help with this whole Bloomberg thing.

I didn’t see this last year, else yes - it would have bothered me then.

Thanks; I didn't know ETH was switching to PoS. I appreciate the advice, I'll take it to heart

God damn. I'm seriously considering taking a 50,000 loan out, paying off all credit cards, and dumping the rest into Bitcoin. I'm tired of watching this without being able to jump into it

Yea but I can; went to the bank today. Looked at a 25 grand loan, will use part of it to pay off all credit cards and rest in Bitcoin. 5 years to pay off loan, $500 a month. Even if Bitcoin fails somehow and I lose all money in it, I can still afford to pay off the loan within 5 years. Seems like it's a decent risk

Wait, wow. I feel like an idiot. I've always thought I completely missed the BC train because of its price, but I never realized I can buy parts of 1 coin. I'm definitely doing that. 
I've been planning on buying maybe 2-3 full ETH. I could take that hit if it loses all value. My problem is I don't feel intelligent enough to turn those 2-3 into a profit to buy even more ETH; like, I wouldn't know what to do if they rose in value to buy more.
