Deflationary economies are absolutely miserable for a host of reasons.

It's interesting in that it's a complete non-sequitur. The market may behave in a somewhat explainable fashion in that it's a monolithic entity whose overarching profit motive and sheer size serves to smooth out all the random bad human nature (of course, even in regulating an economy, we've seen plenty of examples that counteract the notion of a self-regulating free market).
The idea that suddenly everyone is going to abandon violence as a tool because of some overarching profit motive is supported by nothing and counteracted by the whole of human history. Is Spats suggesting that we only have criminals in today's society because our markets are regulated? That's asinine.
The only way Spats's idea makes sense is if you are a firm believer in the Galtian uber-mensch without whom all society cannot stand, and with whom society bursts into beautiful, lucrative bloom. Somehow this John Galt's singular inventions will spur Warlord A's economy to such flourishing heights that they could *never* be invaded and force could *never* be used against them. And of course, an "anarcho-utopia" would be impervious to internal corruption, revolution, and the vagaries of the outside world. They would not use their newfound power to oppress others. 
This is a fairy-tale. 
Thought experiment: I work for a utility. A utility takes thousands of well-trained people to run in order to keep the lights on. What is the incentive to run the power in an anarcho-utopia? Who pays the people that keep the lights on? Reconnecting a disconnected service is incredibly simple, and you can't police millions of meters at once. Honestly, a power company trying to disconnect power would often be met by force.
