More like him asking if there was an actual internet police lol. But nice try 
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:05:43
I’d be disappointed for sure. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:07:58
Looks trash. Matches the cash I guess?

@_date: 2018-05-05 13:27:16
I love that these story’s are accepted here 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:56:38
If the risk lies in solely the wallet Id. Good luck telling me it’s not decentralized when 99% is basically held by legit 4 or 5 heads? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:36:45
Actually 100% nothing to do with grammar. Also indicated everything I need to know. You defended grammar over theory lol 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:33:22
This is EXACTLY why crypto will never be a legit thing lol. People are this .... gullible 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:35:52
How many address are in BTC right now tho? Lol 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:43:22
Again, I wouldn’t be here reading if I didn’t understand. A word salad is exactly that. You sound like majority of the crypto news shows lol. It’s all good man. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:12:09
Regardless how you draw it up. If that high of a percentage is in our single avenue it’s not decentralized because that majority controls the market. Thus when big dogs dumb they she dips. Lol 
I love when people try this. 
They can trade/sell your BTC into nothing because they hold it ALL lol 
Meaning yours would be worth shit and theirs worth at least something. Then when the knuckle heads sell boom. 
Very simple. 
Market manipulation is illegal on Wall Street on face value.

Literally went through his recent post. All are from one of two outlets. They know everything. Just like you. I’m sure of it. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:31:43
Cute 
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:57:29
Exactly this lmaooooo
But realistically. I don’t expect someone carrying usbs with their wallets on them to be that bright. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:26:24
It’s not a crystal ball, it’s technical analysis, we are currently in a rally, it will go down and test 9600 but considering news shorts long volumes etc all indicates
If we do go under 9600. Next major support is 9300 and 9100 only a true break on 8900 will set off a bear market again and return down to 3500.
This is my favorite word salad of he day so far
Have fun

If Greece effected the price of bitcoin you have a bigger problem on your hand. Kinda like how Hillary Clinton and the democrats all but had the election. Echo chambers of false info ARE NOT GREAT FOR CRYPTO OR ANY ONE THING. Makes things seem bigger than they actually are.

Thanks linzers! Perfect translation
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:01:13
Still has upvotes tho lol this community. Please downvote this into oblivion 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:44:45
But in BTC the holder is the owner regardless. So all of that is word salad bud. Would you trust someone with your BTC? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:28:23
Thank you lol! I love how delusional people get. The only thing not effected by hacks, emps, etc is something physically tangible not over a network.  
Which is not credit, btc, or any of those listed. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:07:44
Scaling to be the leader is completely different my friend but I do see what you are saying. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:26:58
Scalability , what you know as bitcoin and how it’s curated is too small to support global achievements lol. If bitcoin brand wants to go global it will change drastically for sure b
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:58:32
Biggest market that hasn’t been broken in quite sometime and you wanna say getting that currency isn’t what this is about? Lol dense. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:42:18
Love when bitcoin is listed with a $ sign lol 
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:24:51
It’s like the peeps in BTC 
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:13:33
Just because you have a phone doesn’t mean anything. You and I might share 4 of the same apps but we have over 40 on our device. Doesn’t mean anything.
