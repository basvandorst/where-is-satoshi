BTC_B is not real btc. It is the currency that bter issued after they got hacked. 
Sure they did promise to pay users back but the money needs to come from somewhere. And I'd say that bter is now have very low volume post hack. They took a massive reputation hit and there are actually many viable altcoin exchange alternatives, they weren't exactly special. So they're basically making very little volume now and what I'm trying to say is to not expect them to be able to pay you back.

So lets clarify a bit more.
First of all you need to put bitcoins into the payment channel first. And the transactions you give him splits those bitcoins between the both of you. So at first you give him a transaction giving him 1 BTC and you 99 BTC. And then when it stops the published transaction might be giving 37 btc to him and 63 btc to you. And there's no reason for him to publish the transaction giving 5 btc to him and 95 btc to you because then he wouldn't be able to publish the transaction where he gets 37 btc.

It depends on inputs and outputs. So if you have a lot of dust from different inputs addresses that will make it bigger. And if you're sending to more people that'll make it bigger.
A quick search got these numbers from bitcointalk a year ago. They may be wrong.
180 bytes per input + 34 bytes per output + 10 bytes.
Inputs take up more room because you need to verify you control them.

You should use a client that has coin control to choose your inputs.
And then you can estimate your transaction size. 180 Bytes per input, 34 Bytes per output, + 10 Bytes.
Also note some clients probably does this for you.

This sort of estimates fee. If you're doing a simple transaction its only 200 Bytes. So a 2000 satoshi fee is enough a lot of the time. Or your could do 5000 satoshis.

There's an interesting thing with economic majority. People could sell coins on the 50 btc chain for 25 btc chain coins. And that could incentivize miners to mine the 25 btc chain. Or 50 btc chain coins could be deemed worthless and miners would be losing money by mining the chain.

1. The block subsidy keeps halving. Eventually it'll reach zero, before then it'll be insignificant. Transaction fees could possibly incentivize miners to secure the network without the block subsidy.
2. There's a tradeoff with decentralized systems. Currently the blockchain is 52 GB. Nodes get the whole thing through p2p (peer to peer). One thing to note is that a miner can mine in a pool and it's just the pool that needs to have the full blockchain.

What's interesting is that an exchange could implement this before the hard fork even happens.

Another thing about softforks is that they happen when a majority (usually supermajority) of the mining power agrees with the soft fork. Afterwards if an old minor tries to mine an invalid block with the new rules then the miners with the new client will just ignore the block and keep mining.
Because a super majority of the mining power is on the new chain you're able to maintain the new chain and enforce the new rules. To old clients the blockchain will look completely valid and it's unknown to them that they also all follow some new rules.
I hope that didn't complicate things too much.

I think it's possible for both forks to continue running. I think the hash power on each fork will be determined economically. If it's a 1:1 ratio it'll be a 1:1 hashrate. I strongly doubt the exchange ratio will be 1:1 . Anyways as you can see with altcoins, hashrate is based on value.

Under the contract terms, OKCoin was responsible for the advertising revenue generated by the site. Because the site was already generating 2,500 hits per day before OKCoin’s involvement, the parties agreed that should OKCoin generate less than $40,000 in any given month, they would pay Roger $10,000. OKCoin was otherwise obligated to share a variable percentage of the advertising revenue with Roger. Additionally, OKCoin had preferential rights to advertise for itself on the site.
Anyways they stopped paying. Roger is a bit pissed off about that. And now he's looking to lease the site to someone else.
@_date: 2015-08-24 01:00:23
Yeah I was speculating about that too.
1 BTC gives you 1 btc-xt and 1 btc-core, And then you could just trade those. And then they won't be deliverable till later. Or you could meld back btc-xt and btc-core to get back a btc.
I think economic consensus is really important. With 66% split for xt, core could still survive. if it was 99% xt then core would die.
I wonder if their are thoughts to hardfork the mining protocol.
Currently Bitcoins protocol sucks for alternate forks surviving.
Also some people don't think forkcoins can be altcoins just because they shared the same chain. You could fork the diff calc, and some other stuff and you'd be able to have a fork with minority power. And the value on it would be miniscule. I think that would clearly be an alt.

For your 'investment' to appreciate, you're dependant on other people purchasing Bitcoin at a higher price.

This is weird. I thought you were allowed to make transfers without using escrow.
But for transactions requiring electronic payments I could understand why escrow is needed.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:48:55
One way to solve this would be for an exchange to adopt the trading of Bitcoin XT and 'OG' right now.
Basically you'd need to agree to a 4 month hold since you can't withdraw XT or OG right now. 1 BTC converts to 1 XT and 1 OG, and you can combine 1 OG and 1 XT for a BTC.
And as mentioned, the exchange will need to be careful to only give you XT or OG. This can be quite safely done though.
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:45:53
One problem is that users don't really differentiate writers. It sucks that writers don't get paid a lot.
I think there's some similarities between a cashier at McDonalds and a writer working at CoinTelegraph.
CoinTelegraph's value comes from it's name and brand value. I can't quantize it. It's perceived quality on and it's also traffic from twitter. It's also the subscriberbase it gained from people going on the site.
And CoinTelegraph sells that to advertisers. Bitcoin is about money and advertising is lucrative.
While there are a lot of people trying to get a spot in the Bitcoin blog/news site, it's still possible to make your own site. If you really think your writing will be good enough. You'll also need twitter bots for promotion. And you'll need to build a subscriber base, get goodwill for your name. And you'll need to sell yourself to advertisers.
Also what's the big deal about the owners? How on earth is it the biggest mystery?

@_date: 2015-08-15 21:58:07
On the other hand, I think price will be key. The exchange ratio between the price will dictate the hash rate differences. Very similar as with altcoins.
Even if a miner politically supports one fork, they may choose to mine the other chain because of an economic incentive.
Numerous altcoins have survived with less than 25% of the bitcoin hashrate.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:00:58

On top of the block reward. Yeah it would possibly need to a bit higher.

You're right, I'm quite mistaken in that sense then. There would be absolutely no economic incentive to run Bitcoin OG, until there's a difficulty change.

When you invest capital in a business you own a stake in it. The business offers a service that is worth money to people. This might be running a store, manufacturing a product, or something else. So a grocery store makes money by selling food.
Your investment in the grocery store results in appreciation in price because the grocery store is profitable and makes money. They make money by offering a valuable service. Maybe they let consumers access cheaper food, or offer higher convenience (which can be worth more than price).
Bitcoins are very speculative assets. It's not recommended to put all your money in them.

I think he makes an excellent point. While there are main scrypt coins like Litecoin and Dogecoin, people mine on alternate chains because of value. Depending on the ratio the markets decides, miners could still mine the old chain. 
Also there are many altcoins that run with 25% of Litecoins hashrate.

Cool, also NAND is used in flashdrives.
Actually it's probably because NAND has been getting more efficient. You can see that with SD chip capacity growth.
And after a threshold it became possible to build SSDs. And after that they grew more efficient and cheaper.

ah correct, you were actually looking for a general site.

Yes after a certain ratio of winning chain to losing chain, the losing chain will have a very difficult time surviving because of the high difficulty.
While unlikely, there are some situations where the chains will coexist for a period.
One possibility is that Miners lie about supporting XT
Here are some cases allowing the losing chain to continue as an altcoin.
If the price is really different, there won't be an economic incentive to mine the losing chain.
1) You'll need miners who'll politically support the losing chain.
2) Or big transaction fees on the losing chain will give an economic incentive to mine it.
After it reaches 2016 blocks, the losing chain could survive as an alt. This is sort of the reason why altcoins use quicker retargets.

He's correct in some ways. Cavirtex did shut down. But afterwards another exchange Coinsetter bought out Cavirtex.
And Coinsetter isn't a nobody.
And it's not really faking market depth by using bots. Realistically everyone should know the real major price discovery isn't being done from the small exchanges. They just source liquidity from bigger exchanges.

It'll return -1 if there is no fee or priority high enough to be reliably (85%) included in the next block.
Note that it's not just about fee but priority also plays a role. If you have high priority transactions you should be able to get in. If there are a lot of high priority transactions you might not be able to get in even with a higher fee. (big transactions, old coins).
Also not that this backtests and checks for probability. Just because you have a higher transaction fee doesn't always mean you'll be accepted in the next block.

I'm Roger Ver, long time Bitcoin advocate and investor.
Today I'm at the Mtgox world headquarters in Tokyo Japan.
I had a nice chat with MTGOX CEO, Mark Karpeles, about their current situation.
He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers.
I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at MTGOX are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at MTGOX.
The traditional banking partners that MTGOX needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.
The dozens of people that make up the MTGOX team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with MTGOX easier for all their customers around the world.  For now,  I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

@_date: 2015-07-04 20:28:30
and that wouldn't exactly be based on a calculation of volatility using standard deviation.
They seem to be suggesting for people to trade a historical VOL product.
Either it's pegged which will mean they lose a ton of money. (You can't possibly hedge a historical volatility product)
Or the let the price float and it'll never settle which is a completely useless derivative product.
EDIT: you can't even trade an implied volatility asset.
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:17:23
This is interesting.
You say you're calculating based on standard deviation. That makes sense. Do you have more details about this? 
btcvol.info seems to use 1 day snaps, bitmex uses 5 min snaps on bitfinex. I think it matters what type of snaps you use to test for volatility. If the price wicked for 4 hours it wouldn't be detected on btcvol.info If it wicked for 2 minutes it probably wouldn't be detected on bitmex.
Also timeframe is useful, what time frame are you basing it on? Btcvol.info index is based on 30 day. Bitmex has contracts that allow for trading 24 hour and 7 day volatility.
Secondly your asset doesn't make sense.
You can't have an asset that is pegged to volatility. You have to trade with implied volatility, what the market thinks the volatility will be.
And then you can't even do that with your asset because if it never settles then you have no guarantee that it even trades at the volatility level. You can't trade a derivative contract that never settles.
EDIT: The only way you could do it is based on an implied VOL calculation but that is based on an options market. You can't calculate implied VOL using standard deviation, that's something the market decides.

Yeah it's very interesting scenario if there's two viable chains. I think exchanges will be setup to trade them. And I doubt that it'll be a 1:1. But it'll be really interesting what the market decides.
One thing though is that if one side gets too much support it'll be an economic victory. The loser will have a very difficult time reaching the retarget.

I think the losing fork could survive. We've seen coins with smaller market caps. And people could say this altcoin had a fair distribution.

Well that's not really a dedicated revenue stream. That money is supposed to be saved for their own retirement otherwise it's basically a ponzi.
And then they have massive exposure in the government. And they're revenue stream is through taxes. So they'll need to tax future generations also to pay that debt.

It'd resolve a lot faster if they just fixed their mining client.
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:35:49
Yeah interesting because this is a soft fork. Really if a super majority of the hash power actually behaved we wouldn't have had this problem.
So because it's a soft fork older clients should still be on the right chain especially with 30 confirms. If a Version 2 chain was able to stay ahead for 30 blocks, that'd be quite a problem.

So right now you're suggesting using their very valuable Euro cash that they were able to withdraw, and using them to buy 'luxury goods' . That sounds ridiculous. Your cash is worth a lot more, you shouldn't be scrambling for assets that are worthless.
If the economy really crashed, do you think people will be looking for luxury goods? Those things are worthless in a depression. Especially in a liquidity crunch. People won't be willing to spend liquid currency for stores of value, and a crappy store of value at that.

I think there's going to be slippage no matter what canadian exchange you go to. The exchange isn't for day trading, you're just trying to get your fiat into the system.

No your link is just BTC/USD on okcoin.com
And futures usually gaps with spot because futures allows up to 20x leverage but there is forced liquidations, the exchange needs to liquidate because there might actually be a big move. Also people might not be willing to short for a whole week, or there's not enough liquidity.
What's amazing is that US exchanges never went over $300 but the index was at $340+.
And there was a lot of volatility in futures.  $270 to $350 to $300 to $285.
Massive profit on 20x. And a ton of people getting rekt.

The major computing power is looking up the address to see if it has a balance. You can do it for free and get blockchain.info to do it for you (or other site) but that's limited and you'll get ip blocked.

it would be a problem even if they were ahead by less than 7 blocks. There's the problem of how long they held the lead for.
But it's only a problem for older clients. New clients will say the longer one is invalid.

Well F2Pool will mine the Version 3 chain once it catches up but they'll mine the Version 2 chain as long as it's longer. They're just wasting money mining Version 2 right now. And even after Version 3 catches up, if F2Pool mines Version 2 blocks in the future it'll get orphaned again. They'll just waste more money. So it's in their interest to eventually switch to Version 2.
But if they don't switch, the rest of the network needs to catch up for 3 blocks. Otherwise we'll have this split mining problem. The time for this to happen depends on the mining power behind the Version 3 chain and the Version 2 chain, and also luck.
Anyways Version 3 chain caught up.

That is a very good question because people like to compare two different numbers. Some people, "Woah so much fees in the backlog" and some people "wow the mempool is 38 MB"
So just because there's a big value in the mempool doesn't mean that miners can fit it into blocks and get a ton of fees. So if you go on tradeblock there's a nice 7 day graph for Fee/size. Currently it's around 14 satoshis per Byte.
Another interesting metric would be how much of a fee you need to be included within 30 minutes.

If there's an invalid transaction it's not a valid block, even if it's the longest chain. If they decide to do a coinbase transaction of 50 btc, that could be the longest chain, but the nodes won't recognize it.

The mempool is paying on average 14 satoshis per Byte.
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:36:35
One question is how big the transaction you made was. 0.001 would be the minimum for a 20 kB transaction. (a basic transaction is 225 Bytes).
Also I think you should check other sites if they see the transaction. It`s weird that it supposedly didn`t propagate.
Your transaction will definitely not confirm until Alice`s transaction confirms because otherwise you`d be creating bitcoins. But if you have a big enough fee, you`d see both of your transaction included in the same block.
But first those transactions need to get propagated to nodes.

Today I'm at the Mtgox world headquarters in Tokyo Japan.
I had a nice chat with MTGOX CEO, Mark Karpeles, about their current situation.
He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers.
I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at MTGOX are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at MTGOX.
The traditional banking partners that MTGOX needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.
The dozens of people that make up the MTGOX team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with MTGOX easier for all their customers around the world.  For now,  I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

From WSJ article. 


Cumberland mining was a big mystery last time. There was just one tweet with the btc address. And they had a follow from pgp which is the bfx exchange owner.
Coindesk had a surprisingly comprehensive article. And they explored the pgp key trail.
The final link was this article from the wsj.
And the reddit thread confirms that it's the first time we learned about it.

That was the first time we heard of it.
And coindesk offered a surprisingly comprehensive analysis. They did analysis of the pgp keys they found.
And then afterwords there was some news article that linked Cumberland mining with DRW holdings. I know that the original source was not zero hedge. And it wasn't the main point of the article, but I found the connection and it was really interesting.

I don't think there are any limits. USDT requires verification. If you empty your whole account the withdrawal might take a bit of time.
One warning though about bfx, you might get a bit less than 1 BCC per BTC. It really depends on the distribution coefficient.
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:38:38
Yeah I agree that because of the zero fee that you can't compare volume.
I think a benefit of zero fee trading is that there's no barrier for price discovery. And I think that's really important. Regardless of volume, I think a lot more price discovery is happening on zero fee exchanges.

@_date: 2017-06-13 20:08:48
Yes I understand why multiple withdrawals cost more in transaction fees.
I was talking about deposit fee vs withdrawal fee. When LBC is bundling a large number of deposits or withdrawals, each deposit input is going to cost quite a bit more than withdrawal outputs in terms of fees.
But one small thing is that bundling deposits can be done with a lower sat/Byte.

Warning to people loaning BTC on Polo.
1. Counterparty Risk - You have to trust Polo.
2. Bitcoin Fork - You might not be getting coins from both forks.
3. You're lending BTC to fund longing on altcoins. This is not risk-free. You could end up with a loss if the alt tanks very quickly and the forced liquidation isn't enough to fulfill their btc liabilities.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:01:39
Yeah great point is that deposits actually do incur costs on the system and it does make sense how it could be fair to charge depositors too.
Second reason is a bit flawed. LBC deposits can also be batched too. They don't need to sweep them right away.
The actual reasoning is something that is inherent with how transactions are created. Haven't really thought of it like this until now. Transactions cost 180 bytes per input but only 34 bytes per output.
