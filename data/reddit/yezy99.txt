Any pro trader would have told him take money off the table. That's the problem most option traders make holding too long or selling too soon. If your not good at trading options best to follow a paid option service that way at least they will point you in the direction of where the big money is going and you'll likely see a lot more winners. Before AMD went down there was very heavy PUT buying it was a sign to sell. Pete on CNBC is really good with his unusual options alerts too I'd see he's right about 70-75% of the time.
For instant the service I follow an alert was given for SQ 39.5 calls that expire today. It had been heading down most of the day yesterday, then today boom blew right past 39.5 at open. The big traders have more resources than you so u benefit by mirroring their trades..

Exactly. But that being said. If you ever want to see big money in life starting from little (10k) there are only few legal resources that can get you there very quickly. RE or Stock Options, but you can also be burned on both If you make the wrong move.

I don't know why he lost money. I made money on the SQ trade and I'm already out of it. I didn't brag about anything just gave some tips. All that grade A retardation teenager talk is for birds man..name calling like a little girl and offering nothing. Get off your moms couch kid.

Yea and even If you did get back into the account it's likely the BTC is not even there been hacked or stolen by admin or some shit pretty sure they probably have somewhere in their fine print that says something along the lines of forfeiting BTC if account is left unattended for a certain amount of time..

Decent might have to roll those if they don't work out though. The long(as in May/June) BAC 31 calls are pretty cheap remember you want to be a part of the buyback and higher interest rates no telling where BAC wil go upper 30's possibly

Banks have had a few runs since then and are still a few bucks higher so depends but banks still have a lot of room too run
