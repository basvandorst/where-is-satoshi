You keep saying you would have gotten hit harder.  24 months doesn't seem like a lot.  Did you just not have that much in coins to just give up your wallets?  How much harder could they have hit you?  Just seems weird to me.

I'm new to this.   If it forks and I get a new coin, how will I be notified of this?   Will it just be in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:07:56
