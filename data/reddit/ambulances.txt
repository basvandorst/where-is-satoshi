I didn’t take it literally... everyone else did and I was pointing it out to you since you missed the memo. No need to be hostile in every comment with the name calling.

You only need to pay taxes once you sell and make a profit. It’s called capital gains.

Good luck! Crypto isn’t a place where you can make money easily. To me it’s more of a cool technology and a nice community (sometimes).

There might always be someone selling/trading bitcoin though since it is a currency. The 21 million bitcoin cap should only make the price go up!

I had the exact same thought about 8 months ago. I learned my lesson now I hodl.

Don’t be mad that you are missing the dips :”)
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:16:41
There was one on poloinex in feburary. Can’t find it anymore :( 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:36:29
Don’t buy in and expect a great return until some months later. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:08:43
Yep just buy right now. You will never find the dip. It could go up 5k today and you will be kicking yourself because the dip is now! Or it could go down 5k in a month but you never know...

Send a ticket. 
The asking price is different on every exchange. No way it could be the same since you have a different group of people on the exchanges saying how much they think XRP is worth.

You will also destroy your computer : )

Search how to make a paper wallet on youtube. It’s a LOT safer.
