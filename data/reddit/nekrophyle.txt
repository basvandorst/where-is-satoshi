Mass adoption will see some gains, but I don't think it will be as much as some people are hoping. There is money to be made, but shy of global economic collapse, I don't think we will ever see that million dollar Bitcoin mark on today's terms. My predicted cap for the foreseeable path of crypto is a $30k coin max.
Honestly, I think it would be stranger if mcaffee made rational decisions at this point. I'm not saying he is 100% eating dick... But homie is fucking weird.

It really is. Bitcoin was establishing a place in the market. That requires rapid growth to match it's supposed competitors. There is no follow up insane expansion in basically any fiscal future because there is not reason to. Ten times maybe, but another 1000x growth is absurd and delusional.

Most people who I've seen haterage at the MK5 have never say in a MK4 or seen a 2jz outside of the F&amp;F movies. This new Zupr4 is a beast no matter where it is built

What if I told you vaccinated people care about people not getting vaccinated because they possess basic human empathy, and feel people who can't get vaccinated (like me) shouldnt suffer the consequences of idiots who misunderstand basic scientific concepts deciding that dunning Krueger doesn't exist...

I kinda get where you are coming from, and I understand the whole "more bees with honey" concept... But homie's world view is literally endangering my life. And if he is incapable of understanding decades of scientific backing to a degree that stops him from doing so, there is little I can say to double his braincells to a count of "8". If he is too dumb to be taught, as anyone who doesn't understand the basic principles of a vaccinated population is, then at least I can have the satisfaction of being a dick to him before I die from some illness caught after measles wipes out my immune system even further. 
Fuck him, the horse he rode in on, and all the pseudoscientific bullshit he feels like spouting.

Again, I kinda get where you are coming from, outside of the part where you are blanket applying a principle where it doesn't really fit.
If government/corporations told us which gasoline was not good for us to drink, and some people didn't follow that, that isn't some natural process to keep us diverse and healthy. Some people are just fucking stupid, and get to drink gasoline and die. Except in this case it is more acceptable because someone having the religious/political beliefs that drinking gasoline is the way to go isnt hurting anyone but themselves on their ignorance, anti-vaxxers are. If any when their variety show opinion can be backed with absolutely anything with weight or merit, I am all ears. But currently it isnt in the case of vaccines.
Now, if the religion/politics had a soundly tested and well backed reasoning behind what they were arguing, then yeah, sure, debate can be healthy. But until you give me some really solid reasons aside from "variety is the spice of life" then you really don't have a point, and not understanding that doesn't give you a moral high ground just because you are feigning politeness about it
As for me moving to accommodate idiots, if my neighbors decided to walk into the street with an AR-15 and see how many 30 round mags he could empty per 360° spin, we as a society could agree that was stupid, and enact policy to stop it. Because it serves no point, and harms others. Doing that same thing on a biological level isn't a reason for me to flee to the hills, it is a reason for society to say "fuck this guy is dumb. No." Which luckily seems to be the current path.

I do. 
I don't know where you thought this would become some sort of debate on those subjects. Couldn't agree with any of them more, though I would request a bit of QC and oversight on open source vaccine production, but I would kinda guess you left that unsaid but intended.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:37:26
So you are just out here spitting altruistic truth bombs? Trying to save us from evil big pharma?
I'll bite. I like to learn. Teach me why it is beneficial to avoid vaccination. Even just to yourself. Use sources, I really wanna learn, but I'm not one to take your word for it, sadly. I'll set aside my bias and read anything you provide fully and openly.
Not even being a dick. I'm 100% listening.

So not entirely dissimilar from blind Bitcoin followers. Just without the "making people die" part.

When I was in college I turned down like $20 in Bitcoin in early 2009 (maybe early 2010) for an item in WoW because I didn't need fake internet points... I don't remember for sure but if it recall Bitcoin was like less than a penny or some shit. It hurts.

There are lies, damn lies, and then there are statistics.

Wow. What a beautifully crafted false equivalancy!
Placebo17: "I don't give a shit about anyone but myself, so I must assume no one else cares even enough to get a repeatedly proven to be safe vaccine!"
Must be a sad, lonely life you live, friend. If you ever need anyone to talk to, let me know. It can get better.
