There's other coins that do that better than bitcoin, almost all of them do it cheaper and as fast or faster at this point. I agree with you, I just don't think the best option to do that is bitcoin. Also gold is really easy to transfer most gold is held as a cirtificate, few people actually keep significant amounts of bullion.

This is hilarious because KFC no longer uses the 12 spices or however many. They're a cheap knockoff of what KFC originally was, using only salt pepper flower and msg for the breadding. Long live biting legacy.

Why would anyone invest if other crypto can be a long term store of value AND move money? Also what does bitcoin offer as a store as opposed to property or gold?

I've noticed a huge uptick in negative comments about all cryptos. Just look at the coinbase thread. So many comments saying they're unregulated when that's simply not true. Having said that bitcoin is dead. LN can prolong it for a little but it no longer does anything other cryptos can't do better except have your grandma say "I've heard of that"

I think you forgot and  . It's always been gifs and meme when the price was going up. This subs turned to shit, but for other reasons I'm not gonna get into since I'd rather not have this comment removed.

No, moving them between wallets is not a taxable event any more than moving your lambo will be between your mansions, or your 401k to a rollover ira. On that note does anyone have tax advice for selling a large number while minimizing taxes?
