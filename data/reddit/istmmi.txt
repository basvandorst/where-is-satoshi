Preparing an official warning to KnC for next week. If they do not obey the refund request, they will get sued in an instant.
BTW, there's a Swedish consumer protection agency that responds to unfair terms and conditions (like shipping). Try to write an email expressing your concerns at the posted email address.

Hi Jon!
Steve here, The creator of THIS project. First of all, I appologise for the copyright on the image of your device. I dared to use it as i don't have a design yet, nor a box. The bill acceptor and the rest of the components are currentl;y sitting on my desk.
Second, please take the time to answer my e-mail! I seriously wanted to order a machine from you but as you have't answered my mail, i just thought you're too busy to make a buck!
Third, the recycler is not so expensive. Add up to 1000 USD for a brand new recycler, compared to a brand new NV10 (example) acceptor. I promise to bring more to the table as well as transparency. I just wanted to know how much people would be interested in this.
Thank you

Yes it is. Same link. Please explain why the project is "shady". Your feedback is valuable and i'm looking forward to answering all and any question you might have. If you check out Coinfunder, i've also completed the below mentioned information on the project page, based on the questions asked here.
Thank you, Istvan.

The money will be used for buying the following components:
- Bill acceptor / recycler
- Interface cables, if needed (for USB connection)
- Raspberry Pi
- Power source(s)
- Some sort of cheap tablet (for now)
- Outsource the creation of metal boxes
- Outsource the software dev for now, until the Python dev is available for this project
That's all i can come up for now.
I'm also helping this project out of my own pocket, but the crowdfunding part would definitely speed up and smoothen the whole thing.
