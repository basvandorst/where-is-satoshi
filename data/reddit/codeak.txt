Bitcoin and Ethereum are in an eternal dance.
An investment in one or the other is a sound investment.
If your BTC is on an exchange, sell the BTC for ethereum, then send the ethereum to the wallet.
One day in the future if you wish to convert them to BTC there should be a way to perform an atomic swap without going through an exchange.
Its just an option, dude.

He says he's willing to split the funds rofl.
This is a scam to get free money. 
Notice how it does not have a buy it now option.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:57:09
I actually agree with you.
Most people here (perhaps) are looking at the short term.
But for long term, any punches Bitcoin can take goes straight to its growth.
A shame you were down voted.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:41:56
I wouldn't say that's a premium. 
That is totally acceptable.
Now if it said 20k for a price I might agree with you.

lol wut
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:14:04
They literally could have forked the coin and done nothing but name it bcash, no block size increase, and it would still have what it has today since no one truly uses their coin, there would be no full blocks lol.

It may be a small amount of TX, but each TX is very large. This largeness takes up the 1MB size.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:56:28
I feel bad for people like you who ignore everything and blanket a large portion of the US lazily.
It just digs you deeper and deeper.
You are a good example why all sorts of prejudice is bad.

Of course. Bitcoin and Trump go hand in hand.

How long ago did you send your transfer, and what Fee did you pay?
Depending on these, you may have to just wait until it gets picked up.

Well there's a huge difference, if you are holding your life's wealth in BTC you would much rather have it on your person than trust Google with it. Right?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:03:13
The software lowers your fee automatically since you're on a segwit address. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:25:35
Yes it certainly is clear now.
Pay the BTC fee that you are comfortable with. Then let it sit in the mempool until it is selected for transfer.
Depending on how fast you want it to get there will be determined by what fee you are willing to pay.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:08:59
Just another shake of the stick.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:03:14
never of course. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:45:45
This is good news!
Good news assuming bitcoin will be the winner of course.
1. You have more time to produce income and invest into BTC.
2. BTC will have tons of open source development that can easily be taken and put into BTC, as well as keeping BTC competitive. 
WooHoo!! Call it the best dip ever! a dip without direct loss in profits, but a huge increase of cash into the crypto space. Absolutely mad if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:38:51
Exactly this.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:37:47
A lot of people do not believe that large corporations actually make money from reporting what has not happened yet rather than making money from reporting what has already happened.

Why are you confused?
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:45:52
I think you're missing the point of Bitcoin then.
They are also developing many ways to transact with bitcoin, making it seamless, cheap and reliable.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:24:34
Thats what they said with bcash.
It isn't happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:28:40
Can't remove it entirely (as it has its place for progress) but who ever owns Reddit decides if they like Bitcoin or not. Stops support for it. Gives support to what they choose. Spreads FUD.

@_date: 2018-01-20 01:33:27
Yeah well half is quite the difference lol unless I'm miss understanding something. Looks like you paid the same amount of transaction fee as OP yet wanted to send a bigger sized transaction. (double the size of course).
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:41:53

@_date: 2018-01-19 03:32:57
I imagine those who deal with large transaction volume will utilize LN and have all their interactions sent through there instead of on the blockchain directly. 
Was this the answer you were looking for?

Do you happen to know the purpose of life?
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:41:22
Yes putting money in an alt coin is just a get rich feeling people are having. It's a shame but it does get them into the crypto space, which is good for Bitcoin and Ethereum (since I am assuming they will be the winners).
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:45:09
This has nothing to do with a it being a bitcoin problem but a third party problem.
Your answer will not come from here.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:59:06
Lol. Inside trading cannot and will not be stopped. And if there is a centralized step within currency, the amount of influence is controlled is stronger. Power corrupts 100% of the time, and just because laws exist that does not make everyone abide by them. Especially when you are talking about a global currency.. makes no sense to bring law in the matter.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:12:33
Pretty sure an individual can decide whether something interests them to do research regardless where the topic or idea came from, something interesting is sometimes something worth looking into. Does not matter if a random person expressed it, the president did or if it was on a fortune cookie.
But yeah people sometimes don't have the energy to pursue convincing people and that's definitely ok.

@_date: 2017-12-13 12:22:23
First question is was is it worth? Then the second question is how far off is the current price from what it is worth? If it's worth $1 and it's currently $1000 within a month you can be sure it's a bubble. 
Problem is we haven't realized what the true value of Bitcoin is yet.

Well then I guess I will never mine cryptocurrency, as well as idk how anyone can ever come to any other conclusion. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:14:45
Get out of exchanges as fast as possible, and use them only as an exchange for fiat to cryptocurrency and as a hot wallet for day trading if you're looking to do that. Offload the rest of whats yours onto cold storage.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:38
We are definitely at the very beginning of this crazy ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:42:27
At the moment It just collects emails with instapage... My guess is it is either:
1. By a reputable company and it is in development stage still.
2. It is collecting emails for re sale to people to advertise to you directly.
I'd bet on 2. and I wouldn't send a primary email through this ever. I am guessing CommanderStrident is profiting off this personally seeing as there is no real ties to any company or persons anywhere within the website. 
Also there is absolutely no mention whatsoever of this domain ever anywhere else, and you just happened to find the first public mention of it! What a coincidence! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:45:55
1.First you buy a hardware wallet. Then your wallet tells you its public address. Your public address is your deposit address for your wallet.
You send your btc from coinbase to your wallet public address.
coinbase is better if you want to have instant access to it to day trade or to use as a "hot" wallet instead of what a hardware wallet which is considered "cold" storage.
2.People say putting 5% of your investments into bitcoin is a safe bet. Put more in depending on your trust and forecast on bitcoin as determined by your understanding of it.
3.Jobs for bitcoin, hmm, why not get paid in your current fiat then transfer it over to BTC as you see necessary? for now at least.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:48:51
The network effect is present, yes. But there is no scheme.

BTC is an ever changing and ever growing endeavor.
It is a store of value today only due to the fees that hinder it.
One day it will have all of the perks the other coins may currently have over bitcoin and it will do them better.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:00:22

@_date: 2017-12-05 18:05:35
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:36:16
If you had enough money in both exchanges, so that you wouldn't have to worry about the crazy fees and transaction times then yeah you totally could.
You can do this with any of the exchanges like with btc to eur and btc to usd and btc to eth etc etc etc across all the exchanges, you can also do this comparing how the alt coins are acting compared to bitcoin.
But its all risky stuff, since plenty could happen anyways.

@_date: 2017-12-28 02:04:40
The secret to the value of Bitcoin ( in current times ) is to compare the current exchange price of BTC to the trust ( public trust ) to BTC. 
If trust is very low in BTC, then the price is undervalued.
If trust is very high in BTC, then the price is actualized proportionally. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:09:30
Lol, this is a hard fork.
Which means that they are making a new coin based on Bitcoin.
Nothing changes with your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:26:12
That's too bad. Lol.
Make multiple wallets and keep an excel spreadsheet keeping track of them.

Over a period of time it will be physically impossible, or worth while, to mine another block. This is due to difficulty.

Would we call it the perfect storm?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:05
So you used a wallet that decided the fee for you?
I guess this is a good lesson on why you should set your own transaction fees, or at least see what the wallets setting for your transaction fee before sending it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:56:24
That is true as well.
I'd say that is also beneficial because whatever contribution to the bitcoin name sticks for the rest of time.
Even if everyone who was banking on it being purely for profit had sold their shares then those who believed in it would buy them up.
You are seeing this now, whatever "dip" or "crash" that occurs simply bounces back up, because those who do believe in it take advantage of the dip and buy back into it.
Summary is that bitcoin has a percentage of those who believe in it, and those who do not, and the percentage for those who believe in it is increasing and not decreasing. 
If it crashed to $100 I would still put in the same amount of money into it as I am now as it would feel like an opportunity. 
Wouldn't you?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:34:54

Theres probably a political reason. I'd see what their actions were following their announcement then figure out how that would help someone who knew beforehand that that would happen.
Maybe they sold btc high then dropped the news and bought at the low? All I can come up with. =(
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:29:50

It's a fucking mystery
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:24:38
Thats true. That helps Bitcoin over the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:47:45
Hard to buy into something you don't believe in.
This is common sense.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:50:06
This is true.
But whats the difference when someone puts money into the coin between someone who knows the technology perfectly and someone who doesn't know it at all?
I'd say the difference doesn't matter because the technology is the same regardless.
I'm coming from a point of view where bitcoin is being held as a currency storage, which will be extremely valuable in the future for what it can do as well as because it was first to the game and has the name to it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:46:11
Wouldn't a balanced portfolio include Fiat currency lol
