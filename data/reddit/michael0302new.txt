CoolBitX is developing a semi-decentralised exchange. Users can post orders on the exchange, the bitcoins will be sent directly from seller's CoolWallet to buyers' CoolWallet. Upon 1 confirmation, USD will be moved from buyer's account to seller's account in the exchange.

Hi, later we will release something similar to U2F but better. At the moment it is confidential now. 
The NFC charger does not transmit any data.

Exciting as Japan is giving it a big Go.

Decentralised Bitcoin exchange is the future.

Decentralised exchange is the solution.

He's got a good point.

The source code of firmware will be open, except for the code in Secure Element chip due to NDA with the chip provider. 
"Deterministically validated" means users can validate that the Seed/private keys generated in the card are not pre-programmed by the following steps:
1. Randomly generate a set of Seed using CoolWallet app.
2. Remember what Bitcoin addresses this Seed give you
3. Erase the card, then recover your wallet by entering the Seed, check if the Bitcoin addresses are the same.
4. Use another wallet that follows BIP32,39,43,44 to recover this wallet by entering the Seed, check if the Bitcoin addresses are the same.
5. Repeat the process.

We are preparing documents and open source codes on Github, hoping bitocin.org will see our effort and integrity, and consider listing our wallet on the website. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:37:52
Two ways:
1. For the Seed generated in the card, we use Infineon's true random number generator, which is verified by Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation.
2. For the Seed generated in the app, you can view the open source code to check that there is no range that anyone knew about.

You can check what the verification is here:  
You can see if the card really uses the chip by de-assembling the card and check what the Secure Element chip it is.

No one could possibly guess it because: in HD wallet, a Seed generates almost unlimited number of private keys/addresses. If the addresses are the same in every wallet creation/recovery, it validates. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 03:40:20
The app is fully open. The firmware in the card will be partly open soon. The Secure Element in the card whilst is not open, but can be deterministically validated.

What does blockchain phone really do? It simply is not a cold storage... cold storage's basic rule No1 is to keep the private keys in a offline device to avoid hijacking screen, and many other hacks. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:29:26
iphone also has a secure element in the phone. If Apple wants, they can turn all iphones into blockchain phones by adding some software features for private key managements... Still, it and Exodus are not cold wallets, but hot wallets with a bit more protection... Just a bit...

FYI, that double smash is optional.

Put it in CoolWallet. You own the private keys. It means however the chain alters, you own your coins on any altered chain.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:57:27
Store in CoolWallet. Keep it in a safe place.

Hardware wallet is safer, bro.

Buy on Bitstamp, store in CoolWallet, sell on BitFlyer.
