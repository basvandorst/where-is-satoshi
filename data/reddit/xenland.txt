Indeed it is. I have been open since September 1st. I have over 200 BTC from investors through GLBSE already. I have sold and shipped off over 10 items to 10 happy customers. I've gone to great lengths to keeping my website secure such as for example all Bitcoins are sent to an Offline wallet so even if the website get compromised there is nothing to steal.
Here is a link to this months purchased list of items: 
Here is a link to some photos a customer of mine has posted:

You could look at it like that! Indeed, cheaper alternative to tradehill and mtgox!

They are all going to vary, but for the ones you asked for specifically, they are both physical cards yes. I can get the cards ordered today but not too sure how quick they will ship it out being a weekend and all. 
In the past I tried to do Western Union Debit Cards and those reached the customer within 5 days how ever those took a little bit longer since those were debit cards and these are gift cards and don't require personal information attached to them.

Well that makes more sense now. I drop ship everything at the moment so shipping costs are flat-rate costs. I'll be posting up Smoking Accessories very soon those will be located at my business location and will have cheaper shipping costs and will be more cost effective.
Thank you for your insights of improvment, I'll keep these in mind!

Exchange rate is displayed at the very bottom of the page.
However according to my terms of service  your exchange rate isn't guaranteed. Your exchange rate will be based upon the best available exchange rate found on

Sound like a problem between Keyboard and Chair.
That's the minimum amount of bit-coins allowed to be on the card.
The price per Bitcoin is located at the bottom of the page along with the number of visitors currently viewing the website(accurate within 5 minutes).
 It use to be at the top but everyone kept trying to take advantage of price drops thinking I'd fork over the BTC exchange rate difference or something and then were getting irritated with me when I had to cancel orders since I would't pay for it out of my own pocket because of price fluctuations.

Any new emerging business takes up to 1 year before any actual income is made. I'm not getting very many customers but I'm happy I chose to go with Bitcoin as I've have gotten more business though Bitcoin then through any fiat community :D So it's looking kind of good actually after a couple of months!
@_date: 2011-10-19 03:03:10
That wasn't my first thought, but you can use my service for anything you want. The only issue I find this is when westernunion/mastercard reviews the information they might find your son/daughters social security number and may freeze account/funds for being underage. So just make sure you use your own adult information on checking out.
@_date: 2011-11-16 03:05:05
well there's your problem right there, its meant to explain how bitcoin is designed to evolve.... not explain how it works. Those types of explanations are out of the scope of this article.
@_date: 2011-11-10 14:15:56
LOL whats a neckbeard? I love it!
@_date: 2011-10-19 13:29:48
xxxoday, if your think about it tho; if the kids were paid in Bitcoins the kids could make it their choice to use my service if they needed cash on the go. If the price of BTC value with relationship to United States Dollars(USD) is dropping that doesn't affect and shouldn't effect the actual value of BTC itself or "Bitcoin Buying Power".
@_date: 2011-11-13 00:51:36
Exchange rates are never guaranteed but if you want to look at the proposed Bitcoin value you can scroll down "all the way to the bottom of the page" and you'll see an area that says "1 Bitcoin is worth $3.05"
This is the exchange rate you will get. if the exchange rate drops while your gift card purchase is in progress, I will email you before continuing with the purchase so your not loosing money.
Short answer to your question would be:
3.3BTC + 0.08 = 3.38 BTC cost
you'll end up getting: $10.07 on the card with the current exchange rate of $3.05 per Bitcoins

Www.cheaperinbitcoins.com go to the gifts section and click gift cards they are only 25cents a gift card.
@_date: 2011-11-12 19:29:08
Sure, I could just send the physical card to my business location and then when they email me the card codes I'll just forward the email to you? If this sounds good just write in the "Customer Comments" box at the check out stage and just state that you want "just want the giftcard codes and not the physical card"
@_date: 2011-10-19 13:31:23
I recommend only using Bitcoins to buy/sell anything but until Bitcoins are accepted at major stores we'll have to use a centralized system.
@_date: 2011-11-10 01:12:53
I see all the nerds are getting... uhhh nerdy.
These articles are aimed at non-nerdy people in a language they understand. I don't write these articles but I'm actively involved with the writer who does it and he does alot of PR work on trying to figure out way to "clearly" explain Bitcoin advantages to the everyday layman.
Anyways. The point is to get Bitcoins name out there... we can educate everyone in a precise manner once they are on board but right now we don't need to confuse the bagezus out of everyone with cold-hard-facts that they don't understand. Thank you -Xenland

I am the owner of Cheaper In Bitcoins and I can say that in back in September I got hit with 3 orders all over 100 BTC the system worked just fine all BTC successfully went to the offline wallet. Then I shortly got an email alerting me that someone ordered a product.
If you would like I can stand by while you purchase your product from the website and closely monitor the transferring of Bitcoins if you would like. Or if you need to purchase something in bulk 10-100 items in of one thing I can usually cut you a better deal if you email me personally as sales
My past experience with the Bitcoin community consist of winning the Bounty for creating a front end to pushpool, codename "Mining Farm" written in PHP + MySql + Pushpool and of course the Bitcoin client.
Another Bitcoiner has been so kind to Fork my project(MiningFarm) on Github and write his own implementations called "SimpleCoin"
Source: 
I'm also have a side project I work on and mostly in the planning stage called BitcoinRetail and BitcoinRetail-Lite.
BitcoinRetail-Lite will be a easy to drag and drop interface for any currently running custom PHP code to integrate with the BitcoinNetwork 
Then BitcoinRetail is to be started in the far future(unless I can find volunteers) will be a out of the box installation software thats opensource for seting up your own bitcoin store.

Good work OP I'm updating CheaperInBitcoins.com to bare the same symbol as I was using the ol' ฿ symbol. I was unaware of the similarity... uploading....
@_date: 2011-11-10 01:20:19
I have added the sources the writer was going based off of if you have any complaints take it to the forums thats where the mis-information is coming from.

If you already own a western-union/master-card debit card and you want me to refill it. just go to the product page(link below) but this time don't fill out any of your personal information. at the bottom of the additional options you'll see a "value" input, that is for typing in the amount of BTC you want filled onto the card and the best conversion rate will be chose upon filling up your card. Its takes about 12hours to sometimes 24hours before orders are fully processed, after I process them westernunion reports it takes 7 days before funds are accepted and on to the card. 
Looks like someone has already wrote a review about the service on the product page(just click reviews)

I understand that you can't use laymans terms with science its okay its not ment for science... lets use your example in a laymans mind.
"How much work did you do last night?"
See how that makes sense?
As far as quantum computers go they do have an idea about how fast they can calculate. I think the issue why quantum computers isn't in use is because they can't keep the particles contained they will always randomly disperse from the device thus making it impossible and impractical for real world uses.

Basically I'm purchasing the card and loading it with money on your behalf and the western union check out page will not let me order the card with out some type of identifyable information as this isn't a one-time use card it can be reloaded and used like a regular bank account. USA law requires all banks to record whom opens bank accounts to prevent terrorism and money laundering. If you don't trust me with the required information you can purchase the card your self(link provided below) type in all the required information your self and I can reload the card for you for only small fee of 0.02BTC.

The only cards that offer this are pre-paid gift/debit cards and they all have huge monthly fees ranging from $5.50 all the way to $10 don't even get me started on ATM withdraw fees. That being said I'm looking into cheaper solutions because I offer such an inconvenience to my customers of high monthly fees.
@_date: 2011-10-18 14:32:02
If you are not comfortable with supplying this information to me you can purchase your own card and fill out the details there. 
I also refill the cards for the same price of 0.02BTC($0.04)
