This is a solid point. In science, engineering, and everyday life we intentionally pick unit systems where the quantity we are interested in ranges from about 0.01 to 100 or so.
If you talk to chemists they measure distance in Angstrom (10^-10 meters) because chemical bonds are between about 0.5 and 4.0 Angstrom, which is much easier to reason about. However, most people measure objects in centimeters and meters since that is the scale of most objects we interact with.
It is very nice that most of what we regularly purchase with dollars, pounds, or euro are between 0.1 and 100 currency units. Even without knowing the exchange rates between those three currencies you can kind of understand how expensive something is. 
However, with BTC you have no idea. Is 0.0001 BTC a cheap cup of coffee or a very expensive starbucks drink? Turns out its a cheap cup of coffee, but you had to do the math right?

If most on-chain transactions are segwit and the majority of transactions are conducted off-chain then the on-chain fees will be much cheaper. Right now, it would cost $30 to open a channel, but it will not in the future if LN is used.

I like your answer, but I wanted to point out that O( N^2 ) is polynomial time not exponential time. Exponential scaling is when the variable is the exponent not the base. For example O( 2^N ).

I like the very high resolution image you have of your wallet. However, you have encoded your image as a PNG. PNG is a lossless image compression format that is great for digitally created images (screenshots, logos, etc). However, it is not good at compressing real photographs. JPEG encoding is the best choice for these types of files. If you encode " to be a jpeg it will be 10 times smaller and still look good. I did this for you if you don't know how:
