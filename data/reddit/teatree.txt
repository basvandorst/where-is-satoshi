Deal with reputable exchanges only.
One reason I am so wary of exchanges like Bittrex wanting massive quantities of KYC for small amounts of money (no govt demands this, not even the American one) is that they then get hacked and the hackers can see names, addresses and how much was bought.  Even if you've withdrawn your coins to your own wallet, they know where you live and can put a gun to your head to get them from you.

Coinbase *is* a proto-Lightning Network.
Because you can send coins from one coinbase user to another off-chain within the coinbase network, which is what lightning is all about.
They're not going to be replaced. They're way ahead of everyone else, and they'd hedge their bets by enabling alts too, so they survive no matter what happens.

You keep pushing that bittrex's policies were in an FAQ.
They were not. They changed them for *existing users*, without warning and then altered their FAQ without changing the date. 
Here is a thread from 4 months ago clearly saying you could withdraw 0.025 btc a day if you were unverified:
Now it's zero - but their FAQ has been altered, while keeping the date Oct 2016, to con people into thinking that was the policy all along. That is SHADY. If you change policy, notify people, and put the correct date on it.
And then here you come, redditor for one day. pushing this bullshit and defending their shadiness.
Are you an employee of theirs, and if you are, be careful, when cryptsy went down, all the staff lost their jobs...

They've managed large numbers of transactions in the past. The blocks happen every minute, which helps.

OP isn't wrong. Satoshi hated wikileaks - indeed wikileaks is the reason why he disappeared.
See the following:
This is the last message ever posted by Satoshi on bitcointalk:


Satoshi wanted mainstream attention, not attention from dodgy sources.
And then he handed over to Gavin Andreeson and disappeared.

Bittrex is trying to close down that sub because there are too many people complaining:
So it has to be on the main bitcoin subreddit to warn other users not to trust their coins to bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:17:04
The bitcoin wallet on the bitcoin.com site has bitcoin as well as bitcoincash.
So if someone goes to a bitcoin atm and buys bitcoin and sends it to their wallet, they will get bitcoin.
So no coins are lost.
What will happen here is google will investigate, conclude malicious people like you are lying about it being a phishing site, and whitelist it. And perhaps blacklist the ip addresses of people deliberately trying to waste google's time by and using them to take down a legit competitor.

Coins like Doge work perfectly for commerce, quick and low fees. It's cheap and cheerful too.
The issue is that a lot of "gatekeepers" like Bitpay refused for years to enable alts, stating that they were bitcoin maximalists and they wanted just one coin to succeed. That now bites them in the backside. For example, if Bitpay had enabled a choice of alts a year ago, they wouldn't have lost their Steam contract.

Core haven't bothered to enable segwit on the Core qt-wallet. This is despite segwit being launched nearly six months ago. 
How are people supposed to use segwit if it's not enabled - magic?

Gavin did a heap to popularise Bitcoin, it wouldn't be where it is without him. It's a crying shame the way he has been treated by the community.

There is nothing stopping people from spamming the bitcoincash mempool - though they'll probably eat it all up in a couple of blocks.
And therein lies the lesson. 
If you are so vulnerable that people *paying fees* to send transactions constitute an "attack", how on earth would you cope with a real attack from a government?
An anti-fragile coin will cope no matter what is flung at it. If bitcoin is buckling at the slightest pressure, then it isn't anti-fragile and the community needs to migrate to a coin that is. That might be BCH, or it might be litecoin, or ethereum of whatever. But it looks like bitcoin isn't it because it's cracking under the pressure. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:11:53
Or you could add options to pay with alts that confirm quickly - in otherwords the Coinbase strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:40


There is a solution: use an alt to move money. Bitcoin is NEVER going to scale, it's going to become a pure financial instrument that will be traded on various exchanges, complete with futures that are dollar-cash settled.
Today, the music artist Bjork announced that you could buy her album with cryptocurrency: a few years ago it would have been just bitcoin. But she's allowing litecoin, dash and audiocoin as payment as well. 
More and more merchants are going to do this. The fees on bitcoin make it unviable, and as we have seen from recent events, it will NEVER get dealt with.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:52:41
There is a backlog in the network which is why the fees are so high. My advice is to keep the coins in Coinbase for teh moment and check in a few days time whether the fees have come down.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:06:12
The network fees will be the same everywhere. They are the cost for sending coins from one wallet to another and having a miner validate them.
Exchange fees are different, they are the cost of actually trading bitcoin. So when you exchange your USD for BTC, the exchange will charge a % fee.
If you have already bought bitcoin at Coinbase, sit tight and wait. It's safe to leave your coins with them as they are one of the few places insured against hacks.
If you haven't bought bitcoins, then you could try purchasing from Bitstamp or Gemini, both of which have a much smaller exchange fee than Coinbase.

He paid $94 for the transaction... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:38:34
He paid 0.0112944 btc
Look at the transaction again.

The USA is not going to ban bitcoin.
Have you noticed that the free countries have all embraced bitcoin - USA, Switzerland, Japan etc.
But the totalitarian countries have banned it (China etc).
Dictators like Putin fear things they can't control, and they can't control bitcoin.

Being a trader and being an inventor are two different skills. If you had invented bitcoin and were so emotionally invested in it you thought it would go to the moon, you might make trading errors (compared to real traders who are ice cool and don't actually care either way).
Isaac Newton was extremely bad at speculation and lost money in the South Sea bubble. And John Maynard Keynes, the economist, lost money in the Great depression on the stock exchange. Do you believe that because they were *bad speculators* that means Isaac Newton couldn't have possibly discovered the laws of gravity and Keynes couldn't have discovered some laws of economics? Newsflash, speculating is a completely unrelated skill!

Because after Wired did that article on him last year, claiming he was Satoshi, he got raided by the Australian tax authorities. 
He could deal with the tax thing in two ways a) prove he *wasn't* Satoshi and hence owed no tax or b) admit he was Satoshi and make the announcement prior to selling the coins to pay his tax dues.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:01:08
I didn't realise that - it makes it even more probable that Wright is Satoshi. Because Satoshi posted this just before he disappeared:


in response to Wikileaks saying they wanted to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:58:46
The number of people interested in bitcoin at that time was tiny. The original cypherpunk details show only Hal Finney being interested. Here is the original announcement of the bitcoin whitepaper:
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:09:21
Jon Matonis is Blockstream, so people are pretending that he didn't verify Wright as Satoshi - even though he did!

Is it legal to purchase stolen data and use it to dox people like this? I'm pretty sure hacking into exchanges is a felony in most countries as is purchasing/using the stolen information - I mean why would you have copied all the MtGox stuff if you weren't a thief intending to steal using the data you have harvested? Perhaps you've used the data to steal coins already.
Also - not sure what you are trying to prove. Do you believe that someone who can invent the blockchain is *bound* to be good at speculating? Newsflash, these are two different skills. People like Isaac Newton lost a shed-load of money on the South-Sea bubble. Would the 17th C you have excitedly gone round the London coffee houses saying "Isaac Newton can't possibly have discovered the laws of gravity because he is rubbish at speculation"? 
In fact the inventor of bitcoin would be *more* likely than a standard speculator to buy at the top because so emotionally invested in his invention. So not clear what exactly that you are trying to prove, apart from that you are so *angry* that he claims to be Satoshi you are willing to break laws, hack exchanges, buy stolen personal information, all in the aim of discrediting this man and tearing him apart... What ails you, man?
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:38:03
Yes, especially if they spent time chatting about stuff and if Wright had other people to see before Gavin.
Also note that Britain is on summer time at the moment.

Just putting this out there:
the whois for that domain says it is registered to "Safer Names Ltd" - one of those companies that keeps the name of the real owner anonymous:
If you were putting your name in the domain why would you hide your name when listing the *ownership* of the domain? Unless the owner is not Craig wight? Curiouser and curiouser.

Well he works at MIT and that's near Boston, right? Have just done a search for flights from Boston to London:
They tend to leave at 18:00 Boston and arrive in London at 9:10 the next day.
Or leave at 19:15 from Boston and arrive in London at 10:15 the next day.
Or leave Boston at 21:00 and arrive in London at 13:30 the next day.
Because of time differences, it's 11 hours from North America to London (and 7 hours from London to North America). Then add in check in times.
Then add in the 1 hour you need to get from Heathrow to central london.
Given that his meeting was in the afternoon, I'd say he took the plane at 21:00 in Boston on the 7th, arrived at 13:30 on the 8th in London, spent an hour in traffic and met Satoshi at about 14:30 in Covent Garden.
