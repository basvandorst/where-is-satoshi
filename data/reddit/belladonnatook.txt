Been reading these boards since I first bought bitcoin 9/6/13 and I don't think you have to worry about trolls. To anyone who reads more than one respected news source on bitcoin, negative trolling is obvious. Just recommend that people educate themselves and read a variety of news sources; those who do that just see these trolls for what they are: pathetic.

what a beautiful and thoughtful post. I have considered the same--I bought bc at $100, but I also bought at $800. I often feel I'd like to reduce my cost basis as you did. Thanks for your post.

Thanks for your watchfulness. 
I received the email and it was so obviously spam, I deleted it without a second thought. 
I think it's a good practice, when in doubt, to delete stuff like that generally. When a bank really needs to get in touch with you, they will phone you and establish their credentials to speak to you regarding your account. In the US, it has been my experience that you don't ever have to do any banking account management via email--ever.

From Fox Business, May 2013:
One exchange that touts its regulatory compliance is “CampBX,” which is the fourth-largest U.S. dollar/bitcoin exchange and is based in Alpharetta, Georgia.
"We were the first bitcoin exchange to register here in Georgia, and we talked to the state Department of Banking and Finance to make sure we were above-board before we launched the business,"CEO Keyur Mithawala told FoxNews.com.
"I used to work for Cox Communications and Equifax, so I had a good corporate career -- there was no need to jeopardize it by doing something that’s illegal,"he explained.
Mithawala estimates that between 60 and 75 percent of his company’s expenses are for regulatory compliance. CampBX requires users to submit a government-issued ID and a utility bill before joining, he said.
"When someone submits their documents to us, their name then goes through three government databases that list suspected terrorists and financial criminals. Once the application clears all three databases, that's when we clear their account," Mithawala said.
So far, he said, he knows of just "six or seven"out of thousands of applicants who had failed that check.
Federal regulations then require that every purchase or sale of bitcoins on the site be reported to the government agency known as the "Financial Crimes Enforcement Network" (FinCEN).
"You submit all transactions every quarter,"Mithawala said. "And there are a couple other reports you are also required to file. If you detect any suspicious activity, you are required to file a Suspicious Activity Report, and then there is also a Large Transactions Report."
Mithawala said that he had seen some suspicious activity on the site in the last couple weeks and that it would be reported.
As additional safeguards, CampBX keeps track of users' IP addresses and has a 31-day waiting period before a user's first bank wire deposit to the site clears.
CampBX is currently awaiting approval from federal regulators. The FinCEN website lists CampBX, under its formal legal name "Bulbul Investments,"as having filed an "initial registration."
"It's an application in progress ... I'm confident we will get a positive decision, because we have the right policies in place," he said.
Others have also applied for licenses, including San Francisco bitcoin seller "Coinbase,"which offers a simple interface and is backed by more than $5 million in venture capital funding.
Regulatory compliance does not end with the federal rules, and each state has its own license requirements. Mithawala says that his site is in compliance with Georgia state regulations but that his company is currently reviewing the laws in others, which it also needs to comply with when users are from outside of Georgia.
"We're going to run into a lot of lawyer hours this year," Mithawala said.

are you saying this is why it went from $323 to $264 in fifteen minutes, a little while ago?  (back up to $308 now)
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:19:29
I wouldn't call it unreliable.  I would call it prudent, and working conservatively within its platform limits.  Good call by them, I think.

more importantly, it is true that the website gives an office location address on 13010 Morris in Alpharetta, whereas the Secy of State filing, which is a sworn document, gives the principal office address as Deer Trail.  I do think it's important to be consistent.  
The agent for service of process is Keyur K. Mithawala.

Who are Bulbul Investments, do you know? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:53:36
I just sat there like an idjit watching it go to $269 and not buying.
I'm new at bitcoin, bought in at $126 in September, wasn't sure the significance of what I was looking at when I saw it decline just now, lol, live and learn.

51, mom of 3, lawyer, bought my first bitcoin at $126 in September

It seems to me we're seeing less step 9 in bitcoin; people are growing more sophisticated; even newcomers expect that value will decline, that they'll hold their coins through a cycle, and that they're taking a longer term view.

Have you phoned the people at Coinbase and asked what happened?  My orders were honored four days later at the contracted price.  Yours should be, too.  Give them a call.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:10:39
and, 'bulbul' is a lovely Persian word of Arabic provenance that means 'nightingale'

concur.  Here's the info, which I'll continue to update via GA Secy of State, for CampBX/Bulbul, to which I sent a money order yesterday.  Interested in testing their system for myself.  Will let you know how we do.
I noticed too that they appear to be working out of an apt on Deer Trail, and not the more chichi mail drop.  Which is okay--plenty of corps properly use Instant Office/business center type addresses.

listen, more power to anyone who bought in recently and can refrain from checking the price all night, after that little display of volatility 15 min ago

That may be the case, but the Sharia brand is negative here.  To the US, it means a barbaric, shadow law that refuses to submit to the primacy of state and federal constitutional law. Our press highlights sharia stonings, whippings, sex segregation, misogyny, honor killings, and other assaults, batteries, and homicides, and over things as minor as the public depiction in art of a religious figure. I think the Islam, Muslim, and Sharia brand here require tending before the US congress and financial institutions would see Islam's embrace as a credit to bitcoin . . .
