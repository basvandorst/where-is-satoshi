Actually, his writing is a bit similar to his brother's. Eloquent sometimes, yet completely nonsensical at other times. I think this is legitimate. He's just gotten old and confused.

As I recall, the universal assumption was that Satoshi Nakamoto couldn't be Japanese because the English was too good. And the people who investigated into the possibility that he really was a Japanese man named Satoshi Nakamoto looked for Satoshi Nakamotos in Japan.
Also, a lot of people believed that it probably wasn't a single person. Way too highly skilled in too wide a range of skill sets.

Of course he did. In a professional setting where he needs to be respected, of course he made effort. When writing about trains or leaving an Amazon review, effort is much less necessary.

I think he actually has that in common with his brother. If you look at Dorian's posts online, some look like they're written by a perfectly intelligent person, and some by a guy who's losing his marbles.
These are the writings of old, confused men. It doesn't mean they aren't real.

Am I the only one who doesn't see anything really wrong with his english?
Sure, he sometimes doesn't bother with punctuation. He makes typos. Not everything is worded perfectly. But it's an informal setting. When it's not work related, most people online won't make the effort to construct sentences at professional quality.
