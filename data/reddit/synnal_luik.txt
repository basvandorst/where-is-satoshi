I'm still waiting on a 115sat/b to be confirmed. Its the strangest case too. Transaction was done on Dec 7 with 0 confirms and when I look it up on blockchain.info its there but not on blockcypher. I tried using the viabtc and the transaction ID doesn't exist.

its a coinbase wallet

I have a 115 sat/byte that still hasn't gone through and it was placed Dec 7. Segwit can't come sooner.

Great now the transaction ID says it doesn't exist. Is this normal? Will I get a new number or will it be the same?

I hope so. It disappeared off the blockchain cypher site when I was checking it Friday and then reappeared later that night. Thanks for answering that. I wish I could spend it up. Rent is late as is.

Is this legit? Anyone else use this service before?

Ah ok, thank you. I didn't think it would be this long. Hopefully it clears by the end of the week or I'm gonna have to sell mah body for bitcoins. That's a thing right? XD

Can you explain how it has a chance to confirm? I've never had a payment take more then 30 mins. I'm at a loss here and worrying to death that I can't get her funds.

I need to get this processed so how do I make a transaction fee? Sorry for asking the questions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:10:01
How can I do this? I'm still new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:34:40
Is there a way to get this to her faster?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:09:38
IS there a way to solve this? I'm still new.

Is there a way to get rid of the 5 sat/byte or increase it to get this transaction rolling? I'm at a loss here on what to do.
