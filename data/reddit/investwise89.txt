If you ask a person who lives in a villa, drives a nice car and so on, you will become another answer what "rich" means, as if you ask some homeless people.
But for me personally "rich" is, i can do what i want, when i want. So money is important, but not the most important thing in the world.
From bitcoin gains perspective, is someone puts in 100$ (and this is much for him) and bitcoin gains 100%, he now owns double of "much money" ... so there is really no need to calculate an exact amount of money.
Each person is happy with high gains, and as we know bitcoin... the future will be nice!
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:44:24
Next time i would response "good idea, thanks for this!" ... and look how they react. 
Play it believable. Could entertain you.
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:40:41
2021 ... 6 digits
25k ... EOY or next year (first half)
! just my opinion !
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:27:19
I want them all!
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:01:45
If you want gains tomorrow, better do not.
If you looking to generate gains in the future (months/years) it could be the best decision in your life (financial standpoint).
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:36:40


You mean this one?
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:28:09
Yeah, as you know actually iám not native speaker, so ... thank you :-D

You named it right in your own post when you say "and make a second Bitcoin network".
Network 1 (Bitcoin) and your network 2 (Bitcoin 2 or whatever) can´t "talk" together, so there is no possibility to switch coins from 1 to 2.
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:56:02
Not that bad, slow rising is healthy... 6-digit possible in future, too ;-)
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:42:56
Even more bitcoin in the next bear market
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:41:28
Independent on which platform you will buy, please teach yourself how to create own wallets in a safe environment!
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:35:49
While Bitcoin could do another nice gain, i don´t see any reason to "cheat". Just buy and hodl, it will be fine!
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:07:36
It's all about adoption.
If you or i create a better coin or copy the bitcoin code and tell, let´s say half of the worlds people to use this and they follow... then bitcoin is fucked...
But unless this happens, i think bitcoin will live a little more and becomes even bigger.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:47:00
Worst someone can do?
Buying FIAT with Bitcoin :-P
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:32:16
Not that bad idea :-D
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:13:43
Because Satoshi build / created bitcoin, he / she or they are helping millions of people in the past and also in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:25:26
But to be save, please generate a own wallet, where you store your coins.
Do not just let them on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:49:14
If you can afford to lose it (in the worst case, which should be absolutely clear), it could be the best choice to do this.
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:54:55
No, i said never 4-digit, as i think we will be above 10k forever. But only after we hit next ATH.
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:32:18
As we surpass in 2020, i think we never see a BTC in the 4-digit range compared to USD.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:17:23
Really skilled driver! 
Thumbs up!
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:40:52
Iám very bullish on Bitcoin! But speculation is not the same as investing!
There is a slight difference, but it is important.
I get a small part of something (e.g. company, apartment for rent, ...) and generate a cash flow.
I buy something for X and want to sell it for Y (Y should be bigger than X)
Only to show the difference meaning ;-)

@_date: 2019-07-18 18:10:03
Nice short video, but as i understand (visited the website for a few minutes).
It is every time the same, we just have to switch BTC to their tokens and after that we can pay with the card.
Please correct me, if iám wrong.
For me, a good card has to change BTC to FIAT only on an actual buy. So i could load a few bugs in BTC and if we are in a bull market, only have to load up after long time buying stuff ;-)
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:32:55
Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:31:40
@_date: 2019-07-13 19:57:09
You are right.
But if the number of ATM companies will increase even more over time, then the percentages will decrease because of battling between the companies.
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:34:10
I´am here a few days a week, but yes. If this was posted last week, i didn't know.
But as i saw this video today the first time, there will be much more in this sub :)

You mean, how much lambo you will get for 1 BTC ???

If she is informed in crypto, i mean if you talked a lot to her about it. Then she might find it nice.
But if she knows to less about the market, maybe it will be just a huge disappointment for her...
Hope you doing well and good luck, independent of what you decide!

@_date: 2019-07-14 08:09:38
There are ATM today, which only have 1% fee for selling. If you are not able to give this to your customers, this could be grounded to many things.
For example: Maybe your deliverer is to expensive / you got a bad deal
Any market the price is set by offers and orders. So i think it will be cheaper for all, including you.
On the other side, when bitcoin price starts to slow down and become less volatile, it will be easy to sell with low percentage fees.
Because you know how much you will earn and you don´t need that big gap for your security.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-25 12:43:30
:D thanks

100k would be a massive psychological mark, wonder what will happen after. Next crash or even more parabolic move to the upside.
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:11:31


yeah it´s like crazy!
I don´t think bitcoin will be worth much over 100.000 USD in the future after mass adaption, but on the way to this level i think there will be at least one more bubble, where the price could go insane (much more than 100.000 USD).
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:39:44
Maybe it should only shock him, but just the try is really bad. Sunny wanted to ensure, less people getting scammed.
@_date: 2019-03-22 16:37:13
Is it important if he got it by chance or was it himself? I think the idea is good!
Each of you should today equip **10 of your coins** with "buy Bitcoin".
Spread it further into the world out there !!!
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:38:31
You are welcome :)
Hopefully it will play out in the future, so that this isn't just theory anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:23:04
In my thought, we are hitting more inflation (worst case hyper inflation).
To own assets is the best what you can do.
If it´s gold, bitcoin or real estate.
All is better as money on your bank account.
To secure your overall portfolio, it is no bad idea to diversify!
Ask yourself everytime "what if"...
Iám longterm super bullish at bitcoin price, but i ask myself "what if bitcoin drop in price for many years .. or forever".
Iám also prepared for this scenario, to make sure, my wealth is secured.
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:33:17
Sure, but just for the calculation 21 is good enough.
Sadly many values are more or less just thoughts, because i can´t get the exact numbers like actual people who owning / using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:21:53
With 5x leverage, sure! ... 
(irony mode off)
Short (at futures) is risky any time, iám more the buy, hold, sell high, rebuy low type of investor :)
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:08:25
Good points, totally! One only thing, i must admit is, if the correction takes more time, the result should be better and more healthy for the market... just my thoughts about this

@_date: 2019-11-16 06:31:31
Agreed, never spend to much so you don´t have to worry in downward times.
Longterm, this could generate a very nice side income (at least).
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:14:21
If we hit the next top ;-)
Look here only at dashed line "top" \~ round about 63k at this moment... still rising!
Maybe also interesting for you (my own post):
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:08:39
Iám in at 200%. All my FIAT, sold my car, my house and wife ... ;-)
Jokes by side, iám started in 2016 with building a base knowledge about crytocurrencies, started bitcoin.
In the mid of 2017 i´am startet to invest, just for the longterm (hodl).
Iám only bought unter prices at 5.000 USD and started again after the big selloff last year.
So far i´am in the red counts but i do so belive that this will go up again, it is really one of the biggest chances for everyone living in this epoch!
And about your question: Yes, iám big in this game but not 100%. You should always be able to buy more, if the price goes down ;-)
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:35:00
In my calculation i count the blockchain wallets.
If you know a better base to count the actual users, iám happy to hear more :)
Combined with the exchange users, this value should be very near at the correct number at this point.
**EDIT:** *Just for reading and understanding you are right, i removed the word "addresses" in this post and changed it to "wallets". Now it should be clearer.*
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:59:26
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:59:21
Correct, but you can find addresses with multiple outgoing coins (big timespawns).
This type, could be insecure, if you don´t sign it totally offline.

**So many people searching the ground of their problems elsewhere.**
**Wake up! You are responsable for yourself! Act as an adult!**
If Bitcoin generate big losses, bigger than you are okay with.
Why the hell, you invested more than you can afford to lose ???
You should learn the basics, before starting in investing / trading or what ever you did to yourself.
And yes, this sounds a bit harsh, but you don't learn it the other way.
So get this info an put it in your head, so you will get a great future.
It is not that hard, if you know how to play.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:08:34
Lost 3.4 BTC ... no problem, if you have 100 or more.
If not... why you risk so much ???
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:36:34
Yes correctly, but often it plays out.
Please check my comment.
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:12:00
**I see it this way:**
\- Yes, on the long run, most of the people share all the same idea (BTC will increase in value compared to USD for example)
\- Yes, in trading the "crowd" is often the loser and doesn't earn money on the long run
\- No, this will not a problem and you shouldn't lose your idea on the first point and value increase
**Here is why:**
\- People who trade, will often lose much of her BTC volume and also lose trust in making money with Bitcoin (even if this doesn't stand in a direct way)
\- People who say today "i will hodl forever" will change her mind, if we break several big numbers (yes, not all, but many)
\- Bitcoin will increase in value as long people believe in it and as long it increase in value, people believe :)
In the future, there will come a moment, where an other currency will lead the space, but this does not appear in days or weeks, it will took years and decades.
**So in my perspective, Bitcoin is at this moment one of the (possible) best performing assets you could own.**
But never invest more, as you can afford to lose!
@_date: 2019-10-16 14:58:14

In one word: No
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:41:36
It is the same with all assets.
If someone never owned gold, how should he or she starts?
If someone never owned shares, ...
So for every financial decision, there is a minimum in self teaching needed.

@_date: 2019-08-10 11:36:08
And we see the dump!
Don´t get me wrong, iám hyper bullish middle and long term on BTC!
**Why i started this post? To show some of you, how to do not so risky trades.**
For my, when i choose a direction for my trade, i retest my strategy with checking the "market situation".
And if the most people think we go up, often (not every time) it turns out the opposite.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:24:07
In the long term you are right, but such changes will take many decades, so now we can profit or lose. It´s up to you.
@_date: 2019-10-25 10:00:13
Problem with cash is potential hyper inflation.
If the crash comes, it will be very fast.
I wouldn't recommend to hold much cash, only assets, which are not controlled by third party.

But you are right, nice reasons why Bitcoin will increase in value!
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:00:21
It doesn´t work this way. Marketcap is only calculated by the "latest" transfer.
100 people own 1 BTC, but only 1 person interact today and sell 1 BTC for 10.000 USD, this would be the new bitcoin price.
*( in this simple scenario, there was only 1 buyer and 1 seller, but it should help to show how it work )*

Short term, i don´t see any big positive effect (independent what comes out)
Long term, no question iám super bullish on bitcoin ... even without ETF and such kind of stuff

Look at the grey values:
154.000 USD and 618.000 USD

Wow, this is huge difference.
Is there a stats section, where i can find the number of online members on exact timestamps?
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:10:34
I do 100% agree!
The word "if" is the important part of my message!
Nobody knows, that is correct.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:18:51
If - any really only if !!! you can afford to lose this money, then it would be okay. Most money is made not by own money, but i think it´s here different, i think you would be panic selling if we see a 40% drop. Think about it and hope you know what you are doing.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:06:25
I would not say anything to strangers. Family &amp; friends - you should introduce them to bitcoin and show the benefits!
But yes, never tell anyone how much exactly. Same as you never tell your bank stats or money in your mattress.

I don´t say it for sure. Nobody knows how this will play out. But yes, i think there is a growing future for Bitcoin, in community and as well in the price.
Low after ATH should be between 70 - 90% as you see the past.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:09:02
"But why should I not drop my entire saving's on it" - no more words ... sounds like FOMO
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:55:01
Sure maybe, but if you look for example at technical analysis in charts, there will be everytime the "best fitting scenario".
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:09:18
I would say cashing near ATH and rebuy near Bottom is quiet smart.
But i agree on the long run. At this moment and for the last years, i believe more in BTC as in any other currency ...
EDIT: Only if you know something about chart analysis. Not if it´s gambling for you!
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:05:19
What if it moves sideways ... :-P
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:35:38
In my opinion, there will be 3 cycles until 2030
2021 | between 140,000 and 180,000 USD
2025 | between 500,000 and 600,000 USD
2029 | finally break the 1,000,000 USD
( just my thoughts, no guarantee )

It was a massive up move, but not the ATH. Not even in the same year.
But you find 230 in the values at the top.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:49:36
If you "trade" ... 0 - 364 days between buy and sell =&gt;  personal income tax rate (up to 45%)
If you "hold" / "hodl" ... 365 days + =&gt; tax free
Country: Germany
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:00:18
Yes, correctly. I wanted to change this, but forgot it.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:27:02
No chance, i buy all at 1 cent ... much, but i think maybe someone will give me 2 cent / coin in the future :-P
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:54:07
How long it took, after you saw the fast up move until you decided you wanted to buy ...
Don´t get me wrong, for the long run, it´s a good idea to buy but i think in your case it´s called "FOMO - fear of missing out".
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:09:34
Depending from your trading time frame, use different video parts
[ (*irony mode on*)
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:47:12
Not true! It doesn't count as a stock or capital gain. It´s like selling "stuff", so in Germany you pay taxes in high of your personal income tax rate (up to 45%).
BUT if you hold 365 days or longer, without selling. You don´t have to pay any taxes on this "trade".
@_date: 2019-10-30 10:26:20
But we can profit from that.
Idea in short: Never hold much cash, buy assets (best case, without 3-party)

Maybe Satoshi will call and ask for his genesis block seed!
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:07:28
You are right, the numbers at the top are the extreme changes per year.
If you look at the bottom "ATH to ATH" you found the same values, as in your answer.
Slightly different, because of chart zoom factor:
@_date: 2019-06-10 12:59:24
**1 USD**
1,00 is 1.00
**1000 USD**
1.000,00 is 1 000.00 or 1,000.00
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:04:52
No, i don't talk about a time in this post. It is only the calculated way, if we look at the past.
But in my opinion, the next ATH could be in Q3/Q4 of 2021 (4 year cycle)
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:13:18

As long as the difficulty does not change, it won´t matter much for the price.
Because the bitcoin mined in one year from now, will be much more electricity intense than the bitcoin mined today = higher in price.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:57:30
Wouldn´t wonder if we see at let´s say 110k a 30% drop before running to the final ATH.
Bitcoin was often good for 30-40% corrections while remaining in bull market direction.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:13:48
And the article is wrong with own statistics... 
look at the picture ( [ )
18.1 Million  with **more** than 1 USD
6.1 Million  with **more** than 100 USD
Meaning... 12 Million with less than 100 USD !
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:06:57
I think 100k will start an extreme FOMO run. It is not only a huge number, it's psychologically a important one.
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:47:34
If bitcoin would be the main currency, the whole world will use it. The price jumps would be much lower in a percentage way.
Today "nobody" own some bitcoin or use it on a daily base. Early days, great future ahead!
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:03:10
There are many possibilities in tax right, but in short there is a "first in first out" rule.
So if you can 100% show when you had bought and when you did well (with separate wallets), it should be no problem to sell the 2017 coins first (tax free).

Iám from Germany and i love cash but:
\- i do never have big amounts of cash with me (safety)
\- i only use cash instead of a banking card, because it´s faster, easy to track my own outgoings und cheaper (some bank accounts get a few cents for each transaction)
\- nearly 90% of my money is in investments (not only crypto like bitcoin, but all is better than minus 2% every year on bank account or cash)
If bitcoin in the near of the next ATH, i don´t have any problems with using them ;-)
Lightning for example, would be a preferred way for small amounts.

The first numbers, are per year significant high und lows.
The ATH to ATH should be clear.
EDIT: It´s german format of value... so 0,39 (germany) is 0.39 in US... sorry for that, wanted to change it, but forgot.

If you bought at these terms:
\- do NOT invest money, what you need
\- do NOT invest in assets, you don´t understand
Than all should be fine, wait a few month / years and it will be a good investment.
BUT if you sell now because of panic, your lost is real.

But think it this way...
If someone bought gold, he or she might want to own this unlimited as well. Just as an insurance for bad times or in the old years to buy something meaningful.
If you want the best profits, you have to sell at highs and rebuy at lows, like in any other asset. But if you just want a pice of the cake for your future, hodling is a nice and easy way!

2019 - $ 3399 ... just to be correct ;-)
2022 it should be around 30 - 50,000 in my opinion (lowest price of year)

"borrow cheap and pays a high yield" ... one is false.
**But i would say:**
If you lend money, for a very low yield AND you are 100% able to pay it back, it could be a good decision BUT
Only if you earn more money with that or if you put it in assets which increase in value.
And even i love bitcoin, for this i don't recommend to get a loan, never!
You will be getting weak hands and sell in panic on a big drop.
Lend money for your already working business and scale it!
This is how you made money, with lending money ;-)
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:39:39
I believe so much in this, for the next two years.
Even if the price did not reach 100k, i will find someone who buy for this price :-P

Perfect thoughts of mine, are when the btc is up and the crash start to run, then on the bottom could be many nice opportunities for the long run. S&amp;P yes, but also so many other like dow and so on.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:31:48
"I don't think that BTC will drop below 5$k ever. " ... fine, but how you react if it drops let´s say to 3.000 USD ???
Please don´t money, unless you could lose it and won´t matter you at all!
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:42:57
**My thought on it:**
Put some money (what you can afford to lose) in BTC and hodl... live your life...
Next ATH (in the near, there are many signs) you starting to sell in steps.
Then if we bottomed (in the near, there are many signs) you start buying back in.
Repeat until you have enough ;-)
And if you don´t now what i mean with "signs in the near", than you should do your homework first, it will pays out a lot!

True, with paper wallets, you have to generate a new one each time for all the Bitcoin, which you don't spend.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:14:29
One question for yourself: Are you prepared for both scenarios...
**Scenario 1**: Prices moves higher and higher... over 20k and higher... how you would feel? Maybo FOMO buying in?
**Scenario 2**: Prices goes down... 4k "nice" ... 3k "yeah, a new chance" ... 2k "oh, something wrong here" ...
I think you get what i will tell you. Nobody knows, but you can prepare yourself for both directions. If you not invested in BTC, you should buy a little (maybe 30% of your bag), if it goes lower, perfect next buy! If not, you are already invested, so you could sleep well, as before ;-)

@_date: 2019-12-07 10:55:02
I assume that you don´t need this money in the next year for living or something else.
I assume you don´t own bitcoin and it will be your first purchase.
Make 3 splits, buy now (33%) and if it drops hard buy more (33%).
Last 33% you could put in overtime (every week / month).

If you can lose it and you don´t need the money for the next .. let´s say 2-5 years, maybe the best idea in your life ;-)

Good point, i think the "crash" could be faster. Some people say it could start in 12-18 months from now, which would at the same time, where crypto space could bullrun.

So if your portfolio is big enough, it would be great. But "don´t put all eggs in one bag".
I would recommend, to diversify your new wealth in the future.
Independent from this, some people already makes her living from traveling and drive a youtube chanel or something like that.
Could be an option for you?
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:45:31
If you are sure about bitcoin and your research ist done, this is what i would do (but you have to make your own decision obvious):
\- first i wanted a "save deposit" ... 3 - 12 months of my monthly spendings (if anything go wrong, it is a huge help)
\- then i would start with 30% of my planned investment in BTC directly (if i not own some at this time)
\- 70% could be done month by month or "buy the dip"
Wish you good luck again :)
100% of bitcoin investment not equal to whole investment money (for me).
Some will put 10% in BTC and diversify in other assets.
Some will put 100% in BTC ... your own choice.

There is no "black" or "white" as 100% right or wrong. You don't have all informations which were necessary to understand my move.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:11:50
More or less yes. You are trading your money for an asset and hope it will increase in money value over time.
If you invest in a company, this is basically the same thing.
Out there are a lot of people who will tell you, that bitcoin will be the "only money" in the future. I don´t think so, but i see a lot of benefits which comes in the next years.
No financial advise!
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:48:45
Yes, i have invested in Bitcoin, but under the basic rules "no more, what you can afford to lose".
Basically the question is how long you want to invest in something.
Apart from crypto space, iám also invested in some P2P kredit platforms (like Mintos for example).
This brings me 10-12% per year. But this is even not super secure.
Nothing is 100% safe, can´t tell this often enought.
Bitcoin is in my opinion on the long term a really big chance, but we have to be fair to ourselves, and accept that there is no guarantee.
If you invest in different asset classes, where you are informed enough, then i think you will earn much money over the time. Good luck :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:18:19
The definition of "rich" for me is getting money constantly. Meaning your monthly cash flow should be extremely positive, multiple incomes and most of the incomes scalable and passive.
Bitcoin could more like a helping hand to achieve enough money to start your business or better, for you to now if something went wrong, you have access to much money in reserve.
With this thinking, you could do amazing things!
Hope this helps a little :)
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:23:50
For the future its heavy to say, but when i look at some coins in my portfolio and the changes in the past (BTC &lt;&gt; Alt) then i have to say, i lost at this moment 30-60% depending on the coins in compare, i never changed my BTC for that.
Today i won't change this bags, because it´s all for the long run.
If you believe in your coin, fine... maybe there is a bright future!
If not and important, if you don´t have any BTC i would recommend, you choose the big father of crypto BTC :-)
No financial advice!
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:01:41
For me the question would be, what i do with the money i get from a BTC sell.
If i had an other asset where i trust it will be increase or hold it´s value, then i would sell some, but never all!
If i had the idea that at this moment nothing is looking good (maybe start of financial crisis), i would be patient as before.
You should be prepared for all possibilities, otherwise FOMO would appear anytime.
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:08:36
Absolutely no idea, tell me if you find out ;-)
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:26:08
No one knows whats maybe coming in the next years. So far this is all pure speculation.
But in my opinion, prices like 4-5.000 USD for 1 BTC is not that bad, if you want to enter.
Maybe it will build a double bottom, so the prices could go to 3.100 USD, but this is speculation again.
If you don´t have any bitcoin at this moment, i would go in know, but in small steps.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:22:43
"Is it smart to go all in" ... no! Never, independently which asset...
