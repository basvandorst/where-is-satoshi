Yeah, that strategy is like the holy grail - best thing is human experience, even AIs are bad because they can only use history and not cross information prediction. That's why I decided for a HODL approach with swapping to the big game while shoving profits on the altcoins.

Once you have installed Bitcoin core wallet, create a new empty wallet. It start's syncing. You can abort it, then import your wallet copy and wait for sync finishing. It might spit out some value on it very fast since 2011 is on the beginning of the syncing content. Try to find what the address is associated with that wallet and look up the address in blockchain.info then, maybe it holds on that address directly the BTC amount, if it's empty, don't directly cry, let the Bitcoin core sync to the end. If it's empty then, cry. But first, cross fingers for no password or a known password ;-)

3 words can be easily bruteforced if they are next to each other, even easier when the attacker knows the position. Though, if they are randomly deleted throughout the whole sequence, this will get trickier to bruteforce. It is still possible with enough time and CPU power.

@_date: 2018-01-01 15:33:32
It's probably a Bitcoin core wallet. You can import it in  and hope that it isn't encrypted by a password. Otherwise you will have to find a corresponding password. Since it was kind of a present, back then in 2011, even a "small" present of some bucks will be a huge gain to now. You should be thrilled, once you get access to it. If you are lucky $10 back then might be $50k now. Be careful of who wants to help you, and never give away this wallet file.

I am writing a trading bot right now (swapping gains from other currencies to Bitcoin and HODLing otherwise) and I am a bit familiar with web scraping due to Pokémon Go bots. So actually I had the same question like you 3 days ago and looked for APIs, almost everyone only offered back to a certain date, or would have needed to many requests to get all data, or didn't have historic data at all for later than 3 months. So I needed to be a bit inventful.

You can tx your BCH from blockchain.info wallet to an exchange with low fees since BCH is not BTC. There you can trade it into BTC and even cash out into cash after that. Also, you could just hold the BTC and wait until fees go down etc.

First, copy this file. Do not do anything with the original file and only work with the copy.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:05:58
If the address exists, you probably got a transaction to it? Have you checked the transaction history?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:26
There is no way for you to track the transaction ID in the case of a withdrawal from an exchange to a wallet. The other way around would be easy. You should see the transaction in the cryptopia interface somewhere, though and a status as well. If you did not misstype the address you are very likely to receive the coins - check the fees, too. They might have been high.

Two wallets with two pins, one is the real, the other one is a bait. If you get robbed and forced to, enter PIN - second wallet opens, robber gets some small coins just enough to be happy. (As far as I understand it, wallet 1 is deleted in that very moment, so you need to have another cold backup of your real wallet 1.)

Auto verifying script is the thing you are looking for. Have a look at [GitHub]( I'd bet all my XRP that there's already one in there. Then you have a big problem less, the time. So you can fully concentrate on possible mistakes you made.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:14:51
It is definitely possible to automate this process - splitting an exisiting wallet balance into an multiple equal fractions of that balance distributed on single wallets. There are two big issues though. The first one is the lowest denominator amount - obviously 1 sat would not be suitable for it, but maybe 5000 sat which would be 1$ at a price of $20,000 per BTC. The second issue is that you need transactions which actually go through to create these addresses, and this could eat up their actual value after the deposit. Even with just 1 sat/byte you are tied to a minimum of around 5% "deposit fee" of this process. Now think what happens with today's "safe" fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:15
It's right now officially investigated. So there will be a result in some time.

Copy the file and open the copy with a text editor to look into it (requires non-password encrypted wallet).  
You might see the public keys which act as addresses in the address format of bitcoin. You can look them up separately on blockchain.info to see if one holds some bitcoins.

Nice to see actual content post. Your idea to lighten up the blockchain itself is interesting for a micro node network on top of the mining full node network in my opinion.

I am sure that those kind of transactions are double checked in general. With the insane bitcoin boom during the last days they probably just don't have enough workers to verify them. Keep in mind, Kraken is still a very small company compared to its traffic.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:42:20
Well, the smallest unit in bitcoin is a satoshi, one 100-millionth of a BTC or one 100-thousandth of a mBTC. So your approach will fail. However, you can split your 0.001 btc in 100,000 Satoshis, each staying in a single address, creating them by 0 sat/byte transactions which have a very low possibility to go through. Thinking this to the end, it theoretically is a way to make transactions without fees by just handing over the private keys of these nano-wallets. So one coffee is 0.2 mBTC or 20,000 addresses you hand over.

Mining difficulty is based on the total mining power, forcing on average a 10 min block interval. When the fixed mining reward is going down the already saturated mining market will go down and so will the mining power, resulting in an equlibrium of difficulty, miners and energy consumption. Fast forward when almost all coins are mined, transaction fees are the onliest thing income for miners - the equilibrium described above will adjust accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:32:25
How about a Paypal style? Only for registered customers, force low fees with long wait time, lend the money before to the seller before the buyer transaction is through.

Ask him HOW he bought them - Cash at an ATM or another dude he knows, Credit Card on Exchanges, Bank Transfer, did he maybe even mine it in a pool? Then check old bills, receipts, bank statements. Also go through all backups you have on the hunt for a wallet file often ending with .dat or .json.backup - you can also try to recover his emails on different online wallets, look if it is in their database.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:40
In the current state of transition, you will compare with FIAT currency. In these early days see BTC as "gaining" value of FIAT, it will then change to FIAT value is lowering in comparison with BTC value. In the end-state you will have BTC as a economic currency by itself and have it's intrinsic value of technology and the networks itself.

Hi, finally on a desktop. This is a full working script. Hope it helps:
    
    incomplete_key = "abc"
    chars = "1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    for i in range(1, len(incomplete_key)+1):
        for j in range(0,len(chars)):
            key = incomplete_key[0:i] + chars[j] + incomplete_key[i:]
            print(key +"
")
will result in 










  
Just change the ``abc`` key into your private key. I directly customized the code for you, knowing the first letter is a ``K``. If you are unsure, though, change the first for-loop starting at 0.  
  
You can start the script at any linux/mac with standard python environment by ``python script_file_name.py`` in the directory where you saved the script as ``script_file_name.py`` via console. On Windows you should install a suited python environment and look up how to run it with a script.
  
As another wrote somewhere below, this script could be extended by auto decrypting and PGP checking the private key and the public key (your address). But I couldn't write it ad-hoc since I'd need to research the exact PGP mechanism used in wallets as well as testing it on own examples. Also, if you are missing two letters, this could also be managed. The time demanding isn't thaat much higher. It becomes tricky if you are missing 3, because the number of possibilities becomes really high due to sorting of the single missing letters.  
  
Let me know the outcome!
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:09:12
Thank you very much. As techy and app developer myself I am happy to test out your app regarding ux.

Really, that'd be my first Lambo I cruise by bitcoin. I like your step towards the adoption of Bitcoin but be aware, that you need to consider the current downsides of Bitcoin as "everyday" payment method. It is important to know that your main concern will not be the height of the fees but the amount of time a transaction takes or even the chance of it not arriving when the payment fees are selected too low. Regard these options:
  
 A) The customer will to pay you high fees  
 B) Indirectly take over the fees by yourself  
 C) Look out for lower fee crypto currencies.  
  
I am a Bitcoin believer and totally standing behind the technology. You just need to do it the right way or take a by-pass as long as LN isn't implemented, yet.

The whole "ownership" you think you have just relies on trust you are bringing towards coinbase. If you would withdraw the BTC to your own wallet you would actually own the private keys (this is basically your bitcoins itself).

There are exactly two uncertainties tied to Bitcoin which may be it's down-fall.  
  
 1. Regulation risk by governments making trading and possesion illegal (like gold back then or even drugs e. g.)
 2. Security risk for private HODLers getting robbed on street or at home because wealth in Bitcoin is easier to obtain than wealth in institutional banks  
  
Anything else is easily solved by evolving technology.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:53:16
Nah, not at all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:13:57
I can totally understand your feelings right now. First of all, don't be desperated, your money is most probably not lost. There are 2 outcomes:  
  
 - The transaction may take a big while and goes through  
 - The transaction is stuck and will be reset to your wallet where the amount comes from  
  
Overall, it just takes time and you will need to be patient. Begging for manual confirmation will most likely not work here. First, the people and technology which decides what transaction is part of the next block won't access your informations of that post. Second, it's just a standard transaction even if it is very personal and important for yourself.  
  
Regarding your story, waoh! It's so nice to see what Bitcoin stands for and those ugly stories about drug funding etc. are all shadowed by this bright subreddit day after day. Wish you and your mother the best. Does she already know her luck?

Well, all you have to do is starting with blockchain block 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:53:53
As long as the first confirmation of the transaction isn't through, they won't show up in a target wallet. You have two options now. First, try to find out the transaction ID and see that it's still "under way". Second, just wait. Worst case will be the transaction times out and the coins go back to it's original source, your btcdirect account.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:57:52

The technology behind bitcoin is a revolution. While it only slowly adopts to user's need, the core dev team is incredibly competent and really wants to do it right at first try for any step-by-step wide market features. This is called as scaling the healthy way, while there are a lot of other coins which force scale the hard way, resulting in really good usability in this very moment but reach their border even harder at a later stage.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:10
It would be an attempt to hold on your people but due to the very realistic lack of open source code as a gov product, it can't succeed. My guess is that it could really be introduced by a lot of gov, with the EU countries pioneering but without transparency, which requires the system to let loose any control, it has no future.

In general you need to be in possession of your keys. When the fork happens, you will have both type of coins, reflected by the keys of that blockchain technology. If there are compatible wallets you can import your keys which will result in the respective coin. Best example is the 1 AUG BCH fork of BTC. You can import your old keys into either Electrum or Electron-BCH wallet and see and use your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:42:44

1st rule for investments, the market always goes down shortly after a buy. Yes it will stabilize and reach a new all time high. Keep in mind you are here for long term investments of money you can completely afford losing right now. Otherwise get everything out and come back when you have some spare money.

While it gets closer and closer to a big correction downwards, it is still hard to identify the return point. The hype is too big right now to make any clear assumptions of the trends in the coming weeks. There are two possibilites:  
  
 - Long term: Buy now, take risks, will get higher during the next months  
 - Short term: Wait for next dip, very high risk right now to lose money.

You don't get it :-D You have probably 10% more of FIAT value just because you own Bitcoin and therefore also BCash from the 1 AUG fork. You don't need to give your Bitcoins out of your Electrum storage but you can download Electron-Cash and just import a backup there to have the same amount of BCash.

You might want to start an open beta with virtual funds around 3 months before launching. People get used to your site and interface as well as spread the word.  
  
A big problem with exchanges is KYC/AML as well as all the FIAT regulations which you have to respect when funding with FIAT money. Otherwise gov pulls out your power-cord and pushs you in jail.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:20:58
That's a serious issue, so you shouldn't invest at all. Because this implies a no trust in Bitcoin and collides with your initial investment motive.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:34:18
So you probably invested too much.

Well end users of FIAT are also vulnerable of open street theft or robbery as well as forgetting their wallet in the train. Worst though is parked money on bank accounts which slowly desintegrate in value as well as banksters being the problem by itself.

Well, you can estimate the GH/s of your 1070 with a webserche. After that use whattomine.com for some ideas around the costs. Then just leave it alone, because it just doesnt make fun. Like said below, Ant S9 for $5000 on ebay and $300 electricity bill as well as an abandoned but great internet/electricity garage is the minimum you need to get anything out of it. So think about an $6000 investment for maybe getting $3000 in return, leaving you at $-3000 before difficulty adjusts that it will not net you any profit anymore.

The issue is, that you can't say where you fucked up. With my understanding of permutation is that you can still brute force it by stating the letters you have are indeed correct, but you don't know how to place them, also one is missing. However, you need an offline working script with automated checking and some really good computation power and let it run quite some time. Writing an algorithm for it is quite time consuming at first, too. One initial assumption could be made like:  
"The fuckup is that I switched letters in the neighbourhood of +-3, moving that window from start of the sequence to the end while simultaneously inserting the one missing letter possibilities."  
This is probably an easier to solve task while being a reasonable assumption of human error. It nails down the number of combinations to around 120 million, what is indeed brute force-able. But only by with a complete automation.

The whole price is determined inside exchanges right now, since there is the high fee issue as well as the complexity due to higher market cap and more stakeholders, for me it concludes to an easier recovery since this trading money won't leave the exchanges as BTC -&gt; real wallets.

You know this is a once in a lifetime chance, and trap. If you have money which you can afford to lose, the decision is up to you to sink it into BTC or not. Since you are already in this forum, I highly assume that you have skin in the game. If the skin is in since January since the majority complaining right now, I totally understand you - however, this is probably due that it was more money than you could afford. Keep being positive, lose it all or get into green later if it wasn't more than you could afford.

Sadly, the "research" is just an extrapolation of today's market sentiment and vague interpreted fundamentals.

Temporary adoption rises awareness across the population.

So this means wallets like blockchain.info have one address as standard while hard drive wallets like electrum have the standard to generate corresponding addresses while old addresses will still result in the correct target wallet when used. Just to recapitulating it for personal understanding.

Far more lagging is the development time for new generations of ASICs. While during the past years and maybe 2-5 more to come, the world can catch up to the scientific and engineering level of feasability. After that the growth in ASIC computing power will adapt to the rest of the chip market.
Additional growth can only be generated by higher computation volume which is pretty much limited by nation's overall energy consumption.  
Let's make a guess. If Bitcoin survives that long and just continues growing in normal bounds: I extrapolate for 2025 to the number of 100*10^(21) H/s.

Thank you for your detailed answer. Your thought processes are sound, nothing to critize here in the first place!  
  
I do also like that you reflect on methods and approaches of valuating crypto assets. From my personal point of view I'd suggest to distance from traditional financial valuation of comapanies or exchange traded assets, but look towards unique features and snapped to the moment outlooks of/for the crypto space.

Welcome to the club. But, compare it with S&amp;P or other major indices. Assume, that any crisis in financial markets could happen asap - especially with the current world trade crisis. Think about all the 401(k)s during such a crash and the agony tied to seeing one's life time savings getting burned. Also remember that never, ever, a major index fund has had losses across a 7 year period. Now, translate this into BTC markets but with a 2 year period, while the historical gains have been much higher.  
  
Final point: Pull any money out which you can't afford to lose. Forget about the rest. So, it's either lost in 3 years or you find yourself a fortune. Both would be ok.

What I am interested in about solo mining:
How are you making sure that this nonce+timestamp combination has not been tried before by a real miner with massive hashing power compared to you? Are there random features regarding nonces or do you start at 0 and have an exact 0.0 % chance to be the first instead of a real chance which is insanely small?
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:07:22
Well I do
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:46:09
While hash power can be extrapolated to a certain degree, there is no causal relation between hash power to price. However, there is correlation which means exactly nothing. Don't understand me wrong, I am deeply interested in any model based analysis.
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:48:15

You can forget to mine directly Bitcoin using double SHA256 - it's just timewise impossible nowadays for GPUs. However, you can mine altcoins with it. Check out whattomine.com. A quick look on a Vega returns a (without any electricity cost) result in a BTC traded revenue of 0.0002 BTC per 24h, results in 5000 days, results in 13 years and 8 month and 14 days.

Since when are there reviews without having the actual device. No honestly, reading their website + input specs in whattomine.com would have been the same. Which I already did days ago. I actually expected to see it in action.

Damn, didn't expect such a good quote from an employee of one of the most ruthless banks in the world.

Well, they could spend less fees, taking same money from customers and making some more gain. Isn't the worst choice from a capitalistic point of view. The optimum would be lowering customer dollar fee, lowering the real fees by a lot and making both happy - customer and company.

You are right, but this is the beginning of innovation towards decentralization by open source.

Well, he probably gives plain code for copy and paste. Everyone reading here should demand that at least, so no scam can happen.

I moved to Electrum native SegWit bech32 today. I am happy so far, Electrum is a clean and very functional wallet. However, I am not happy with the Exchanges SegWit adoption. Hence, I do not see the bottleneck in wallet software but general user acceptance to force exchanges into the better future.

The minimum order for Stellar is more than $100 on Kraken. They have to adjust all their limits and static fees. The current amounts are from somewhere end 2016 imo.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:27:30
This is a hell big of an idea!

Smells like it's close to a short squeeze!

I do not consider it wrong, when there are attempts, even commercially, to establish smart contracts on BTC blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:50:49
Hold on litecoin and ethereum and wait for overall increase, I'd dump bitcoin-cash though since it's really on the final way down.
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:00:23
Oh well, I know the difference between centralized and decentralized. Do not get personal on an objective discussion. I pointed out my view and say: Any development is good. Decentralized is the way to go though.  
  
PS: I indeed have written a lot of code, yet. But more to come, and more to learn.

Within 3 years? Well, I guess it's possible with the declined growth rate we are now into.

This is actually a concept I'd like.

How about cryptocompare.com?
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:35:47
Yes, we download random stuff on r/bitcoin with absolute no fear of getting infected by viruses.

Dude, thank you very much for this long list. I will check each single point out of it and do some research with every future line I read in the books from A. Einstein next to me. Sad, if all true.

You did nothing good with the Bitcoin shill. I love Bitcoin, I hate Bcash, no reason to publicly fight and confuse the hearers.

You are right. In my projects I use cryptocompare.com.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:24:47
I know there are scripts already on GitHub for that case. Worst case you need 24*2048 tries. That's easily doable.

Thank you, for your effort. In respect to the CMC credibility issues earlier this year, causing a global crypto crash on its own, would you please distance yourself like the rest of the community from CMC. There are plenty of alternatives, and their websites are at least of same quality or even better.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:28:23
Ready functional script

Slow and steady - climbing to 9100 today would be more worth for the upcoming weeks than a pump to 10k
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:01:14
Let's start with mBTC. You should use the closest to $1 imo.

Download bitcoin core. Install like any other application. Start up. Wait, close. Move the data directory to external HDD, restart application. Specify data directory pointing to yor hdd. Let it run 2 weeks to synchronise. Your in the game.

Well, top post of the day.

Very nice piece. I liked it far more than the previous one.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:01:49
Pumps are correlated to low volume market times. If there is a pump this is a sign that the volume is far too low. If there is a steady grow instead, which correlates to cross market moment or new money flow into the asset, and there is high volume too, this means it is by far harder for individuals to dump the market down again.

Two times touching $7500 high ground is a nice signal for awaking asian investors.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:11:04
Welp, FOMO is happening.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:44:07
My theory is that some London investment traders are going long into Bitcoin and hitting the buy button right before goong to lunch break.

Going for it
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:11:32
I regard this wallet as the first approach to a serious hot wallet on smartphones. It has its flaws with Lightning hub trustness but so far the whole project is a big leap towards usability and the effort towards security is very high. Open source, practiced standards and the devs best intentions make this app to the go to wallet on iOS and a serious competitor on Android. Hey, who else has working Lightning, yet?
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:42:19
Decentralized exchange applications like Bisq

You can't compare percentages, you have to compare money in the market. However, even if BTC is regarded as save haven, it won't reach $300k
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:10:28
The most scary thing is that with SEPA you could transact with someone strange, unknowingly. I have no idea if there is a flagging or black listing by default in the financial sector with already small amounts of money but this keeps me thinking for a while :-/
Otherwise this is the most independent way to go and Bisq proofed its concept and security.

Yes, because "pneumonic" makes totally no sense.

@_date: 2018-12-31 16:08:08
I won't have an issue with it, when it happens. But I will not build on it. However, I personally see Bitcoin as the way to go for global independence regarding the financial sector as well as a save haven in terms of hedge versus the forming recession and a possible collapse of currencies.
