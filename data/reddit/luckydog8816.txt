That is really cool that you know how to code that kinda stuff.  Any ideas for learning how to code?  Sorry if I bothered you I am just really interested in programming.

If it is a communism. It is an ideal communism. We are not forced to share wealth between our community members, we do so by choice. This ideal communism is the ideal government overall. There is a strong community built and it does not suffer from the lack of motivation communistic societies have because you can make a huge amount of money via innovation in the community. It is your choice to spread that money around and many people do because they are better people than yourself

Sounds like a fun site but I dont understand the need for donations without concrete ideas and ways to make them happen...
