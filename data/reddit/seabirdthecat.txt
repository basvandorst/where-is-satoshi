Delivery Mechanism
"Not all commodity futures have a **delivery mechanism**; some are cash-settled on the last trading or expiration day of the contract."
It is nothing to do with your broker.
"It's a fairly safe bet that as the delivery month of a futures contract approaches, the future's price will generally inch toward or even come to equal the spot price as time progresses. This is a very strong trend that happens regardless of the contract's underlying asset. This **convergence** can be easily explained by arbitrage and the law of supply and demand." 
Forward curve/contango/backwardation,
Forward curve IS futures trading, to say they are unimportant is staggering. Contango and Backwardation (not backwardisation) are absolutely drivers of price. Forward curve is not a forecast of a price in the future, it is a forecast of what spot would be worth if carried into the future - as a function of supply/demand/cost of carry. As such, it is not a way to plan a "buy or sell." This is a longer topic, broadly misunderstood by even well educated financial market tourists (eg the Financial Times). Contango and Backwardation on the forward curve have literally nothing to do with spread between spot and futures price.
 
I dont think your post was entirely helpful, and neither entirely accurate.

If you are short the futures, and the market goes down you will receive daily margin in your brokerage account, from your broker.
If you are short the futures, and the market goes up you will have to pay daily margin from your brokerage account, to your broker.
If you don’t have enough in your account your position will be closed and the broker will return what remains of your initial margin into your account.
Interestingly, large upside moves on futures/underlying often cause basis to move higher for exactly this reason, as people have to liquidate the underlying to get cash to fund margin calls. Basis can be said to have an inverse relation to large upside moves on the futures.

Not even initial margin? 
They are only irrelevant if you don’t understand them!

"I think the CBOE one right now is F8, G8 and H8"
The letter refers to the contract month, not the ticker.
F= Jan
G= Feb
H= Mar
The number refers to the year
8= 2018
The exchange has their own tickers, but sometimes data providers (reuters/bloomberg/futuresource) will use their own.
In the case of bloomberg they are using BTC for CME, so the jan 2018 contract ticker is BTCF8.
For CBOE it is XBT, so the jan 2018 contract ticker is XBTF8.
You are way off on a lot of very basic stuff - you should probably be careful giving advice on stuff you clearly do not understand.
You do speak with conviction and credibility though, but as it is inaccurate, its classic bullshitting. I don't think it is maliciously intended, just naive and misinformed.

It would be great if brokers would accept collateral vs margin calls! 
Unfortunately it is not the case, as brokers would then run huge cash deficits (they still have to pay out daily margin calls to the holder of the opposite position), and would be running credit risk - even if you own the underlying. For example; you could pledge the same underlying to two different brokers, or you could sell the underlying, or the underlying could get stolen, as two examples. Even if your broker did accept the pledge, and put safeguards in place to make sure you could not pledge the same underlying twice (which costs money), then they would consider it as making a collateralised loan for a percentage of the underlying, and charge interest (again costing money). Even still, there is a risk of divergence between the underlying and the futures. It is an absolute non-starter. 
Trades in the future without daily settlements are otc (over the counter) forwards/swaps. You run counter party credit risk, and generate market risk when you trade this way. One of the main advantages of a futures exchange is the reduction of counterparts risk (the exchange is your counterpart, not whoever you bought/sold from/to). You also do not generate market risk, as the market risk is settled every day by margin calls.
To trade otc forwards/swaps with an institution you will then need an ISDA. As per the film “the big short” these are not easy to get due to minimum capital threshold. Then, were you able to trade them, there would be a discount applied due to the credit and potential market risk your counterpart is taking on.
Further adds to the disagreement with initial comments about a “free lunch” from futures trading being hard to achieve.
I am pretty sure I am not mental, but happy to hear if you have further thoughts on that.

The initial margin requirement is 43pct (I think, would need to confirm) for cme.
I would guess your reserved margin is bigger than this?
If so, the daily margin calls are automatically added or subtracted from this additional reserve until it is exhausted, then you get asked to add more money to your account. I guess maybe misleading to talk about daily margin calls when on a retail account this is happening at the backend -&gt; as opposed to an institutional account.
It’s not “fancy talk.” It is the terminology of futures. 
If you do not understand that you do not understand, then you have a long way to go.
Alternatively, I need to reconsider my career, as this is what I do for a living!

I would not say that I was "staggered." I just thought your reply was a little nonsensical.
Its not an alt account, just an observer who decided to open an account and reply to correct some perceived inaccuracies. I am, however, quite confident that they are inaccurate.
I do fundamentally disagree with you. I did not repeat your reply, let me try again.
Your comment that delivery mechanism is linked to the broker you are using is an absolute inaccuracy. It is rather a contract terms/specification issue, where the delivery mechanism is defined.
Convergence is something that only happens when you have an underlying AND a futures contract. Without a futures contract there is nothing to converge to the underlying. As such it DOES rely on a "contract to force it." On another note, if the delivery mechanism does not function correctly, then convergence will not occur. There are multiple examples of this on existing futures contracts, and is a key criticism to the exchange when it does not occur - it does not always occur.
The forward curve has nothing to do with plans to buy or sell in the future - it is not a forecast of price in the future. As said, this is a complex topic, and easily misunderstood.
Contango and Backwardation are not to related to the spread between spot and front month futures. These terms/market structures are related to whether deferred futures contract prices are at a premium, or a discount to nearby futures contract prices. 
I think its pretty clear that your explanations are different to the above. Your reply stated "I would suggest you stop trying to sound impressive and start trying to help your fellow coiners." Irrespective of whether his reply was worded to sound "impressive," I do not think that stating your clearly flawed understanding of the function and mechanism of futures contracts is "helping coiners."
To make a quick comment on your initial post. There is no free lunch in terms of arbing spot vs futures - requiring funds for margin calls, and getting stopped out of hedges at a loss, on a volatile derivative can very easily turn a "guaranteed" profit into a disastrous, crystallised loss. Not to mention if convergence does not occur. Speaking as someone who has been on the wrong and right side of trading for convergence in established futures contracts!

why should I know that? I am guessing you are referring to "Think or Swim?" i do not have omniscient knowledge of which brokers provide trading access to which exchanges/contracts!
your broker is "reserving" margin from you - initial margin and a slush fund for daily margin. the daily margin is being posted/received by your broker, to/from the exchange. you may not see it in your front end, but this is what happens. There is a possibility they are granting you credit 
i will take your career advice under advisement.
hopefully you have at least learned something?!

unless you get stopped out due to margin calls, or convergence does not occur. 
note that in your initial post you mention that at expiry you would "get 100usd in your bank account."
How futures actually work is you need to pay daily margin calls (on top of initial margin) based on the differential between your purchase/sale price and the settle price of the day. 
If you fail to meet your margin calls, the exchange will close your position.
