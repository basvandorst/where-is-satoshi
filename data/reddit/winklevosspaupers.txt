Well, a gold backed paper would trade at around Gold Price.
While bitcoin (not backed by gold) would trade at zero.
@_date: 2018-10-30 05:46:57
It's weird that you only consider Paper to be money, while electronic funds you see as mere "money substitute."
In actuality there are no real reserves. When a bank deposits reserves with the central bank, it only means their account at the Fed goes down on the screen.

Lotta people don't understand is that U.S. debt means others have to give U.S. money
To be exact, $21 trillion would have to be given to the U.S. government in order for U.S. debt to reach zero.
@_date: 2018-10-30 01:54:18
No, the public debt clock simply shows how many dollars exist.
The dollar exists in the following 3 forms: Cash, bonds, and bank accounts.
If you add those three up, you get the public debt.

Why would the U.S. need China to give it dollars? The fact is, USA has a dollar printer, while China doesn't.
As the Arabs say "He who doesn't have something, can't give it." This proverb teaches us that China doesn't supply America with dollars.
What actually happened is that China sent merchandise, and the U.S. already paid them with $1.2 trillion

Since the U.S. is monopoly issuer of the dollar, that is where Chinamen got all their dollars, including the ones they used to buy bonds.
So, there is really no debt to speak of.
I'm sure the Chinese were hoping to buy some U.S. products one day, but that was never explicitly guaranteed. Such as "If you ever bring $30,000 america promises to deliver you a Ford." No such contract was signed, so that is not the debt either.
@_date: 2018-10-30 03:41:07
OK So if China already has $3T then how is it "owed" to them?
Usually when you pay someone, the debt is cleared.
I will let you know the correct answer. The only reason this is called Debt, is that america has promised to accept dollars for tax purposes. This promise is the debt.

Here is how i used to refute bitcoin enthusiasts back in the day when i was young:
Imagine you buy btc cheap, and later sell for trillions. "Great," you think. "Now I can afford various niceties."
You call up a house builder and a mechanic to provide you with some lavish mansions and working cars.
"Sorry," they say. "We no longer work, because we realized we could just buy BTC and wait for Moon and Lambo."
So the guy that struck it big with bitcoin remains broke for eternity.

Regarding your statement that dollar cash is just as useless for personal enjoyment as bitcoin, you are right.
But weren't you people saying how Bitcoin was an improved version of the failed dollar? Now suddenly you claim they are pretty much the same.
The reason USD has value however, is that it pays U.S. taxes while bitcoin doesn't and never will.
That day-and-night difference means that USD is tremendously valuable while cryptos are worth exactly nothing.
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:03:05
There is another theory, and that is that such money never existed. Instead it was always issued by the government.

So you are saying Bitcoin is like Gold. But if i now proved to you that Bitcoin doesn't have the properties of Gold, you would switch to saying:
1. OK Bitcoin is completely unlike gold, but it's like the dollar.
So, let me say now that Gold is a real element that you can build a watch with, while bitcoin is not.

Well i am Annoyed that people ascribe value to cryptos when they have None.
So i like to debate this point in a serious fashion
Namely i don't see any direct usability of bitcoin, which means if i'm sitting at home trying to Enjoy a bitcoin by myself, how would that work.
Remember, enjoy it directly myself, not give it to others for something else.
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:13:09
Your conclusion would be hella wrong.
What is wrong with the following statement: "Gold costs $1000 but it can be damaged with a chisel. Meanwhile this post i made cannot be damaged with a chisel. Therefore this post is worth more than the earth's gold supply."
You made the same error, which is to assume bitcoin has any value to start with.

No, the debt is equal to money in circulation.

Well my theory is that people are coveting Bitcoin for 1 reason and 1 reason only.
And that is to resell it higher.
That however cannot be enduring, because in the long run people wish to pay As Little As Possible for something.
So, they will ask: Why should i pay 1 dollar for bitcoin, if i can only derive 0 dollars of enjoyment from one.
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:44:38
You can always buy 1 satoshi and thus become a trillionaire soon.
So everyone will always be rich with bitcoin, and thus everyone will always be poor since no one does anything.
Tldr bitcoin is worthless
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:44:14
1. Bitcoin doesn't have the valuable properties of gold (being a metal)
2. Bitcoin doesn't have the valuable properties of dollar (being something you pay taxes with)
So, where is bitcoin's value again? It doesn't exist.
The confusion started when the above 2 points were not understood.
@_date: 2018-10-28 22:00:46

As i predicted above, once i proved btc was unlike gold, you switched to saying btc was like USD.
This proves that pro-crypto arguments are all based on circularity and falsehood.
Now, the reason BTC is unlike USD, is that USD pays taxes.

So, let's assume for the sake of example that China owns $2 trillion of that debt.

@_date: 2018-10-30 06:31:06
You have to understand that dollars come from the government. They are not something that the government "needs to painstakingly obtain."
Rather they just print whatever number they want. And they are vested to do so by Society which allowed them to rule.
So the Fed can bail out anyone and anything. And thus the fiat system will continue to work like a charm.

Those things can Add More value to something that already has value; but can't create it from scratch.
I like to say that they are a Multiplier, but multipliers don't increase a zero.
Example: A Bugatti Veyron = $1 million; a rare Bugatti Veyron = $1 million x 2 = $2 million
A used toothpick of a homeless bum = $0; a limited edition used toothpick = $0 x 2 = $0
So here's the problem: Bitcoin = $0; Bitcoin with fantastic rarety and convenience = $0 x 900 = $0

There could be a computer File that has value, but it's of the following types

The logical mistake in Sentence 2 of your post, is that you immediately leapt into saying bitcoin was money.
With such arguing, you could prove anything. For example: "The reason I collect used toilet paper, is that it feels great to have such solid 24 carat gold in my collection."
Meaning, the argument consists of suddenly asserting that something is valuable, out of nowhere.

Yes but think about Why people are currently accepting it.
Because they reason: "Hey, isn't it sweet that I'm getting it for a mere $6400, but later on I will sell it to some loser for $1,000,000?"
If everyone is thinking that, it could go Very Sour once everyone switches from hopium to fearium.
Then it becomes : "I know I paid $6400, but I better sell for $6350 before it sinks to $6330."
And what is the rock bottom. Well if it fell 70% once, it can fall 70% again and 70% again, all the way to $00.00.
@_date: 2018-11-03 23:13:27
Yes but the utility of fiat is that it pays taxes.
@_date: 2018-11-04 08:37:47
You know when it would be a currency. If things were priced in it, in the following manner
"We sell ferraris for 50 bitcoins. Even if bitcoin becomes $5, we still sell Ferrari for 50 bitcoins. Because 50 bitcoins still equal 50 bitcoins."
But what happens in actuality is that prices move to accomodate the dollar. So if a home sold for 100 bitcoins last january, now it is priced at 300 bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-02 17:02:44

People usually want to pay As Little As Possible.
For example if I offered to sell you BTC for 7000, you would say: "I think I can get it cheaper."
If you have some kinda backing, e.g. 1 ounce of gold is guaranteed for the bearer, then it provides a cushion, because people are unlikely to sell below the backing.
However bitcoin's backing is $00.00
