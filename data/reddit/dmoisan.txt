You shouldn't be downvoted.  There's a kernel of truth in that: While Mt. Gox may have caused its own problems, I believe the Bitcoin Foundation also contributed by not having a complete specification.  
Instead, they (and everyone in Bitcoin's ecosystem) relied on "specification by implementation".  That has proved to be an impending disaster.
The IETF has long had a requirement that any new protocols it adopts must have at least two independent, separate implementations (two different clients, say, or two different servers, or a combination) before they are accepted.
The Bitcoin community will need to relearn what the larger open source community has had to learn:  There are no shortcuts.  They can't fall back on the excuse "It's written by volunteers, don't blame us for QC."  You might volunteer you and your buddies to build your friend's house, but you still have to meet codes and standards;  fire don't care about how noble you are.
For a start, Bitcoin can make it a mandatory goal to reach version 1.0b1 (from 0.8) with at least a **draft** reference specification.  It isn't going to magically solve problems any more than it does outside Bitcoin (cf. C language "undefined" behaviors) but it is absolutely essential for a protocol that is designed to subsume everyone else's currency.

Perhaps we've lost a little.  For years, filmmakers used to represent Black Friday with a stock film clip of a ticker machine just like that, walking itself off its table and smashing to the floor.
There's nothing that dramatic now.

Probably just a ham-handed attempt at demographic analysis by some marketing drone who doesn't know the net or that friction is a turnoff to conversation.  Yes, like just about most corporates.
