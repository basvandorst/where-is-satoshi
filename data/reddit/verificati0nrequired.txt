Thanks for that. What does it mean then if bitcoin is 'not an investment'?

A lot of customers received their pending withdrawals into JPY (not sure about other currencies) today however. Surely that means there's some kind of hope?  I suspect that there will be a fixed value for your bitcoins ($135 on trade-engine freeze), and whoever owns Gox subsequently may have the option of 'repaying you in full' at that value... ? This is speculation, but they then don't have to give you your market value bitcoins to take off the exchange?  Comments?

I don't believe those numbers from btckan.com are necessarily accurate.
When it says 'volume', I'm presuming that the smaller numbers are all 'Total USD', and that Huobi / Fxbtc / Chbtc are presenting their figures in RMB (current value is about 6:1 RMB : USD).
I've reasoned this from: 
1) Spot checking numbers of BITCOINS traded on mtgox / btce / fxbtc using btccharts.com in busy and quiet periods. If apples were being compared to apples, the volume numbers are WAAAAY out.
2) Okcoin was caught faking their numbers, so when someone tells me that out of the blue an unknown chinese exchange suddenly increases their volume to 3x that of MtGox simply with a bank account workaround that occurred less than 4 days ago, then there's something wrong here. 
3) Reading [Coindesk article about trade volume]( - the comment at the bottom by 'Sly' questioning the volumes quoted was an eye-opener.
Sooooooo - any thoughts?
