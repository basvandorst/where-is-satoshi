This is the thing that makes me question the lightning network honestly. How are people going to get new channels opened? I truly don't understand that aspect of the lightning network. Assuming Bitcoin succeeds at becoming a widely used currency, the transaction fees on layer one will be astronomical. Block space on the base layer would have a very high premium. I mean just look at 2017, fees hit $50 (400k TX/day). That already was very high for your average joe. In 10 years I wouldn't be surprised to see the tx fees on layer one to be $5k, Blocks would always be full. So how can one open and close a channel without paying astronomical fees (they can't)? This must mean that BTC nearly only exists on the lightning network in the future. Meaning no average joe would ever be closing channels, (in fact channels will rarely be closed), and no average joe would transact on the blockchain. I mean, sure channels will still be opened. there are companies and rich people that would do this at this point. And the same people would be the ones closing channels (Or they will purely transact on layer 1).  In the future, The only time someone will truly transact with BTC is if its through the lightning network, we will rarely use the blockchain. Maybe this truly is the second layer that will bring BTC into the mainstream. Like going from DOS to win 95. But this also means that Bitcoin will become some sort of a credit-hybrid financial system.

I agree with this. But this doesn't mean there can't be more than one cryptocurrency. Ethereum has the technological advantage. Bitcoin can be the reserve currency, digital gold, store of value, etc. Ethereum just has way more functionality and it is a mistake to overlook this. I overlooked it for the first year and a half of Ethereum existence. I see now that Ethereum is not going away, and with sharding it will only grow significantly.

You were the one being rude bro. Lol


Yeah... that's not a public key either... Facepalm.


Yes I did lol, its obvious it was a tx id. TXids are not even close to being in the same format as a private key. Besides, **it was linked on blockchain.info**. How do you link a private key on blockchain.info? It also looks nothing like a private key, its obvious what TXids are. Just take this as a learning experience and move on, we all start somewhere. Its ok dude, just don't be rude by calling other people stupid when you are the one thats in the wrong.

Tim Draper is clueless. He knows nothing, also $250k is wildly unrealistic. By 2022 the block reward will be 6.25. If Bitcoin were to hit 250k that means there there would be $9.3 million worth of BTC generated **per hour**. This works out to $220 million per day, or $82 billion per year. There would need to be $82 billion per year entering the Bitcoin market to sustain a price of $250k. Those numbers are comical

I thought this as well, but during a financial crisis like the one in 2008, the US dollar becomes worth less. Bitcoin is strongly correlated to the US dollar. It's likely Bitcoin would drop in value with the US dollar.

This is not an accurate line of thinking. You could argue Bitcoin started the Shitcoin legacy by being open source.  Just because shitcoins were created on Ethereum does not mean Ethereum will be only used to create shitcoins. It has way more functionality that Litecoin, Bitcoin, Monero, etc has. It is a platform that simply can do things these coins can't. You cannot argue against this. Ethereum has enterprise applications and this is a big deal for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:14:14


ETH is functioning and fully operational. EOS is highly experimental and very risky. EOS is more centralized than BTC and eth combined and they both are using entirely different consensus algorithms. Also, EOS was built off of Eth. 


I don't, but you were just talking about being an active engineer and software developer earlier. That is work. That tells me you aren't retired.


You can if you want to, im really not all that interested.

That's what makes it extra funny. I also firmly believe that is what fuels their hatred for Bitcoin even more. They were laughing at it and now they feel like total dipshits because they could have made a shit ton. So they laugh at it dropping now to reaffirm their position and reasoning for not buying it in the first place... Except the price is 10x higher now
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:02:35
I feel like some alien looking from the outside in. I always see you and buttcoiners say this shit. Saying that its hilariously dropping in price. Its funny as fuck for me though, because I bought at $200 - $300. So to hear you guys say its "hilariously dropping" down to $6000 is hilarious to me. Especially because you guys were saying the same shit when it dropped from $500 to $250.
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:02:00
Bitcoin would probably drop in value. The US dollar becomes worth less in a financial crisis and the US dollar and Bitcoin are highly correlated. I'm sure I'll be downvoted into obscurity since this isn't what most people on this subreddit want to hear.

Local Bitcoins always trade at a premium anyways. This is indicative of nothing. Bitcoin will head under $6k. It will likely head under $5.5k soon. We will probably see $3k - $5k. Every Bitcoin bubble has a large correction. This correction is only at 67% while they are usually 80%. This bubble is very similar to the 2014 bubble, so we will definitely be sinking lower. There is literally no reason for us not to.

That's not why im saying it won't work. It won't work for a number of reasons.

I don't lie. Its funny 2017 newbies are so quick to say this. They forget Bitcoin has been around for 8 years before 2017. I was the guy telling everyone to buy Bitcoin back then and no one listened to me. If you heard about Bitcoin years back from some dude, I was that type of dude.

Don't lose hope, each Bitcoin bubble has an average of an 80% correction. So far this is like a 67% correction. The only time to lose hope is if Bitcoin goes under $2k. That's when it could be the end of the game.  A lot of people here are waiting for Bitcoin to go to the moon, guys, it went to the moon. What do you think 2017 was? This is the first time Bitcoin has sustained a price over $1000. A lot of people forget this. Don't you guys think that $200 - $19,000 in three years is the moon? Would you agree? 
Even then, $1,000 - $19,000 in one year is still the moon. again, wouldn't you agree?
You will need to be holding for probably 2 years before we see any significant recovery.

Yeah, it really needs to be simplified for these guys. Bitcoin IMO will be restricted to the wealthy by using it as a store of value/alternative to gold. Using Bitcoin as a hedge.

A couple reasons... He has incredible self control to not access his wealth. Who has that self restraint? Other than that Satoshi was very libertarian. He himself having all those coins turned him into what he is against... Because of that I think he likely threw away the private keys. For anyone wondering Satoshi is very likely Nick Szabo. He's denied it (obviously) but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing to him and only him. Hal Finney likely didn't know satoshi was Nick

Ethereum isn't a currency, it's a platform. Ethereum will continue to be used by enterprises, the user base will continue to grow, and it will continue to rise in popularity/value. Metcalfes law applies. There is no point in arguing against this/denying it. Ethereum has more use cases, more utility, and more functionality.

I know this, I've been using it for 4.5 years out of those 9, thanks. Most people use it for speculation, not as a currency. You can't deny this, I don't.


You don't understand deflation. There are multiple types of deflation. Bitcoin is not deflationary in terms of the supply. There is always inflation with Bitcoins supply until 2140. Bitcoin's price rising is what makes it deflationary. Actually, that and I guess coins that are permanently lost is supply deflation. Think about it. Why would you want to buy something with Bitcoin today, when you could wait and buy more of that stuff for the same amount of Bitcoin? 


Yes, the money supply needs to flex for growing economies.

I agree we are going down further, new people in this community are always talking about Bitcoin and other crypto going to the moon. **guys, we have already gone to the moon**. a 38X increase in 2 years is the moon. The price is $6000, this is the first time the price has been **sustained** above $1000 ever. Many people here forget that. **I am a long term Bull as I have always been**, but the short term is very bearish. I hope everyone is prepared to pontentially lose another 25%-33%.

Its true that there are scams created with Eth, but arguing people will use Ethereum only for scams is the same thought process that the people who argue Bitcoin is only used for drugs use... Ethereum does have functionality that these other coins just don't. Smart contracts and dApps will and are being used in enterprise. Ethereum just has the technological capability that these other coins don't, this cannot be overlooked or denied. That is an advantage, especially if Sharding ever comes to fruition. Ethereum is a platform, cryptocurrencies come in many different shapes and Ethereum definitely offers something. It's not  on the market cap for no reason it could be overhyped to a degree, but it has always been  even before all the noobie hype came in.
Also, Ethereum has way more network activity than any of these other coins.

Well, lets use me as an example. I have been holding Bitcoin for four and a half years. I once spent an entire Bitcoin on a Wii U. As far as inflation is concerned, if I left that $300 in a bank account, it would be worth around $288 now. However, if I left it in Bitcoin it now would be worth $6000. I don't know if you are having a hard time picking, but its easy for me. I would pick the $6000 over the $288. But thats just me.
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:52:48
There are some good points. For example, usual Bitcoin bubbles see an 80% correction on everage. This correction is only 65%, much further down side potential. Another reason is interest in crypto is waning, people don't talk about it anymore and usually when they do, they do it as a joke. They just don't take it seriously. Another is currently the price is $6600. The block reward is 12.5. This means there is $495,000 worth of Bitcoin generated per hour, or $11 million dollars **a day**. Where is all this **new** money going to come from to buy up any coins miners sell? Even if they only sell half their coins thats still $5.5 million a day. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:58:28
How? What are you even trying to say? The Bitcoin community is in a sad state when people think a TX id **with a link to blockchain.info, which has no links for private keys**, is a private key.

Oh totally, I agree. But what I meant by Bitcoin not surviving I meant the market confidence. BTC will function and operate just fine at those prices, but if it dips that low it would be really off putting for new investors. The market confidence would basically be 0 and no one would trust putting their money back into Bitcoin. especially because of how much exposure it has received this last year.

You cannot deny Ethereum has more use cases then these other coins. It can do everything else they can do and more. I'm not sure why you don't see that. No point in arguing, its 100% fact. Because of the platform things can be developed on ethereum. This has a use case. You still also can't disregard the fact Vitalik is likely the most brilliant blockchain programmer out there besides Satoshi. Read some of his writings.


and 
Arguing Ethereum has no use you might as well be arguing Smart contracts have no use. None of these other coins can do complex smart contracts. Nick Szabo is also one of the most brilliant minds out there in cryptocurrency. He knows smart contracts are revolutionary. Nick Szabo should be listened to.


Really? Come on, **you could argue the exact same thing for Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash**. Why pay $6000 when you can get the same functionality for cheaper. Its the same argument, this makes no sense. This thinking cannot apply to networks. Ethereums network is signifcantly larger than ETCs. Again, Ethereum has more activity on its network than BTC, LTC, XMR combined.


It has always been  like I said. Well before 2017.

Yeah, as others have said its not unintuinive when you can use Satoshis as the denominations or even mBTC/bits. Also, Bitcoin can only be divided by up to 8 decimal points, not infinity decimal points. Also, the thousands of other coins have nothing to do with Bitcoins scarcitiy. Bitcoin itself is scarce. Thats like saying all the other precious metals make gold worth less because golds not scarce since there is so much silver. Doesn't really make sense.

I know this too, its obvious public knowledge. How can you have such a fundamental lack of knowledge when it comes to crypto if this was true? You talk like you don't understand shit. You can't even admit Ethereum is more technologically capable then Bitcoin when literally everyone in this space would admit it. You are clearly a 2017 noobie. You just state facts that people agree with yet you don't address any of my points. Seriously, re read this conversation. You haven't addressed all of my points. I address all of yours. Not sure if you have reading comprehension issues or are just plain stupid.


Close, Im an arrogant adult.


Yes I can lol. I used to be a Poloniex moderator. Too bad you must have held not very many coins, otherwise you too would be retired like me. You probably used Bitcoin once back in 2013 to buy something from silkroad and never held any coins. Please stop acting like Bitcoin has the same functionality as Ethereum. Its apples to oranges, everyone knows this.

Ethereum has a technological advantage over Bitcoin. period the end. Yet you keep going talking about shit im not even talking about. Stop dude, you are seriously looking dumb. 


 I agree no company will accept crypto, I was never arguing this?? We weren't even talking about this. I already know all companies that accept Bitcoin turn it into fiat. Again, why are you bringing this up? We weren't talking about this at all.


I don't care what experience you have. Your experience is essentially nullified when it comes to blockchain tech. This is a new sector of technology, your "experience" does not apply here. You know nothing about cryptocurrency, it's easy to tell. If you did you would not be arguing against ethereum. You were even implying Ethereum is a currency. LOL.

Agreed, but $230 - $5000 is a better return then $5000 - $20,000, you can't deny this. That is how I made the majority of my millions. I sold enough to retire though at $17k.

This is besides the point though, Sharding is a solution for on chain scaling. Ethereum still has more network activity, more functionality, and will continue to grow. Ethereum can simply do things Bitcoin cannot. And this is good.

 70% in 7 months? It's up 150% in the last one year. The last two years its up 800%. 70% in 7 months is childs play. K

The funny thing is, I remember being so depressed about the BTC price. It kept dropping over months, slowly. Bleeding out. I just wanted to sell everything and walk away from it all when the price was $230. But I decided to hold. It's things like this make me feel better.

It will drop under $6k definitely, it will drop under $5k likely, it will drop under $4k **maybe**. Will it drop under $2k? **Definitely not**

Oh. Sorry. Yeah this sub is toxic. Weird coincidence, my name is richard though. Is that you jeff?

OP, the repair shop stole your coins. There is no way around it, he got access to your private key and stole them. I don't think you will be able to prove this, there is no way you can get them back it sucks my friend, really does

I did sell some, but $230 - $5000 is where I made most of my $$$, that is where the big profit came from.
$5000 - $20000 is only a 400% gain. $230 - $5000 is a 2000% gain. That is the Big profit.

Sweet jesus, at least you guys confused the TX id for a private key. It would have been insane if you guys thought thats what his address was.
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:43:13
There was waaayyyyyyyyyy more FUD back when the price was $400 than there is today.

Wealth inequality? No, its wealth redistribution.

Then the market would quickly be worth trillions.

I was your age when I bought some of my first Bitcoin. Best decision i've ever made :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:01:25
Maybe, I do believe Bitcoin can be a store of value definitely. But there are a ton of industrial use cases for gold. That part of golds market cap Bitcoin will never be able to take. Who knows how much of golds market cap is because of industrial use cases.
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:42:29
That is very true, I agree... lets assume they only sell 25% of this. That is still $20 Billion+ per year, still an insane amount. **And this only takes into account Bitcoin. With all the other crypto currencies out there, there just isn't enough money to go around**.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:38:50
It won't drop to $1k or below. If it does then its done for good.

1. Million TPS
2. I'm not sure its quantifiable right now. I know its somewhere around 20 BTC or something, but I don't think we can see the transaction throughput. 
3. I don't think you can

You must have gotten in Bitcoin in 2017/2018.

Its just block 0, 1, 2, 3, etc for 10s of thousands of blocks. All the early blocks were sent to a different address each time and he has only moved the coins in one of those wallets years ago. If I recall he asked Hal to send him 20 coins and he sent 50+20 coins to Hal finney

I could see that, but Ethereum has way more technical advantages over these coins. Ethereum is a platform which is a big deal for enterprise. I like the extra utility and functionality Ethereum has that these other coins don't. While I never bought any of Eths ICO (used to be called IPO back then, hugely regret not buying. it was .0005 per Eth which was $0.25 at the time) It eventually grew on me. I thought it was a scam initially, but I do love it now. I too am against ICOs, premines and everything, But Eth has withstood the test of time and Vitalik is a very Brilliant person. He has possibly the deepest understanding of blockchain technology right now, other than Satoshi himself. Read some of the articles he's written on decentralization and other aspects of Blockchain. Its some really great stuff!

Are you insane??? Don't you realize that Bitcoin is for only holding and never touching? Don't you realize it is for getting rich quick? Everyone here on this subreddit thinks that Bitcoins only use case is getting rich quick.

I think it's fairly obvious Nick Szabo is Satoshi. There was no Satoshi "team". It was just Nick Szabo in on it. He received help from Hal and Laszlo early on, but Nick was developing Bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:32:21
Its a theory until we have definitive proof with a signed message from one of satoshi's keys. Besides, everything I've read is heavily reliant on craigs "leaked" (lol yeah right) emails and CSW is known for faking evidence. It's highly likely these emails are forged and faked, exactly like CSW did to fool gavin. Everything here alludes to the fact that there is one key, or a few private keys, that are held in this trust. This is not what Satoshi would have. There are thousands upon thousands, actually tens of thousands upon tens of thousands private keys that Satoshi holds. All 300,000/700,000 coins aren't held on one key, or even a few keys like the article states. CSW forged emails and had nothing to do with Bitcoin's creation. Maybe it was Kleiman, but definitely 100% Craig was not a part of Bitcoins inception. 
Again, most likely candidate is still Nick Szabo. Nick is the only person that has definitive evidence that he was actively developing Bitcoin (Bitgold) well before anyone else was. The idea of Bitgold was in Nicks head in the late 90s, and it got to a point where he finally began to develop and implement it in 2005. There is a timeline there, there is way more evidence that points towards Nick. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:29:21
What the fuck? No one here is mentioning the fact that Bitcoin was never $1000 in 2015? It was never really even close.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:54:55
I mean, I haven't read this article but I know about the CSW and Kleiman theory. I'll read the article when I am free but it's fairly obvious still that Nick and only Nick was Satoshi. Satoshi's and Nicks writing styles are identical, Satoshi sent an email with a vanity address and said it had his initials (NS not SN), and in Nick's post about Bitgold in 2005 he actively was starting to code Bitcoin. In 2006 he said he was using Hal Finney's rPOW in an attempt at implementing Bitgold. Then he goes back and retroactively changes the dates on his Bitgold articles after Bitcoin was launched. There are many other things as well. There is just way more evidence that point's towards Nick rather than CSW or Kleiman.
Not to mention Satoshi was a shoddy C++ programmer (As is nick). Also, Nick had a Freudian slip saying that he designed Bitcoin in a podcast. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:07:56
IMO, it's obvious CSW had nothing to do with Bitcoin and he is just a compulsive lier and also a pro conman. Satoshi was clearly Nick Szabo.

This is a correct statement.
