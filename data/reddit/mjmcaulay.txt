My manager and I actually joked about it right after the announcement because he knew I was passionate about Bitcoin.  Almost wish I could split it, fiat for my current obligations, Bitcoin for savings and discretionary spending.

I guess for now it feels like a simple way to acknowledge how far this amazing technology has come and how much the community has contributed to it's adoption. I know especially here it's nothing 'special' but it was a small bit of good news I thought was worth sharing.

Was very happily surprised when they announced this at the last all hands.   It's not on the site yet but they announced it via a press release.   As a side note, being in Seattle the company got into the spirit of the Superbowl this week and put a scavenger hunt site together to win a package for 2 to the Superbowl including flights and 4 night stay at a hotel.  You'll have to be in the Seattle area to play(as the game is visiting some of the sights in Seattle) but good luck to those who can:  
Edited to reflect it's actually a mobile site not an app.

Thanks for trying to offset them.  
Buying the ticket was super easy certainly no harder than any other online booking site.
  That's really a kind offer.  She's going down to see my family(hers are in Denmark). She has a great relationship with my folks and we haven't been down since our son was born(15 months ago) so there are family and old friends in Orange County clamoring to see the little charmer. I can't go due to some work responsibilities but I didn't think we could put it off any longer.  We also live in Seattle and the grey skies can become oppressive so she's hoping to get some sunshine in her eyes, it will be in Feb. so it will be either lovely or pouring rain :).

Despite me being unhappy about these stories, in general I've found ars stories to be some of the best sourced and written material in the fields of technology and science.  Every time there is a major story about some scientific breakthrough, an author from that field of science actually reads the paper to which the claims are associated.  Every other place I read is using secondary and sometimes tertiary sources.  So I would say that in general they do know their subject matter. Obviously I feel they missed the mark here but I'd hate to see a place that actually does the right thing to be put in the same category as others who are mostly news recyclers.

Cheapest flight we've purchased in years for that route (Seattle to Southern California) ~0.27 BTC.

I've really been disappointed with them as I generally find their coverage of topics to be excellent. Admittedly, I was skeptical for a long time but the more I read and understood the more I realized how powerful it was and so I purchased some back in April/May. Sometimes I wonder if in the tech industry we sometimes have an anti-bandwagon sentiment. That is to say by the time your neighbor has heard of a technology it's probably passe.

I hadn't seen this posted yet so apologies if this is redundant.  Came as this funny little peel open post card.

I'm probably going to regret asking this but at present I have about 22 downvotes for this thread.  Just really curious why someone downvote such an innocuous post.  Is it likely trolls or people who are tired of the "I bought x with bitcoin." posts?
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:50:00
Totally, and no worries :).  Hopefully that day will come sooner than any of us would guess.

Ok so I admit I was completely lazy and posted this after only casually browsing this subreddit.  I'm amazed people actually bothered taking the time to comment.

This was my first thought, followed shortly by tainted coins. Would be very strange if the cash in your wallet was suddenly rendered useless because the serial numbers were invalidated. It's one thing to say it's hard to use cash because the serial numbers were from a bank robbery or something. It's something else to say any transaction is blocked because they own the processing network.

This has been driving me a bit nuts.  They are going from a previously hard coded value to a setting with a default, so each miner can choose for themselves.  Really hate FUD crap like this.  How is this bad, or even a worse condition than before?

I know it's like whack a mole but when I've noticed them on threads I've started. I just keep reporting them until they disappear from the thread.  So I guess I'm saying, maybe each OP should take responsibility for reporting, particularly when a thread is just starting out.  Maybe we can prune enough bogus accounts that way to help.
@_date: 2013-05-07 03:48:21
This.  This was my exact chain of thoughts. Particularly the gag order, given the lack of communication on the subject.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:07:32
Just dropped them a line. Hopefully others here will do the same.  Gyft seems like a good middle ground for those companies who are worried about Bitcoin volatility but want to test the waters of this new economic tool.

I wanted to hear their official policy as I wanted to be sure they didn't have issues with accounts being used to buy and sell bitcoin.  I may follow up for clarification, but given the way they put it, I'm not sure I'd feel safe no matter what reassurances they would give me now.  If you're a bank that doesn't have an issue with bitcoin, you mention that when someone asks.

Just did an experiment with adding a 'legitimate' comment to one of my threads.  It seemed to 'kick in' the spam reporting I'd done and prevented them from coming back.

Just a thought, as the last mined coins will be awarded in 2140 presuming Bitcoin is still around, ie hasn't been replaced by the 10th iteration of crypto-currency, you'll probably be dead.  So cheer up :) and enjoy today.

Always encouraging to see the benefits of digital transactions playing out.

Apparently there are some other considerations that introduce an added cost, here's link describing it

Having grown up around a funeral home, I've heard this sentiment a lot.  Most people don't want a fuss for themselves but have a harder time doing the same for loved ones.  This highlights the reality of funerals.  Funerals are not for the dead but those they leave behind. To many it's a concrete way to say goodbye, for their own sense of closure.  Honestly, I'd say the kindest thing you can do as the one "leaving" is leave enough behind for a modest memorial service.

Using IBAN's is supported. Pretty straight forward.  Add withdrawal method on mtgox and give them your IBAN.  Will probably take a few days to verify then you are good.  Here's your banks page on IBAN:

I've sent a follow up for clarification. I just currently bank with Chase and have seen their general hostility here, not to mention their intent to make a centralized bitcoin of their own.  I'd like to find a solid alternative before it's too late.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:21:19
Follow up: after clarification I got the following reply:
Thank you for the added clarification.  First Tech will accept for deposit U.S. currency that is submitted and/or transferred through the EFT and/or ACH electronic channels.
So in the end much better than I thought and I jumped the gun.

If the USD was no longer the reserve currency for global trade.  All those printed dollars tied up in the global market suddenly being unleashed would cause inflation on the USD to go stratospheric.  Not a nice thought but probably the fastest way to a 100k Bitcoin.

 Seems like once a real comment is in the thread and you report the other it doesn't seem to keep coming back anymore.  I was suggesting on another thread OP should take responsibility for reporting early, and maybe adding a quick self comment to establish the thread to prevent the zombie spam from coming back.

Awesome news! With the prices up last night I bought a fair bit of Amazon gift cards, thanks for backdating!

Adding a comment to see if it kills the spam.  Just had another thread that once a legitimate comment showed up in the thread, the reporting of spam seemed to kick in. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:19:40
I guess the point I figured was up for discussion, is how will retailers react?  Will they try to lock customers into their escrow system, knowing that they will squeeze some extra profit out of it?  Or will there be enough market pressure to cause them to adopt the support of many escrow services and let the customer decide.  Because there are fundamental trust issues being resolved with escrows, I guess I was trying to think of how it might actually play out in a way that's far to both retailer and consumer.

Update: just noticed this message on their server:
Our MySQL server started to fail this night. We're migrating to postgres now, but this will take some time.

0.0005 is probably the most "normal" fee paid.  But really depending on the software/site you use it's up to you.  In essence your offering a bounty for the miners to process your transaction. Don't need it processed in a hurry?  Then you might dare to go lower than 0.0005.  Need the confirmations to go through quickly? Consider bumping it up a bit, maybe to 0.001.
