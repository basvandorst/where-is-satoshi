Last chance to purchase units at the IPO (Initial Public Offering) price, which is 0.0010 Bitcoins. Usually investors (in the stock exchange) like to purchase shares at IPO since they tend to be much cheaper.
They expect that as the company grows, their share price will rise as well. So purchasing during IPO, at its cheapest, then selling when the price is higher will yield higher profits.

Satoshi's email is listed in his original 9-page document introducing and explaining Bitcoins.
You could try to contact him? If he doesn't answer well then maybe he was assassinated! haha
Personally, I believe there is a government behind it, most likely with the aim of weakening the US dollar and decentralizing the power of the US dollar. Just a thought. Either way, doesn't change my perspective of Bitcoins! Still love it and will still promote it!
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:59:08
How do you deal with seiing assets in criminal assets as bitcoins?
Panelist: we do it as other assets and currencies. Civil forfeiture action. We seize websites and forfeit companies. There are challenges.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:53:58
Be sure to send them an email and telling them that! The only ways that a business will adopt bitcoins is if 1) Customers ask or 2) the owner is a bitcoin enthusiast!
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:07:16

The blockchain - The recorded transactions of all Bitcoins sent is confirmed as legitimate by multiple people on the Bitcoin network confirming that Yes, this is the way it happened. Ron gave Sally 5 Bitcoin at 12:49 PM
Well, you could say Ron gave George 5 Bitcoin at 12:48 PM and if you get enough people on the network to believe that it happened this way, suddenly Sally's 5 Bitcoin disappears, and George has them.
In order to convince the majority of people that Ron gave George the money, you'd need to be able to solve and process the blockchain faster than anyone else so you can falsify this information.
If you have 51% of the Bitcoin network's power, you can essentially tell people that Ron gave George the money, faster than the other 49% can say Ron gave Sally the money.
If you keep perpetuating your bad blockchain, you can make a blockchain longer than the real one that gets acknowledged by the majority of the network, eventually giving you the ability to falsify even more of it, as the majority of the network has no choice but to trust you.

Panelist: As soon as the cryptocurrency enters the "real" world, it should touch on regulations. As long as it's "under the water/in the internet" then not.
If there is an exchange between Bitcoin and fiat, it should be seen as an exchange between currencies.
Merchants accepting bitcoins should not require a license.

@_date: 2014-01-13 11:11:35
I've been using them for half a year now with zero problems! I actually enjoy their service! It saves me time and money from using the typical option of trading, i.e. banks.
People who complain that it is a scam, don't understand investing and think it's a "get rich quick" thing. So they don't think or invest strategically and lose all their invested funds..

@_date: 2014-01-16 12:13:38

Well the company already has shares issued. Just not publically traded (on havelock) until now. So the early investors, the owners, possibly employees, the holding company (which owns Neo&amp;Bee), all already have certain percentage of ownership of Neo &amp; Bee (representing by shares).
Let's take google as an example. When it was created created, the ownership was split between the 2 founders. Then they gave up a certain amount of ownership to the 2 Venture Capitalists who invested in them. When they went public (at the stock exchange), the owners and venture capitalists would be able to sell their shares at a much higher price than they bought/had it before going public.

Virtual office companies usually take a floor (or a few) in a strategic location, not a whole building.

Overstock: we have a fraud prevention department who screen the orders. If we think an order on your credit card is suspicious, we call them to confirm. We cancel approximately under 2% of the orders. Despite that, we lose 18 bases points a year.
The risk with that with bitcoins goes down significantly. We don't lose that much with bitcoin! We saw target have customer information hacked. The protection in cryptocurrency prevents that.

As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.
Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity. Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge. Cold storage coins were held offline and not within reach of the attacker. All other users will be directed to Flexcoin's "Terms of service" located at "Flexcoin.com/118.html" a document which was agreed on, upon signing up with Flexcoin.

Mining for Bitcoins at this point is useless if you are using a regular computer and looking to get bitcoins and sell them.
Now, there are big data centres running equipment to mine for bitcoins.
You could still run it on your computer but you want to consider the costs of running it (i.e electricity).
You can use Bitcoin QT as a wallet to hold your bitcoins, however.

@_date: 2014-02-19 18:01:52
What other bank do you plan on using?
All this just proves how much bitcoin is needed! If more places/people were accepting and operating in bitcoins, we wouldn't need to go through the banks (as much)

Panelist: We will see, this year, the banking systems implement their own digital currency but will prove a failure. It will be like a fake bitcoin, and won't survive.
Industries with something to lose from bitcoin will try to create something similar. No one will build on top of JP Morgan Chase's Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:09:09
Panelist: Currency that is centralized is more dangerous than not centralized. decentralised, no owner and no one can control it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 07:39:19
I'll try to keep it as simple as I can:
* The difficulty is insanely high! The reward is also lower now, at 25 bitcoins. 
* You "make money" by selling the Bitcoins you mined.
* You used to be able to mine with a simple computer but it is no longer possible (due to the increasing difficulty rate).
* To yield result, you will need to purchase actual mining equipment - which cost thousands of dollars.
* Even then, by the time you receive the equipment, the difficulty will be higher so estimated result wouldn't be as much as expected
* So it will take you even longer to break even and pay off the equipment/electricity costs before you can start actually making profit.
I tried my best to clarify and answer your questions in the simplest way! Let me know if you have any more questions! 
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:24:00

Annoy them. Ask to see their corporate policy in writing with any and all terms related to "bitcoin" highlighted. If they refuse, tell them that them sending it to you will be a lot quicker than you have to request an Access to Information on their documents.
Have fun! Also, future memo, avoid mentioning bitcoins in your description of your company. Just describe it, but without bitcoins. Like this:
* Bitcoin mining hardware: "Oh I'm in the computer hardware business"
* Bitcoin exchange service: "Oh I do currency exchange"
* Online bitcoin payment service: "Oh I facilitate payment processes"
Those are a few examples! Get creative with it! If you'd like to let me know what kind of business it is, I could help come up with a creative description :) haha Good luck!
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:53:32

Best way to convince someone to use/enjoy bitcoin is by giving them some.
Whenever you are discussing it with someone, offer to send them a couple dollars worth of bitcoin. As soon as they see it in their wallet (show them how to get one), it's almost magical how they become exciting about it!
Try it for yourselves and see :)
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:49:14
Is it really anonymous? Since every single transaction can be traced and seen.. How are to actually take it to the next level and identifying the person behind it.
Panelist: Having an IP address and located it is completely different. It's obvious but i'm not a super technical guy.
There was a lot of speculation about how we penetrated the silk road on the tor network. I will let them continue to speculate. Tumblrs are set up automatically for payment. As you know, you can achieve effective and enough anonymity by putting up enough barriers.

"Question is: can we get somewhere in between, VERY comfortable, between preventing money laundering and innovation"
Panelist: nobody wants money laundering. 1-2 years ago, it was like the wild west, no one likes that. But there should be common ground. By giving entrepreneurs the safe harbour, we can get there without super expensive regulatory process
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:37:32
So it starts! :) I will transcribe the actual discussion and not what is read from the testimonies.
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:34:57
I've been using this website (for the stock market) for a few months now and I was quite happy when they finally announced that they will allow for the purchase of Bitcoin's value (Beta mode). This means when the price of Bitcoin goes up, you make money and if it goes down you lose money.
The reason why I was/am truly excited about it is because this website has over 2.75 million users in more than 140 countries. 
Imagine all the exposure Bitcoin is getting!
What I ask is that you join the discussion on the Bitcoin thread on that website. Lots people have lots questions about Bitcoin in general! If there are more people helping out and contributing to the discussion, we can get more people informed and hopefully have them join the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:23:20
Huge thing if bitcoin can push international wire transfer fees from 7-8% to 1%. Can that happen?
Panelist: already happening.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:58:02
Great idea applying for MSB license. Shows great initiative to the community as well as to FINTRAC/Government.S hould anything, God forbid, happen, it will show that you at least tried! 
Thanks for the update! Which bank do you use as primary?
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:39:00
You felt the risk is almost non-existent? 
overstock: we spoke to many wallets, they were backed by great investors. i think it's easy to use
Coinbase: liquidity is not an issue with the everyday consumer. It's a daily cash out thing
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:52:45
I'm sorry but I was just reading over the AMA and I can truly say that I'm almost fed up with certain groups within our community.
* 1) we can't seem to let go and move on from Mt.Gox. Even though they are dead we still continue to have all that drama fill up our front page.
* 2) We had a great opportunity to ask Ben Lawsky great questions but people kept nagging (at every question) "but HSBC this, HSBC that"
SERIOUSLY?! People need to grow up!
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:19:07
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:31:18
"Anyone who has been involved in Bitcoin for longer than a year knows that:
1) Mt Gox has a history of technical failures, including a DDoS attack in April of last year when they were the only exchange around which crashed the price. People then were shouting the death of bitcoin, and yet here we are a year later with massive growth in bitcoin startups and interest in general. I, myself, used Mt Gox to buy my first bitcoin but (not having my head in the sand) realized that fiat withdrawals were nearly impossible and moved my bitcoin elsewhere. Which brings me to my second point;
2) If you keep any large amount of bitcoin anywhere you don't control the private keys, you are taking a huge risk (didn't we learn this when people's online wallets were hacked? Or with Silk Road V1.0?). Some people take on this risk because laziness, greed, or a complete lack of homework into what they are investing. None of these are good enough reasons to have my sympathy. And finally;
3) The fundamentals haven't changed. Mt Gox IS NOT BITCOIN. Mt Gox might go away, but Bitcoin will not and if people are worried about what the rest of the world incorrectly perceives it is only because they are concerned about the price and most likely have NOT done their homework and have most likely invested more than they can afford to lose.
I'm sorry for your speculative losses, but crying about it on Reddit isn't going to garner my support when you clearly have no idea what you're doing."
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:51:43
Completely inconsiderate to startups and small businesses who don't have that massive initial investments!
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:00:33
For all we know, this could a publicity stunt for the atm(s).
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:39:39
No problem. Just remember you do want to support the bitcoin community and help it grow (which will be more profitable for you eventually). The whole point is to get people to actively use Bitcoins.
So I would recommend, should you decide to start mining, is cash out what you need to cover your costs/expenses and keep the rest in Bitcoins. Think of it as a long term investment. it's worth around $900 now but could maybe be double that in a few months.
Also, use Bitcoins when you can. If you are making large purchases, use that to your advantage to get the payment receiver to accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:00:50
It's quicker for me to do it this way.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:29:39

At the end of the day, our goal is to *encourage* people to point their miners away and not *force* them to.
We are aiming to decentralize the mining pools without controlling/centralizing it.. it's just a little awkward and seems quite difficult to achieve the more I think about it.
Am I making any sense?

They are not controlling Bitcoin. They are (planning on) putting regulation to ensure illegal actions are prevented. Terrorists are financed by laundered money. Someone in shitstan can turn his $50,000 into bitcoins transfer them here and some shitstanian guy can withdraw them and use them to purchase whatever. That is the reality of our world, unfortunately. That is why banks/governments limit the amount you can withdraw from ATMs in general as well as require you to get identified to use their services. Just like a currency exchange.
Bitcoin will always remain decentralized no matter how much regulation. It is just a matter of how its services can function. And right now, it requires that you are identified to use the service, whether online or in person at an ATM.
To tell them that not to be making ATMs...well try to remember how they pioneered and made available the first physical Bitcoin exchange where you can exchange using cash within minutes... Vancouver reached $1000000 in transaction volume within their first month and 70% of the users were new bitcoiners... It doesn't get any more mainstream than that! Robocoin have contributed to bitcoins getting into the physical world and pushed it even more mainstream. It was all over the news for months!

I posted this on the other article about the reporter's 
Whether or not this is the actual Satoshi Nakamoto, we need to consider a few things:
* This person's life is now in danger.
* This person is now at risk of theft/kidnapping/ransom.
* This person is probably going to be heavily monitored by the government. Possible taken in for question?
* All thefts (i.e Gox) any criminal activity or anything bad that happened around Bitcoin will be pinned on him by less informed people
* He will be harassed by media
* All the above apply to his family members &amp; extended family &amp; close friends.
All this to pin someone who MIGHT be the creator of Bitcoin. Like that matters? Who cares about who made it?! The attention should be at the actual work, i.e the Bitcoin protocol!

@_date: 2014-03-06 13:18:14
Whether or not this is the actual Satoshi Nakamoto, we need to consider a few things:
* This person's life is now in danger.
* This person is now at risk of theft/kidnapping/ransom.
* This person is probably going to be heavily monitored by the government. Possible taken in for question?
* All thefts (i.e Gox) any criminal activity or anything bad that happened around Bitcoin will be pinned on him by less informed people
* He will be harassed by media
* All the above apply to his family members &amp; extended family &amp; close friends.
All this to pin someone who MIGHT be the creator of Bitcoin. Like that matters? Who cares about who made it?! The attention should be at the actual work, i.e the Bitcoin protocol!

Thank you! I appreciate that

Pointed at recent arrests, law enforcement are keeping up, nothing to worry.
Panelist: Virtual currency is a new phenomenon. These arrests doesn't prove it is not a problem. There were hundreds of people using silkroad and liberty reserve and most have successfully remained anonymous.

I'm glad the humour is back within the Bitcoin community on reddit!
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:35:28


how much is that in USD/XBT?
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:11:25
Oh come on! I wanted to keep seeing it just to see MtGox crash!
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:48:45
It's not a scam. I've been using eToro for over a year now with NO problems what so ever.
As for launching public trading in Bitcoin, it was BETA! They were testing it out and we all knew it as it cleared said "BETA" on the logo. A couple weeks later, they sent out an email to their 3+ million users informing them about Bitcoin.
Just because people think the stock exchange is a get rich quick thing and they fail, doesn't mean the site is a scam!
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:57:52
It's the price you pay for convenience. The costs and upkeep of an atm is not cheap 
@_date: 2014-01-12 09:07:35
Wet Tshirts it is! haha
Do you think indigogo or kickstarter will all for that? I like the idea of paying back those who donated.
Bitcoiniancs paid 20k for their atm machine. They ordered it from a company in California.
There doesn't seem to be an active montreal community though (at least not on reddit)
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:44:19
When it comes to virtual currencies, as prosecutors, can you compare it to prepaid cell phones used to cover anonymity? Is there a qualitative difference?
Panel: Yes, we see digital currencies becoming part of the mainstream market. That means if people misuse this medium for criminal purposes, if there is not adequate regulations to allow regulators to know who is behind the operation, it is opening a big door to financial transaction from around the world to commit crimes. Digital currency is almost strategic to cover identity unlike the prepaid phone which is simply to cover identity for communication

Speculation is that Blockchain.info bought mt.gox. There is a bigger announcement by Blockchain at 7am ET (in 2 hours and 15 minutes)
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:24:23
They are on Eastern time so it's still 6am. Give them 2 hours or 3 hours max before beginning to freak out ! haha
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:36:01
This service is actually the same as buying shares of a company from your bank. You actually buy ownership from "Apple, Netflix etc". You receive dividends.
With Bitcoin, that's not the case, you're right. But it is exposure, because if you read into the discussion going on, you will see what is going and the amount of curiosity and interest.

Trying to figure out which category I fall into..
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:03:51
**UPDATE** : eToro.com switches to Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:19:11
Panelist: Predictable who wants bitcoin to suceed and who doesn't. but we all believe there is a better world with it. when banks have 3% fees, their solution...they don't have one
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:11:19
no problem :)
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:40:37
Atms charge a 5% fee, which is then split with the manufacturer. It's not cheap to operate one of these. It's not as simple as just putting it in a corner and make money.
There's licensing to operate, rent, electricity, data consumption, salary, money logistic services etc.. All of which cost something.
5% to be able to buy and sell bitcoins within seconds and be able to put it cash or withdraw cash...that's great! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:59:19
They are not getting scared away by stuff like *this*, they are getting scared away from bitcoins! It's not about hiding things..
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:46:07
Panelist: Crypto-currencies are not just currencies, commodities or deeds etc... it's all of the above. It should have its own category
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:40:26
I've been using eToro for over 6 months now. The reason people complain is because they think it is a "get rich quick" but just like any investment, it's long term!
I've had no problem putting in funds or withdrawing.

@_date: 2014-01-12 05:45:11
Thank you for this! I was going to get to it but I was at work when I found this in the newspaper and submitted it on here! :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:52:23
Great job with that! 
Bitpay seems more popular and I think offers the cheapest rates (can someone confirm this?).
BitPremier is great! He should list Bitcoin on his site/social media as a form of payment.
He should consider offering some kind of discount to those paying in Bitcoins (since he will be saving a lot more on transaction fees). This will generate more traffic.
Also, should he agree, list his company with the link on here and mention how much of a discount he is offering. That should create a buzz!
Hope I helped! 
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:43:56
I thought you would just take off with it haha About how much is needed to create something like that?
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:32:49
Good point. That's is why they are desperately trying to make whatever amount they can to make up for it?
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:25:13

" the official **reportedly** wrote in an email.
The official from the Department of Finance, **who was not named** in the article"
Just another rumour..*yawn*..truth is we are and will continue to be a Bitcoin haven! That's just the Canadian way! As well as the amount of taxes we will be paying from Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:02:16
long run! if they are invest over 1-2 year time span!
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:15:14
how is 1 = 100%? 
50% +1 is simple majority
so let's say our figure is 4000. 50% +1 of that is 2001
50% of 4000 = 2000
2000 + 1 = 2001
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:17:15
I'm curious about the revenue stream.. Is there any?

it's essentially like getting a car delivered to you. They won't actually drive the car to get it to you.
It's like this:

@_date: 2014-03-29 17:29:08
I like that
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:58:05
Panelist: keep in mind we are still really early into this cryptocurrencies. we are seeing all kinds of tools coming out into the market, like an atm machine. you dont need a bank, you can just go up to it and put your cash in and get bitcoins

You can send Bitcoins via text message. Don't forget ;)
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:09:35
Well simply put. By Mt.Gox blocking BITCOIN withdrawals but not FIAT (USD, CHY, CAD...), people panicked (understandable) and started to sell their bitcoins to withdraw in FIAT.
By having so many people selling and not buying (especially from the same exchange), it causes the price to drop (since people are willing to sell at a lower price to save what they can.
Over that, Mt.Gox is not any exchange, it has been among the most popular (if not the most popular) online exchange.
Russia's news has little affect since vast majority of Bitcoins users/miners/traders/investors are not Russian...even then, it's not like it would make that much of a difference.
Hope I explained it enough! :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 09:27:09
I JUST set up a Montreal-Bitcoin subreddit! :D spread the word ;)
Let's discuss there!
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:09:07
How much would it generally cost?

@_date: 2014-01-16 16:18:30
Well they won't be for long... I believe there will be a massive liquidation of BFL.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:04:04
Should we set up a crowdfunding for an exchange?
We don't necessarily need to make it US-based, I'm in Canada and we can operate it from here, all while offering the services to US clients. 
It could somewhat be a decentralized exchange where we will only charge transaction fees that will be just enough to keep the exchange in operation.
What do you think?
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:03:35
I believe so. So I guess 50%+1 then
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:30:57
"Entrepreneurs rather not report that they are operating in the state with fears that they will be shut down. There should be a safe harbor for them"

This happened in November. A couple weeks before the launch/announcement of the Bitcoin ATM. He couldn't have done all that in 2 weeks.
Slander? lol right like what he's doing?
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:03:08
Or it could be that they are cutting down on costs? Which is terrible news..
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:08:13
Front-end? Back-end? both? 
I have a couple projects lined up. Depending on your skills, we could discuss potential contract or full-time employment if you are interested? PM me.

Anyone else other than me not panicking and actually buying? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:35:52
How is this working out, in regards to Chinese government's stance on bitcoins? Didn't they ban exchanges?
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:45:38
No problem! It's hard not to just transcribe the BS they are saying haha I'm trying to be selective
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:35:14
That's awesome! I notice you are Montreal-based!
Check out and post there too ;)
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:20:49

great sticker but what is up with the background of the blog/website?
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:55:06
This usually happens. Think of Twitter and Facebook (and countless of others). That is why with any IPO, let those with shares already cash out, the price goes down THEN buy.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:02:26
Honestly, not really haha but it is your blog and of course, your choice!
@_date: 2014-01-23 14:12:04
 is doing well. Check them out. Also, there's a Canadian Bitcoin subreddit and if you are in Montreal, @_date: 2014-01-29 16:19:46
I have some free time so I thought I'd contribute! :)
My transcription of the previous panels are roaming around somewhere on Reddit haha at the end of the day, I'll compile them all into one post!
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:32:31
How did I miss this?! I just watched that episode last night!

confirmed! Btw, if you are in/near montreal, check out the Montreal Bitcoin subreddit: 
We are about to hit 100 subscribers!

Great work CoinKite! Keep it up!
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:16:50
"he offered to exchange their money, by hand"
So if we was reported, he would be arrested and fined for operating without a license. 
These fees (which are 5% and also split between the operator and manufacturer) cover the costs around the bitcoin ATM: rent, electricity, data consumption, LICENSING  and etc..
so really, 5% to be able to withdraw in CASH in under a minute..that's nothing for this service.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:29:37
The panelist made a good point by stating how time sensitive these services are.
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:54:36
So go encourage people on the eToro Bitcoin discussion to go buy actual bitcoins..
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:41:34
I would disagree with this. A lot of people are registering to reddit just to get active on r/bitcoin. I registered a while ago and never cared for it until I got curious about bitcoin. They should be able to post/ask questions freely
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:10:51
They are on break. They return in 20 minutes!
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:23:41
What kind of volume do you have on BTCTrip?
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:12:36
Nope. You just were able to buy units that would be eligible to receive dividends.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:20:20
To discuss the live stream: 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:47:10
advertising? I have no gain from advertising.. Do you see a referral link?
I'm simply saying to read the thread and contribute to the discussion and make people more aware of what it is. I'm not telling you to go trade or whatever.

Sammy, as a Christian as well, I fail to see the relation of the mark of the devil to bitcoins/bitcoin atms.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:22:10
Well when I bought them they weren't worth much. Not that long later, they were enough to educate me and give me a place to stay while studying for a year.
Seems like a great investment actually.
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:25:41
I wish we would have been able to see them work live! They should've broadcasted it!
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:13:37
What if, hypothetically, we have NO pools at all?
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:11:18
I did say I was transcribing the MAIN points. Or what I believe are the main points. I am doing this out of my own volunteer time. I'm not paid by anyone. You have the option of doing the same if you wish, care or weren't too lazy. Reddit gives you that freedom.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:32:12
This is just crazy 
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:03:33
Panelist: lots of investment into bitcoin atms and exchanges. once they get them, people want to spend them so more and more merchants are accepting them
It's a network effect. Merchants have low fees, no chargebacks. Win-win situation.

Since it's so important to you:

"Malla manor traces its history back to 1443, when it is first recorded in written sources. During that time, there was a small castle at the site. Around 1620, the estate became the property of Swedish field marshal Gustav Horn. In 1651-1654, he commissioned architect Zakarias Hoffmann to erect a new manor house on the site. The house burnt down during the Great Northern War, and the current building received its appearance in the 1880s."

So you suggest that I take a loan out instead of actually working to pay for it now?
So it is somehow better, in your opinion, to accumulate about $50,000 in debt and then have to pay that off WITH interest to the bank as soon as a graduate..
How is that a solution?

What about the other banks? Can any Bitcoin-related company inform us of their experience with the others:
* TD
* ScotiaBank
* Desjardins
* RBC
* CIBC
* Laurentian

Where are you located in Canada?
Also note that there is a Bitcoin Canada subreddit as well as a Bitcoin Montreal subreddit Both would be able to give you better advice considering that they are Canadians involved in Bitcoins!

we're not talking about fractions.. in that case 1/1 would be 100% but we are talking about 1 as a single whole number value.
so 50% is half of the number.
1 is just an addition to that.

Panelist: IRS looking at it and struggling with categorizing it. It's a difficult issue.
Valuation issue, is it an investment or a currency? There will probably be a few more tax issues before we can finish.
Like a stockbroker, you have to claim how much you buy and sell. It's up to the person to also self report their gains and losses

One is license, the other isn't. One is compliant, the other isn't. One has a pretty thorough security system (facial recognition, biometric palm scanner and government ID scanner), the other doesn't.
That's the difference.

Is there more info about this? I can't seem to find anything online.
How much was it bought for? what was its use before?

That is according to the Financial Institutions Act. Cointrader.net is not a financial institution or financial service, especially since Canada declared bitcoin a commodity and not a currency. 
SO technically, the exchange could be equivalent to buy/selling water bottles for all they care.
Either way, it's a complete grey zone here in Canada.
You could always ask them:

Hmm I would ask if he owns any Bitcoins and if not, I'd ask him to create a wallet so I can send him some.
Best way to convince people to like/use bitcoins if to give them some :)
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:20:23
Yes you sell bitcoins for money or even better, by purchasing stuff using Bitcoins (supports and helps the community grow).
There are many exchange services online to sell your bitcoins. You can then withdraw the funds to your bank account.
You can meet up someone in person to sell (there are services that connect people locally) and you can get your cash.
Depending on where you live, there could be a Bitcoin ATM where you can sell your bitcoins and get cash. However, there are only about 8-9 Bitcoin ATMs in the world.

For those attempting to boycott The Salvation Army, you should remember they are a charity organization and not a business. 
That means by boycotting them, you are helping in reducing the help they can get for those really in need. Many of whom are LGBT members.
Just keep that in mind. They have the right to their opinion and views. They do INCREDIBLE work, indiscriminately!
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:35:22
Realize you are attempting to boycott a charity organization and not a business. 
The results are reduced space, food and general support for those most in need. Which includes LGBT members..

No blood banks take blood from those who participate in homosexual sex. There is a whole list of restrictions. Which I fall under because I lived in a country that could have been exposed to some kind of dangerous thing.. 
Doesn't mean I call foul and claim discrimination.
The reason blood is refused from them are for the reasons of these statistics:

Well considering how many people the SA reaches out to (currently the 2nd largest charity in the states, number 1 on a domestic level)..  the people in need will still be the first victims.

There's more details at the link but the bitcoins will be sold (at whichever value it is worth at the date set).
Current date is the 21st of each month. But more days have been added to this month leading up to Christmas. That way we can get the donations to the Charities.

I read this article and it had me wondering: Did anyone make a bitcoin donation to the Salvation Army kettle (or any other organization)? 
How did people react? Was it positive/negative?
Share your story! Personally, I would love to see charities full out and directly accept Bitcoins!

Many people were wondering how they could donate bitcoins to charities. I thought I could help somehow.
I have created a wallet for anyone interested in donating bitcoins to send to. 
The address is: 18ceDkSP5YFEDvqRXfBAxeiZNtmF6fuFYu
All donations will be made in the name of "Bitcoin for Charity" with the aim of charities eventually recognizing and accepting Bitcoins directly, in the future.
I will be keeping everyone updated through here:
I will also periodically take screenshots and upload them on the above link so everyone can see how much has been donated.
All donations received will be equally divided among the suggested charities. Each donation made, earns the person a right to suggest a charity to be added to the list of receivers.
100% of the bitcoins collected will be donated. 
Please contribute any ideas or suggestions on how we can improve this!
Happy Bitcoining!

exactly my thoughts! They save thoughts from suicide/alcoholism/drug addiction and so on. Yes they are a Christian organization and allign their views with Christian beliefs (as they have the right to), but many of the people that receive their help are homosexual, there are many volunteers who are homosexual and a few employees (they rarely get hired help since they are a charity) are homosexual.
I've met and spoken with many (homosexuals) who have gotten help AND volunteers with them. They said they knew that they were gay and never experienced any form of discrimination or abuse! Most go back every year around Christmas and a few of them help all year round.

perfect! Thank you! Would you be able to deposit the bitcoins into the bank account directly as fiat? Or would you need to go through something like coinbase first?
