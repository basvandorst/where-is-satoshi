That's not actually true. No matter how good of a hacker you are there is always the possibility of getting caught. Given the amount of funds involved, a deal won't be so bad. That is assuming there is a hacker in the first place and this whole fiasco isn't some kind of scheme by Bitfinex to cover up trading losses from using customer funds and/or losses from naked shorting. Zane is only the PR guy so he may not even be aware of what is really taking place on the technical/financial side. /no offense Zane.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:58:22
Maybe the hacker had big shorts on other exchanges and did the theft to cause a big drop. Maybe he will just simply refund the coins to Bitfinex now that he made plenty of legit loot. */end wishful thinking*

BFX Token Terms:
As you may know, certain property was stolen from iFinex Inc. and from BFXNA Inc. (collectively, the "Bitfinex Group") on August 2, 2016 (the "Losses"). Since then, the Bitfinex Group has been engaged in concerted efforts to stop the theft; investigate the security breach; secure all property within the Bitfinex.com platform; and co-ordinate with international law enforcement to identify the guilty parties, trace the property, and make recovery efforts for the benefit of our customers.
The Losses have been allocated ratably among Bitfinex Group customers with Bitfinex custody accounts in an effort to as closely as possible mirror what the Bitfinex Group considers would happen if it were placed into liquidation and its property distributed to its creditors. A pro rata share of the Losses is reflected in your account balance. In an effort to address your portion of the Losses, the Bitfinex Group is committing to deploy its efforts to make you whole to the extent of the full amount of your pro rata portion of the Losses.
To demonstrate this commitment, the Bitfinex Group is crediting to your account a token evidencing a limited-recourse, contingent obligation of the Bitfinex Group. The token is a notional credit, is dependent on the Bitfinex Group’s recovery of Losses, and is subordinated to any claims against the Bitfinex Group not related to the Losses. Recovery may include any of the following: recovery of stolen property; funds raised in one or more financings; and available cash from ongoing operations. The token has been issued to you without reduction of or other release or waiver of any claims you may have against the Bitfinex Group. Similarly, the Bitfinex Group has not waived any claims or defences it may have under the Terms of Use or otherwise should you choose to assert any claims independent of the token. The obligation evidenced by the token bears no interest and is not entitled to dividends, distributions, or other income amounts of any kind. The token is intended to be redeemed to the extent of its ratable share of the recoveries and may in any event at any time be redeemed by the Bitfinex Group at the Bitfinex Group’s sole option for its face value less the amount of any prior redemptions.
The token and your rights pursuant thereto may not be assigned except with notice to, and the prior consent of, the Bitfinex Group, on terms to be determined by the Bitfinex Group. Additional information about requirements for BFX token transfers.

Zane, why not hold off on the token trading till all the details are released? Why rush this?
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:26:46
I can't see any reason why mentioning the names of the agencies will somehow compromise/impede the investigation. Zane is the PR guy, he might not know what the CEO and higher ups are doing behind the scenes. How do we even know there is an actual investigation and that this isn't some kind of stalling tactic while these guys are preparing to make a run for it?

Yep, I remember the Poloniex hack and they came back stronger than ever. Bitfinex still has options. Zane has been fairly transparent so far, just like Poloniex at the time, so there are many parallels here.

This is what would happen in a bankruptcy court proceeding anyways!! Except in court, the lawyers would eat up a lot of fees and the process may take years and would be very complicated due to all kinds jurisdictional issues and murky laws related to digital currencies. This could be a legal nightmare and I think the resolution being proposed by Bitfinex is the fastest route to everyone getting access to funds in a timely manner. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:09:01
Zane, can you tell us which authorities are involved in the investigation at the present time?

@_date: 2016-08-05 14:28:48
The solution here is a class action against BitGo and their insurance company, which I'm sure coming soon.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:40:09
I'm assuming you have no money in Bitfinex. Only someone who has no skin in this game would say something so stupid.

Glass half empty kind of guy, eh?
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:04:59
I think a class action against BitGo might be much more successful. They are in the US and could be liable, regardless of the fact that Bitfinex supposedly did not have insurance. They fact that customer money was held at BitGo, along with their limits being circumvented, may be sufficient in court. We still don't know the exact nature of the breach so it may be premature to make any legal maneuvers just yet. Just saying.

Given the staggering size of the theft I would say 36% isn't that bad, I honestly thought it would be much higher.

@_date: 2016-08-08 23:15:12
This is a good idea, otherwise who is gonna buy these BFX tokens?? In order for there to be demand in the market investors need to have a reason to buy. Otherwise it's a scam.
The other idea would to be have the holders of the tokens getting a portion of the Bitfinex trading commissions.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:26:08
Everyone who accepts these coins is going to be open to prosecution. Reddit is most likely going to be subpoenaed over the next few days/weeks.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:42:39
Maybe Bitfinex cash reserves?

How are people gonna get their money out if what you say is true? Sounds like FUD!
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:05:55
This is what I am suspecting as well. Zane has not mentioned what authorities are involved.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:35:15
This hack, along with the DAO theft, could be state-sponsored. I wonder if anyone has thought about that?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:27:31
I think they will likely raise money and investment from outside sources, most Bitfinex clients will prob be relieved with a 36% haircut, I had already accepted the fact that I would never see anything ever again, so 36% sounds pretty good right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:09:09
Is the background a projection or is that the actual view from Keizer's studio?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:47:45
Let's hope that is the case. Statements from Zane seem to suggest that Bitfinex is planing to reopen, so I assume that the theft isn't lethal. 
I think if Bitfinex was completely wiped out we would not be getting so much communication from them. It would all be through legal counsel at that point.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:37:54
Probably trying to cause more panic and drop the btc price some more.

@_date: 2016-08-02 18:20:55
They only keep a portion of funds in the hot wallets and the rest of the accounts are supposedly secured by bitgo's multi-sig wallets, so this theft should not be too big. I hope!

If Bitfinex goes the way of Mt.Gox due to Tether, the regulatory clamp down that will follow will be so vicious that bitcoin may never recover. Don't think that just because bitcoin recovered after Mt.Gox that we'll have a repeat with a Bitfinex implosion. 
Second of all, most major altcoin exchanges use Tether, which means the financial damage will be widespread across the ecosystem, with multiple exchange failures. The damage to the entire cryptocurrency economy can't be overstated!! 
Have you even checked the Tether richlist to see where a large portion of Tether are held?

Satoshi's design assumed you would have a decentralized community of miners using their CPUs to mine. That is why he said the longest chain is the most valid one as it would represent the vote of the majority.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:01:54
Nope, "specialists with server farms" refers to servers to store the large blockchain!! Satoshi included that paragraph because he foresaw that the blockchain would eventually get so large that you would need server with sufficient HD space to store the whole thing. 
Satsohi is NOT referring to ASICs and massive mining farms, and you know it!
You know how I know that?? Because centralizing the mining power undermines the whole point of a "decentralized digital currency" and Satoshi specifically designed the system to make it 1 CPU = 1 VOTE. But of course, that concept flew out the window with the manufacturing of the first ASICs. 
That is the true *Nakamoto consensus*! Not dictators like Jihan Wu with these grotesque mining farms and monopolized ASIC manufacturing. The bitcoin mining monopoly China is the exact opposite of Satoshi's design!!

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:50:50
There are currently 53k unconfirmed transactions in the mempool and a block is mined every 15 minutes on average (versus the standard 10 minute blocktime) as many miners have switched to mining bitcoin cash for the time being.  
The transaction backlog has been high since the last difficulty adjustment on Oct. 26:
Oct 26 2017 hashrate: 10,399,832,230 GH/s
Nov 6 2017 hashrate: 6,618,329,100 GH/s
Big drop in hashrate since Oct 26!! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:32:55
The mempool is now over 75k and rising. I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but I think its safe to say Segwit alone is not enough.
LN won't be here for another 1-2 years probably, so I don't see how people will continue to pay these ridiculous fees, not to mention the miners hopping between the two chain and causing difficulty spikes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:34:24

The current situation doesn't work for anybody! Not for me, not for the big-blockers, not for the small-blockers. It's bad for the whole space!
The 2mb upgrade would have done a lot to help bring down fees and keep the community together. Now we have a war that will take its toll and both sides and everyone will pay dearly for this! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:46:16
I'm not sure that will help. The scaling war is far from over as the big blockers want BCH to become the main bitcoin chain, and one way to do that is to attack the main chain via the method I described. 
The worst part about this predicament is that it's PROFITABLE for the hopping miners to create these transaction backlogs as they get paid the blocks and the higher fees.
A lot of people on this sub are cheering the death of 2x fork, but they don't realize the war is just getting started and is about to get real nasty.

Good luck with that logic. A 2mb blocksize won't make a damn difference to "decentralization."
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:42:15
Maybe the exchanges trust non-Segwit transactions more? Could that be the reason?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:01:20
The thing is, with the BCH chain "stealing" away hashrate periodically from the main chain and causing these transaction backlogs, it may become necessary at some point to do a POW.
The large miners can now spike the hashrate on the main chain ahead of the difficulty adjustment date, thus raising the difficulty as the 2016th block is mined, and then go back to mining BCH.
This leaves the main chain with a much higher difficulty and lower hashrate after the adjustment period, which means higher block generation time.
This is exactly what happened after the last adjustment period on Oct. 26. The difficulty spiked 21.39% when the hashrate was 10,399,832,230 GH/s, and as miners switched to BCH, the bitcoin network lost about a third of that 10.3TH/s, and average block generation time went to 15 minutes, instead of the standard 10 minute.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:38:26
If the 2x was successful, we'd be at 10k by now. The market would have perceived the 2mb as successful upgrade, instead, we will now witness an arms race between btc &amp; bch, and the miners will be attacking the main chain by spiking the difficulty ahead of the adjustment block. 
Just check how much extra hashpower was added over the past few days to keep the difficulty from adjusting down by 20%!

So instead of being one unified community with Segwit and a 2mb upgrade, now we get 2 chains and a civil war? All of you NO2Xers will realize what a monumental mistake you've made in the coming weeks and months. If the 2x fork took place, BCH would have slid away into irrelevance!! 
Instead, now we have the biggest ASIC manufacturer backing it! The BCH supporters will now keep the difficulty on the 1mb chain high by spiking the hashrate ahead of the difficulty changeover block, and the mempool will be kept in a perpetual clog. 
Have any of you NO2Xers noticed how since the last difficulty change on Oct. 26, the mempool hasn't been cleaned up? You know why? It's because the block time has increased to 15 minutes and the difficulty has been kept from adjusting lower by the BCH miners!

Not really. You don't think it is relevant that major Chinese exchanges have invested customers' funds in some obscure "wealth management products?" 
Why isn't it public knowledge exactly what wealth management funds Huobi and Okcoin have invested in? Is BTCC also doing this? The article states 150 million USD, but how does anyone even know if its not more than that?
If the Chinese exchanges were so afraid of the PBoC's statement on ICOs, why did it take them more than a week to make the decision to close? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:19:25
Yes, but at what level of risk? And how much of this is even legal to begin with? My understanding was that everyone assumed Chinese exchanges have full custody of their clients' funds, but it turns out that isn't the case.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:29:22
Very good example. Think of all the costs of such an operation as the "fee" for getting you assets into digital format.

"explain Ethereum's primacy over Ethereum Classic." 
Check out Ethereum's price action before the crazy pump on Polo began. ETH was sliding in oblivion after the fork. It was down 0.007 and volume was on the decline. You think ETH just magically recovered all on its own?
The same applies to Ripple: P&amp;D!
The fork of ETH was under very different circumstances and ETH was an altcoin, it wasn't the gold standard of the industry like bitcoin is today. And let's face it: ETH was and is still backed by some of the biggest banksters on the planet.

You're missing the point. A split in bitcoin will forever tarnish bitcoin's reputation as a safe, immutable store of value. Neither chain will prosper!

@_date: 2017-05-30 17:36:41
So, is it really worth sinking the entire bitcoin experiment with this crazy UASF just to force SegWit and take out ASICBOOST, which we are not even sure is being used in the covert way? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:24:28
Yeah, two chains that will sink like stones. 
Also, keep in mind that the current hashpower securing the network will be split, so both chains will be less secure. At least that is my understanding, someone please correct me if that is not the case.

This is what a UASF may lead us to:

Wu has said he would support SegWit under certain conditions! Bitmain stands to loose hundreds of millions in future income if bitcoin splits and falls apart. From what I have read so far, Jihan just wants to see the 1mb lifted to 2mb. That is not an unreasonable request.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:48:12
Ok. Fair enough. I just can't understand why doesn't everyone just agree to a 2mb HF + Segwit. So much simpler!

"That's why there is no choice left but to support BIP148 and hopefully get enough support in time, to avoid a split altogether!"
So you are OK with risking the entire network on "hopefully" enough support? And if we don't? Doesn't sound like you have any real skin in the game.

Halle-fucking-lujah. Finally someone who sees the present situation for what it really is!! Couldn't have said it better myself. I am running a full Core node and I will not be supporting this fucking UASF shit. Segwit +2mb HF is the only way to go!!

Do we currently have any empirical evidence that ASICBOOST is being used by Bitmain? 
I understand that mining empty blocks at regular intervals may be an indication of ASICBOOST being used, but that is also not definitive proof. Correct?
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:21:32
This post explains what is likely to happen as a result of the UASF: 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:40:04
Isn't that because of these flimsy argument from some Core devs that a bump to 2mb will somehow cause the blockchain to grow too quickly and nobody will able to run a node? 
We need to give the big-blockers something. We can't just cram SegWit down their throats with no compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:06:07
Yep! Did anyone notice how BU hashrate increased just as the altcoin bubble popped? Now they're gonna ramp up the bitcoin split fear and get altcoins to pump again.

My intention is to not let a fucking chain split happen. As an investor, I do not wish to see that happen! 
EDIT: I honestly don't give a shit about the asicboost thing as long as SegWit and a 2mb hardfork happen. Splitting a $30+ billion decentralized payment network because of some mining gimmick/trick (asicboost) is absolute madness.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:23:36
"And maybe there will be place for two or more forks of Bitcoin, no matter how we'll call them."
This will mean the entire idea of decentralized, immutable cryptocurrency becomes obsolete. A chain split will be an event bitcoin will never recover from! Chain split= investor confidence crash!

Would it be that crazy to let Jiahn have his asicboost in exchange for supporting SegWit? I mean these guys are securing the network after all. Can't we implement SegWit without breaking asicboost?
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:36:42
Because it can create two competing chains. Large miners haven't backed it and all UASF supporters are trying to bully the exchanges into supporting it. Dirty tactics across the board!

I'm not sure I agree. A significant portion of the old-timers are big-blockers, very ideology-driven, very much against segwit. Those guys also have big stacks. If they start dumping the segwit-enabled chain, it will get real nasty for everybody.

It's because they're so caught in this whole debate that they can't even fathom how the non-crypto users/potential investors will perceive this whole fiasco. 
A lot of bitcoiners are under the impression that a two competing chains will somehow battle it out and the one with the best tech/value will win over. 
But what they don't see is that a chain split essentially kills off the idea of an immutable digital currency. Which just happens to be the entire point of bitcoin!! Chain split = game over!
And please don't bring up the Ethereum split, the circumstance here are totally different and ETH was nowhere near as popular, or as valuable, or the backbone of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, when it split.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:19:09
And if other major pools come under attack at critical times?
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:50:40


At this point, if the major exchanges were to be taken down, the price bitcoin would implode more than 50% in a matter of hours. It's very naive to talk about decentralization when the exchanges are only thriving because the authorities allow it! 


You are conflating die-hard Bitcoiners with "the masses!" Taking down the exchanges would push the die-hard Bitcoiners towards the anon alts, but those would also implode if the entire cryptospace comes in the crosshairs of the authorities! The masses at that point won't even bother.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:37:50
Looks like they just mined another non-segwit2x block.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:08:21
You're missing one thing though. In China, it makes sense to buy miners and mine because there is no paper trail to the bitcoin you obtain by mining. You can then move that bitcoin into offshore exchanges and sell, thus bypassing capital controls. Get it?

I'm not sure how much cash Bitmain may be willing to part with to stabilize BCC, but if Jihan decides to redirect significant hashrate  from BTC to BCC, things could get ugly. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:02:42
Precisely. Also, keep this in mind: any hashpower Bitmain dedicates to BCC will be hashpower that is not securing the main chain! Unless they have lots of miners sitting idle on the sidelines waiting for the BCC fork.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:14:55
Not the same thing! Not even close.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:40:10
For all we know the entire scaling fiasco could be one giant, orchestrated market manipulation scheme. LOL
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:35:33
The thing with BCC is that there is a distinct possibility Bitmain backs it! If that happens and the chain gets some serious hashrate, we may be looking at two competing Bitcoin chains.
The BCC chain essentially gives the big-blockers insurance against the NY Agreement falling apart before the scheduled hard fork in November. 
Bitmain currently has the option of supporting the NY agreement as well as BCC!
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:28:06

@_date: 2017-07-24 17:44:09
The take-down of the darknets removed a sizable portion of buyers! Imho, that surge we saw after bip-91 was a massive short-squeeze. In other words, the rally wasn't driven by genuine demand but by short sellers being forced into closing their positions.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:33:20
We don't know if this unknown source belongs to Bitmain, but it would very interesting to find out who that is.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:33:00
That would be correct. But a reduced hashrate/difficulty = reduction in price. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:12:38
Thanks for the reply.
"When BIP-91 locks in there will be another 336 blocks for miners to get ready for BIP-91 activation"
And if not everyone is signaling on bit 1? Fork?
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:00:21
Decentralization is just a buzzword, profit-driven speculators don't give a shit about that. Bitmain is the biggest ASIC manufacturer and if they back BCC, speculators' perception of BCC may change very quickly. I would not be surprised if Bitmain has significant hashpower sitting on the sidelines for just such an event.
I could never really understand why Jihan would comply so quickly with the Segwit2x proposal without any assurances of the 2mb HF taking place in November, but if he was secretly preparing to support a big-block fork all this time, his compliance thus far makes a lot more sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:04:55
What I'm getting at is that by filling up the blocks and causing such delays, an impression is manufactured that bitcoin is being used so much that the network is barely able to keep up. Get it?
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:11:13
I have been watching the hashrate fluctuations recently and Antpool's hashrate has been jumping like crazy over the last week.
There is also an "unknown" source with a 7.7% of the hashpower. If anyone knows who that is, please let me know. These screens are from Bitcoinity:

Antpool just mined a 5th consecutive one. Weird shit: 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:28:18
You can interpret that however you wish. Anyhow, let's see if Bitmain backs BCC. Interesting times we live in.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:30:50
And what are the odds Bitmain finds so many blocks in a row just as Bip91 is about to lock-in? LOL
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:29:38

@_date: 2017-07-20 17:05:37
After lock-in, the signaling has to be maintained till Aug 1st for segwit to activate, right?

I'm all for decentralization - it's why I got so interested in bitcoin in the first place. But let's face it, there's only so much decentralization you can have in the world we currently live in. 
The exchanges themselves are Bitcoin's biggest Achilles' heel. What good is Bitcoin's so-called decentralization if the exchanges themselves can be taken down at the drop of a hat by governments?

The mere fact that this scenario is within the realm of possibility should be enough to dissuade you. We're gonna risk the bitcoin's reputation as a store of value - a reputation that has built up since inception - because we don't want to negotiate with the miners? 
Am I the only one who thinks this is absolutely insane?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:34:28

"The split will be permanent, the price (combined) may take a hit, but will eventually will recover, just like after the split with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic."
Not a valid comparison. Bitcoin will never survive a split! If bitcoin undergoes a chain split with 2 competing chains, the entire idea of immutability and store of value goes out of the window. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:45:44
Fyi: Shutting down those markets also reduced demand of bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:31:45
We can tell how many "real" nodes are signaling by looking at ones that are on residential IPs. Those IPs is a lot harder to obtain!
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:58:59
No, I mean if all/most the exchanges suspend trading on Aug 1 and Bitcoin ABC launches, there won't be any trading whatsoever. It will just be miners deciding which chain to support. At least that's how I see it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:54:18

@_date: 2017-06-04 17:09:07
If Bip148 had any support we would have thousands of nodes by now, instead, what we have is a tiny minority running it. What I would also like to see is how many of the Bip148 nodes are on residential IPs - those IPs are much harder to fake and represent a much more accurate measurement of "real" support.
Most of the Core devs have said that the UASF is risky and reckless, and I stand with them. I run a full Core node and I will not be supporting this divisive and potentially harmful proposal.

The devs have started slinging mud on social media and the community seems to be tearing itself apart. I never thought I would see this kind of BS. 
The way I see it: if bitcoin can't stay together, it doesn't survive. And please, don't bring up the ETH split, it's not even close.

Are you even listening to yourself?

Stop knocking over Muslim countries like Syria and Lybia. The Manchester bomber was essentially a product of the Lybian conflict. Terrorists are the byproducts of Western foreign policy, not to mention the dirty hands of the Saudis.

In Bitcoin, a $100 drop is referred to as a "downtick."

Nice attempt at spinning this uncomfortable fact, but NO! Most users that run full nodes are also investors. They have a much better understanding of the technical aspects of bitcoin and are very capable of making an informed decision.
The fact that UASF isn't being signaled by majority of Core nodes tells me everything I need to know. UASF = dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:09:55
So we're gonna have everyone paying high fees because we want to make sure the poor Egyptians can run a full node?
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:28:22
The UASF fanatics do not have majority support. The number of nodes supporting UASF has stalled and no major exchange will back a proposal that risks the network and has the potential to do heavy damage to bitcoin's reputation as a store of value.

Also, keep in mind that there is no hard, empirical evidence that Bitmain is using covert ASICboost. A bunch of circumstantial evidence emerged and everyone went crazy over ASICboost. 
Unless we have iron clad proof that Bitmain is currently using covert ASICboost, I personally believe it's unethical to hurl accusations based on circumstantial evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:37:54


I fully agree with you, but not by splitting the chain and causing millions in damage.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:52:14
The Bitcoin ecosystem is composed of miners, users and businesses such as Bitmain. All have a say on the scaling debate! 
if a solution doesn't satisfy all three, it won't be adopted and the status quo remains. 
Strong-arm tactics like the UASF have the potential to do significant financial damage  and for this reason I am vehemently opposed to it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:10:54
The UASF is dead in the water. No support from node operators, No support from exchanges! Give it up. 
Nobody is going to allow you to ruin the entire experiment because you don't want to negotiate with the miners! Not gonna happen! 
EDIT: Segwit2X is our best chance right now.

Has it occurred to you that people have lives outside of crypto-space and that many new users will not even know what is going on. How the fuck is Coinbase and other exchanges going to "inform" their users since they themselves won't know how this whole thing turns out?


It won't matter who is in the wrong, it will be absolute chaos and very damaging to bitcoin's reputation - damage that bitcoin, and the whole cryptocurrency movement for that matter, may never recover from. 


I have asked this question repeatedly on the sub and I will ask it once again: Where is the hard, empirical evidence that Bitmain is/has been using Asicboost? 
This so-called "covert asicboost" issue keeps being brought up as some kind of undisputed, proven fact, when it fact it is nothing more than a wild allegation backed up with some circumstantial evidence.

I don't fear a price drop, I fear a bitcoin split that causes massive financial damage to millions of unsuspecting users. The financial losses by a reorganization of the legacy chains are incalculable. There is no way to even predict how many people will be affected by such an event. 


Maybe you don't, but many others do care and they will not run a full node that signals BIP 148! 
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:39:46
So we will have 2 bitcoin chains each with 21 million coins and half the hashrate on each? Newcomers are confused enough as it is about bitcoin, but now there are magically 2 different bitcoins? Try explaining that one to investors!
Is bitcoin going to continue splitting each time there is difference of opinion on scaling or any other contentious issue?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:31:22
Wouldn't the best course of action for the exchanges be to just halt all trading &amp; deposits after Aug 1st to avoid financial losses?
Why would they list both chains if it's practically impossible to determine how the whole chain split fiasco plays out?
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:29:12
Not when you have several years of bickering, backstabbing and lies. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:18:23
Exactly. I have said this multiple times and I will keep repeating it. The damage a chain split and a reorg will do to bitcoin's reputation as a safe, secure store of value, is incalculable. This UASF business is extremely risky and has the potential to do great financial harm. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:04:31
You prob don't wanna know.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:55:09
I'm sure it will happen, and I'm fairly certain it will also fail spectacularly come Aug 1st. The major exchanges &amp; miners will not get behind a proposal that threatens the entire network.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:17:27
hello 3000 USD my NEW friend...
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:36:36
This! I have been a bitcoiner for some years now and I fully support SegWit, but I don't support this risky UASF idea. I also run a full Core node!!
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:29:11
So by your logic anyone who displays the slightest amount of disagreement is a "hostile miner" or a sock puppet? 
Miners have invested millions in hardware and infrastructure to keep bitcoin secure; Companies like Coinbase have invested millions in compliance costs to bring bitcoin to the masses; and you are calling them sock puppets? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:24:32
This is the point I have been trying to make in both subs. A lot of fanatics are under the impression that after a split, one chain will emerge as the winner. In their minds, the possibility that the whole cryptocurrency experiment fails spectacularly as a result of a chain split is nonexistent!! As a bitcoin investor and proponent, this scares me very much.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:32:21
Is there any estimation on how much ETH is locked up in these ICOs?
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:01:50
Majority wants segwit, but very few will sacrifice the entire network to get it! Bitcoin will never survive a split the way Ethereum did! 
No one will give a shit about segwit, or bigger blocks for that matter, in the event bitcoin splinters into 2 competing chains that go in different directions. At that point, most investors will abandon the space as the very idea of a decentralized, immutable store of value will become nothing more than wishful thinking.
Fanatical Bip148 supporters seem to be completely oblivious to how this whole fiasco will be perceived by investors and newcomers to the scene, not to mention the potential monetary damage businesses and users will incur as a result of a reorg. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:31:17
Yet another reason why Bip148 is reckless and risky. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:05:54
I agree with everything you said, however, the miners have a say in the matter whether we like it or not. In the current situation that we find ourselves in, the only reasonable proposals are segwit2x by Garzik or a 2mb HF + segwit.
