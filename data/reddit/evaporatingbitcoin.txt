It is true that the value of Bitcoin evaporates.
We have to be frank, it was a bubble. Even though the technology behind Bitcoin is genius, there was no real reason for it to be worth $1,000 or even $100.
Bitcoin could not worth more than a couple of dollars. In the future it might be one alternative means of exchange, but it can never be a store of value.
I therefore expect the price evaporation to continue until it settles to a couple of dollars. Good

Don't let the early adopters with big wallets full of coins earned almost for free, unload on you and become millionaires. 
Dump your coins and stay out. Let them eat their coins.

Someone dumped 4,500 coins in one sell order, if you have been watching the live trading session you would have seen it...
There are many early adopters who have wallets as big as that (even bigger actually, example the guy with the 28,000 coin sell order at $300 right now).
They wait for the formation of walls and then unload the coins in one single sell order. It's called "the slaughter of the sheep".
Don't let them slaughter you. Dump your bitcoins and stay out. There is no need to make these kits/early adopters, millionaires.
