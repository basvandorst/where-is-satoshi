Bitcoin cash has instant transfers with less than 10 cents as fee's. :)

Solving all that shit is the point of Bitcoin Cash really.

This is a very stupid discussion, this guy clearly doesn't have a clue about business valuation.

The dev team point is all you got going?
The way I see it, I tried using bitcoin a few months ago and it took AGES for the transactions to settle, and on top of that I had to pay obscene fees.
As it is, legacy BTC is simply a worthless payment alternative. It is truly worst in every way when stacked against traditional payment methods.
What's the point of it, then?
BCH on the other hand, is built to compete properly with other payment alternatives. It is fast, has low fees and can scale.
That's what it boils down to, truly. Payments is a gigantic market, and if any crypto can start to scale and provide people with a better solution, it will win.
Legacy BTC can't do that. I know because I've tried using it. Think like Steve Jobs: this shit has to be awesome from a stupid-average-consumer point of view. Your grandma couldn't be swayed to use BTC versus her credit card or wires in a million years. Exchanges, wallets, miner fees? Fuck jumping through those hoops for slow transactions.
And the community of oh-so-smart developers you mentioned can't seem to get to any consensus on how to solve that. Hell, if they did, maybe BCH wouldn't even have to exist in the first place.

*Read this in Steve Carell's voice:* 
Guys, it's two very simple questions: is bitcoin cash better than bitcoin, and if so, why shouldn't we all just switch?
Have you ever considered the actual possibility that BCH is simply better than BTC?

Whoa there. The report includes curing cancer and exploring the outer solar system. I think these things are a bit more grandiose than Bitcoin.

Sorry for being so rude. Probably was having a bad day.
