read a book on how btc works, you seem to be very uninformed
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:10:16
you can only download the block headers and the merkle root of the transactions in them. then once you need to verify transactions, you can download them on demand and be sure they are in the corresponding blocks due to the merkle root.
this is a very high lvl explanation

good luck trying to sue an anonymous entity on openbazaar or some darknet marketplace. his reputation will not suffer, since he could come up with plenty of reasons for R being released even though the channel was already closed - DoS, software malfunction, some possible sybian attack, hell he could even claim someone found a preimage collision
@_date: 2016-04-14 09:57:31
yes you are correct by mentioning the term social solution.. but thats no real solution. especially in a semi-pseudonymous domain.
imagine this would be done in openbazaar, or any other platform where identity is not properly checked. good luck trying to claim your rights or even take legal action. also, yes proper code should not allow that, but this is no solution either.
proper code should not have allowed the recent doublespends demonstrated by peter todd. yet this can not be enforced and anyone able to write the code could do it ;)
edit: "you're basically giving money to Carol" - this is precisely what i meant whe ni mentioned a scam being pulled by carol and dave, who would later split the money while deflecting the blame from dave himself, who may be a well established/reputable trader.

you realize it took several years before opcode was actually stored in memory, right? initially only the operands where in memory and opcodes were switched manually (early computer days)

@_date: 2016-04-14 10:07:36
well yes, but if dave was a well established/reputable trader, he would not want to ruin his reputation. thus he could team up with charley/carol who do not care about their reputation. i explicitly mention reputation, because in semi anonymous marketplaces this would be the most important criterion to pick a buyer.
@_date: 2016-04-14 10:31:29
this argument is ridiculously stupid.. well lets happily assume everything is perfect, there are no flaws, no possible exploits.

asymmetric cryptography
its like computing  3²² = 31381059609
but given only 3 and 31381059609, your only bet of finding the exponent 22 is trial and error.  now imagine this with hundred digit numbers

its reversing the ln dude. this is a hard problem known as discrete log problem (applies to primes).
easy to compute but given only the 3 and the end result there is no efficient way to calculate the exponent. so in cryptos a similar thing is used - elliptic curve discrete log.
thats all a veeeeery simplified explanation though

cutting the electricity from a few pools will cripple it, so it will be very vulnerable. this period is crucial to convince the public that bitcoin is bad, but the timewindow is very small.

Even if the chance is minuscule, it still is there. If you can sleep better by splitting the coins to multiple addresses - do it (I did, just for the psychological relief).
There may be one other important reason to split you coins to different addresses: security/anonymity.
if you have lets say 100coins on 1 address and transfer a small amount to someone, he WILL know that you own 100.
if they are split on multiple addresses, no one can tell how many you really control.
Hope this helps

this is true.
at huge drops like today, their page completely freezes.
if you place a market sell, it will execute waaay below this.
Same goes for buy orders.. most of the time they simply wont trigger until the price spikes again.

@_date: 2017-02-27 14:10:43
this + additional security.
1) by spending from an address, you expose the public key, which is otherwise hidden behind a hash.
public key crypto is vulnerable to quantum computers, so in theory one could find out your private key.
2) by sending multiple times from the same address, you generate multiple signatures with the same private key. Hence you run the risk of generating the same K value twice (i wont explain that in detail). This basically also reveals your private key.
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:49:21

this is so misleading, what it says is basically the following:
all transaction related data, whereby european customers are involved SHOULD be stored within the EU.
basically they dont want customer data to be on some servers n malaysia or taiwan. the idea is that data about EU customers remains within the eu.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:10:21
he could in theory do that, but this would be a huge risk for the attacker himself, in case the rest of the network retaliates and the users do not follow him.
btw a checkpoint would not prevent anything.
it would be just a hardcoded hash of a certain blockheight. but this does not infer anything about any transactions.
for a wipeout to occur, the attacker needs to create an entire new chain from scratch - up to the current blockheight

You do NOT need a second trezor.
Simply use trezors password option. The password is added as an additional word to the seed to create an entirely new wallet. So you still need your seed words + you need to remember one additional word to access your coins.
You can hide the password in a different place to reduce the risk of both being stolen.
This is more than secure

because old wallets were not deterministic, thus if you did not backup your wallet.dat file, you had no way of getting them back.
each address was purely rng generated, and did not depend on any seed.

so basically useless for btc, since it uses a different curve. also some 3lettr agencies could easily spoof the signature generated by it, IF there are indeed backdoors as suspected - thus turning its self verification questionable.

the timelocked transaction is unnecessarily large (more btc/byte).
since it its timelocked it doesnt need to be signed by both, but only by the party creating it.
barbies would be:
(sig)barbie + 48h lockout
kens would be:
(sig)ken + 24h lockout
the endresult is the same. each party can get their money back, after the lockout expires. but the overall size of the transaction is now smaller.
you probably got confused and copied too much from the lightning contract-transaction-type, where you need both parties to sign the lockout transaction.

I think you are still somewhat confused.. 
a way of creating priv keys in a deterministic way is to take a bunch of "seed" words and hash them to create a master priv key. from this master priv key you can "deterministically" create an infinite amount of new keys which would look random.
what these services do is help you recover the master private key if you know lets say 20 out of 24 seed words needed.

You seem to have a very bad understanding of how bitcoin works. And to be clear - no, it does not.
Edit: Your other statements about tor and email addresses also do not make sense. The only idea of TOR is that you remain anonymous on the internet(your ip can not be traced back to your internet provider and then back to you). If you put your email out on some site it doesnt matter if you do it via tor or not. And httpS secures a communication so that lets say your neighbours who cracked your wifi password can not see what sites you visit and what credit card number you type in your browser.
I seriously encourage you to watch some videos on youtube about https/ssl/tls and maybe even read some books about networks and routing
@_date: 2016-10-05 14:40:45
from: 
loosely translated:
OneCoin boasts with a weekly independent audit by "Semper Fortis". When contacting the auditing company, it was revealed that all business relations between semper fortis and onecoin have been terminated due to reputational risc (for semper fortis). Onecoin however, continued pointing out the non-existent audits.
add consumer deception and false advertising to the list..
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:40:20
okay maybe a naive suggestion, but what if wallets:
- marked change addresses as such
- gave the user the option to do potentially untainted transactions, by not using any of the change addresses
(e.g. only using addresses, not marked as change)
- had the option to swipe all accumulated change addresses into one address and clearly marking it as such
this could be unlockable via some advanced options, since the average user wouldnt care. but for those few actually paying attention at privacy this would be of great help
