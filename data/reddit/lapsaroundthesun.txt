The relevant part of this meeting is that it was the first time that the BTC community gathered formally in Moscow. Many topics were discussed, emails exchanged, ideas shared and also clear intentions to approach to regulators and to organise a clear proposal from the BTC community of Russia to ensure that the road is paved for crypto here.

I do and Im very very happy about this. 
Imagine: How different is the internet now when comparing with 1994-1996??. Where do you think this technology would be in 2017-2018??
If you have understood the historic importance, geopolitical relevance and technological leap that BTC means, you will NEVER be ashamed of holding to such a value and such a piece of innovation and empowering concept.
Good luck and best riddance to all of you cryptocurrency-savy humans. History will tell, but I really think we are on the right track on this one.

I do have a Btc-e account and got it also! I believe its a phising email too. I normally use BTC-e and they NEVER write in that style + almost everything in their exchange requires dual indentification + THEY ARE NOT LOCATED IN TOKYO. Agree that It can totally be from the Gox database. 
Users beware! Double confirm everything before clicking a link!
Contacted also BTC-e support about this!

A source of unbiased info?? Only one:: reading all the content, learn a lot about history, demography, culture, religion, economics &amp; politics and make your own opinion.
Funny and worth mentioning that everyone in this sub love to echo RT's supportive bitcoin articles and many watch the keiser report ... however and conveniently, sometimes RT becomes a "propaganda machine" whenever the argument becomes necesary.

I inderstand my friend that you are trying to help and this is completely legitimate and honorable! however I believe that the way its presented distances your blog from beign a BTC site and it turns it into a well defined political entity. If you have the chance try to separate them more do it. It will increase the credibility of what you are trying to communicate in both fields.

Well. Everyone has its point of view and I respect the fact you have your own view on the subject. Im not russian nor slavic, Im south american and I live in Moscow. History Is written by mainstream media and to my appretiation, Russia's image in the world has been carefully damaged by prople that has a lot of power and that want more power. This country is NOT what CNN, BBC, Huffington Post, The Economis, FOX News or CNBC are saying it is.

As a venezuelan that COMPLETELY disagrees withe the government, the state od our economy and the humanitarian recor of the one in power I must say that I COMPLETELY AGREE with your stance and support your argument. BTC is about a new financial order and NOT about interpretations to ways of governing or a voice-amplifier to channel our political stands. I have distanced myself of people that use political situations to communicate their bitcoin stands. Im sure there are some worthy examples but I have not found them yet.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:30:49
Completely agree! The average joe must be able to use this with just one button and be secure if BTC its going to go to mars and beyond!

I was also a late arrival to bfl and I must say I profoundly disagree with any sort of compassion / comperhension to such disloyal and shady attitude. 
This is a company that promised and didnt deliverd and actually trolled some of the people that were complaining rightfully. 
The comparrison you make to a kickstsrter project is not valid. They could have perfectly gathered funds via kickstarter for "starters"... yet they promissed a fully operational product/company that simply wasnt ready to enter into the market and they used our trust / enthusiasm as a way to gather investment funds and dindt were clear or honest about their intentions . 
The pre-order I made promissed a 2 month delivery and it still hasnt arroved after 7 months. Their customer service was reduced to a blog with sporadic comments available instead of being COMPLETELY transparent in times of customer dissatisfaction. 
Im trully amazed / angry that this company still exists. Im sorry but to mee this was a clear scam that damaged some of the trust that early adopters had deposited in BTC

Transaction fees are still WAY lower than what banks recieve for foregin transfers. Appart from that, one hour is way faster than 5 working days (talking about international transfers here, but also applies in a lesser extent to national inter-bank transfers). Appart from that Bitcoin has no working days :: A transfer made on a sunday arrives on a sunday. 
About exchange fees, still when you round up you end up paying less than a bank transfer. Also buying coins in local coins incurrs in no fees at all.

Thanks a lot! Maybe the way I describe it in english sounds a bit more formal than what I truly mean! We are just planning to transform some of our wealth to BTC because we truly believe in the currency (for all the political, financial and ideological reasons). Yesterday I explained to my in-laws what Bitcoin is and their reaction was fantastic! They were SO interested in it! I think that the world never imagined that this sentence would be written "Post-Soviet Bitcoin Investments" :)... Sometimes I truly love the XXI's century.

Im an economist and I saw the inside job. My point is complementary to the subprime crisis and its obvios that large banks where in the center of the huracain. I bet you will find great agreeance with this idea here. This  does have to with bitcoin because BTC also carries a political and social connotation. It is time to decentralise the mecanism of transfer of wealth and the global reserve currency. 
Speaking of the pollitics involved, I dindt even mention the fact that the federal reserve bank's manipulation of the dolar at will has HUGE implications over the worlds economy. A new and descentralized deposit of value is needed to insure a more fair global market. Bitcoin is far away still from being that, yet is well on the way. 
Just these ideas I present above without considering the practical implications I mention in the first reply are enough to justify the use of BTC.

This reminds me of a 1994 NY times article about how the internet will never really take over the world. I dont think banks will be replaced in the same way as people still using telephone and fax machines today. This is the first serious reinvention of money and its going to keep changing the game a day at a time.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:10:28
Yes! I completely told them exactly that same sentece! Yet they were truly inspired by the idea of a currency with no Central Authority involved. They apparently trust me a lot :) (I hope). I said "I dont want to be the responsible to lose a part of our money" to what they said "We are in this together". Seems like the relations are going well! Thanks a lot to all of you for your advice! It truly motivates us to join in with a bigger chunk of Cash! I allready have a very small amount of BTC's that I partly mined, partly purchased since June, however Im ready to push it further and literally "Put my money where my mouth is".
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:32:11
Agree! I think that right now the BC community needs spokepersons that talk and behave in the most mainstream way possible to transmit security and comperhensive information to the average Joe. 
I agree with the spirit of the speech of Amir, but I feel that it fails to deliver a solid message that speaks to a wider audience.
Also, In third world countries I think its unrealistic to imagine at this point the adoption of phisical bitcoins would be so easy.
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:17:43

Transfers = Almost instant to any place on the world ((circa 10 mins))
Transfers = you can choose your transaction fee and they are VERY low ((the ammount you set will determine the priority in which your payment will be processed)
Transfers = no authorization is requiered for you to transfer your money. Only you and your secret password.
Payments directly to merchants = No trusted 3d party is needed. So payments go directly to the merchants  without any extra fees or shadow payments involved
Payments via systems like bitpay = fees payed by merchants for processing are minimal and payments clear instantly
In summary = because the "trusted" third party system is completely obsolete, its stalling our development and capturing funds just by standing inbetween you and the person you need or want to pay / transfer too. Because we are 5 years after the 2008 financial collapse and we all should have learnt by now that the cancer in the global system has a name and a last name :: Banks that are too big to fail. 
I dont suggest the elimination of the banking sector, but I do believe that the desentralization of the transfer of value will most certainly add velocity and help to cut costs and burocracy in a way that will allow the global economy to flourish to new levels thst we have never seen before.
Sorry for typos, Im writing from my mobile.

I think that people's desire to become Instantanoisly rich with cryptocurrencies bring many problems . We are all in the process of building an alternative and decentralised financial system that is not concieved "to make you rich". I mine at the rythm I can afford at the time because I believe in this alternative and I want to seed it with my computational power. Apart from that, I have faith (one can only have faith in this at the moment) that this will become a mainstream currency that (because of its scarcity) it will be once valued very hghly. Anyone who stops mining now may regret it dearly in the future.

Off course I dont suggest to ban anything.

This answer is specifically about the MT GOX issue :: Bitcoin personal and local exchanges shloud be favoured and are very undervalued in this discussion ! I went cycling yesterday to buy my my bitcoins! its in its escense to be P2P.... For bigger numbers and faster transactions I also see Lamassu cash2bitcoinATM ( as a good promise for de-centralisation. Max Keiser also promised a competing exchange. Lets hope more serious blokes enter to the scene to opent that market up as it should be.

Completely agree with this comment. The west is fueling a revolt for their interests, not a revolution for the good of the masses.

Thanks a lot for doing this! So... two questions :: &gt;&gt;
Is it in any way safer to keep your Wallet closed whilst being online?! Or the only threat is that someone will steal your .dat file? 
And another question (I expect it to be considered a dumb one but Id like to see the answer)... If I have a UBER SAFE password and I have NEVER stored that password anywhere online! Why should I be worried? Is it really possible to brake ANY password? Or the main security concerns come from dumb / unsafe practices?

To my understanding of most of the mainstream detractors, they see this fact as the main backdrop of Bitcoin. In many cases, they introduce a subsequent counter-argument in their speech that cires for the illegitimacy or the suspension of BTC-related activities. 
I Have also heard the term "Hacker's Currency"  which I think is detrimental for the health of the BTC mainstream perception+adoption (example in spanish) :: 
My intention is just to ridiculize anyone who brings this argument up... ALL ILEGAL TRANSACIONS (before 2008) that have happened in the world have occurred in good old fashioned FIAT money.  I have never heard anyone arguing against FIAT money using this argument, I think that the same should apply to BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:22:00
I fealt that he ironically says "Im rich... I have .7 bitcoins". Is it my bad sense of humour, or the BBC has remained skeptikall about the whole idea since the begining? Im trully open for opinions.
