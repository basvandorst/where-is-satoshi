How can you take 3 transactions per second when I have been waiting nearly a day for transaction to be confirmed 1KJzp1VQegwAhH8c4mjnEmhnGRbXKY62Hg ....... 49000 unconfirmed transactions and one block every twenty mins my transaction should be confirmed by 2019!!!
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:02:43
Get me on a block pleass
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:46:45
They don't let me choose the fee I would have put 1$ fee at least 
@_date: 2016-10-26 22:18:50
What if I send the dollar to the same Bitcoin address with a higher fee would that push both through
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:07:35
I would have paid more if I was able to , it says I paid 0.08 in fees I would have paid 1$ if I could haved
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:45:13
How do I cancel with Bither wallet?
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:43:08
I have mine since 1:45 est with no confirmations starting to worry
