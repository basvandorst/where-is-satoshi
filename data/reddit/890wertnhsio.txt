they did an attack where they "spam pattern" activity to the tor site then went to the ISPs to find the pulsing data leading them to the server(s)
pretty simple and devious, only works if you're in bed with the ISPs though (via the current method of figurative rape aka. gag order+national security)
you can't even add a NAT and another onion circuit to block this, as the traffic pattern still ends up at the same nodes
you could try to make it obscure by introducing your own "noise" but I'm afraid that a large sampling finds the pattern regardless of other spam

this is comming to an end
you can't have war unless you control the currency via trust and the idea of what worth is
viet nam would have costed way too much gold, so they debased it and made funny money after people trusted them, they got manipulated and slighted, and it's still happening

all bankers diffuse responsibility, so you will need to visit the chamber of the [central banking computer core]( to get a dot matrix printout of the agreement

have you ever thought about how for so long brainwashing and incremental conditioning were tools used deliberately to dilute and diffuse the idea of worth.
it is ***worth*** being free

being protective is all good
 but what do you do when a powerful faceless entity gets a hair up its ass about you, and uses every evil grudging avenue of attack against you?  mere physical violence is just the tip of the iceberg!

they debased the dollar because the viet nam war would have been too expensive to fund using actual money
it's been a debt slavery bondage spiral ever since


no they don't.  we feed ourselves.  The elite 'merely' decide how much of our energy we expend to be able to eat.
ever since our idea of money has been raped and perverted we have been in decline.
it's the elite/state/whatever tries to make it seem like what they're doing isn't causing that decline.
The entire pile of 'pseudomonetary' shit is ***about to burn***.

*ment* literally means "mind"
governer, like a governer on a gasoline engine is there to control the maximum intake speed.
*govern* means "control"
so *government* = "control mind"
take it for what you will
