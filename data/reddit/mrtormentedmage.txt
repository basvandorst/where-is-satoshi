What about mobile data

I don't want people to guess. I just wanted to get an idea of good platforms that allow to send btc to a private wallet (because some of them only allow fiat withdrawal) and i would do my own research

After all, house mormont �� knows no king but the king in the north whose name is stark.

Most platforms are not available in my country of residence. Uphold and Indacoin are the ones i'm currently looking into

"Don't you think the whales manipulated the price up on Saturday in the same way they manipulated it down on Sunday? I got news for you. The whales don't care about you and me. They care about money."
This is what i'm saying. We don't have a chance. Its all manipulated

She doesn't know what bitcoin is. I bear the child no ill will, its another case of greedy parents using children for money. I feel bad for people who work hard all year and make less than what guys who set these things up earn
