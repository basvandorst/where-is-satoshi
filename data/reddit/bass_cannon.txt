This makes me think that they are considering the usefulness of crypto to their business. They move millions of tons of coffee beans around the world and have to pay farmers in all different currencies. They are very much in the FOREX business as a result. If they can accept a global currency that moves with minimal friction such as BTC, then they can pay their plantations and other suppliers with it. 
Coffee is one of the most influential substances and commodities of human being history. I think BTC and coffee beans go quite well. 
Also I can’t help but think the people who grow coffee are in regions where currencies are already unstable and could actually benefit from bitcoin right now. 
What a great way to use this technology exactly as it was intended.

It's a simple situation if one understands the tax code. Bitcoin exchanges are securities and brokerage accounts as per IRS guidelines. Any foreign security and brokerage account with a value of $10,000.00 or more must be declared on your return. if you held on mt gox an amount of bitcoin that totaled more than $10,000.00 you have to declare it on your tax return as a Foreign Bank Account. 
This, by the way, does not affect your tax liability. You will not pay more taxes by declaring this but if you are caught not reporting this balance you will pay a penalty.

The main issue WF points out here is the volatility of bitcoin. 
Money, or a currency is typically thought of 
as having three characteristics: (1) that it functions as a 
medium of exchange, (2) a unit of account, and (3) a store of 
When there are dramatic price swings in BTC, the unit of account aspect and store of value property are negatively affected. 
This highlights a need for someone to come along and force price stability. Second Market is on the right track by pricing bitcoin a few times a day on their fund as opposed to in real time. 
Once bitcoin price is stable and predictable wide spread usage will follow.

People can pretend to say this is good news but China's population is one billion people more than the USA. Imagine if all of them had access to bitcoin and used it all. There's a need for innovation of bitcoin technologies in that country.

I think it's interesting how every time there is a negative movement in btc price there seems to be a large company coming out to accept it 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:53:38
Yes this is right. dblcross121 is making sense and giving you proper advice. 
All i would add is that the IRS is not looking for people that have had 10K in their accunt. Or 20k. They are looking for the large account holders that they can really collect large penalties from. The IRS does not have the capacity to chase down someone like you. You have nothing to worry about. All those out there that have had large foreign bitcoin balances should report it on their return. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:56:46
Hiding income and not paying taxes on it is illegal and wrong. You can't expect bitcoin to be taken seriously of you plan on using it as a tax haven. Bitcoin has great potentials but evading taxes is not one I see.

Really thorough and accurate report, everyone should read this.

Bitcoin. The word represents two things: A currency and a payment network. One can speak in terms of exchanging bitcoin or using the bitcoin protocol. The real beauty is the latter, as highlighted in this video. The bitcoin protocol and the blockchain are inventions and breakthroughs that have never been possible before due to our hardware limitations. Currently it is difficult for people to grasp the blockchain and the payment network that is bitcoin because it is so foreign.

What I was thinking was an exchange keeping a constant price for a determined amount of time. Say an exchange opened and sold btc for $1,000.00 a piece for the first 3 months of a year. Based on market activity it would adjust the price at the end of the 3 month period.

Chase bank does not support bitcoin related activities. I tried opening a business account with them but once I mentioned that I would be dealing with bitcoins they refused to open an account for me. They showed me documentation related to the banking secrecy act that disallows account activity that is bitcoin related. If your account hasn't been closed it is only a matter of time. I took all of my business to Bank Of America and am very happy there.

Thanks for your response -
I left it open ended and vague to get the simplest most honest answer from people. I'm currently an industrial psychology major and am very involved in the BTC space with my own venture. I have no coding or programming experience but I would still be interested in comp sci. 
I love the power bitcoin has to disrupt many industries. Uber for example is a company I really admire for that fact alone. That is why I want to get involved with it career-wise

The truth is they do not know. If you sold on coinbase the IRS may find out if Coinbase reports the activity to them.
Coinbase asked you that question for AML reasons not for tax purposes, most likely.

So how would this look in my wallet where I hold the private keys? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:13:11
So if it does fork and we have BTU and BTC I have been reading that users would then have as many BTU as they do BTC.
So for example if I have 10 btc in a wallet after the fork I will have 10 BTC and 10 BTU. 
How could this be? What am I missing here?

So will I be able to spend the same btc on both the btc network and the BTU network? If so, how would I go about doing that? I don't see how my wallet would suddenly have two lines in it showing 10 btc and 10 BTU

Yes 3k per year and if you have more than that you can carryover your losses into future years.

Gains on bitcoin trades are taxable only when you realize them . This means you pay tax on any bitcoins sold for USD or if you purchase anything with bitcoins.

This happens all the time with traditional financial institutions even when dealing with stock. Let's say you transfer your Microsoft shares into a brokerage account. Sometimes the new brokerage doesn't know your original cost basis.
On the 1099 the new broker has the option of not reporting cost basis to IRS. It is then up to you to choose the cost basis. IRS will never know and they just take your word. 
If we are dealing with a large amount of money and you happen to get audited then you have to show the proof, of course.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:40:41
Coinbase will do you good. What does the transaction history look like on your coinbase account? Is there any indication of outgoing transfer? What wallet or service are you sending your coins to?
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:01:56
That is my biggest concern as well. There needs to be a solution for when you send funds to your own external wallet. The IRS will need to develop a way to verify your ownership of privately held keys.

I believe this would increase the scarcity of the asset and therefore increase the price. Demand will still be there because bitcoin's utility stays the same no matter the governing laws of specific countries.

@_date: 2019-04-27 20:45:14
What about a charge back? Your limitations don’t protect from that. Someone pays me, I send bitcoin, a few days later the payment is reversed. Without having their ID on file, you encourage this to happen and you make it much easier for those to get away with it.
Also, how about criminals? What do you do to make sure I’m not dealing with someone trying to launder proceeds from criminal activities?
