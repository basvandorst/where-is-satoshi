Correct, it is not required that you announce your channel to participate in the network. For example, your mobile phone would likely not announce that it is routable due to intermittent connectivity, but it could still send or receive txns when online. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:28:44
This is incorrect. At the moment, each node verifies and stores the entire graph, and then uses source routing to compute paths locally.

Adding or removing an HTLC takes 1.5 round trips between two peers, which applies both in the forward and backwards direction. In 0.7.1, the 1.5\*N RTTs on the backwards path is reduced to .5\*N. So total reduction is ends up being from 3\*N to 2\*N, or 33% of the RTTs for the whole path.  
In some local benchmarks I found the latency improvement to be slightly higher, more like 40%. Presumably this is because those extra RTTs involve more expensive operations like signing that we are no longer blocking on, but we'll have a better idea once this is deployed over the wider network

This is true, but my statement doesn't say that the movement of tokens resembles a lottery. Simply that the history of winning tickets records these movements. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:06:15
Bitcoin is a digital lottery that records transfers between accounts as a sequence of winning tickets. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:54:18
How so? Anyone is allowed to "purchase" a ticket by expending the energy to hash it. The great thing about the system is that it's publicly verifiable. Hence you know if you've "won" at the moment of purchase. The coinbase reward is distributed in a cryptographically random fashion, if you assume that hash functions mimic a random oracle, not unlike a lottery. Miners are incentivized by txn fees to include a record of valid transfers in the body of their ticket, thus providing a secure way to release new money and facilitate its transfer. Ultimately, this lottery system permits a global read/write database with rate-limited writes, allowing the network time to synchronize and provide higher fairness to the miners.  I'm interested to hear your further criticisms.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:46:20
it seems like a deterministic seed hash is used in the file name, meaning two different wallets using the same seed would overwrite each other on backup. even if they weren't overwriting each other, i'm concerned the channel states would diverge just from being used in separate wallets/applications.
operating the same set of channels across different devices would require explicit synchronization/consensus to ensure the state of both wallets is identical. I didn't see anything in the PR that pointed to such synchronization being in place, but I may have missed it. in general, it is dangerous to use the same seed in multiple, same-seed wallets without such safeguards.
my interpretation of the post was that you could have multiple independent wallets sharing one gdrive, though as mentioned below, the consistency guarantees of gdrive would make this non-trivial, even in the single backup case

We're very close to having an initial conception of a watchtower integrated w/ LND, this has been a major area of research and development over the past few months. Currently, it has been constructed to operate as either a standalone binary, or as part of an existing LND instance.
The towers themselves are very straightforward, and a simple wire protocol has been solidified. The majority of the engineering is happening on the client-side:
 * ensuring that we reliably backup to N replicas
 * managing watchtower peers, collecting reliability metrics
 * renewing/negotiating/bootstrapping sessions with towers
 * per/session HD key derivation to randomize client identifiers
 * support outbound connections via Tor for clients, and inbound connections via hidden services for towers
 * support for private, dedicated watchtowers
 * batching of updates for performance, randomized batch intervals for privacy
 * graceful shutdowns, e.g. flushing all pending backups before allowing the daemon to exit (or be suspended)
 * fault tolerance, fault tolerance, fault tolerance
All of this will happen in the background, such that we never block the live operation of channels. Also need to expose metrics regarding the watchtower client itself so that applications/users can have insight into the current state, progress, or history of their backups.
We'll have a feature branch up fairly soon so that we can start getting eyes. The design and discussion will likely be formalized as a proposed BOLT once we have some real-world testing and analysis (testnet first!).
We've intentionally versioned the watchtower protocol we're working on, meaning an initial version _could_ be rolled out, and later deprecated in favor of the final form of the BOLT. Of note is that the BOLT would predominately pertain to the wire protocol and expected behavior of the peers, which is relatively small compared to the supporting infrastructure required to make the process seamless, reliable, and mobile-ready.

Awesome work! I enjoyed reading the paper :)
I agree that watchtowers can be made more efficient with eltoo, though what information are you referring to that could lose us money if leaked? It seems this would require uploading _my_ commitments, but that isn’t what the watchtower stores in any proposals I’m aware of. 
Typically the watchtower would only store signatures/script data required to spend from the remote party’s revoked commitment. How could leaking this info cause my funds to be lost? Am I missing something?

And to add to that example, it's just like paying in cash at a market. You give the cashier $20, he gives you back $14.50 (assuming your total is $5), and the remaining 50 cents is given to miners as the transaction fee. This fee is implicit given the value of the inputs and outputs, as it is just their difference. 
EDIT: I realize fees aren't normally taken on cash transactions, but they are present on essentially all digital transactions, so for the sake of the example, assume that cash transactions do require a fee. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:33:18
I honestly have no clue as to the exact reason. My best guess is that miners have simply started blocking low fee transactions, which would ultimately aid the "block space is filling up and fees are becoming unreasonable" argument, though take it with a grain of salt because at the end of the day, it's just a guess :)

Everyone does illegal things all the time, whether they realize it or not. It's simply a result of having such an overly complicated legal structure.

No, but evaluating the positive and negative consequences of a design is neither a trivial nor an instantaneous process. Until the community can confidently support one, both, or neither of the proposals, then yes there will be none, that's simply a by product of consensus. 


That argument has been used for over a year, and yet Bitcoin chugs along. Regardless, it seems unlikely that the blockchain's throughput, no matter maximum block size, will be anything but almost completely saturated in the future. Instead of counting the shear number of transactions, we should try to maximize what a single transaction can enable, e.g. LN.


Nope, it's simply the fact that we're not in a dire enough situation to warrant irresponsible action. In the meantime, we will continue to work towards solutions that we can collectively agree upon.

I agree, I found the dependence of ICANN somewhat confusing. 


Yes and no, I have some reservations about the levels of decentralization and security in practice. For example, there are no economic incentives for processing the virtual chain or even ensuring consistency across nodes. The only way to actually verify anything for yourself would be to download the Bitcoin blockchain and process the virtualchain locally. Otherwise, you essentially have to trust blockstack nodes to behave honestly, which seems to violate any real notion of decentralization.

ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. Whenever you spend bitcoins, you must include a signature that approves the spend, which is done using ECDSA. If these signatures can be broken faster than transactions can be confirmed, an attacker could sign a different transaction that spends your coins before the original transaction is ever accepted.

I've thought about this, but that may require a wallet to sign a new transaction if it doesn't get confirmed in the next block. You could extrapolate this, to say that a transaction is valid if it includes the hash of one of the last n blocks, but this still presents a usability and/or scaling constraint. Further, I imagine it would also break (or unnecessarily constraint) the lightning network. 
Perhaps a more general solution would be for each txn to commit to the exact consensus rules it can be processed in. This might require some sort of generalized blockchain framework/architecture, such that the breadth of possible consensus rules can be represented and encoded. However, any alt-coins that do not alter this framework would not be able to spend coins from the preexisting chain, since their transactions would commit to different rules and be handled appropriately. This is more of a shower thought, but would love some feedback

As luke-jr mentioned, a block is deemed an orphan if the client does not know of a parent for said block.  It may be the case that the client finds &amp; downloads the parent later on, filling in the gap.
The case you describe above, where the new block is broadcasted after another successful block, simply means that the new block gets added to the client's database as part of a side chain.  If this new side chain were to then be extended first, it would be swapped out as the new main chain.
Also, the hash of the previous block is stored directly in the header.  The header also contains a Merkle Tree over all the transactions (essentially all information not in the header) that indirectly provides integrity to the entire block.

Maybe if you're an altruist, but not if you're a business man.
If 65% of the hashing power is in China, then 35% is outside.  This means blocks are _twice_ (65/35 ~= 2) as likely to be found inside the firewall.  I'll use the 1-2 min figure for transmitting a 1MB block through the firewall from Toomim's presentation, that is published [here](  Thus during that 1-2 minute interval, China is twice a likely (compared to the rest of the world) to find a block and relay it inside of China before an outside block can cross the firewall.  This huge discrepancy in latency effects every block found by the network, but greatly benefits the larger portion of mining power behind the firewall. If you were a business man, where would you set up shop? :)

It really is, and it's much more complex than I think a lot of us could have ever imagined.  This why it's not a simple black and white question regarding # of txns and what's ultimately led to the long drawn out debate that has unfolded


Perhaps! I'm probably not as well versed to comment on that though, but if the economics are somehow aligned for miners then it's likely inevitable.  The first step is to then align everyone's interests :)

Wouldn't it be better to just build an open source mining client that offered merged mining with multiple cryptocurrencies? Either way, this would have to be first predicated by each of those currencies supporting merged mining in the first place. But part of the reason other currencies don't use SHA256 is because the amount of mining power currently used for Bitcoin could easily overwhelm a less secure currency and could lead to easy double spends.

So we can agree that Blockstack is not SPV compatible? Even if you prune, it's still effectively a full node without the ability to bootstrap others.
Either way, this still requires full Blockstack nodes to download and verify several orders of magnitude more data than necessary, most of which is irrelevant to the virtualchain. In practice, I imagine this inefficiency would constitute a huge centralization pressure that will hinder the overall security of Blockstack.

We don't know a good way of determining payouts for simply running a full node because it's susceptible to Sybil attacks. Should you get paid more if you run 1000 nodes instead of only 1? The bigger problem is that it's hard to determine if you're *actually* running 1000 full nodes or instead running 1 real one and 999 pseudonodes. 
TLDR: mining is the only way we know of protecting against Sybil attacks in the classical sense. Hence, they receive payment that is roughly proportional to the amount of work they put into securing the network. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:24:22
The technical reason is miner centralization. China's internet connection with the rest of the world is pretty terrible as demonstrated here 
If the majority of miners have bad internet, it keeps the rest of the world in the dark about the current state of the blockchain. This effectively amounts to a selfish mining attack that can be blamed on connection speed, since the rest of the world is still downloading while the biggest miners are starting on the next block. This reduces miner profitability for the small guys and drives the status quo towards further centralization.
In summary, from the same video "Most of the rest of the world can handle larger blocks..., China though cannot"
Realistically, ~2MB, mayyyyybe 3MB, is probably about as large as we can go without significant drawbacks in decentralization. So having both as capacity increases isn't feasible yet :/
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:22:21


I'm not saying the debate itself is rushed. But if the debate has been going on for 3 years and we haven't reached a conclusion, then changing a constant and git push -f master is probably not the right answer.  Decentralization is the only thing that truly makes Bitcoin different from any other currency, and increasing the block size is not aligned with that ideal.  
SegWit will roughly double the virtual block size and transaction volume depending on the type of transactions present.  In the meantime, this gives us a chance to implement the real scalability solutions that may not even need a "true" block size increase.  This is probably unlikely, but we don't know for sure.  Who knows what else will be developed by the time we start to max out SegWit blocks, but we have a lot of smart people in the world so I'm optimistic :)

This would be better to help explain how TLS works. The point of a Diffie Hellman key exchange is to arrive at the same key, which enables both sides to perform much faster, *symmetric* cryptography (think AES, stream ciphers, etc).
Currently, asymmetric cryptography is only used in Bitcoin (more specifically, on the blockchain) to perform digital signatures. This proves that the owner of the secret key has agreed to make the transaction, and their public key can be used to verify that statement. 
However, once CT is enabled, we will see Diffie Hellman key exchanges on the blockchain. Before sending a transaction, the sender must perform a non-interactive DH key exchange (mixes his secret with the receiver's public) and for simplicity "encrypt" some data to the receiver. Upon receiving the transaction, the receiver can mix his secret with the senders public and recover the data. Notice that anyone else who tries to do so without the secret is in the same position as Eve in the video, and cannot decrypt the value. The cool part about this is that both parties don't have to be online at the same time, but can still encrypt and decrypt with the appropriate party. Pretty cool stuff :)

First of all, no cryptocurrency is completely trustless—you have to trust that &gt;50% of the hash rate is honest. 


Not really, you basically have to run a full bitcoin node to have any security at all.  Blockstack operations are not validated by the Bitcoin blockchain, thus a basic SPV proof *does not* prove that the operation is accepted in the virtualchain.
Without downloading the entire blockchain, it's impossible to verify which ones are valid. This ambiguity makes it easy for Blockstack full nodes to create alternate histories using operations that are invalid in the virtualchain, but confirmed in the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:29:47

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the extra granularity will give node operators greater flexibility to participate depending on their circumstances.  In the end, the entire argument against a strict block size increase revolves around its impact on miner centralization.  Would this not provide an intermediary option to suit those needs? I see that as a better alternative to only having full verification or no verification at all.

Agree with your analysis. It's definitely not a waste. If we decided to put everyone on the gold standard, we'd have to spend a ton of resources and materials for research, mining, minting, and transferring those gold coins (or some currency backed by it). The laws of physics are what provides security to bitcoin. The process of converting raw energy into digital tokens while simultaneously recording transactions efficiently captures that entire process. Ultimately, the blockchain provides a distributed _timestamped_ server, and expending a lot of energy to secure it is what makes breaking that security either close to impossible or impractical from an economic standpoint because you'd have to recreate Bitcoin's notion of time, which is measured in CPU (but realistically ASIC) cycles.

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:09:18
It isn't fair, and that's exactly why we have to be extremely cautious with our next steps. We can't "trim" hashing power; the miners will always get to decide where to direct the resources they rightfully own.  There are some proposals for economically incentivizing faster block transmission as part of the Bitcoin protocol, but these will not be implemented or ready in the short term.  The root of the problem is that there exists an economic *advantage* for miners in China to have slower internet. Any block size increase, either SW SF or 2MB HF, will make the problem worse. It is a delicate balance that we must all be considerate of until the longer term solutions have time to fully mature.
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:12:08
I understand the rationale for them, but have we tried any simulations/modeling to back these up? We can't seem to decide whether a fixed increase would be beneficial, let alone a self-adjusting one. Regardless, the current Bitcoin protocol is beautiful intersection of economics and cryptography that allows it to be governed by a simple majority. Why are there two phases? If the dynamic blocksize is better, why not use it from the start? 60% is still an arbitrary constant and may be too high or too low, we don't know. Either way, this doesn't seem like an elegant solution to the problem, and that alone worries me.

Some happen to be supported by Core, some by Reddit, some by miners.  All that matters is the one that people end up using.  That is the very essence of a currency owned by the people and to pretend otherwise goes against that principle.
[Edit] To elaborate, the four ideas are:
* The denomination
* The protocol
* The original software implementation, ie bitcoin-core
* The concept of a global currency governed by popular consensus.  This is the one you don't claim belongs here, but where else does it belong? If an altcoin were to gain popular consensus, it would be Bitcoin, irrespective of its name.

There's a difference between home brewing your own cryptographic primitives and creating new applications for existing assumptions. CT exhibits the latter, and is a much much safer option than the first. 
Having studied and implemented CT, I would stand behind it as one of the most novel and beautiful constructions of the decade. If you're interested in some homework, check out the Borromean Ring Signatures white paper.
At its core, CT is simply a highly structured graph of EC-Schnorr signatures. If you believe EC-Schnorr signatures are secure, then you should feel pretty confident in CT. They rely only on the random oracle model, so if you think SHA256d is secure this is nothing new. 
For the more cryptographically savvy, it also relies on EC Pedersen Commitments, which derives its security from the DLP. However, if you didn't have faith in DLP you certainly wouldn't have faith in Bitcoin so it becomes a moot point. 
As others have mentioned, even if it was broken, only privacy would be jeopardized. So at worst is equivalent to the current plaintext Bitcoin transactions.

Sorry, but no.  Miners are independent actors, just as users are.  They don't work for you or anyone else, they can and should do what is in their best interest economically.  They are absolutely permitted to support their position with their opinions and hashing power.  If they deem that what users demand is better for their situation, they will adopt it.  Remember that miners are users of Bitcoin as well.

That's not what he said, he said the rest of the world can handle 8MB but China isn't ready.  Look at the block propagation times from his presentation here 
The median time for moving blocks from China to London is between 60-120 seconds (bottom of the first section).  His live demo in the links from my prior post showed that their bandwith can be as low in 50 kb/s. Latencies should increase linearly with the size of the block. 2-3x increase will likely lead to roughly 3-6 minute propagation times.  This is fast approaching the block interval and jeopardizes both security of the chain and fairness to miners. 8MB is out of the question.

IIRC the the impossibility of the Two Generals problem (and it's generalizations) are for deterministic consensus algorithms. Nakamoto consensus is not only probabilistic in how it admits blocks, but also in finality. In other words, transactions are never 100% confirmed in Bitcoin, though the probability of a reorg decreases exponentially. Most standard consensus protocols require the value to be agreed upon with 100% certainty. In that sense, Bitcoin can be seen as an approximate and practical solution to these problems. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:43:01

They aren't the only ones giving guidance. That's why we held the scaling conferences which included input from many of different invested parties.

@_date: 2016-01-12 23:56:25
You're blind. The sudden push for SegWit stems from the fact that there was more interest from both miners and devs in HK over any of the block size proposals. It's by far the safest option and opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for improving Bitcoin. There are more unknown consequences by rushing into an immediate block increase, scheduled or not, than accepting SegWit as a soft fork. The devs understand this because they've spent thousands of hours understanding trying the problem and said consequences. I know it may hurt some of your feelings, but reading through comments on Reddit doesn't quite grant you the same level of credibility.  The core devs probably want Bitcoin to succeed more than anyone, so accusing them of otherwise is blasphemous. I'd hope that if you similarly put your life's work into something, you'd do your own research and come to your own conclusions instead of just listening to the screams and allegations of children in an echo chamber. If you want to make a change, go do something more useful than making unfounded speculations. Go write some code or present some conclusive research to support your opinion instead of trying to undermine the credibility of people that know what they're doing. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:35:16
Sorry, I think I read this wrong.  You're right, throughput is still proportional to total size. Typical usage will put the effective block size between 1.6x and 2x however it would still be possible to create a 4MB block, see [here](  The primary benefit of SegWit is that only 1MB of data is required to validate a block, while the additional signature validation will be made optional.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:50:26

@_date: 2016-01-13 19:35:17
True, but it also provides more fine grained control of the block verification process. So you can verify the real block, start mining, and then download and verify the witnesses in the background. If those fail, then you can you always ditch the block. But on average, I would argue that this permits a roughly equal block propagation time even though the virtual block size is larger, since the node can be fairly certain the block is valid using the same amount of initial data, eg 1 MB

This is true, but then again most of the invested parties have economic incentives that aren't necessarily aligned with the health of the network.  For miners, bigger blocks =&gt; more txns =&gt; more fees.  Furthermore if you're in China, you get the added benefit of involuntary selfish mining =&gt; more profits.  Other industry players obviously also have an incentive to have more txns, because it means that they're products support more throughput as well.  BUT all of this does come at a cost to the network's health and security. I believe this is the reason SegWit was heavily favored in HK, because it delivered capacity increases as a safe update.


At the round table, that was the only capacity proposal that got consensus from miners and devs. The only other thing that was agreed upon was that more communication was necessary.  I think the push for a 2MB HF has been a powerful indicator to our community that communication is lacking, because I don't think the results of HK were properly disseminated. My hope is that this reality is taken to heart and we can all get back on the same page and move forward as a more integrated community.


SegWit itself had been around for a while, the breakthrough was that we realized it could be done as a soft fork.  That was the part was announced at HK.

Not quite. Mining pools are more cost effective from an operational standpoint because they can increase the amount of electricity consumed without having to scale their bandwith.  At the end of the day, a huge pool has to transmit the same amount of data as a solo miner.  The relative cost of internet vs electricity is very minimal for large pools
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:25:30

Easier said than done. Most miners in China plug right into hydroelectric power plants and AFAIK receive government subsidies for their electricity. Basing our decision off of that would also make us vulnerable to shifts in the global supply and demand of electricity. Who's to say at some point China couldn't make electricity free for miners, they move back, but now we have a block size that their internet can't support? It's not totally crazy given the amount of money Bitcoin is bringing into China. As I've said before, the best solution requires a compromise on *everyone's* part until the long term solutions develop

Bitcoin is a culmination of scientific truths, both economic and cryptographic.  And it is those truths that actively secure the network and provide the very trust users have come to expect from it. 


It can and it has, but this will cease if the majority of its supporters can't be bothered by the scientific method and make decisions simply based on how they feel or entertaining the possibility that correlation != causation.
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:29:35
This can easily be gamed by any party looking to change the status quo. Furthermore, votes should only be counted from mined blocks, since PoW will prevent Sybil attacks. But then we're just back in the same position of having the majority of the hashing power dictating the block size.  I don't think this is a good way to handle dynamic block sizing. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:27:28
It definitely is, I believe the figure is closer to 65%. 


It will continue to be as long as it is economically profitable, and that is outside of Bitcoin's control.  We have to deal with the economic interests of miners and compromise between all parties involved.


To some degree, yes. But as long as the firewall continues to divide &gt;50% the effects of selfish mining attack will favor the miners in China. At the moment, blocks only have to propagate inside the firewall to be accepted by &gt;50% of the network, and there is very little incentive to extend that further. The effects of selfish mining are compounded as the size of your pool grows; there's simply no way for the rest of the world to keep up as latencies grow with such an isolated topology.


Not many, it all boils down to economics at play.  The community is spending a huge amount of effort to provide solutions that align all parties' interest.  The unfortunate truth is that they're not here today, and many will require more research.  Until that time comes, we must provide solutions that balance as many of these competing factors as possible.
EDIT: The factors I'm referring to are scalability, decentralization, security, community, infrastructure etc.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:13:08
It's only good enough because it hasn't been widely exploited. But you can expect that will happen and eventually for much greater sums of money than we see today, whether it was made aware by PT or someone else. 
0-conf is essentially the same thing as leaving cash on someone's doorstep and it will only continue be safe as long as it's not a common practice. If we start telling everyone that this is acceptable and more people do it, it won't take long before someone opens their eyes and makes a living out of it. 
If Coinbase thinks this is an acceptable risk, then more power to them. But I think anyone would laugh at you if you cried about money being stolen off your doorstep..
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:45:51
Quite the opposite. Once a block is propagated to more than 50% of the hashing power, this new chain will be extended faster than any other competing chain. Since 65% of the mining power is behind the great firewall, _the block doesn't even have to leave the country_ before it has become adopted by the majority. Even if a miner outside of China were to find a block while the other is exiting China, the miners inside the firewall would already have at least 1-2 minute head start before the block can even get into China. Since the firewall divides the hash rate into 65/35, this means that miners in China have a 1-2 minute head start roughly 2/3 of the time. Wanna guess what will happen with 2MB? :)
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:06:31

As of right now, mining is most profitable in China due to low energy costs.  Thus a disproportionate number of mining companies have moved their operations there as part of a sound business model.  Furthermore, there is a measurable advantage from having cheap resources and involuntary selfish mining due to bandwith that will continue to make it more profitable than the rest of world.  It may not be the ideal situation, but this is what has and will likely happen for the foreseeable future. We have to consider that miners will act in their own self interest, so our solution must take that into account.

@_date: 2016-01-15 10:25:38
This is totally false.
Bigger blocks give more advantage to bigger miners, squeezing out the small guys. Bigger blocks simulate some level of selfish mining without even having to write code. The problem is that this activity is currently incentivized by only having a single longest chain. In order to work around this, we need solutions that incentivize faster block transmission, eg braided blockchains. This would force China to upgrade their networking capabilities if they don't want to start sharing their profits.

The whole idea of compromising goes against the principles of consensus. With consensus, a change can only be enacted if an overwhelming majority support the proposal. This *protects* the interest of minorities. A compromise more or less implies that large parties are sacrificing in one area in order to advance their own agenda. Say users were split 50/50,  now each proposal is only supported by 50% and abhorred by 50%, but no where near consensus-level support. This allows large interest groups to route around minorities, by enabling the porkbarreling of otherwise subpar proposals. If you want an idea of what happens after many iterations of compromise, look at our governments. Until we reach consensus, we do nothing. I imagine that if the situation were dire enough, action would be taken. But the market is clearly demonstrating that it doesn't necessarily need either proposal right now. 
TLDR; a good proposal shouldn't require a compromise. compromise is bad for consensus.

I think we agree on how these discrepancies are eventually resolved.  
But my original point was that miners are not slaves to Bitcoin's users. They are an important part of the system whose economic incentives help to balance other party's interests from swinging to far through a system of checks and balances.  In this case, if miners show support for either Core or Classic it is likely because they see those changes as advantageous to their company's survival and profitability. Changes to Bitcoin should only be allowed to happen when there is rough consensus among _all_ active parties.  This includes users, miners, and devs; and no single group's say should be allowed to completely overrule another.

Totally agree.  But 0-conf isn't even remotely close to being good enough, in fact it's the exact opposite.  I honestly think it's more important to show the world that 0-conf is not secure.  By offering it as a service, every other company in the space now has to offer it in order to compete with Coinbase.  How much faith do you *really* think the public will have in Bitcoin if the industry itself is using it improperly?  Until we have the technology, it's irresponsible to pretend as if it is "good enough" and is just false advertising.  If Coinbase is wishes to offer 0-conf, then they are *fully aware of the risks* and shouldn't have the right to cry about it.  This [comment]( is semi-relevant

It's not about Chinese miners keeping up, it's about the world keeping up with China. China has ~65% of the hashing power. They could go offline, mine for days, and then reintroduce all the blocks they find to the network and override all the transactions that happened in the rest of the world.  This is the worry behind selfish mining attacks, and increased block sizes =&gt; increased latencies =&gt; some level of selfish mining occurs with every block that is found.

I agree with most of what you said, but at that conference the miners also indicated they trust the core devs to implement what they deem to be the best option, since the devs also understand the problem better than anyone. I'm not totally opposed to an increase, and as you said 2MB is better than doing nothing. But I'm also not convinced that anyone, devs included but especially the public, is 100% certain of the repercussions that block size will have on the network. Which ultimately is what makes me tentative to fully support any of the block size proposals outright. But it looks like we might find out..
As for the economics you discussed, I can't pretend to know much about that so I'll hold my tongue :)

I don't refute that, but there are definitely software decisions that will make it worse.  I think we can all agree on that.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:10:57
I wouldn't say it stops being a problem but it would definitely help.  Even 40% would still be a considerable portion of the network that suffers from extreme isolation.  When modeling bitcoin in terms of distributed algorithms, all known/proven models rely on reasonable levels of synchronization.  The network's properties quickly degrade as block propagation time moves closer towards block interval time
Edit: I think we'd likely see the reverse problem, where the rest of the world is able to outpace China. This could be arguably better in some regards, but not for miner profits as a function of energy costs.

Even if it was a crime, the world's governments will have collapsed by the time his case is tried. 
Regardless—welcome to the world of cryptography! You have to assume the adversary has unlimited power, including the ability to send two measly transactions. This is 100% Coinbase's problem and a risk they knowingly took by misusing Bitcoin. If you encrypt some sensitive data with a reused OTP and it gets stolen, would you complain to the government? No, because you misused the cryptosystem and it would be your fault. The only thing the government should do is laugh at you for even proposing the idea. 
Bitcoin will protect you if you use it properly. Stop giving governments more reason to meddle with something they will never understand or control.

If the amounts are encrypted, the blockchain must have an alternative way for proving that the inflation schedule is not being altered. One proposed solution to this is Confidential Transactions (CT): 
CT allows the outputs amounts to be encrypted, and supports proofs that _sum inputs = sum outputs + fee_. The important part here is that it it proves the transaction does not alter the total supply of money. Fees are provided in plaintext so that miners can collect and aggregate them. 
Using this, the only inputs that could otherwise be plaintext are the coinbase transactions. You could theoretically encrypt these as well, and prove that they contain an amount equal to the expected block reward.  However since the value of the coinbase output is deterministic, a valid proof necessarily gives away the encrypted amount, and so its more efficient just to ignore this. 
Using this sort of system, we can guarantee that miners are accurately following the inflation schedule, and, by the construction CT, prove that all valid transactions are not altering the monetary supply. Pretty cool stuff, this as already been implemented on Elements. IIRC MimbleWimble uses the same/similar mechanism for enabling private outputs.
Only real downside is larger txs (mostly signatures) and more verification, but tons of optimizations have been explored in making this practical. Really hoping we get to see this stuff used in practice someday, as it represents a big win for privacy and fungibility. Hope this was helpful :)

Miners shouldn't earn a reward if they find a solution for an invalid block, which means they are incentivized to validate anyway, no? If miners don't validate blocks before mining, it seems like their hashing power could easily be manipulated by an attacker to mine on an invalid chain.

there are a couple of different ways you could do price discovery. if the participants are aware of each other, they can communicate an agreed upon price out of band. another alternative is just to reuse existing pricing feeds from exchanges, and use that to spot the exchange rate. ideally, we'd be able to find a completely decentralized discovery mechanism that can withstand adversarial conditions, though this last option will probably require a fair bit of research

The evidence presented seems to show that the chips support both modes, though the miners shipped to consumers come with non-Asicboost software. Even if they switched to non-Asicboost software, Bitmain would have the same hash rate, but start paying 42% more for electricity. 42% was calculated given that Asicboost provides a 30% reduction in energy, so 1/0.7 = 1.42

Ideally, the properties of a currency should be hard to change.  Sure, some of them are certainly less controversial, maybe even "harmless".  But decisions regarding the protocol should at least _strive_ for consensus.  The final decision can obviously be made with only a simple majority, but consensus is designed to protect the interests of _all_ parties. In my opinion, minimizing the number of parties who are not forced into a new system with different properties is important for the health of the community and long term value of Bitcoin.  
There may come a time when you're not in the majority.  I know I'd feel a lot more comfortable if my money was managed by a slow judge that _always_ makes beneficial verdicts for all parties than a hasty one that may not always be aligned with my interests.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:49:22
It doesn't need to be demonstrated, we have logic. What you're saying is that every full node can/will be able to validate all of the world's transactions during a 10 minute interval. Let's disregard that the time to verify a block should be extremely quick, otherwise miners would spend the whole 10 minute interval verifying before they can _safely_ decide to extend that block. But whatever, we'll use 10 minutes as an relaxed upper bound. 
At some point we will hit a limit to verifying transactions. If you want the network to handle 2000/s, you also have to validate at least at that speed.  2000/s is achievable on moderately powerful desktops (and secp256k1 improvements help), but taking 10 minutes to verify a block erodes the security properties from the underlying consensus protocol. The security of the Bitcoin protocol [drops dramatically]( as block propagation + block verification time approaches the block interval. This also doesn't take into account network spikes, but let's do a little more math to arrive at something more conclusive. 
Technically, verification it has to be done even faster because of block propagation, which we'll say is 15s for 1MB on [average]( which is conservative given the sustained growth in block size.
To handle 2000/s, we'd need 2000 txns/s * 600 s/block =1,200,000 txns/block. At [600 bytes/txn]( the block size would have to be 720MB. Propagation scales linearly with block size, so propagating a block now takes 15 s/MB * 720 MB = 3 hours. I'll even ignore the storage requirements for storing that every 10 minutes...
Either way, we need a way to reduce these figures so that they take a small amount of time compared to the block interval. Let's shoot for 30 seconds, 15s for propagation and 15s for validation. 
For block propagation alone, we'd need a 720x improvement, and this needs to adopted by a significant majority of the network. This just doesn't seem possible in the time frame we all have for Bitcoin.
Furthermore, trying to verify all those transactions in 15s means a 40x improvement in verification; again this just isn't reasonable in our time frame if we're looking for a scalability now. 
None of this accounts for peak traffic or myriad of other concerns. But these numbers demonstrate the inefficiencies of forcing _all_ nodes to validate _all_ transactions, which is inherent to the original design outlined in the paper. If you don't care about centralization, then sure Bitcoin scales; cough cough, Mike Hearn and R3 are building this. 
This is why the Lightning network is so critical to the scalability roadmap. We can get a nearly infinite number of transactions since the majority of them will never hit the blockchain. 
Essentially, LN locks funds between any two given parties. Once that happens, the network doesn't care about their intermediate transactions, since they have no effect on anyone else. Nodes only have to validate one more transaction when the channel is closed, since these funds are released and can now be sent to any party. 
Irregardless of whether blockchains can actually scale, which they don't, decentralization is what makes Bitcoin special. LN gives us nearly instant transactions and less burden on full nodes. It's a win win for safely maintaining decentralization while providing better scalability and usability. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 19:50:48

Memory hard PoW is just a bandaid for the real problem.  ASICs are _good_ for Bitcoin mining, they give us greater security at less total cost.  Economic incentives will always drive mining towards ASICs, and designing an ASIC resistant PoW just means that the disparity between those with and without ASICs will be even greater once one is developed.  The simpler the PoW algorithm, the easier and cheaper it will be to develop open source, or at least widely available, ASICs for the general public's use. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 20:55:23
LN doesn't prevent you from sending an ordinary Bitcoin transaction, so if you are unhappy with the who you're being routed through that's always an option. And they'll be relatively cheaper since the majority of transactions will never hit blockchain, so there'd likely be less demand per capita for block space.

In addition to the ever-growing anonymity set, doesn't signing in ZC also require a of couple minutes to generate the SNARK circuits?

If so, it could certainly be a barrier for mobile devices or other underpowered systems
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:31:14
AFAIK, Zerocash proofs will be smaller and verify faster than CT. However, CT doesn't rely on any new cryptographic primitives, it's essentially a just complex Schnorr signature. Zerocash relies on ZK-SNARKs, which have yet to withstand decades of scrutiny. So the biggest benefit of CT over Zerocash is that it can be done with cryptography that is well-understood to be secure at this point in time.

Cool.. but there are currently gaping holes in the proposal, some of which don't seem to have solid solutions. Being willing to fix the issues doesn't mean much if there is no solution. 


No they're not, if a full node doesn't verify the extension blocks then it's essentially an SPV node. Enabling extension blocks forces full nodes to have to verify more transactions—not validating them poses serious risks to the node. 


You're right, the tech as it stands isn't ready, so it won't be activated any time soon. The thing I'm more concerned about is where you get your information.

It doesn’t even need to be your own P2WPKH output, you can feed any txid in mempool and wait until it has the appropriate number of confirmations. If the scriptpubkey is not verified an attacker can costly open thousands of invalid channels per block—without moving or having any coins.
If the scriptpubkey is being verified but the amount isn’t, the attacker must have _some_ coins and create real funding outputs (with value &lt;&lt; capacity), which greatly slows down the attack and adds a tangible cost, but still bad.

That's not true at all, it will also require developing a new version of the peer-to-peer network and codepaths that are activated in response to signaling a new bit.

Regardless of flaws, your advertising is terribly misleading. 
The big checklist on your website claims that BigChainDB is immutable. I would love to hear your opinions on what gives Bitcoin its immutability and how you think your product delivers those. Blockchains on their own—aka hashed linked lists—are not immutable, even after being deployed in a distributed setting. Ideally, it'd be great if your engineers could sketch out a proof of immutability and what assumptions must hold to deliver on that claim to which you've convinced investors, users, and ultimately yourselves. My intuition says that the "immutability" claim is very weak and relies on some otherwise unrealistic assumptions.
EDIT: I read through the whitepaper, it seems that the authors confuse the definitions of tamper-resistance and immutability.  The paper essentially argues that immutability is provided by hashing everything and including the hash of the previous block.  Thus, changing any previous entry invalidates all forward blocks.  This does satisfy the definition of tamper resistance, but is not immutable. Bitcoin's strong, but in no way absolute, immutability is maintained by the laws of physics (Proof of Work), replication across mutually distrusting parties, and economic incentives to achieve correctness. All three of these work in concert to provide immutability, and removing any one (and possibly other features that aren't coming to mind) ultimately destroys the immutability property. BigChainDB does not seem to satisfy *any* of these points.  Please correct me if I missed something.

On what planet do you live where blocking technical progress for personal profit is not considered fucking people? It sounds nice there..
Wake up man, we have consensus on SegWit, just not how to deploy it. UASF is our best option at this point.

Bitcoin is actually fairly green in terms of where it get power.  The majority of mining operations already get their energy from renewal energy sources, such as hydroelectric dams.
I believe there's a talk by Andreas (IIRC) where he mentions that China opens a new power plant every 16 hours. In order to handle China's population growth, these plants can output way more than their current consumption requires.  Since the plants are typically built in remote areas, they have no way of selling this power back to the major urban areas, and so it goes to waste.
Enter bitcoin! To run a mine, all you need is electricity and an internet connection.  There are no in-store customers or distribution centers, so geographic location isn't too big of a consideration.  The reality is, there aren't many industries that can so readily make use of this excess energy.  As the world continues its push for renewable energy, there will likely be many such cases of hyperlocalized electricty surplus, allowing miners to form a healthy secondary market for cheap electricity.
It always amuses me, then, to think about the costs of securing the dollar.  When you consider the true costs of: owning and operating physical branches/offices, paying and feeding humans (including their vacations), air conditioning, vaults, armored trucks, police escorts or supervision, printing presses, paper, metals, theft insurance, congressional discussions, the full force of the united states
 military—this list goes on. And we haven't even gotten into the legal costs dealing with misbehavior, or the fact that we have to pay taxes and support the IRS in order to keep the whole system running! It's tough to make an accurate comparison regarding the total amount of energy consumed by both, but bitcoin is certainly greener in every way than what we have now.
tldr; Miners can be flexible in finding the cheapest electricity, which currently is coming from green sources experiencing overproduction.  So although bitcoin consume a lot of raw energy, most of that energy is green, and would otherwise go to waste.  It's not about how much energy bitcoin consumes, but about what energy it's consuming.

Each header commits to a merkle root of all the transactions in that block. To prove a transaction has been confirmed, your full node can then provide a merkle branch to the transaction, which you can verify using the header at the appropriate height.

IMO having multiple implementations is not a good thing. Consensus is of utmost importance, and even slight deviations in behavior could cause the network to split. The whole BIP process is designed to ensure that all changes made to the code base are throughly reviewed. Spreading this requirement across multiple code bases then requires intimate knowledge of all relevant code bases to properly ensure compatibility. Peer review sucks, why replicate it n times?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:03:10


It's also a great way of underhandedly enlightening people of their own hypocrisy. :)


By that logic, we shouldn't have fixed the _original_ rule that allowed miners to allocate more than 21 million coins, no? Just as in that case, we have discovered a critical security vulnerability that jeopardizes the guarantees of the system, and it should be promptly fixed. Anyone standing in the way of those updates is fucking other people—and no amount of spin can change that. Even if those participants weren't actively fucking people, they are allowing exploits to perpetuate which could be used to fuck people. Both situations are intolerable. 


Lol, okay dad. Trust me, I can handle the real world in stride. But that's because in the real world I don't allow myself to continue getting fucked once I realize I'm getting the shit end of the stick. I'm also not sure you're qualified to give that advice, seeing as your world seems okay with continuing to get boned until the end of time. 


That agreement is hardly consensus, it will not be feasible in the provided time frame and is less safe than the option we already have in front of us. Nearly every signatory on that list is in either Bitmain or DCG's portfolio. To think those signatures represent the true, unadulterated opinion of those companies is naive. 


At this point, activating segwit seems unlikely using any method other than a UASF. I don't consider the current "proposal" as a method because there is no code or testing and probably won't be done by their deadline anyway. Truthfully, I was initially opposed at the idea of a UASF out of considerations for safety. Normally, I would error on the side of patience in the hopes of better safety, however I have since been convinced that these risks are much less than I originally anticipated and overall manageable. 
Moreover, I am genuinely concerned about the decentralization of the network if honest miners cannot be profitable when up against ASICBOOST. The longer we continue to _let ourselves get fucked_, the harder it will be to resolve these security vulnerabilities as more mining power is concentrated in fewer hands. I refuse to let this situation escalate any further and so support BIP148. 


Yawn. Plus there's no way you can attack the UASF chain without increasing its hashing power. Even if the legacy chain continues exists, it won't need your hash rate because it would require large miner support to begin with. Good luck!

Holding cryptocurrencies is very different than holding any other asset.  As such, it is important for users to be fully aware of what the system can and cannot protect against.  I think it would be a shame to not educate newcomers on these points, only for them to later feel cheated by a system that did not live up to their expectations. These situations are avoidable, but only if users are aware, encouraged, and informed of how to protect their assets against them.

I would imagine that Satoshi has a better understanding of basic ZKPoK. The verifier should be able to request a response to an arbitrary number of challenges in order to satisfy their level of paranoia. If he really wanted to prove his identity to the world, he should know that one signature is not sufficient.

Agreed, it also breaks the mechanism design that secures proof of work. The fact that multiple non-obvious optimizations exist means that there likely doesn't exist a dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) action profile. This is further compounded by the fact that ASICBOOST is patented in two countries. Even if there was a DSIC action profile that used some version of ASICBOOST, the possibility of legal recourse implies that the true cost of using a particular strategy may be more than simply the electricity used for mining. Moreover, this additional cost can be triggered by the actions of other participants, which breaks the most basic definition of a dominant strategy.

His point is that even if some users exit into another currency, there must have been someone who was willing to buy the original. Whether an individual hodls or liquidates doesn't change the number of coins in circulation, it only changes the supply/demand, and therefore price.

Thank you for that. 
Favoring an underengineered solution that doesn't address the negative consequences of said solution is also reckless. Simply increasing the block size without addressing quadratic sighashing, initial sync times, or UTXO bloat will lead to a degradation in user experience, client robustness, performance, and security. 
The changes that segwit presents will be necessary at one point or another, e.g. the above issues, transaction malleability, script versioning, etc. 
Having actually played around with the SegWit code, it's not that complicated, and many wallets have already finished or are in the process of integrating. Rmember that SegWit is opt-in, especially at the wallet level, so it is not required that they make API changes until it suits them.  Furthermore, SegWit greatly reduces the negative consequences of simply "changing the constant"; in fact, it makes this change much safer in the future.
The question comes down to: is it more reckless to implement safeguards, and then change the constant; or, to change the constant, and pray that the safeguards are activated before the negative consequences arrive?
If your money was on the line, which I assume it is by nature being in this sub, game theory would suggest you pick the first option.  This prevents you from reaching the worst case outcome, which happens if option 2 goes poorly. Unless you're a gambler, of course, in which case, I ask sincerely that you don't gamble with everyone else's stash of decentralized financial freedom.

The hash rate has nearly 4x'd in a year.
Even if only 25-30% of the hash power follows the UASF chain, this will only make a difference if your mining setup was relevant a year ago.
