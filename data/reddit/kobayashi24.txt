How many BTC did you have on gox before the BTC withdrawals got closed?
I don't know, it seems like everybody who bought 50 coins at $100 feels entitled now to 50 real coins, even though they could have never gotten so many coins on a real market for the same price.
Not trying to put you down or anything, just curious if the BTC amount you (and other people) on gox had were the result of the dump or were obtained at real market price before BTC withdrawals closing.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:57:41
I really don't think the individual limits will be much of a problem for them.
I suspect they will handle BTC cashout from now on like the fiat cashouts, they will have to be manually approved first and they process them as they see fit, very slowly, to give them some more time to survive and build up a bankroll.
So your idea won't work in such a case, as they will plan to allow X amount of BTC to go out per day (which they probably won't admit, nor tell us how much that is), regardless of the total withdrawal demand.

I don't want anything from you, so my identity is obviously way less relevant than yours.
If you want to help Will, make him post his own BTC address on his facebook.
Don't you get that everyone can just link to sob stories and post their own BTC address? It's the oldest scam in the book, so if you're legit why not set yourself apart and make sure people see it's legit (by posting on official pages from verified identities, i.e. his facebook, etc.).

@_date: 2014-03-04 22:45:47
While I agree that it's good to follow up on this and ask for explanation and have bitstamp find out why this happened to fix it. However you sound a little like you are ready to get the pitchforks out and to compare bitstamp with gox, even while it was still running, is quite unfair to them at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:21:07
It does not say 501k BTC are missing. It says they should owe 501k BTC, but the balances are given as 950k BTC. 
Where those additional BTC in the balance books came from (note, these were never real BTC on the blockchain) I explain in the link I posted.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:28:06
No, since the total BTC never change by just that, since every transaction has a taker of BTC and a giver of BTC. The sum of all the giving and taking is always 0, thus the total BTC balance is always the amount deposited.
The same goes for fiat. The only thing that can get taken out should be fees (and that can only lead to a decrease of balance).
The only way to mess with those balance otherwise would be if Gox themselves traded against their own account (not part of normal user accounts, i.e. if gox sells a BTC (again, just a number on their side, not a real BTC on the blockchain) and receives fiat for it, the total of BTC in Gox's useraccounts goes up, while the fiat balance of the user's (and thus fiat liabilities) decreases.

Are you sure you were on btc-e.com ?
Are you sure the email exchange was with the real btc-e.com emailaddress ?
All this points to you being on a fishing site or somehow virus infected so that it redirected you to a fishing site.

Yes first time poster with a 1995-looking danish website. I will send you all my BTC without doubt it will reach a good cause.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:23:53
This read like written by a 12 year old.
The only criticism I could take from this was that the minimum cashout amount is 0.01 BTC. While I don't think it's necessary, who really cares about a ~$6 minimum cashout amount? Bitcoin already lets you trade way lower amounts than any other market, it should not be hard to manage your account in a way that there won't be these small leftovers.
The other points raised might be valid, I don't know. There is not a single example for cashout or trade fees given, so I couldn't know from this article if they are reasonable or not. Very poor article.
(I am not defending cryptsy, in fact I am staying clear of them, but this article is just poorly written in a very non-convincing manner without any precise complains, just whining.)

So, I suppose that hints that [I was right]( in that Gox sold non existing coins to hide fiat they owed.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:38:13
Just relying on that can induce a false sense of security, just recently the pony trojan targeted and succesfully stole BTC from Mac users and a few days ago there was [this]( report about a Linux vulnerability.
It's always better to be careful, regardless of the OS, and especially in @_date: 2014-03-07 20:08:02
It is technically possible, but I believe it to be a bad idea.

I think this has been brought up and it was determined this is a tumbler wallet that has nothing to do with gox.

I just realized somebody posted a way more complete theory, ending in my theory, a couple of hours before me.

ok, that was pretty funny
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:06:22
Even if we assume it is true about the lost coins, in the end the coins are not gone, just not with gox, they are still on the market

It was $50 for just minutes. You picked non comparable points.
Either 2013 DDoS $266-&gt;$125, 2014: Site gone $650-&gt;$570
Or      2013 DDoS $266-&gt;$50, 2014: Site gone $650-&gt;$400
would be more accurate
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:03:53
I don't know what you are actually trying to do, cause if you wanna move bitcoins you can just send them somewhere over the blockchain.
If you somehow wanna use email, the safest way would probably to put the wallet.dat of bitcoin-qt-wallet (with that you don't need to know private keys for access to the coins) in a small enrypted container (with e.g. truecrypt) and email it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:07:13
What's even stopping them from stopping the trading during the crash, while looking at the order books (seeing alot of shorts that want to close immediately after bitfinex comes back online), and buy up "cheap" btc from stamp (price rises), resume trading, and effectively sell those cheap bitcoin to the people shorting that now want to close their positions for fear of bitfinex going to pause mode again. 
That atleast was my dark thought, when they said "our Bitstamp BTC reserves were low when we halted trading".
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:55:53


Yes, exactly like this. They know that once it goes through the legal channels, those channels will know more about what to do with fiat liabilities than with Bitcoin. And they can also explain missing Bitcoin by "hacks" or bugs way easier than fiat they dipped their fingers in. They'd much rather owe a huge amount of "lost" Bitcoin, than a huge amount of actual fiat money, so their goal was to minimize the amount of fiat owed (or even try to bridge the gap completely, which they did not succeed in) and not care really about the additional Bitcoin they put in user's account, as they would just get filed under lost or stolen later on.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:11:46
Well, we know they are missing $30m from what they should have.
So what's this "should have" here? Yes, of course the printed balances of Mt.Gox user accounts. In actuallity this "should have"-amount should actually be all the actual user fiat deposits minus all actual user fiat withdrawals (minus trade fees). 
Since there is money missing already, it will be interesting to see where that investigation leads on that front, but it's safe to say right now the "should have"-amount was not calculated by paper trail actual bank deposits, but what was written as fiat in user's accounts, and which I theorize is alot less than the actual banking fiat balance empty.Gox should have.
Even if the actual bank transfer net totals at (let's say again) $150m, but right now Gox collvetive user account's fiat just have $60m in them, then people will think they are actually just owed $60m in fiat (and the rest in Bitcoin, which they now should write off as a loss since they got "lost")
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:42:12
If you sell 1BTC for $1 on bitstamp, it will take the highest bid, e.g. $666, instead of skipping all the ones from $666 to $1.01 to match with the one who has bid for $1.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:15:43
How many bitcoins did you have on Gox before their BTC withdrawal troubles started?
Did you trade up your BTC value once the price was so low?
How much did you initially invest to get your 65BTC ?
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:22:56
This hack can only be used from one computer, to protect their hard work....
Those thiefs are very concearned about being stolen from. I am sure all the BTC they steal are not the product of hard work. Gotta love the hypocracy some people live with.

30.00000000	GOX for 	0.09010100 	฿ ea.
Just means you can buy up to 30 Goxcoins for 0.09 real BTC (for each individual goxcoin, so 30 times 0.09 if you want to buy the whole order, which you don't have to)
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:13:12


Not so sure about that. I highly suspect gox was dumping "fake coins" on there, so people buy them and their total fiat liabilities go down.
I wrote about that some [here](
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:58:18
No, I did not understand it. I was being sarcastic.
But you failed to comprehend that, so I guess it's true what you say :)

Just 5 minutes ago there was a 1200 buy wall on bitstamp. It got eaten into a little (less than 100 BTC I think) and then got removed. 
Just one example why the order book is not a very compelling indicator for buy or sell decisions. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:17:04
I have not read up on this or the proposed solutions, but my first thought to a solution would be that each person can set a limit of how much GB they want of the blockchain and the program just gives you random parts of it. The whole thing would then still exist many many times over in the whole world, just not as one in one place (or rarely in one place).
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:44:26
This is, sadly, much too common nowadays. An outsider makes a critical observation (even constructive), but the ego of the people in charge can't accept outside ideas, nor any fault of their own and feel like the outside helper is actually an intruder.
Such a childish attitude to have and most certainly bad business practise/bad interaction with the user community.
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:53:54
I'd love something like that.
E.g. I like watching youtube and I would like to support the content creators on there. But the ads are just so annoying that I have adblock on (I have it disabled on reddit cause the ads are not so annoying here). If I had the option to pay $10 or so a month and it just gets split up between content creators in the proportions that I watched them, I wouldn't feel like a dick for not wanting to see those annoying ads.
I have often thought about this and youtube could implement it for their own service.
That's why I really like your idea, it basically expands that thought I had for a while to the whole internet and the content we watch and therefore might want to support.
So yeah, great idea, Bitcoin is perfect for something like that.
