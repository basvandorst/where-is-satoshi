Nope, back to screaming about Coinbase supporting segwit as before.

Because Coinbase (the company that owns and operates GDAX) is kind enough to pay those fees on your behalf.

No, stop.

Easier said than done.

There exist many competitors. The reasons Coinbase is winning are:
1) Turns out it's hard to do what they do
2) They really are better at it than their competitors
I don't understand how the regulatory barrier helps Coinbase at all. Shouldn't every US exchange be on the exact same level wregulation?

In the past year they scaled transaction capacity by 7,700% and support capability 887%. Maybe one company just can't do everything at once.

I'm not one to shill or plug, but I'm rather bullish on 0x and the ERC20 ecosystem for this reason.
Seems like Ethereum is leading the charge to true decentralization.

Coinbase is winning because:
1) Never been hacked, leading the industry in security.
2) Reputable in the eyes of regulators and traditional financial institutions, which means they aren't going to be shut down by the US government for failure to comply with KYC/AML or enabling tax fraud.
3) Their talented designers and frontend engineers have created an easy-to-use, multi-platform UI that instills trust and confidence in normal people.
4) USD and EUR rails that usually work, which means they have managed to form and maintain banking relationships.
5) Being the frontrunner in their competitive landscape means they have secured a large amount of capital investment on good terms.

They are prioritizing keeping the site up and support.

I've made a horrible mistake.

Coinbase does not support 2FA over email.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:31:18
That isn't 2FA, that's device verification.

I will never not upvote this video.
