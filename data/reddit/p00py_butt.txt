You have to understand to imagine yourself explaining a dollar to your parents after their entire lives of only bartering. It is just one of those things that's going to take time. So you hunker down and hustle do your thing take that energy and get a second job and get more crypto.

Shorts simply mean a bet against the stock. A short wants the stock to go down. So if it goes up you owe money. And the thing is you can wind up owing a fuck load. Don't short unless you are smart and even then you could get fucked. 
For example a wise short may be to short gamestop its antiquated business that is likely to go out of business.

Ever have a time where paypal stops your transaction or just randomly freezes your accounts its cause they have all the control. They are the middle man. In bitcoin there isn't really a middle man to STOP halt or SEIZE your assets.

I totally believe this. After watching DataDash for a couple years now I can  pretty comfortably say that most of the TA is just bs. There is so much data a different tools that you can use you can pretty much say anything and have the data support you.
