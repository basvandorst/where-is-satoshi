correct answer, rather than let the whole system collapse banks will inflate debts away. likely we'll be getting helicopter money, you'll see it used in japan first.
plan to dump my bitcoin sometime next year at $3000+.

i'm sure he has a small positron, but don't go hating the guy for not being a bitcoin bug too, he's got a decent media personality thing going  (one that actually somewhat trustworthy), bitcoins still too new to get too radical about. gold is better for investment just
for tradition/simplicities sake, bitcoins just got more volatility/upside potential.

I wonder if coinbase has interest in dealing with altcoins? Digitalcoin is a good one, seeing as Blockr already hosts it.. one can hope..

because they cannot beat it :p at most they'd have to control the network through buying out mining centers. might give them a bad name if they even tried.

it slowly erodes away as banks take a percentage of your deposit as a kind of management fee.
they'd prefer to save their asses by banning all cash/bitcoin thus locking your wealth into their system, from which they can inflate their bad debts away without having to worry about the wealth backing said debt (your money) from withdrawing and moving elsewhere.
tl;dr if you don't already own some hard physical assets like gold/silver, physical cash on hand or cryprocurrency, you really should.

the main issues from 2008 still exist, namely the system needs constant growth to justify continued loan-making. if loans can't be made the system freezes.
the amount of counterparty risk today is far larger than it was in 08 and any jump in defaults can trigger systemic collapse.
this is by design. from the perspective of creating stable, consensual markets I'd say the central banks are failing miserably. however, from the perspective of strongarming entire economies to be increasingly dependant on a small, mostly private and unaccountable institution, it's an incredible success.

ultimately bitcoin will fall under the same regulations as the banks. nothing you can do about it besides moving jurisdiction.

well move enough money and that civil disobedience becomes a serious offense that'll land you in jail with your bank account frozen. sorry but they win.

I'm glad they're selling them, I don't want the gov't to hold any BTC.
Are they holding any for themselves or what?
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:27:45
yeah thats more accurate, obviously bitcoin is borderless so.. yeah. they're not gonna leave it be in any case.

push it publicly so people are aware of it, pump the price, cash out on fomo purchases.
it'll be a pump n dump for the ages.
