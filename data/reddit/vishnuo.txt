The decentralization aspect is usually meant in regards to the technology, eg. globally distributed nodes, no central database, etc. The wealth centralisation is a separate issue that usually ends the same in any system \(a small percentage holds the majority of the wealth\)

You can check for instance [blockchain.info]( to view Bitmain's share of the hashrate on the Bitcoin \(BTC\) network \(antpool and btc.com\) \-\&gt; currently around 42&amp; So even on Bitcoin, Bitmain controls a very significant amount of hashpower. This company certainly is a centralising problem, but the competition is not sleeping and new producers and mining farms keep popping up.
I would guess bitmain controls the majority of the hashrate on Bitcoin Cash since they also own at least 2,5&amp; of all BCH and are also burning parts of their mining fees \(presumably to increase the price.\)

Every exchange handles this differently. Some put users' funds in individual addresses, which would make it near impossible to find out for you. Others combine them in (known) hot/cold addresses, these you could easily find out by following your transactions
This, for instance, is the Bitfinex cold wallet address: 
There are services that can help you identify owners of addresses. Matbea, for instance, claims to know the owners of more than 87 million Bitcoin addresses:

How about focus on people's skills, work, accomplishments, etc. and not on their gender, skin colour, or other bodily features?
Edit: OP, I just want to make clear that I don't want to criticise your article. I just have enough of this endless categorising of people based on physical criteria they are born with. These things should really be irrelevant to blockchain technology. Bitcoin does not care whether you are male, female, black, white, a horse or an extraterrestrial... your transaction will be broadcast and if you provide solid code you can contribute.

Ok if you really believe there are inherent thought process differences between men and women (especially this specific) you really need to meet more people.

@_date: 2018-03-24 23:16:18
No, but you could make an account on the exchanges you are interested in, then make a deposit and track where your coins end up

Honestly why should we focus on people's genitals? Is it relevant to have a fair balance of skin color, natural hair color, eye color, height and other physical characteristics as well? What does this have to do with technology? What's next, strong redheads in crypto? Strong short people in crypto? Strong green-eyed people in crypto?
If the work is great it is irrelevant if it was done by a man or a woman.

@_date: 2018-03-14 22:51:40
OK but can it also empower redheads? What about black people? People with green eyes? Can it also empower short people? 
Let's stop this trend of dividing and categorising people based on their skin color, gender, etc. Blockchain is a powerful tool for everybody! How about that?
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:46:19
Unfortunately nothing. Same thing could be going on with Tether. I have deepest respect for the Bitcoiners who early on realised that their BTC are worth more than fiat, regardless of momentary valuation. There have from the very beginning been hardheaded supporters in this space who would not sell their BTC for fiat easily. The more BTC is in determined hands the harder it will be for fiat (or altcoin) printers to acquire a sizeable amount.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:17:05
It really is a problem. People who deny this have absolutely no clue what they are talking about and their intentions to silence this discussion should be seriously questioned.
There is a single company that prints what is used as USD on a lot of exchanges. This is supposed to be backed by real USD, although there is no concrete proof for it. With this printed USD enormous amounts of Bitcoin and other tokens have been bought. So this company could be in possession of a significant part of Bitcoin's supply. If they really have these billions of dollars and also had the respective amounts at each point in the past, then everything is acceptable. But if their scheme is fraudulent it could turn out to be devastating for Bitcoin and the whole crypto market.

The only relevant proof for a claim of ownership of BTC is to sign a message with the private key of the corresponding address.

What I don't get is why there are already fees, since miners are more than enough compensated through the block reward. I understand that fees will be necessary once the block reward approaches 0, but why are we paying miners extra money now?

I don't think he is Satoshi but you are wrong. If you believe his story, he claims that Satoshi was a team of three people: himself, dave kleiman and another person. So speaking of the entity Satoshi in the third person is not revealing.

Nobody can predict the price, not even Bitmain (except maybe very short term). So there is no point at which anyone could know with certainty that the price will rise to ridiculous heights or drop closer to mining costs. What makes sense for miners is to purchase futures to ensure their profit.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:26:47
Why? Any comment on the rest, or are you for the quick silencing of this discussion? If so please elaborate.

When will the circulation of this fake news finally stop?
16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk is Bittrex cold wallet address as far as I know. So this would mean somebody **withdrew** this amount from Bittrex. Also there is **no connection to MtGox.**
Why is this same nonsense repeated everywhere? Is now every large withdraw from an exchange claimed as a sell by MtGox? Guys, please do your research, the MtGox addresses are known. Moreover, it seems absolutely plausible that someone wanting to sell 200k BTC would approach an CNBC reporter for this... I mean who else would you go to? I got approached by a nigerian prince who wanted to send me $millions last week. No more fake news!

Firstly because it is absolutely unrealistic to find a private key, even if all computers on planet earth would collaborate. And secondly the Bitcoins attributed to Satoshi all sit in their mined addresses, so these are many addresses all holding 50BTC each and each has a separate private key

I'd say having the data from all exchanges would give a pretty good estimate of nr of users. But just adding the stated nr together is also wrong because you would need to exclude duplicates - I for instance have accounts on many different exchanges. So the best way to do it would be to get a name list from all major exchanges, but I sincerely hope they don't just hand out that information :D
From the blockchain alone you can make a guess but the information is not conclusive at all. I could sell my friend Julie her first Bitcoin and the only thing you would see on the blockchain is a new address with 1 BTC in it. You wouldn't know whether this was just a new address belonging to me or if it in fact belongs to a new user (Julie).
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:15:45
Block 1 surely was also mined by Satoshi, like most blocks in the beginning. I think the first and also one of the few known coins sent by Satoshi, were those he mined in block 9. Genesis block coins \(block 0\) can't be spent

You can very easily calculate that yourself if you check the prices from your desired time frame and compare them to today's. So people who bought close to the alltime high at about $20000 are now around $11000 per BTC away from breaking even. People who bought close to the bottom of your time frame at $9000 in jan are currently about even. Basically everybody who bought above the bottom of your time frame is still in red.

[1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF]( is impressive in the top 10. Almost 80k BTC hodled since 2011 \(these coins were allegedly stolen from MtGox\)
[198aMn6ZYAczwrE5NvNTUMyJ5qkfy4g3Hi]( is the only 2009 hodler among the top 1000 richest addresses. 8k BTC since 2009 \(most likely lost\)

This data is read from the blockchain. Addresses are not the same as wallets. A user can have hundreds of addresses in his wallet. An exchange might have one address that holds the funds for millions of users. Most exchanges have a system of cold and hot addresses, some do individual addresses for users and some just split the funds in multiple addresses. Regardless of their address strategy, all exchanges allocate funds to their users internally, which is not represented on the blockchain.

So probably Dave Kleiman was simply an early Bitcoin miner. Scammy Craig Wright knew about this and his upcoming death. So he somehow managed to get hold of his coins and also forged contracts and backdated data to gain even more from the poor deceased fellow while trying to also gain social power with his fake Satoshi story. It doesn't sound like either of these two has anything to do with Satoshi Nakamoto.
It goes to show, be very careful who you talk to about your Bitcoin holdings, especially if you have 'friends' like Craig Wright.

I think this address might be the trustee's \(or Kraken's? they work with the trustee\) hot wallet of sorts. The other addresses are presumably cold storage, perhaps with  a key split scheme and other saftey measures implemented.
