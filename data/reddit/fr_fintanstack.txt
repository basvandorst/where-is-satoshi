No problem thanks for trying, even for people as expert as us at Bitcoins (which I'm guessing is 95% of people involved) it's still a very frustrating experience.

Damn that's really good, was getting €1.09 from my bank. Thanks!

Do you know what their current GBP to EUR rate is?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:10:27
That's when it reaches €9999, it won't go above €10000 for the time being.

Use GDAX or  and look at the depth chart

First off no one has a phone with that much memory, you must be mistaken or you are living in the future! Next thing is I wouldn't recommend a phone to store bitcoins due to the added weight. You wouldn't carry around $10000 in pennies in your pocket would you? Bitcoins are worth far more than that now.
I haven't got my public key on me now but I think there was a 6 in it, just keep trying different addresses and I'll let you know when it gets through.

You have to buy an extra big hard drive, a 200mb drive is 200 million bytes so that should (just) be enough, probably best to get a 300mb one though. Hell, you can afford it now.
If anyone else wants expert advice (for a small fee) I can PM you my public key.

A related question is that if I had X bitcoin in GDAX when the fork happened and have since moved that to a private wallet, will I still get X BCH when they release it?

Have you tried going on to GDAX, click deposit then change the source to "Coinbase" and add it from there? I didn't have this problem but am using a VPN so it looks like I'm in Europe.
edit: Also make sure you have "BTC/EUR" selected at the top left of the main GDAX window next to the GDAX logo.

NPCs never can unfortunately.

I presume you are refering to the BNP and the EDL. He left the BNP after one meeting because when he showed up to the second meeting with his mates he was told the black ones couldn't come in, so he told them where to go. The EDL are not a "fascist" organisation by any definition that I can find unless you are take the word by its modern perjorative definition used by the Left to mean anyone not fully on board with their world view. He founded it to counter a specific ideology that he saw was causing massive damage to his home town and country and as with the BNP he left it once he found it to be racist.


Have you heard from his own mouth what his thoughts are on immigration?

Do you know why he left the BNP?
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:32:52


This is completely 100% false.

I've never seen one of you people ever do this even once in Tommy's case.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:43:05
Try me? As I said I've never heard anyone give a reason why he is "far right" or a "fascist". If you actually take the time to listen to the man he comes out as fairly centrist in his beliefs on immigration, race etc.

It's the journalists that are broken.

Didn't say they weren't, they are transparent in their motives though.
