But I suggest you just invest in alternative currencies, unless you can afford a several thousand dollar investment.

Yes it's an investment in a currency that can fluctuate at any time.  High risk high reward, but stupid risk which you can rationalize to mean high risk has potential to ruin you depending on how much of you r income you are dropping.  
Personally,. I prefer investing in Alternative Cryptocurrency and playing the markets like a stock exchange.  It's a great way to profit if you learn how to do it properly. Buy cheap sell high, it's like a business.  You can easily buy and sell the coin for Bitcoin, and you can help hype up certain coins by sharing them on forums or social media.  
Tldr: Altcoins are a great way to dip your feet in a huge pool of Bitcoin investors and make more coin which are valued from Bitcoin.  Use posting in forums and social media to help increase any coin's notoeriety.

Because it only makes cents.

SO when are you able to actually buy bitcoins?  a 100 bux gets me like a little over a third of a bitcoin.  So, Circle, stick to coinbase then, since they allow me to buy bitcoin(s) ?

So you just need something that takes an entered BTC address and sends it to a server to pay (gift IE donate) to your btc address?  That's pretty simple if that's all you need, some simple PHP or JS oughta do it.
