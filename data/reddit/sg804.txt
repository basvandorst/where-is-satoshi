Agreed. I'm only pulling enough out next year to clear my existing student + car loans and minor credit card debt and letting the rest ride. The things you own end up owning you.

It shot up over 1k every time I checked this morning. Absolutely fucking absurd and I love it.

Looks like it bounced around 940. Wonder what will happen when the west coast wakes up.

Nicely written. You cover a lot of ground while keeping it very accessible.

Blockchain claims to be the most popular android wallet, and seems quite secure as far as account protection goes. However, your wallet is still stored on their servers so there is some inherent risk.
With that said its a simple and convenient wallet that I use for storing small amounts before I transfer to cold storage.   
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:18:21
Lets see how it fares as the sun rises on the west coast. The quick recovery should ease the shock.

Basically just install Trezor bridge and go to trezor.io to set up and access your wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:29:01
Strange, I had to create a PIN while setting up my trezor.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:25:13
I added to it. We should do a circle around it and fill in with more orange when the border is done.

You can change the display image from the default trezor lock logo to a number of preset options or any image you want.

Phew, just got mine and set it up this week. AFAIK only the gray one was in stock when I ordered, Black and white were backordered till like March.
With that said, I recommend it highly. Very secure and super easy to set up and use.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:23:39
Quite possibly today.
Edit: 4k!!!
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:42:38
I hope to hodl until it's accepted damn near everywhere. Then I can spend it without giving Uncle Sam a cut.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:14:29
I had considered that I misspelled a word but I had no idea there was a reference list. Thanks! I'll give a that a shot.
Edit: Turns out the seed was correct but it wasn't a mycelium wallet I had transferred it to, it was an old blockchain wallet that I thought I had locked myself out of. Luckily it turns out I had that seed. Thanks again! If not for your advice, I probably wouldn't have attempted recovery again. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:29:45
Fuuuuck. I managed to lose like .2 btc in a mycelium wallet when i forgot the pin. Can't even imagine that kind of loss.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:39:15
I'm honestly not sure as I've never used paper wallets. Surely someone more knowledgeable can answer this.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:06:40
I just recently did that. Might buy back a little bcash if/when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:22:16
With a qr address on it? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:36:32
Trezor has a [coin splitting tool]( that allows you to separate your BCH from pre-fork BTC. You don't have to move it to a third-party wallet or anything, it creates a bcash wallet on your trezor. 
AFAIK only the beta wallet currently supports BCH. It's still perfectly secure, some components just have stability issues.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:11:09
Thanks for the link, but I just sorted it out. I had mixed up up which old wallet I sent it to and managed to recover the right one. Now everything's safely on my hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:36:16
The more things you own, the more they own you. I'm just going to live modestly yet comfortably and probably travel a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:39:53
In case you didn't see my edit, I managed to recover it! It wasn't a misspelled seed, however. I mixed up which address I had sent it to and managed to recover that wallet. And even better, it was .25, not .2! 
I used a little of it to pay for your gold :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:21:36
Seriously. They're almost always a cesspool of ignorance and hatred.

Dumped via shapeshift for more btc last night. Yay, free magic internet money!
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:30:19
There is a [helpful thread in the trezor subreddit]( 
I had to update the firmware on my trezor to access the beta wallet (which supports BCH). Then I simply used the trezor BCH claim tool linked in that thread to split my BCH from my BTC and sent it to the address shapeshift.io provided. Shapeshift then exchanged it for BTC, which was deposited back in my trezor wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:02:20
Seriously. Just today I heard it come up on the audio version of the Rachel Maddow show (in the context of Putin's interest in crypto) right after seeing the CNBC report posted here. The tide is turning. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:29:37
Good to know, but I thought I had to root my phone to recover it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:18:30
I wonder how much of this is bcash dumping vs new investment.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:31:10
If you have a trezor, you can monitor the balance of your wallet through mycelium.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:15:56
Thanks! Can't believe I've spent seven years dicking around on Reddit, but at least it helped get me into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:14:39
I was sure I had the recovery seed written down but none of phrases I tried worked. I still have the phone and whatever old seeds I had so I'll probably try to recover it again, but I didn't have any luck the first time :(
Learned my lesson, got a Trezor and secured a couple of copies of the recovery seeds. Luckily that .2 wasn't all of my holdings, just a portion I was considering selling.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:37:38
At this rate I'll be surprised if it doesn't break 10k by 2018.

Heard about it in 2011-12 but thought it was just for silkroad and whatnot. In 2016 a co-worker convinced me to pick some up and I moved a large portion of my savings in sub 1k/BTC. Hodling ever since.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:19:30
No problem. Agreed, it's a limited feature but at least it's a useful addition for their customers. It's promising to see my bank take steps like that instead of locking accounts for crypto purchases like some other banks do.

Honestly I think the odds aren't bad. We're still early adopters- when the momentum hits a tipping point there's no telling where it's gonna go. I just hope the infrastructure is in place to accommodate it by then.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:56:28
Up $400 in 24hr. I mean what in the fuck. I knew we were still early adopters but seeing the next wave of investment start trickling in is unreal.
