Taking out a loan that compounds in interest to invest into any speculative asset without any risk controls is a sure way to go bankrupt. Sure, I’m quite bullish on BTC as well, but you will be making a grave error doing this. Only invest how much you’re willing to lose.

I started trading and investing when I was 14. I never made a profit and all of my trading resulted in losses. I’m 25 now and am finally getting the hang of trading and investing. Be patient, read trading psychology, and don’t ever FOMO into any investment unless you’ve done your research and know what you’re getting into. Investing is great but learning how to trade will make you a better investor. Learn about risk management, setting stop losses, and other technical analysis principles to help you make better fundamental choices. Most importantly, you’ve only lost once you’ve given up. You’ll be fine. Good luck!

Buy, hold, and forget about it for 2-3 years. Price fluctuation will have you checking your account consistently so it’s better that you just pretend that you’ve already lost this money if you decide to invest into Bitcoin. Good luck!

For fiat to crypto, Coinbase or Gemini are pretty reputable services. Not sure where you are but if you’re in the States, I highly recommend Coinbase.

Bitcoin isn’t widely understood by most people yet. When people think Bitcoin, they automatically think money laundering, scam, price volatility, and other shady uses. Because the technology is still so new, the infrastructure also hasn’t been set up for mass adoption. Just think about it for a second. In the states, when you’re hanging with your friends and need to split the bill, what do you use? Often times it’s a service like Venmo or some sort of cash split app. There hasn’t really been a widely accepted crypto wallet or app that is used yet. In order for that to really happen some key issues such as price volatility, transaction fees, network speeds need to be solved. Nobody wants to have to pay for a transaction fee when sending a few dollars. Additionally, the final component that needs to be made clear is whether the government supports crypto. Most people still trust in their governments for the most part so if the government goes on the record and officially declares crypto safe and easy to use, the public will likely start to consider it. Until these issues are addressed and resolved, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely be used primarily as a form of speculation for investment purposes.

Just use Coinbase and Binance. It’s really not that complicated.

Here comes the beginning of mass adoption.

The fact that NY Post is saying it’ll go to zero is the reason why Bitcoin is just getting started

This old man must’ve lost his mind. Stuck in the 20th century
