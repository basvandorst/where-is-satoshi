Not really defending OP but Venezuelan IDs are very bad, they print them in a paper like this
the paper has small holes to split them, his seems like it was not aligned correctly

Its probably fake, but your points are bulshit.
1. Your English is too good (you claim to be a non native speaker).
People can learn other languages, a civil engineer should speak english because most of the material in his career is in english.


Anonymity? he says his family is still in Venezuela


I'm in Venezuela and I have an internet connection, is shit but you can have one.


Some products shipped with DHL, we can also use mail companies that receive the package in USA and bring it to Venezuela, search "venezuela courier", what OP mentioned was a gift card, people use them to save money, you save a 100$ giftcard instead of 700000 bolivares that in 3 months can only buy a 25$ gift card and so on until those initial 100$ can only buy a cup of cofee.


The ID seems normal, it doesn't look photoshoped, Venezuelan IDs are horrible, have printing errors, are cut badly and the plastic cover is very bad, the cubans have charged millions of dollars multiple times for new ones and all we have is a piece of paper you can fake with a home printer, a passport is better proof but if OP went to ecuador ilegally he probably doesn't have one


In the real world these things happen everyday.
