Hi, can you PM me his ticket number/ email? I'll ask our team to take a look. We require customers to be verified before they can trade, so your friend likely hit his limit :)

Pretty cool. Anyone try funding with a credit card yet?

I think you're confusing them with another company, BitX.co didn't have any ATMs, much less get hacked

RemindMe! 16 days "950btc guy"
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:44:09
Yeah, they do about 150 a day. Check bitx.co

Hi, I think you have them confused with my twitter profile. 
If you have any specific issues or suggestions, you're welcome to send me a PM.

This guy gets it.

I think faucets are a big reason why hosted wallets now charge fees
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:57:06
Unidirectional can have advantages, especially between exchanges and hosted wallets. People buy one place and then send it to their wallet. If there's enough demand, just open up a new channel. 
I agree that something baked in like lightning has advantages, but I'd prefer to have quick cheap payments for most of my transactions.

FUD? More like conspiracy theory
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:26:57
I'm not sure, but I would imagine it's useful for some channels that have more payments one way than the other, so for example Coinbase to a merchant service like steam. That's rarely both ways.

I wonder what those "other" coins are...

Hi, I work at Luno, but replying from my personal account since we don't have an official one. 
We're a legit Bitcion exchange (although, I guess that's what a scammer would say right?) operating in a couple of different [countries]( and are funded by some well known [companies]( including DCG.
It appears that someone has tried signed up for an account using your email address. We suspect that someone has obtained a list of emails &amp; passwords and is trying to determine if any of those email addresses have accounts with us. 
The consequence of that is that people like yourself who do not have an account with us were unwillingly sent emails to confirm signing up. We won't create an account for you and also we will not keep your email address if you don't click on the "Confirm Email Address" link. 
We suggest that you change your email password as it may be compromised, and ensure that you have two-factor authentication enabled on your accounts. 
Again, really sorry for the trouble. We're investigating this on our end, and doing everything we can to prevent it happening again. 
If you do get similar emails from other places, please let us know.

Someone might be trying the same thing there. You're welcome to send it to support and we can take a look at it.
