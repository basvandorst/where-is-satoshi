Guys, are my Botcoins worthless? 
I just checked my BotCoin Purse and it only says 57 SchruteBucks

...aaaand that's how we get aristocracy/segregation.
We got rid of poll taxes and literacy tests for a reason, buddy.

If I recall, it was stealing/selling identities online from phone-based records databases and also committing blatant stock market fraud

I technically never mentioned anything about race, although the popular connotation of "segregation" is racial division and disenfranchisement, it could also apply to a caste system of another sort. Codifying the wealth status of today's rich into greater representative privilege would mean a certain type of caste system. 
However, statistically speaking, burdens on the poor tend to translate into burdens more on some races than others, so that's another good point.

Ah, yes. Because incomes don't change during a surprise recession/depression

$1000 is a lot to me and I'm 24. That could pay off like 1/30 of my debt...

Recessions are pretty common. When's the last time we went two decades without one?

You won't be saying that during the next US recession when everyone's screaming like chickens with their peckers cut off 
I'm expecting it to be soon, perhaps before Trump's second term is over.

I exclusive have sex with chicks that don't exist. Because I'm married. 
It's like free prostitutes, except I'm paying money and no one's having sex.
