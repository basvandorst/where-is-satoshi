I've been using takara for a few days linked to my indiesquare wallet to drop Counterparty tokens. When I first started, I filled one takara with $19 USD and dropped it in a remote area of Germany. I then swept the money back to my indiesquare wallet via the private key in the app history. I assumed the takara I dropped would disappear. However, it remains, showing a $19 amount. 
Assuming this is still a Beta app, I think the developers will probably clean up most of the minor issues before or shortly after an Android release. Aside from that "problem", it has worked for me without issue. I've been dropping Counterparty tokens around the globe.
The potential uses for the app and others like it are huge. I'm thinking along the lines of ComicCon and Xmas sales. Tokens can be anything you make them, a coupon, a currency, a ticket, a verification, etc. the Counterparty team is readying an Ethereum virtual machine which will add Ethereum smart contract abilities to Bitcoin, minus the retread forks. 
Takara appears to be the Pong of the coming wave. I'm betting Counterparty is Atari. I may be wrong, but I'm hopeful and excited.

Use an EPESO asset within Counterparty pegged to the Peso for large transactions. Then use an EPESO asset within Dogeparty for small, fast transactions, such as between mobile wallets. The transaction costs for the smaller transfers within Dogeparty would be very economical, which would promote it's use. The beauty is, that both assets could bear the name EPESO and be pegged to the fiat Peso via a 1 for 1 exchange of fiat by the banks and other approved stakeholders. I know that doesn't fit the Libertarian ideal, but if they're going to do it anyway, they might as well do it openly within a public blockchain.

Just create the currency in Counterparty. Control the issuance and peg the price. The banks can utilize the existing blockchain.

Googled the relevant terms and connected the dots. Albeit, I made quite a few assumptions that may or may not be correct.

USAID put out a contract to perform this function in early 2014. Their E-PESO proposal fleshes out ideas from sources compiled in 2001-2012. Citi-bank is in on the deal with some kind of plan for several other countries that reads like a re-invention of the wheel. The congressional proposal may just be political posturing for back-room negotiations.
They may want to look at a Counterparty solution. The EPESO could run on the Bitcoin block chain. Heck, Citi-bank could save a bundle going that route and put the savings in their pocket. Their e-payment/m-money system could run on a smartphone if it were not reinvented. Just use the existing block chain via Counterparty.

They might be saying that they want to lock the asset name across all platforms. That is, if I'm reading it correctly?
I run WXYZ company.
I want WXYZ coin.
I want to lock WXYZ token, coin, asset across all of the current platforms, so that someone can't squat on my name and cause confusion. It would also hedge against problems if the differing platforms are later combined in some way.

I don't know who you are, but she is a self-demonstrated idiot. If you are in the crypto-space, please step back behind the safety line with me. Let us allow the scientists space to do their job.

I just can't stop thinking about how much this appears to match...

With that level of access and her low technical understanding, she can only do harm. For example, I am well trained in small unit Infantry tactics and have years of experience functioning within, leading and critiquing that specific military area. However, I do not promote myself as some kind of authority on the future battlefield implementation of small unit offensive tactics. I do not set up a conference with the Joint Chiefs to try and influence their decision making, just because I have years humping a ruck and rifle.
She is a danger if not pegged for what she brings to the table, misinformation and over-simplification to a perilous extent, that may adversely influence others. Her apparent hubris and functional illiteracy, even standing alone would lead others to eventual dismiss Ms. Boring as a carpetbagger, but she is attempting to drag us all along for the ride for the last days of the crypto Wild-West. Unchecked and unopposed, she will have grave financial implications for all crypto.
This was not the first time:
I encourage everyone to check the "Chamber" website  and notify the "members" who have lent their credibility to her endeavor. For example, I have a vested interest in USAA and will absolutely send this interview up the flagpole. Hopefully they have no idea they are members of the Chamber.

10X is just math. She is one, we are many.

XCoins is doing a particularly poor job of confirming their ID's. I had a chargeback, where the person in the ID was male, and the person holding the ID was female. The ID itself was a hand cut U.S. passport card that looked like a bad photoshop job printed out on plain paper via an inkjet. I fully expect more chargebacks of this sort. I'll wait a month to see if any more fall-out occurs. Until then, no more lending for me as we are the only ones at risk and wholly dependent upon Xcoins to perform above an amateur level. It's a great idea executed like a kids lemonade stand.

Have you considered tokenized assets for your business? You could make a Counterparty token and use it as a discount, or loyalty point. It rides on the Bitcoin Blockchain and it may be a good way to get your customers into using Bitcoin. Indiesquare wallet is a good way to get started, as it is a Bitcoin wallet and is able to see Counterparty tokens. 
Secondly, if you download the Takara app, you can drop and pick-up tokens and Bitcoin via Geocache's. I dropped a bunch of assets all over the Philippines. That app would be a great way to get kids and adults involved. The schools could use it as a reward system for little geolocated riddles, etc. Its a really cool metalayer on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain.

Oh Jesus, is Garza and GAW back at it? btc"GAW".com or is it just a coincidence and the following article has it right?
