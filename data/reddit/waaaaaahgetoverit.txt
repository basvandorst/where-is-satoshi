Because knowing facts and using common sense we can safely say that Bitcoin Is Bitcoin, And Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.
  


 
If Bitcoin Cash was to be called Bitcoin, this would be in direct contradiction of the facts.
The only reason for Bitcoin Cash to require the name is if they know they cannot survive with the public having knowledge that it is just a Hard Fork Of Bitcoin.
  
Nothing but a cut and paste copy.
  
Paste in Roger Ver, Jian and other, you’ve got yourself a great Hard Fork.
  
Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash will continue to be Bitcoin Cash.
That’s the way the history of this will play out.

If it’s real, the people buying the accounts risk the owners being able to wait for funds to be deposited and then simply contacting the exchange, providing the ID used when verification was done, and having the password and email reset.

He’s been told by Roger that if he wants to keep riding his dick he has to start censoring and banning people who are pointing out truths and facts.
They banned me for calling BCH bcash, like the media do, like exchanges do, like wallets do.
That mod comes in and blatantly lies saying “bcash hasn’t launched yet, you don’t know what your talking about, BCH isn’t bcash”
That’s the most pathetic I’ve ever seen someone be

If you’ve got an interest free period, get points, and have the $100k in cash to pay off the cards, it’s actually smarter to buy on credit card for the loyalty points and then pay it off IF you have an interest free period and your crypto purchase is treated as a purchase

I have a Ledger Nano S, can confirm this is rubbish.

You also don’t have your seed words anymore if you deleted them without emailing them first.
If you don’t have a copy of the seed, send your funds to a new wallet and reset the ledger and then send them back.
If you don’t have the seed, you don’t own your coins

Only if you’re unable to pay,
Then idea behind churning is you have the money, but buying that $1000 item via your CC instead of with the money, could net you $1000 worth points.
If the rest of the terms line up alright, low - no fees, interest free period (even 30 days is enough) it can actually be a great way to earn like above airline miles for flights, you can redeem points for gift cards or other things.

@_date: 2018-01-05 03:12:07
Did you verify the address on the keepkey before sending the tx? 
If you copy and pasted the address from shapeshift and it’s changed, chances are one of two things happened.
1) you’ve pasted a key you’d copied before the shapeshift one.
2) something’s replaced the key you copied from shapeshift and replaced it when you entered it into your wallet.

VISA have actually issued a notice to almost all prepaid VISA program members, if your card issuer hasn’t informed you yet you’ll need to contact them.
Everyone needs to understand the reason it’s a prepaid VISA is VISA refused proper debit and credit facilities to begin with, they never wanted “Crypto Cards” and it’s becoming more evident everyday 


Visa has other approved card programmes that use fiat funds converted from cryptocurrency in a number of jurisdictions. The termination of WaveCrest’s Visa membership does not affect these other products.”

@_date: 2018-01-05 03:37:47
Yeah I’m trying to figure out why and what happended, tx shows it should be sitting in the change address but the keepkey isn’t picking it up for some reason

Because people shouldn’t be aloud to decree what they deem is “The Real Bitcoin” in this ideological war.
At approximately 4 pm EDT at block height 504031, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network had successfully hard forked. The fork is a change to the decentralized.
That is code, a hard fork of BITCOIN took place at block hight 504031, that hard fork is named BITCOIN CASH
If you believe, have been told, or read anything that says otherwise, that is a lie.
And I mentioned Roger because any opportunity to point out the continued attempts to remove the name of Bitcoin Cash, which is a hard fork of Bitcoin, and replace it with the name Bitcoin by Roger, Jian and all other party’s involved (DYOR)

Nope, welcome to what’s called, “seeing is believing”
Those people bitching about fees, they count on you not having any BTC like them so you can’t see for yourself how low and quick the tx can be.
Never believe anything you read until you’ve experienced yourself.

Now you do.

If your funds are just missing it begs to say that your account was compromised and that your funds were stolen.

@_date: 2017-12-29 15:17:07
Naah it’s a good question.
My theory is they rely on the higher fee from the direct coinbase and recoup the lost fees from GDAX via trade fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:24:07
It’s a painful lesson, but this happens.
It need to happen once, now, you’ll never forget to check and set your own fees again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:39:33
Yeah i transferred today and took less then 2 hours with less then $10 in fees.
The only people complaining about fees are “redditor for x days” and people who don’t understand when you use wallets that let YOU set your fees, it can and usually is cheaper and just as fast.

Non segwit wallet to segwit wallet, not a segwit tx
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:03:19
Alright so for any newcomers.
COINBASE &gt; GDAX &gt; WALLET = 0 FEES.
They eat the fee for external transactions going out of GDAX.
If your on Coinbase and want to get off and into a segwit wallet. Do it via GDAX.
I’ve seen this posted dozens of times in new, or asking why the tx fees from coinbase are so high.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:01:03
Yeah that’s the case then.
For example.
BTC withdrawal from non segwit @ bittrex - 0.001 BTC = $15
BTC withdrawal from segwit wallet @ coinexchange.io - 0.0005 BTC = $7 
Anyone who tells you segwit won’t reduce fees is lying, straight up.
I would advise having a look at the wallets in that post first and then just checking the staring digit of generated addresses is the easier way, some openly state they use segwit some don’t.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:56:46
Wow only 2 years till 2020... that’s not too long, fees were always to replace the miner fee so it didn’t happen too early.

MOVE TO A  WALET THAT LETS YOU SET FEES
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:58:20
This is a arsehole answer, but it’s because to coinbase that fee is nothing.
And to most users who are transfers thousands, the $20-50 fee isn’t something that’s an issue.
To a majority of Bitcoin users, the fees are minuscule when compared to other money transfer platforms.
Western Union $20,000 and see how much it costs 
Paypal fee for goods and services is % based.

Your mistake was using coinbase. 
A simple check of this subreddit your posting in would of given you a guide to getting around coinbase’s fees and getting your BTC to a better wallet that lets YOU set the tx fee.
If you withdraw using coinbase, it’s your own fault not BTC

False, if you’d like me to send you some BTC because you don’t have any, PM me so you can conduct a test withdrawal and see what “fee” you are charged.
If you have some, please test and report back, you’ll find your response to be something along the lines of;
“There was no fee for my withdrawal” 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:44:43
If the transactions never confirm then the coins should be returned to the sending address after 14 days.
Some wallets will continue to attempt to broadcast, resulting in the transaction never dropping off and requiring the user correct it themselves.

That fee, think of that as a idiot tax at this point.
If you send via coinbase, idiot tax
If you send via recommended fee, idiot tax
If you sell your BTC for something not worthwhile, idiot tax.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:08:46
Yeah I’m in the same boat as you, but most was $4-$6 before the runup.
Most people right now I feel will be taking a loss as people like us, who have more controlled exits allocated to minimize loss of profit wouldn’t be moving it as that BTC @ 11k is already in the place it needs to be to move it when it reaches its exit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:35:55
If your moving it now, it’s too late.
You’ll sell for a loss and buy back from someone like me at a higher price for even more of a loss.

I use a ledger nano s, it’s suggested fee has always been lower and quicker then other wallets.
I couldn’t truly suggest a good desktop wallet as I don’t use them enough to recommend one, do some research and check out Electrum, I keep seeing people recommend that one more then others.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:15:43
Simple answer.
Since you joined 6 weeks ago, what was the price? 
I myself bought 4K bitcoin, and 6k and 8k bitcoin in the last 6 months, along with more below that.
The price increase always comes with a retreat, has since 2009, will till 2xxx

Cashing out to fiat is the wrong way to do it but understandable.
I’d prefer transactions peer to peer with bitcoin, I’ve seen some classified ads and Facebook marketplace sellers accepting bitcoin for goods, as long as their are more services for people to exchange bitcoin for goods and services without the servicer or customer needing to change into fiat is when the real rise of cryptocurrency begins

So this is exactly why I never used nicehash, it doesn’t take a genius to see its a scam. 
Take a look at the cost to hire the hashing power vs the price they “pay” you for mining that for someone.
The margins are so small that you’d have to think somethings up, that they wouldn’t really operate with such small margins.
Not to mention the “wallet and withdrawal fee” clearly being used to push users to their webwallet AND leave BTC held up until the 0.01 is reached.
Mine to a pool, take whatever you had the nicehash software miner mining and do it yourself.
Hell you can compile you own miner and remove the fee they take, increasing profits while actually getting your money a lot earlier 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:12:14
Can be bothered checking , surprise.
Guess what, I can’t be bothered indulging you.
I’ve linked a map with over 11k places that accepts BTC, it’s no way complete.
Just look for the “BTC accepted here” sign, it’s the one that’s never next to the “BTC Forks Accepted here”

Actually it’s maah and paaaah that’s being shat on right now.
This is how the financial independence happens kids, by ripping it out of the hands of the generations that destroyed the systems that have bought us to this point.
It’s financial selection of the fittest using logic, reason, and high level intellect to understand the underlying technology and weed out those who don’t.
At the end of it all, we will have a much better world for it.

Bitcointalk, the forums created by the creator of bitcoin....
The Bitcoin Forum is a website meant to host free discussion of Bitcoin and related topics. It is operated mainly as a service to the community, and the vast majority of income after expenses is either saved for future expenses or reinvested into the forum or the community. The forum was started in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin.

I use a ledger Nano S, wouldn’t be able to recommend a good web wallet as I don’t use them that often, others could chime in with their preferred wallets that are segwit and let you set tx fees, there’s also a post showing which wallets and exchanges support segwit

Coinbase is ripping you off.
They choose to use a more expensive wallet to send the tx from, forcing a higher tx fee, while not allowing you to set a lower fee.

Why should company’s support a wallet feature that would lower fees drastically?
BTC withdrawal via Bittrex - Non Segwit Wallet - 0.001 - $19.13
BTC via coinexchange.io - Segwit Wallet - 0.0005 - $9.56
that’s a $10 saving for the consumer

If you want to be semantic about it sure.
To the average person, it means that’s there’s no fee.

Just because you’ve gotten off coinbase, doesn’t mean that when someone “recommends” a fee via their wallet it’s not wildly overpriced.
If you walk into a car dealership, they won’t recommend the cheapest car for your needs.
BTC wallets are exactly the same.

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:27:17
Sorry but if you violate the terms of service or neglect to read them before signing up to the service it’s your own fault.
I’d been warning people that if you agree to these exchanges terms of service, you not only forfeit your right to pursue legal action, but they are entirely within their right to disable your account and retain all your funds.
Unless you control your keys, you don’t truly own your funds.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:53:15
We should, that if you withdraw via coinbase, there are fees.
If you withdraw via GDAX there is no fee.
It clearly would state the fee, like coinbase, if they in future decide to cancel said deal.

I think the only thing roger ver deserves is to fade into oblivion alongside his beloved bcash.

Yeah don’t be using coinbase.
Coinbase charge fees.
GDAX is owned by coinbase.
Coinbase &gt; GDAX transfers fee free.
GDAX &gt; YOUR EXTERNAL WALLET fee free.
DONT WITHDRAW VIA COINBASE.
It’s just throwing away your money at this point.

Yeah peer to peer charity is IMO better then any directed charity usually.
Take someone and ask them what they need.
Ask a student.
Student loans paid so they aren’t a burden in life.
Ask a homeless person.
Clothes, warm coats and food.
Ask a single mother.
Whatever her children need.
Just those three things could change those three peoples lives forever. 
I love the UBI concept, but the fundamental problem in these third world countries isn’t their lack of financials but the lack of affordable amenities and services.
You can give them all the money in the world but if they can’t spend it, and the local prices are exorbitant, aren’t we just helping continue the cycle of poverty?  
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:42:56

are you the kind of person to scream at a person giving away “free” items because there’s an inherent cost to them.
That’s basically what your doing.
Coinbase &gt; External Wallet = Fee for Tx
Coinbase &gt; GDAX &gt; External Wallet = No fee Tx
It’s correct, truthful, fact based and I don’t understand what the problem seems to be.
I don’t need to explain to new people the mechanic behind how or why there isn’t a fee, they have trouble understanding the underlying technology they are investing into, no need to confuse them more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:40:29
You want to get away from any non segwit wallet that you can’t choose your fees on.
Coinbase will fuck you to get the BTC out, I think via GDAX it gets cheaper 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:31:45
Regardless of how or why, the statement that there’s no fees withdrawing from GDAX is true and correct

It’s simple, they don’t have to.

Yeah I see all this “if they do that I’ll sue”
All that’ll do is tie you up in more legal costs and time while they make off with your money while taking more in the form of legal fees when they decide in the exchanges favour.
Seriously, read the websites your using’s terms of service and quickly realise that they are way more protected then you will ever be
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:05:26
Gtfo with your legally required when you haven’t even read the terms of service for the exchanges you use.
Did you know that they can close your account, keep the funds, and because you clicked accept on the terms of service giving them that right you’ll have zero legal recourse.
Just like now, you’ve got nothing to use against them, zero chance at litigation, move your funds off exchanges is the only thing you can do right now
