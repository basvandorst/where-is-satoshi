Well you was expecting somebody writing a shit article about Liverpool, in  Liverpool fans forum, to be well received and praised. Very logical way of thinking. Keep going.

This is the big news?
Jesus. What an idiot!
He damaged the price of BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:00:47
The guy is simply stupid.
He created an unnecessary pressure in BTC price with his silly tweet yesterday.

People in Cyprus admit thet Neo's campaign has been one of the most successful ever launched in Cyprus.
Awesome work by Telia &amp; Pavla BBDO.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:08:46
Their PR is very good. They have sponsored  lot of soccer games which is by far the most popular sports in cyprus.
@_date: 2014-01-20 12:08:26
He is not praising it. The guy is just doing a prediction...
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:32:26
Does it work? I trust it is ok now.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:53:52
Yes, true. Without the Mt.Cox shit, this event would have had worldwide media coverage.
Instead, everybody is talking about the fatman's shithole that has created millions of losses to bitcoiners.

Tax experts here in Cyprus say that:
1. We will adopt the recent UK tax rules on Bitcoin
2. Profits from the sale of Bitcoins will be tax exempt (as in the case of shares and other securities).
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:46:53
The private sector will lead this, forget the idiot politicians.
Even the Minister of Finance knows this and he publicly admitted it to CNBC when asked about Bitcoin!
See this 
Cyprus sees more stability, even bitcoin innovation

Question addressed to everybody then:)

What a shame.
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:48:50
Awesome. Just registered for the MOOC.
Very interesting:
1. The University will be offering up to €5M of scholarships to students from 139 “low and middle income countries” (as classified by the World Bank).
2. Students paying in Bitcoin will receive a 5% discount on the “net fees” (i.e. after scholarship) payable

Here is the link to the UK tax rules on Bitcoin

Tuur and Andreas are not to be blamed.
I think the mention is for factual reasons.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:00:48
So if I get it right:
If someone wants credit/certificate, he needs to particiapate in sessions and complete exercices and assessment.
If not, he simply participates free of charge.

The Wall Street Journal has "baptized" the University of Nicosia, as "the University of Bitcoin"!

The University of Bitcoin Rises in Cyprus 
University of Nicosia
By Paul Vigna
It’s been a hyperkinetic week for bitcoin. The virtual currency’s value shot through the digital roof amid a Senate hearing on crypto currencies that was generally supportive. On some exchanges, bitcoin’s value briefly touched $900. If that isn’t high enough, Richard Branson is talking about taking bitcoin as payment for trips to space.
But one rather mundane news story might be the most significant of all: The University of Nicosia in Cyprus announced it will accept bitcoin as payment, for everything from tuition to rent to books at the bookstore and meals in the cafeteria. The school also announced a master’s level course of study in digital currency, one that is aimed not at bitcoiners themselves, but at business professionals, government officials and anybody seeking to learn about the field.
“We might be seeing the advent of the Internet of money right before our eyes,” Dr. Christos Vlachos, the university’s chief financial officer, told MoneyBeat in a phone interview from Nicosia. “We are possibly at the commencement of a new era.”
What’s most interesting about this announcement, to anybody concerned with the long-term prospects for bitcoin, is that the move didn’t come as a result of Cyprus’s banking crisis this year. Rather, it was simply in response to students, many of them overseas, asking for it. This speaks not to bitcoin’s potential as a end-run around the much derided “fiat currencies,” or as a source of a Pets.com-like boom and bust, but simply to its utility as a way for people to conduct their day-to-day routines.
“It has nothing to do with the banking crisis,” Dr. Vlachos said. “We have a university that has students all over the world, Africa, Asia, Europe. We’ve been getting requests for the last couple of months to take bitcoins.” He noted a large number of the requests came countries like Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, where some students have less access to, and higher costs from, traditional banking systems.
The university, the largest private school in Cyprus,  has about 8,500 students, strung across its Nicosia campus, affiliated schools like the medical program it runs with St. George’s University of London, and an online program. The university dug into bitcoin, and studied it – “we did undertake a very serious study,” he said – and came to the conclusion it would be something that could help its students, that it would be quicker and more convenient. “We said, why not?”
The school expects initially that several hundred students may take advantage of bitcoin, Dr. Vlachos said, but in the years to come he thinks it will become a mainstream form of payment. The university itself is working with a Cypriot company that will handle the transactions on its behalf, converting any payments in bitcoin into euros at prevailing rates. The school isn’t looking to profit off this, he stressed.
“We believe the program we’re launching will be of great interest, not just to consumers, but to bankers, regulators, government officials, reporters,” he said. “This will affect the society at large. This will affect the society as a whole.”

Accurate description of:
1. The state of affairs in Cyprus (except for that some reports state the cash in matresses is around 7 billion) and
2. What happened at the opening event of Neo &amp; Bee. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:00:44
What was the role of Andreas Antonopoulos and Tuur Demeeser in all this?
I have my personal opinion but I want to listen to the "insiders'" view.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:51:53
The haircut was imposed by the troika after our bankers and politicians collapsed the banking system.
Bitcoin will liberate the people of Cyprus.
@_date: 2014-01-18 11:50:48


YES we will also continue doing this as well.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:57:48
I feel sorry for you guys and we thank you for bringing clarity to what happened.
Is it true that you did not open Neo Bee to the public and that no bitcoins were sold to Cypriots other than those sold by Danny personally?
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:38:08
Yeap, I read Tuur's statement. As I expected the guy did not have any direct involvement.
Brewster tried to deafraud investors by "misusing their name and extent of involvement".
As he did with Antonopoulos, as he did with PricewaterhouseCoopers etc etc.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:01:00
Bravo, this is what merchants shou do. Offer incentives for people to use bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:50:56
Capital Gains Tax on securities and financial instruments is 0% in Cyprus.
Of course, the tax authorities have not issued any guidance on Bitcoin yet.

World's first Bitcoin physical portal/location/branch hs been opened today 24 February 2014 at 10.30pm Cyprus time!
The event was a big success. All TV channels were there as well as the main newspapers of the country. 
History has been made today, for the Bitcoin community and the financial world in general.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:35:07
Havelock is a shitty exchange, Neo should get out of this shit.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:33:37
Jesus Christ!
That's fraudulent misrepresentation, putting in the prospectus the name of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the auditors when in fact they were not. 
 
@_date: 2014-01-20 11:48:23
What's the problem?
Any article, anywhere, tries to promote or say something.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:46:44
Some countries will become the centers, as with all financial instruments and currencies.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:45:29
Agree 1,000%
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:26:18
All that the state has to do is to create a regulatory framework for Bitcoin businesses in Cyprus: this will eliminate/reduce the risks associated with digital currencies such as counterparty risk.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT WILL HELP AVOID FUTURE MT.COXES.
@_date: 2014-04-22 08:20:21
Thanks for the summary.
Danny let down a lot of people.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:55:10
Also do not forget Neo's partnership with the biggest University in Cyprus, the University of Nicosia, that was announced some months ago.

He has been in the bank for 40 years. Earned tens of millions in salarise, fat bonuses, golden handshakes, options and, upon leaving, pocketed millions in farewell bonus, leaving behind him a bankrupt, corrupted and robbed bank.
Now he has the audacity to talk about bitcoin, the corrupted skull.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:49:10
I am thinking seriously of signing on the course too.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:20:30

You are absolutely right.

I just passed by the building (I live in the area).
The flagship branch is almost complete, the company's logo has been placed horizontally across the entire face of the 7 Stars Tower (the most prestigious/luxurious building of the area and one of the best in Nicosia) and outside the branch. 
Guys it is AMAZING!

It is the ideal place for Bitcoin to flourish because it is the only European country where bankers have STOLEN people's deposits.
