Hi all i'm Lahav the director and creator of this film. Funny it suddenly showed up here thanks! We intended to crowdfund the production an then release the film on the net for free.
Our current status is reinventing the whole concept of the film to fit an international audience. As mentioned, our local crowd funding didn't make it and there is no way I can even set out on shoots and production without funding since I am young and poor...
If some bitcoin millionaire wishes to fund this project his logo and name will be all over it so just saying... this trailer was only produced for crowd funding but there was not much support locally. I can say the new reinvented film will be in English and international. Hope this reaches the right person/s
Btc address for anonymous support is in the youtube description.

I had the same issue, found that using crontab -e works well but only if bitcoind launch is delayed a bit, add this:  sleep 120; bitcoind

Xapo actually uses your bitcoin balance and instantly only converts the amount of btc needed at time of every card sweep.

Does not compute. Gresham's law states the state has to dictate by law that the bad and good money have similar face value for it to occur

In some places, selling is a taxable event. You immideatly lose 25%. Not worth selling for a rebuy. Makes more sense to Just hodl and use day to day.

I would think large scale mining ops would have maintenance shift rotation for keeping maximum profitability.

Looks like nachokong has picked a side. The propoganda against Israel has succeeded. Sad and doesn't further a solution.
