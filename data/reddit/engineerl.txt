What does this have to do with my argument? He could be a "slavery is freedom" guy and it still wouldn't matter. I'm not forced to do anything he says or doesn't say. Neither are anyone else. The only thing Vitalik can do is to speak his mind and try his best to appeal to our moral sense and reason. 
My notion of a centralized currency is that I'm technically dependent on some central third party to not deceive me, or that I'm at the mercy of some violent aggressor that forces me to comply. Your notion seems to be... different. Do you think that *you* make the choices in your life, or do you think that TV and advertising (and Vitalik Buterin) make them for you? If our choices were never really ours to begin with, then I don't see why we don't just let central bank governors make them for us. We would need their strong, firm hands to guide our weak, manipulable minds.

How do I know what exactly?
There was no "vote". There was never any majority decision on a collective outcome. 100.000 % of nodes and miners in the ETH ecosystem "voted" for the rollback. 100 % of the nodes and miners in the ETC ecosystem "voted" for no rollback.

How many transactions are processed on the Ethereum blockchain per day? How many on the Bitcoin blockchain? And how much value in terms of USD do these transactions represent? The answer may surprise you.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:21:03
Yes, this makes sense. Never let any party spend all their "locked coins".
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:33:08
Not sure what you're getting at here. If more than ~6 blocks are mined per hour, then the next difficulty adjustment fixes this (okay to disagree this is a "fix"), calibrating it down to 6 blocks again by making the hashes harder. This creates lower supply of transaction space on the blockchain and thereby increases fees. Fees are not going to drop after a difficulty adjustment that makes hashes harder instead of easier.

You sound like some socialist trying to undermine individual choice because "we never really had it in the first place".
I listen to Vitalik when I want to. I don't listen when I don't want to. Reversing the DAO theft was a cause that appealed to the minds and hearts of most nodes and miners in the ecosystem. It was a democratic decision in the true sense of the term. Those who dissented were not forced to comply. They are now happily running their own blockchain.

Ahh, I see. I give her a new transaction offer after every micropayment, even if I don't expect her to accept any offer until our trading is done? I see that would work. I can't cheat her for anything except for the last microtransaction.

Some wallet app that makes me not lose my shit every time I transfer. Display some information about the address I transfer to before I click send. Date of last transaction it was involved in, etc.
Some customizability for country specific tax plugins would also be good

NOT an insult. This sub feels like being at a pub and celebrating  the PL gold with the entire Leicester 15/16 squad in July 2016. Feels like Washington's officer ball after annihilating Cornwallis at Yorktown. Feels like NASA's control room when Armstrong landed on the moon. Feels like victory and unlimited potential. Like I'm still 15 with a head full of dreams

You're correct about the 1st point, and, sadly, nearly correct about the 2nd point as well. People change, though

No, after meticulously re-reading your comments I'm 98 % sure *you* are confusing the notion of saving the Merkle root of a block's transactions and saving the actual transaction data.
What I've been arguing in this thread is essentially what Nakamoto argues in section 7 of the whitepaper. Read it, and I'm sure you'll understand. Me and Nakamoto agree that completely spent transactions (what I've called "orphaned transactions") can be discarded and completely forgotten. You think they can't.

This brings me back to why I would want to make this validation. If validation fails, what do I do? If validation *can't* fail because consensus protocol guarantees it, why do I bother?

We're discussing retarded laws in the first place. I know very well that the regulations are hostile to large groups of small investors.


Yeah this is why I think the North Koreans have the right recipe for good government. No matter who you're able to corrupt in Kim's staff, you're not fucking over any constituents, because there aren't any in the first place. Stroke of genius, really.
Why does it matter whether a corrupt board member fucks over the combined capital of 1000 investors or the capital of a single, large investor? And how is this problem different in the two scenarios?

If he pulled out, Ethereum would lose a talented developer. I also think he's good for the morale of the other developers. He definitively has some leverage with his threats

They either show up at the general assembly and use their votes to elect one or more board members to represent them, or they remain unrepresented and you can do whatever you want with their money. That's usually how it works, but it also depends on what bylaws you enact.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:45:58
Yes, this is _exactly_ it. The other commenter here suggests this is a true, but naive explanation. It is not naive. You hit it spot on.
(Aaaaaand the added fact that the US government will threaten you with violence and confinement unless you procure USD on their behalf, but I suppose similar violent threats could be made with BTC at some point in the future)
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:30:39
If it ever got to that point, you would be "buying USD", not "selling BTC".

If you discovered some error many, many blocks back in time, you'd have to hard fork into Bitcoin True™ or something, right? If you, upon inspecting the entire blockchain, discover an *old* inconsistency with the currently mined blocks, that would mean a mining majority has validated fraudulent transactions without the rest of the ecosystem caring. Like, if you *did* discover something wrong, what could you really do about it?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:44:58
But then you'd have to throw away the assumption that honest miners make the longest chain. If you found an *old* fraudulent transaction, and it has been buried under many, many blocks, then that is tantamount with Bitcoin dying. Nodes should discover this fraud when it happens, not by inspecting the historical archives.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:56:46
I don't need to make one. Turns out there already is one, and it's called Bitcoin Core &gt;0.11.

You're talking to the wrong crowd. I don't know whether you've noticed, but r/bitcoin is no longer the enlightened bastion of visionaries it once was. It has turned into an ideological shithole.

Orphaned *transactions*, not blocks. By orphaned transaction, I mean a transaction where none of the participating wallets contain any BTC anymore. If all the input wallets and output wallets of a transaction have a 0 balance, why does this transaction data need to be stored, and not only the transaction hash included in the Merkle tree?
I've in fact been interested in Bitcoin since 2014 and holding a university lecture on it tomorrow xD
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:12:48


Yes, but what would I *do* ? Accept the fact that Bitcoin has failed, because the current ecosystem embraces a fraudulent chain?


The premise in my second question was that Bitcoin consensus is *always* reliable, and that I can be sure no old, historical transactions were double spent, which I believe to be the actual case. Then I don't understand why I would bother with auditing the entire blockchain history.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:29:21
We may be talking past each other. Not sure...
I see the current, main branch of the blockchain growing before my eyes on blockchain.info. I think it's legit. However, I'm paranoid, so I download the *entire* blockchain all the way back to 2009, including orphaned transactions.
Upon verifying the chain, I discover a double spend in 2013. It turns out that the chain I see on blockchain.info is *fraudulent*, and I know this because I did my due diligence with the blockchain history.
Now what? Do I start a new fork that is not fraudulent, branching off from the last legit block in 2013? Like, when you download the entire blockchain for verification purposes, what are you actually going to do when you find a historical, double-spent transaction?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:48:57
I don't get your point. 100 shareholders pool their money and elect a single board member at the annual general assembly. The people working the startup only concern themselves with the board member. Whether the average joes are "worrying all the way to the top", skiing in the Alps, completing Nintendo game speed runs or whatever the fuck else they may be doing, is generally irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:48:34


If I'm going to hold this assumption to be true, why do I bother with downloading the historical blockchain with all transactions in the first place? I can't discover a double-spend because the ecosystem's consensus makes sure there are none, but I still download the entire blockchain, to check if there are double spends.
I know I need all the block *hashes* to ensure that no nodes are colluding to fake blockchain history, but I don't see why I need the orphaned transactions with each block.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:43:46


Damn that is beautiful. You're a true poet
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:18:46
It wouldn't provide any answers, as I'm pretty sure you understand.
I'm pretty sure the only good reason you have to download the entire old, transaction history of the Bitcoin blockchain, is to either
1. Discover everything is fine and main chain has been honest from 2009 until now
2. Discover that the bitcoin system started frauding years ago, and that the Bitcoin blockchain is doomed as an honest ledger
Scenario nr. 2 offers no remedy, except to give up on Bitcoin. The probability of scenario nr. 2 occurring, is so remote that I don't see why anyone should bother doing it. Sure, it appeals to the nerd inside me to single-handedly verify a 10 year old ledger, but it's not something anyone needs to do. In order to save HDD space, I *think* old, orphaned transactions can be permanently forgotten (but retaining their associated Merkle root) without compromising the integrity of the ledger. Satoshi Nakamoto agreed, as detailed in section 7 of his paper.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:16:17
You have, and no tax money collected by any state in the history of states has ever been collected without threats of violence.
If you don't think it's by force, try not paying your taxes and see what happens. If enforced, laws inherently, necessarily involve violence, or the threat of violence.
It's baffling that libertarian rethoric like this needs to be explained on this sub. The libertarians are gone, gone, and the speculators have consumed the entire scene.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:57:24
Bitcoin *hasn't* failed, but in the hypothetical scenario where I validate the entire blockchain history and find a double spend which the mainstream current blockchain has *accepted*, then bitcoin would have *failed*. My question is, *what* do I *do* if that was to happen? If there is nothing I could do, then why do I bother with validating the historical transactions in the first place?
It makes perfect sense to validate the more recent transactions, because then you are able to stop an eventual ongoing miner fraud and fork out an honest chain with good damage control. What I don't get, is why I would want to validate old, orphaned transactions, buried *way* back in the chain. It seems redundant information to me, except for people who want to investigate stuff.
