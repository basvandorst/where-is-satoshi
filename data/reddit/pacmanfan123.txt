Gonna throw my .02$ here and say that offline 'paper wallets' are a viable method for storing bitcoin long term. 
\-Use BIP38 to encrypt the private key with a phrase that only you and you loved ones know about. 
\-Store multiple copies of the paper wallet in multiple offsite locations. 
\-Couple that with stamping the keys on steel plates, and you've got storage to last a lifetime.
\-You'll have to decrypt the private key and sweep the wallet into another hot wallet to use it, but it's the safest by far. 
The tough part in generation of paper wallets is taking steps to make sure you do it safely via an offline computer.

That's part of the solution. I'm looking to know if there is an Off-The-Shelf product you simply plug into the wall that acts as a point of sale terminal where a clerk at a store can ring up a sale, generate a QR code, and the customer can scan the code and send a payment. sort of like one of these :

First, don't tell people how many BTC you have, it's irresponsible and dangerous.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:59:57
I love this idea, however it's not safe to send the private key over the internet, or to give it to someone else. The good news is that amazon sells anodized aluminum credit-card sized blanks, and I have a laser cutter. I'm going to make some for myself!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:30
Now, do the same for how many people are in the 1 million club - aka hodlers of 21 BTC.

Check mine out, I used anodized alum cards from Amazon, and my laser cutter. I modified the bitaddress wallet generator code:   - I ended up making a few more changes after I took this picture - like inverting the color of the QR code.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:33:36
It's a BIP-38 encrypted private key. It doesn't matter if people see it, because they don't know my 'Phrase that pays' to decrypt it. Perfectly safe. And yes, it's a test wallet anyway...

Yeah, I'm sure they could still do some sort of fractional reserve - provided that not every customer demanded their BTC all at once.

Best answer here. Personally, I'm chemically etching my backup seed words on stainless steal plates (BIP39 with  a passphrase) and making sure my family knows how to use it. Additionally, I've got multiple backups on off-site locations.

Well, a bankrun of a BTC backed bond would be payable in BTC, right? If people demanded their private keys for the amount of BTC that's 'backed', then the bank would have to pay up. They can't fake having more bitcoin on a bank run.

I think you're being a little generous with 'Easily transactable'. Bitcoin is not at this point, but it's getting better with secondary payment layers.

It can also prove the authenticity of a video shot at a certain point of time if someone later claims it's a deep-fake. I can see this being used as a verification tool for journalists.

What you're looking for is wallets that have any amount of bitcoin in them. All wallets technically already 'exist', some are in use and most are not. They are not recorded on the blockchain until they are used in a transaction.

 Lightning isn't centralized.  ..." even worse, banks could release 2nd layer scalability solutions like Lightning Network, diverting most users away from the main chain and ruining the decentralization of the Bitcoin economy " - No they couldn't. They could try, but the nice thing about bitcoin is that it would require everyone else to get onboard (Miners, Nodes, etc..) - that's not gonna happen.

Did Mycelium show any previous transactions? When you imported the seed, did it have a bip39 passphrase? Also did you import it as legacy. What program / service did you use to generate the seed in the first place? If you have the complete recovery word list, I'm sure the money is still there.
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:25:54

I'm sure it's going to spike somewhere above 20K, then rapidly drop back to approximately where it is now. My plan is to sell some at a high point soon to reap some profits, then buy it back after the dip.

It probably wasn't an accident. If the victim pays, why does the hacker care if they files are recovered on not?

Ugh, there are a lot of things wrong with this approach. I'd like to point out that you could probably implement a halfway decent lossless compression of the blockchain. Some magical 'AI' isn't going to do any better than a decent compressor when running up against Shannons law.
