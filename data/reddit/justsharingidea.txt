Well, it is hard to say where the exact equipment is located, but it is well known the circumstances for mining in China are more competitive due to almost free electricity.
So maybe not all hashrate in the Chinese pools originates from inside China, but likewise not all hashrate in the Global pools originates from outside china.
I think the event that more than 51% of the worlds hashing power originates from within Chinas borders has a pretty high probability
I even think that the event that more than 80% of the worlds hashing power originates from within Chinas borders has a pretty high probability.

That assumes that the miners will act to do the best thing for bitcoin without being forced to do otherwise.
The Chinese government is very powerful inside china, and all that mining equipment is inside chinas borders.
I think one important thing to realize is that decentralization of nodes is important, but even more important is geographic distribution of hashing power in separate jurisdictions.
If they shut down the hashing power then Bitcoin will easily survive, because it has been designed to automatically solve such events. But if they manage to organize efficiently and confiscate 80% of the networks hashing power and use it to purposely sabotage Bitcoin, then there is no mechanism in place that will defend against this.
What I am saying is, everyone focusses on a certain Mining pool getting too much power, but people are ignoring the fact that location of mining equipment might be much more important, since governments might be the main adversary of Bitcoin, not mining pool operators.

Is anyone interested in discussing this important issue?
