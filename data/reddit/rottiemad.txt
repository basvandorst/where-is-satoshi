Thanks for the replies and suggestions, I will have a look into it some more this evening.
Basically, my wages go into my bank at midnight every other Thursday! I need to place an 'order' that evening so my order is shipped Friday morning for a Saturday delivery!
This is why I require an instant service.
I did do a search and saw Kraken was an option, however I believe it takes a few days to get your BTC's. Is this still the case?
Some payments are as little as £8 but can also be anywhere upto £150 a time! I wouldnt be happy paying 40\50% in Fidor fee's
I have been happily making these regular payments without fuss or effort for almost 2yrs via Coinbase and Circle within 2 or 3 minutes utilising there app's or websites and my UK debit card!
Whenever I make a transfer out of my bank account using 'Faster Payments' I have to get out of bed (if on days) at around 12:30am, switch on and wait for my PC to boot up, sign into my bank account, set up the transfer, confirm the transfer, then I have to take a security call on my mobile phone and confirm that the payment was actually set up and made by myself............ all before the bank release my funds!
This is even trickier if I am working night shifts as I will now need to utilise work computers for personal business.
I have to of placed my order before 6:30am Friday morning to guarentee postage that day.
Why is it that only Circle and Coinbase could get it nailed on with mobile App's and debit cards? How hard can it be for the likes of Kraken et al to follow suit?
I have a Bittylicious account and have used them in the past, however just to use debit card its almost £70 more per BTC then to do a bank transfer! WTF...... WHY??
A UK debit card is no different to a bank transfer, its instant, cannot be double spent and cannot be spent if the funds are not available (every transaction fails with insufficient funds with debit cards)! The risk is zero to these companies that happily accept bank transfer&gt;
Or am I missing something?
Once again, thanks for listening to my rant and for the input guys and girls

Just to clear it up, I don’t want to use another altcoin as the host only accepts BTC and I always have a small supply of BTC in my wallet for other uses and just wanted to try something different this time.
I thought it was going to be a simple, pain free situation with relatively small (2%ish) fee’s

Thanks anyway

Can I ask what was so sensitive about it?
I’ve been using BTC ever since SR1 but for those reasons alone.
I thought I’d try and use it for more every day items since it has been on the news and in the press a lot recently and I’d assumed mass adoption was imminent.
Clearly that’s not the case.
Sorry I don’t understand the politics of it all and don’t really care, I just think Bitcoin is a pretty cool invention and I like what it represents and it’s usefulness.
Sorry if I’ve asked the wrong questions, I just kinda figured that’s what this sub was all about........ my bad I’ll go ask on Piston Heads next time shall I? ��

Probably because as above, it ends up a bch BTC debate when all I wanted was a simple answer.
Thank you kindly to those that kept on topic and provided helpful information.
Sorry I asked a controversial questions, I will do as suggested and find a friendlier more welcome place for a noob like myself ��
