Currencies fail because other countries speculate with them or withdraw support (like excluding certain countries from participating in capital markets or not letting them peg their currency to the USD.) Using Bitcoin is only an option for the educated elites right now though.

Let's not take the metaphor too far.  However, the USD is being undermined by transactions that don't involve it.  (Anyone who says it is stable because of the hard work of the American people or "because the USA always pays her debts!" simply does not understand how currencies work.)  OPEC and everyone on the Belt and Road except maybe Japan want to get rich without having to kowtow to the mighty USA.  Or the UK.  The USA likes to slam other countries by excluding them from the financial system.  Or, more accurately, the debt system.  Can crypto break this system built on so much inertia?  Or is crypto destined to be "just like gold"?  (Just like gold. Originally a standard, seized by the government, traded, hidden, lied about, and made to disappear.  It's not so great to be just like gold.)  Better to be like the USD in Cuba in the '90s, maybe?  HODL, but keep your eyes on the Road too.

This sounds like a great example of two things that appear to correlate but are just a coincidence.  As in, this population already had these traits. These traits were not caused by cryptocurrency.
