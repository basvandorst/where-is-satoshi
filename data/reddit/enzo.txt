Well, I thought this too, we can only wait to see if it's a regular occurrence.

If I'm on my laptop, it's always open so the tab displays the price. If I'm boarding I probably have a look every other chair lift on my phone widget.

Only if Electrum supports the Segwit coin (which I don't know if it will yet). I currently have my BTC in Electrum, but to get Bitcoin Gold I will need to copy my wallet over to the Bitcoin Gold Wallet to receive them. (whenever that bloody comes out)
As a rule of thumb, as long as you hold your BTC private keys you will be able to receive the same amount of 'fork coins' but not necessarily directly from Electrum. So No, in short.
