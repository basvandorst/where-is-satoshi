Thank you.  I had to rewrite it a few times as the editors needed me to more thoroughly explain words like blockchain, as well as to highlight the times when people have lost money (um, what investment has ever not had those times, including eBay, Google, Amazon, etc.).  I'm taking it on as my mission to bridge the gap between the bitcoinerati (I'm writing this from Hong Kong, where I just wrapped up speaking at Inside Bitcoins) and the mainstream investor, which should know better (and someday will).  This happened in the early days of the Internet (what do you mean, "cyber"??), too...

I generally reply to comments to a piece I write, but these were so ill-informed (snake oil, tulips, etc.), I figured it was best to not feed the trolls.  Aside from which, they don't allow me to comment on my own article unless I first subscribe to their papyrus edition, if I'm reading this correctly...

Thanks for your feedback.  We decided to open up the conference to offer the "non-grey-poupon" option with the BitAngels conference side-by-side and we did away with the invite only part (just didn't change the site language yet; we'll fix that shortly).  
The idea of making CoinAgenda high-end and somewhat exclusive was to attract the kind of folks who normally don't go to bitcoin conferences by making it more like a TED / ReCode / Goldman Sachs event, but the early feedback was that we should also make a no-frills option where the content and company presentations were the star and so we're offering both.

Beat me to the punch by four minutes, Ryan (ha).  Full disclosure: I'm an investor in Cryptex and I've also worked with Gyft (heck, and I just had dinner with Ryan) - both services are great for different reasons.  Gyft lets you save 3-4 percent on gift cards like Amazon that you'd be buying anyway by using Bitcoin (most of my Christmas presents were purchased this way), while Cryptex lets you put $1000 or so at a time on a card (with only ONE time you have to worry about the capital gain or loss - hello, IRS) - and then spend it just about anywhere without repeatedly hitting up the blockchain.
Net net: this is the easiest way to spend your crypto for everyday purchases - port it to the Cryptex debit card once, then spend it like it's cash.

BitAngels lets you invest in new Bitcoin startups - and use Bitcoins to do so:

Note that the description doesn't even use the word Bitcoin; it says it's investigating Silk Road.  Apparently, a lot of senators must think they're synonymous...

MtGox is completely irrelevant to owning a foreign security.  With MtGox, they were transferring money from US without the proper licenses.  All sorts of folks in the US legally own foreign stocks, real estate, currencies (e.g., euros).  The SEC only regulates foreign stocks to the degree they are being actively marketed to US investors and/or by US agents.
