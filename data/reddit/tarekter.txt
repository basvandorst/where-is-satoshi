On the contrary, my friend. What is often overlooked in shaving is the roll the handle plays in shaving. A lot of the razor burns, ingrown hairs, and irritation is due to using inferior handles. Club Parker handles are ergonomically designed and the balanced weighting is made to ensure a precise clean, even, smooth, shave. As opposed to plastic spheres from the biggest competitors.

And thanks for the tip!

Pretty funny blog post on why Club Parker is a no-brainer! 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:10:45
Fantastic!

The BTC are accepted for all 3 options. Mind you, the 3 dollar/month option is sold out. You could get 3 months of the Artist razor for $8/month equaling 0.26 BTC at the current BTC value.  
For those purchasing outside of the US or Canada, Club Parker will cover 50% of the excess shipping, and will request you cover the other half.

Thank you very much! We take great pride in the fashion and functionality combination of our products. 
With the bitcoin purchases, the way it is set up is a single order is worth a 3 month subscription. You will receive your package once a month, and at the end of every quarter, you will receive a request to renew your subscription for the next quarter and so on and so forth.

Club Parker delivers to anywhere in Canada, and to America upon request - exclusive to bitcoin purchases. We will be doing a full launch in the United States within the next few months. 
If you are in the United States and are using bitcoins, simply email help with your shipping address and we will reply with the cost and the wallet ID to send to.

Welcome to the club!

You're absolutely right, we cannot withdraw bits from your wallet unauthorized. The way we're setting it up right now for bitcoin purchases is each subscription order lasts for 3 months at a time. So you pay your 3 months down (approximately 0.33BTC for Atrist and 0.44BTC fir the Expert. At the end of the 3 months, you will receive an email requesting a membership renewal, if you so choose to do so (which we anticipate because.... well, the razors are awesome), then you will stay subscribed for another 3 months.

Razors ergonomic design are also optimal for manscaping ;) 
May be a little taboo to say, but oh well.

That's fair, everyone has their preferences. Club Parker is certainly planning on expanding the product line and has received several requests to add high end DE and single blade razors to the inventory. We will be doing so promptly and we will absolutely let everyone on Reddit know when it happens!

Well dear person who sent this out, 
This is very rude and I do not care for you very much kind Sir/Madam. I wish relatively unfortunate things upon you, of which include, but are not limited to; stubbing your toe, losing your debit card, getting a "D" on a math exam, impotence for a week or so, breaking your third favorite pair of glasses, stepping on leggos, ordering a steak but getting it too well-done, missing your bus, the power cutting out in your house for 72 hours, have a receding hairline, getting arthritis when you are 72, ripping your favorite shirt, and other things of that nature.

Offering services to anywhere in the world, just make an order at admin
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:04:10
Great question! 
We will be adding several more products on our line, we are just looking into what is most wanted. 
Here is what is on our list of additions: 
Shaving cream, after shave balm, preshave gel, shaving brush, shaving stand, single blade (barber shop razors), and yes, double edged safety razors will be included. 
Send us an email at admin with any requests you have and we will keep you posted on the development.

Thanks! Club Parker is not quite ready to do a full launch in the US, so we figured a good way to control our growth is to target the bitcoin market first. Plus, we are the only ecommerce site in the world that offers what we offer, (according to bitcoin directories) so we figured get out there while it's fresh! 
Also, upon personal requests and for a limited time, we are opening up the international market to all bitcoin buyer. Full details will be cited in the following post. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:54:47
For everyone within US and Canada, shipping is included in the price**
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:12:38
Yeah! Just select your razor, login, and on the checkout page select "Pay with bitcoins" Then fill out the shipping info and within the week you'll be shaving with your very own Club Parker razor!
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:48:58
Yes. That too. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:02:42
Club Parker update: Due to high demand, and an influx of emails requesting for us to offer our services internationally, we have decided to do so exclusive to bitcoin buyers. 
If you live outside of Canada, and would like to subscribe, email help with your shipping address, wallet ID, and your desired razor. ie Artist or Expert. 
We will then follow up with our wallet ID and price (advertised pricess will increase by half of what shipping is $2-5). Then within a week, you will be shaving with your own Club Parker razor! 
Happy shaving, Club members to be! Welcome to the club!

Really interesting read! As you all may know, I'm a huge supporter of BTC, but a good read nevertheless.
