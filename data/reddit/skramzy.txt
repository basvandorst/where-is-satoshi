Andy Bernard would like to have a few words with you about using Cornell's name is vain.

He said this in 2014, before bitcoin was fundamentally broken and when it had a use case.

Would selling my BTC on the site break my TOS with Coinbase? I'm not shooting for anything illegal, just possibly trying to make a few bucks off of my BTC. What they do with it afterwards is up to them, right?

Oh wow, what an obscure piece of knowledge.
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:10:27
Uhh I don't know how to break this to you, but Bitcoin is legitimately that expensive to use in small amounts. That's not shilling, it's a fact that even the BTC community reluctantly understands.
You know, you don't need to pretend that Bitcoin has no issues at all in order to support it. It does have issues, and admitting they exist is not a bad thing.

The paranoia that every other crypto in existence is a threat to/out to kill bitcoin is laughably ridiculous. Many coins do different things that have nothing to do with bitcoin's use case.

Then Rodger Ver showed up at his door not an hour later and handed over his crisp paper wallet and private keys. Said that since this totally real pizza guy who had only heard of bitcoin in passing said it's going to hit 1 million dollars per BTC anyway, he's done pushing for BCH.

This is very binary thinking. Bitcoin being first by no metric means it's 'the best' or 'better' than anything.

Great, another paranoid bitcoin enthusiast who thinks that every other coin in existence is out to kill bitcoin.
Please explain how Ethereum is a knock off of Bitcoin - I'd love to read your flimsy parallels. 
They have completely different use cases. If your argument is focused on that they both use blockchain, then by that logic anything that uses electricity is copying the lightbulb.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:08:34


That was the point you've been arguing, but let's pretend that you were making the vaporware argument this whole time.


That is the first paragraph of the Ethereum whitepaper. If you quickly scan it you can see that it has delivered everything it intended to, which in no way constitutes vaporware. You really shouldn't throw around terms you don't understand - vaporware is a concept that never actualizes. Ethereum is real, and blockchain is a very young technology.
If you're calling Ethereum fraudulent, a knock-off, and vaporware because dApps haven't immediately exploded in a space that is still finding it's bearings... you clearly have some insecurities about your portfolio's future.
Ethereum isn't going to hurt your bitcoin holdings. Don't be afraid to read a little, and have some patience.

User &gt; bitcoin &gt; RSK
User &gt; Eth+Ethereum 
RSK is a fee-taking middleman for something that has already been done cheaper and more efficiently by other platforms. RSK only exists because of the outcry of bitcoin fanatics trying to futiliy prove that with enough layered solutions, bitcoin can do something it was never designed to, more expensively than necessary.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:27:08


RSK is shipped with scaling problems. Plasma is an answer to Ethereum's.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:48:16
We're not talking about the current adoption rates of mainnet dApps - focus up. We're talking about how Ethereum and Bitcoin are fundamentally different technologies.
If you're unable to understand how a **blockchain reliant currency that doesn't have the ability to act as a platform** and a **blockchain reliant development platform that doesn't focus on people trading their token** aren't gunning for each other's use case, then you should leave crypto before somebody sells you a bridge.
Not everything is out to kill Bitcoin and keep you from retiring before you're 30, so relax man. Do some research and understand that blockchain is bigger than your pissing contest of Bitcoin vs. all.
If you're genuinely interested in learning about some amazing dApps built on the Ethereum mainnet, these two are my favorite:
[Request Network (REQ)](
[Bloom Protocol (BLT)](
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:17:53
I see what you're getting at, but the challenges are not exactly the same for Ethereum as they are for RSK. RSK is a 3rd party platform that can consume bitcoins and spit them out as fuel for smart contracts with additional (purportedly high) transaction fees. It's also not likely that bitcoin devs will ever work with RSK for better implementation.
Ethereum requires no 3rd party to do this. RSK aims to facilitate 100 tx/s, while Ethereum's second layer solution, Plasma, will allow initiatives like OmiseGo to facilitate 1,000,000 tx/s. Ethereum developers also work with implementing Plasma, giving that scaling solution direct support &amp; integration from the developers of the platform it was designed to work alongside.

Donald Trump's 10 year old son has computers. He's amazing with them. We should put him in charge of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:36:28
No 3rd party collecting additional fees, i.e one of the the core pillars of decentralization and blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:21:30
RSK provides smart contracts for an extra fee in a permission only network and uses bitcoin as the ledger of record. The federated consensus runs the two way peg and uses Bitcoin as a currency. It really has very little to do with Bitcoin itself.
Bitcoin is does not possess the inherent ability to run Smart Contracts or dApps without a 3rd party platform that only uses it as payment. Which is again, completely okay.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:06:52
Bitcoin's core use case is digital p2p currency. Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and dApps. The fact that it's tokens can be used as a p2p currency is nothing more than a result of the token being necessary to power these things. Currency is not Ethereum's primary directive.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:48:37


Because you're using the term vaporware in a categorically incorrect way. I'll reiterate for you again - vaporware is a concept that never actualizes, Ethereum's tech is actively working. I'm not sure how else to explain to you that you're using the word completely wrong.


... no. Just no. Bitcoin is a currency, not a platform. See the distinction between the two in one of my previous comments. Where are you getting that information? Anybody who understands all the amazing things that Bitcoin can facilitate knows that it's not a platform. That's not a negative thing, it's just not what it was meant to do by design. No dApps, no smart contracts. It's a currency - please go out of your way to understand that.
Say it with me, "*Bitcoin is not a platform, bitcoin is a currency*"


That's fine, but know that calling things you don't agree with/understand "fraudulent" heavily diminishes your credibility as an objective investor.
For somebody who claims to not be married to bitcoin, you're sure quick to openly throw around false capabilities that it doesn't have to make it sound better. By design, Bitcoin cannot do what Ethereum does from a development perspective - and that's okay, **because they're completely different.**

Ether CAN be used as a p2p currency, but that's off base of it's purpose.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:57:25
I agree. The fanboy mentality of feeling threatened by any other crypto is harmful to it as a technology. Some have different use cases than others -- they're not all out to be "BTC killers" -- they're building on an existing idea and protocol for further the use, potential, and scale of crypto as a whole.
That's like hating the smartphone because you used a computer first.
For people that jumped on a relatively new technology so quickly and intensely,  many of them are sure scared of change.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:06:11
Ethereum is not gunning for Bitcoin's place as a digital peer to peer currency. It's ideology is fundamentally different.
They're both cryptocurrencies with different purposes.
