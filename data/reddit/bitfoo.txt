In order for this to be taken even remotely seriously, the author needs to write an article which succinctly states the **facts**, **proofs**, and **numbers** which describe a potential exploit.

I used to work for a company that had around 50-100 Zareason desktop computers as their primary workstations. People seemed happy with them. Never had any experience with support or returns myself though.

Seems to have worked in their second attempt! Let's hope it works faster the next time.

Sorry I can't help with this, but I love your show and will look forward to the Planet Money episode about Bitcoin!

What were your previous btc projects? Publicizing them might help your credibility a bit.

I probably would too. In fact I just installed the SpiderOak client and am evaluating it thanks to the OP.

They can be used to create M-of-N multi-signature or escrow transactions. I believe there's a live implementation of a multi-sig wallet at

"Bitcoin: totally untraceable."
The pictured device is supposed to be a Bitcoin wallet of some kind, in the year 2048. It contains "4999" currency units (hopefully Satoshis!), and was unfortunately being used to pay for an illegal synthetic organ transplant.

I recently visited the Kreuzberg area in Berlin which has a bunch of bitcoin-accepting stores. You can get accommodation, food, beer, coffee, and even records:

Paid about 14 hours ago, still no "third email", and no credit on my account either. (Testing the waters with a T-Mobile $10 topup).

That's pretty scary: I'm sorry for your loss. But maybe you could prevent this from happening to others by providing some more information. Were you running a custom ROM on your phone? If so, which one? What other apps were on your phone, especially ones with superuser access?

Sleek website. But how is your exchange rate computed / what's your overhead? I've been using  to buy Amazon gift cards for quite some time now, and their exchange rate is much more favorable. ($29.67 vs $27.81 at the moment). Unless you can at least match that, I see no reason to switch, especially to a new and untrusted competitor.
