You can't, by definition, purchase anything anonymously with a credit card. Credit cards have names on them. So, you can't do that anywhere.

Gavin's independent verification procedure per 
1. Gavin provided arbitrary string to sign (good).
2. Signature was copied to a clean usb Gavin provided (good).
3. Gavin verified signature on a "brand new" laptop (good).
4. The "brand new" laptop was provided by Wright (fucking horrible).
5. Gavin was not allowed to keep laptop or usb (are you fucking serious).

Looking forward to it. Eligius had always been my favorite pool. Hope the instance of bad luck doesn't change anything.
Any chance there was/is a competitor (posing as a miner) discarding found blocks to try and hurt the pools stats? Notice any anomalies in hash power or multiple conections coming from the same place? Not saying that's what happened, but it would only take a few malicious Phs to seriously disrupt the pool. Any clients submitting shares slower than their hash rate would indicate they whould be (evidence they are checking diff before sending)?

The whole point of this fucking system is eliminating trust from the equation. Trust no one, verify everything. It’s that easy.
I don’t care if the real Satoshi comes back on a flying horse and signs a picture of his birth certificate with he genesis block, it changes nothing. 
He already gave the world Bitcoin, and that transfer can never be reversed.
