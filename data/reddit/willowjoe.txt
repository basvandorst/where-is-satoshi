So how did the above poster get charged a fee and you didn't with the same card? Are you able to churn/get rewards on your B of A Visa at 1% with a 0% credit card fee on Circle?

Which Chase Card? Freedom/INK/CPS?

I'm all about coinbase since I trust it but it takes soooo long for it to process.  Purchases made today won't go through until next week.  But it's at $580 so buy buy buy!!!

Like... "Bros" or "bros"? So confusing when were speaking of actual brothers.

I've been waiting a month for it to drop this low.  It's like BTC is on sale.  I bought it today at $645, then again at $595.  I'll buy all the way down for the next day or so.

Has anyone tried an alternative card?
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:06:28
CoinBase. But it's more of a hosted wallet than an exchange.  However, your money is relatively more secure than dodgy MtGox and eastern europe based BTC-E.

Mr. Gox is just stuffing his pockets full of absconded bitcoins. I imagine all the Mt. Gox people look like Rich Uncle Pennybags.

1. sell now and lock in your losses after a bad day that has nothing to do with BTC itself
2. hold on for it to return to equilibrium
Your call.

do I get a couple upvotes or a bitcoin donation for being correct?  or does being right mean that my comment will get downvoted into oblivion?

I'm not going to pretend either. Just an observation of the recent fluctuations and daily averages/movement (coinbase).
It seemed most stable at about $700. I bought in last month at $590 and sold at $710. Not trying to make a mint, just a predictable and conservative profit.

And a TL;DR of the TL;DR.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:08:18
$550 at the lowest.  Keep buying it on the way down.  It'll be in the $700s next week.  MtGox and SR2.0 have nothing to do with the currency itself.  MtGox was always risky and SR2.0 went the way of many other darknet markets before it.  No surprises here.  But it's time to lock in cheap positions.

So... can we start DrunkCoin already?

Reach to the right and jerk it. Kinda weird if you're just beating yourself off in front of a bunch of people.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:23:56
I doubt you act like that towards people IRL. Calm down.

The excuse of stealing to prevent others from stealing is a weak defense.  The intent to permanently deprive would be provable despite his later actions/excuses.  The theft would focus on the other elements as well: the trespassory taking of the personal property of another [with intent to permanently deprive].
What if everyone said that they were just "holding" property of another when they are caught/feel guilty?  It would not negate the completed criminal act.
TL;DR - He stole it. But cool story bro.

Down vote them to their face?
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:58:40
they scare me

Sound advice.  I'm checking the charts and haven't found any predictable correlation besides the bearish selloffs on the news.  Short of some magical hack, I don't think the news can get much worse than what happened in China.  If anything, it shows how much value BTC can hold after a setback.  I think it can only be up, especially when some type of x-mas/BTC hype or smoother trading takes hold.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:40:38
I'm with your exact sentiment.  I have no hard facts but based on the news, it's a good time to buy.  I have no problem with people investing/speculating in it as long as there are no scams.  I'll only buy low now until it's not so volatile, then I can use it to buy things IRL.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:02:30
You're right, it is time to buy (a wee bit). I think if it would have totally crashed, it would have been much more sudden and steeper.  This is absorption of bad news/correction.
