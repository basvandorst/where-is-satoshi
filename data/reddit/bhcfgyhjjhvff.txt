Did they also have a screen and keyboard and spend hours hacking away while concealing their activity? Or rather was it a headless computer just jacking into the ethernet with all the actual hacking done from outside the jail? (Other than the initial installation that is).. Might not have been installed by prisoners either.

Good to keep options open, but if LN is a success there will probably be no need to increase blocks on litecoin. Instant confirmation and very low fees are still useful even when blocks aren't full.

This is basically how UASF is activated.. Some subset of miners will stop building on top of the non-segwit miners blocks after the flag day.

Basically it means that under segwit the fee for a transaction with multiple inputs and one output, or perhaps two is less than the fee for a transaction with one input and multiple outputs. It remains to be seen how much this helps motivate people to reducing transaction outputs. I suppose its probably a bit better but there are still lots of reasons to create utxos

A few months maybe. You can still deposit to their EUR acct although your bank will likely take 2.5% in conversion. If you open a fidorbank.UK account that makes a good conduit to reach EUR exchanges more efficiently.. £2.49 per transfer and near spot fx rates.
