But I assume it's like steam trading where the individual transactions of inter-player gambling and trading are all zero-fee, no tax, and no regulation aside from whatever the game publisher decided.

Bitcoin is great for small players to exchange digital goods where chargebacks are a significant hazard.
My first bitcoin purchases were buying tf2 hats from people.

Make sure you encrypt your wallet with a long password.
Make sure you never forget your password.
Make sure you back up your wallet.dat file regularly (AFTER encryption).
Make sure you avoid things like stearncornmuunity.ru.exe

The user-to-user bot-assisted item trading site  recently added bitcoin support. [Many sellers there offer tradable giftable games for bitcoin.](
(The site manages transactions with their own middleman bots, so you don't need to worry about individual sellers scamming you)

1. Make sure you educate yourself on securely setting up a wallet. I'd personally recommend Blockchain.info as a nice online beginner's wallet for amounts less than $1000.
2. Make sure the buyer goes first (unless he has massive reputation (real reputation, not just a bunch of +reps on his profile)).
3. Enjoy the zero-chance-of-chargeback (which I'm sure you're familiar with as a prominent risk in steam item trading with paypal).

Practically anyone who lists public trades of steam items typically gets periodic friend requests from scammer-run bot accounts.
The bot usually says: "Hi. Hey my friend wants to trade with you but can't add you for some reason. Can you add him? His profile is: stearncornmuunity.com/id/someguy"
Upon visiting the site, you're prompted to download and run an exe "for security reasons", or depending on browser security, an executable or java program is run automatically.
Running code from untrusted sources can lead to scammers spying on and controlling your computer, which is enough to let them commandeer your email, steam inventory, and wallet.

The internet needs a chargeback-free currency for shit like steam item trading. What would you recommend instead?

Been with bitcoin since 2012. My older money misses the days of small fees (back when the tech was useful) and thinks the scaling should have been solved years ago instead of given the Half-Life 3 treatment, even if it meant fewer nodes.

Not sure if you're clear on this: You only need to backup after generating addresses. Sending money to a wallet address does not change the data of the wallet.
Put another way: The amounts of money are stored safely and very redundantly in the peer-to-peer cloud of thousands of machines. The wallet data (only accessed by you) merely contains the keys that can authorize transfers of amounts.
If you know the address, you can check the balance on a site like blockchain.info since it's public knowledge.
