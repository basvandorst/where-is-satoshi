The thing about ChangeTip is that the receiver doesn't need to be formerly acquainted with or have knowledge of bitcoin to start accepting it. The only problem you can have with tipping someone on YouTube is if they don't have a Google+ profile set up. This just makes it harder to search for their name when tipping.

The tip is cancelled and returned to you after a week if the person doesn't collect. Until that time you can always cancel it from the ChangeTip site. If your comment is spam filtered, then the bot can't see your tip so the tip isn't delivered.

William Shatner decided to open his wallet for a tip of one bit. It's less about the amount sometimes with that initial tip and more about the demonstration that you can send money in a social media blurb. A lot of the time people react to that demonstration alone in a very postitive manner, and they often appreciate the sharing of knowledge.

I saw the potential for that phenomenon many months ago, and that is a big part of the reason why I decided to join the ChangeTip team. Say what you will, ChangeTip provides a service that will result in increased bitcoin adoption in the short and long-term, and that is something we all look forward to for obvious reasons. I predict that the use of the social media layer as a bitcoin conduit will have profound implications on the global economy and culture. I really look forward to how ChangeTip and bitcoin might help us leave this world a better place than we found it.

Recently, the usefulness of a bitcoin tipbot in advancing adoption has been severely limited by its restriction to Reddit. This is no more. Bitcoin can now be sent across multiple social media channels. Reddit, YouTube, Google+, and Twitter can all be used as bitcoin conduits. For the love of all that is holy if you realize how gamechanging that is, then please join me in the new crusade to spread bitcoin adoption in a way that has never been done before! There is no sliver or possibility of failure that I can comprehend with this tool.
Edit: Did I mention celebrity outreach? I see that someone was able to get William Shatner, Snoop Dogg, and Wil Wheaton set up with a ChangeTip wallet. If that is possible then the war has already been won. We just need a few visible celebrities to tip a few times before the inevitable cascade begins. We are so close. Join me in this!
