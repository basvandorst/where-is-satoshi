None of these secure data storage / fraud prevention / data integrity applications being put on a block chain and tokenized will amount to any new wealth creation. They are without exception a tool to transfer wealth from confidence men and confidence men who don't know they're confidence men to unsophisticated retail investors whose greed is greater than their understanding. The retail investors buy into their pitches because they see the valuation of Bitcoin and these tokens come wrapped in the trappings of Bitcoin. Much to their chagrin, these tokens possess none of the monetary properties that give Bitcoin its value and they are fleeced of their hard-earned savings.

"liberal", as in the original sense that grew out of the Enlightenment (i.e. the liberal values of holding up democracy, a protection of natural rights, and the rule of law as cornerstones of civilization).

Anyone know if this is any good? If anyone with sufficient knowledge to be able to judge the quality has read it yet?

I see many posts in this thread complaining about the fees OP charges to provide this service.
For anyone familiar with the points of friction in the industry—and where the foreign exchange risk costs come into play—it is evident that this service is a monumental improvement to the Bitcoin ecosystem and many would benefit from its provision.
If the fees of one particular service are too high for your particular use case, use a different service. If you think you can provide the same service at a lower cost, the rest of the Bitcoin community implores you to do so. Cypherpunks write code.

I don't have them plugged into Blockfolio. I just use the app to more easily keep track than constantly going to coinmarketcap.com.
