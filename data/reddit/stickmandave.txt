I think you've misunderstood.  It wouldn't relieve Gox of ANY debt, just allow that debt (which already exists) to be traded at whatever rate the market sets.

I think you've misunderstood something.  This plan wouldn't give Gox a cent.

Are you suggesting that bitcoin miners are as oblivious to and uninterested in new developments in bitcoin software as average computer users are to developments in browser software?
Because I don't think they are.  I think that anybody running a full node is paying attention to this stuff.

'Tis the season when those of us with electric heat start mining to subsidize out heating bills.  That may have something to do with it.

Lol.  I'd say DO oversimplify it, and tell your audience that you're doing so.  Bitcoin is a paradigm-shifting kind of thing, and the technical details of how it all works are the least important thing about it, from a casual users standpoint.
My brother makes his living teaching people how to give presentations.  Rule  he says, is to base the presentation on what the audience wants to know and will find interesting, not what the presenter knows and finds interesting.  We had a talk about this when i tried to describe bitcoin to him.  He pointed out that since I have an engineer brain, I started out by trying to explain how bitcoin works.  This just ended up confusing and annoying him, since he doesn't have an engineers mind, and thus doesn't really care how it works.  What he was interested in was what bitcoin was good for.  
You're probably a geek of some sort, as am I.  To us, the inner workings of bitcoin are cool and interesting.  Most people are NOT geeks.  They don't care how the technology works; they just want to know what it's good for.
   A general audience wondering what this bitcoin thing is all about don't need or want to know about encryption/key pairs/cryptographic methods any more than they want to know about the inner workings of their car, computer, or cell phone.   They just need to know that it's based on encryption, and that the worlds cryptogeeks have been all over it and found it to be secure.   
If it's not a technical audience, I'd omit any technical details that are going to make your audience's eyes glaze over.  They're not there to learn bitcoin how works; they're there to find out what bitcoin is, how it might be useful to them, and how it might affect society.

Yep.  In winter, if you have electric heat, mining is basically free.  In summer, if you have AC, you pay twice; you pay for the power to mine, which turns into heat, then you pay to pump that heat out of your house.

Sure they can.  Try being a waiter and not paying tax on your tips.  Or anyone convicted of tax evasion because they were spending more money than they were claiming they made.

Using paypal does not ensure you'll get paid.  If the buyer is a scammer, and complains to paypal that he didn't get the coins, paypal will very probably reverse the transaction, and you're out of luck.
@_date: 2011-06-14 03:16:10
The same way taxes on cash transactions are enforced.  Incompletely, and with penalties if they catch you cheating.
The way i look at it, all bitcoin does is allow website businesses to accept cash, just like their bricks and mortar cousins.  Businesses still have to keep records, and these records can be audited.

I wouldn't hire either of those anonymously either.  Who would?
@_date: 2011-09-16 01:24:40
I don't see the advantage for the customer.  You may not be a lawyer.  I may not be guaranteed confidentiality as I would with a lawyer.  Why would I risk hiring you instead of a real life lawyer?
If the answer to this is that you charge less than the cheapest lawyer I can find, you just made me even more suspicious of your credentials.  
I just can't see how you could convince me, or anyone else, that hiring you is the smart choice.
@_date: 2011-06-14 08:10:22
Yeah.  Instead of 260 Mh/s on a single pool, I have 130 running on each of two pools.  If one pool goes down, the other miner instantly jumps to 260.

@_date: 2011-06-11 16:55:36
Bought 2 a few days ago at $30... and am laughing at myself now.
Have mined 2, and am continuing at 260Mh/s.
I'm treating this as a bet on a retirement fund.  Years from now, if bitcoin succeeds, they'll be worth a nice sum.  If it fails, they'll be worthless.  There's enough stress in my life already without sweating over daily market fluctuations. 
handy info:  If you're making a small purchase (each purchase seems to be limited to $40.00, though you can make multiple orders), you can buy bitcoins with paypal at [youtipit.](  The fraud-prevention catch is you can't withdraw these coins from the youtipit system for 45 days.

Check out this [comparison of mining pools](
I went with bitcoinpool and btc Guild; the two highest hashrate free pools.  No server is up 100% of the time, so i run a miner for each.  If and when one pool goes down, the other miner takes up the slack.
@_date: 2011-12-19 21:57:25
Would someone care to explain the significance of this?
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:39:01
Well, it about 20 times the value it was a year ago, so another 5 fold increase in 3 months wouldn't be too surprising.
I'm not saying it will happen, but as an estimate, it's neither delusional nor insane.
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:08:33
Only bitcoin fans care what bitcoin is all about.  If bitcoin is to succeed, it will do so by being adopted by people who don't know or care what bitcoin is all about, but simply find it convenient.

When I ran a business that accepted credit cards, i was paying a 4.5% commission.  Included in the contract, though, was a clause forbidding me to charge more for credit card purchases than for purchases using other payment methods.  So right now, a merchant passing along the savings when a customer pays with bitcoin risks being cut off by the credit card companies.  
Don't expect bitcoin discounts any time soon.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:18:01
It's divisible to 8 decimal places.  0.00000001 bitcoin is called a Satoshi.  When bitcoins cost $100,00 each, a Satoshi will be worth a penny.
As I understand it, if and when it's required, bitcoins could be made even more divisible.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:26:06
Just for reference, that's about 270 days worth of blocks.  Given that the people holding them have probably already cashed out millions of dollars, they probably just haven't gotten to them yet.

I saw it as having a significantly better than 1% chance of increasing 100 times, which made it a good bet. 
It DID go up a hundred times!   
  I STILL see it as having a much greater than 1% chance of increasing to 100 times the current value.  In fact, the odds look better now than when i made the first bet.

It's a bubble for sure; the price is doubling every 2 weeks or so.  If this bubble acts like the last two, though, we can expect the price to reach about 20x the pre-bubble price before crashing to half that.  That would be a pre-Christmas crash to about $1300.  I can live with that.
Disclaimer: I don't really know what I'm talking about.

Good question.  I just moved some coins out, and the new fee was described on the withdrawal page, and was deducted from my withdrawal.  
   
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:15:32
Again, so what?  Given that Bitcoin is not in any way controlled by it's creator, what does it matter who created it?  If it turns out to have been written by the US Federal Reserve, how is its utility any different than if it were created by the hacker group Anonymous?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:49:59


Given that it's open source and in no way controlled by Satoshi, why does Satoshi's identity have anything at all to do with anything?

Check the Nov 28th announcements, or go to the "withdraw bitcoins" page.  They're claiming it goes to the miner, but it's 10 times higher than any transaction fee I've ever included.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:24:37


Yeah, I wonder if people stay because they like paying 10% extra when they buy, or enjoy the fact they can't get their money out when they sell?
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:12:16
yes, because when you're holding a million bitcoin, the you need a shady scheme to guarantee future wealth!

I'd say that makes it analogous to [Tulip bulbs](  Unless it turns out to be actually useful and used (as a payment system, or for international transfers, etc) then eventually it will crash and become worthless.

I bought in at the peak of the bubble, then watched the crash.  I was such an idiot, I thought!  All that money down the drain!  
It was 2011, and I'd just bought in at $32.  I'm glad I didn't double down on my mistake by panic selling.

I don't know what you're seeing, but it seems to me the proportion of media reports that are positive has never been higher.  And as usual, most of the negative reports seem to be written by people with an incomplete or incorrect idea of what bitcoin is and how it works.   
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:46:50
Mega-sat's and kilo-sat's work for me!  "satoshi" is so much easier to abbreviate than bitcoin, especially since "bit" and "coin" are already things, so using either of them as the abbreviation would only lead to confusion. 
edit: also, people are more familiar with the prefixes "kilo" and "mega" than they are with "milli" and "micro", especially in the US, where ~~people are dumb~~ they don't use metric.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:00:50
I'm OK with this bubble behaving just like the last two; that would put this current one peaking at $2000, then crashing to $1100 or so.
And note that the time between bubbles is decreasing.  The next one will be along soon enough.
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:47:43
Bitcoin doesn't lose it's qualities; nobody's forcing you to use a middleman.  People will use a middleman when the convenience is worth the extra cost.  This is as it should be.  Middlemen provide a valuable service, or they wouldn't exist.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:30:50

I was checking out the 2 year price graph at bitcoinity, with a logarithmic vertical axis.  Funny thing, if you smooth out the booms/busts, the line curves up.  Not only is Bitcoin growing exponentially, but the exponent itself is also increasing!
BTC is up about 50 times since this time last year, so, barring some sort of natural limit or catastrophe, I expect a BETTER that 50 fold increase in the next year.  Perhaps much better.
It sounds absurd, but so did thousand dollar coins a year ago. 
Then again, what do i know?

Expect massive surges.
Expect massive crashes.
Don't panic.
Don't worry about the short term.  It'll just make you crazy.  
Bitcoins potential remains the same, whether today's prices are climbing or falling.  Next year at this time you wont remember or care if the value rose or fell 20% today.

No, it's 2 facts.  It would only be a connection if there was something connecting them.  See how that works?
I was interested early on, too.  I guess that proves I'm connected to the CIA right? ;)
If the CIA were somehow involved with creating, operating, or controling bitcoin, they'd hardly need Anderson to come teach them about it, would they?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:34:46
Nothings certain, but it's a definite possibility.  It all depend on what bitcoin ends up being used for. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:11:06
In the immediate future, I think of bitcoin as a payment system, rather than a currency.  When you make a purchase, an app buys and sends bitcoins, and the vendors app receives and instantly sells them.  Anyone holding bitcoins at this point is engaging in currency speculation, which most individuals and businesses have no interest in.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:08:54
I have the opposite view.  99.9 percent of people don't give a crap about supporting bitcoin, and have no interest in learning about it or buying any.  I think the services most needed now are ones that simply use bitcoin in the background to make transactions easier.  
People would use an app for their phone that lets it work like a debit card, but with lower fees.  Most wont know or care that it uses bitcoin to do so.
As long as people need to know about bitcoin to use bitcoin, it wont go anywhere.    
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:21:24
What's that got to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:13:27
Obviously exponential growth can't continue forever.  The question is when it will stop.  I've assumed that price increases were driven by exponentially more people hearing of Bitcoin, seeing the potential, and getting into the market.  The rate at which this is happening seems to be increasing.  Knowledge of bitcoin seems to be going mainstream, even if use isn't yet.  I would expect the number of people in the market to continue rising fast for some time.
But, as i say, what do i know?  This is not my area of expertise.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:19:00


Ok, whatever.  Sounds like bullshit to me, but lets assume the fed created bitcoin.  How does that bit of news in any way change the utility, value, or future of bitcoin?  You imply that we should trust bitcoin less if it was created by the government, and i just don't see why.
