I love how we can actually see one of your work not to far from here, on Street View (same street).

Too bad you gave the whole picture.
It's easy to find thanks to what is on the right side: name of the company and street number:
105 Rue d'Aubervilliers, 75018 Paris, France   
[  
And too bad I can only go back to Paris in 3 weeks...  
Anyway, this is *génial* (*en français dans le texte*).
