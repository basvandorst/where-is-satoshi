edit: I was agreeing with the comment above and am backing him up
*"Bitcoin is not a currency and shouldn't be viewed as such. Those who invest in bitcoin should accordingly be aware of the risks it poses and protect their investment."*

Gotta know how to cook a book to cook a book. There's no cookbook for it.

Probably because 1) it's not Christmas so no one got the tune and 2) Ver'y reads outloud like "vare-ay' and 3) it doesn't rhyme well :/

It's a colloquialism

I think a lot of people forget that the government of the United States and many, many other countries have the largest fear of security threats are hard to regulate. Climate change, for example, is a much bigger security threat to global and domestic security than terrorism. It should be no surprise that an anonymous, self-regulating currency would be seen as something very scary to any prudent strategist.

Your claim is entirely ancedotal.

I respect that.
But you're also perpetrating a dangerous stereotype.
[UK 2016 "Better quality cocaine fuelling middle class drug use"](
[UK 2012 "Surgeons, teachers, nurses and other professionals should be randomly tested for cocaine use to stem the booming trade in the drug, Britain’s most senior policeman has suggested."](
[UK 2017 "Middle-class cocaine users funding slavery and murder"](
[UK 2017 "Crack is back – so how dangerous is it and why is its use on the up?](
[United States 2017 Cambridge Study "Adolescents from upper middle class communities: Substance misuse and addiction across early adulthood"](
[United States 2009 "While the associations between drug use overall are weak, the patterns for marijuana and cocaine are significant. Take the creative class: both marijuana and cocaine use are positively and significantly related to states with higher concentrations of the creative class."](
[India 2013, "How Cocaine is transitioning from a snob-drug to a middle-class snort](
Just because you don't know anyone who's middle class using cocaine, doesn't mean there's not a global shift across the world's middle class.

Can I ask why it takes *a few days*?

It's called "making yourself the victim"
