Okay, but what if the price of bitcoin DOESN'T go higher? What if it goes lower? Is she aware that is also possible or did you sell her some promises that aren't actually necessarily true?

Do you even know what stocks are? Or why people buy them? Or is this one of those things where we make a bunch of posts then you admit you didn't know people were doing anything but just random speculation with stocks or what the point of stocks were. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 16:17:42
The answer is that that is officially undefined in the bitcoin protocol and the fact transactions don't just rebroadcast forever is just a quirk of the current implementation and is not something any design should count on (although for some reason virtually everything acts like it's a guarantee). 
@_date: 2016-04-07 18:34:07
How are any of those people early adopters of a currency? Are you just mixing up all your talking points? 
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:59:14
Wow! with all that processing power the bitcoin network must be able to handle a ton of transactions!

The specific things it offers are only an advantage to people with a very ultra specific set of values and detriments to 99% of people with any other set of values. 
Only a few thousand people worldwide are finding "be your own banK' a thing they'd like to be
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:46:01
Then isn't bitcoin doomed? if only the ultra smart like yourself can use it? 
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:31:32
I am pretty sure that 99% of the things bitcoin people claim bitcoin can do are the exact things iceland does NOT want right now at this moment after the reasons for the last prime minister being kicked out.

That is a really dumb claim. Bitcoin is already 7 years old. Someone who is 20 years now was 13 when it came out. And that will never ever get better. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 01:38:58
The people that told you that "good news" somehow translated into people giving you more US dollars for your bitcoin were just lying to you because they wanted to sell their bitcoin to you. No law of economics says you get a payout from some abstract "good news". 
@_date: 2016-04-28 16:33:34
makes sense that bitcoin is a distant side thing in a pay by credit card scheme that has bitcoin shoehorned in as a small alternative option.

@_date: 2016-04-21 01:13:34
It's only the bitcoin community that thinks the obituary page is some sort of sick burn. To normal people if you say "bitcoin is dead" and someone shows you 500 other people saying it too they take it as "oh, this is a common and popular opinion a lot of people agree with me on" and not "oh no I am defeated because someone else agrees with me!" 
@_date: 2016-04-20 16:47:12
also it hasn't been released
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:13:16
okay, yeah, I got it, I was right. You actually didn't know what stocks are or why people want them more when there is "good news". 
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:06:58
Bitcoin has been on family guy, the simpsons, in several movies, on the cover of newsweek. etc etc etc. It is as mainstream as can be. 
But the bitcoin community is going to do that thing jack chick tracks do where they pretend the reason people aren't christian is because they just haven't ever heard about jesus yet and not that they have heard of him and just said "nope".

how high? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:02:11

What will this do to the constant claim that the reasons no one use Bitcoin is that it's too obscure and no one knows about it?
@_date: 2016-04-15 13:01:13
Wait, so you are so afraid of getting accused of money laundering your plan is to start to ACTUALLY do money laundering to avoid that? 
@_date: 2016-04-17 04:21:16
Or better plan: sell a fake tv and take the bitcoins and send nothing. (Your buddy is the escrow and you always rate him very high)

Yeah, but so could his little circle of friends who all 'early adopted' this global currency when it was only available to people he knew in a specific tiny mailing list. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 17:52:05
They are working on getting the lightning network out and generally not working on anything else. lightning needs timelock verify, so they implement that, large signatures harmed lightning so they coded in a discount just for that. Bitcoin is being molded to just be a tool for one specific company's vision of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:11:17
That has nothing to do with halvings. Also no, that is not a simple concept that "early adopters" of a currency somehow get rich. That isn't generally how any currency on earth has ever worked. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:51:46
Is there literally even one business on earth that has actually announced they are going to accept lightning network coins? 
Has even bitpay or coinbase announced they will even give that as an option? 
@_date: 2016-04-05 01:28:25
How do you figure? If someone wrote you a check for a 3 billion dollars you could buy a billion dollars of hamburgers with it. If someone gave you 3 billion dollars "worth of" bitcoin you couldn't buy 100 million dollars of hamburgers/land/car/real goods. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:12:27
There is like 40 "crypto enthusiasts" in the entire world. That is not a thing many people are. Lots of people though want an economy where you buy a kind of money that just magically makes you richer later. (even if such a thing is nonsense as a concept)

Do you think bitcoin invented QR codes or something? 
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:54:18
A lot of people just want bitcoin to be the one weird trick bankers hate to get rich quick. Any money spent on crypto that isn't make them personally wealthy is seen as bad and needs to be stopped.

If it was a legitimate business someone would be running a regular money version
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:12:44
People that think the "halving" will make the price go up 10x absolutely think they found a way to get rich quick. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 15:50:05
I guess it's important to know what this person thinks and if this is a person he convinced to see the glory and light of satoshi's gift and made a true believer in this currency of the future or if he just misrepresented what bitcoin is and roped someone into a scam they don't understand. 
(and I know some libertarian will be around soon to tell me if she got scammed it's her own fault for not doing research, but in that case then we should blame the OP for not using dogecoin or something and scamming her better in this shitty libertarian nightmare world where scams are virtuous)

People have been planning to pump the bitcoin price on 4/20 for a long time after the price got stuck at 420, it's not really up that much and there is no volume behind it and people have openly said this was a thing they were planning to do. It's not really a rocket ride as much as a poor attempt at making you think it might be. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:52:10
I am PREEEETY sure iceland right now doesn't want money that is "protected" from 'banksters"(?) and "governmentsters", that is literally the thing they are throwing a prime minister out for, using money that was outside government oversight. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 15:25:53
Bitcoin is only free to send if you already have Bitcoin and all the person wants is Bitcoin. Sending money you can use takes money.
@_date: 2016-04-05 01:15:29
Nah, it's just clunky and a poor solution that won't be adopted by any store or anything so it will just do the thing where it keeps pretending it hasn't come out once it's come out. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:27:31
How does that promote bitcoin? He could just shut down all the above ground bitcoin exchanges and outside a really really dumb and unlikely fantasy of neckbeards that would be the end of that for bitcoin having any sort of adoption of any type. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:52:43
And with bitcoin you get no promise from anyone to ever honor or redeem your bitcoin ever for anything and just have some weird hope and faith that maybe it might be. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 12:45:36
Who told you miners work altruistically for what is best for bitcoin as a whole? 
@_date: 2016-04-10 00:13:40
So is this basically your euphemistic way to move away from being a full reserve bank to just buying bitcoin on demand? 
@_date: 2016-04-11 02:06:12
Why not sell the electricity you steal directly?
@_date: 2016-04-26 12:35:14
I don't think it makes it look better to say that 94% of bitcoin volume isn't even real. Bitcoin sounds awful dead in that case. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:16:02
"earning" is a really weird word there. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:56:38
"revolt" in this case means "turn off their bitcoin wallet and call it dumb when it turns out it's not the one weird trick bankers hate to get rich quick like they thought", not rage into the streets or whatever. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 11:53:05
It's a system where lightning network developers have access to push bitcoin code and are writing themselves discounts so their product pays different fees than everyone else since someone did the math and found lightning needs giant signatures and then suddenly the most important thing in bitcoin development was to make signatures cost less. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:33:58

@_date: 2016-04-06 12:55:18
Bitcoin users would be hugely effects since it'd be just as easy to shut down all the bitcoin exchanges as any other remittance companies and bitcoin only exists without exchanges in some dumb fantasy land that will never happen. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 19:44:34
It won't. It will go into various betas and people will see it's not actually that useful or good so it will just continually be in more and more different types of beta never actually launching. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:35:36
what is your best case here? I don't speak english as a first language and you are gonna call me some racist slur or something? 
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:26:57
your bitcoin will be exactly half as secure but maybe people will cheer it on some dumb premise that the money spent on security will now go into your pocket or something somehow by magic.

To the user? zero dollars and often something like negative 1%, have you ever used a credit card?

@_date: 2016-04-18 18:29:15
someone in a bitcoin forum that can't define if they are scamming someone or not? A shock!
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:15:30
In a few months they are going to pay the miners half as much and somehow that is supposed to make you rich, because "I'll pay less for security and infrastructure then pocket the money that would have been spent on that" has a long history of being a good idea. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:30:19
Two competing lies!
Does the halving make you rich quick or does it make the price stable?
Does the price being stable make you rich quick or does it make the price stable? 
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:50:58
Okay, so why even involve bitcoin in this? If coinbase is just being used as a paypal thing and the blockchain is never involved in the transaction? 
@_date: 2016-04-17 13:17:29
It's funny that economics turned out to be so simple and yet no country every thought of this before:
Just half the rate you print money and then everyone will have twice as much money! poverty solved! Or maybe the greedy banksters knew and just didn't want it to happen!~
@_date: 2016-04-09 20:57:19
even changetip barely has any connection to bitcoin anymore. most 'bitcoin' companies left months ago
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:36:34
The difference is that I will pay them more if they return it to me instead. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 20:12:47
Can you answer the question? Is there even one company on earth that plans to deal with lightning networks? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 12:31:30
Yeah, but what if the advantage doesn't fit in the narrow band of hyper specific libertarian anarcho-capitalist ideological views that constrain bitcoin? 99% of the world subscribes to economic theories that are totally incompatible with bitcoin, a more popular coin could easily fit into that and be totally incompatible with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:46:36
yeah you are right, this is going to be a real hit to the price. A permanent reduction in security. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 13:59:04
With 1-2 million users after 7 entire years it hasn't managed to attract much of anyone, so no, not really. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:24:50
Yeah but the heart of the prediction was that bitcoin would fail when everyone else was predicting bitcoin would double or triple and then the mt gox crash happened and his prediction was still very wrong but not so far off that it was a super great source of humor anymore that a guy said bitcoin would crash then it did crash but not as much as he said. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:32:14
I'll give anyone who returns the coins to me instead 21 bitcoin for your help. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 18:15:54
What does this have to do with bitcoin? I thought bitcoin LOVED tax avoidance and this seems like bad news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-07 02:36:20

@_date: 2016-04-13 19:33:08

@_date: 2016-04-03 22:16:24
Okay, but using libertarian/bitcoin economic logic why should any of this be illegal? I thought avoiding taxes and using money outside the reach of any government and stuff was a GOOD thing in bitcoin land? 
is it only a good thing when it's good for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:34:25
You basically tell them paypal is better for that but in a way where for some reason you call them stupid and tell them to read the whitepaper or some other garbage like that if you judge by this thread. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:52:56
and if your bitcoin "goes bust" who decides who gets the remaining assets?
@_date: 2016-04-20 14:30:38
The bitcoin network has less processing power than a pocket calculator. All the hashes aren't computation, they are just sha hashes over and over, the bitcoin network would struggle to add 2+2 or do anything but guess random sha hashes and see if they are lower than a certain number. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:07:38
Most jobs will not pay in bitcoin, even "get a job" requires him getting a very hyperspecific job that pays specifically in bitcoin, just getting a regular job then buying bitcoin with regular people money is a different thing. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:02:30
The statement was "Currently, the bitcoin network is seeing an increased amount of traffic and transactions related to a network stress test. " and we can clearly see there is no increase in 'transactions' so you lied to try to cover another lie

@_date: 2016-04-09 23:31:53
If you are being your own bank then you can't exactly talk about monitoring all your network traffic like it's going too far, it would be lower than  a bare minimum. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:03:29
Does that mean anything in actual concrete terms? Has any company agreed to actually accept lightning network?
Actually for that matter has coinbase even partnered with anyone in the last 18 months to even accept bitcoin? Do they even do that anymore? 
@_date: 2016-04-08 12:52:57
It's not like bitcoin where one guy printed himself 1 million coins then left! 
@_date: 2016-04-10 20:01:09
You shouldn't really keep bitcoin anywhere if the writing on the wall is getting this strong that even companies that were once bitcoin only are fleeing bitcoin for USD. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 12:08:18
or that he is satoshi
@_date: 2016-04-19 14:46:03
The part where you are implying you didn't mean a general stress test on bitcoin but just one on blockchain.info, where that info is also public and the load on blockchain.info wallets seems to be in a dip not a high. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:53:44
Double spend isn't the only risk. Bitcoin transactions until they are in a block can simply never be mined and later cease to exist. Even with a nonevil buyer. 
The whole thing that is bitcoin is the blockchain. If a transaction isn't in that there is no magic you can do but wait more. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 00:37:58
Bitcoin is only "6 billion dollars" using the most absurd measure. Almost none of that 6 billion actually exists or could be retrieved by anyone. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 10:54:40

I never get being proud at lots of people thinking bitcoin is dead. Why is it held up as some hilarious meme instead of a serious thing that more and more people are saying it as bitcoin struggles to gain adoption and loses more and more merchants?

What happens is a bunch of people with an understanding of economics that stops at the first chapter tells you that everyone gets rich because supply and demand and how losing supply will make everyone wealthy because a currency that people are constantly losing money in is a sure thing to raise demand.

Bitcoin stores every transaction ever made on every user's computer, this requires a giant file. In the future a lot of people want to raise limits so that number can grow even bigger even faster.  
but don't worry, just do what everyone else does: just let someone else handle your bitcoin wallet for you, which is a plan that never ever goes wrong or ends in all your coins getting lost or stolen.

@_date: 2016-03-22 19:13:47
Will not? But it's already happened. half of classic nodes run in amazon/choopa, antpool and discuss fish always add up to 50% no matter how much hashrate shifts in a week a few people control the codebase and major bitcoin forums ban even talking about other devs. Whatever rising up of the bitcoin masses you hope for just isn't happening. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 16:41:31
You are years too late to mine bitcoin. The new thing is instead of making your own bitcoin you just buy them from people that mined them for 4 cents each while they sell them to you for 400 dollars each but explain they totally are gonna be worth 4000 each soon but they are selling them now because they like the look of your face or something. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:43:00

The thinking is that "decentralization" is a thin slogan and not a thing that bitcoin actually promotes and there is no reason to think the whole system won't be run out of one data center eventually since there is no advantage to anyone to not do it that way.

You can also see that many many things released since then have had far far larger impacts on the world far faster.

So are we literally to the point of claiming bitcoin is "too big to fail"?
@_date: 2016-03-28 16:25:10
It's dangerous to use measurements like that because they show bitcoin is not used at all and not been growing so we need to suppress and hide numbers like that or bitcoin might look bad. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:22:30
okay but if you count atms as part of a currency then bitcoin surely isn't the winner there.

@_date: 2016-03-22 18:37:26
Yeah but someone saying it in 2008 would have been right, bitcoin has generally failed to be decentralized in any meaningful way with fake nodes and fake miners just controlled by a small number of people.
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:20:26
That is factually incorrect in an easy to verify way sooooo
@_date: 2016-03-25 15:53:51
Of course it's wrong. deflation is terrible for economies and that is why bitcoin is generally a bad currency. But we all have to play along and pretend some dumb game where we all think deflation is a good thing that will make people more well off.

Decentralization rarely solves an actual practical problem people are actually having. It prevents a hypothetical libertarian problem most people don't have. 
So in the practical sense no harm would be done if one guy ran every node. The same way most people use banks and get along just fine. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:21:10
Yeah, bitcoin can handle 250,000 transactions a day and somehow most days doesn't even use nearly that amount. It's unlikely it ever will grow big enough to. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:40:41
Yeah, except a ton of actually disruptive technologies have come up since bitcoin was invented and gotten 10 or 100x the number of users. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:28:11
People generally only make websites with stats that might make bitcoin look good. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:14:34
Did someone tell you that there was someone that would pay you money if there was "good news" in bitcoin? Why would a system work like that? 
@_date: 2016-03-31 12:39:49
Yeah, except it clearly isn't.  With only 250,000 possible transactions a day and that number rarely ever being reached we can be really reasonably certain that bitcoin isn't even involved in even a tiny fraction of dark market anything.

Yes, you need to pay taxes on any profit you made. Idiots will be in shortly to tell you that obama totally won't know if you do a bunch of tax fraud but coinbase is not exactly going to go to bat for you on this and falsify records just to get you out of paying taxes.

Is there one I am missing that has any sort of major growth? 
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:45:31
So do nodes always reject chains that have more coins than should exist or not? Because that seemed to not reject it even a little bit and it had to be done manually.

If bitcoin economics were right then a period of low/no inflation would be a prosperous age for the USD where everyone got rich off free money.  
@_date: 2016-03-22 13:32:50
I mean, gold 1.0 also doesn't have this issue and actually you can dig up a 5000 year old gold coin that has been sitting the whole time and it works just fine. Having to keep maintenance on some weird program is a problem pretty unique to bitcoin that no other type of money really has issues with. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:51:08
You are late, 75% of bitcoin are already "farmed", now instead of mining them you just buy them from someone else that mined them. Which isn't as cool. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:19:04
No probably not. The bitcoin community is dying so bad people have made webpages just to track the numerous media sources saying so because it's become such a common opinion, but itself has long ago hit it's peak, there is rarely even 500 users active, and has been in decline for a long time, I would say it'll hit 180,000 some years from now and not a lot higher. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:46:29
Only a few hundred thousand people want to own bitcoin at all so far. The number of people want would want it in a hyper specific way like that would be vanishingly small.

his point, like every point on here is "this is actually good news for bitcoin"
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:20:17
According to this the average transaction size is now 600bytes: 
So 480gb could handle 800,000,000 transactions.
Paypal does 10 million transactions on an average day. 
So if bitcoin ever gets to be as big as paypal this will cover less than three months of traffic. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:14:45
non mining nodes didn't even exist in the original idea of bitcoin all 'nodes' referred to either miners or spv nodes. 'validating nodes' is just a weird middleman that fucks up the bitcoin network.

having a market cap of 6 billion doesn't actually mean 6 billion was invested into bitcoin. The market cap is just "all coins ever mined * current spot price", most of that value exists only 'on paper'

If you have little money getting into bitcoin because you heard it's a get rich quick scheme might not be a good idea. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 12:11:15
I could make a cryptocurrency with a trillion units then sell one to my brother for a dollar and then have the biggest market cap. Market caps don't really mean anything, huge amount of bitcoin was bought or created for pennies then never moved again. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:24:10
I mean, paypal is already an off chain solution to the problem of "no one wants to use bitcoin".

@_date: 2016-03-10 15:27:45
Yeah, it's absolutely unthinkable the largest bitcoin exchange could steal money!
@_date: 2016-03-24 18:22:08
Your cool plan to use coinbase to not pay taxes on money you got illegally might not pan out if you actually plan to do it with more than trivial amounts of money. Coinbase is required to follow laws to stay in business and probably won't put their neck on the line just to protect you saving a couple bucks. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:39:56
You might not be aware of this but encryption and private keys and even seeds exist outside of bitcoin.

What hours of the day is the bitcoin bank website up? 
@_date: 2016-03-31 15:56:02
The numbers are extremely small, bitcoin as a currency is carrying less than 25,000 transactions a day that are worth more than a dollar most days, and even hitting that has only been recent. It's not even a drop in the bucket in the illegal economy. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:22:01
So max all the miners in the world could make is 15,000 dollars a day? Once the subsidies go away? I know we plan to double or triple the user cap someday but even that sounds pathetic. Fees are gonna have to rise a ton.
@_date: 2016-03-22 18:03:48
Yeah, bitcoin in general is centralized to a few people, look at the way mining "pools" move in lockstep so the two biggest pools always combine to exactly 50%. None of bitcoin's decentralization is real stuff. It's all shallow and pretend centralized stuff. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:12:01
If your plan is to move to a libertarian anarchy money system you should probably be against investors being responsible for economic damages. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:04:16
yes, and capitalism says deflationary currencies are real bad and that bitcoin is going to fail in a few years but we all have to ignore that to get rich quick by scamming people to think they should buy bitcoin. Get it?

In the currency of the future if you forget your password you simply lose all your money forever. But this is good because people have convinced themselves that lots of people losing money in bitcoin will make them richer since they think you will just buy more bitcoin instead of saying "that was a dumb place to keep my money" 
@_date: 2016-03-25 10:53:02
yeah, that, or else maybe only crazy libertarians have crying fits about the basic concept of taxes. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:13:51
Like, it's solving a largely ideological problem instead of a functional problem. All of bitcoin could run off satoshi's computer and it'd function identically at a mechanical level. But ideologically it would be a different proposition.

It's not a sad thought. It's the thing virtually every bitcoiner is praying for. Satoshi is far more valuable as a weird sainted mystery than he ever would be as an actual dude that was some human scumbag.

Because he doesn't work for the same company as the other people running bitcoin so he needs to get kicked out so one company can continue to write bitcoin code that subsidizes their projects and penalizes other projects.

@_date: 2016-05-05 00:56:57
