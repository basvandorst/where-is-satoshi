From a cursory glance of other user experiences I'd say it is legit.  Their customer service hours are 09:00-24:00 GMT, you sent the coins at 22:09, you didn't indicate when you sent the email.
I'd give them time to open up and see if they respond during their customer service hours.
It appears it's an automated process for purchases, so my only guess is you perhaps sent the wrong amount of coins and the system didn't trigger sending the code.

You should be able to import your private keys to a different wallet and just send the transaction again with a higher fee.  That should result in a double spend.  Since it was all your coins you don't have to worry about making sure it's the same inputs.  Obviously this means the recipient will get less total because more is going to fees, but since you didn't get change it's likely the only way to jump the line.

The last I did the numbers, assuming every single mining computer was powered by AMD, and those cards were purchased exclusively for mining, normalizing for 5770 speeds, it would have been under 2% of their total sales by volume.
Call the network 10,000 GHash/sec just to make it easy (it's more like 8500 now).  Assume a 5770 pushes 200MHash/sec (212 or so, but whatever).
10,000/.200 = 50,000 total AMD cards assuming an average of a 5770.  Just to put that in perspective...  Nintendo bought more AMD GPUs than every miner in the world total did in 2011.  They also sold 35,000,000 DX11 GPUs in 2010.  Miners represent a ridiculously small percentage of GPU sales.

If you are in the United States the easiest way is to fund an Mt. Gox account with Bitinstant.  It allows you to deposit cash directly at certain banks.  For example, there is a Chase bank down the street from me where I can take cash and deposit it.  I think it takes about 5 - 15 minutes total for it to appear in your account and they charge something like a 5% processing fee.
Here is a nice step by step walkthrough for that process.

Um... Unfortunately I'm not psychic.  If I had to guess, I'd say you're too late to cash in on the early ASIC rush, all the pre-ordered units will get online well before you get one.  The time to recoup your costs would be so great it may not be worth it.  This though is entirely dependant if you think the price of bitcoin will go up, go down, or remain the same.  I personally feel we'll have a nice ride up for the next 1.5 to 2 years, then something better will come along and everybody will eventually move along.
That's just my opinion though.  If I were psychic I would have shorted some Zynga stock a few months ago and walked out a rich man.

Thank god there aren't any 38 character rainbow tables containing lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.
Just checked.. Mine was salted
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:37:16
Ok.. Not good.  The salts are listed right there in the database.  Your salt is listed right after the $1$
To test this out, if you have a webserver running php 5 or above, make this in to a .php file and substitute your salt and password
    &lt;?php
    $pass = crypt('password', '$1$salt$');
    echo $pass;
    ?&gt;
This will echo back the md5 hash of your password+salt and it will match that in the database.  If you know the hash, and you know the salt, and you have the computing power (bitcoin miner), you can crack any 8 or less character password in a couple days max.

Your power inefficiency is at the wall, not from the unit.  A 1000W PSU will deliver up to 1000W of power to your computer, but will pull 1200W from the wall.
A quality PSU will operate at 80% load for 10years before giving out.  The power efficiency curve you speak of lower down generally is a difference of 2% from 50% and 80% load.
At the cost of electricity, it makes sense to buy the cheapest, quality built, PSU that won't put you over 80% load and not anything higher.
The most important part of a PSU is the number and amperage of 12V rails.  A 4x rail 12A per rail 750W PSU is garbage they slap a $69 price tag on.  A good single rail 60A Seasonic/Corsair/other quality brand is the only way to go.

Well, if your password field starts with $1 it's salted....
But the fucking salt is right there in the database.  $1$salt$
It's php_crypt.  Just tested with my listed salt and password, comes out as listed hash.
So a dictionary + brute force using the salts as given will probably hit 40-60% of these within a few days.
If your password was &lt; 10 digits, or a dictionary word, you can be certain it's been cracked or will be shortly

They made the bios non-writable thanks to a set bit on one of the eeproms (or something like that).
When you try to follow the procedure you get "Bios cannot be erased" even after executing the command to unlock it.  There is no evidence of the shaders traces being cut from the board AFAIK.
My idea to get around this is an old school tophat style flasher.  A physical device you place over the old chip to intercept commands and send back expected values.  That way it wouldn't tell the computer "Hey I can't be written to".  
I'd be interested to know if a BIOS chip from a modded 6950 could be popped on to an unmoddable 6950 and have it function correctly.  It should be trivially easy to get a batch of blank chips, program them, and swap them in.  Cost might be a prohibiting factor though.

Solution looking for a problem.  Cash would be easier and just as discrete in this situation.
@_date: 2011-12-19 02:03:44
Sure, I'll throw 5BTC on there and play for a bit.  Hopefully I can remember not to blow it all before I withdraw.
Well, that's a good first sign... "Problem with server"
Edit; Worked good 2nd time.  Just waiting on a deposit confirmation... My client is a bit outdated and not up to date on block chain.  I'll edit again after I'm done.
Edit 2:  Need 6 confirmations before withdraw which is normal.  I hope this is not a scam, but I have a big feeling it is... I'm actually winning.
Edit 3: Put in my request for withdraw (11 BTC Yay I won!)... I'm waaaay behind on the blockchain though (151366) so we'll see in a few hours if this was a scam or not.
Edit 4: Well, I gave up on waiting, so I downloaded the nightly blockchain, and did a -rescan.
And holy shit.. I actually got the amount I requested to withdraw!
I know this isn't exactly proof, but here is the screenshot of my wallet and the website.
**Edit 5:** If you get a bonus round on any of the multi-reel slots (Iron Man 2, etc) you need to hit escape to exit out of the game after confirming, then start it back up.. then the free spins happen.  I have no idea how I figured that out, but I'm glad I did

These are so far in from the side of the unit, plus you need to reach over the dpad and face buttons to use them.  
I feel a better layout would be more like the GPD XD where they are moved to the upper left and right of the dpad and face buttons.  The speakers would obviously need to be relocated to a more centralized location causing less stereo separation, but come on... you aren't getting true stereo separation regardless.
And yes, I realize nubs are awful, but I feel that putting them in a better position would be immensely helpful in usability.

Oh boy, my comment looks retarded now.
I didn't really understand salting, but it makes since the salt is stored with the hash.  It would have to be if it was reproducable for authentication.
I will leave my ill informed and panic induced comments up for everybody to laugh at my ignorance.
Some good did come from this though.  I will now be using Keepass, and different secure passwords for every site, not just important ones.

If this was a real bet where I would receive $10,000 on winning I would take it in a heartbeat.  Hell I'd put up 2:1 odds and still be extremely confident in taking this bet.

Nah, just a spammer.  Go through their post history, it's mostly promotional posts for products.
Why is this a picture of text, what is their motivation of posting it.  I'd say it's a setup for when they come back to post about a new service they just discovered that helped them out.

I had $1500 on mtgox when they were at like $2.  I decided I was sick of guessing wrong and the money would be better off back in my savings account.  I could have paid for my house and my car....
No real point to this story.
@_date: 2013-09-25 19:19:05
The point is that strange things happen when it comes to statistics and odds that can appear unlikely.  The only thing certain is that with an infinite number of rolls the win loss rate would be 49.5/50.5

I won't even bring up the 1500BTC or so I mined on my CPU when they were worth peanuts. That HDD was ripped apart for its magnets and the platters turned in to coasters.
Edit: can't even think about it now. I get sick when I do.
Edit 2: anybody want to buy some coasters.  Only $300K... anyone?  /cry

If black comes up 9 times in a row in Vegas they don't demand to inspect the wheel.  Suckers just bet heavily on red under the false impression that it is due to hit

Nobody has free power.  The cost is paid by somebody, and if it's the landlord then it's built in to the rent.  If the usage goes up drastically then they can expect rent to go up to compensate.

I have been extremely depressed lately over the (now) $40k Sega Genesis I bought with bitcoins in 2011.
Not nearly as depressed though as when I sold 50 of them through PayPal for an average of $10 each.... Oh, and half of those orders were disputed and refunded.
Or that time I bought 100million Zimbabwe dollars for a couple grand USD by today's exchange rate.
Oh well, I wasn't a believer and thought it was a fun hobby.  Will be a fun story to tell the grandkids some day.

Losing 6 in a row on 50/50 is 1 in 64.  5 out of 6 is significantly better at 6 in 64.  At least that is what my 3am in my head math says.

Sure, there's huge support at $20, but there was also big support on the previous fall.  It just all vanished almost immediately when the bottom started to fall out.
I was there live for it and tried to catch a falling knife several time... lost some good money.

I read the website.  I see no "hidden" fees, but no mention of a rake.  Rakes aren't hidden, they are part of gambling.  Didn't investigate any further, website doesn't play nice with my phone.
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:36:46
Never heard of them, but surely they take a rake.  It's the same way Vegas makes money when you play against others, like in poker.
@_date: 2013-05-16 07:01:16
No, but it's gambling.  I've watched Red come up 13 times in a row in Vegas.  Shit happens.

They can value them at whatever they want.  If they want to consider them worthless then that's their decision.  Like any currency exchange rate, the market rate is only a guideline.

Yep.  The words "cash" and "dollar" crush both.  OP picked unfair search terms to paint bitcoin interest in a positive light.  I'm not arguing that bitcoin isn't making significant gains, but let's not get delusional.
