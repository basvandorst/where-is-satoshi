Sadly yes

You're still fine they originally said it would be required but it ended up not being mandated at all. Check out my videos to learn how to update though so you can get the latest security patches

I got this at Consensus from the Gemini folks using their SPEDN app :)

Not a stupid question at all! Completely understandable. Since your wallet only acts as a bridge between you and the blockchain, where your balance and transaction history is stored, it should not delete any of that information. However, to be safe, you can make sure your history is saved by simply taking screenshots of those records. Furthermore, since you know your public key/address, you can easily find all your transactions on explorers like etherscan.io that allow you to search the blockchain.

One of the keys was that apps like Coinbase made it easy to get bitcoin, and then as more people began buying in that weren't necessarily early adopters, prices increased. Then the media circus that ensued caused huge buying power to move into the market.

I just confirmed on both my devices - once you log back in to those apps, you will see it repopulate :)

Right! Theoretically yes. There are definitely roadblocks for this technology to fully replace common forms of internet &amp; connectivity for these purposes, BUT it has potential to be a solution for localized bitcoin transactions or crypto transactions.

Even if you are still uncomfortable with the risk level to buy more, please, please, please do NOT panic sell. The worst thing you can do in any investment is sell out at a low just because you're scared. That's one sure fire way to lose money.

One good rule of thumb is to be wary of everything asking you for any information whatsoever, keep your head on a swivel for scammers

Agreed - it’s gonna be a while. But now is the time to start thinking about how to move ourselves into the right direction in preparation for quantum. Especially in decentralized environments where it takes time to build and plan a fork, it’s a conversation worth having.

Thanks for your comment! agreed on the keysize front - it's not enough nor is it a sustainable approach.
Interesting on the XMSS in QRL - I'll read up on that.
