I'm curious why would you need to prove how much you bought you coin for? You can't sell them at the price you bought them, they'll always be worth what the market says they're worth.
Coinbase pro keeps a record in your order history. This is where you can see a list of how much btc you bought and at what cost.
If you want to sell, transfer the coin back to your address at the exchange and you can sell them there.

Can't compete with the bots, that didn't occur to me. Will be holding my keys from now on.

This is a very good point. It's not any foreseeable market crashes that would make me panic sell. I hodl'd through some scary low points, but never lose faith the market will always bounce back.
It's the unforseen, like a crack in the tech that might appear. I know how unlikely this is with the best minds constantly trying to find a crack and failing over and over.
Think I'm being a neurotic tbh.

This is exactly what I needed to hear. I knew this about the exchanges but I was stupidly ignoring it. You're spot on.
I've been thinking about what you said. I realised if the highly unlikely scenarios I'm creating in my mind were to happen, there's also the chance the exchange would put a hold on trading anyway.
I'm pulling it out, thank you.

Nothing like that, just been DCA, putting in a bit of my paycheck every month and it is starting to be enough that I'm fearing unlikely scenarios. 
I have as much cash saved as I have put into BTC. Would never borrow to buy it. I'm in with my eyes open and try to view it like a gamble.

I'm worrying about the 0.001% someone finds a chink in the armor of the tech itself. Reading these comments here have made me realise I am running very unlikely scenarios in my mind.
If the market crashes I think it will always bounce back as long as the tech is sound.
