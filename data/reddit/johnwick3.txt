ELI5: What happens to my current coins if the chain forks? Hard fork / Soft fork differences? Can't I just HODL?
Long, long time lurker for reddit here... first post, actually... I literally made an account to post this...
Anyways... so I have some bitcoin and I'm worried about what's going to happen if BU activates and the chain/community splits.
Technically speaking I've done a lot of reading about bitcoin but I still don't understand what happens to my current coins if the chain forks... I have read dozens of posts here and I still don't understand the difference between a hard fork or a soft fork, either...
**My most important question: Can't I just HODL indefinitely and my coins will be on both chains as the result of a fork, thus once one fails, my coins are still around on the good chain?**

I'm not going to "cash it out".  I'm going to HODL until the Morpheus/Neo meme comes true...
Point being, I'm never going to convert it back to fiat.  I am going to continue to hodl it until it goes to zero or it becomes part of everyday life for a large sect if not all of the planet... and at that point I will just simply start using it... not cashing it out.

Is it finally going to lock in after it locked in during the last lock in?  Motherfucking locked in!   LAWCKED INNNNNN!!11!!'

I uninstalled the price checking app that I was using for the crypto market and now I DO NOT check the price... I am just going to HODL.
Hate to meme but it's true.  My anxiety surrounding the price has completely vanished since I uninstalled the app and stopped seeking out the price.

After Segwit locks in, how much longer until it locks in, and then will it be able to lock in sometime after it locks in again?

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:29:01
Does this mean the lock in is finally going to lock in once it locks in after it locks in?  Is this the real and final lock in or is this lock in one of the grandfather lock ins?

No idea on his character based on anything other than reading in this sub... don't know the man... really no idea.
That being said, always be weary of those that seek power.  There are good ones for sure but the extreme vast majority are selfish assholes.

Satoshi’s identity is obvious if you spend just one day digging for as much info as possible... there’s no definitive smoking gun, but if it walks like a duck, etc...
Two... 0% chance HE didn’t see that Bitcoin was eventually going to catch on.  It’s still got a long way to go in terms of adoption and it is going to get there.  Hal Finney broke down the probable eventual value of 1 BTC in relation to USD almost immediately upon BTC’s release, so it’s pretty obvious that Satoshi saw the same thing, especially given that he hasn’t sold his stash.

Nice start... longer version needs to include riots in the street from currencies collapsing and some future headlines about Bitcoin surging and changing humanity... 
I am obsessed with Bitcoin and while I'm not a Taylor fan, 1989 was a fantastic album but her two newest songs don't impress from the new album... if "Look what you made me do" is the lead song and thus potentially biggest hit, it's going to flop and her career probably already peaked.

This is all you need to know.

Do you not understand that most of this isn’t about block size?
It’s about a few guys that are more interested in lining their pockets right now and potentially in the future by taking control of code changes.
It’s about taking control away from the most technical savvy people in the room that are all auditing each other and giving it to people one step this side of Jamie Dimon.
If the miners and big companies can make changes to the code and hijack the name Bitcoin, it’s already dead.  It will be no more useful than a “coin” released by a government and or a large corporation.
The entire purpose of Bitcoin is giving control to USERS of their own money while maintaining DECENTRALIZATION.
If you can’t see the difference between the probable motivations of a bunch of developers in comparison to the probable motivations of a bunch of guys that are already unimaginably wealthy, that is your own personal problem.

If that's not a sign of a bubble idk what is lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:38:50
Yeah, an idiotic blowhard who inherited a shit ton of money that doesn't really give a fuck about Bitcoin as anything other than a channel for gambling who's bragging on social media about buying a ton of Bitcoin as the price is already skyrocketing ISN'T a sign of a bubble.  You're right.  *rolls eyes*

These are quite old along with the OP... by the same guy(s)... my two favorites...

Does it really look like he was using crypto because he was into crypto?  That's really how this situation strikes you?  Interesting.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:00:24
It needs to replace gold and it needs to replace fiat money, so both.  Long term, if it does not do both, there is no reason for it.  And long term, if it does not do both, it will bust.
Scaling must be solved but decentralization is one of the if not the most important aspect to Bitcoin.  It can't be allowed to scale with the cost being centralization.
We are still in major speculation territory.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:58:29
It means he isn't Satoshi... you don't even need to analyze literally ANYTHING else.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:48:08
He can't even pronounce "Satoshi" properly.  Fuck this guy and his diseased brain.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:46:33
The "oh" is very distinct and it's definitely not "AWH"... lol
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:31:57
You're wrong.

Depends on what Coinbase decides...
But you don't have any dedicated BTC on coinbase that will automatically be on both chains in the event of a split because your BTC balance on coinbase isn't BTC... it's just a promise to give you BTC...
If you send them coins to a wallet address on your coinbase account, the receiving address immediately spends the coins... thus when the website reflects that you have let's say 1.25 BTC... you don't have 1.25 BTC... that's a promise by coinbase to give you 1.25 BTC if you request it... in other words... insecure af
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:51:36
Hahahahaha... anyone else notice that this guy can't even properly pronounce Satoshi?
He pronounces it Sah Taw She... rofl...
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:54:30
In 15 years 1 BTC will either be worth 0 or 1 BTC will be so unimaginably high that if you just held onto 1 you'd probably be set for life.  I don't see an in between.
What's the likelihood of which direction happening?  Who knows?
Of course none of this could matter due to WW3, a solar flare taking out all electronics, a worldwide economic collapse that had much further reaching implications than unemployment skyrocketing.. lol... God only knows.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:59:30
Fuck... idk man... maybe to learn how to pronounce the name of the identity you are claiming to be?  Lol...
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:52:53
You're wrong.

Understood about the activating regardless.  My point being... if all of the miners are going to remain status quo or try to enforce Segwit2x, what are 10% of nodes really going to be able to do if no exchanges or miners follow?
The developers.  That's the big question, no?  I think the smart people will follow the developers, such as yourself... but I'm curious where most of the devs stand.  None of this matters as I understand Bitcoin has no central head but as far as I'm concerned, I'd be following competent devs if I stayed with Bitcoin at all.
