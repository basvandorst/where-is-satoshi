To be fair its an emerging tech. Did you know people used to shit on and refuse fiat cash for years instead wanting to keep their shiny gold?.. this is history in the making mate. I dont expect it to be a smooth ride but the destination remains unchanged.

Do you think Bcashers arent in it for the short term gain.. them "flippening" post make their intentions fairly clear.. btc is risking its short term wealth for long term prosperity.. bch is risling their long term sustainability for short term growth..

I think the term "chinese knockoff" remains true. It may be that some factories produce the original and the duplicate but you can be dam sure the original is held to a strict standard and the knockoff cuts production corners to maximise cost/profit

At the start of this year my uncle got me started on my bitcoin adventure. It has proven quite exciting. The ups, the Downs. It's all fun. And just last week I sold 4 of my BTC and was able to purchase to pc. For awhile there I didn't believe btc would actually translate into something I could buy things with. (I did exchange the 4btc to Aud and purchased with Aud but it was still btc that made the value.

I cant say I really looked, most people here in Aus use this site. It's reputation is great and with my pc I don't really care to take a risk on quality :/. Haha yeh AUD is peanuts to some other currencies. But. All will be peanuts to btc eventually hehe

As I mentioned above, I'm a bit nowhere with this stuff. Want to tell me why it's no good?

If everyone is just going to hodl and not start treating btc as everyday spending money how can you expect it to replace fiat.
