It does solve a problem. There’s no central bank to manipulate the supply. 
He doesn’t bring that up because he doesn’t think it’s an issue, he just brushes over it with “there’s a lot of libertarian ideology” to which the host chuckles to... not sure what was funny about that, considering some of the smartest minds in history have been libertarian, but sure. 
The currency system exists because people like him think they are geniuses. Bitcoin solves the problem of having to depend on them to actually be right, and “bail out” their buddies when they aren’t right and mark it down as a learning lesson. Except they never learn. 
The Federal Reserve act brought the Fed to life and it was immediately followed by the largest boom in this nation’s history followed by the largest bust in this nation’s history... coincidence? I think not. 
Competition isn’t a bad thing. If central banks are so great, then bitcoin shouldn’t even be a factor. But they aren’t so people seek out the options the benefit them better. Bitcoin isn’t “digital money” or an “electronic payment platform”. It’s an entire fucking monetary policy based on mathematical proofs and trustless, permissionless, and open access. It’s Windows vs Linux.

Again, you are trying to debate the merits of socialism, based off the debunked economic thought of Marx et all. 
If you want to argue for socialism, you need to do it under the context of valid economic axioms. But you just shed away because “billionaires” control that language. You are no better than a religious zealot trying to prove evolution wrong by using the Bible.

Soooo, explain how that doesn’t turn into exactly what we have now... do you agree with the premise that some people are better at trade than others? So how do we not end up in a situation where the people who are better at trade don’t work their way to the top again if there’s such a thing as private property? This is the point. Property *literally cannot exist for a socialist society to exist”. Fuck what some morons postulated on paper. This is demonstrably proven with tons of evidence to back it up *in real life*.


Yes, under capitalism. Because capitalism is the individual ownership and control of your capital. So if you want to own part of a business, you do so. 


No, economic theory is built upon axioms and assumptions. In order to have level ground to discuss on, we need firm definitions of things. 


Well you are right that it won’t matter. This is like arguing Game of Thrones plotlines. Such a scenario (an entire socialist society) is wholly implausible, and proved over and over and over again. As you said, co-opt companies exist within the framework of capitalism... so what’s the problem here?


“Violent”? Get the fuck out of here. Last time I checked, there aren’t armed guards at the doors of my work. There will however, be men with guns who show up if I don’t pay forced taxes to fund your socialist polices. Fuck you for having the audacity to think capitalism is “violent” when socialism is directly responsible for the death and suffering of quite literally 10s if not 100s of millions throughout history. 




And this has never happened and could never happen under socialism right? Lol this is pathetic. Keep drinking that koolade 


I’m sorry, did someone put a gun to your head to buy a shirt? Capitalism is the voluntary interaction in trade. Why aren’t you demanding the shirt maker provide you that information? Why don’t you start a shirt manufacturer that provides such information and cut down the competitors if that’s clearly what the market wants. Last time I checked, it’s illegal to import goods made with Slave labor anyways. 


Sounds like a great business opportunity for you. Good luck!


Demand it. Or don’t trade your money. I don’t understand what’s so hard for you to understand about that. You realize when you walk past a store you don’t have to buy something, correct?
Your entire system depends on the altruism and good faith of people, which I’m sorry to say, doesn’t exist. Get over it sunshine. Welcome to reality. Again, you won’t be using my money to fund your society based on flowers, unicorns, and rainbows. Bitcoin ensures that.

I’m sorry, but you should have learned in grade school that Wikipedia is not a valid source, for the very reason you just demonstrated. Just because people who can write are able to edit a Wikipedia article to sound articulate and make it sound official doesn’t change the definition. Grab any economic textbook from the past century, it’s pretty clearly defined. It’s a smokeshow of confusion that socialists try and use to make the definition “hard to nail down” so that they can never actually be proven wrong. In reality, definitions are axioms in which all your theory is built. You can’t have a theory without firmly defined axioms and assumptions. 


Hmmm, my MBA begs to differ but sure. 


Again, flowery language that means nothing. This is bullshit. Please source such wildly ridiculous claims that something like “ownership” is dependent upon some fleeting “property system”. Ownership is a very simple concept that even primates understand. 
Sorry you don’t understand basic economics?


I would agree with that statement. So go ahead, explain to me how you abolish private property (thus stripping me of my bitcoin) without access to my private keys. Case and point... you can’t. You never can. Bitcoin is literally the antithesis if socialism. It’s the trump card to your no opt out system. 


Absolutely nothing. Because there’s no ownership of anything. So no only do you own bitcoin, even if in some weird way you did, what would you buy? There’s nothing to buy? You own everything as being part of the collective, but you individually control nothing because you share ownership with everyone. Again, shows the stupidity of such a system. 


Holy shit dude. Personal property doesn’t exist in socialism. It can’t. Because the second that it does, there creates a market of those who want what you have, and things they are willing to do to trade for them. Thus, we are back at capitalism. Congrats!


This sentence makes no sense. How can you buy a lake, receive noting in return, and then the lake still be owned by everyone? Why are you buying a lake?


What is your point?


Lol, can’t take you seriously if you don’t agree that tragedy of the commons is a fundamental axiom of all modern economics. Sorry, a blog post doesn’t constitute a research paper, and the paper pointed to very particular circumstances to which tragedy of the commons doesn’t exist. Are you really going to tell me there aren’t endangered species right now? Really? That’s demonstrably retarded. 


No, I’m literally stuck with the actual definition as defined by any economics book. Not some internet pseudo economics. Meanwhile, you write wholly pointless sentences with flowery language that mean literally 0, and tell me that I’m incoherent. Again, we agree to disagree, but I still have accredited qualifications that I can lean on. You keep leaning on Wikipedia though. 


No, I’m referring to things that happen ***in the real world, in the real economy*** not some fairy tale fantasy. 


�� 
Tell me, how do productivity losses factor into your fairytale economy? As is very easily demonstrated, not everyone works 100% at all times. So what happens when say, Jim bob just doesn’t feel like working one day? Or even more so, only gives 50% effort.  Does he share in the produce of everyone else? He’s a worker isn’t he? He owns just as much as you do in terms of share of the profits. How does Sally look at such a situation? Jim bob doing half the work making just as much?
Also, you fail to describe how one can both “own” personal objects yet not own them in a way that can be used to make a profit (thus be right back to capitalism). If I own a house, do I have to house any travelers? What if someone wants to give me a new car for a nights stay, can I trade? If not, if I’m traveling am I allowed to just crash at anyone’s house, because it’s all public property remember.
You can use all the flowery bullshit you want, call yourself a farmer (��������������) and pretend like you are superior for believing in some scarcely believed fairytale, but just remember that the reason is dirty capitalists are out ahead of you isn’t due to privilege, it’s just a simple as understanding how the world works and not trying to fight reality with a system that has demonstrably failed over and over and over again.
In the end, results matter. Take a look at the results of all your efforts and then compare. If they aren’t where you want them (you’re advocating for fucking socialism, so I know they aren’t) it’s no one’s fault but your own.

There’s going to be two fallout effects if/when, some sort of fraud is realized within tether....
The substantiated effect, which would likely be minimal due to the market cap of tether only being &lt;.5% of all of crypto market cap, however it will be present. The exchange for tethers did artificially (if we are assuming there’s fraud for sake of example) pump up the price, and there will be a correction as that is realized. 
Then there will also be the “overreaction” which always follows any type of move good or bad. This is the investor panic that no amount of “calming” or presenting truthful data will alleviate it. This could potentially spook a massive sell off that could “pop the bubble” that many people suspect we are in and return us to 2016 prices. Self fulfilling prophecies have their place in investing spheres. If enough people believe something is going to happen, it will probably happen in some form.

No, this is just word fuckery used to dance around the actual issues by socialists. Socialism is very clearly defined in all economic realms as the social ownership of the factors of production. And this is the direct antithesis of the private ownership of the factors of production, or what is known as capitalism. It has nothing to do with who makes the rules, it is entirely defined by the simple principal of ownership. And with ownership comes the feature of control. Hence why individuals can control capital in capitalism, but not socialism. There isn’t such thing as ownership in socialism. The concept doesn’t exist. 


Exactly, ie the individual makes all decisions of how/if that capital is spent... sounds like bitcoin. Unless you found a way to spend without a private key. 


Not in socialism. Socialism literally does away with the concept of ownership. You literally can’t own anything in socialism. Everything is owned by everyone and thus everyone has an equal decision how it is allocated/used. Sorry, but hobo joe is a fucking idiot and shouldn’t have the same sway as a Harvard business grad. 


You’re just spitting words. You have no claim here. Again, in socialism there’s no concept of ownership because everything is property of the collective. That’s a terrible idea for reasons that should be obvious if you’ve ever talked to a homeless person. 


I agree. Also, good luck with this. It’s been tried many times and failed every time. 


No, again, property doesn’t exist in socialism. The concept doesn’t exist. It’s like 2+2=banana. It’s nonsense in the context of socialism. Sorry, but I can provide for myself far better than some bureaucrat ever could. And bitcoin makes it possible for me to divorce myself from your system. Good luck taxing me ��  


What? So literally, tragedy of the commons is what you are proposing?


This is just dumb. You want your cake and want to eat it too. First off, you can already do this in a capitalist system. There’s literally nothing stopping you. Really, all this word play is just a bunch of bullshit to say “I want someone else to front the financial risk, and I want to “own” things when it’s making money. But if it isn’t, and it’s losing, I never had anything at risk to begin with so who cares.” This is quite possibly the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, and speaks to the fact you probably have 0 experience ever running a company. 


Again, completely contradicting yourself. You want to “own” a house when it’s convenient, but not when it’s inconvenient. Make up your mind. You either have property (capitalism) or you don’t (socialism). 


You have explained absolutely nothing. 


Exactly. So why is it that you feel entitled to the fruits of your labor any more than your agreed upon employment?
When you need to take out a personal loan in order to meet payroll like I did in 2007, then come talk to me about “social ownership” and how you deserve a portion of the profits. Until then, sit down, shut up, fulfill the agreement between us as an employee and collect your paycheck.
Bottom line is, bitcoin literally makes socialism impossible. It is literally the individual ownership and control of capital, which you have 0 ability to abolish.  Or tax through inflation or income tax. Bitcoin is the beginning of the end of all that is socialism. Go ahead, look at pretty much all of the founders of this project and their reasoning for doing so, and their political affiliation.  Nick Szabo, arguably part of the original group that was Satoshi would be a good place to start. 
Have fun trying to fight it though. It’s amusing for the rest of us.

I know exactly what socialism is, *in the context of actual, intellectual economic discussion.* ie, what anyone with any academic level of economics recognizes socialism as. Outside of crackpot theories that are proved wrong. You are quite literally asking me to believe in the teachings of Marx first, so that I can then prove him wrong. That’s called circular logic, and it’s never appropriate in any rational discussion.


Yes, I rationally can argue what it is. Go find out what the definition of rational is. *You* are quite literally the one who is being irrational here. 


Well if “peaceist” had an actual valid definition within the realm of modern day politics, then that definition should be used. More aptly, to continue your definition, you are like someone from ISIS trying to convince me that because you don’t see killing people as terrorism, you are a “holy warrior” and not a “terrorist”. But any rational person, who partakes in reality can obviously see that you are full of shit.

Neither situation is preferable. 
When the price drops because volume drops, it means that price is only driven up by new money.  Who in their right mind looks at the chart at this point and says “yep this looks like a good time to ‘invest’”. 
However, on days like June 17th when the CBOE contracts expired, volume was peaking during the sell offs. Which means there was a rush to the exit. 
Really, you want smooth volume, and low volatility in general. We have the exact opposite. Froth 101.

The bcash movement seems much larger than it really is on social media, yet literally anywhere you turn people don’t take it seriously. 
Only people who for whatever reason see on chain bitcoin as the way it was supposed to be, and completely understand and accept all of the potential they give up and limitations they take on with such a model (few and far between but there are some respectable ones that fully understand and accept it for what it is), and then those who are severely under informed actually care about bcash.

You seem to aliken investing to gambling which couldn’t be further from the truth. 
In reality, investing is looking at a situation, knowing your roundabout odds of being right vs wrong, and when compared to your potential losses, you come up positive over time. 
For example, if I have a strategy that only works 50% of the time, it may seem like gambling, but if the potential upside is always 3x the potential downside, (through the use of a stop loss), then I will come out successful over time.
That’s not at all what’s happening here. Instead of limiting loss potential and claiming profits when available, people are expanding their potential loss on the same likelihood of outcome. 
That’s a pretty terrible investment strategy.

This all boils down to the point I’ve been saying all along. Socialism is a bunch of flowery words for a failed theory. Not to mention, if you strip the economic definition from it like you chose to, you can already achieve what you want in a capitalist society. Google “employee owned companies”. There’s quite a few.

What a dumb statement. So I guess capitalism is a socially owned economic system because we all take part individually in our own capacity? Just because people are cooperating doesn’t make it “socialistic”. Publicly traded companies are conglomerates of people that are cooperating in a revenue generating scheme, but that doesn’t make them socialist entities. 
More retarded wordplay of socialists trying to tongue twist their way out of losing an argument. Just because you can string some words together that sound fancy, doesn’t mean they hold any logical weight.

Lol, who’s redefining terms now? Nothing I have said is vague. That’s a fundamental economic axiom of pretty much all economic theory. If you choose to reject modern economic thought, then I can’t help you see the light. But that doesn’t make you right. 


What the fuck are you talking about. I control my own thoughts. My thoughts are constructed from a substantial amount of feedback loops and critical analysis of what I have observed to take place around me. Fuck you and your smug attitude that because you read some laughably inept economic thought experiments, you are now “enlightened” and everyone else around you is void of such knowledge and corrupt. Results matter. And the results are that you are still broke and socialism is still yet to come to fruition and always fails in any attempt. 
Capitalism isn’t some human structure. In its purest form, it is literally the absence of any rules in economics. It’s the natural order that simply spawns when there’s a difference in values and the willingness to allocate scarce resources. 


No, that’s some crack pot theory, by a dip shit by the name of Carl Marx, which has been proven wrong through actual practice. Just because you choose not to accept it doesn’t make you right. 


False. I own land. I own a house. I own a car. I own equity in cash generating entities. If you have a 401k, you do to (although as an “anticaptialist” is not holding my breath that you own anything more than a bong). I own other resources that I can use to produce value. 


I’m no billionaire yet, and I own land. Once agin, demonstrably wrong. 


Do you not have the right to own cash? Can you not use that cash to buy a lawnmower? Congrats, you can start a lawn cutting business. Welcome to capitalism. Get out there champ. 


This statement is stupid and makes no sense. There’s land out in West Texas for a dollar an acre. Get at em buddy. 


Again, your crackpot theories that are demonstrably wrong have no place in valid economic discussion. Socialism has failed over and over again, so you don’t get to claim your definitions as true nor superior. In fact, they are by definition false and inferior. 


Who is oppressing the employees in literally an employee owned company? 


Wtf are you taking about. What is “muggerism”?




Which can’t work. Because someone needs to assume losses. If you don’t front anything, why should you be rewarded. It’s easy to claim stake on something when you have nothing to lose. 


Again, you use the word violent, yet socialism (or at least the movement towards it) is documented to be the direct cause of hundreds of millions of deaths in less than a few centuries. 


No shit. Because I’m arguing with someone whether unicorns have feathers or not. Socialism is literally a joke and anyone who fully invests their time and effort into “learning the deep folds” of it is a verifiable fucking idiot. 






No, ***you*** missed the point. I understand your point. You think Nike is mean for using child labor and it’s unethical yada yada but you still fail to address the point that Nike wouldn’t make a dime if that really mattered to people. Case and point. An economy based off altruism doesn’t work.


Because there’s nothing to debate. Your axioms are literally based in proven fallacy. 


Lol, coming from the guy who literally believes Marx is valid economic thought in 2018...


My nephew wants $1M. Is he just going to get it? No because that’s not how reality works.

Not only is this blatantly wrong and completely contrary to the very definition of socialism, it’s completely stupid as well. 
You want someone to front up the factors of production but not have a say in how they are utilized? There’s a reason the day 1 fry preparer at McDonald’s doesn’t have the same sway as the CEO and it has nothing to do with unfairness or greed. 
If you are talking about everyone fronting the cost, and splitting the profits, you don’t need socialism to do that. There’s already plenty of employee owned companies. In fact, you and your buddies can start up a company tomorrow, all front the same amount of capital, and all divy the power and profits as you see fit. 
Tell me, why is it that socialists love sharing profits, but never sharing losses? When the business you work for is losing money, does your boss come by and collect money from you that day? Or do you take home a paycheck just the same for the work you did?

I’m not interested in “historic socialists”, I’m interested in how fucking stupid the idea of socialism is in modern day, hence we use modern day economic axioms to debunk it. You are in denial of that. 
You still never even addressed:
-How do we not devolve into a system of coercion when you yourself even admit that markets would form if private property exists
-How one deals with productivity losses of everyone is entitled to a fair share due simply to their existing and thus ownership
-Why capitalism must go away for employee owned companies to exist (when they literally exist today)
-you claim capitalism is violent with absolutely no statistics to back that up. However, with 2 minutes of googling it’s quite simple to see literally 10s of millions of murders that are a direct result of communist/socialist movements
-why Nike makes any money if they don’t expose their use of child labor yet, everyone is acutely aware of it
-Just about any other claim I have put out there on the realistic practice of socialism (and thus the complete debunking of the drunken ramblings of a loser from the 19th century)

Sounds like your point is that any interest against you is bad which is my original point. 2% a year is not good for savings... so it will take 40 years for ethereum to even decrease to 2%... meaning it’s much much higher right now. Not doing well for your argument. 
Also, we keep hearing this “ethereum isn’t decided in this or that direction yet” argument... and that’s ok how? You want something that could completely change tomorrow? Fundamentals like its release rate? It’s consensus mechanism? Are you joking? And people ask what makes bitcoin better.

No, I’m literally referring to the universally accepted definition of socialism as:
“The societal ownership of the factors of production”
And since we’ve already established that markets would form with the the ability to own private property, we can logically deduce from that, that there will be good traders and bad traders. And individuals who will capitalize on their own personal property (cars turn into taxis, houses turn into hotels, lawnmowers turn into landscaping businesses). So the only way to not devolve back into capitalism and inequality (because dipshits like you wouldn’t magically get better with money by just redistributing it... source the thousands of lotto winners who go broke shortly after) the *would be the abolition of private property as well.*
It doesn’t matter what the drunkard Marx says. He was an idiot and literally the father of all modern totalitarian regimes today. So, sorry, you claiming his word as truth is an isis person saying their view of Islam is truth.
The rest of the world sees socialism in the context of reality. That’s how learning and critical thinking is done. It’s a feedback loop of testing your hypotheses. Marx had some batshit hypotheses that were demonstrably proved wrong. So we adapted modern economic thought. Well, those of us who understand economics did. Meanwhile, you and your smug buddies think you are geniuses for holding tight to already proved wrong information. You are the economic equivalent of a flat earther. Congrats.

Well first you should probably go back and read [what I said](
"But if you look at the potential economic situations that you could incur if we did away with your democratic voice (which you are actively voicing support for by not voting)"
So you not voting is effectively voicing that you not wanting the ability to vote. Just because you can get away with the marginal increase of economic feasibility by you *not* voting doesn't mean that everyone has the same luxury. If everyone was to make the same decision as you, the democratic voice slips away, and your *implied voice* by just being lazy is no longer heard.

@_date: 2017-03-26 21:00:53
What are you talking about? Clearly it is *you* who needs to read up on bitcoin. Segwit moves transactions off the network and is an effective block size increase. I'm not talking about implementing BU, that would be disastrous. An effective 2MB block is not going to "dilute security and increase centralization".
The solution to a scaling problem is not "do nothing" when solutions like Segwit and LN are available.
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:49:17
Right, I'm on the same page that too big of blocks is extremely detrimental. I'm not a big blocker at all.
But to say that "2MB OMG we're doomed forever, we are killing the project, and we are effectively halving everything about bitcoin" is just unfounded and false.
The 1MB limit was put there for spam attacks, temporarily. That doesn't mean that we can't later change our mind and decide that we actually want to keep it at 1MB because it seems to work in our favor. We can absolutely do that. But it also doesn't mean that anything greater than 1MB is just too doom the rest of the chain, which the guy I was replying to seems is going to happen.
I agree that off chain scaling is the solution, but right now, that's not going to happen without some sort of compromise. This guy effectively wants to make blocks *smaller* because with Segwit you are reducing the size of transactions in blocks, which is what makes it an *effective* block size increase, not a hard block size increase.
This guy is just trolling and or has crazy out there ideas that just aren't founded in reality.

Sure if you can time the market, that's obviously the best thing to do. But most people can't.
Holding on a market that has extreme upside potential is the easiest way to make money, and ensures you don't lose any of that upside because you sold and it took off before it went back up again. I sold half of what I had at 400 last year, thinking that had to be the top. Wish I would have just held on. Now I just buy a little bit any time it starts to drop off significantly.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:10:44
The point is that you are essentially stealing from the public by not voting.
Everyone's voice is required to reach a democratic majority. Sure you may save time (and thus money) by not voting, but not everyone can do that.
So what makes you so special that you are allowed to? Everyone else puts in the time to vote, why are you somehow more deserving of your time than everyone else?
Another way to look at it... If you copy a song from a friend without paying the artist... Are you stealing?
Technically it is a copy of the work, and thus doesn't cost the artist any resources for you to get that marginal extra copy of the song. And sure the artist probably won't feel that marginal decrease in participation for paying for his/her material. But not everyone has that luxury. If they did, the artist wouldn't make any money.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:52:55
From a purely, simplistic, economical standpoint, yes, it is economically irrational to vote.
But if you look at the potential economic situations that you could incur if we did away with your democratic voice (which you are actively voicing support for by not voting), you are most likely at a severe economic disadvantage by not voting. Blockchains are an extremely inefficient way of settling transactions, but we do it for the economic benefit of not allowing for a single authority to have the ability to cheat, it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:22:32
Because side chains means LN, and LN means open blocks, and open blocks means low fees again. Look what happened to OPEC when the US filled the market with cheap oil from the oil sands in the midwest. They don't want that to happen to them.
Its understandable, but it really is a pain in the ass for everyone else.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:39:46
Anyone who is out of the space for a while, and comes back to the price crashing or high fees and wait times will do some light research and find all the propaganda from BU and it sounds obvious. It happened to me, and I would bet that's why we continually get clued out responses like that.
Like most things, the block size debate is a complicated one. BU is trying to make it sound simple on the surface, and without looking into the details, its pretty much impossible to realize it is a sham front for a hostile takeover.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:13:55
We flooded the oil markets that OPEC had an oligopoly over for the last few decades, and all of the sudden the price of oil dropped. The price of oil had been held artificially high for a while because the few oil producing countries were able to meet yearly, decide how much each country would produce (so not to produce too much), and everyone who produced oil would win, and we felt that with $3/4 per gallon gas prices.
In 2014 when we started extracting oil from our oil sands in the midwest, we flooded the market, and the price of oil started to drop. This put countries like Venezuela into a tailspin, because most of their economy is based off of oil exports. They started to produce more to make up for lost money, and other countries did the same, and next thing you know, supply is 2x what it was, and demand hasn't changed. Price plummeted to about $30 a barrel briefly and has only recovered to just over $50 per barrel today (from it's previous $100). 
You can thank the mid west for your $2 gas prices today.
The major miners are worried about this exact same situation (Jihan Wu has already expressed it previously, I don't have a link the to post but you can find it fairly easily). If transactions move to off chain, he loses out on much of the transaction costs that he needs to pay his bills for his mining operation. Right now, they are loving the high fee's and they know that BU isn't going to ever pass, so they are just using it to keep the fees high. Make no mistake, Jihan has no intentions of forking. He's not stupid.

Segwit literally *IS* a block size increase in a quadratic form. It's not "throwing a bone to all whining socialists".
["Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB)."](
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:10:02
I'm not advocating for BU. Blocks larger than 2MB would be disastrous, at least right now.
But 2MB is not unfeasible, nor does it centralize at all. That's like complaining that running the calculator app on a modern day computer is slowing it down. Or that downloading a single picture off online is going to make you reach your data cap limit. 2MB blocks on modern day computers is a minuscule change, and as computer infrastructure grows in the future, feasible block sizes will grow as well.
CD's used to have 700MB on them. Now a Blu Ray disk, the exact same physical size, can handle 50GB. We're essentially talking about going from CD size to DVD size in the age of Blu Ray.
I'm not advocating for unlimited blocks. But to *decrease the blocks*  which is what Segwit with 1MB is (it's naturally 2MB), would just be fucking stupid. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:02:39

Miners can only process as many transactions as can fit in a block (faster transactions) and thus the competition that causes increases individual transaction rates to increase is eliminated (lowering the transaction costs) hence the block size debate... Pretty much everyone agrees that in order to maintain feasibility, the blocks need to increase in size. People just don't agree how to do that.
["with 100% of transactions using segwit features this is expected to be about 2MB of data per block"](
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:03:06
Had a discussion with him earlier. Went through his comment history, and his position is essentially, don't scale, and effectively decrease block size, and the solution is to just make it so prohibitively expensive that people choose not to use it (market equilibrium).
That would be a good if we were asking for some drastic change, but its a 2 MB *effective* block size....

Well its not entirely certain that the alt coin rise is directly related to the bitcoin growth problem, at least not 1:1.
I for one have bought quite a lot of ether for the simple fact that there's a substantial market for what ethereum is going after. Bitcoin is a value store and transfer protocol. It does that very well. There's no other alt coin that does it better in fact. Just because money is leaving the bitcoin space doesn't mean it is doing so just because of transfer problems. Its entirely likely, that people are just spreading capital to other parts of the market ready to see substantial growth in their own way, and when bitcoin breaks through this issue, they will add additional capital back into bitcoin, most likely from the outside (fiat) world in.
Plus, Segwit + LN, which would pretty much make micro payments on the block chain a thing of the past. There's no real reason to push for more than a 2MB limit if we haven't hit it yet.
If we do, there's quite a few core developers who have already voiced for larger blocks in the past, so this idea that core is hard lined against larger blocks is simply false.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:58:52
