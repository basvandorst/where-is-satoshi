All of this. Definitely.

Have quantum computers broken into burned wallets already? And if so, what did that do to the market price? What of quantum cryptography? I need answers, man. All it takes is a million fucking qubits. 10 years time according to IBM.

But really though, this guy has no idea what he's talking about. In unregulated crypto, who the F knows what will happen! But I like the words.

You have to change the view to get a more accurate picture. It matches up pretty close on the "3m" view. (Mempool, bottom chart)

CME is opening up Bitcoin futures allowing investors easy access to purchase "Bitcoin" without worrying about the complexities of the process.
This is a pretty damn big deal. You can go here for more info:

In order to run a full node, you need to open up port 8333 (tcp/udp) in your firewall and point it to the computer running the wallet. Make sure to open up the same port in your computer's firewall as well (again, tcp &amp; udp). I'd also recommend changing the settings in your wallet to run at boot, and minimize on close. I just started one up myself!

I'm trying to figure out how to celebrate and release my excitement without any Bitcoin'y friends... I know, I'll start up a full node! Core FTW!

It's not correct however to say that the merchant "checks the network if there is sufficient funds" when it comes to crypto-currencies. That would still be true if there were third party payment systems within the Bitcoin ecosystem, but a beautiful aspect of Bitcoin is that the network IS the payment system, as well as the bank. If I want to buy something, it is the holder sending the funds, not a third party doing it on your behalf. So on the most fundamental level you cannot spend money you don't have, therefore there is no need to "check if there is sufficient funds"

That's great news! A step in the right direction, however exchange fees are still WAY too high. According to the mempool stats ( you can successfully send transactions at 1-5 sat/Byte right now which is pennies on the dollar. Before anyone assumes exchanges are going out of their way here, consider that it wouldn't be very difficult to create a function that can read the mempool stats in realtime and dynamically adjust the withdrawal fee, if not real-time, at least on a 24 hour cycle. But no one is doing it, because a lot of money is being made. Either way, fee's can and should be much lower than they are now.

Quantum Computers will one day break into wallets that are lost. Bitcoin can grow and change algorithms as quantum cryptography is perfected, but will eventually require wallet-holders to move the funds to a more secure address as "older" encryption breaks down.
Burned/lost wallets will not be able to do this and will be susceptible to quantum computing finding the private keys. I think this will happen a lot faster than most people realize. IBM states  roughly 10 years to create enough qubits to get to this point (millions), but I'd wager more between 10-20 years. But my bet is that it WILL happen.

"Competitor" -- riiiiiight. More like a disruptive technology, no stopping it.

Alrighty then.
