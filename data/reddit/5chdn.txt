Curious! I just came here to figure out the same!
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:42:04
Figured it out:
- New wallet: jaxx_import
- Select: Standard Wallet
- Select: I already have a seed
- Enter your seed from Jaxx Backup
- Click Options, and check: BIP39 Seed (should read "Checksum: ok")
- Don't change the path
- Set a password and encrypt the wallet file
- Confirm, and wait for transactions and balance to load

Not understanding what you are trying to suggest.  You can not sync BTC and BCH blocks at the same time, therefore we created flags to allow users full control over the client and synchronization behavior.

That's just marketing speech, the real news is that `bptc` is now ready to support BTC w/ SegWit.

Confirmed, he also spammed this link on another subreddit I moderate.

Scammer, do not click!

Parity Bitcoin does not plan to use libbitcoin-consensus.
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:08:59
Done, thanks.

Bitcrust is no full node implementation, it currently only implements the database layer. But we are open for collaboration, sure.
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:29:00
It does not commit to any previously discussed scaling approach and neither favors segwit nor increased blocksize. It's a neutral release and pull requests are always welcome.
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:20:08
I'm working for Parity. Ask me anything.
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:44:52
Feel free to submit a pull request to propose the switch. :)
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:40:57
Nevertheless, commitment to one or another is a political decision and we consider parity-bitcoin as neutral release. Anyone is free to add SegWit. Pull requests are welcome.

Could you clarify what you want to know?

A clean, reliable and performant bitcoin client. I can't comment on Mozilla's projects though :)

Wait, it's not okay to talk about sending _some_ amount of Bitcoin on a sub-reddit dedicated to ... Bitcoin?

This number only applies for archive nodes. Parity discards intermediate states as they are not of any use for 95% of the users.
A fresh sync'ed Parity client requires 10 GB.

+1 p2pool is probably the most important mining pool software available.

Depending on which version you are running, you have pruning enabled already.
Give it a go, reset your blockchain, and sync from scratch, this will take only a couple of hours and you will only require 20GB disk space.

ping u/busterroni ^
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:21:19
^ This. 
A full Ethereum node requires around 10-20 GB as of today based on which client you chose.

What do you mean by password protected? Isn't the mnemonic seed the plain access to your funds?
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:39:18
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:17:45
Yes I'm suspecting this too.

And how do you register it? In Germany you have to provide your passport ID during online registration for prepaid cards. Isn't Sweden doing the same?
