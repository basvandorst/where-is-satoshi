Oh, you'll need a connection all right, it's just that catching it with a packet sniffer is hard if it's a miner and next to impossible if it's a wallet stealer.

Funnily enough that was more or less the 21 Inc. business plan

You don't know what stocks are, do you?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:34:26
With your vast "crypto tech" expertise, could you explain how does a packet sniffer help against a malware miner or crypto stealer?
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:01:33
Or they can just use Visa.
(They will use Visa.)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:30:04
What's the point then???
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:33:06


Except for the miners.

Lol, asking for bribes on reddit before giving an "expert" statement before the parliament. Never change, bitcoiners.

According to the Japanese law it's not your BTC. If you don't like that you shouldn't have traded on a Japanese exchange.

You've completely misunderstood how LN works, yet post confidently about its technical details. Good work.

This is what bitcoiners really think! They brigade every survey and then are eternally surprised when it turns out that no real merchant is interested in bitcoin.

How, exactly will this work and how is it different from how Bitpay works right now?

Smart people use Latin, it gives your arguments extra authority.

Calling a commodity that can lose 70% of its value in a few months a good store of value is a bad joke. "On paper" is meaningless, only real outcomes matter.

The concept of the invisible hand is an idea arising in classical economics in the late 1700s. Since then it has been found quite naive and simplistic, and is usually overlooked for a good reason.

Are you an autist? I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:03:50
It won't because the merchants will still need to convert bitcoins to actual money and the LN doesn't help at all there.
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:22:50


The answer is an unequivocal yes, it'll be a comedy goldmine.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:24:07
It will never become mainstream because it is a bad currency and a bad payment system.
@_date: 2018-03-05 11:15:07
Yes but we're supposed to pretend it doesn't, or that the wasted energy magically produces something worth the cost, because otherwise bitcoin would look like a monstrously inefficient ecological disaster and we can't have that.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:34:18
How about it's not true? Only a small number of people can make lots of money in a pyramid scheme, the rest are lying.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:18:55
Too bad it's nothing compared to the value bitcoin is destroying, i.e. the electricity and other resources burned by the miners. It's not even a zero-sum game, it's a negative-sum game.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:56:03
I think we'll just require all the nodes to log user IPs so the illegal transactions can be traced back to the users, like with all other payment networks. If the node operator disagrees, just throw him in jail.

Why? You gambling addicts keep buying their shit anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:25:24
Bitcoin is a negative-sum game so a large part of the community will always be hurting so that the few lucky ones could afford lambos.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:22:01
The dollars do serve as a resource allocation mechanism that brings quite a bit of added value. Bitcoin doesn't, though, because it's slower and more expensive than its competitors.

Also any other crypto can implement their own LN. Technically a bank could implement a LN for dollar tokens if they wanted.

They're not too stupid OP, most of them are actually too smart to touch bitcoin with a 10-foot pole.

Well, yes. In this case we assume it's just bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:11:25
Bit-Coin is decentralised precisely for this reason, so that authoritarians like you can't tell other people how to spell bitCoin.

That's harsh. I think the bitcoin fundamentals might justify a valuation of up to $100/BTC right now, though it'll go down as the DNM dealers move to coins with better secrecy.

How, exactly? So far we've seen only the exact opposite happen with bitcoin, real money going from the pockets of the many to the pockets of the few.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:03:27
Yes it is. And if you're going to go through all the trouble of creating verified accounts in several exchanges you could as well use TransferWise or something similar, get a superior UX and not touch bitcoins at all.

If you don't sell your fiat money for bitcoins you haven't lost anything. 1 USD = 1 USD. You need to have strong hands and just HODL your actualmoney.
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:33:31
How could this be irrelevant? Are you basing your worldview entirely on ideology and faith, ignoring evidence altogether?
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:25:57

It's a naive and oversimplifying conclusion based on assumptions which usually do not hold.

In the meantime bitcoin has crashed 10%
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:25:23


If the current empirical evidence shows that we are moving into the wrong direction, that bitcoin is increasing inequality instead of lowering it, why do you still think it's a good idea? How do you arrive at the conclusion that eventually it'll make a U-turn and everything will turn out great?

You don't get to make up your own definitions for words. Forex trading isn't investing any more than going to a casino is.

Blockchain data is public, you can run the same calculation yourself if you don't trust them.


Exchange addresses are known and can be ignored.


Nodes, users, mining and exchanges don't matter any more than they do in the current system, only wealth ownership does, which is perfectly captures in the Gini.


There you go again. *Why* do you believe this, if the data at hand points to the exact opposite conclusion?
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:45:52
Wow crazy, now where have I seen this kind of sentiment before?
