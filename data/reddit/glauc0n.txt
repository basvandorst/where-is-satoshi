It should go towards the appalachia area.

Feinstein. lol, of course.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:31:11
that's the thing. I use segwit and I don't understand what people keep bitching about. Fees are hardly anything and transactions go quickly.

GreenAddress? Samourai? What about a ledger wallet or a trezor?

Not to mention as things like opendime sticks become more popular people won't have to use the blockchain at all.

I have a gemini account already, but do they have an app like coinbase? If not, they should develop one immediately. They need to make things as simple as possible for noobs.

A Netanyahu endorsement is bad for bitcoin.

This is going to be a freaking nightmare for me. I have literally hundreds and hundreds of trades. I've been in crypto since mid 2016, but I've made so many trades I don't know whether I will qualify for short or long term capital gains.

Can't you get banned from the app though? What about transaction fees if Bitcoin starts going insane again?

- Affirmative action discriminates AGAINST WHITES
- Government quotas are enacted AGAINST WHITES.
- All of hollywood is anti-white
- The majority of the mainstream media is anti white
- The entire institutional structure of the united states is geared towards demographically displacing the white population (now down to 58% vs 90% in 1965).
- And you want to sit here and tell me there is a "racist system" against non whites??

So if I bought a ledger wallet with some bitcoins that may have appreciated 100-200% I will owe tax on that ~70 dollars of bitoin?

When are they going to implement lightning network?

SO MUCH THIS. These people are liars and are trying to deceive people into buying their product. They even just released their own "bitcoin wallet" on bitcoin.com. It is fraud what they are doing. It is brand theft. 
These people are pieces of shit and they know what they are doing.

lol reddit. He's one of the only politicians in the country worth a shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:56:28
That's politically incorrect talk. And if you weren't so anti white you'd see there may be some truth to that statement.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:42:45
if that were the case BCH should be dumped and litecoin used instead.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:57:16
why. Because he says things that aren't politically correct? Is he a mean old waycistttt???
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:30:52
BUT WHY. WHY IS IT GOING UP SO MUCH
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:37:12
but is this mt gox guy going to continue to unload his bitcoin? The whole situation is very confusing.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:29:21
They are shutting down all exchanges in china.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:43:12
yea but how do you know all these people were going to hang onto their bitcoins for 3 years? Also, I got in bitcoin in summer of '16, was it just standard operating procedure to leave money on exchanges before Mt. Gox? Do these people who left money on exchanges have any responsibility in losing their money. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:24:01
But why would people use Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin? What is the advantage to using Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:56:58
Really? Fees seem virtually non existent for Bitcoin on Segwit. When I transferred 40k from legacy chain to segwit chain the fee was like a few bucks.
Average waiting time for confirmation I think is around 30 minutes. What is the average waiting time for transfers of bch? And will it stay low if more people adopt it?
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:23:43
Bitcoin to monero. But you still have to convert back to bitcoin if you want to sell for fiat, right? Unless there is somewhere you can convert monero to fiat. 
Unless monero completely anonymizes you, and when you convert back to bitcoin, IRS has no idea whose bitcoins those now belong to.

20 fucking percent tax on my gains is a fucking joke. holy shit.
