Be sure to review this dipshit's book on Amazon:
1.0 out of 5 stars
December 9, 2017
Format: Hardcover
Checked out from the library, got about 1/2 way throught and then realized this guy doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground."
Sounds accurate.
"1.0 out of 5 stars
ByKocka Slavomiron October 21, 2013
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
The book contains few ideas, worth thinking about, but in general, after 100 pages, I only got information, that agile architecture is in fact SOA architecture, and that they in ZapThink knew everything, and how great they are... :( I forced me to read approximately 1/3 of the book, but, I found no value. Just introduction to introduction to introduction..."

Usually you're just over the top, but with this post you've arrived at being an outright fool.

Interesting that with that attitude you are frequenting a Bitcoin subreddit.
Jason? Is that you?

Unfortunately, very true.
CS at exchanges is abysmal and always has been.

"I would imagine you would enter in these new lots as income...".
That's a lot of the problem. They are not income. The BTC income was selling 0.10 BTC when it was worth more than when I purchased, netting a $200 gain on the sale as described above.
Now when I bring back the bet amount because I won the bet, plus my profit, I need to adjust the Cost Basis of my pool of BTC (by averaging - doing FIFO/LIFO etc. would be even more work - unless I can get software to do it for me). 
But the 0.10 I'm getting back is not income, plus the 0.50 (which is sportsbetting profit and thus earned income, not Capital Gain/Loss crypto income) are not crypto profit and thus not to be figured as income.

Coinbase had an option to appeal the judge's ruling but declined.

"Coinbase is not powerful enough to start trying to contest judges and the IRS."
They did contest the initial request which was for all info from all customers, and succeeded.
They could've contested the revised request, but they don't care about their customers - they cared about putting on a front of pretending to care about their customers privacy.
"...especially with robin hood on the rise."
This occurred before Robin Hood had announced their plans and has nothing to do with Robin Hood.

In any one of the tax years from 2013 to 2015 if one had over 20k aggregate in transactions in any one of these categories: Buy; Sell; Deposit; Withdraw.

Coinbase had a legal right to contest, the government would have had no cause to "come down hard on them", they had been successful once already.
Obviously cleaning up Coinbase's reputation means more to you than reality.
Do you get paid by the post? 50 cents? Reputation.com?

Yes, I meant Bitcoin.tax and not Bitcointaxes.
So far neither I nor anyone else has figured out how to use it.
Here's an example:
1) I bet 0.10 BTC which I bought when 1.0 BTC = $10,000 USD, and when I make the bet 1.0 BTC is worth $12,00 USD. So I've purchased a bet for 0.10 BTC.
2) Disregarding whether the bet itself makes a profit or not, which is regular income and not relevant to my Capital Gain/Loss in cryptos for the year - I have made a $200 profit on my sale of the 0.10 BTC to purchase the bet.
3) Now I win this bet. I get back my 0.10 BTC plus I've won 0.50 BTC.
4) I've already accounted for the increase in value of the 0.10 BTC on my sale of that 0.10 BTC (i.e., 0.10 BTC when I purchased was worth $1,000 and when I made the bet it is worth $1200). See 
But now I have to account for adding the 0.10 BTC that was bet as well as the 0.50 BTC win amount into my pool of BTC, both of these at a current Cost Basis of 1.0 BTC = $12,000, which changes the Cost Basis per BTC of my pool of BTC.
I can tediously do this manually, calculating Cost Basis by Averaging, but I'm wondering if there is some way these softwares can help.

It is not inaccurate.
After the IRS came back with the 20k in transactions figure which reduced it to 13k customers and the judge agreed to this, the judge stated that Coinbase has the right to appeal that ruling.
And Coinbase did not.
