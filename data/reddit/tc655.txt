We need to be able to verify that the firmware running on the device is indeed compiled from the source code published publicly.

The ones who bought early have dolphinately had a lot for awhale. Otter people, not so much.

No no, not at all. We use mod math because it is easy to do forwards, but hard to do backwards. It provides a one-way function:

G is the base point of the elliptic curve. It is the point of reference in the curve parameters. You can see [here]( that it is exactly equal to

in compressed form, for secp256k1. Here is a good video on Elliptic Curves:

Were you also using TeamViewer's 2fa?

Here's an album of screenshots of me running the virus:
It appears to be written in a scripting language called AutoIt. It puts a vbs script in the start up folder which runs another vbs script in a hidden folder. That then runs a batch file which runs the obpopHIO.exe which I assume is the interpreter for the AutoIt script file, zjbbcgXDK.
I can only guess that it tries to upload your wallet file or something.

No. Given a certain (RMS) voltage, AC is far more dangerous than DC. You can grab 120 VDC with both hands and be fine, but if you were to grab 120 VAC with both hands you could be seriously hurt.

So 1 bitcoin = 1000000 coinbit

Thanks for the 100 uBTC. ;)

Run the keygens in a [Sandbox]( or a virtual machine.

What we really need to do is get [Wolfram|Alpha]( to support bitcoins. It's a computational knowledge engine that would be able to list its value on each exchange, average them, graph them, compare them, project them, [or find the minimum cost in bitcoins to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool with milk from Indianapolis](
