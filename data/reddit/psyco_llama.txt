I know this whole thing has a dark cloud vibe, but I'm actually glad the government is recognizing crypto currency as legitimate money. I'm even happier that the OP has been a responsible citizen with his finances (hopefully!), further adding to the value of the movement. Kudos OP

So what ive gathered from this, is that someone crafted the perfect DoS against Mt. Gox due to the way that they verify transactions? Since Mt. Gox ignored the well known 'bug' (used loosely here) it was exploited in a sense...

Thanks. Im just asking for someone that shares the same vision and point me in the right direction to help me get this made and ready to launch. Its a super fun game and feel that it will do well. I would also like to use blockchain transactions for use in my random number generator, which will appease people who want the technology be used for something useful, rather than 'just another betting game'.

This is certainly possible. Bitcoin itself is decentralized by using peer to peer exchange via elliptical curve cryptography. Why not create Bitcoin 2.0 and have exchange rates built into the technology? This would decentralize market exchange and with asic chips on the horizon, it would make good use if the hashing power of the network that is to come?

Sure, of course thats what THEY say, but the evidence and major news channels such as BBC say otherwise. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:47:43
I think the only problem with bitcoin, is its ties to fiat currency. If anything has ties to say the us dollar, there will be corruption and manipulation. I call it the 'Presidential Election Effect'....
Take $/BTC conversion out of bitcoin, and let it stand on its own. But I think this is true with any currency, not just btc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:48:30
I mean sure, if someone has 100k to put into bitcoin, I wouldn't have any need to care about the price of coin either. Nor the twelve cars I own either....

No not really. The only post is from January and its from the seller. He states that he sold 300 units last year, and everything else in his post is the same as the aliexpress ad. But I suppose thats why escrow is in order.

Haha,, love the Kramer reference. Yea, I told him not to stop, that if he really believes he can do it, then go for it. But Im not waiting around to see what happens.

I've been doing the same thing. I've been watching since 27$, and seeing this happen, I'm glad I took some advise and waited. My accounts will be set up by the time the price drops from the excitement happening. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:00:27
We are shooting for 0%, that's the goal anyway. Only cost would be for the app itself. That way it saves everyone money. Pay one small fee, that's it. But we are still working the angles. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:24:39
For the time being, we are being hush hush. Nondisclosures are being signed within our team and investors. We will release more info when we have something working. Everything is still theoretical and is in development.

Is it a bubble when someone purposely manipulates the market by ddos'ing a major exchange? I think not. As yourself what would the possibility of it hitting $300 by end of April if these jackasses hadnt intervened..... I am holding.

@_date: 2013-03-23 00:29:20
Yea, I know that, but trying to get him to understand that is a whole different task. Granted, he is not dumb by any means. He is a professional programmer for Dell, and has been doing this for a long time. The method he is going to be using for the CUDA cores is in fact something that has never been done before. And what he wants to do actually makes sense. Im on the fence here. I want to believe him, but common sense says no way. But then again, Im not a programmer......

To break even according to the calculators and some forgiveness for the increasing difficulty, I should have an ROI in about a month. Thats with running 3 of them.
As for ASIC, I only wish I could get my hands on some. (as for everyone else) With all the drama around BFL, I most likely wont buy from them. Avalon's window for getting in on round 3 came and went very quick and couldnt come up with the funds to get in on it. I figured with the slow arrivals of ASICs, I could be making some profit now, rather than taking a ticket and having a seat for an Avalon.

1.An ASIC is a unique type of integrated circuit meant for a specific application while an FPGA is a reprogrammable integrated circuit.
2.An ASIC can no longer be altered once created while an FPGA can.
3.It is common practice to design and test on an FPGA before implementing on an ASIC.
4.An ASIC wastes very little material compared to an FPGA and the recurring costs are low.
5.FPGA is better than an ASIC when building low volume production circuits.

Yes, exactly my thinking! Ill be talking the guy down from 2k, but I was hoping that someone had bought one and could verify the overall quality of it. I was looking for a ZTEX miner, but the one I want isnt for sale on the site. Quad-Spartan 6 LX150 1.15y. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:27:24
Yea, I know, try telling him that.... 
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:33:58
Yea, and the way he explains it, it makes sense how its going to be done. IF, and I emphasize a big IF..... his method would revolutionize the way we mine for coin. Im purposely being vague here, to protect potential company assets. But if this does work, it can be used for a wide variety of applications... including ASIC.

From what I saw, there was a transcript of the conversation some people had with BFL_Josh and they were asking about the possibility to get some working units in customers hands by April 1st in relation to a bitbet. So I take it that it didnt take place.
"Lab_Rat: It hashes????
BFL_Josh: Yes, it hashes
BFL_Josh: I just don't have the firmware here in KC yet.
enkidu99: nice josh. does this mean you're able to get the next batch of wafers inbound as well?
BFL_Josh: I have to check on specifically where they are in the process, I've been primarily focused on the current batch."
o_O  With THIS much spotlight on him, he doesnt even know where they are in the process? hmmm.
Not to mention if you read the transcript, josh was very uncertain about everything he talked about. '

With power costs. But these things run at 85w each, so plugging 4 of them in is still less than most of my other electronics that run all the time, such as my server. lol. Plus, I wont be footing the bill.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:10:55
Worst case scenario is that he creates this, it does improve mining by 15% using the algorithm he is using and we accept btc for donation. Im sure anyone that does mine, would like their rig to run 15% more efficient. 
I on the other hand want to create a new technology that will allow consumers to use their coin in an easy to use way, building off the current infrastructure. Problem is that I cant create it because I dont posses the knowledge on how to. So I need to find people who do....
