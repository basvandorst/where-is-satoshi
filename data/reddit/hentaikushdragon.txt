yep, just bought some more coin because this is my goddamn dream.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:10:02
its still up 54% from last month...
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:54:10
if always spend what you can afford to lose, you’ll never be intimidated! most likely you spend on something dumb every day like a soda with a meal instead of getting water. just don’t buy any drinks for a month or so and there’s $100 in bitcoin instead of soda.
use a wallet to hold your coin, as exchanges own your coin. 
there’s a ton of information if you check the FAQ! i don’t know everything that goes in bitcoin so you’d be better off there :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:14
who are you?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:14:10
only direction i can see is up, buying more is key for your future
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:44:12
ahhh that's really nice:)
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:41:03
day trading without doing a lot of research is a good way to lose money :( i learned the hard way
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:33:11
I thought I did :(
I screamed when I found one today thinking that it was the wallet I was looking to recover.. Turned out to be an empty wallet that I made for whatever reason, hahaha.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:19:49
totally not the same thing.. this is no effort at all, yours was minimal effort.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:47:04
i think you mean SwagWit
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:46:40
well i hope you find what youre looking for at a reasonable price :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:46:16
i'm sure if you were to write out your username i'd see that super stussy s right in front
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:32:17
im not by any means a rich bitcoin man but we can both get there! lets both start investing even more now and we'll join the ranks :)
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:22:50
i'm sad every time i think of it
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:11:46
it's never smart to hold all of your eggs in one basket, but this might be a basket worth investing in.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:48:01
pretty old actually and i don't think i've ever really seen it get this much love. it's usually downvoted into oblivion
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:34:10
I've been blessed time and time again, I do not have any doubt in Satoshi. Bitcoin shall continue to conquer the new lands!
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:25:36
just lost one of mine :( terrible feeling
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:33:21
yep! it sure does go to a wallet:) someone else commented more pics:

i really thought this was r/iamverybadass with some of these comments hahaha! they'll have fun on earth while we're soaring through space 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:52:12
here is definitely the place to chime in as it's a post directly regarding it:)
i come for everything bitcoin related and i get really excited when i see progress. i welcome the memes because it'll keep people here for the drama and excitement 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:40:10
meanwhile my car broke down a few weeks ago and i dont have enough to even put down a payment for another one right now :+) 
e: its not even worth trying to fix
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:39:37
keep on adding to that investment, and HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:48:54
too lazy to do any work for any sort of payment, really

A lot of people know him from BMX and a lot of people know him from music; he hosted Lil Pumps tour "No Jumper Tour" and he's been incredibly popular lately

i was definitely thinking the logo was going to be put on the moon! we're going to take over the moon and start going further!!
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:47:21
that's true, i guess the only thing to recommend is HODLing:)
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:32:16
i want to hop on the free bitcoin train but i'm much too lazy to do something like this
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:18:14
okay, i'm genuinely confused as to what the point of your comment is.. are you not encouraging younger generations to get into Crypto? you want them to be ignorant and not pick up on this?
did you mean to say mature? and if so, it's only people enjoying themselves and having a little bit of fun with what is being presented to them. just move along when you see the posts
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:06:57
youve done the lords work
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:21:40
taxes are a bitch on the BTC ATM’s but worth it if that’s pretty much your only option
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:29:59
i regret not caring about what seemed to be a small amount of coin back in the day. 
the thing is, we can’t just continue to dwell on the past. let’s buy up some of that coin and become those rich people with hundreds of thousands in btc profit
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:53:50
oh trust me it’s been a bitch to hold anything over .1 
any time i see my value go up even like $10 i’m tempted to sell. i completely understand what you’re talking about, but it gets easier once you zoom out ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:12:14
sorta! after 3 or so years i’ve never sold a substantial amount but the anxiety always gets to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:28:45
probably because you commented 13 hours after the post was made
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:58:11
buy $50-75 every week instead of $300 once a month. keep an eye on the dips and try to shoot for them. late night and weekends being the best times to buy. 
at least that's my suggestion 
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:20:51
dabbling in both to spend coin and invest coin
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:52:16
redditor for a day and think people will fall for their troll
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:25:55
im gonna have to guess that we might even hit $6001.50 once we get to $6001
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:35:44
have a set day that you must buy on every week:) and just judge when you'll buy it during that day
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:47:55
do you pay taxes on pretty much everything you buy?
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:34:47
how is it literally impossible to use

i heard her cousin 5000 has a banging body and is coming to town in a few days
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:56:23
there's a setting on the mobile official app to turn it off
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:45:11
some markets do - specific ones are famous for it
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:56:15
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:22:25
could already be verified, or could do Btc atm
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:00:13
okay, excuse me for using the wrong term here - egifter prompted me to send more money to cover the total cost even though I sent plenty. I ended up sending much more than was needed and when I went to email them they just said that's volatility for you and that's too bad. 
What are you talking about with bank cards? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:44:34
wall street has been committing large, ongoing crimes in plain sight for years ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:12:29
i don't think i've seen anyone genuinely say 300k by next year
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:09:25
a market i have in mind is known for having it and is held in a superior light to most markets due to it, so yes, it is used much.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:35:47
sadly i woke up to 2615 so i'm a lil worried! just another reason to hodl
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:40:00
overstock and newegg are my two top choices in spending bitcoin.
