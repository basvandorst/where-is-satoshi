Frick as I'm getting ready to buy price runs up like $30!  Well went ahead and tried to buy at $668 but then the Coinbase new price change screen came up and I hit accept.  $671 plus fees.  Hopefully a wise buy.

Don't think it's a fake sale as I know the buyer Alex Charfen.  He's a hell of a businessman.  Very curious to see what his plans are.

How can someone who is a Bitcoin believer transition from a non related field such as real estate agent to enter the Bitcoin field?  I have some network support experience but no recent technology experience.  How could I come up with a plan?  Thanks for all you do.  You are an asset to the Bitcoin community.

I entered my email and pressed reserve name or whatever the button says and nothing happens.  Anyone else having this issue?  Actually the issue resolved when I switched from IE to Chrome.  But regarding password phrase that was written down...it seems a better chance of losing this passphrase than keeping it online or in email...thoughts?

I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the news release of this transaction.  The one time I clicked on someones What's App post in twitter it seemed very scammy and I told myself never to use that app.  Now facebook spends a fricken fortune to buy it.  Short FB immediately !

I would also send them Coinbase's info too.  That way they will know you are just providing information rather than having them think you are receiving compensation from Bitpay.

Great as always Andreas.  I'm the asking yesterday if you were coming to Miami conference yesterday on Twitter.

If someone has a Coinbase account, and they will soon be selling Ether, is there a reason to have a Jaxx wallet?

What about breadwallet on Android?  Does it support BIP 75 as well?  If so time to look into Copay it looks like. BTW what's with that name?  Copay?  Like a wallet to pay your part of a dr visit that insurance does not cover?
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:10:48
Actually like a reverse stock split.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:55:53
Need an easy way to buy call options on Bitcoin like it was a stock.  Wish coinbase could come up with something but then more kyc/aml rules... Can't make a ton to buy a Bitcoin at 750.  It goes to 1500 and you just double your money.  If there were options and this happened within a few months you could make like hundreds of thousands of fiat!

Whiney rage-quitter was there..... So there's that.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:41:48
It may still be safe but since you are already in a reputable wallet no need to do anything right now.  I would wait at least a few days and do your research before making another move.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:21:02
I like Copay wallet but I migrated to Airbitz as i like their account setup process better.  Look at their article for about 12 word seed security.

Love listening to Trace as Bitcoin soars ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:06:08
If you are on Android go read Breadwallet reviews in Google play and then see if you are still excited about sending your coins to one of their wallets.  I decided on Airbitz due to their security differentiation.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:24:31
If you're on Android I'd do more research on wallets and read those reviews on Google play before sending coins there.

Look at it like a stock individual vs institutional ownership.  I would think much more individual at this point.  By the time institutions own big concentration you'll be talking tens of thousands per coin.

Yes it's scary how many people are considering using this software because it looks pretty.  Just looking at the founders pics on their website scared me away.  That and what you said.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:45:53
Yes you have to move any coins you want to send from long term storage vault to regular wallet.  That takes 2 days.  Then you can send elsewhere.

Unbelievable!!  Way to go Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-19 02:46:28
I thought the whole point of the service was rounding up your purchase to next dollar to buy btc.  I guess they got rid of that because no way to make money.  With that feature find no interest.

A big company like Honda is most likely only going to utilize Bitcoin through a service such as BitPay.  Also very likely is you will find the managers at your location will have no decision making power.  Although they can send the info up the line and if enough dealerships keep asking the same questions/requests then at that point the leadership of Honda USA will then look into it.
