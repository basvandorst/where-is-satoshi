Not a chance, the investment in mining is making this currency a poor choice for everyone. Why waste tens thousands dollars for a few BTC when you could hoard tons of alternative coins of low mining difficulty ?
And unless miserly scrooges stop hoarding BTC, doge may in the near future overtake Bitcoin altogether, both as a reliable investment and spending currency.

mtGox might have planned to profit off sale of coins by witholding the large supply they had from the market.

What I think is he did not create Bitcoin himself but upon instructions from a group or gov agency and he was taken by surprise without a story for reporters, and needed to consult these parties so as to sing the same tune  while keeping them discrete (his response was classic, no comment, he did classified jobs he's not authorized to speak about).
The most surprising is how the agency angle is not being pressed. For all you know, Bitcoin and related are actually a new form of folding meant to power a military computing grid with distributed, infinitely scalable computing power.

Would it be viable for small payments though? I'd rather be offered stock for BTC.

Why even deny if they got it wrong? He just proved he was either Dorian.
And by coincidence, this week? This proves that not only did he not completely leave Bitcoin, but he's following its actuality with interest so great he came to debunk this story right after it was published.

They need every penny to survive, and would love spending it instead.
Blame the fat cats for sucking all the wealth dry and keeping it out of the economy, unspent. How many yachts and cars does one realistically buy ?

Great art. This should really become an official face of BTC, like with doge. It shows more attitude than a bastardized dollar sign.

You can live off singledigit interest without touching the principal, when the capital invested is large enough (especially if you got a job).
Just don't piss away your money trying to live like a fortune500 trader.

He kinda gambled away his share, and even used about 50k of his sister's...

- Never buy when the stock is volatile or expensive.
- Never go all in. Invest only how much you can afford to lose.
- Keep following the stock evolution using automated means taking into account your current losses, so you always buy and sell at a profit and in appropriate enough volumes. Not sure there's software to automate this analysis/counceling but it's common in the stock market trading or homegrown scripts.
But seriously, forget about Bitcoin right now. You're clearly no good at this stuff and need to cut your losses, either by dropping out entirely or only keeping a small volume 'just in case value shoots out the roof again'.

* Buy low
* Sell high
If you bought cheap (300-400$) and held on until today, you'd have recouped back a significant chunk of your losses (bitcoin rose again to 858$ today and is still hovering around 800$).
Still, if you're crazy enough to try bitcoining again, at least only invest what you can afford to lose, dont go 'all in'.

Gambling (misappropriated )funds you were entrusted with may be legally sanctioned depending on your juridiction.
You gambled away your own share. Your sister's safe if you don't squander it too. Given the circumstances, don't expect getting the remaining money split fifty-fifty, though it should be possibly to cut your losses a bit if your sister doesnt feel like letting you live in poverty.
Seriously, there's much better investments to be made with this much cash. You could've purchased houses cheaply and resold them for profit or rented after cost-effective renovations (a friend does it, let's say he's a multimillionaire now after a difficult youth).

Oh god. Both will be homeless next month if the sister (or anyone except thieves) doesn't take control of finances.

Betting on solid future IPOs may be worth a consideration, but keep in mind to hold even if stock tanks, or reduce your commitment if it evolves negatively beyond a reasonable threshold.
For smaller but reliable gains, Samsung stock should be a safe bet, given how steadfast it and the company's finances and global reach keep improving. They planned to give dividends to raise share prices, which may help before you sell (now or down the road).

Get a job for reliable income, or depend on charity from your sister for life.

All these losses and all you care about is **your share** ?
