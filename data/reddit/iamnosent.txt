Have you moved any BTC off the Coinbase platform? Sending your BTC to a hardware wallet counts as a “taxable event.” There is of course debate over this but I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Please do keep us updated!

HODL HARD, STACK BITCOINS. Pick some huge number and resolve to only taking profit when the price of Bitcoin hits it. For me it’s $200,000. See y’all there.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:58:04
See that’s what I thought too, but not according to the IRS. Look, I could be wrong and I hope I am, but too many Bitcoin experts have said the second you move your Bitcoin, it’s treated as a taxable event. But the IRS would ALSO want taxes paid as regular income when you later deposit USD into your bank account. Let’s be real, they have no idea what bitcoin is and they want theirs. They’re going to throw some high-profile Bitcoin millionaire in jail, just watch.

Tempted to bookmark this post to I-told-you-so every person saying the bull-run will go on uninterrupted. Be careful with your money. If your strategy is not dollar-cost averaging a regular percentage of your spendable income, you are engaged in extreme risk in an unregulated market. Anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:31:56
I'd be totally ok with this.

@_date: 2017-08-27 19:52:02
Look up dollar cost average. One strategy would be to buy a small amount on a regular basis like $5/week or $100/mo - however you want to do it based on your own ability and tolerance. That way you end up averaging out of there are dips. You also feel it less as you get into a position in the asset.

@_date: 2019-08-09 06:28:44
Now if the price goes up, buy a little more, and if it goes down, still buy a little more. Keep working at a job and keep buying what you can, without going overboard and putting a strain on yourself financially and one day you’re going to have a very large position in BTC.

I don’t want to say anything publicly on this thread, but there is a way to sell Bitcoin for fiat currency (many different countries) and pay 0% capital gains. Keep looking. Let other people pay taxes, who want to pay them.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:00:25
There is more than one way, but I’ll say this, you’re barking up the right tree. Not the non-profit though, that sounds illegal.

@_date: 2017-10-20 10:09:20
Don’t transfer back to USD. Get a Bitpay card and load only the USD you need, in order to pull profit. Putting USD back in your bank account insures capital gains tax.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:27:43
Yes, I love Doge. Decentralized from what I can tell. It’s no Bitcoin, but why not, y’know?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:02:14
Get your money out of whatever fiat currency it's in and into BTC. Don't put it all in, because you need to pay your bills and taxes in your currency. The market doesn't go up or down in a straight line, so look up dollar-cost-averaging and start getting a position in Bitcoin immediately and hold for a long time. Eventually, you won't be converting your Bitcoin to currency, the Bitcoin will be your wealth.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:44:19
Right now, the IRS isn't going to hunt you down for anything less than purchases of $20,000 in BTC or more, however, yes, officially, you owe capital gains tax at the end of the year once you've sold that BTC for anything else. But the IRS wants USD, not BTC. They can seize your bank account of garnish your wages, but they can't go into your cold storage and take your Bitcoin - that's the whole purpose of Bitcoin. It is decentralized. Your cold storage isn't your bank account, it is your actual bank, which you own.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:47:23
It’s called “deflation” or a deflationary asset. There is an unlimited supply of dollars. Because USD is backed by nothing, the treasury can print them forever, inflating their value and making them worthless. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of only 21 million BTC, so as demand increases, the limited supply makes each Bitcoin more valuable. Happy holding!

BTC could go to $0 the day after you cut your government a check. I didn’t say they won’t come after you. They will absolutely make some examples. But your Bitcoin, if it is not in an exchange, is not available to them unless you give it to them. You have absolute control over your private keys. You, definitely should pay taxes. Whether or not anyone else wants to, that’s up to them.

@_date: 2017-10-20 20:41:47
is absolutely correct. Right now, the IRS isn't going after people who've purchased small amounts of BTC and then traded them for other cryptocurrencies, however, officially, that trade is indeed a taxable event, incurring taxes for the current year. Today, you're not going to be chased down for those taxes, but a year from now, you may well be - better safe than sorry if you feel that way.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:55:10
You are both [right]( and not. The IRS wants USD. If you never convert BTC or any other cryptocurrency into BTC, you have not realized gains. However, at the same time, a trade of BTC is a "taxable event." The tax code contradicts itself in thousands of ways. Nobody here is your accountant or financial advisor. It's up to you to do what you think is right. But, 99.9% of all people transacting in BTC are not paying taxes to any government. That is the entire purpose of why Bitcoin was created. It is a decentralized money based on cryptography, it does not belong to any government. That does not mean your government can't justify throwing you in jail because they say you owe them money in their own currency - we are almost guaranteed to see that precedent soon.

That is a really good question on the subject of a tax document from Coinbase. To my knowledge no. As of right now, it’s completely on you to report. Although the IRS has clearly stated since 2014 that capital gains is owed on appreciating cryptocurrency, there just isn’t the precedent set on how it’s handled yet. If you ask 5 accountants you’ll get 5 different answers. It’s important to keep records yourself, because there is a good chance a year or two down the road, you’ll have a tax liability if you purchased BTC with your bank account. That is, unless the market tanks and instead everyone holding loses everything. Wild times and new territory!

@_date: 2017-05-04 22:02:11
Who is asking? Nobody is reporting that money unless he is. If he gets audited, he just deposited cash from already taxed income he'd been saving for a long time. The IRS doesn't use your bank account to decide your taxable income. This isn't [Estonia]( . The U.S. tax code is archaic and Bitcoin is a gray area.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:44:11
I watched this, sat there for a while, then sold.

Don't you dare pay capital gains tax. Keep that sale off your balance sheet. You just deposited cash you saved.

A country like the U.S. could make it illegal. It would immediately be illegal to have a bitcoin option on any company's website transacting in the U.S. - that would drive the price down but Bitcoin would still remain viable for black market transactions. Bitcoin takes psychological confidence just like all currencies.
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:03:24

@_date: 2017-05-04 23:21:59
I see your point. However, there are plenty of people purchasing cars and real estate with cash and not reporting the purchase price. I'm not saying it's right or ethical. "Render to Caesar" - but Bitcoin isn't the property of any government.

Gresham's law states that "bad money drives out good". Long-term, I believe the trend is up from here, but after pouring over the charts of Etherium and Litecoin, I got to feeling there would be a pull-back for a while. I only sold half.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:07:07
If you spend actual Bitcoin to buy goods, rather than cashing out for USD, you do not need to pay taxes. If you have a massive influx of cash into your personal bank account and get audited, good luck explaining that. The real risk is on you and it's your decision whether or not to pay. Also what said is correct about 1099-INT being reported by your exchange, but also what linked to from the actual IRS.

@_date: 2017-05-04 22:49:24
Pay taxes on the house, but don't pay unnecessary "capital gains" on paper dollars. That's all I'm saying. But this is the problem with playing Bitcoin for currency gains, rather than waiting to use Bitcoin for purchases without exchanging it for paper currency. Notice USD say "Federal Reserve Note" - it's never your money in the first place and they can take it whenever they want it.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:38:10
Great question! Two reasons, it's an insurance strategy allowing you to use a small percentage of your monthly income, rather than sinking a large amount of capital at once. By disciplined, regular, dollar-cost-averaging, you take some of the price risk out of a volatile market. Basically, you buy a little at the same time each week and hope the average price you pay is a good one, also hoping that Bitcoin will be worth more on average in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:17:31
This is the secret. Accumulation is key, not necessarily current price. You have to fight the capital gain mentality. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:06:42
Sounds like an interesting Google...try "one dollar deed" or "sell house for one dollar" - I'm not saying do this. But interesting to know that it is done, no?
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:03:04
Ok, explain.
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:06:06
Yes, technically, it's still capital gains, it's just not visible to the IRS if you do it say from a physical wallet to a seller who doesn't show your identity. But if it's a seller who records that data, you could be liable for capital gains. Some of this comes down to personal responsibility. But you have to remember, cryptocurrency was created to liberate the individual from taxation and central bank manipulation.

That ASICs comment actually sounded like Satoshi's voice.
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:47:36
If they are receiving what looks like a dividend, it just means they are decreasing their holding while the value goes up (in other words, selling). The dollar amount they hold increases but the Bitcoin amount decreases. It's possible that they are trading one cryptocurrency for another, then trading back, and increasing along the way. That's possible because a lot of cryptocurrencies have been on bull runs.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:18:00
How do you short Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:23:10
Totally this. I'm the same. I want to spend Bitcoin for goods and services in the future as opposed to trying to convert back to some fiat currency for capital gains. Acquiring as much Bitcoin as possible is a little different that hodling in that sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:20:15

Buy more every single time the price dips. Even if it's just $20, $50, $100 - whatever isn't a lot to you. If you've been doing that, you keep getting more BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:57:41
Dollar cost average. Don't blow your wad. Buy some now, then, next week if it goes up, buy a little more. If it goes down, buy the same amount in dollars and get a little more than if the price had been higher. Repeat this with discipline and one day soon, you're going to have a lot of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:20:23

Here is what you do: Never exchange cryptocurrency back for dollars. You can spend Bitcoin for goods and services. The IRS wants tax on Federal Reserve notes, not Bitcoin. But if you're a U.S. citizen and your Bitcoin holdings go up in value and you convert them to dollars in an exchange (as opposed to cash from an individual) - there is no hiding it - you owe 20% capital gains tax.
