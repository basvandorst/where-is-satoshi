One major issue is ensuring that the method of determining blocksize is not manipulatable to the point of exploitation/disruption
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:48:23
Oh quit it. It's some of bitcoin's biggest involved companies. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:10:35
To be honest, how would a "dynamic block size" that adjusts to the activity of the network be any different than simply having an uncapped blocksize?

While it is easy to say "The same results can be gotten with a keylogger", the real significance of this is that multibit it storing your unencrypted password in memory. This can lead to all sorts of attacks that reach further than simple malware. For example, a live dump of the ram can grab the password.

Gotcha, just got my pass. Thanks

Why does the protocol have this limit?
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:28:55
I actually don't have a solution, because I still liked how it was Bitcoin bowl not Bitpay bowl. Its hard to advertise something you don't have control over if everyone doesn't understand how it works. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:45:31
I believe it has to do with money transmission laws

Wouldnt there be absolutely no debate as to whether they had actual hash power backing zenpool because their received coins would all come from a single miner entity?  Or maybe even the fact that so many blocks are coming from a certain entity?

Oh God yes. In fact, earlier today I was thinking about how awesome it feels to have so much news/developments/drama in a constant stream on the subreddit. The front page recently consists of people loving themselves for using change tip, which has been around (admittedly in a more basic form) for a while. Barring the monetary rewards of a bubble, it's the excitement of the moment that makes it so much fun.

Interesting idea, but i think that the thought of bruteforcing big wallets can easily be prevented by complex passwords. With a proper password, even some of the most powerful machines will be unable to crack it before justin bueber has grandkids. However, the key leaking is a valid concern but i cannot think of a practical defense. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:22:57
Haha you're so naive. That's not because of the banking industry it's because of record labels which most likely wouldn't see any harm from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:08:44
I have little knowledge on this subject, but I believe the fact that it used livecode helped the reverse engineering.

My technologically inept but business savvy father just called me to tell me about how he got an email about them accepting bitcoin. He really was surprised that this bitcoin thing is being used for stuff he has always used. Bitcoin adoption is skyrocketing guys, and it's expanding beyond the alpaca socks and the obscure cafes that occupied the bitcoin economy a mere year ago. Ask anyone who was here pre-april 2013 and let them confirm how far bitcoin has come. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:56:47
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:07:02
I understand your argument and agree with it, but I think a lot of people are hesitant to do it on a commercial scale for fear of legal issues. Tons of people on ebay sell "piece of paper +.5 btc" and they ship you an actual piece of paper so they have proof of delivery. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:09:38
How much was on the line if you dont mind me asking
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:31:37
This really is a huge step in solidifying Bitcoins legitimacy.  
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:19:42
It was to prove Ver wrong for 1m
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:59:37
I think it almost forced the public to recognize it's legitimacy. But another issue I've found is that people who have vague knowledge of bitcoin's decentralization are asking me "Who's paying for it, Bitcoins not a company!" Which leads me to believe that this might have made a lot of people think of bitcoin as a corporation along the lines of the others xx-bowl sponsors.  
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:13:46
I imagine it does allow for plausible deniability
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:22:54
This is, of course, huge speculation on my part. I bet it has something to do with people complaining to walmart about a giftcard issue as a result of an egifter purchase and walmart decided to cut it due to increased customer support involvement
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:18:51
Yeah, this is just showing how a presently used bitcoin's protocol was also being used by a financial transmitting company in a conceptually similar manner many years ago. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:24:54


@_date: 2015-05-04 03:09:21


@_date: 2014-12-05 05:00:41
Can you explain the "not quite right" which i believe are called shares and how they work?
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:11:42
I'm assuming it's due to the difficulty of spending the gift card in a PoS situation. While I have never used a walmart e-card, I heard it requires a manager to manually allow the gift card transaction to take place. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:25:50
Its something about a bittorrent sharing code

The contents of this email isn't public, correct?
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:07:18
Isn't there evidence of a bitcoin transaction?  I highly doubt LE would pick a random transaction because I imagine they're liable if the owner is pursued. I guess its possible LE sent the coins to themselves. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:43:57
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:04:14
What are the examples that you are referring to? I haven't been following super closely
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:09:28

Its probably that spam email that pretends like someone needs your help decrypting a wallet
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:40:11
Guys please be careful sending your money to anyone, this is most likely a scam considering how many fake btc sell only exchanges have been popping up

Localbitcoin's allows you to meet up with people like craigslist. Look for a bitcoin atm in your area if you're willing to pay a small premium. How long do you have before it expires?

I think he's hinting at normal payment processor (guessed?) fees
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:41:30
I think people misunderstand his intentions. He wants the network attacked because if he can do it, so can the bad guys. He's charging for his work in what essentially a short job with his expertise. Who can decide what he can and can't do when the system is decentralized.  Have a solution?  Then be the hero saving the day from the world's evil (peter todd) and push your code (besides charlie lee, he tried that)

The account used to post that message was signed up using the gmx email, which means the email may have been compromised for a while before the public found out.

As long as the degree of which speed increases is constant for everyone, it will have little practical effect on the network besides diluting the influence of each GH

Isn't that true of any new ASIC?  
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:08:14

It's the first economically safe way of accepting btc in these stages of early development. Like many people say, it would be impossible for bitcoin to succeed without a time of volatility
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:09:00
Youvcan withdraw btc from an unverified gox account unless you log in through tor/a blacklisted ip. Coins should be there a little after 6 confirms

On blockchain.info you can view inputs in custom send. Just multiply it by how many bytes it is per input (I forget how much but its a sub Kb number)
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:18:08
Someone had to have gotten control of the 2 factor auth qr code, perhaps he saved in on his computer?  I doubt its a gox hack of sorts because i feel like there would be more reports

The difference is bitcoin is *our* pump and dump scheme
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:17:02
Honestly i think the best way to get these things mainstream acceptance is to allow fiat purchases, but a discount with bitcoin. That way regular 'plebs' can access the content but see the benefit in getting some btc

How important is it for amazon purchases
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:11:49
Real answer:
Coinbase goes off a mix of exchange rates, most notably mtgox and bitstamp, but mtgox doesnt have nearly as much of a difference to the bitstamp price as it usually does and their method of computing it makes it higher

Can vouch for this being the best idea. In my opinion bitcoin qt is kinda old school, for if you dont open it for a week its gotta download the blockchain for the past week, not too long, but far from quick and easy. Blockchain.info is the most (from a technological standpoint) trusted ewallet, as the wallet is decrypted locally
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:45:43
Easiest thing to do is export private keys from electrum, get the blockchain app from cydia (i think its there, pulled from appstore) and make a blockchain wallet with those keys. Blockchain.info is known for being relatively secure
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:40:10
Mtgox does it too now. It does go to the miner though, i checked
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:52:40
Check if theres an api on the account
