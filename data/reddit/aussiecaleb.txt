I posted this yesterday but had to remove due to limits on my hosting account. I got the ol' Reddit Hug of Death. I am resubmitting this to different subs slowly so hopefully it won't happen. If this is not allowed admins, then please let me know or delete. Thanks

South Korea, it will blow off by tomorrow. Now is a good time to top up.

To be honest, not really. Unless someone else has any ideas? If I hear anything I'll let you know.

Hindsight is 20-20

That would be the crypto full loop.

2017 was a really BIG bull year for Crypto.. not sure if 2018 can quite match that... but even if it goes half as well you can make some serious money.

Please note, I am not a financial adviser. It was just an interesting idea I thought of. I really hope it does well for you over the year!

Oh I really hope you haven't. USDT isn't going anywhere.

Incorrect. Not all the coins move together. Take today for example, some coins like NEO are up, yet others like Stellar are down...

Only one way to find out. Crypto is the wild west of investing... be prepared to lose it all if everything goes sour!

Don't know if it is just for alt coins or just crypto in general... it all has pretty much gone up. Really crazy to see.

I think I got the Reddit Hug of Death. Working on getting this back up and running.

I hope you're a troll.
