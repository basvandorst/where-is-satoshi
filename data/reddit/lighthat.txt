I looked on bitcoin-qt after i closed the mining prompts and i see that my coins will mature after 111 more blocks.

There are two kinds, one that involves filtering out mature pictures from a series of pictures which is really east (just filter out the penises and the topless dudes, and the half-naked fems and you're in). A set of four is only 4 cents but they can be done so quickly. The other kind are the ones where you pair a picture with a building that are worth 5 cents each. These are similarly easy but have a slightly larger payout.
I have a quick eye so i do manage to pump these out quickly, your results may vary depending on how fast you do these. You get faster the more you do

You'll need expensive machines to make any notable profit off of bitcoin mining. Even if you do find a block when mining by yourself, it will only be worth a couple hundred dollars. Not to mention you would only solve a block, like, once every 3 months [varies depending on your mining machine]
Do it for fun, not for profit. Otherwise you'll need to invest quite a bit of money to make any sort of profit off of mining.

But dollars are a centralized currency and printing just devalues the currency - sure. but the money itself is still backed by something: debt. The fact that not anyone can just start making dollars by themselves makes them scarce
the fact that it's a dollar does not make it bad, debt-backed currency is bad. bitcoins are still dollars just as much as a normal dollar is, it's just backed by the desire to trade with it.
And yes gold coins may not be easily divisible, but they are divisible because you can exchange them. You can just make smaller gold coins.

I told you that, that kind of argument made no sense in the very next line. "Of course this is what everyone loves to say and it just isn't feasible."


You're not representing the argument properly. Your changing only half of the analogy, of course it doesn't make any sense.


Nope, but we definitely need the engineers over at Apple to do it for us, hence why they get paid the way they do. Straw manning the argument - politicans are government specialists, and we need them to do government for us.


So you're suggesting we hire politicians privately to read the law for us and tell us how to vote? Fuck no. That's stupid and just promotes the same self-interest that we have now because they'll just tell you how they want you to vote, there's no way in hell they'll give you an unbiased picture.


Centralization is usually better in a lot of aspects, usually when the market isn't homogenized. Currency is currently homogenized, so adding new currencies for the same market are beneficial. Centralization of an industry is pretty good (such as in the OS industry now). It's currently and oligopoly, so we have essentially a form of centralization with competition to encourage consumer-interested business rather than self-interested business (because being consumer-interested brings customers to you from the competitors, and thus, fulfills the ultimate self-interest of a company.)
The same is true for our government. If something on the scale of government was put into private hands, we'd have unfathomable amounts of corruption and a hyperpluralist system, the worst kind of government system imaginable.

In the classic college vs work example, you can't go back and choose to work instead of going to college once you've already decided to work. So you're telling me that example is invalid?


I'm gonna say this again too since you missed it last time.
The best alternative is available. When bitcoin was at $1200 you had the option to either hold it or sell it.

He's not looking to invest, he's looking to secure his wealth.

As much as people on like to think holding is best, the fact of the matter is that most people who have money in bitcoin are not holding it and expecting to use it to buy something down the road. Of course, holding is only useful if you're going to invest in Bitcoin's future long-term.

Gold is wanted for its use in jewelry, its resistance to corrosion, its malleability, its conducting properties, and for investment purposes. It's scarce and available in many different quantities, so fungible to an extent.
The only difference is that you can touch it. You can't seriously sit here and argue that Bitcoin has more worth than gold, can you? Because that's stupid. Bitcoin, *by design*, is worthless. That's why it's so difficult to use as a currency right now. It's not based off of anything.

I...what? That's basic economics. If money is not recycled (i.e, hoarded) then it's not being spent. When money isn't spent for a long time, people begin to run out of money, because every time a hoarder gets some of that money, it doesn't go back into circulation. It creates false value. On a large scale, like what happened to bitcoin, you can see it incredibly clearly. People hoarded their bitcoins and this created false demand and a false price to go with it, so many people started buying bitcoins, driving the price up even more, because they though this price increase wasn't artificial (i.e, not due to false scarcity due to hoarding). Hoarders saw this massive price increase and began to cash out and make tons of money. Everyone else followed suit because they wanted to get out to minimize losses. And now Bitcoins are worth half of what they were.
People made money by hoarding. This is the inherent problem with Bitcoin. With a fiat currency, this isn't the case. You lose money by hoarding, so you have to put your money back into the economy to get more back to counteract inflation....i.e, you need to invest. Investment isn't just putting your money into a high-return account (these don't exist, every savings account will net you interest less than inflation rates). Investment gives money to people to do things with. It creates companies, creates raw goods, creates finished products, allows for R&amp;D. Not just for the good of the value of the currency, but for the good of society as a whole, too. This doesn't happen when currency isn't recycled, because people have no need to risk investment when they can sit on their money and make more money.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:53:49
Ugh. This is so cancerous.
The 'hoarding' done by people with fiat currency is investment, not hoarding like sitting in the bank doing nothing like people hoarding bitcoins. It's cycled back into the market somehow. The value of bitcoin is increasing because it's deflationary, and the value of the pound isn't because it's inflationary. So the last panel is irrelevant. The previous panel is wrong.

You're just misunderstanding the statement. You, and everyone else on hear "why spend bitcoin if it will be worth more in the future" and think that it's an absolute statement and that economists think that everyone who gets bitcoin will just look at it and never use it.
The statement is a matter of investment. When a currency like Bitcoin is going to increase in value on its own, there is no investment necessary for your money to hold its value. with a currency like USD, you *must* invest or else your money will lose purchasing power if it sits in the bank. This statement applies not to the money that you use to, e.g, pay your bills, buy your clothes, etc; but to the money that you have at the end of every month that you didn't use that typically goes into a savings account.
When people have a lot of money or are smart with their money, that money goes into an investment. But with Bitcoin, that isn't necessary. Sure, you can *make more money* with Bitcoin investments, but the fundamental fact remains that if you can see significant returns *without* that risk, why would you risk? To put this into perspective, I'm not talking about low-risk investments. If bitcoin sees widespread adoption, there will be **zero** risk in hoarding your bitcoins. You are 100% guaranteed positive ROI, ignoring anomalies like attacks on the network and your wallets being hacked. Thus, more people hoard, which means less people spend their bitcoins, and since there's no central entity to correct that by printing more to keep the value consistent, the price will continue to be volatile. This doesn't even factpr in the effect it will have on hindering growth of the economy. People like venture capitalists won't be as prolific or as wealthy, so new companies will have a harder time getting into the market, because if anyone has a significant amount of money in Bitcoin they can just put it on a paper wallet and enjoy their increasing net worth as deflation spirals out of control (because everyone else with a significant hold in BTC will be doing it too)
Additionally, the lack of circulation will obviously be a problem for Bitcoin because there are a limited number in existence. And before people come out and say "IT'S INFINITELY DIVISIBLE, KID!" remember that if your goal is to get the currency used by people internationally as an actual currency instead of the "commodity" that it is now, you need consistency and you need...practicality. People are notorious for sucking at math. Sure, we might be able to go down from MicroBTC to Satoshis, but now you need everyone else to adjust to that. And if you're dealing with decimals (i.e fractions of a MicroBC instead of Satoshis) the math gets harder for people and will inhibit adaptation. If you go from MicroBTC to Satoshis, now you have a change in vernacular and people who aren't up-to-date might offer "5 coins" with coin meaning whatever denomination is official at the time, and the seller might be offended expecting 5 Satoshis and the buyer might feel fine because they think they offered 5 MicroBTC.
There is also the issue of governments *never, ever ever, ever* accepting Bitcoin as their official currency to replace fiat because it takes away their control over the country's finances. Whatever your view on that is, governments are here to stay, and they will continue to be the  obstacle to Bitcoin's widespread adaptation as a currency. Remember that all the government has to do is get 51% of the hashing power and they can effectively kill Bitcoin. Remember that the US alone can do that without even putting a dent in their budget. And remember that if Bitcoin ever becomes a threat to their currency (i.e, people using Bitcoin to circumvent the government's control of commerce) they can *easily* get the necessary hashing power to put a stop to it. Don't forget that they have all of the seized silk road coins at their disposal. They're a lot of coins now, imagine ten years in the future when everyone is considered rich for having a MicroBTC. Offloading all of that at once will devastate the market. It might recover or it might not. Or just the fact that having that many coins is probably enough for them to buy the necessary hashing power to kill Bitcoin, depending on how much hashing power the network has at the time the government decides to attack the coin, if they even decide to.
Those are the pitfalls with Bitcoin's deflationary nature that nobody here wants to acknowledge.

No it isn't, but the bank and the IRS probably know you're self employed because you're doing it legally by registering a business name and opening a bank account as that business, right? In that case, your funds wouldn't be frozen. It honestly sounds to me like...you have no experience handling money, at all.
That dude collecting unemployment coming in and depositing $4000 in cash on a wednesday at 11:30 AM to his personal bank account, with no record of a registered business under their name, who's legally single?

Because many goods are perishable or lose style, while a $1 note is always worth $1, but the purchasing power of that note may become stronger or weaker.
People sell things so they make more money so that they can invest that money and make more money.
The bad thing about deflationary currency is that you don't have to invest. You can just sit on your money. So you sell goods, make money, and sit on it instead of investing it, which stagnates economic growth.

Look, I know we're on (i.e legion against the fiat antichrist) but let's not pull shit out of our ass and make irrelevant points.


But that doesn't matter because you're guaranteed your money up to a point, a point that basically nobody here will reach. This system is called fractional reserve and is 100% definitely no-questions-asked guaranteed to happen with Bitcoin if it becomes a universal currency. And because I can see this coming, exist is the wrong word because the money still exists, it's just not with the bank.


Minus the fact that they can't.


Again, you're guaranteed up to a point - and once again, a point that pretty much nobody here except for *maybe* a couple have any realistic concern about.


Which only happens to people who are actually using their money illegitimately (i.e, seemingly unemployed with lots of cash, erratic deposit schedule with vastly differing amounts..) The number of people who this happens to when it's not deserved is incredibly small compared to the number of people it doesn't happen to, and when it does happen you can fix it.

Unfortunately, people don't see something as valuable because it is new as much as you think. It doesn't matter that gold had a lower demand four years after it was first used as a currency. All that matters is that bitcoin, right now, has an astronomically lower demand compared to gold. That's what's driving the price difference. And it's going to be that way for a *very long time.* As such, it's *safer* for the practical person to buy precious metals in larger volume for wealth security than bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:07:06




Well, first, yes, things have inherent worth. Like gold, which has its chemical properties. Obviously when you think about it in terms of something have an inherent dollar worth, nothing has inherent worth. Of course gold has speculative growth, so does everything else. But Bitcoin is almost entirely speculative, which is why it crashed so much recently.
Bitcoin's only worth comes from demand and scarcity. It has no inherent worth. It's useless. But the protocol associated with it is what makes it demanded, because it can *represent* money due to its scarce and difficult-to-create nature.
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:09:08


and both people need a bitcoin address, what's your point? Not to mention back accounts are free. accounts that cost money every month are higher-than-normal interest accounts.


You can't because of bureaucratic reasons as Frankeh said, if Bitcoin ever poses a significant threat to banks then it's basically a couple lines of code and a phone call and now banks are back to being better for money transferring.


Bitcoin indeed has the advantage here. But 1 advantage that *most* people won't realistically use in any reasonable volume is hardly "too many advantages."
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:16:36


Already wrong. The entire problem with bitcoin is because it promotes hoarding over investing.


It'd be nice if Bitcoin existed in some magical fairy land where people were willing to take their bitcoins out of the economy for the better of the network, but that isn't even remotely the case. Hoarders will wait until the price increases due to the artifical deflation that the hoarding caused in the first place, leading to the subsequent crash, the exact thing that happened twice already in the past. The 'recovery' was because it has become widely adapted and increased in value, but this cycle is not going to stop as Bitcoin gets bigger because of the very reason I listed above - deflationary currency promotes hoarding over investing. When the crash happens when Bitcoin is widely adopted, everyone is going to say "fuck it, this is stupid, i just lost half of my net worth," bitcoin then collapses.


"Outweigh deflation?" Nobody wants to outweigh deflation. Hoarders like deflation, that's the entire reason that they horde. And it doesn't put pressure on any investing at all, it only promotes hoarding.

Except...we're talking about investments...which is textbook economics.


Yes it does? The opportunity cost of selling your shares at $6000 vs selling them at $200? They're both mutually exclusive events with different outcomes...so there is obviously an opportunity cost associated with them. The benefit of selling at $6000 is making lots of money but losing out on any gains after that. The benefit of waiting and selling at $200 is making money, but losing the money you could have had by selling at $6000 at a chance of making more if there was a price increase that you could take advantage of, **and** you also lose the opportunity to invest that profit you could have made if you sold your hypothetical shares at $6000 and make more money. The link I provided explains that [pretty clearly for you]( if you don't believe me. If you don't like wikipedia [you can have another source]( pay particular attention to the second definition there.
If you need a picture, [I made a graph in Paint for you]( Both scenarios end in profit, but one gives more profit, and the methods of getting to each scenario are mutually exclusive (you can't sell 1 share at $6000 and sell the same share at $200 later on) so there **must** be an opportunity cost associated with it, which would be the little equation I gave you there.
Yes, it's nice to go from $100 to $200, but when I could have went from $100 to $6000 I have a perfectly valid reason to be upset. Thanks for reinforcing my point, though.

That's what you're paying taxes for - buying the ability to use such services. If you don't like how they're spending your money, you're free to leave the country.
Of course this is what everyone loves to say and it just isn't feasible. I think it's much more practical to fix a problem rather than say "if you don't like it, stfu." I think government is important, just implemented wrong. We need politicans and the like because, let's be honest, you're not going to sit down and read through thousands of pages of law and then debate them with your fellow citizens - and if you do, almost everyone else won't. The problem isn't that *government itself is inherently bad*, but that *the way government is implemented is bad.*
But the system is made so that you can't just sell to one person and not to another, this is why the healthcare system in America is the way that it is. If everyone pays, it's easier to make sure the people who want the service get the service. But government implementation is usually more than just service. A lot of bills and acts include funding for R&amp;D (and pork, of course), such as American healthcare. These are things that most people just don't have the foresight to do alone, so we need a government to handle it for us.

The claim isn't that bitcoin would fail because it was worth too much.


Not quite. Borrowing culture is spreading a large cost over many years to make it more affordable, generally. You *could* save $150,000 over 20 years and buy a house, but who knows how much that house is going to be in 20 years? And then you have to deal with not having a house of your own for 20 years. Instead, borrow that $150,000 and pay it back over time as your income allows - this is how borrowing works and it only fails when banks give out too much money, or people poorly manage their money, or unforeseen circumstances takes away income.


Well, inflation is healthy, because as the person who answered that question suggests, "Assuming demand for the currency trends upward long-term (and if it doesn't, it wouldn't really be a successful currency), the value of a single bitcoin will increase. Inflation is healthy and necessary for a currency because it encourages people to spend and/or invest their cash, as opposed to deflation which encourages people to hoarde, further deflating the currency (by decreasing supply)." And this is true. If you can make more money by not spending, why would you spend? And then money doesn't circulate. And then it crashes. Like what just happened recently. 


People will spend less when they know that saving money will give them more money. The claim isn't that nobody will spend, the claim is that not enough people will spend.
Let's remember that for Bitcoin to grow into a healthy community, we need to address problems and not be blinded by the perfect-world vision that people seem to have here. Bitcoin has serious problems in the long term. Deflationary currencies will not work on a massive scale.  This is why we don't have any deflationary currencies on a massive scale. They fail.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:35:26
It's deflation because the bitcoins available per user will continue to go down, this is an inherent property of Bitcoin because of increasing world population and coins entering wallets that will never be recovered, and, realistically, more and more people wanting to use bitcoins as it sees more widespread adaptation.

Okay so you're just misunderstanding the example.


It is available. You could sell or hold.


Yes it is. Just because you can't caluclate the opportunity cost at the time because of missing variables doesn't mean there is no opportunity cost associated with the decision.
So, tell me, the classic example of "going to college vs not" is then invalid because you can only know the opportunity cost of going to college and not going to college until you reach the future? If I'm in the future and I wish I had gone to college, are you telling me I can't model that scenario with an opportunity cost anymore? It doesn't matter that it's in the past.
It's so clear cut and I don't know why you can't grasp it. I can sell my share for $6000 or I can hold it in hopes that the value increases more. Here's the important part, I'll bold it for you so you don't miss it: **If I decide to hold it and check my portfolio a week later I have missed the opportunity to sell my share for $6000. Therefore any benefits associated with that decision - which is now the opportunity cost of deciding to hold the share - are now unavailable to me.**
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:10:05
We need speculators to stabilize the market. [You know the graph everyone is tired of?]( There's a reason it looks that way. Speculators will come and drive the value up astronomically, to encourage people to begin accepting bitcoin as a currency. After all the speculators dip, the currency returns to its actual value instead of the terrible inflated value that we have now, and *then* we can begin to think of Bitcoin as a currency, assuming it survives this rough transition.
Right now it's just a shitty commodity that is completely useless. It won't be a currency until many, many people being to accept it as a medium of trade.

It would be easy, all they have to do is purchase the mining hardware (or develop it themselves, something that isn't difficult as they endorse the use of SHA256 and may already have SHA256 ASICs for their own non-bitcoin use...and if not it would be trivial for such a large entity to get their hands on the means to produce their own). 1 PH/s probably costs then about $100 million if 1 GH/s is $100, and the current hashrate is I think, 5 PH/s? If Bitcoin actually posed a threat, it would be a drop in the ocean for them to spend $600 million dollars to get 51%+ of the network hashrate. There is the issue of time, it obviously wouldn't happen overnight, but the fact remains that if the US government is threatened by Bitcoin it will have no problem putting a stop to it. And that's only the US, nevermind cooperation by the rest of the NATO countries that would no doubt help with such an act.

When a gem hits its cap (you don't know at what value the gem caps) you get your money back and the gem is destroyed and a new gem is put in its place with the same cap.
Would make it interesting, and difficult to decide whether you should buy gems that are close to capped values (i.e 49, .99, 499, 74)

Why the fuck do people say this *all the time* when it means nothing! It doesn't matter* that there is more gold vs less bitcoins, there is **a lot** more gold traded per day than bitcoin. If the amount in circulation had as much to do with the price as everyone on this sub thinks it does, then how come bitcoin isn't worth 10-100x more than gold?
^^^* ^^^it ^^^does ^^^matter, ^^^just ^^^not ^^^very ^^^much ^^^in ^^^this ^^^context.
Gold has a **metric fuckton** of demand behind it with tremendous security and time-tested value maintenance; bitcoin has a skeptical user base, an uncertain future, and next to no demand relative to any of the precious metals.
**However it goes without saying** that you should definitely put some of your money into bitcoin to get your money out of Japan, just be smart and don't put it evenly in all three even though many people here will tell you to. Bitcoin is fun, nothing more at this point. Take it easy, put 5-10% into bitcoin and watch the market carefully and pull out as soon as you see the slightest sign of strange volatility.

I hate when people bring this up. It just shows that you don't have the slightest clue about even basic economics.
Bitcoin was worth $0 when it was created. Obviously nobody should be upset about any price drop because it was $0 when it was created, right? Even if we go back hundreds of bitcoins being only worth fifty cents, we should be happy?
If someone has an investment portfolio where they bought stocks at $100, the stock value goes up to $6000, and then back down to $200 and they *didn't* sell when it was worth so much, you expect someone to be *happy* that it's "higher than they started?"  ([more detailed explanation](

The bulk of gold is speculation, but you're kind of missing the point of what I'm saying.
Realistically, probably around 1% of all bitcoins purchased are used for the purpose of actually buying things. Gold on the other hand is probably more like, 20% consumer. But either way, the point of it all is that people love to call gold "just a shiny rock" when it's a lot more than that. It's actually useful and the only reason we used it as a secure investment was because it's scarce and already had value. Of course talking up gold here is a waste of time though, I just have to sit here and constantly tell myself that Bitcoin is the best thing in the world and everything else is stupid and pointless.
Gold is more valuable than bitcoin because it's both useful and a good investment. Bitcoin is only valuable because people want to come and make quick money, which is **not good for a currency.** When the price drops back down the $15 or so (or 90% of the world suddenly starts using bitcoin) like it should then we can actually talk about it as a currency, but right now it's just an extremely unstable commodity to most people who are buying it.

I'm not confused by it, I know what I'm talking about, I'm asking you why you think otherwise. Obviously it's a mark-to-market loss but we're not talking about the decision to sell at 200, we're talking about the difference between holding at $1200 and selling at $1200, mutually exclusive events with different outcomes meaning they *must* have an opportunity cost associated with them. My question has been outlined but I'll say it again.
In the classic college vs work example, you can't go back and choose to work instead of going to college once you've already decided to work. So you're telling me that example is invalid? (in reference to you saying "it's not an opportunity cost because it happened in the past", and if you had a BS in economics you would know that's complete bullshit)
The best alternative is available. When bitcoin was at $1200 you had the option to either hold it or sell it. (In reference to you saying the best alternative wasn't available)
I'm not asking for resources, I'm asking why **you** are compelled to say that there's no opportunity cost associated with two mutually exclusive decisions.

Only reason your logic works is because of this. This isn't the case, and never will be. People will not be using BTC as a primary means of exchange. People will always be using their local currency, except for a few occasions where hyperinflation might drive a handful of techie people in a country to use an alternative. It's a nice, optimistic thought, but let's be realistic.
People don't have to cash out. They can sit on their BTC and cash out when it's artificially inflated. That's why we've had two major crashes. *You have physical evidence that the design of a deflationary currency is flawed, twice*; there's no discussion to be had.

The way you execute a 51% attack is with hashrate, not with...market cap. The current hashrate is 6.7 PH/s. A *very* conservative $100 per GH/s, more than *double* the retail price, is perfectly fair, unless you feel I'm not making your argument strong enough by doing that? 
At that *very, very unrealistic* price per GH/s, it would only take $670 million (my previous $600 million was under the assumption of a network hashrate of 5 PH/s) to *match* the hashrate of the network. Accounting for jumps in hashrate over time because, as I said, this wouldn't happen overnight, it would *maybe* cost then a billion dollars...which is again, a drop in the ocean for the US government. You can't really argue with that. It's hard fact. You think they wouldn't jump at the chance to end something that would threaten the entire existence of the country for only $1 billion dollars? They simply don't see it as a threat and, quite frankly, neither do I as I've already mentioned in my OP.

It's not as much about successful investing vs failed investing as much as it is about getting the money to switch hands. Even in a failed investment, that money is still in the economy and out of the investors hands, and that's the key point in deflationary currency vs inflationary currency. But the idea is to invest in such a way that even a failed investment won't devastate your portfolio (diversifying) so that you can see a positive return with your investments and beat inflation and at the same time, make some money. Thing is with Bitcoin, you don't have to "beat" deflation. You don't have to invest at all. You can buy Bitcoin at any time, especially right now, and just wait and you'll eventually see a positive return short of a network collapse. Eventually, and in a reasonable timeframe, too.
Bitcoin will remain deflationary forever because when people lose wallets, those coins in those wallets are gone forever. In fact, once mining ceases, deflation becomes an even *greater* issue because we don't have new coins coming in to supplement those lost coins. Mining, for the purposes of new coin generation, won't cease for like 100 years (i forgot the exact date). That's 100 years for people to lose coins. Because of that, there is still incentive to hoard, but whether that incentive outweighs the incentive to invest at that point I can't really say because that will depend on how the Bitcoin economy grows from now until then, and the rate at which coins are lost. Wider adoption means more coins being lost every day, so 100 years from now when coin generation has mostly stopped, if Bitcoin survives that century and sees widespread adoption we're going to be seeing a lot of lost-forever coins.

I noticed you tried to apply a lot of these concepts to fiat currencies, but that isn't the case. When people hoard fiat currencies, their value decreases because more money is printed to offset hoarding. This is called **inflation** and is the difference between bitcoin and fiat currencies, in terms of value. So no, little of what I said applies to fiat currencies. As a result, I'm going to ignore your next point.

Please, instead of telling me I'm wrong, do me a favor and explain why I am incorrect, as I have done to you. I've been waiting. I really can't spell it out any clearer until I see what exactly you're not understanding. An opportunity cost is also not the state of a situation, it's a property of a decision. Nobody will describe this situation or any situation as an opportunity cost, but every decision that involves mutually exclusive options has an opportunity cost associated with it. Unfortunately, no matter how much you tell me I don't understand opportunity cost, that will not change.
