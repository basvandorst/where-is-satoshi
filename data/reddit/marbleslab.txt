Great website. 
Would like to request that once I go to my unique URL, I'm presented with just my portfolio? In future you could add graphical features, charts, breakdown by currency.
Would also suggest making it so people are shown the 'top 10' currencies upon first visiting the page with the additional option to search for the more unfamiliar coins.

If MtGox disappears and highlights the lack of protection in Bitcoin. Would you want to hold $1,000 on another exchange? $50,000? $100,000? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:00:41
Considering 200,000 BTC is $100,000,000+, a lot. I'd assume lawyers fees won't come to more than a few million dollars.

Regardless of what other people think, I feel MtGox have been good at communication on this particular issue. They have made 3 updates over the last week and did an interview with Forbes. As someone who holds a lot of cash in MtGox, this is all I really need? If they had made little or no communication, that'd be a different story.

Instant transfers isn't such a big deal for migrant workers who are sending home their monthly pay packet - it can wait a day. It's virtually free to do this.
I disagree. I think it's actually a lot **harder** for your average grandma in a remote Bangladeshi village to receive bitcoin. Especially when you consider she has no reliable Internet access. Assuming she's used the Internet before.

The fact that none of these guys have done anything other than put up a website bragging about their Wall Street credentials tells me that they are bad news. No statement on what will happen to our $100,000,000 worth of BTC. No statement on how exactly they plan to rehabilitate MtGox (beyond simply *with time, money and expertise*). 
Just some pipe-dream scam to win support... *hey! we're doing it for the BITCOIN community! c'mon guys! give us your $100,000,000! you do care about Bitcoin don't you? What are you waiting for then?!*
Now, can we all forget about the Sunlot scam and the idea of rehabilitation and focus our efforts elsewhere (such as making enough noise that the trustee agrees NOT to treat the customers' 200,000 BTC as belonging to MtGox). Until someone from Sunlot personally guarantees that they won't touch our 200k BTC and takes full *personal* responsibility to return them, I'm going to consider Sunlot as being an unscrupulous scam.

They are unbanked because they are migrant workers that don't need bank accounts. They stay in the UAE to earn money to send back home and then go back home. They don't need bank accounts, mortgages, loans or saving accounts.

@_date: 2014-03-05 16:22:33
Thanks. My point is that although Bitcoin is fantastic to provide the unbanked with access to Internet retailing -- it's pretty poor for the Western consumer. Why would I buy from someone with Bitcoin, knowing that if the goods don't arrive or are faulty, I stand relatively little chance of getting any kind of refund or replacement. It's all down to the person's goodwill. Sometimes, the trusted third-party is required to instill consumer trust. I'd warn everyone against purchasing goods over the Internet using Bitcoin. Trezor, Butterfly Labs, and plenty of other smaller ones have taught me this. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:55:10
As I said, it costs next to nothing for labourers to send money home right now in Dubai. There are money transfer services all over the place that are far more convenient than Bitcoin and there's little (if any) currency risk.

MtGox is a HUGE deal. 7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. $500,000,000 stolen/lost due to poor infastructure. Sure, it won't be so much of an issue in a few years but you have to remember, a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts people lost sickening amounts of money. 
China 'banning' Bitcoin will go one of two ways. It'll either encourage people to sit up and take notice, or it'll taint Bitcoin and other governments will attempt similar steps. 
Given its nature, it can never be killed, but if we're talking strictly about the price, I think MtGox and China can and have done some damage.

That's no reason to blindly accept the first offer that's put in front of us. I get that you're highly vocal on this (and John actually held you up as if you were a representative of the creditors on Sunday, I think this thread shows otherwise). 
My point is, rehabilitation may be good, but the terms of the offer needs to be stipulated at every possible opportunity. The leaked Sunlot document has proven that they're not exactly trustworthy. Now they're asking for $10,000,000 **out** of MtGox cash/ creditors potential funds. Why? Why do they need to **pay themselves** $10,000,000 for something that could probably be achieved for $5,000,000? What justification do they have? Not to mention how John kept telling everyone that this is exactly what they wouldn't do. Crooks.

I don't understand you. My point is that this conversation with Mark never happened and that Tiraspol fabricated it in order to get people behind the 'SaveMtGox!' campaign that is essentially a way of using my money to bankroll someone else's business plan. This is the first time I've heard of Tiraspol and yet he's allegedly in contact with Mark (who hasn't been in contact with anyone in weeks). Moreover, the nature of the conversation is obviously confidential and if true, would leave Mark in an even bigger mess. 
Why would I have senseless anger? I'm just pointing out the obvious that 50% of people who have downvoted this thread are also thinking. This conversation never happened. Tiraspol is a nobody. Mark wouldn't suddenly break his silence over the last few weeks to speak to a nobody. Mark wouldn't suddenly break his court gagging order in order to pass a hefty judgement on himself. It's not anger, it's common sense. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 09:24:58
This then begs the question, what exactly are Sunlot going to do for $10,000,000 that they can't do for $9,000,000 or $5,000,000? Having followed the Google Hangout on Sunday, I think John Betts made it rather clear that they (Sunlot) would be paying for all the investigative work themselves. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:37:15
My point is, $500,000,000 worth of users funds or BTC has been 'stolen' from *bitcoin enthusiasts*. Out of MtGox's 500,000 verified customers, I'd say about 25,000+ people lost funds that day. These 25,000 are part of Bitcoin's core **early adoptors** who have now lost some confidence in the system, are less likely to invest in Bitcoin again, less likely to recommend their friends and family do and altogether less involved. 
To say *MtGox is gone* as a positive, although I understand the sentiment, is still a wholly negative thing for Bitcoin IMO, if we are focusing on the price.

Can anyone actually from NL comment on this? I went to Amsterdam earlier this year and tried looking for places to spend Bitcoin (via Google and CoinMap) and can't remember finding any. Ideally I wanted a coffee shop, but I would've taken a bar/cafe/restaurant too. Found nothing in Amsterdam. So either I didn't search well enough and there must be 1000+ in Amsterdam alone that accept Bitcoin, or title is misleading?

I've been buying Bitcoin since 2011 - I trust facts, not faith. 
I'm merely pointing out that people shouldn't get so excited over things that they don't know much about. Yes, there are plenty of Filipino workers in the service industry in Dubai, but there are also plenty of kiosks that will transmit their cash back home at 0% fee. In fact, a lot of bank accounts in Dubai do money transfers worldwide for free. Their family can then receive the cash into their bank account or physical money. Bitcoin is more expensive, carries a security risk, requires the Internet, requires a level of technical know-how and just isn't as convenient. I fail to see how it can improve upon the current infrastructure in the Dubai remittance market.

Contrary to a lot of posts here, I think this isn't terrible news. I wasn't expecting any update from them at all today. The update explains what has been going wrong, explains that they are waiting on Bitcoin core developers to approve the fix. They can't then give an accurate ETA.

After spending several months in Dubai (and other Emirates), I discovered that Bitcoin is not so useful. The banks are well setup for remittances and charge very little (some banks offer this service for free). Please note, I'm not talking about Western Union, but the UAE banking system itself that processes remittances.
So to my knowledge, there isn't really space for Bitcoin in the UAE remittance market as it's already cheap and convenient. To use Bitcoin would require a lot of education and inconvenice. It's all very well to consider only the sender (Bangladeshi migrant worker), but how about the receiver? His elderly Bangladeshi mother is far better served by the traditional banking system than 'bitcoin', assuming she even has access to an Internet connection. 
**EDIT:** Am being down voted as I am being realistic here, even if it's not what people want to hear. Migrant workers are unbanked because they don't require bank accounts (mortgages, loans, savings accounts). They work for cash and it's cheap and convenient for them to send cash home - what is the exact problem that Bitcoin can solve? Focus efforts elsewhere IMO.

I didn't say Bitcoin will fail due to Trezor or BFL. I said my experience with purchasing items with Bitcoin through the Internet has led me to favour other payment methods wherever possible. 
Sure, I've had many bad transactions when I've paid with Paypal and the majority of the time I've got a full refund. I don't have this level of protection with Bitcoin. Therefore, as a **consumer** with no financial incentive, it makes no sense for me to pick Bitcoin over Paypal *right now*. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:13:03
I got mine between $305  - $312. I bought some yesterday for $330 and sold a few later on at $455. Not much else I can do with the cash in there right now :) My original position was to hold USD, but after seeing all these updates and videos of Mark heading to work in the morning, I decided that it's worth the gamble to hold BTC... As it'll obviously double in price once they fix the withdrawal problem with everyone seeking to get BTC out. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:40:44
None of your points are relevant to your average, *Western consumer*.
I am not unbanked.
I don't care about CC costs - *I am a consumer*. 
I am not trying to do micro-transactions (&lt;$1). 
I'm not purchasing porn or something I'd rather remained anonymous. 
In conclusion, I still no see benefit in using Bitcoin over Paypal/CC as a consumer. I am pro-Bitcoin, but sometimes these arguments get a bit ridiculous. We need to be realistic about what is good and what is bad. Not to mention, I don't want to have to look up a website on 'Bitrated' in order to see how likely I am to be scammed. 
Credit cards give me the option to charge-back if I don't receive my goods. This also gives the vendor incentive to keep me happy as a customer.

From my understanding, employees in the restaurant business are paid roughly 4x as much as they would be in Asia, enjoyed health insurance and had very comfortable living quarters (I often stayed in the same accommodation as them).

The $10,000,000 is from *corporate accounts*, that will be liquidated and some of which will be returned to creditors, right? So why would I rather Sunlot get the $10,000,000 (and for WHAT exactly?) instead of myself and other creditors? Oh, and why exactly is the further 10% of *recovered assets* going to Sunlot as well? This is laughable. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:18:02

Such a bullshit article. 
So a guy checked into hospital **at 9am** Saturday morning in an 'agitated state'. No one died. No one was hurt. 
He most likely went out for a bit of a bender on Friday night, had a few pints, maybe a few lines and did a pill. By 9am, after dancing for hours, he was starting to feel like shit and probably couldn't sleep.
FWIW, if you check PillReports for 'Yellow Bitcoin', there are plenty of good reviews for them. It's a high dose however 200mg MDMA (+/- 20mg), so half is advised to begin with. 
I'd love to see how many people checked into hospital that night/morning due to **alcohol** related problems.

Valid points; I just feel people are expecting a decent level of customer service, which obviously isn't in Karpeles' DNA. Now, had the protesters NOT seen him casually strolling into work, then I'd been panicking. In short, MtGox has shitty business acumen, but I believe in their ability to fix this issue within 1-2 weeks. If I'm wrong, I'm probably way more fucked than the vast majority of people here.

No! I assume you haven't read the very useful explanations above. It's a double spending bug that seems exclusive to Bitcoin exchanges. The bug was brought to their attention several months ago.

Have spent a while living in Dubai and there are only a few large shopping malls and a population of just 2 million people. Not enough demand to justify anywhere near 400 ATMs right now. 
Edit: For those who are under the impression that Bitcoin is useful for migrant workers - Dubai already has plenty of **cheap remittance services**. The migrant workers generally do not use Western Union to send funds home, there are much cheaper methods available. Not to mention the huge impracticality of Bitcoin right now in this way.

As I've been saying for a while now, Bitcoin is **terrible** for purchasing with as you forego all consumer protection. If it were Paypal or CC, you'd have a trusted third-party that would mediate any problems (albeit for a 2-3% fee). 
Had I paid for my Trezor with Paypal, I'd have had my refund by now. Either that, or the company would be giving weekly updates, seeing as it's about 90 days overdue by now? However, as they are aware that no one can get their money back, they don't have to care about customer satisfaction so much.

He asks *"Why do people think we're evil? There's no evidence for this"* 
How about the fact that the initial 'proposal' had no intention of giving back the creditors 200,000 BTC ($100,000,000) and only **after** it leaked did they decide to pander to us little guys. I think that accurately describes the true intentions of Sunlot. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:29:26
In the interest of balance...
**MtGox has cost the community $500,000,000** 
Which inevitably has an impact on confidence. We also have a face-less Russian (?) exchange and a Slovenian exchange that has very recently been holding people's BTC if they don't provide details of their mining equipment (wtf!). Would trust neither with $XX,XXX worth of Bitcoin purchases. 
**'Institutional money' has been coming in for over a year now**
I'm not sure how much of an impact this had made on the price. Fortress have lost about $8m so far? 
**Bitcoin ATM's are just an extortionate way for someone to buy a small amount of Bitcoin**
It's not a big deal.

My guess is that MtGox has a less technically able team working on it and the problem may be larger for their specific trading engine. That doesn't mean that they have bad intentions or are purposely misleading everyone in order to cover up something however.

I believe in it long-term, just not so much anymore. I've been 'into' Bitcoin since 2011.

Sure, I learnt that Bitcoin is a sucky payment method in these types of transactions. Other people have learnt it when purchasing mining hardware. In these types of situations, CC or Paypal is a far better and safer option than Bitcoin.

So simply put, Sunlot will be using **$10,000,000** out of MtGox (read: creditors) funds to bankroll their 'investigation'. Then reward themselves with at least a **10% bounty** of anything they find.
We were told many times that Sunlot would pay for the investigations out of their own pocket AND nothing about this new 10% tax for the privilege. Oh, and what about our 200,000 BTC? Am I being overly negative here or is this really what they are proposing?

I think a lot of people are realising the same thing.

If we forego the massive leap of practicalities and assume that one day, the UAE construction companies decide to pay their Bangladeshi workers (who have no Internet access, by the way) their $200 monthly salary in Bitcoin, it still doesn't address the fact that grandma back home in some remote Bangladeshi village can't do much with a few digital bits of data. 
Oh wait, this is right? I mean. Yeah, Dubai will obviously be paying all construction wages in Bitcoin by 2016. Anyone who disagrees just doesn't understand the technology. To the moon!

200 million *regular* Twitter users. Twitter captures a lot of eyeballs for future revenue growth. Bitcoin has very few regular users comparatively. Bitcoin also doesn't 'make' money for anyone directly like Twitter does; it's not a company. Apples and oranges.

Last week was a perfect example of this NOT happening. China dropped significantly, causing the EU/US stock markets to fall 15%, back to 2012 levels. Meanwhile, gold went up for the first time in years and Bitcoin? Bitcoin dropped as worldwide equities dropped, and as gold went up. Bitcoin cannot therefore be compared to gold in this way.

He's a failed MP (politician representing a specific area of the UK) which is why he's now trying to become a London mayor. He partly failed because he threatened a local business over Twitter during his election campaign, essentially saying he will shut them down when he becomes an MP. Not so technologically savy.

Saying he wants to ban Jewish people from Israel from entering Bradford?

He said he wants to ban Jewish people from Israel from entering parts of the UK. He's an Islamist shitbag that has no support from anyone meaningful.

As a non-US citizen, who lost money in MtGox, this makes me pretty angry. Corrupt foreign intelligence agencies extorting international businesses. I only hope the US government won't try and cover it up, but they seem to always look out for their own.

If the rate is 22%, am I correct in thinking that this means anyone who had $1000, would get $220, whereas if you had 1 BTC, you'd get $106 ($483 x 0.22), despite the fact that bitcoin was still trading for over $700 on other exchanges at the time of the MtGox collapse, meaning it should be at least $154 per bitcoin ($700 x 0.22)?

I'd say most people in the UK support a reformed EU, if not leaving completely. The EU is falling apart IMO. Thank god we didn't join the Euro or we would be in a lot more trouble.

No, it's not newsworthy at all. She's not the first political candidate to accept bitcoin around the world or in the UK. Moreover, she couldn't really be lower on the political scale. It maybe would've been newsworthy in early 2014, not anymore I feel. We've moved beyond that. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:21:32
She's someone with an interest in Bitcoin that happens to be a politician (albeit, a minor one for a small fringe party). Yawn. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:51:22
One candidate from a fringe political party speaking well of bitcoin - not entirely newsworthy? Considering the fringe party itself (The Greens) don't even accept bitcoin payments for their membership. Move on.

I have $1800 still pending transfer. Am looking to take this further and disrupt Roman in any way possible. It seems he is choosing to ignore all of our attempts to contact him. If anyone has an address or contact details for any of his employees, family members or acquaintances, I'd be much obliged.

Looks like you've already broken the disclaimer? How different is a screenshot of the actual email (removing your address) from copying and pasting the contents?
