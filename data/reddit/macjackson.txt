Probably you are not aware of the fact, that producing an asic for Lyra2RE Algorithm, is very expensive and would cost you millions.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:57:40
Yes they switched b4 asics came out for scrypt-n.
Now they are using Lyra2REv2 which combines 5 different hash functions. Now to get rid of asics, if anyone was developed, VTC only needs to fork to a higher memory requirement.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:49:34
will it not be possible to bypass the BTC fee´s for opening and closing a channel by simply opening Litecoin channels and using atomic off chain swaps LTC -&gt; BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:59:14
The high price of ASICS, delivery times.. not a problem? Then What about ASIC Manufacturers? Would´nt a manufacturer be described as an idiot, if he would not use his whole Power to mine for him self at first, before selling and marketing his product?
You have to see how many pple use gaming PC´s all around the world. There´s the real potential when it comes to decentralisation
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:08:19
I think u are little short sighted.. sum1 spending millions to create an ASIC.. do you think he´s going to keep it secret just to be the only one who can mine with it? wheres the point? Financial disaster it would be.. No he will want to sell as much of them as possible. So he needs Marketing.. No secrets there
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:33:52
You didn´t get the point!
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:12:45
Yes.. BTC is dead. Mayb died 100 times so far. Shouldn't we do a rebrand? How about Bitghost?
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:03:16
Nope, atomic swaps will also work off chain
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:31:14
Consensus was there. everybody agreed. so again. how is it not decentralized?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:57:44
Sry, of course i mean Litecoin cash ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:41:27
ppl mining with gpu only agreed to change the algo to be asic resistant again.. that´s quite the opposite of what you are saying
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:57:29
what if the swaps are beeing executed by exchanges who are able to deliver the required liquidity?
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:17:47
and btw talking of centralisation.. not everyone can afford to buy Asics.. but GPU´s are very affordable. and further: how many Asic producers are out there? not very much i guess? what about dellivery times and playing with customers for profit purposes. what about Mining poools like btc.com, antpool, via btc who all support bcash but together own 45% of the BTC  hashrate?
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:33:12
Open a BTC channel and refund it at any time by doing off-chain atomic swaps from LTC to BTC through the LN ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:36:19
Or use LTC to open a channel and make atomic swaps to BTC 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:38:23
Ok pls explain: How is VTC not decentralized?
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:10:03
 starting Feb.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:22:34
erm yes but i use my gaming PC for doing much more things then only mining. I mean.. Asics are mining only and even this only to a certain point bc at some point your miner isn´t profitable no more.. becoming worthless..
look at how many ppl already have a gaming pc.. they just have to switch on their miner and earn some money. that´s also why this kind of mining is mor decentralized. everyone can do it!
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:32:43
You probably will be able to open a channel with LTC and make atomic swaps
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:20:05
talking bs! of course LN does fix the scaling problem!
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:40:21
check out 
BTC and VTC USD-Exchange
Planned: Q1 2018
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:07:44
No, he didn´t fork the blockchain. Litecoins blockchain has nothing to do with btc's chain.
So technically it´s not a fork
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:54:52
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:47:22
on chain fees are going to be much lower, since the LN takes a lot of load off from the blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:19:22
Waiting for 
They´re thinking about LN integration
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:16:13
Risks are simply too high. No one would risk it.
Hard to believe u can develop an asic for less then 1 million. Especialliy when the algo combines 5 different hash functions, it will get much more expensive
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:59:44
actually that´s good for LTC
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:39:27
Vertcoin's Lyra2REv2 algorithm is a mix of 5 different algorithms in a way, that´s why developing an asic for it will be incredibly difficult and expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:54:21
Just look at Vertcoin. An asic-resistant coin, for which an Asic has been produced already before.. This one has been forked away immediately. And any upcoming Asic will be forked away the same way. VTC´s algo in general is designed in a way, that makes it much more difficult and expansive to produce an Asic for.
So it simply doesn´t pay off for anyone to risk it.
Thats the way it could work out..
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:58:31
You lose
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:27:03
of course they did. VTC mining is much more decentralized then any other coin. GPU only means anyone with a gaming PC can mine it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:24:41
my understanding is, that you indeed need open channels on both chaines, but once you have a BTC channel, you dont need to close it aigain. Simply refund it by doing LTC atomic swaps. So you just need to open it once on the BTC chain.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:21:19
Why should you want to do this? Once you open a BTC payment channel, feel free to refund this channel at any time by simply opening payment channels on the LTC chain and do off-chain atomic swaps to BTC ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:04:23
You didn't get the point, although he says twice: "forks trying to confuse"? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:44:44
ok but you did read that my tx took less then 2 hours? or did u just ignore this part?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:01:08
It was not a segwit transaction
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:26:25
what i see here is someone who fears the gamechanging technology of the lightning network, which is soon to be ready and going to devalue a lot of altcoins, including yours..
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:57:55
If u dont believe, ill post the link here when at home
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:27:04
already replied to exactly the same question.. You have to read the comments my friend..
I could live very well with that, knowing that solutions are on the way.
It´s a price im willing to pay in order to keep the system decentralised. You can also choose to go with bcash.. lower fee´s yes but with 8mb blocks, how many ppl do you think will be able to download a fullnode to keep bcash decentralised? and btw.. why bcash when there is LTC, which also have very low fees..
Lightning network is comming and more and more ppl will switch to segwit addresses. You have to see the big picture! Don´t be short sighted
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:28:08
it´s not necessary at all. choose Litecoin instead and u´ll be fine. very low fee and lightning fast!
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:43:06

you act like an angry little kiddy :D
this must be you behind the scenes
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:12:56
Opening payment channels with BTC should be much more expensive then doing the same with LTC. If  your channel runs out of money, you could simply refund this channel with LTC atomic swaps. Just one use case.
Do you really think BTC alone can handle the amount of tx´s, if we go mainstream? I think no. So the last passage of your comment should come true in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:06:15
oh you are the kind of guy who buys high, sells low and blame BTC for it. Can we agree that you are a complete douchebag? :D
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:42:52
100% agreed
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:40:09
Right, i´m sure he´s talking about Tom Lee. Bobby Lee is Charlie Lee´s brother, who created LTC in 2011.  Never saw price predictions comming from Bobby before.
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:12:59
Talking about sidechains :-)
LTC is the perfect complement to BTC
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:13:13
so LTC too?
@_date: 2018-10-07 10:04:06
LTC actually is the perfect testnet for BTC. Tell me the incentive for an attacker to attack the BTC Testnet! You cant..
But for LTC there is an incentive to do so ;-)
LTC actually is not just a testnet, it´s much more then that. But DYOR pls
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:50:24
asking for LTC delisting? you have no f.. clue man

@_date: 2018-02-14 13:42:57
almost feeless. LN is already here. you just need to open your eyes to see it. read about it. still at beta-stage but adoption is happening Will be a completely game-changer
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:07:18
The chart is a few days old i guess.
Anyways, we went up 550% within a mutch to short time i think..
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:09:11
right, and 250% would still be more than all the ups  before
edit: So it's actually like going up 250% without even doing a correction
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:59:56
While in Austria you can buy BTC at every single post office since July 2017
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:28:46
You can call BCH Bcash, but you can´t call Bitcoin BTC Core, bc there is no coin that´s called BTC core.
Already brainwashed by Roger Ver.. too sad

1. this random person must be looking like Mcaffee, Charlie Lee,..

off-chain atomic swaps between BTC, LTC, VTC, SYS and other segwit coins through the lightning network
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:44:11
LTC has more than twice as many active adresses as bcash
LTC´s txs is twice the amount of bcash´s
LTC´s tading volume is 10 times higher than bcash´s
LTC´s mining reward is 1,5 times higher than bcash´s
anything else? oh LTC´s marketcap is only half as high as bcash?
weird thing.. should change soon ;-)
