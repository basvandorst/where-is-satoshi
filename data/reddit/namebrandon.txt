You mean this https? 
I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but for those concerned about privacy, https alone is not ever enough. TOR/VPN are very good ideas, as you mentioned.

I think you mean Blowstamp CEO.

No, but they track and collect so much of it, and it's been already demonstrated the NSA has decided to poke their heads in without Google even knowing about it.

Thank you.. this should be upvoted. Anyone can click 'translate' and get garbage, this takes time to do correctly. I appreciate the effort.

We need to keep track of these in the Wiki... Friendly banks, and asshole banks.

This just made my day.. Now I don't have look at the ripple/nxt/etc.. BS.

This is what I do.. Though I don't use dropbox, I use OwnCloud on a VPS.
Wallet -&gt; wallet encryption -&gt; truecrypt volume -&gt; OwnCloud.
This way the wallet is encrypted with two layers, and still easily accessible from multiple computers, without a company managing the back-end side of the cloud solution (unless you count the company hosting the VPS that runs OwnCloud).
pro-tip: symbolic link your wallet.dat from the application diretory to your mounted true-crypt volume. Then make sure to always close the coin program before un-mounting the truecrypt volume.

No, that's false. Quark was not pre-mined. It was wide open since day 1. The majority of it was mined very quickly (by design), but it was in no way a secret.

There's a reason for XBT, it's not just something someone came up with for the heck of it. 
BT* is reserved for the country of Bhutan. International currencies start with an X.

Wonder if there's campaign finance regulation that could be 'skirted' using bitcoin.. that might get them to change their tune right quick.
definitely not the 'right way(tm)' to solve some current political issues, but if it's possible, I doubt I'm the first to think of it.

a "clean start" means fair, open to anyone. Which QRK was. It was designed to be mined extremely quickly in the beginning to get the coins into circulation. Pre-mining, would imply initial mining was closed to the general public. That is not the case with QRK.
