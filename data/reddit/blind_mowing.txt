All you have to do is zoom out.

If you been around before 2017 you have heard this a million times.  Good luck though.

Show me the math.

The width of the descending triangle we fell from would put us at 4800.  I personally really don't like the charts right now.

You're a master trader, bro.  Keep doin what your doin.
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:57:03
Did you miss the part where I said, "if you already have a winning strategy keep doin what you're doing."?
Or did you come here to say the price could go lower?
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:58:37

YOLO guy tells the Dollar Cost guy he is stupid.  LOL.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:20:41
you totally can indiscriminately  buy weekly or monthly while it is under a certain price.  that price?  not for me to decide for you.
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:28:13
Yes.  Continue along with your strategy.
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:00:20
Nope.  My average is a lot lower than where we are at right now.

Are you saying people do not put money in their budget for investments?
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:00:29
alright, trader pro.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:05:51
if a DCA strategy depends on fluctuations over time for profit and not upward trends... tell me how that is not perfect for a Bitcoin strategy while it is not in an upward trend?
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:33:04
YOLO, bro!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:55:47
I'm sure you'll buy at the very bottom.
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:36:47
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:42:05
Not really that weird, but ok.

last couple days I've been putting a buy order at 10,900 and a sell order at 12,200.  Haven't even had to pay that much attention to it.

So much for white privilege.

fell below the wedge.  if you take the width of the wedge as a target price you're lookin at 4,800...  Bitcoin doesn't move like other markets, though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:52:02
I don't think you understand how anything works if you believe that.

Bitcoin bad.  Take this Credit Card... it's free money.
