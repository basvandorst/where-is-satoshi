You could also just burn your money.

Unless they invent a new method of propulsion to get there, $400k *might* be 1/10,000th of what they actually need. Sending a human being to Mars will cost billions of dollars. Of course, that's assuming you want them to actually land and live for any period of time. If you just want them to crash into the planet, you could probably do it for a couple hundred million. But why would you do that? 
I don't buy the "oh they're just naive" angle. They know that no bank will lend them the money they need. They know they can't raise it on Indiegogo or Kickstarter. They know that, even if they manage to produce this TV show and it's wildly successful, it's not going to make nearly enough money to fund the mission. They're con artists. Plain and simple. By 2025, they will have accomplished nothing but making off with people's money.

Sounds expensive.

SpaceX has actually put stuff into space before. The people behind Mars One have no technical expertise and are simply not capable of doing it.

It was literally the first sentence.

It won't. Unless you consider funding these guys' retirement something worthwhile.

Delta Vs are expensive. My point was that current methods are way too expensive for their budget.

The idea is they get a thousands of people to give them $25 to be on a list of "candidates" and then start an Indiegogo campaign to raise $400k. Then probably retire to a nonextraditional country.
