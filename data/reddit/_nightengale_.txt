I would be happy with $3-4k. It feels like there is no way it can happen as deep as we are into the bear trend, but I'm sure people said that about double digits, triple digits, and quadruple digits. So to make it to $4k after an ATH of $1200 probably isn't statistically that outlandish.

The majority of the BTC in existence are not "on the market". A sudden influx of this amt. of capital would have a dramatic impact on the price. Everyone has a different sell price, some will sell at $1k, some will sell at $2.5k, some at $10k, some won't sell for at least another year or two, some may never sell, some have lost the private keys to their coin altogether. I know China is big, but I think we can agree that there is probably more potential with institutional investors than the fringe, electronic-asset speculators in China.

How does one prove coins were lost? What would prevent someone from claiming that coins I have in cold storage are their "lost" coins? This would also seem to require some form of centralized trusted entity, which is sort of counter to Bitcoin's principles. RDD's proof of stake velocity is an interesting alternative, where coins that don't move are slowly reclaimed by the network (if I understand the proposal correctly). To keep all your coin, you'd just have to move it every once in a while, in essence to prove the private key is still know. Not sure it's practical to change to rules for BTC, such a mechanism might start reclaiming Satoshi's stash. It's all an interesting idea though.

Yes, but other coins don't have the market cap or network effect that Bitcoin has. Over time and with all of the alts coming out, I'm becoming more sympathetic to dilution arguments. I was open to bitshares and ethereum because they proposed things that the bitcoin protocol wasn't capable of, but sidechains sound like a pretty elegant solution to all of those issues. If sidechains are possible and can be implemented within a reasonable amount of time, the technology could solidify Bitcoin's position as *the* dominant cryptocurrency.

Hey, I started all this, shouldn't I be getting the tips?
Btw, am holding over one hundred coins, haven't bought since $140, and haven't sold a single coin for fiat ever, so your assumptions are 100% off. Just get really irritated that the markets are so easily influenced by "whales". Would have hoped this would have evolved into a discussion about liquidity and the size of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but we ended up here.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:44:35
Because Wall Street appears to be buying into Bitcoin cautiously. They have the fiat, the political influence, so they pretty much make the rules. If multiple Wall Street hedge operators, investors, venture capitalists, etc. are investing in Bitcoin, they're going to do everything they can to make sure Bitcoin doesn't lose. Those guys don't dabble at making money.

Not if fiat is held, and you quickly trade into and out of Bitcoin for money transfers. I believe this is going to be Bitreserve.org's model -- it makes  a lot of sense. And once enough volume is using Bitcoin for moving money, it will become a more acceptable store of value and prices will increase and stabilize.

MtGox has done tremendous amount to help BTC, when it was a fledgeling economic instrument. But BTC has grown up quite a bit and MtGox has done significant harm to the Bitcoin economy over the last 9 months, since about when they killed the rally up to $260.

I think this shift in their marketing is a brilliant move. The only potential pitfall I see is that by billing themselves as a bank, that may seem deceptive with Bitcoin's volatility. People can't expect to deposit fiat and have the same amount of fiat available from one week to the next. They need to market themselves as a "Bitcoin Bank", not just a "Bank".

You're right, it is a bit antagonistic. It was the first word to pop into my mind. In March, I asked Barry to do an AMA via Twitter, and he seemed very open to it saying that he just wanted to wait a couple of months for more to develop with his company's offerings. Every couple of months I've asked him about it again, and get zero response. So that irks me a little and probably influenced my choice of words. No one out there knows more about institutional money and bitcoin, and Barry is pretty tight lipped about what Barry knows. Maybe that's for the best, I can fully acknowledge that, but no one likes to be ignored.

His statement of something to the effect of "people want to see their balances in dollars" [paraphrased] struck me.

If a corporation wants to transfer the equivalent $50 mm to another corporation using the bitcoin network, they need to quickly acquire $50 mm worth of bitcoin. At the current market capitalization, that would have a tremendous effect on the price in the way of a short-term spike, and then probably a subsequent crash. It might work out for the corporation sending the money, if it was done quick enough they might even come out ahead in the spike, but that makes for more volatility than is healthy, even for bitcoin. With a much larger market cap and a higher unit price, moving that same amount of money without moving the market is much more feasible.

Have to get coins to the exchange to sell somehow, sending over the network way faster than writing down the private key and mailing it to the exchange.

Actually most of the bitcoin belongs to less than 1% of what might possibly be a new kind of super rich. Let's not pretend that the current distribution of bitcoin is equitable.

Strange experience: your assertion that, without a doubt, there is going to be another bubble just made me unexpectedly very angry. I mean I suddenly felt physically angry. How about we stop promising bubbles? How about we stop referencing sudden, obscene and incomprehensible wealth? How about we just concentrate on using bitcoin where we can, building bitcoin use cases when we're able and telling people about bitcoin when it solved a real problem, instead of telling them about it in the context of a ludicrous, pyramid-sounding, fantasy investment? The fact that this made it onto the front page of the subreddit so quickly, much less at all is frightening. Those expecting a bubble will be among the first to cash out in a panic during the next flash crash. So chill the fuck out.

They can call it whatever they want, but whether they are using the Bitcoin blockchain or not is the important thing. I tend to believe the predictions that if Bitcoin takes off, lower-case bitcoin will fade into the background. Not necessarily lose value, quite the opposite actually, but average people may not know or use the word "bitcoin" very frequently. Ask the average person what a URL or TCP is and see what they say.

Sounds feasible, but people are often irrational beings that even when armed with a specific knowledge, still may not process that knowledge of a future event until the event is upon them.

But even if the pond gets larger, a BTC is still a BTC, so the whales remain whales. Hmmmmm.

Because they were likely bullied as children and now are emotionally defensive. Children who are bullied often convince themselves they are much smarter than others to bolster their self esteem; that belief persists into adulthood and manifests itself as arrogance and stand-offish-ness. Sadly I speak from a little bit of experience here. They're probably most all good-hearted people who are just a bit awkward sometimes because of their defense mechanisms.

THANK-YOU. Kinda getting tired of all the circle and coinbase complaints.

Am curious why? I've used purse.io once and it was decent, but haven't tried brawker -- what do you like better about it?

Maybe he could consult on some of the keys holding NeoBee funds?

I appreciate the answer, but what does that look like? I can't just walk in there and give them a URL to Bitpay.

How many relaunches do they need? It seems like if they relaunched without the douche-baggery and had an honest, useful product offered at a reasonable price they wouldn't need all of the relaunching.

My order is a little further back in the queue and I'd thought I'd be mining by now, so I can only imagine how the Day 1/2 people feel. Who would have figured they'd do so well on the engineering side and so absolutely, miserably, horribly, terrible on the logistics side.

I don't know if it's realistic to expect every HW manufacturer not to take advantage of mass distribution channels. I think the manufacturer could implement some sort of sealed packaging that would provide an indication whether the contents had been tampered with.

Obscene prices.

You can almost make those charts do anything you want, I've seen the implied horizontal line run at a bunch of different angles. That said, yours provides some good perspective perhaps.

If the rate of BTC to USD is much higher than it is right now ($5k per BTC), it may still be sufficiently lucrative while keeping fees low.

I would respond that it's my f'ing money and none of their f'ing business. If they balk, bank elsewhere. That's too Orwellian.

The network is speeding up, but variance happens too.

I assume you're referring to Open Paper Wallet?
@_date: 2013-07-02 18:13:48
Your calculations assume that you received it today. Try again with a 3 or 4 month delay. There has also been several instances discussed on bitcointalk where Coinish's calculator has been shown to be error prone. It all depends on the difficulty and how much hashing power hits the network between now and when it ships.
@_date: 2013-08-08 03:03:12
And the ROI will be virtually 0 for either one.

With Bitcoin as a multinational currency, I think psychological barriers such as these matter less and less. The Chinese don't care about these or USD thresholds, just as I didn't care about the 1500 yuan threshold. Bullocks -- no barriers for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:59:24
Compelling figures. I've been looking at another set of calculations here where they present different rates of difficulty increase ( Jupiter and Saturn are offering two of the three highest hash rate values when compared to cost. Something seems awry with Coinish's difficulty prediction algorithm, because if KnC isn't profitable, then no one is profitable really... Anyone have any other thoughts?
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:43:47
That talking with his hands dude is **creepy**. Emphasis on the word creepy. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:30:58
This appears to be correct -- China may be into a bubble and the USD markets are resisting.

It's misleading, but justified in being misleading.

Also realized this assumes the exchange rate is always going to be $100... We shall see...

@_date: 2013-06-02 01:46:54
Unless I missed it, I didn't see that they're just selling faulty chips... But if they start shipping chips before they get through their backlog, that will be a dirty deal. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 13:52:06
Either KnC miner or just buy the bit coin
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:56:50
I don't think you could pick a gayer word than "squee". You will probably "squee" when your proctologist starts accepting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 16:00:24
The hype on them was over and the price no longer sustainable. I'm sure they sold a lot of them to people who may never get the value they paid back. If bitcoin shoots up to $500 at some point, profit is possible tho.

Had a feeling this may have been happening, when miner production lagged just as all of the pieces were seemingly in place... and then their promised donation suddenly appeared.

Butterfly Labs original round of miners were sold at slightly different hashrates and *significantly* different prices. For the benefit of those who bought early, you might add those as well.

Other than the insights offered by Tony Galeppi, most of the technical details you received were far from accurate. And, the activity in China, Europe and elsewhere is demonstrative that over-governmenting approach is going to kill us in the end.
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:00:21
For every day transactions, the speed of LTC is comforting. As for helping to ensure the diversity of the mining population, scrypt does have that advantage. It just feels like Bitcoin mining has been industrialized awfully quickly (i.e. AsicMiner owning 25% of the network hashrate). 
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:50:04
This has happened before I believe...

An 8-10 week lead time was pledged by the seller as a part of the purchase agreement. Delays with miners are more understandable. For raw chips, less so.
