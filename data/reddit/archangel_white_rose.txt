I was working at a real estate office couple years ago when bitcoins were trading for 150 a piece. There was a couple people I'd been talking to about bitcoins and when the price started doing its thing they all were like "see? Its a scam! This will never catch on!"

It's value never comes from people spending them but by what people are willing to buy them at.

YES! This is some of the BEST news I've heard about bitcoin so far! As long as the USA doesn't regard it as a currency we can treat it like a currency without them sticking their nose in it

What sequels? I live in perpetual denial that any sequels were made for the matrix. Or that any prequels were made for star wars...

Bitcoin is not really a currency though, if anything its a commodity closer related to stocks than currencies.

There was another shot of an orange food truck with a bitcoin logo, I think the guy was shouting see something about bitcoin accepted
