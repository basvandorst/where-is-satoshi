Maybe safest thing to do is download a known wallet from a known website after confirming the url is 100% correct.

well yea as much as possible when you are storing your backup, try and be as offline as possible. disconnect from the internet before attempting to copy or move backup files. it's better to play it safe than lose it all. you can store your backup (in any of these formats) on a USB drive or other kind of hard drive, or on a piece of paper (also known as a paper wallet).
