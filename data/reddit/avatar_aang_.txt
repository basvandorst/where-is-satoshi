Opinions are split but IMO you will need to be very lucky to turn a profit on litecoin if you start now.

How dare you try to regulate my magic internet money.

There's a lot of idiocy in the BTC community that you kind of have to sift through.

Yup that's why Middlecoin is good.  You don't have to worry about the alt coins at all.

All the ASICs will do is make it significantly less profitable to mine on anything less than an ASIC.

Unfortunately not, I'm using Phoenix and it's just saying "Failed to connect, retrying..."

It's 'nearly impossible' to buy with PayPal / a credit card because those transactions are reversible, BTC transactions are not.  So somebody could just initiate a chargeback after receiving the BTC.

This is just frustrating.  Face it people.  You got scammed.  It's your fault, not his that you fell for it.  Maybe people need to spend time playing Eve Online to learn to spot scams.

You might be able to find somebody on SourceOP but the problem is that in buying / selling TF2 items a certain level of trust is required.  Even though fees suck, if TF2WH wanted to scam people they would have done that a long time ago.

Just remember that unless these machines are normally turned on overnight, whoever pays the power bill will likely want you to pay for their usage.
It will only be worth it if they have somewhat recent ATI graphics chips.

Actually, now that I think about it, there's two parts to the equation.  While the changing difficulty will keep the supply in check (well, after 10-15k coins have been mined), the ASICs are insanely efficient.
I suspect that being able to mine 1 GH/s **per watt** will drive down the USD/BTC rate some.

dailybitcoins used to ok.  the standard payout was .001 but it was easy to get .01 with a few refreshes.  then they lowered the base to .0001.  and then to .00005.  it's just not worth it any more for 1/100 of a cent.

My thoughts are that the electricity cost to generate a coin will be 400-500x lower than the average mining rig.  This may or may not shift the supply curve to the right.

Wait a minute.... I'm a libertarian.  But I don't have nightmares about BTC.  Do I exist?  Any minute now, will I just disapp-----

To limit the supply of coins periodically the reward for finding a block cuts in half.  This geometric series converges at 21,000,000 which is the "cap" of BTC.

Defacing Wikipedia isn't going to help adoption.  The article states that a currency needs to be recognized by ISO before it can be added to that list.
Sure, bitcoin is the most valuable and well designed electronic currency.  But the line needs to be drawn somewhere -- you can convert Diablo gold to USD, should that be on the list?  Work towards more adoption of bitcoin.  That's what will get it on the list, not an edit war.

Dang.  He's got us.  How did *nobody* in the bitcoin community realize this was a potential issue????

No, the pizza cost 10,000 BTC.  Not $750,000.

Yeah it's kind of a shame how willfully ignorant some people are.  TL is using bitpay so they don't have to worry about price fluctuations at all.
