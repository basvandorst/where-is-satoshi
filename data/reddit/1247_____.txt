I'm beginning to think all the Classic hype is going to be XT 2.0: lame edition.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:46:16
I'm afraid that once we get the bandaid, work towards a real solution will slow.

bitcoins are divisible to a current precision of 0.00000001

The miners wont support Classic. It's antithetical to Core to betray the miners. Core should stay the course and watch Classic flounder in it's foolish, clumsy attempt for MOAR TRANSACTION

I am not a supporter of XT, but you are right on with your observations.

Increasing blocksize offers a linear increase in transaction bandwidth with the delta blocksize. Building a hierarchical settlement protocol on top of Bitcoin offers orders of magnitude of increase. This seems straightforward to me. If we were really in a major bad crunch for bandwidth NOW, maybe a small linear increase in blocksize (if reversable) could be a helpful band-aid... but there is no reason that we should expect the exact same payment network to handle buying gum as transferring the wealth of nations. If you can't handle complexity, software is the wrong field for you.

good point. let's hire Yellen.

in the end, forking should be hard to do. and be done only when necessary.

If you think tx fees funding the network is somehow a bait and switch, you weren't paying attention: The block reward approaches zero in the distant future. It always has. Block reward is not designed to permanently fund the mines. Fees have always been the ultimate incentive in the asymptotic future.
A 10,000 transaction mempool is within historical distribution. Time to confirmation is still within historical distribution.
People were sold the easy/cheap/fast transaction pitch because its true. You can send very large amounts of money very securely and with very low fees as a percentage of the total transaction value. However, anyone expecting free transactions faster than 10 minute blocks was mislead.

This is disappointing. A weak improvement in the protocol to provide a pathetic linear increase to transaction bandwidth. If we are going to start hard forking for such small gains in performance, what else will we be willing to hard fork for? Bitcoin should wait for an actual solution to this problem before inflating blocks all wimbly nimbly like a bunch of nervous children.

I think its because that's what they were sold: Early pumpers were trying to say bitcoin could do everything-- free transactions! instant performance! makes you a sandwich too! BUY TODAY!!!
They were obviously incorrect: bitcoin is what it is: a platform to build on-- 
I think a lot of us see the true potential of the network, but a lot of dumb money got in thinking this was the next paypal right out of the box... now they are getting crabby because no moon. Just because they are crabby doesn't mean anyone will listen to them. It doesn't make them right.

They'll keep their enviable position by making prudent development choices and not ceding the breath of acknowledgment to the mob which doesn't commit code.
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:34:12
people who commit code to core have only one charter: to commit code. they shouldn't have to run any sort of pr campaign, nor should they even feel obligated to frequent our little forum or have any sort of opinion with regard to it's moderation. the community of non-miners and non-node operators has it's own perogative to peddle whatever vitriol it may.

I think small blocks are good for network infrastructure independence. 1mb is on the verge (still large, perhaps) of being relayable in under 10minutes by long-haul radio or low-bandwidth mesh net. Via the network is the easiest way to attack bitcoin right now. Future scenarios where the internet decreases in bandwidth shouldn't be discounted. If we can find ways to make Bitcoin useful without leaning too heavily on "that which is given" we are more robust to situations when "that which was given" is taken away. I don't know if blocks are artificially small at 1mb... it seems like a nice even number to me... I would counter that they are artificially full due to low/no fee transactions-- 
Right now the fact that all transactions go through a single processing bottleneck is a large inefficiency. Large blocks don't address this at all: like I have said, if we really needed higher tx rate bandwidth NOW-- I could maybe support a (perhaps temporary) block size increase to keep the network running until a real solution is found-- But I just don't see the sky to be falling as many here seem to.

Whats the difference? they both involve changing fundamental constants in the protocol.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:15:54
nobody should/would support that. Classic will fail.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:19:59
wtf? why would anyone ever do anything good for Bitcoin without self-interest? This is free market cuz. Profit is a good thing.

I used to hold Gavin in high regard, but my opinion of him has been declining lately.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:17:03
lol classic can give everybody coins! free transactions and free coind for everyone yay! Stick a fork in it: it's done.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:04:33
existential risk to the network. eg.: sha256 is broken.

It would be fascinating-- the futures could be built of smart contracts.
