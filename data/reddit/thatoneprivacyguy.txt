There are affiliate links on the names of the services that pay them and are also pushed to the top.  Some more about affiliates and native advertising in the VPN industry [here](
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:29:51
Jurisdiction helps with the logs thing, but you can sort by each item on your list to see which service best meets your needs.  (Raw data is to the right)
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:47:47
Just a warning - the link above is an affiliate link, (the poster favors the companies that pay them above others)

The methodology is mirroring specs and features that can be found on each service's respective website (to be as unbiased as possible).  The simple comparison uses weighted values, which are derived in the [following way](

The raw data is to the right of the simple comparison, the algorithm that its using to derive that field can be found [here](

Mullvad is on the list...

I agree to a point, I see warrant canaries as a positive indicator of a company's dedication to the privacy of their users more than anything, but they're not all implemented the same, and it's pretty hotly debated as to their effectiveness / whether or not they're just marketing theater. 
However, there are several European countries in [the Fourteen Eyes]( so I would still be concerned about government interference.  Also even though some of those companies are not based in the US, they have servers that are, and users who are.
If you have any questions not covered in the FAQs, let me know and I'll be happy to answer them.
@_date: 2016-03-15 03:33:07
Thanks!  I'm just glad we got this kind of exposure.  My goal with all of this is to prevent people from getting hosed when they buy a VPN, so the more people who know about it, the better.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:07:33
Dealbreakers for me were if they log, require personal info, have a C or lower server rating, don't support OpenVPN, have fewer than 3 simultaneous connections.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:31:37
Heh, as stated before, I have no alts.   
I'm also not affiliated with in any way.
If you can find the cached version of my original post from December, someone from VikingVPN actually got in my face about my data.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:12:20
Thanks.  I went ahead and updated it, also I was tempted to leave it to encourage them to update their site.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:13:21
Probably so, yes.
My only other gripe was that they were a little more pricey than some others.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:55:51
There are direct download links in the FAQs with which you can do this!
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:38:06
THIS is why it's so important that my data be unbiased and independently verifiable.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:25:13
Thank you, if its not too late (unfamiliar with changetip) I'd request that you forward donations and tips to the EFF.
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:00:37
I'm working on getting it off soon, I agree.
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:08:36
It doesn't look like copy restrictions are on or anything.  Are you not able to save-as on the sheet?
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:39:25
I have tried IVPN, yes.  I would just make sure that their data looks good to you and for your needs.
@_date: 2016-03-15 04:33:15
Honestly, I'm still looking through some.  I've used 7-8, and there were some good ones.  I'm currently using (but don't necessarily endorse or recommend) AirVPN.
@_date: 2016-01-30 06:43:37
You bet!  I hope you guys find it useful!
@_date: 2016-01-31 02:45:40
Sadly, that's the short version of all of this : (
@_date: 2016-01-30 07:22:49
Thanks!  I hope people find it useful!
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:22:58
If the page is overloaded with views, Google will push out a version without formatting and notes, a refresh or two should get you in the real one.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:54:53
Fitting analogy.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:55:44
You're right, it's a giant conspiracy.
(Or I realized it was someone else representing VikingVPN)
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:39:40
If it meets your needs based on the data and it's working well for you, then I don't see why not!
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:47:16
I'm considering that actually.  Possibly in time.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:05:09
Depends on your needs!
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:11:06
Can you please link to an official source?  I'll be happy to update it if I can verify it.
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:01:03
Hey!  Glad to see people making use of my sheet!  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:03:33
I just checked the ProXPN website.  Under "proXPN VPN Service Details", it indicates 3 countries.  Can you point to something official that shows this?  If so, I will be happy to update it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:20:23
That's correct, there's a note on "Gibraltar" on the sheet explaining this as well.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:43:41
Depends on your needs, I guess.  I would download the sheet, sort by accepts bitcoin, and then go from there.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:07:19
I don't want to officially endorse anyone, but I've had good luck with IVPN.  They aren't perfect though.
BlackVPN and NordVPN are some other good ones I've tried since I started this little project.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:09:17
You COULD do that, and I'm sure some people do.  It would require a LOT of testing and so forth to see which ones would give an experience that isn't slow as molasses.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:03:50
Ah, it was him.  I remembered the flair, but not the name.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:43:59
They are frozen, but Google docs starts sending out a simplified version of the doc when it's getting a lot of views. A refresh or two should sort you out hopefully.
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:36:35
I just recorded whether or not a company accepted Bitcoin, other crypto currencies accepted by VPN services were pretty rare.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:42:53
The sheet is set as public viewable, so viewers don't require an account.  But yeah, I get it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 07:42:33
Added it just now, special for you!  (Although, they were lacking a lot of specifics)
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:53:59
Unfortunately, [they do ask for First Name/Last Name](
Edit: If you select a package and initiate checkout, you can see the required fields.
@_date: 2016-01-30 07:52:42
If you'd like to donate, please send it on to the EFF or another good cause!
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:50:07
If you want them to have some encouragement, I can change it back until it's official : )
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:10:13
Log into your drive, open the sheet, file -&gt; make a copy
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:40:07
They are frozen, but Google docs starts sending out a simplified version of the doc when it's getting a lot of views.  A refresh or two should sort you out hopefully.
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:14:34
There is one, but Google docs starts sending out a simplified version of the doc when it's getting a lot of views. A refresh or two should sort you out hopefully, if not, [here's]( a direct link.
@_date: 2016-01-30 07:14:31
I'm still looking believe it or not.  I've tried 6 so far, but each time have found something that breaks the deal for me.  I think I'm just picky though.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:08:54
I liked IVPN, but I was having a weird issue with server disconnects (which I wouldn't say typical).  I think they're probably one of the best based on the data though.
@_date: 2016-01-30 05:55:37
Thanks!  I hope people find it useful.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:57:18
I agree completely.  That's why in that header field, there is a note that says, "There are many causes and organizations one can support to defend privacy rights. Even though some companies may not financially support the EFF specifically, many still support good causes and are to be commended."
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:38:31
You're absolutely welcome!
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:44:16
If you hover your cursor over the relevant field, you should see the note.  If it's not showing up, you might need to refresh the page.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:52:38
Good enough for me.  Verified and updated!
@_date: 2016-05-01 05:33:05
Emulated console/handheld games probably.
@_date: 2016-05-09 12:59:17
Working on that.  In the meantime, you can download the libreoffice format (ods) version [here](
