Have you noticed for the last year or so, that 90% of this sub’s content is shitty memes from people that don’t understand the fundamentals of bitcoin

These aren’t mediocre levels...

I only disagree because this is a healthy market cycle for crypto. Might be volatile in the short term but in the long term it’s definitely going through predictable and healthy growth. That thought almost makes me glad to see BTC retracing and holding to lower levels :) because nobody could have dreamed 8k was low for BTC in 2017 or earlier!

When did you enter crypto?

Aren’t hashrate and cost inherently related?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:14:54
Yes it matters,because you can’t buy anything with bitcoin through your nonexistent wallet with Robinhood. No address to write to or anything. 
Remember why we’re here folks

I only have $750 invested into coin so it's just enough for me to care about analytics and such, and I'm ready to dive in full-fledged. 
@_date: 2019-12-21 23:46:38
I’ve realized my error of my ways and I am ashamed
But still I don’t think it’ll happen in 5 years
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:23:30
I think I'm going to just buy coin at the next low, i don't think a $10k rig would make the money back in a reasonable enough amount of time whereas purchasing coin I can see immediate profit.

It won’t be worth that much in such a short time frame. Would mean that BTC has to be worth $1,000,000 each, for a market cap of $21,000,000,000,000 (21 quadrillion) after all coins are mined. Or almost 250x more than the entire GDP of the world. It’s around 100x more money than all of the world’s resources created to date. It’s astronomical. For it to reach those prices in 5 years, or ever....I seriously doubt it
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:43:03
No it isn’t

They are different business models, and in different stages of their growth, despite being closely related in purpose. Plus, LTC did see a pre-halving bump, but it wasn’t sustained for whatever reason.

Just because something goes up constantly does not imply stability. Bitcoin is volatile, it doesn’t matter what the long term trend is.

It just cost me $0.04 to send $3000, both segwit wallets, so idk where this number is coming from

Let's work together to kill HODL and other words like it, so as to give outsiders looking in the feeling that this is more real. 
Every time I hear some news anchor (most recently John Oliver on Last Week Tonight) explain Bitcoin, they always mention these terminologies (HODL, FOMO, MOON, and for some reason REKT even though I've never heard it legitimately used), and it always comes off to me like Bitcoin investors are just shitposting fucks playing with internet money. We all know it's not true. 
Instead we should be portraying ourselves as a group of legit early adopters in an emerging market, using terms that sound serious. Just my two satoshis though.

I'm not saying it hasn't gotten 100x better. Just saying to report the numbers right. Don't spread false information. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:34:44
Highest priority like everyone else

Except you can't buy all the BTC you sold at 9200. Chances are you'll have to stagger your buy orders because the volume won't be there.
