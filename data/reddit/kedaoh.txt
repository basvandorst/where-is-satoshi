How did they select the people and businesses for the vote list, I wonder.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:07:09

Future of btc lies in Asia, for sure. It's a big market with big opportunities
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:34:25
What bitcoinjs is?

Well even good journalists need to plunge into the theme. Otherwise they'll make one shitty program after another.

Don't you think he has somebody who stand by him that's why he is still alive and not in prison 
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:58:36
Why are they downvoting you?
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:10:25
Yeah, write them a letter and watch who they ignore you
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:44:42

He seems to be a nice guy
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:55:45
Sounds hilarious. Plans... Nasdaq... under coin... let's wait until they implement this plan and then will talk
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:57:57
Haha! Best tweet ever! 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:24:09
I stopped explaining something about btc to my friends, they'd better read something by themselves
@_date: 2014-07-02 08:05:50
Nobody knows. Just because it's only a plan, maybe without a future
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:57:55
No doubt reddit searching system is bad and it's actually easy to ask here making a thread or find in Google 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:13:59
Oh right, Di Caprio is the best person to put here ;(
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:53:09
Hmm, almost all pages in there don't open. Pretty confusing. Try to fix something.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:13:25
I am so angry with Mark Karpeles actions! what a fuck is going on?  why the authority don't do anything? 
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:08:26
Is it a problem?
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:46:55
Always thought that if Satoshi burned 1 satoshi from one of his addresses the market would react positively.
He waits until everyone notices it, and then spends 1 satoshi.
Then he burns 2 satoshis, wait, and spends 2 satoshis.
Next day burns 4, wait, spents 4.
Keeps doing it until everyone is sure he is not going to dump all those coins in the market, just spend a few.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:08:59
Who cares about this issue?
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:57:42
We should act like it's interesting for us to listen
