This video explains it.  it sounds like he does believe it’s a good investment, but because of its riskiness he doesn’t want to be the reason people lose money. Respect for that.

Take it one step further. What is gold backed by? Nothing. A precious rock has value because people BELIEVE it has value. Simple as that. If people believe Bitcoin has value (which it seems more and more people are doing) then it’s worth something. Things don’t need to be backed by anything in order to have value. Never understood that argument.

This is the best response. The idea is that the volatility today will seem insignificant in the future. That is the hope at least. Buy right now and HODL.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:52:10
Where is this?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:05:55
Yes. It’s great if you’re just getting started or if you want to buy/sell in the short term. Very simple and easy to use. They may or may not allow transfers. I would do some research on that if I were you because it’s always nice to be able to send bitcoin to a wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:31:26
I’ll check it out! Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:32:15
In short: no one is 100% certain. All you can do is HODL. Don’t let the volatility scare you and force you to panic sell. Just hold on and see where it goes. Consensus is to only put in money you can afford to lose. If you do that you won’t have to worry about all of the speculation.

Interesting. Online it says: “Square Cash App is not a full wallet: You can't transfer Bitcoin to or from a wallet using the Cash app. You can buy Bitcoin and sell Bitcoin via the app, but it doesn't otherwise function as a wallet” 
I guess this is a new feature?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:07:50
I haven’t withdrawn on it before so I didn’t know that. I’m guessing you could just send your funds to another wallet and withdraw from there as a workaround? Or do all withdrawals require ID?

Bigger money in bitcoin just means bigger swings I suppose. Great way to bottom out again and get rid of all of the get-rich-quick types who don’t understand blockchain and are now panic selling. With a HODL mentality it’s kind of fun to see these crazy price swings. I’m not worried though
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:57:25
Yeah I just finished reading a post on this subreddit about that. Must be new. So cash app now supports a fully functioning wallet? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:02:32
Throughout the years, many people have regretted the price they bought bitcoin at. You can see tweets of people selling bitcoin when it was $11 because they thought they bought too high. This game is very volatile and you only get burned if you try to time the market. The idea is that years from now, the price swings we see today don’t matter. Who cares if you bought bitcoin at $12k or $13k if it’s worth $100k years from now? This video explains it well. Even if you bought at all of the highs in that video, you would be rich today. Stay calm and HODL.

@_date: 2019-06-28 20:16:48
Hmmm that’s odd. Hopefully you get it figured out. Only workaround to the ID issue I can think of is an ATM
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:40:32
If you want to make money in this game, you have to live with the volatility. You can watch it go up or watch it go down, but you have to remain calm and HODL. If you panic sell because the price decreases, you will lose money every time. Sit on it for a bit and don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. Good luck!

Do you have a link to it by chance?

A lot of people here may not agree but if you’re just now getting started Cash App is super simple and easy to use. Great way to dip your toes in the crypto space

Perhaps for a full blown crash we don’t have enough evidence. But compared to any other asset it’s the least correlated due to how volatile it is. Cryptos seem to follow their own tangent. But you’re right, who really knows?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:53:02
They are completely different. And you’re correct, it’s too early to tell if they have an inverse relationship, but bitcoin is most definitely an uncorrelated asset. An investment firm with a small stake in cryptos will have a much better looking portfolio during a crash than any firms purely in stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:49:44
Well I didn’t mean a full blown crash like in 2008. But anytime the stock market dips, cryptos have been unaffected. The whole uncorrelated asset idea is new but people are starting to figure it out. It’s only a matter of time before more institutional money starts pouring in
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:18:20
Absolutely. You want to have a small stake in it. It’s a great supplement to traditional stock investing.

Similar thing happened with Tesla in its early years. Top gear shit on it and multiple potential investors pulled out. Many people still criticize Tesla for being in the red but Elon doesn’t care about profits. He’s here to revolutionize the world. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:52:34
Who knows the exactly relationship between the two? But from what I’ve seen, when one of them starts to dip people flock to the other one. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:12:16
Compared to S&amp;P 500, US Bonds, Real Estate, Gold, Real Estate, Oil and the Emerging Market Currencies, Bitcoin consistently had the lowest correlation of any of them by far. So by comparison it’s definitely safe to say that it’s the least correlated of any other asset. And it’s volatility is what makes it so uncorrelated. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:00:29
And the worst part is, they still lost
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:55:50
Eh. I feel like a peak now is nothing compared to a peak later. I’ve seen it too many times. A crypto hits a new all time high, people cash out, the crypto crashes, people start buying it when it’s low, the price goes back up and eventually hits a new, even higher peak. Rinse and repeat. You just have to be in it for the long run and ride the volatility wave. HODL
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:05:37
I agree. Cryptos now seems to be very similar to the internet in the early 90s. But if you want to be profitable with them, you have to know when to get out. Most people lost money after the internet boom.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:10:50
Revolutionizing comes first. Profits second. There will be profits but it will be a little bit. Profits was not his selling point in anything that he does.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:12:28
Yeah try to find those. Here’s a link to an article arguing that bitcoin represents an entirely new asset class with their biggest point being that it is uncorrelated to any other assets 
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:59:10
Oh absolutely. Tesla and Spacex will be profitable in the future, but unlike most companies they will be in the red longer because he focuses more on what they can do rather than trying to turn a profit quicker for investors. And it’s working quite well.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:33:40
Wow. It’s almost like he knows exactly what he’s talking about. Great video!
