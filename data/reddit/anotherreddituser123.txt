Depends, if you looking for Euro transfers, [bitcoinmylife.com]( works for me.

It is more beneficial to first exchange USD to EUR by your bank, and then transfer it. The exchange costs of your bank and the transfer costs to a foreign Euro account are available at your bank, but I'll bet it will be much lower than 5%. Let me know the rates/costs if you find them, I'm very curious.

Due to fysical location (Europe) and regulations they have only Euro accounts available.
If you accept the exchange rate and fee accounted by your bank you can transfer USD to their EUR account.
There is a fair chance they will accept USD in the future.

Too bad you interpretated this as a you vs. me...
It's about the interpretation for a Bitcoin n00b.
With "Block Chain" I see questionmarks in their faces. 
I think we should rename "Block Chain" to "Public Ledger", it is the best matched expression, most people understand this and move on in the conversation/article.

BitcoinMyLife is independent from other sites and brand new.

The point I try to make is how to explain to a n00b what "Block Chain" is (in one word). The downvotes could be because (I think) the mismatch between the post and your reaction.

If we want Bitcoin to be successfull for everyone to use, it must be simple and not complex. What word (or two) would you use if you have to explain 'Blockchain' to all the (future) Bitcoin users at once? * very curious *
