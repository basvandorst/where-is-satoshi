dont worry about it, they can be broken down to 8 decimals currently and that can be changed if needed, the world could share one BTC, 21 million is an arbitrary number

I dont think you fully grasp what ripple is. Your first two bullet points are correct, however everything underneath them is untrue. Whats funny is ripple is an exchange and there is still a ripple exchange. Doesn't make much sense. I'm sure it will die if ripple makes it much farther than beta.

Thanks 4 the link. What are your thoughts on SD? From what I understand it is a money pit where the odds are stacked so you lose an average of 2 %. I have never used it for this reason, I'm also not much of a gambler. In a place like the internet it seems to me that it is so easy to call a company out on something like this -2% and possibly spook the gamblers. Then again this is human nature to take risks, and SD seems to be doing pretty well so far. What are your views on this dust transaction problem? How do you think it could affect the value of the company?

Dude, nobody buy or sell btc over paypal. It is far to easy to get scammed. Paypal can charge your money back and reverse the transaction, BTC transactions are final. If you use paypal to buy or sell btc you will get scammed. Who knows, OP might be a great trustworthy person, but there are many who are not and if you send you BTC you cant get them back

I get BTC through Mt. Gox, Coinbase, and trading the pumps on BTC-E, I am involved in Bitcoins because I love the idea of a decentralized currency. I think it would have been wise to stay on the gold standard, however I realize that we could not have done this and stayed competitive in the global economy. BTC however is a chance to change that. I guess you could say I'm in it to speculate as well. I do think that I will have a much greater buying power as bitcoins progress, but I dont plan on cashing out. I plan on using my BTC eventually.

So you lost more than half your life savings trading then? If you bought at 40, the price is 85 now, and your even, then you lost over half your money?

it is rising in value because mt gox, the largest btc trader, is going to start trading in them as well as NMC. this means a huge influx of money as noobs buy these two coins thinking they are getting in on the next bitcoin. this is ok though cause ltc and nmc holders get $$$$ and bitcoin price is temporarily stabilized by money going to other coins.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:23:08
Good, let those fucks who live and breath FOX news get in after btc has reached its market value and they will have less BTC to spend then all of us!

I don't work for them, I don't even have any XRP, I think people have the wrong conception about what it is. It's not a replacement for BTC, it's a decentralized exchange (exchange, not currency). When I say decentralized I am not talking about your wallet or the source code. I'm saying it does the same thing mt Gox does but on a peer to peer basis and without fee's. It has a form of currency which is used to participate in the system in a similar way that NMC is used to participate in the Namecoin system. This currency is in no way a replacement of BTC. As you say, the currency is centralized so it does not serve the same purpose.

So guys, thats not what they are reporting. They are just reporting that Bitfloor was shut down. Read the article, when you click on it the URL changes and there is no mention of BTC being shut down, only Bitfloor. Then they include an informing video on bitcoin.
TL/DR: They aren't reporting that, .........?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:56:20
It has relation to hashing and mining in the sense that there is a block reward which has a numeric value that will shift overtime in such a way as to create 21 million bitcoins. 
But if satoshi set the system up with half the total block reward then there would be 10,500,000 BTC and the system would function exactly the same.

I'm gonna let you in on a super secret trading tip, BUY LTC, once gox and other exchanges start accepting it it will spike, you get to walk away with 5-10 times as many BTC and you dont have to worry because LTC's dollar value is pretty stable with BTC

@_date: 2013-03-29 10:21:18
i dont have an account but to the best of my understanding it is a peer based credit system where money can be exchanged or transfered in the same border free manor as btc. currencies can be exchanged for other currencies including fiat and btc. there is a network currency specific to ripple but i am not exactly sure what this is worth/represents i guess most of these units of currency where gifted to a private company that will give the larger part of them out for free similarly to a bitcoin faucet, and will sell the rest to finance itself. that seems like a negative to me but it is open sourced which gives it more credibility. i am skeptical of it, probably cause i dont completely understand it and i think it might be a threat to btc which i have a stake in.  this is as much as i understand about the program.

I think this problem will be partially solved as the price increases and people cash out and spread there coins. Not everyone can afford a BTC right now and probably even less in the future. But think of a bitcoin as a million dollars. Few can hold a million dollars, many can hold a small portion of a million $

So I have a Ripple wallet that I opened when Beta was still open, however I have not put any XRP in it, or any other currency for that matter. I havent even gotten around to using it. I'm not sure what the withdrawal system looks like. That being said, Im sure you can withdraw BTC to your BTC wallet. Just as with Mt. Gox you can send BTC out of it to your own wallet.  
As far as USD or any other Fiat currency, If there is no withdrawal feature ripple wont get very far. Who would put money in that is impossible to withdraw right. Regardless it seems to me that ripple could act as a price stabilizing force for BTC.
If ripple takes off it would probably do this anyway, even if it doesnt work for your needs and you didn't use it. I'm not saying it would make BTC completely stable. I think BTC will have tons of volatility as it grows. I do believe that Ripple could counteract "pump n dumps" to an extent though.

yes you can still encrypt it, and you can ONLY encrypt different adresses separately. GO up to the top of your screen and select "encrypt wallet" from the settings drop down menu. Don't forget your passphrase or you will lose all your coins. It is best to pick a passphrase with 8 or more characters including capital and lowercase letters, as well as numbers, signs, and punctuation.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:57:49
let me clarify, I, my good sir, am thinking in terms of BTC, lets say you bought 1000 BTC at 40USD, you now have just under 500BTC.
you have the same amount of dollars, however you have spent the last month or so losing 500 coins

heeded father of ben, 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:35:37
Let me be clear, I don't like the centralized aspect of ripple. However I see it in the same way that I do any other exchange like Mt Gox or BTC-E, only Ripple decentralizes the exchange aspect. Yes if they are attacked and you are using them as a wallet for all your money that could be a problem, but if your using it to exchange different types of currency it seems to be a much more stabilizing force that is far less susceptible to market manipulation.

Your trading stupidity was offset by new money pouring into BTC. If you would have sat on your hands and done nothing you would have over 100% profits even after the crash. AKA double your life savings..... it's ok though not all is lost, just stop trading and start profiting.

great man, Im happy that there are honest people. As I pointed out in my original response "OP might be a great trustworthy person, but there are many who are not and if you send your BTC you cant get them back". Paypal is not accepted as a means of purchase by educated members of this community, and if it is used will lead to newcomers being scammed out of tens of millions, if not billions, of $$$$ while trying to convert them to BTC.
