Where did you get the address from?  Copy paste from somewhere?  Your address book?

You have a lot to learn, kid.

Poor people live paycheck to paycheck.

Who cares about that shithole?

There is no doubt in my mind that Bitcoin is currently undervalued.

I like .io way more than .cf.

I bet its going to be something dumb, like hugs or smiles.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:30:17
He's right.  You can't decapitate your head with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:26:45
I'm feeling tingly in my pants.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:59:13
Lol, I thought you were like 14.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:33:07
It doesn't mean that bubbles can't occur.

Mission accomplished. Thank you mods!

Then go learn before posting nonsense here.  You're making yourself look like a fool.  And you're giving Bitcoin a bad name.

Think of the tremendous amount of forces that push up against the downward pressure, resulting in an equilibrium at the current price.  
And think of the potential of bitcoin.
I have zero worries.
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:40:23
I would say it's definitely not bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:35:12
Let me go ask my buddy. He's from the future
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:32:09
Bitcoin is still EXTREMELY useful without the privacy benefits!
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:22:38
Because you haven't made it yet.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:36:49
See the smiley face at the end?
