Then why didn't you just hold???

The rest has been given to a charity of your choice, remember?

I dont really understand how they could lose money due to fraud, will you explain that to me please?
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:48:21
90% lost seems a little high.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:21:38
It take like two (business) days from the date they give you before it shows up in your account.

I've tried around 15 times. I never know the "what person do you know" question. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:36:01
to do this you must complete the level 2 verification tho, right? And I can't for the life of me get past that.

It works pretty well on my phone...
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:36:53

coinbase links to your bank account and credit card, if you want it to, so you can buy instantly (once you have been verified).

Is there a secret to getting past the second page of it? I know I answer them all correct aside from the "what person do you know" question, WTF is that?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:05:00
I hate how much I love that place.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:18:49
Thats what I was hoping for as well.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:49:52
ahh, I see, thanks.

I respect your opinion and all, but why did you subscribe to if your advice is to, "not use bitcoin"? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:01:17
So, basically, they fixed it for you? 
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:17:40
I understand and agree with that, but he did, in fact, advise against using bitcoins. His very first sentence is:

If you get to the second stage does that mean your address was correct? Or could it take you to the second page with an incorrect address?
