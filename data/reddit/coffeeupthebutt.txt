A company is not a person. They will not/should not get hurt feelings for being pressured. They should actually be grateful for getting the info on what their customers want. Pressure the fuck out of them I say especially with your dollar vote- don’t use them.

Dips make me happy. I mean going through the dip sucks, seeing all the FUD is hard but afterwords when it goes back up I feel like I’ve actually done something to earn the bitcoins. I’ve sweated a little and it feels like an accomplishment. I plan on hodling til btc is widely accepted as payment so I’m in it for the long haul. Looking at it this way helps me HODL just thought I’d share for anyone else who needs a little encouragement and maybe a stronger grip

Honestly curious.. why are you here? All your post indicate that you are against bitcoin. I am here because I’m interested in bitcoin and I have a little bit which also makes me interested in the price (probably a little more than I should be).

Get it to a segwit so it will be cheaper next time if fees are outrageously 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:27:23
I’ll try to answer this to the best of my knowledge.  Yes fees are high right now due to the massive adoption rate because people want to get into bitcoin right now even though it’s not completely usable as a peer to peer currency.  Bitcoin is a program run on a network of computers. These computers verify each and every transaction that happens on a “chain of transactions” or block chain. Right now a typical middle income American can run a full node(store every transaction that has occurred over the network) at the current cost of equipment and electricity. If we were to increase the processing power of these transactions(block size) then the people with the computers running the nodes would have to use better more expensive equipment and more electricity.  This would lower the amount of people processing transactions thus making the system more centralized to fewer computers. Bitcoin cannot be hacked. But it can’t be taken over if 51% of those computers were able to coordinate against it. We do not want to lose security by increasing the block size right now. As more people adopt it will become necessary to increase the block size but at that point more people will have a stake in bitcoin being decentralized and as such incentivized to run a full node even at a higher cost. Also solutions are being worked on to make transactions much much cheaper through second layer implementation. Anyways that’s my understanding of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:45:32
Lol he was right everything you have posted is just negativity towards bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:24:01
Sorry to hear your buddy invested at an ath. You seem to be attaching emotion to the investing/gambling that is bitcoin. Glad your here to spread caution to new people. I personally got in around 17k and I’m not sweating because I know what I signed up for. But I agree this is all new territory. I don’t think anyone on these message boards has the definite answers. I get agitated when I see people preaching like they know for a fact that it’s a scheme or bubble when they most likely don’t.Also from my experience and “research” I believe that bitcoin is going to be a major part of the economy in a few years which is why I HODL.

If that’s what you think then go with an alt man. We are the market. Bitcoin is probably going to be getting better with upcoming improvements but if it’s upsetting you this much you should probably just cut your losses and stop stressing over a “broken” coin

Bitcoin.com=bitcoin cash

r/bch = bitcoin cash
r/btc = bitcoin cash
The first three I don’t like but I can understand that they may believe them to be representing the “true bitcoin”. The last is ridiculous. It gave me a horrible first impression of bitcoin cash supporters it to be honest. It is deceptive and gives merit to the idea that bitcoin cash is simply trying to ride the btc coat tail.
Also people wanting to buy bth might buy btc thinking it is such after visiting the r/btc sub

I agree with this completely. I’m no economist but something seems fishy about the “economic stimulus” we have had since 2008. Bitcoin isn’t a currency quite yet but it is a great way to hedge your bets against inflation I think.

I’m sure the average person does not understand or care that much. It most likely will be adopted by larger companies that find value in a system that is not controlled by another single entity. With decentralization business can trust the transaction without the possibility of manipulation by single entities.

Well thanks for trying... Always curious as to people’s motivations for posting against ol bitcoin. Seems people just get their jollies out of it. If you want my opinion keep reading. 
 I truly believe some form of crypto is going to become a currency. Bitcoin is the strongest most decentralized right now with the best team behind it. I really think it is has the best chance at becoming if not a coffee buying currency then at least a store of value to hedge against the dollar. I am not an economist I only took a couple of courses but in my opinion we haven’t seen the effects of the stimulus package and all the money that’s being printed daily. I don’t think anyone here on these subreddits has definitive answers either way on whether bitcoin succeeds or fails. I’ve tried to read both sides arguments and haven’t seen anything that convinced me enough to sell. So I just simplify my reasons to one word -hodl. Thanks for your time

@_date: 2018-02-01 15:27:14
Yeah if there’s a simple manner in which it can be used then yes grandma can have her smart phone in her and walk into Amazon go store and have the app that uses bitcoin automatically detect what she puts in her cart and do the math for her and as she walks out it pays. Grandmas are using smart phones and credit cards. Also credit cards were scary too but tech adoption happens and 20 years is an ignorant assumption. I don’t pretend to KNOW when crypto will be widely used but in my opinion 20 Years is stupid long for a technology that is already being used as a currency and getting more user friendly by the month.

I think many people assume there has to be a bitcoin crypto currency apocalypse where all the sudden the dollar is not used anymore and the only currency is magic bitcoins. In my opinion there will be a transition period that will be helped along by current structures. Companies will hold bitcoin and process payments for other companies that want to “accept bitcoin”. This will further adoption in the short term by increasing the vendors for bitcoin holders to buy from. As the network grows the volatility decreases and the price stabilizes somewhat. It could also be possible that people might accept some price fluctuation as inherent to the thing.

I don’t think it’s ideal either but it does help people to use crypto currency to buy things. Adoption of the currency and helping with familiarity of how to use it is very beneficial in my opinion.

Is Chinese New Year a big event in the stock market or something? Why is it mentioned so often?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:50:01
Yeah doing the same for me 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:11:01
I honestly think there have been many shills of one sort or another in here and are coordinated. If you look at profile history they switch from ultra positive to ultra negative. Almost like they are trying to manipulate ...

Look at the tech. The number of dollars per bitcoin are just an indicator of public understanding in my eyes. Once it is more common/understood/accepted then is hodlers are going to the moon

Well duh

Lot of salt in here. Hodl harder boys
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:58:12
On hodl
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:25:43
I don’t know you but I don’t like you

Don’t back track. He needs to hear the truth. Keep up the good work comrade

People repeating the same thing does not a cult make. Yes we are convincing ourselves to Hodl through bad news. But for myself I got interested when the price blew up and then got really interested in the idea of deflationary currency. Yes it is like a sports team. We are humans we defend what we have stake in but I think if not most then a lot of us do watch the news and pay attention to events that could actually kill Bitcoin. And are aware that it may not work and that there is a possibility of failure and that yes it is GAMBLING to a certain degree. But I am interested and it’s fun and it’s going to change the world in my opinion so I Hodl (and spend and replace). 
I’m not the best grammarian either

Well yeah I guess every opinion and action taken by almost anyone can be considered “marketing and guesses”. I didn’t get the intention that the article was stated as cold hard facts to be taken to heart and to dump your savings. No need to dismiss it solely because it is opinion. But that’s my opinion and I’m just marketing I guess
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:44:36
That does seem expensive but it comes with benefits such as anonymity which I guess is why some would pay more?

But what about the bcash attack on the mempool?

When a major hack of the protocol itself happens- that is my “get out” sign other than that most everything else is just noise to me

I’ll hold til there’s a major event that actually effects bitcoin such as a hack of the program itself or similar news which I may be late on but until then the protocol is sound the developers are working on bettering the product and I’m happy to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:08
