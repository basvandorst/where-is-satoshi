If it proves to be an effective substitute for fiat  currencies , I am all for it .

Not only Trump, but the Democrats are anti-btc.  Democrats want to ban tech companies from issuing crypto currencies.

How about a double dip bit cone?

What about actual bitcoins that you can hold in your hand?  are they more valuable than the the ones  you have in a digital wallet?

A  word of advice from someone who has been through several bubbles , including real estate and precious metals .   Sell some of your position and take profits and enjoy the benefits of your wise decision.   Far too often , bubbles collapse.  Years ago I bought a lot silver @ $8-12 per ounce .  Should have sold some when the price hit $48 but I expected it to hit $100.   Still waiting.   I have a relative who put all of his saving ($25K ) into a penny stock and ran his investment up to $600K , on paper.  He thought it would eventually go to $60 million and he would quit retire at age 30.  Long story short:  the stock is back to a penny and he is still working.  He could have bought a house with the cash .  Instead he has a mortgage.  My point is sometimes you have to declare victory and enjoy it .

Can't cuddle with bitcoin.  No cute pictures either.

both .

Smart! Very, very smart!

Yes.   also exempting cryptos from cap gains tax probably means you can't claim cap losses either.   this is a double edged sword.   
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:59:27
That's different .  Now you may have a taxable event .  however, that is not what you said originally
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:16:33
BTC was supposed to be the new safe currency
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:25:38
Half a million a year?    
"Hey big spender,"
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:37:10
If you just bought and did not sell ,you don't have a taxable event and therefor don't owe taxes
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:42:03
because of all the predictions that bitcoin was going to the moon and would replace fiat currencies and that it was safer than other investments.  can't resist having a laugh.  
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:26:22
No , I made money because I sold near the top.
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:07:03
aren't you forgetting a few bumps along the way?
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:52:08
More bitcoin suckers get screwed.  glad I got out when I did.

Legitimate question :   Can I buy an actual metal bitcoin that I store in my safe instead of a digital wallet in the cloud?  what about bitcoins made from precious metals,  like gold , silver , platinum , palladium?
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:39:23
I'll believe that when my shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbert

the charts don't look good.  However, I have a suggestion that would make bitcoin a lot more accepptable and wide spread and at the same time solve the problem with Facebook and Twitter and personal data.  
Here's the plan.   Make sure you are sitting down and holding on to something.  Facebook and twitter and other social media platforms pay subscribers for signing up and using the platform and they pay them with bitcoin .   to be eligible you have to use it a minimum of 25 hours per month.   In return , Facebook , twitter and other platforms get to sell all of your personal data .   People could still use those services for free except that they would not get paid and personal data could not  get sold.   
I predict most current users would sign up for the paid option which would mean bitcoin would immediately be more widely distributed which in turn people would be looking for place tospendit which in turn would encourage   more businesses to accept it.   Slowly buy surely Bitcoin would become the Coin  of the Realm and replace fiat currency.     That's the idea . Any reactions?

what do you mean , WTF?

No I think I will just trade it.

Just asking.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:26
$10K is history .   The latest :  $10,484.13  (coin desk)
I really don't know what to make of this. I wonder about the implications of this.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:10:09
Join forces with several people who also want to invest in bitcoin.  Pool your financial resources . Have an agreement in writing about buying and selling..  together with others , you can still own 1 or more bitcoins   
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:51:27
Impressive !  thanks.  never saw anything like that.

Bought the dip.  Now it is sure to go down again
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:19:23
I notice Bitcoin has been dropping ever since I bought some.  I believe that my holding BTC is causing the price to fall .  going to hand on and see if I can drive the  price to zero
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:06:41
He is an interesting story
"Cryptocurrency thefts, scams hit $1.7 billion in 2018: report"  
this is why I avoid bitcoin completely now .  Made a few bucks trading some  bit coin stocks  when it was hot.  all done iwth it now.

this was funny but what was not funny was this statement by Old Yeller
"    "Let me state in the strongest possible terms that I agree" the U.S. federal debt trend is unsustainable, may hurt productivity, and living standards of Americans."
Should be a wake up callto everyone

Bitcoin:  the answer to the question of how to make a small fortune.  answer :  invest a large fortune in Bitcoin.

It sounded good like a digital version of gold but the promises were never fulfilled .   To all those who were multimillionaires and billionaires , learn from this.  You never go broke taking profits.
