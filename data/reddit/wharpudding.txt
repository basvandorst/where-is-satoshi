It can be duplicated millions of times with zero effort.  Are you saying the merchant should be paid millions of times for simply copying a file?  
Product not missing = no crime.  Not stealing.
Should people should actually be PUNISHED for having a copy of some zeroes and ones that didn't cost anything to make?  
If this person doesn't stop copying files for free, just what kind of violation of the NAP should be used against them in retaliation?

Posts like this make bitcoin sound like some Multi-Level Marketing or pyramid scheme.
"How can we get more people to invest so our investments go up in value?"!  
...or one of those "flip this house" hucksters.
"People are facing foreclosure in record numbers!  How can we profit from this?"
You might say you're doing it "for the health of bitcoin", but it just drips from your post that you're doing it for the health of your own investment and personal enrichment.
"We need to recruit some new members to the pyramid!  The value of our investments depends on it!"
You have no ideas to bring to the table of your own, and are hoping one of your uplinks or co-investors will give you some new ideas, sales pitches and possibly even leads to start working on to keep that pyramid growing.

Because it's *FUNNY*!  I get a huge sense of schadenfreude watching you sociopathic, anti-American Randroids trying to avoid (or even sink) the currency of your country.  I find it FUNNY when your crowd keeps ripping itself off, taking advantage of the very same things you keep touting as "security measures".  "It's anonymous!, oh wait, who is this guy who ripped me off?  Help!  Police!"  As I said, it's FUNNY AS HELL!
"There are people that are serious about bootstrapping a new virtual money transferring system / currency that could possibly change the world."
They're serious about it, but it won't happen.  Sorry, the libertarian "no-restrictions, no-country currency" gig isn't gonna fly.  But you keep on dreaming, little Galtian!  Keep buying those video cards!  ATI loves you!
"Comparing bitcoin to a video game fake currency?"
LOL.  It's worth even LESS than video game fake currencies.   "I have a lot of currency because I left my computer on for a REALLY REALLY long time!".  It's like an autistic kid working math problems on a chalkboard in an abandoned classroom and then demanding to be paid for solving them.  Just because it was done doesn't make it WORTH anything.
"What is wrong with asking to pay someone to fix a website for you?"
Because most programmers take cash, not WoW gold.  Same with doctors, lawyers and other professionals.  You're really not going to find any professionals worth their salt taking your WoW gold.  They want something with REAL value.  Not libertarian fairy-dust and Galtian dreams.
"You should be complaining about the thugs at Paypal who can freeze accounts and steal your money or the bankers who obviously have fucked up the entire country for everyone else."
Why?  I'm smart enough not to use them.  I'm not trying to make untraceable payments to Silk Road and have drugs mailed to me.  My transactions are just fine to send through a bank, with their protections in place.  
"...or the bankers who obviously have fucked up the entire country for everyone else."
Yeah, I'd like to see them swinging from street-lamps myself.  But trying to create a currency out of thin-air, backed by nothing but leaving your computer on for a really long time, ISN'T GOING TO DO IT.  And as horrible as the banks are, things like their FDIC protection STILL offer a HELL of a lot more protection than bitcoin does.
"But, no, you are here to fuck over those who put in their hard work for an open source project that does not even pay them for their work!"
I'm here to laugh my ass off at the frauds who think they can get rich by getting in on the ground-floor of this fairy-dust factory.  People with visions of rolling around in piles of bitcoins as they fork over the cash for 16 high-end video cards.  "I'll be rich! With no real work involved!  All I had to do was leave my computer on for a really long time!".  That and the obvious scammers and thieves that infest the forums, the contestant theft and frauds between bitcoin users, it's COMEDY for me!  "We don't need any laws in our currency system.  Oh wait!  I got ripped off!  POLICE!  POLICE!  Find a lawyer who takes bitcoins, I have thousands and thousands in bitcoin, but none of that evil fiat money!"
It's FUNNY!
"Bitcoin started off worthless!"
And it will wind up worthless.  Just like Beenz and Flooz.
"Obviously, your tone would be different if you 'got bitcoins for free.' "
No it wouldn't.  I"m not dumb enough to think that WoW gold is actually worth any more than your "not redeemable for cash" coupons for the grocery stores.

Your article says nothing at all about bitcoin, and appears to be about the Liberty Dollar.
"Article I, section 8, clause 5 of the United States Constitution delegates to Congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof. This power was delegated to Congress in order to establish and preserve a uniform standard of value and to insure a singular monetary system for all purchases and debts in the United States, public and private. Along with the power to coin money, Congress has the concurrent power to restrain the circulation of money which is not issued under its own authority in order to protect and preserve the constitutional currency for the benefit of all citizens of the nation. It is a violation of federal law for individuals, such as von NotHaus, or organizations, such as NORFED, to create private coin or currency systems to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States."
ZOMG!  Conspiracy!
"...IF...the feds hadn't already admitted they're trying to sabotage it."
They admitted no such thing.  The article didn't mention bitcoin *AT ALL*.  Though they do have a duty to eradicate competing currencies and punish those that try and implement one.  It's in the Constitution.

"For example a bunch of miners quit when the price dropped to $7 a couple of weeks ago. The difficulty lowered and it became easier to mine."
So, when a bunch of miners left, some numbers in a computer were changed and money was printed faster to save the value of the currency by enriching those who stayed loyal with more, but less valuable (took less effort to create), coins.

What are bitcoins? 
Bitcoins are the unit of currency of the Bitcoin system.
When we say that a currency is backed up by gold, we mean that there's a promise in place that you can exchange the currency for gold. In a sense, you could say that Bitcoin is "backed up" by the price tags of merchants – a price tag is a promise to exchange goods for a specified amount of currency. 
The maybe you might want to have someone re-write the FAQ and stop calling it one.  If this page was pulled up in a court so they could see the definition, it plainly says it's a currency.

No.  The ability to loan out more than their reserves is.

"Anyway, those 800 BTC certainly do exist..."
No, they don't.  They aren't available to the depositors anymore.  As far as they're concerned, their 1000 Beenz is now worth 200 Beenz.  At least until the debt is paid back.  
The "perceived" money supply you talk about is even more of a sham than the USD system you're complaining about.  
Why don't all of the bitcoin miners pool their money together in an exchange, and then have that exchange loan out 80% of the value of those coins.  It would make the "perceived" value of the bitcoin pool nearly double overnight!  
It's a big win for everyone!  Right?

It's still a hell of a lot more secure than your play money that you're printing out of nowhere "Ooh!  a block-chain!  That's backing for ya!".  It doesn't MATTER that nobody else can duplicate your WoW gold.  Your money is backed by ZERO.  And if you get bumped off the grid for any reason, you're completely screwed.  
Don't get me wrong, it's a clever idea, if you're trying to create ISK in a video game or something.  But this little WoW gold ponzi scheme is going to fall, and it's going to be funny as hell when it does.  (and it appears the smart ones are already bailing.  Value is down 2/3, hash rates are falling, exchanges are crashing).  Your Flooz/Beenz scam has about another year.  Cash out fast, and sell those video cards while they're still worth something.  
Oh hell, the Glenn Beck gold scam was more secure than what you loons are falling for.  At least you got sent something shiny when you gave up your "worthless dollars" for it.

Unless there's some way to permanently affix the appointed bitcoin to the physical object, this is dumb.
It's like buying a special "individualized serial number collectors pouch" for a dollar bill.  As soon as they're separated (or put into your digital wallet), this "pouch" becomes nothing more than a collectors item, and holds no value to anyone but a collector who bought it because it says "bitcoin" on it.
@_date: 2011-08-04 22:56:26
And really, does MtGox have enough cash on hand?  How about MyBitcoin?  Do those places have enough cash to take care of problems?  What about protection when dealing with theft?  Frauds? Any protection at all?
As anyone who spends a few minutes reading the bitcoin forums can tell you, obviously not!  And listening to libertarians trying to get the law involved in some of these fraud and thefts is hysterically funny.  The bitcoin forums provide for HOURS of hysterical reading, that's for sure.  The cognitive dissonance held by many of these economic anarchists who still like cops to protect them and their property (real AND WoW-gold) is really, really funny.  
Hopefully at some point libertarians will outgrow the teenage-angst filled drivel that fills the covers of Orson Scott Card and Ayn Rand books, and realize that they don't live in those worlds.  They'd be better off basing their lives around the teaching of Harry Potter instead of the writings of sociopaths, they'd be more pleasant to be around and able to be taken a bit more seriously.

Dunno, it sounds like they're starting to drop out.
The fact of the matter is that currently the price is so low (MtGox touched $6.01 this session) and the difficulty so high that if you have an inefficient card and high energy rates in your area, you are now operating at a loss. Mining for a loss was never in your plan, was it? So yeah, bitcoin mining accidents are currently happening EVERYWHERE. Shitfuckpissdamn!
At the time of this post, 4.89 blocks are being found on the average hour. That number is ‘supposed’ to be 6
It's continuing to drop as it becomes unprofitable.  You can say "not many have so far", but the evidence is showing otherwise.
But don't worry, the difficulty will be adjusted soon, so the remaining printing presses online will crank them coins out faster to make up for it.  The remaining miners will get more of them faster, for doing easier work.  Soon it'll be back to a few thousand miners making hundreds of bitcoins each day, and then it will be back to sending 10,000 to buy a pizza.
The only ones who will continue at those level of unprofitability the ones who are stealing power from their neighbors/relatives or places of work.
As long as people have to pay for power, burning it up to run the bitcoin network will remain unprofitable.
It's the death-spiral.  They'll wind up on the "neat idea, but no thanks" pile just like Beenz and Flooz soon.

That puts up barriers between casual users and easy adoption of the currency. It adds more hurdles and hassles that honestly aren't needed unless you're buying something illegally. It ensures that new users are pretty much locked out of buying from certain circles until they've "proven" themselves via numerous previous transactions.

Not going to happen.
Everything will still be priced in recognized currencies and converted to however many bitcoin it's worth on that day (or hour).  
Bitcoin is backed by even less than the fiat currencies that libertarians are always complaining about, which is why nobody is going to start pricing their goods in bitcoin values instead of what it costs in a REAL currency and then pay for it with however much WoW gold it takes to cover it.
You may be able to use it on your black-markets, but you'll still be dealing with "dollars worth" values and then counting out however many Beenz it takes to match up the value that day.

I didn't suggest that gold had no value, just that the prices that it was being sold at were ridiculously high, and were being sold at far, far above actual value.  It was a scam.  There are far better places to get gold than some someone trying to scare the shit out of the survivalists with doom and gloom stories.  The very type of people that so many of these bitcoin scammers are preying on.
A digital currency may catch on, but it won't be this one.  It's an interesting experiment to watch and learn from, but the blind faith of those throwing thousands of dollars into hardware and investment to try and get in on the top of the ponzi-scheme are really funny to watch.  It's sounding more like an Amway rally every day.
If it did catch on, the people at the top of this Ponzi-Forex scheme would absolutely clean up.  Everyone else dumping hundreds of bucks into video cards and power to try and earn their 10 cent payouts, not so much.  But it is funny to watch the justifications and listen to the howls as the scams clean out the gullible.  Nothing makes me laugh more than when a ripped-off libertarian starts threatening to get the law involved in matters.
Again, it's a neat experiment, but you'll make more money selling bit-swords on Diablo 3, and with a much smaller investment.

LOL, No they don't.  Nothing was "created".  There is no expansion of the money supply created by interest paid on a loan, it just gets shuffled in from somewhere else.
Money may have changed places, and the "bank" may have gained a few extra coins, but that came from someone else in the bitcoin supply, and 190 bitcoins won't magically appear in the supply because the loan got paid back, with interest.
"Anyone with Bitcoins can become a bank if they choose to."
Yup!  With ZERO accountability and chance of doing anything about it if they RIP YOU OFF.  It's happening all the time, and there is NOTHING that can be done about it.  It's one reason that bitcoin is seen as such a joke.
"You are proposing that the Miners simply become Banks."
LOL.  No, I'm not.  I'd suggest that someone invest in lithium mining before bitcoin mining.  I think bitcoins are dumb, and that anyone who plays as a bank should have to play by banker's rules and be held accountable to the same laws as other lending institutions.  ESPECIALLY if that "bitcoin bank" is lending out more than it's reserves.  If there's a run on GOX and they can't pay back all the coins they've lent out, then what?  Who gets sued?  Or do you just eat the loss?  (it's the latter, in case you weren't sure)
If anything, I'd advocate selling the extra video cards and investing in some hard currency (like precious metals) or something, not some WoW gold, which is created out of thin air, completely worthless without a computer, and backed by nothing except that "it can't be copied".
Bitcoin is backed by nothing but faith.  It has become a religion.  No, actually, it's become a cult.  And it's pretty funny to watch from the outside, honestly.
