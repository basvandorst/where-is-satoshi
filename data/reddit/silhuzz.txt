I have a question: what other developments are currently happening on Bitcoin core besides LN. I haven't seen any news in the last year since the whole scaling debates ended in nothing. A few years back I used to see small updates here and there. What are the Bitcoin core devs currently working on? Thanks!

From 3.9% to 2.9% based on your purchases.

Holy shit that game is still running?

How much is it to run a full node on aws? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:52:50
Was not aware of that subreddit.

I can confirm they have a nice selection of different ATMs in Singapore. Numoni is the most represented. We made a video comparing all the ATMs if anybody is interested.

So you parents didn't read what they were signing and it's the fault of the bank? Ok. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:28:40
Which country is that? :-) 
Probably Vienna ^_^

Nintendo is a great example of blue ocean strategy.

So when is Litecoin support coming? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:13:58
I'm surprised seeing this as my experience with a Lamassu was the best one out of all the ATMs I've tested. Maybe I got lucky that one day I was trying it out or the operators take the maintenance more seriously.

The Czech made ATM sells for as low as 2500 usd if you buy 3 and more. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:01:06
Ask them about Litecoin implementation. 
(inb4 for all the downvotes) 
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:32:51
It's for our travel fund. I think it's a cool idea. We wear it when we travel around and if people want they can support us. It's the same address as posted at the bottom of the YouTube video. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:49:13
Bull for LTC
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:17:19
Hah so I see someone else already posted my video :-D  thanks for that and as written in the YouTube comments sorry for the amateur quality its my first take on this kind of thing :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:12:41
Hi all! Me and my girlfriend traveled to Singapore from the Czech Republic to try out all of the different ATMs there, and do tourist stuff as well of course! This is an English voice over for my original Czech version so please forgive the amateur quality its a first one for me. If you have any questions go ahead and ask we will be happy to answer them :-)

Hi there! I was playing with the idea of buying a Lamassu for the Czech Republic as well since I had great experience with it while testing one in Singapore. I was wondering what would happen if the state required some form of authentication like an ID. Is there a way to add this as an add-on to the lamassu. Because AFAIK it does not have any ID scanner. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:22:05
Thanks for the explanation, its something that just immediately came to my mind. I imagined someone transacting in third world country without internet solely relying on his local blockchain broadcast which could be hijacked without the person having any means to verify it.

Just come over to Prague! The beer is cheap, women are good looking and meet ups happen here as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:40:40
a fedora to be precise.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:42:17
Yes, to the moon. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 16:51:02
Sorry it was expected to be English but is in Czech. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:18:05
It's actually good news! 
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:09:32
Wow, someone is really delusional here.
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:07:34
A tweeest! It has been a bank all along! 
@_date: 2014-07-13 06:54:44
Just a question: wouldn't it be possible for someone to broadcast a different blockchain than the original online? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:37:48
I'm sure I am not the only one seeing the obvious possibility that this I could be  the actual Satoshi that was found writing it. To get everyone of his back. Right?

No site yet. This was our first Bitcoin related travel. We have been to Hong Kong and China last year but they did not have any ATMs (BVMs) back then. We definitely want to do another trip as soon as our vacation days and budget allow. We were thinking about Tokyo but there are no ATMs as far as I know. Any suggestions where we should head up next? Anything you guys would like to see?
@_date: 2014-05-12 05:36:34
Slightly offtopic: I think it's pretty amazing how well they recovered economically in those couple years. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:22:35
I was wondering if I would be able to verify myself with my passport if needed because the ID slot seemed smaller. Is it for some kind of small ID cards? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:39:13
Thanks! We do have monthly meetups here! We are starting to have some smaller businesses accepting BTC like damejidlo which is a food delivery service, netbox which is a telcom operator and many smaller ones. It's also where trezor (  and coinmap.org is from. We are also about to get a Robocoin here so that's why i wanted to test it out in Singapore. Things are looking good :-) 
Edit: I would prefer the term Central Europe :) 
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:50:47
We get paid once a month here. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:47:00
Don't you say. I mean the actual process of a customer paying with his phone etc. I just have to read up on it somewhere. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:07:03
Before doing that I have to find some info how it would work etc. Not that I go there with "hurr take my coins now!" 
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:47:13
Offtopic: could anyone do an app to watch charts on G15 keyboard? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:29:49
Nice! Thanks for the tip! Might drop by and try it out! 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:53:23
Hah! Nice! Wonder if we will get it in Prague!
