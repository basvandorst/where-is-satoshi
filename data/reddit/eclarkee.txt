This marks the beginning of the end for Bitcoin....or Bitcoin Cash....WHO KNOWS?!

Was it an ATM that from your bank or an ATM not owned by your bank?
That's the difference. You're using someone else's network to get your money. 
I've been using a no-fee bank for years. Make your money work for you.

God forbid people send small amounts of coin! Clown.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:23
Because *insert coin here* is better than *insert coin here*.
Go to any sub-reddit dedicated to a coin, and they will tell you why their coin is better than the other shit coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:39:52


Yeah so just go ahead and delete this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:15:14


And this is were I believe you're wrong. Just because there is a ton of money invested into something, does not mean it's too big to fail.

I’d like to see BTC go to $1k. 
I’m also sadistic as fuck. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:15:08
Same idiot who bought at $1200
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:14:47
He's a freshman...how much information do you really think he understands about Bitcoin? It's really not an easy concept to grasp at first.
Also, adults have bills to pay. Sure it's only a $1 USD in this case, but adults lifestyles are completely different from a freshmans. They have much more to worry about than to try to discover some currency that could leave them broke.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:54:42
Hypocrisy? They confiscated the coins because it was used in serious crimes. What did you expect them to do? Give them back to the users?
Get real

Do you really think the Yakuza is really bothering with Bitcoins when they have a fuckload of actual cash already to deal with?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:02:13
Are you fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:39:06
Does it really matter which country they go to? 
Bitcoin isn't regulated. Is this technically theft if they can prove that?
Which government is going to bother with extradition on this topic?
This is a serious question FYI
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:30:26
I'm going to hijack your post just for a question of my own.
Why does MTGOX and BTC-E have completely different values of Bitcoin right now?
MtGOX = $420
BTC-e = $620
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:53:29
For someone who uses Bitcoin, do you not know how to use online banking?

I'm sure he's soooo scared of a bunch of nerds behind a computer and a total of 2 people protesting outside his office.

Joke or not, it's time for mods to sticky the Suicide Hotline again.
Edit - Downvotes or not, I don't give a shit but people had tons of their money in MTGox alone, don't ignore the problem.

Why didn't you just call your bank for all the information at once?
You're making it harder on yourself. The help is available and you're just finding a reason to complain.
30 minutes to do something that could have been done in 5 minutes...the horror!!!
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:44:33
So he kept Bitcoin?
Lol it’s a light joke don’t get too offended r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:57:00
I just recently bought $250 worth of Ethereum and spent $130 worth of Ethereum to buy a Ledger Nano S after reading reviews.
I'd rather spend the $130 instead of losing all my money to an exchange.
Also, it was pretty friggin cool to buy something with Crypto!
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:00:05
I definitely could have. But it's a little less convenient. If I'm going to be investing a couple thousand, then $100 to help protect my investment isn't an issue. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:49:44
So doesn’t that mean it’s just as good as BTC if it’s a copy?
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:36:52
Then take out your money and put it into bitcoin and stop crying.
And don’t come crying here when you lose all your bitcoin to a slip up.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:09:13
How come? And if it's because ethereum is going to rise in value, crypto won't be anything unless we actually start treating it like currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:48:10
Haha, yes I did. But they were questions as well. I really haven't been following since the days of MT.Gox and that fiasco. Seems a lot has changed since then.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:11:00
I haven't read about bitcoin in years, so this is all crazy to me.
I thought that one of the huge upsides of Bitcoin was that they had super low fees. Now, reading these forums, people seem to accept that there are high fees?
What's going on?
Edit - Damn! The replies to this were awesome. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 04:05:46
10% fee is not a big deal? 
Where the fuck do you people come up with this logic?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:26:48
You're right. It is just paper losses right now. It becomes actual losses when he sells.
But doesn't change much as his entire retirement fund is tied up and is at a massive paper loss right now.
Let's hope he doesn't need that money as an emergency any time soon because that's where he's fucked.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:05:41
This is exactly my thought.
This chart describes it perfectly.

I hate these type of "Working the rest of your life as a slave". A lot of scams use the exact same type of inspiration to draw people into their scheme.
We need to move away from those type of things if we want crypto to be serious.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:08:37
I'm thinking $2000
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:27:54
Lol this is a terrible post 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:18:58
Too bad that the word "believe" is just that.
The guy is stupid and he knows it. Bitcoin can go in 1 of 2 directions. Up or down.
If it goes down, there goes the guys entire retirement savings. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:27:54

Truth hurts.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:50:11
Zooming out of the chart makes it worse. You see the absolute crazy run up that makes no sense. 
Drawing a line makes it seem like it's going down to $2000

Transferring funds from one currency wallet to another is a loss of funds. 
You should have never bit off more than you can chew.

Naw I'm calling it crypto
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:22:51
I think fees are the least of your worries right now. The price is fluctuating by the second. 
I think if you do try and find somewhere else right now, you'll have to go through verification and all.

It is unlikely it goes to zero. But it's likely to crash and stay at a very low price.

I have 2 phones (Android and iPhone). One literally sits in my drawer and I use the other one for daily use. 
I have the Google Auth app on both devices. That way, if I lose my daily use device, I can start up the other device and still have the codes generated.
This, plus backing up my codes.

Buy in increments if you want to right now since Bitcoin is extremely volatile.
If you have $5000, buy $1K now, $1K in 12 hours, $1K in 24 hours, as an example.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:22:31

I've seen this skyrocket before.
I'm fearful.
Note: This is a personal opinion
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:58:14
I'm fairly new to bitcoin. Could you explain to me why a small transaction of bitcoin like this is a waste?

When you mean your laptop crashed? What do you mean?
You could possibly take out the HDD, hook it up via USB to your new computer. Granted, you didn't throw out the HDD or format it
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:00:33
Are you saying that bitcoin prioritize the largest sum of money to be actioned first? or Poloniex does?
Why should the amount of money matter? 
I understand the 48 hours over the weekend part though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:49:26
If an earlier adopter bought 100BTC back when it was, let's say $2, and now today, it's worth $150. 
They just turned $200 into $15,000. 99% of people are going to cash out. It has just turned into the stock market for them.
People see Bitcoin as a get rick quick scheme, not what it was meant for.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:21:28
I don't blame you one bit. I'd be lying if I was saying I'm not jealous. I'm actually surprised you held out to $200 and not sooner. If I was in the game earlier, I would have pulled out at $100. 
No one would ever turn down $2000, $10,000, or $35,000 if someone gave it to them. Any extra money helps in anyone life, bills, debt, etc.
Congratulations to you man, I really mean that.
