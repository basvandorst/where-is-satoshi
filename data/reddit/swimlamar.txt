This is true. You guys gamble on it, buy high and buy into hype (which is gambling) and sometimes lose. It's ridiculous how warped you guys are to believe bitcoin will ever actually be seen more than a quick buck to day traders and actually has validity.  
  


  
True. It's also funny that people say "omg but its liek decentralized", then people get fucked by hackings and it's insanely volatile. Because you need some form of centralization. Sorry, you just do in order for a currency to be stable. You need moderation, rules, regulation, and insurance in order for proper function. 
  


  
Bahahahaha.

There are people in the r/bitcoin community, a lot actually, who seriously believe bitcoin will replace fiat currency. It's insane. I mean the very article says bitcoin is a threat to banks and governments..... c'mon now. Coin used to buy shit on overstock and weed on the silkroad isn't going to destroy governments and banks.

uh.....  
  
bitcoin is horribly unstable.  
  
one of it's largest exchanges just failed miserably  
  
going from $1000 to $400 to $600 after that...all within 30 days makes for a joke of a "currency". It's gambling and its a fun way to make money and a lot of people do just that. Great for day trading, l-o-fucking-l if you believe it will one day be taken seriously. it will die within 10-20 years, as buffett said.
