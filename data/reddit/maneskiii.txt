Download Coinbase ( just to start with) or make an Coinbase pro and add your card or account buy bitcoin that easy bro
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:06:43
So Whst if it drops to 6k obviously buy more but jus keep hodl till it make those 30-100k numbers ?
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:55:03
Ahh yea I’m new but that’s my plan i bought at 8k and 7k definitely waiting for 10k range and you say you buy 500 a time ? Lucky you can I’m jus buying Lil 20$ that i can soare
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:06:48
I’m outside most of the day so i have to use my phone but why can’t i use Coinbase pro on my phone ?
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:36:36
Do you short sell or hodl till it’s goes up 
Example: it drops to 8k you but it goes up to 8,300 will you sell or hodl till it goes up more possibly like 8,500 ?
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:09:33
Ah i see and yea i jus started messing with bitcoin and have been checking my phone like every couple hours but your right i should jus wait till i get in and check or make an purchase
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:30:57
Yea but what If you sell at 10k then buy some more but gradually try to catch low sales you still win for the long run
@_date: 2019-09-28 01:30:24
Thinking of selling only some bitcoins when i do and keep some and buy more with the profits but your right would reward way more but if the price drops to 3k and i sold at ten bought at 8 it’s less. Loss and i can stock tf up on 3k I’m a Lil high so it’s looks better in my head but I’m def hodl
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:32:41
Thank you i jus mad an coinbase pro didn’t know it was An actual website thought it was an app
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:32:15
I definitely plan to keep some btc for the long run but why not short with all these dips get a lil profit and buy back some for the long run increasing it overtime while you wait
