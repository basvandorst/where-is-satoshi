Is this an issue? Especially for btc-e?
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:15:39
silly question but what's a recovery seed?
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:42:43
Yeah, seriously.
There is actually research that shows couples that can't communicate so well (language barriers) actually have happier relationships because you can't argue as much.
Sounds about right.

Which bank in Australia blocked payments to exchanges?
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:49:35
Which bank btw? I'm from Australia also

bro that sucks. i also lot about 4 btc worth on cryptsy.

I agree, I am simply saying, imagine if this played out on a larger scale. It would be in everybody's interest to have other major players as fall backs.

Was worth a try...

BTC confirmations take up to an hour sometimes.

Hey - love this. 
As an Australian - would be fantastic if you included AUD currency.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:34:17
Indeed - very interesting to spectate. I hold both LTC/BTC btw, heavier in the former obviously.

Is that what it's like in here? An educated mind should at least be able to entertain another idea without raising hell fire and pitchforks.

Have used bitxoin but they are reliable for large transactions, but expensive.

What if they were an overseas based exchange targeting the Chinese?
