I now have the excatly same setup, but fresh install of electrum. Now I just wait a week, if the btc disappears. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, if the attacker still has the same access as it had earlier.

It didn't have PIN, totally unencrypted. So it is possible, that someone snatched the phone in the bar or something. However I'm usually very careful of my phone, I wouldn't have an idea who could've done that.

You first choose the g2a payment method, after that you see bitcoin/bitpay. It is a little bit hidden. I've used it couple of times already and saved some dough.

Yeah, it was from play store, and was probably auto-updated several times. All my apps update themselves automatically.

Good to know... My phone was unrooted. However I had few suspicious apps on the phone, such as popcorn time. I guess if there were some 0day exploit, they could've gained access to the private key?

Possible, however I didn't notice it. I guess it takes 1-5 minutes to take the backup keys from the phone.

I have other wallets as well... I know how to store them properly, but this wallet I was just lazy/careless/etc. I just want to know what was the most probably method for the thief to get the keys.

G2A.com also accepts bitcoin, they sometimes have much lower prices than steam. However don't know about fallout.

Android version 6.0, android security patch level October 1, 2015
I already removed mycelium, so I don't know what version it was. I would guess it was the latest. I installed new mycelium to the same phone yesterday, and put some unencrypted bitcoins there. Now I'm waiting if they disappear - they haven't disappeared yet. (I know this sounds a little bit stupid, but I really want to know if my phone is compromised or not - perhaps I just should reinstall everything?)

Btw also have to add, that the mycelium installation in question was about 6 months old.

No.
