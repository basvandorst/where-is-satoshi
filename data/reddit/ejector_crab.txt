If I run a food truck, why would I accept bitcoin for a taco today, when that taco would be worth +20% in a month based on its bitcoin exchange rate? I would have to change my prices daily. If bitcoin is ever going to be widely adopted for point of sale, it needs to cease being an "investment." Otherwise, it's a currency with runaway inflation.

Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Why would I accept bitcoin today at ~$10k for my product, when I could get $12k / btc for it in a month? Beef prices aren't likely to change that dramatically, nor are tortilla prices. Too much volatility. I honestly don't understand how companies like Microsoft are in the game.
But yes, I think long-term it's a promising currency. How we bridge this current frothiness to that point is unclear to me, and I personally think a lot of people are gonna lose their shirts as a result, but that's my opinion.

Never suggested that. You said bitcoin doesn't offer gains or losses. I linked a chart suggesting otherwise. You still haven't reconciled the two.


Sure, maybe someday when this bubble we're in bursts. But maybe scroll through some of the memes in this sub. Tulips weren't a get rich quick scheme either, until people decided they should be.


A centralized market for investors to buy and sell shares in companies that produce goods and services. Those shares entitle the owner to any shares of profits distributed (dividends) and the assets of the company upon liquidation. The value of a stock can be calculated based on the actual balance sheet of a company. Sometimes the buying and selling of shares is divorced from the underlying fundamentals on that balance sheet. But in the end, the stock market corrects for those things (see: dotcom bust) and those stocks fall to appropriate levels.

Not in the slightest. Companies produce widgets. Other companies buy those widgets and produce widgets of greater value than the sum of their widget parts. Those combined widgets have tangible value that increase the size of the economy.
Bitcoin relies on more and more people buying to keep its price up. Not at all the same.

See my other comments. If you think bitcoin will keep going up, you would be a fool to buy in bitcoin. If you think bitcoin will go down, you would be a fool not to buy in bitcoin. Given bitcoin's demonstrated volatility, that's a pretty risky currency to make transaction in.

Please explain [this]( then.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:45:00
Yes, that's true, but I'm still selling tacos in a month. So I either take a loss, or I am constantly updating my prices to reflect the latest bitcoin exchange.

And if no one participates in the auto market and no one buys Fords, Ford has no value either. The difference between Apple, Ford, Exxon, Facebook, etc., and bitcoin is that those companies actually have a product, whether it's a gallon of gas, or a massive trove of user data that allows companies to target its sales to prospective buyers. Those all have value. 
Bitcoin relies on someone else being nearby, ready to buy more bitcoins. That's not creating any value whatsoever. It is the [greater fool theory]( in action. It may be a fine currency someday but it's a terrible store of value.

If the only thing driving bitcoin's growth in value is more users then, that's a ponzi scheme. At least facebook's value proposition is that it collects massive amounts of data and makes it available to advertisers. Without an underlying product or tangible asset, bitcoin's sole value proposition is its use as a decentralized currency, and that goes out the window if it can't provide a stable store of value that is not subject to extreme volatility.

Ok, thank you for answering my admitted ignorance. But you've raised another question: why would I ever buy a taco in bitcoins? They're (e: tacos, in case it is unclear) likely to be $10 in a month, but bitcoin is unlikely to stay that low, so why would I use bitcoins instead of cash?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:25:58
Sure we can agree on that. I see massive potential for blockchain.
But we're talking about $10k per bitcoin here, with institutional investors getting involved. I think we've moved beyond infancy, with potentially severe consequences ahead when things inevitably correct.

So, you would buy a taco in bitcoins instead of cash if you are economically irrational, because by doing so in today's volatile bitcoin climate, you're assuming that bitcoin will either stabilize or decline in value. Otherwise, you would be suffering the opportunity cost of any potential increases in bitcoin price by giving your bitcoin to the taco truck guy.
Thus, illustrating why bitcoin can be either a currency, or a speculative "investment," but surely not both at the same time.
