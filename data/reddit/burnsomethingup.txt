theymos, after having been contacted by a shady security researcher,  made an announcement thus sending the entirety of all the scumbags on bitcointalk on a mission to rob a website doing arbitration, all because theymos didn't like the guy operating it. Total cost of this to the users of site was IIRC somewhere in the 300BTC+ range.
Then, to make it even worse, months later MiningBuddy, stepped up and fucked over several people who wanted to help. Saying he would pay the users back, who were robbed and then just renigged, like it was nothing at all.
stringing everyone along maybe 6-7 months over all of this, then released all the private info to the web.
when it comes down to it, none of the prominent figures here are to be trusted at all, in fact most of them truly deserve to be in 3rd world prisons.

at a bank, credit union, money changers, etc.
I could go 5 miles and buy a kilo of cocaine, and it would be completely anon. with BTC, there is always someone watching you, puts a level of danger on you 100 times more.
BTW, you download and intall that cleint and every fucking intelligence agency on the planet now knows you are involved with bitcoin. it' a very focused way of finding certain types of people.
...I'm already on the lists, and they like me for some reason.
I've been helped way too many times to not know it.
btw, thanks guys :D

well, at least you are now in on the joke and it didn't cost you more.
I've been screwed over out of at least 13btc by at least 2 of the moderators of this very subreddit.

well, no one here can rob him now. so he never lost anything. 
most everyone here are just chasing unicorns and rainbows.

can i have some?
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:51:09
sure you can get that with btc, but, now you've broken a whole SLEW of laws, federal laws, especially interstate laws, maybe even conspiracy laws, that we both know we don't want to fuck with. 
say I get caught buying a kilo down the street, I go to state prison.
now say you get caught buying a kilo with BTC, now it's federal, plus you are even getting gouged way before this, and those charges stack because of how the kilo had to get to you.
either way, we're both fucked if we got caught, but not so much if I got caught using USD.
BTW, to any onloookers, this is only a conversation.

actually it's his gain, he didn't give anyone around here the chance to rob him.

that's the thing man, you'll come in with stars in your eyes and when you finally realize it, and you leave, it's with pure hatred.
Eventually all the old heads will be locked up and put in prison, but right now we can only work towards this.

he's a butt pirate.

If you want to help then yes of course, sell right now so you can buy at $30. So when they pump it back up with your hundreds of bitcoins you bought at $30, we can literally default mtgox. It's the only way we can pry off the control they have over bitcoin.

I don't, just so all of you can see what this really all about.
