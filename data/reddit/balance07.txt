Agree with no max on the protocol.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:40:50
No I can't spare nearly $60 USD.
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:07:48
Max $100 for some reason.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:04:50
in order to donate BTC, you have to provide your name. would providing another name be some sort of campaign finance fraud?
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:25:22
$100 it is then!

didn't realize that they provide the barcode on the website but not the mobile app.
which is stupid.

i just want Gyft to tell me somehow before i buy a store's card what the redemption procedure is. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:42:44
come hang out with us!
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:42:01
We do use it. Wherever we can.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:42:33
come hang out with us!
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:07:16
last time i checked into this (years ago), the rules were that the merchant could ask for ID, but if the customer refuses to provide ID, the merchant can't refuse the sale (presuming the card is signed and valid).
so they can ask, but not demand. at least back in 2010 or so.
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:28:09
if you're magician enough to get on reddit w/o internet access, you surely can somehow glean the current exchange rate.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:33:19
so, the only cards i have bought from gyft so far have been Amazon, Red Robin, and Home Depot, and all of those at least have the same problem: the redemption process is to have the cashier type in some long ass code.
it must have taken me 5 minutes to check out at Home Depot using two $25 gyft cards.
if the Starbucks cards are the same, then simply using them during morning rush is gonna piss off a lot of people (even though you're doing nothing wrong).
why the hell don't these gyft cards just have barcodes that the cashiers can scan? or maybe some of them do? how to tell before buying them?
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:54:53
Just use coinbase and accept that it takes a few days.

the Richmond Area Bitcoin Users Group had a special one-off meetup there last month. great times. we usually meet at Mekong, a great vietnamese restaurant + bar with great Belgian beer selection.
anyone else in Richmond or who passes thru, come check us out!
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:32:38
kinda defeats the purpose, no? i mean, i'm supposed to be able to do this all easily on my phone.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:14:15
additionally, the android gyft app crashes on me often.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:34:22
to be fair, there is pretty much ONE place in Richmond that accepts BTC, and that's this brewery.
so we're only one ahead of you :)

i don't disagree
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:35:47
It's to bad you are a dick about it, even though you are apparently right and I've been misunderstanding the issue, which seems to be quite common. I was operating under the "legal tender all debts blah blah" statement on paper dollars. Seems that just means that everyone must accept USD, regardless of form (paper, plastic, etc).
But you being a dick and not offering any actual backup info made me look it up. I was wrong but now I know. You're still a dick.

I can wait. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:46:23
well whether its a long number or a barcode should be something that Gyft knows and can warn us about.
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:59:16
they can legally make it clear beforehand that they don't accept cash. if they don't do that, i bet the cops would side with the customer, especially if they are offering reasonably denominated cash (not a $100 bill for a coffee, for example).
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:54:26
i mean, when i return something to Home Depot w/o a receipt, they give me store credit on a physical gift card, which has a barcode on the back that is scanned at checkout.
gyft is such a good idea on paper, but for me, the execution sucks so much that it just drives me to CC, even though i'm getting a new CC number because of home depot's data breach.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:02:46
Then just add a credit card and go thru their credit check to get level 2 verified, or whatever its called with whatever requirements. Then u get instant buy. Which IS pretty nice, indeed.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:08:56
yup, the Target gyft card provides a barcode. Home Depot gyft card does not.
i will take your advice and send an email to Gyft about this.

my dad still shits on Bitcoin as much as he shits on USD. he's a pretty hardcore silverbug (and a bit of gold), because metal is tangible.

Oh man, I just traded all my alts on btc-e back to BTC and moved it all to coinbase last week. Whew. Hope everyone else can get theirs.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:27:02
Gotta be smart to be a geek.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:22:15
good to know, i'll have to dig into the new rules sometime.
the reality, though, is that sometimes, i really wanna buy that thing, and the merchant is asking for ID and not following the rules. if i want the thing more than i don't want to show my ID, then out comes my ID.
gotta choose your battles sometimes.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:57:48
It's all about context.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:12:03
TIL that "now" actually means "soon".

in the Gyft app for android, on a Home Depot card, there is no barcode.

The advantage of coinbase is that you can actually get USD out of there. Good luck getting USD from gox.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:16:06
my recollection about Amazon and Red Robin may be wrong, or the interface may have changed since i used those quite a while ago. i can confirm 100% that on my up-to-date android app on my galaxy s3 that the home depot gyft cards DO NOT show a barcode, but the Target gyft cards DO show a barcode.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:13:45
yeah i can't get the Home Depot cards to update balance either. "unable to verify" or something. quite annoying.
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:18:17
feeling pretty good about my decision this morning to buy some (albeit a very small amount)...
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:03:12
good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:24:18
I think geek is the perfect word for thinkgeek. Stuff for intelligent people who are obsessed with stuff. It doesn't hurt that I consider myself a geek and not a nerd.
Personally, I'd love for the definitions of geek and nerd to swap, but I don't control such things :(
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:06:05
well with Amazon, i'm the cashier. i'm sure you knew what i meant.
not a matter of having home depot upgrade scanners, the gyft app doesn't provide one to scan.
i gather that this is just differences between the retailers. i'll try a Target one on my phone, because i would like to see a barcode in Gyft for once.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:38:42

Misleading title, OP. They encourage patrons to pay with card, they don't ban cash, as that would not be legal. If u want to pay with cash there, they just get a manager and a special bucket.
Edit: I am wrong about legality. See below.

@_date: 2017-09-04 22:44:37
I don't think this is true. If you buy $300 or more on Coinbase, it's a flat percentage (1.49% I believe), but if you buy less, the percentage is higher.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:06:18
do you always assume that everyone is heterosexual?
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:49:54
Correction: flat fee $2.99 for purchase $200 or less. Flat percentage 1.49% for purchases $200 or more.
I think they recently lowered this from $300.

@_date: 2017-07-30 21:01:19
Just transfer your BTC to a new wallet before spending any after the  fork and save the old wallet seed or keys or whatever for when and if u ever wanna transfer the BCC. At least that's my understanding. I read the Electrum text file announcement a few times.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:05:53
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:03:20
Yeah I've just been lazy. Which I can't justify for this much money.

I'm still gonna use them to buy, starting again later this week, but will immediately send to my PC electrum wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:24:42
... Electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:44:26
If you decide you want to use your BCC, you will be able to transfer them out of Electrum, if you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:46:46
The fees are much less than that.

After buying on coinbase, may I suggest transferring to blockchain.info for storage and use? Then xfer some to btc-e.com for exchanging with other cryptocoins :)

Did they change that recently? I had a $10/wk recurring buy for a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:15:10
aaaaaahhh my bad, then.
i apologize for assuming that everyone is American and uses coinbase.
i'm surprised that there aren't any UK exchanges. sorry to hear that it's harder for you guys over there.
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:49:49

@_date: 2013-11-08 03:59:29
Bit of a hike just for lunch.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:27:26
where do you do this? at coinbase, i tried a recurring $10/week buy, but it wouldn't let me because that is less than 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:57:35
I've found coinbase to be VERY easy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:54:55
if only there were a BIT tighter integration, so i could use it with amazon prime and my amazon cart.
just waiting for the day...

oh, went to your site. you charge equivalent $8 USD for your service. yeah no thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:00:31
Yeah get a wallet on blockchain.info, xfer some coin there for daily use.
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:01:05
Not difficult, just takes time. There is a difference. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:45:32
4 business days, but thats 6 days if it crosses a weekend, of course.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:50:22


that's a big IF


based on what? don't get me wrong, i'd love for this to happen so i could buy loads cheap, but it could do anything, include just level off. there was a quick correction over the weekend, but i certainly wouldn't call that a burst, and wouldn't call it that if it happened again, as it wasn't very big of a drop.
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:05:55
