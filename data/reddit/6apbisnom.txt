Yea I have a ledger wallet and it asked me if I wanted to keep bitcoin or swap it to BCash. I just kept it all as btc. I have bought a very small amount of BCash all the same along with a few other alts but it's probably a waste of time. I got a shit ton of dodgecoin just for the lols

I'm planning on taking out a student loan instead of selling some of my 3btc because I think the btc price is gonna keep rising.

I wanna go somewhere at new year's so the longer I wait the more expensive flights and hotel is getting. I'm hoping the price of btc rises faster than those lol
