Shorts aren't small positions, they have unbounded loss

Check out givewell.org if you want to give the most bang for your buck, charitably. They have made a mission out of that exact statement.

Yeah it's reached the point where most volume doesn't even know what a block is or proof of work or any of the technical info's. They see a graph and want to profit off the graph.

Because everyone has now seen the insane growth year over year and wants to get rich.
Make no mistake, this is due to a FOMO frenzy

They both describe themselves as bets of course you can.

Jesus dude, some people are altruistic, why the disdain?

People who just heard of Bitcoin and saw its growrh curve are buying either out of FOMO or to gamble on the upswing before the crash.
A bunch of folks who think speculative buying of Bitcoin is their ticket to riches

Is there a system where less money = more gains?
EDIT: fixed

Don't short 
I also think there's a crash coming, but shorting has infinite downside. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent

givewell.org is a nonprofit determined to find effective charities and they put large amounts of research into proving their effectiveness. The red cross may not be effective but that doesn't mean there is no such thing as an effective charity.

It's not wealth until you spend the coins or cash out into Fiat. Everyone can't do the latter, and nobody will do the former while it is deflatioanary.
This is a lot of wealth on paper, but unless you turn into into a less volatile asset it could cease to become meaningful.

You still make more money in a progressive system the more money you have. Your taxes go up but not to a point where you're disincentivized to work
