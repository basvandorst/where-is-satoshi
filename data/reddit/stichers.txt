Yes, I called them and explained what was happening, and the person I spoke to told me how to file the complaint. Give them a call. Good luck.

Thank you for posting this. I wired money to them on June 20, and they have not credited it to my account and have not responded to any of my emails or phone calls. I filed a report with DFSNY yesterday, I'm hoping that will get me somewhere. 
Regardless of all the positive reviews elsewhere, for my experience this company has horrible customer service at best; they're complete scam artists at worst. I'll be closing my account as soon as my funds are returned. 
UPDATE: Gemini finally credited my wired funds to my account. It only took a week, which is better than what some have been experiencing. I emailed them daily, called twice, messaged them through Facebook and posted on their page, and I filed a complaint with NYDFS. I pulled my funds from Gemini today (fingers crossed that the wire back to my bank goes through!), not going to deal with them again. I would have been a lot more patient and understanding if I'd received any communication from them, especially if it was apologetic and contained an explanation for the delay. But that's not how they do things apparently.

I am having the same problem - I wired money on Wednesday AM, and they emailed me that night saying the name on my account did not exactly match the one on my application. So I sent them the correct info and now nothing. I've emailed several times and they are not responding. I know they received the money, they just aren't letting me have access to it. Now I'm worried that this is just the beginning of my battle. I've had my account with them for about a week, so to say I'm unimpressed at this point is an understatement.
