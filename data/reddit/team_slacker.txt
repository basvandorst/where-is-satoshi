This is pretty cool. Will download and run it. Like the idea of incentivising to increase your data pool.

Yo dawg, I heard you like bits, so I put some Bits in your Bitcoin and now you can X-B-T while you B-T-C.

I've been noticing a lot more people being generous with changetip recently.  It's good for the community and helps not scare away the noobs :-)

Huzzah :-)

Dogecoin got me interested in cryptocurrencies.  By the time I heard about Bitcoin, it was already too intimidating to get into.  Getting involved in makes all cryptos more approachable.  Not that  I've ventured into Bitcoin or Litecoin anymore than to read up on them.  What's good for one is good for all at this point.  Rising tide and boats and whatnot.

I've got a Ford Focus in upstate NY that needs a new transmission.  $500 in BTC and it's yours.

Just had a rebuilt one put in a Fusion that I have for about $3k, so I'd expect it to be in that neighborhood.  Although you could probably get it done quite a bit cheaper with a used (not rebuilt) one and if you did the work yourself.

Sorry they sucked you in.  Just glad I got out after noticing the whitewashing of anything negative that was said about their Scrypt miners.  Their rabbit hole has gotten so much deeper since those days.

Awesome, thanks!

What an awesome post! :-)

The only reason they're accepting Bitcoin is because of the Josh Wise Dogecoin sponsorship.

Would gladly tell my coworkers if I wouldn't get mocked for the site not actually working at the moment.  ETA on being back up?

Provident Metals sponsored NASCAR driver Josh Wise because of his Dogecoin sponsorship. The Wise connection is also why they accept crypto at all. They're also selling a community - designed 1 oz silver Dogecoin coin, if you're into that.
