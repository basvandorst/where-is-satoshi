I have friends, family and colleagues that sort of smirk whenever I say something about BTC or Crypto so all I say now from time to time is "Buy some Bitcoin" that's it and then talk about something else.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:14:35
Yes this is a scam.
I wish you luck with BTC and Crypto if you have to come here and ask. This is so obvious. Follow the right channels and keep educating yourself��

People that know very little about crypto constantly try to school me about the energy it costs, volatility, bubble and criminal activity.
Most are just scared cause they don't know how to get into BTC or Crypto so they bash it instead plus they're scared that they might be wrong and should have given it more attention so they're very vocal hoping others around them will stop looking in to the subject so that when BTC does go through the roof at least they're not the only ones missing out.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:23:51
They're really scawd now.

@_date: 2019-11-29 12:05:38
Pretty sure that, in the not to far distance, you don't need to be very tech savvy to buy/own/use BTC, and still don't need a third party.
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:24:18
The worse has already happened.
You assuming that a stay at home mom has all the free time........ BOOM!

Watch some of his videos on YouTube.
There are quite a few where in between he sort of sums up what Bitcoin is in a few sentences.

@_date: 2019-03-28 20:02:33
Awesome. I also have a goal of owning BTC 1,0 soon.
Have bought BTC often to be able to buy other coins/tokens and then i read some more about BTC and set this goal of owning a whole one.
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:23:41
Anybody got a link to the story under number 2 (threw away harddrive)?
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:49:59
I am indeed
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:11:38
Wise choice to cash in some of your BTC but I think you over estimate the importance of a private elite school education.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:36:53
1 Ditch the mining dream.
2 Stop lamenting about "missing out'
3 Don't buy Bitcoin, start buying Satoshis instead.

15-20 Will cause opposers/doubters to get really vocal and negative (albeit nervous that they might be wrong but too vain to admit it and actually buy some) and declare another giant fall back just like 2018
20-30 They pretend to still not care, but they actually think that by now it's not worth the risk anymore thinking 40-50 will be the top,so they continue to shout that the bubble will burst any time
30+ Will silence most and have the others looking for excuses as to why the didn't get some.
Now I'm not patting myself on the shoulder but I'm glad I actually dove in to the world of crypto and spend 2018 up untill either working or reading about BTC/Crypto and preparing myself for the ride.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:32:13
Almost 75% of the electricity used for mining BTC comes from renewable energy

How very cool
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:03:51
You do realise that around 1 billion people in the world make less than $1 a day.
You're telling me they should have bought some BTC?
Oh and don't get me started on Mr Zuckerberg

After 99.999.999 Satoshis 
However I call 1.000.000 Satoshis 1 Bitcoin cent.
Or is this not what you meant?
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:16:43
You realise that the very rich will probably find a way to profit from a crisis and the people that are already poor will suffer greatly.
What an awful thing to wish for.
Many of us lucky enough to even have the time to spend learning about crypto and are even more lucky to be able to have spare money to acquire some.
Are you seriously going to wish for poor people's life to become even more miserable than it already is.
You going tell them "should have gotten some Bitcoin"?
I seriously hope that if fortune falls upon a whole new group of people that at least we all try and do things differently than the many of the fortunate ones in the fiat controlled world are doing right now.
I hope we'll look after the underprivileged and use our sats to right the wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-02 11:09:15
Your not giving a fuck combined with your AR-15 comment is pretty worrisome.

How did they confiscate his BTC?
Not sure I believe this story

Fuck Banks(y)?

Congrats! Will keep on buying small amounts whenever I can.
@_date: 2019-04-18 08:20:54
Yeah I'm feeling this
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:36:18
My advice.
Hold BTC 1 just I case.

I made my first BTC ATM purchase here a while back.
Got in to crypto in October 2017 and I felt that I had to at least buy BTC from an ATM once.
An experience I'll never forget.

As a merchant you get to keep a part of the transaction costs.
Also customers can buy BTC, LTC, BNB and NPXS through your XPOS device

So cool
Show this to some youngsters, this will appeal to them.

Radical? You have any idea what they're demonstrating for?
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:00:16
Wouldn't trust ING with crypto. Talking about regulating and trust while they're  building a fortune helping criminals with money laundering. Getting fined for fraudulent behaviour over and over again.
Haha, crooks, what a freaking joke.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:01:39
If you can spare the cash then hold on to the BTC.
Might turn out to be the best gift you've ever received.
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:21:39
@_date: 2019-09-15 06:35:43
Great idea for a book.
Would be cool if the illustrators were getting a percentage of every eBook sold, I actually hope that is the case?
What I sensed from the article is that the author is bragging about how 2 people worked for 3 months for €1000 total which gives them a salary of $166 per month each and isn't that what many thought was wrong with the "old world" pre decentralisation? Decentralisation is about fairness giving the power back to the people by eliminating the need of a third party.
Now the author can bypass a publisher which is great, and the whole point, and so he gets 100% of the revenue .
Now if the author is in full control of revenue and not share some of the profit with the illustrators then yes he has taken out the third party but subsequently adapts the very mentality of a third party which we many pioneers land adapters decided was not cool.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:46:55
Bet you had to look that up.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:06:38
�� and yes you'll be fine.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:50:17
There are prepaid crypto gift cards available already and payment cards that you transfer crypto to and and from.
Some are even eligible for airdrops and interest that is automatically added on to your card.
Could be developed for BTC as well I'd think.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:32:02
Ok, thanks. Yeah that would be nice.

@_date: 2019-05-13 16:04:27
Whatever is convenient for you.
I got some at an ATM when BTC was at around 3.5k.
Paid 5% for the experience. Totally worth it.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:57:14
They just have to make sure to clean the touch screens.
Like this the machine looks cheap.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:23:54
So green is up and red is down?
