What's concerning is that it has become a store of value because of the fees! It can still be, but it could be both if the technology allowed it to be. Lack of good design is what makes it "only" a store of value.

Nice! Last weekend I get 0 answers, this week, with the exact same question I get an ironic answer. Maybe next week I'll have a real answer...

Can I find a clear Dev roadmap somewhere for Bitcoin scaling in the near to far future?
Also another question: what are the options/Dev currently en route concerning the scalability issue ? I am concerned about the mempool not clearing right now and the future if we need to address more transactions
Thank you :-)

In the same way, when lightning comes out, if we need to wait months to only achieve a few percents adoption, the problems will still be there! It's time to first implement on a larger scale the existing technology that Bitcoin possess! Only then it will we see more clearly what has to be done next!
It's useless to have every useful upgrade not used anywhere!

John Cena tweets about bitcoin, two hours laters "ALL TIME HIGH".
It's no coincidence, it's pure correlation!

It was purely ironic

Learn to read graphs, it's in Satoshi for the respective coin, so it's still 8x more costly in $ to use Bitcoin over Bitcoin cash

"What, you say the bitcoin is 3000$? But it's not even real money?"

The article basically takes a quote from Bill Gates from way years ago, then write something ultra vague about it.
The article is 100% useless actually

This could be based on your processor model/type

Imagine a world where every streaming platform is free and adless but you lease X percent of your CPU power!

Isn't the fee calculated by coin? So that 1 satoshi for BCH is 0.15 in $ compared to 1 satoshi for BTC?
It should be interesting to see the same chart but in $ to have a fair comparison

Price is still at its highest, can't argue about that!
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:56:34
No, but you can't say that BTC fees = BCH fees because the unit of measure is not the same
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:57:57
Yes, that's 100% what would happen for sure :-D
