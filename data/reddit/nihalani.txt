Secp256k is a specific curve defined to be used in bitcoin's ECDSA. It was recommended by the NSA and the CES because of it's fast computation time and symmetrical nature. 
Block weight was specifically introduced after the SegWit soft fork. It was made to maintain backwards compatibility. Before Segwit, the was a maximum block size and that transalated to on average a certain amount of transaction. Then Segwit was implemented to increase blocksize.  Basically although transactions are still the same size, segwit transactions count their bytes differently excluding some of them and regular transactions count all of them.  We changed from block size to block weight because we no longer are measuring the size of the blocks.

Actually ASICBoost doesnt work at all of the nonce instead it takes advantage of the fact that the hashing algorithm requires you to split blocks into two seperate parts hash them seperatly and then hash their outputs. Traditionally when you mine,  you change two values the merkle root and the nonce. The nonce only changes one part while the the merkle root changes both parts.  You would try all nonce values and then change the merkle root and retry all the once values. However ASIC boot finds similar Merkle roots that share trailing digits. This enables minors to change the merkle root without changing the contents of the second part. They can then reuse their hash of the second part.
