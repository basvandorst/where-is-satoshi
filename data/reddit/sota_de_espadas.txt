I waited some minutes, but got impatient and used the Task Manager. Memory usage was probably not increasing. Many other things opened: Firefox, Spotify, Discord and the usual shit Windows has on the background. I'm wondering if there's a command line way to close Bitcoin Core in cases like this.

In which country lives your client? Does that money comes from a BTC sell?

Forgot to say, somehow the Bitcoin Core client was not responding so that's why I decided to stop it using the Task Manager.

The 0.25 BTC limit sucks, the rest is OK.

BTC probably will never be a daily use currency due to Gresham Law.

We need more decentralized exhanges like Bisq and Hodl Hodl.

Buy or sell offers.
You can open as many offers as you want but that is the limit for each individual offer.

Bisq, just use Bisq.

I'm using the latest version 0.18.1
Some guy recommended me to use the -reindex parameter.
