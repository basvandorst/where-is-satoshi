Lol I'm pretty sure I work in the building they used to work in. (They are not there anymore and I haven't met them)
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:37:34
Haha, was totally oblivious to that for some reason. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:26:25
I would even say that to some extent reddit is decentralized. Sure there are mods and admins and stuff and they are hosted on central servers, but reddit would work just as fine without mods/admins and on donated servers.

Sorry, I have no experience with node.js...

Hello for charity.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:00:57
What did you buy for $600?
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:01:56
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:22:57
I have. Best experience I have ever had with buying btc.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:56:30
Gambling. I hate to say it, but with something illegal. Of course now I use it for legal thing. ;)
People say Bitcoin would have been more successful if the silk road didnt exist but if the silk road didnt exist, no one would be using it. Im pretty sure a lot of people started off with bitcoin with illegal stuff.

Looks like CloudFlare is doing its job. Worst case scenario, you have to migrate servers and reconfigure CloudFlare again so your new IP's are hidden.
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:54:16
Thanks. I got the same email but the link wasn't working.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:05:06
Even bitcointalk has email notifications, but I agree, Discourse is the best forum software, just a little better than xenforo.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:18:46
If its ruby on rails, I could help.
@_date: 2015-05-06 06:24:33
Also, what's LE?
How does Coinbase know that the address belongs to a DNM?
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:06:57
I have been using celery for a while now. My favorite exchange by far since they don't take much of your information.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:57:40
What's DNM?
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:27:10
Hey. I built  It wouldn't be too hard to add a BTC option to it... If you want we can partner up and do it together. The hard part isn't the code, it's getting people to use the software.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:58:13
Lol, not even close.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:04:14
IMO its not worth $200. I would rather get a trezor or a ledger wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:40:16
When my two favorite things come together.
@_date: 2015-05-02 02:22:18
Lol, you're just pissing them off more and more... Just wait and they will give up!
@_date: 2015-05-02 02:27:52
I am all for laissez faire, so screw regulations. The only regulations that should be put are those directly or indirectly that will help stop scamming.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:19:28
I never had to give the last 4 digits of my SSN to celery.

Electrum should be releasing 2.0 next week.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:24:51


Are you talking about the merchants personal info or the users personal info?
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:35:00
Im pretty sure there is a way around it. Contact coinbase support...
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:23:48
Well Bitpay may have its pros, but there are no point if you cant get your money out of it...

Give TOX a go.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:25:11
Coinbase has no minimum withdrawal, your first million dollars doesn't have any fees, and if you want, converts the BTC to USD and sends it to your bank account every night...
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:23:51
Bitcoin is supposed to be doing that.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:02:52
Let me know if you ever need a wrapper or anything, and I can make a gem for it!
I already made a ruby-gem 
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:57:48


No, im pretty sure it's still there.


All you are doing is showing the user a qr code. I don't think it really makes a difference.


Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:39:30
I see you have migrated successfully! Good luck!
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:39:36
That makes a lot of sense. I'll keep my distance from Coinbase and DNM's.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:07:02
You have competition! 
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:50:59
Same here. My account also got locked. I don't have any money in there though.
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:25:18
I really love this idea, but I dont think its possible to do if you look at it from a programmers perspective. The solution would probably have to be something where the person you are sending the money to sends you a request which you can just accept.
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:46:31
Apparently someone claimed the .io domain for coinfire. I would reccomend you use that.
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:03:06
I got a 404 error when I tried visiting the link.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:52:23
Why nor use Celery? They only ask for minimal amounts of info.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:04:25
Copay. I have fallen in love.
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:58:54
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:43:01
No problems with them.
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:48:21
Copay is my favorite.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:59:13
Toshi.io is on there twice. :P
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:45:22
Celery, no verification needed.
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:33:07
I own coinium.io Would you guys be interested if I created something similar to medium.com for crytocurrencies?
If yes, feel free to reply with your thoughts.
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:22:31
Hey! Would appreciate some bits. All will go towards a site I am working on. Ty.
@_date: 2015-04-11 17:32:45
Lol thanks for the tip. I'll try making one in the summer again. Too busy to do it now.
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:42:41
I like Vires in Numeris. BTW you spelled it wrong in the op.
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:59:20
At max it would be 1k per month. I would say it would be doable at $500 per month if you make use of things like cloudflare ddos protection, and a cdn so you don't have to serve assets (reduces load on server) 
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:42:47
I am asking because I ran a faucet previously (not for profit) but didn't make a single penny off of advertising (to put back into the faucet). Just ended up 0.5 BTC down at the end. I have always wanted to make a self sustaining faucet but haven't been successful. I'm thinking of remaking one through.
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:44:05
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:40:06
Oh shit. Misread your post. Didn't catch the sarcasm.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:53:47
Just sop while you are ahead.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:24:32
Awesome. I got a new idea for a site. ;) 
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:13:22
I'm planning on making something similar but with just text instead of videos. I don't want to allow video uploads because storage space is expensive. Also you have to process each image with requires a lot of CPU and GPU power.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:11:53
They are **literally** rebuilding Discourse. Cmon, 1.5 million dollars?
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:32:11
Most exchanges have an api you can use. Just use the one that is prevalent in your country.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:48:57
This. Puts the great aspects of bitcoin into a few short paragraphs. Also has a really good analogy of cash.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:29:03
YES! Please do other stores. The more stores you accept, the more people you will get!
*it rhymes*
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:15:02
Not looking to make a profit. Just made this so I can add stuff to my resume, and help out the community.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:52:54
One more question: Do you guys have an office or work online?
@_date: 2015-04-11 00:15:33
Screw all the sites and their fees. Use [this]( a self hosted Coinbase alternative.
It works as long as you don't need to convert your BTC to USD.
*there is a minor bug that needs to be fixed before you use it though*
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:20:22
Slightly off topic: Is this a side project or is this project your full time job?
Also, how do you guys get Starbucks cards for 20% off?
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:45:30
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:38:40
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:51:17
I don't use a mobile wallet, but the three most used ones (on android) are Bitcoin Wallet, Mycelium, and Blockchain.
*sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors. I am on my phone*
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:03:16
It works based on wish lists so even if the person is using stolen credit cards, it causes no harm to you.
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:47:50
Where is this?
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:41:52
Sent an email! :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:06:32
What's OP_RETURN? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:10:08
Great that you are doing this.
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:20:07
Lol, congrats.
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:37:18
You can use  to order it on amazon for up to 20% off.
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:52:06
Oh, this is nice. I never knew you could throw messages into the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:32:46
Large retail stores, Amazon, walmart, best buy, Fry's electronics, target, etc...
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:08:42
Adblock is great but ublock is better.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:14:04
Im a pretty sure this is not against the rules. If it is, please let me know and ill take down the post. Feel free to PM me, or reply to this thread if you have any question!
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:12:03
Check out telegram.org. I believe it is p2p.
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:22:49
I was wondering if you would be interested in taking an intern.
I'll work for free, etc... If you are interested, let me know and I can send in my resume and more info.

Talk about the 10k bitcoin pizza.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:05:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:29:44
What service do you use for your ads?
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:30:09
Nvm. You already answered that.
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:06:54
Trusted? Yes, it's provably fair. Good? No, gambling is never good.
Still the best gambling site, IMO.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:30:31
How much do you get from google?
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:03:26
The op is willing to donate 100's of thousands, so I don't see why it can't be afforded.
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:15:03
Don't they own the domains? Even if *we* split, they have control over the homepage. Everyone who is learning about bitcoin for the first time will always end up going to bitcoin.org
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:01:16
Coinbase (exchange, not service).
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:13:17
I take my bip32 privkey, then encrypt it with my pgp key, and then store the encrypted message somewhere safe. That's good enough security for me.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:27:45
Yes I have heard of you. The first think I did when I heard of fold app coffee was to look it up on the play store. So your app will provably be the best way to increase usage.
Also allow things like offline usage and link up with some of the android wallets to instantly pay for the card.
@_date: 2015-04-05 08:07:09
Then no problem. Let's do this! 
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:36:59
And what's the replacement?
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:18:37
Why not just go with a self hosted alternative? You won't have to deal with anything. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:55:41
I'm working on something similar already.
Edit: PM me if you want some more info. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 04:08:24
From what I can see, it's pretty much like signing a bitcoin address? What's the difference? 
@_date: 2015-03-02 05:07:46
This, and it costs nothing. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:23:22
This is a known issue. I'm not sure when they will fix it though. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:47:01
Even better. Have a chrome extension where when they click a bitcoin link, it auto fills the info. That's what coinbase does. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:29:38
Electrum is the best. It's easy to use, and really easy to install on Ubuntu. Also I like the fact that it's an HD wallet so I only have to store one key for all my addresses. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:26:41
Use coinbase to buy your BTC but use something else to actually store them. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:15:27
Slightly incorrect. Uber owns work vehicles. Facebook constantly makes blog posts on updates. Airbnb owns some real estate (their office buildings).
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:00:42
Why not buy a BTC every year? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:40:59
For those using Ubuntu, here is how you install Electrum 2.0.
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
    sudo pip install 
If you get an error saying: `Error: No module named google.protobuf. Try 'sudo pip install &lt;module-name&gt;`, run this:
    sudo pip install protobuf
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2015-10-16 01:25:15
And cheap too. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:33:22
Yeah. Forgot to mention that. You only need to do that with .10 OS's. I run .04 so the error never showed up for me.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:04:31
What app is this? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:42:00
Electrum for the exact same reasons on Ubuntu. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:34:59
Wow, it looks completely different from the website. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:42:26
Ah. Kk.
