Hopefully I can find someone to do this with. I've checked out localbitcoin like others have suggested but everyone charges way too much.

Did everything work out ok? I would like to find a trustworthy individual that I can buy from.

I'd love to buy more but Coinbase credit card limits are stupid. To increase my limit it says to wait 60 days. Bunch of crap.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:01:08
Correct! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:19:27
I've never done that before.

Which one of you ass-wipes is pushing this price up?
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:01:50
I swear to God I can't take it. I've been waiting a fucking week for prices to dip so I could buy in. Last night I decided to buy at $9200.00 since no big dips were happening for so long. Look what happens as soon as I buy. For Christ's sake!

I did that lots of times and the price never got close to it. I figured why not buy in at $9200, set a limit sell at $9400 while I'm asleep. Then it dips.

Where's the drop for today? I want some cheap bitcoin.

This sucks so bad. I started a bank transfer to my USD Wallet on Coinbase two days ago with the intent of buying a bitcoin. I have to wait 7 days and Bitcoin is already up $1K-$1.5K from when I started the transfer.

I think I'm just going to go to a CPA next year to do mine.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:24:13
Nightmare? I don't consider 9.4K as low.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:25:55
Nah, I'm in this to make a quick buck. If I can't get that to happen then I'm pulling out altogether.

I butt-fucked the dog. Then I butt-tongued five dogs. Now what?

How will the calculation of my capital gains tax work next year? I have money on GDAX and I am constantly buying and selling. Do you need to take each sell transaction through the year and add them up as your total profit? Or do you add up all of your sell transactions through the year and subtract your total buy transactions for the year to get your net profit or loss?
