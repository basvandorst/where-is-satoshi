Wow, mostly wrong on all counts. If you'd like to help your cause, best just keep quiet.

Guess how I can tell your degree has no math component?

There's plenty of good arguments against excessive military spending, which makes me wonder why you had to make such a bad one.

Invasion has nothing to do with it. Who do you think secures the shipping channels that global commerce depends on?

Sheer ignorance.

Free health care for all*

So what you really mean by "free health care for all" is "free health care for us, good luck everyone else."

You're being hyperbolic and dishonest.
I don't like the idea of "private" prisons either, but to say they are "our worst enemy" is completely misguided.

I'm so glad that our loving government gets in the way of the free market. How else could we have things like the war on drugs, the war on terror, control of the monetary base, bailouts, domestic surveillance, the military-industrial complex, the prison-industrial complex, etc. 
It's for our own protection, after all.

"Private" prisons make up a small part of the incarceration industry.
Telecom was fucked in the first place due to regional monopolies granted by local governments.
