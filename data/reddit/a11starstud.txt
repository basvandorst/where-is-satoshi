Think about it, btc didnt hit a ath with 10000's of random ass coins. The market needs to kills these so the valuable 25 or so coins can recover. Instead of this stupid back and forth shit.

Bitcoin does well, everything jumps. Bitcoin is already in a decline. If btc drops everything drops ten folds. May a well drain them, clean up. Also july has been a low month for btc over the years.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:28:11
True but they would be back to just test the water with btc. Fomo is real, especially with money
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:00:34
Down vote me all you want. But in order for bitcoin to hit a new ath. It needs to drop enough that all shit coins are wiped out as well. So that market cap can go back into btc.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:43:07
July has always been historically low check the charts

The price of bitcoin reminds me of that luda song "How low"
* Bitcoin could go lower than I ever really thought it could,
* Portfolio down, FUD up!
* The top of ATH had me jiggling out my jeans,
* I had to pull my pants up,
* I liked it when I seen you ATH,
* Better then I see it these days,
* A lot of nocoiners drop to the ground,
* But how low can you go?
* Lower then I ever seen in my life time,
* Never would've imagined these low levels not even in my right mind,
* Practice crying in front of that mirror,
* I could go low, (Go low) lower than you know,
* Go low (go low) lower than you know,
* Go low (go low) lower than you know,
* Go low (go low) lower than you know
