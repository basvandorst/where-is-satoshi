Unless having a larger pool of starting money or more varied sources of starting money somehow helped them. But yeah, like any financial service on TOR, they were most likely scams.

It's almost certain the Bitcoin creator was very familiar with Nick Szabo's ideas, but the writing analysis has been called into question.  As someone suggested above, there's a lot of people out there with the technical know-how that they could have programmed Bitcoin. And Nick Szabo (and Wei Dai who thought up B-money) had already put into place most of the ideas.
All it took was one anonymous person who had the incredible amount of foresight to understand the genius behind Nick Szabo's Bitgold and Wei Dai's B-money before they looked like anything but the out there ramblings of a blogger.
So really, while Szabo is a good lead, we essentially haven't narrowed it down at all. And I hope it stays that way.

There's a fucking hilarious and supremely clever satirical book called A Confederacy of Dunces that's more or less about this quote. I always recommend it because I feel sorry for the author; he was a no-name who couldn't get a publisher deal and ended up committing suicide. Soon after, the book was published and became a best seller.

Sometimes we need people who live in an idealistic dream world. Ten years ago everyone laughed at GNU and free software. Now anyone in the tech industry is a fool to ignore their presence... We can thank Stallman for playing a big part in that.

Yes, when writing English text for an international audience, be sure to make it as American as possible. Y'all.

I'm not sure if they were the real deal or not but there were websites on the TOR network claiming to take advantage of MtGox's transaction malleability issues. All you had to do was send them some BTC and they'd handle everything, give you your money back and then some, and take a 5% cut.
