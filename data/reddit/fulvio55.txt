Tell the kid to start with Dogecoin. The fees won't kill him.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:09:08
Interesting business model.
Still, 24 hours sucks, when Dogecoin does it in 60 seconds or less.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:58:17
Its not a good idea. That's why people use Dogecoin for small transactions instead.
But its funny, and you're totally missing the point.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:30
You're not seeing the double standard here, are you?
WHY is Bitcoin selling for the current pricing? And how did it get from Zero to Hero?
Even the biggest fans will admit its a crap currency. Its slow. Its Expensive. Its really difficult to use. In every way, Dogecoin blows it out of the water, and as the only crypto that actually works just like a 'real' currency, it SHOULD be miles ahead.
But its not. Partially because of this really stupid fixation with the whole 'joke' thing, partially because of vested interests, but basically because people don't understand it.
So, if you look at it from the same perspective, why shouldn't it have the same market cap as Bitcoin, or any other crypto? Why is Litecoin attracting such support, when its also really unsuited to the task, and is nothing but a Bitcoin clone?
Methinks you need a little objectivity. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:14:39
Heh, I've met hundreds of people who thought that too. Mind you, having seen the way people with vested interests push BTC to the exclusion of everything else, I'm not surprised.
The best way to think of Doge is as ***'Training Wheels for Cryptocurrency'***.
Newbies make mistakes. That's just par for the course, and we spend an awful lot of time getting them over their stuffups over on But when you make a mistake with Bitcoin, its very, very expensive. Like the guy who spent twice as much in fees than the amount he was moving. So a very forgiving currency, where it takes a minute or two for transactions to complete rather than all day, and where fees are virtually non-existent, and where a coin has a low enough value that it won't break the bank, is definitely the way to go.
Later, having learnt how things work, the knowledge is fully transferrable to other cryptos, and they can go nuts without the risk of shooting themselves in the face. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:52:14
LOL! Send Doge instead. 1 Doge fee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:24:10
Oh yeah?
And yet.. over a quarter of a million people **DO**, and both the transactional and trade volumes confirm that.
Isn't it strange how some people can get so fixated on their own prejudices that they completely ignore something which is far superior to their own particular view? Dogecoin has always been faster, cheaper and easier to use than Bitcoin, and in percentage terms, at least as profitable as well.
 Rose, by any other name...
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:15:06
For using BCC. We know BTC fees are around $6, and Doge 1/5 of a cent.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:18:45
Not at all.
Bitcoin's inflation rate is just over 4%. Dogecoin is only slightly higher.
You really should get your facts straight. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:39:11
Oh, y'gotta have some Bitcoin! They're going to be a million bucks each, remember?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:54:01
Trade it for Doge, send them that for free.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:47:05
My pleasure. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:45:27
Still time-limited. Whether its a millisecond or a nanosecond, its not instant.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:46:43
And what are the fees on 0.000023 BTC?
They could charge 120 or even 150 Dogecoins, and pay a 1 Doge fee.
And, because the network has far more capacity, they could even pay **ZERO** fees and the transactions would still go though in a couple of minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:47:13
And what would the fees be?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:34:19
Hopefully you'll do much better than the 140,000 I did overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:03:41
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:41:05
Yup. Ditto.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:52:52
Yeah, I thought so.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:45:14
We need to get as many people as possible to go to the fake site at walletgenerator.org and generate a few million Bulk wallets. Flooding his log file with empty wallets should make it that much more difficult to steal victims' coins.

The kid haz nachural skillz... get him over to immediately! :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:06:08
Have you told him about Dogecoin too? People are using it for allowances and internal trading within families:
*"Practical real world use for DOGE:*
*I've given doge to my wife (to hand out) and kids (to collect). They all have doge wallets on their smart devices. It's used as a currency inside our house for various things... chores... rewards... punishments (you hit your brother, pay a 300 doge fine!). Kids will trade each either doge for chore duty. It's treated like play money that's almost real money.....but they can't go buy it so it has worth because to them, it's RARE and they can't get it unless we hand it out. So even though there's a small ($) after the doge.... the doge itself takes on a worth of its own. It's a "point" system that they can't cheat at. The quick verification and super tiny-tiny transaction fee makes it perfect for this.*
*Most recent example, I told my 6 year old to pick up toys that his younger brother had dragged out. As is normal for a 6 year old boy, he complained. I offered him 20 doge, and he jumped at it, did a great job, and enjoyed seeing how much doge he was getting in his wallet. I know I know, they all have chores they're expected to do anyway, this is just kind of a fun bonus system. I challenge anyone anyone to offer their kid 1/3rd of a penny to pick up toys and have them excited to do it.*
*My kids now have more crypto currency experience than 99% of the population. They no doubt will lose a wallet sometime in the future, and learn a valuable lesson that couldn't be taught for the amount of money in doge that will be lost when that happens (pennies most likely!)*
*So it's kind of used like an in-family "tipping" currency I guess. But since we keep it rare, it takes on it's own worth."*
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:22:03
OK, so with a little back of the envelope guesstimating, we'd need a few thousand people to flood him enough to stop him I reckon.
Given human inertia and the sort of reactions I've had to my comments, I'd predict these types of attacks will be successful and more widespread.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:53:03
You wouldn't. Hoard BTC, spend Doge.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:47:56
Which is why BTC makes no sense as a currency, yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:13:49
When Bitcoin was that price, Doge didn't exist.
So following your line of reasoning, Doge will also be worth $11,000 in due course. :P
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:52:30
What is this word, 'buy'? We're talking about criminals here...
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:20:25
That's not how it works.
Dogecoin is $2.31/thousand right now. In Sept, it was 81 cents. For Doge to double, that would take it to $4.62. Bitcoin would have to hit $22,000. Which do you think more likely?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:14:27
Yes, I realise all that. Do you realise that the inflation rate drops over time, and will drop below the globally accepted 'sweet spot' of 2.5-3% within the decade?
And as for relying on transaction fees, what a great way to cripple a currency by putting a massive tax on its use. That has to be the biggest fail in crypto, and Doge was the only one to avoid that trap.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:51:10
And that's why we have Dogecoin. An actual working currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:56:47
Who are you? The Grinch?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:32:07
The last time I tried to pay low fees, the transaction never went through at all.
In theory, using  you can pay zero fees. This works fine for Doge, but I wouldn't even try with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:26:58
The bottleneck is the time to query the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:04:55
And how are you going to steal the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:49:18
Lemonade for 120 Dogecoins is dead simple though. Even with a 1 Doge fee. And 2 mins vs 2 hours to go through. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:21:05
Get the key for that wallet, and use coinb.in to send the coins. In theory, the fee can be zero, but it would likely never get picked up. Others claim that 1 satoshi works though. Shrug. YMMV.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:25:40
Who cares about value anyway? Its the thought that counts. The value will look after itself, one way or another.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:25:16

Pardon me for being a grammar nazi, but you left a **T** out of that. ;)
Yeah, I know... harsh. But then I've dealt with bureaucrats who dazzle you with their bullshit about working together, consultation and favourable outcomes while in actual fact they already have it all worked out and are just keeping you from doing anything to stop them until its too late.
Ben showed up four months ago, blew a bunch of smoke up our arses, then came back to drop the bombshell. He doesn't want consultation. He wants to get his regs passed as close to intact as he can.
We're supposed to freak out, and negotiate a less draconian outcome, which is still a bad deal, but better than what's being proposed.
What we should do instead is raise the biggest stink possible, and get the whole shitty idea flushed down the dunny where it belongs.
And make no mistake, there's a thousand more Bens out there waiting in the wings for their shot at us. If he gets away with it, they'll tear us to shreds.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:10:51

Since I've been given time out in the naughty chair, let me expand on this.. once upon a time there were two currency subreddits. One rewarded people and made it fun to be there. The other penalised people for giving money away randomly. Clearly the latter was superior, because.... no... wait... ;)

The whole world is **NOT** the US of A. I can buy Doge just as easily, or more easily, than BTC. And I can also earn it far more easily. In fact, my only BTC earnings come from GAW Hashlets *(Boooo!)* and BTCjam lending *(minus the losses from the many many scammers)*.
That's probably why both my Doge holdings and economic use are an order of magnitude higher than my BTC.
However, regarding the rest of the alts, I might concur...
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:43:37
Change.org is effective as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, a more direct campaign. Its a force multiplier. Strike the right chord, and our 200,000 could become 20 million, and that would be noticed.

All bashing is toxic, regardless of where it happens, and against whom. I've copped a ton of flak over a couple of controversies myself, and I know full well how soul-destroying it can be.
But just like arguments about skin colour or gender or religious convictions are meaningless when the alien death rays are about to wipe the planet out, the arguments about algos or inflation or decimal points are meaningless when the banksters set out to destroy us through their bureaucratic proxies.
Us and Them means Cryptos vs The Establishment right now.

I have to admit I'm a total changetip noob. I've been tipped small amounts by a couple of guys ages ago, but never did anything more. And this in spite of the millions I've put through dogetipbot.
Maybe if there was one bot that handled multiple currencies? That would be cool, especially if it also did NuBits. Wonder how feasible such a thing would be?

@_date: 2014-04-29 13:20:26
Don't presume to know why I did anything. FYI, I do tip runs through regularly, where I tip up to a thousand people. This is something we do a lot of, in varying amounts, and its what makes the community what it is. As someone posted an hour ago in the Moofund thread, the stats stand at:
* BTC 0
* VTC 0
* LTC 0
* Dogecoin 2795916
Which speaks volumes I think. I just checked, and its now 2815937 doge and just under 12 VTC, the others still zero.
I don't care what currency someone uses. But in decades of experience in several industries, I have noted that certain types of people are attracted to and motivated by different things. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there is a clear difference between proponents of these two, and I have yet to see anything in the bitcoin community that holds a candle to the dogecoin community. I'm even hard pressed to describe BTC people as a community at all in fact. Shareholders, Investors, Stakeholders, sure, but community? I've seen no evidence of that to date.
Which is a great shame I think. Because without community, all you have is the recognition of being the first, and that doesn't last.
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:45:29
This wasn't the place to ask this question, as you probably realise after seeing the responses and downvotes. :(
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:22:11
I'm amazingly chilled. And I both recognise and respect the community. Some of the asshattery.. not so much. Though acts of generosity and kindness, such as a random bitcoin tipping spree would certainly cast a different light, I won't hold my breath waiting for that to happen.
*Full disclosure:* I have held BTC, but no longer, and likely won't in future.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:34:09
No, but our bites are worse than our barks. Now point out that dude so we can chew his arse off!
BTW, he dropped his bombshell and vanished. Clearly has a masters degree in community engagement. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-21 03:05:04
Then that doesn't bode well for BTC faucets generally then, does it? They clearly can't pay out instantly on the blockchain like the doge ones do. And lacking easy ways to get some coins into newbies' pockets to play with can't be good for attracting the general public, surely?

Speaking as a pensioner, not a college kiddy, and as a newcomer to both dogecoin and reddit, I have to say I think you're wrong. The community spirit I've seen in less than a day has been awesome, and while I haven't gone from zero to hero, I have both received and tipped significantly, and have seen doge in space, doge on NASCAR, doge helping the needy all over the world, and massive amounts of fun.
Not at all like my previous encounters with cryptos. My LTC balance still remains at zero, after many months. And BTC? Well, that's for rich kids, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:21:39
Maybe *most* will die out, but not all. Dogecoin is certainly here for the long haul, Darkcoin too. NuBits...

@_date: 2014-07-19 12:28:20
Friendly rivalry is one thing, competition another. But too often we've had this Us and Them mentality, in both camps *(and I'm told in other walled gardens I don't visit)*.
Well, the time has come to put all that aside, and pull together to stop a common enemy out to destroy us all.
So whether you use Doge, BTC *(yes, I hold both)*, or any other crypto, and whether you live in NYC or Mogadishu, you need to climb aboard this bus right now!
Maybe we need a Crypto Defence Force, along the lines of the DDF? ;)

Kinda reminds me of a scene in **Lord of the Rings** ... *"Precious..."*
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:40:14

No, we need to stop it before it takes root, and spawns a hundred copycats across the world. There are Banksters and Bureaucrats and Politicians in every corner of the globe who would love to see us all disappear so they can get on with business as usual.

I was about to downvote you, then I read it again...
Poor choice of words, but I get where you're coming from. Yes, the whole concept of a random open source project by some pseudonymous guy **IS** absurd. Just as absurd as a dog on a coin, or any of the other copycats.
There's nothing even slightly wrong with being absurd. If the serious suits on Wall St had been a little less taken with their own cleverness and seriousness, maybe the world wouldn't have been raped and left for dead by that pack of pricks.
The same pricks who now want to screw us into oblivion.

@_date: 2015-08-15 06:05:29
I've used CoinSpot for over a year. Volume is a little low right now, and Westpac messing them around has led to less convenience getting cash in, but if you're not in a rush its still quite viable.
Otherwise there are a number of reliable traders, such as Bitcoin Babe who sell direct. Oh, and of course we have ATMs..

Couldn't agree more.. though you should take your own advice and fix your typos too. ;)

Yup. Every time I see something written by an illiterate teenager using English as a second (or third?) language, I run away screaming.
The sad part is they neither comprehend nor care what harm they're doing to the language, and how in time it will devolve to monosyllabic grunts. :(

It was probably a bad idea to include Bitcoin at all, judging by the flames. ;)

I don't know what I'm talking about, eh?
It doesn't matter when the transaction arrives. What matters is when the coins can be respent. Typically 10 min to an hour. Vs 1 min typically. And yes, the banking system sucks, we can totally agree on that.
BTC fee is what, 0.0003? Doge is 1. How is 63 satoshi not 'cheaper' than 30,000?
I've been talking cryptos to the great unwashed for about a year now. I've seen more glazed stares than I can remember. Doge is dead easy to explain. *"20 cents per thousand or $200 per million"* is much easier than trying to explain what a satoshi or bit is worth. The human mind just doesn't work well with numbers like 0.74279361, but thousands and millions are a snap.
You may think nobody cares, and within BTC fan circles that may well be right. But all of us put together don't even constitute a margin of error in relation to the world's population. Fact is, a single crypto won't hack it, any more than a single fiat would. And Doge is the obvious alternative, whether you use BTC or not.

Nah, ditch the shit**heads** instead... they're as useless as coloured punctuation. :P

You expected better from Buttcoiners?
This thread looks pretty much exactly like I've come to expect from this sub. It doesn't stop me using my BTC, but it does stop me having anything to do with what laughingly passes for a *'community'* here.

You mean like they all went to Microsoft and ignored Apple until it was too late?

I don't think you're trying to be a jerk. I do think you're being unnecessarily patronising when you don't know my background, knowledge or capabilities.
I use several currencies, but I also see their flaws and limitations. Bitcoin has some severe handicaps, and advantages which basically boil down to being first and biggest. Doge has issues as well, as do all cryptos to date, but the number of coins available, and the inbuilt inflation, are huge plusses.
Yes, BTC is the tool of choice in the financial world, but that isn't really a plus, because the bankster mentality is what brought us to the need for cryptos in the first place. And as with toolkits, one size does not fit all... if all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.
From a community standpoint, I see massive arrogance and fear, pretty well exemplified in this thread. Bitcoiners are frightened of competing coins, because they think they will be hurt by them. Shibes on the other hand look at the bigger picture and just get on with introducing as many people as possible to Dogecoin, and to cryptos in general. That's why there were Dogecars, but no Bitcars. That's why tipping was an early foundation for Dogecoin, but a recent afterthought in the BTC community. I could go on, but you get the picture.
***"There can be only One"*** is a mindset best left out of cryptos.

BTC won't die. Nor will Doge, but for quite different reasons. LTC, well, don't have any, never had any, never will. ;)
Market cap is pretty meaningless in the big scheme of things. BTC dropped what, 75% of its value? Doesn't mean a thing. Unless you were 'invested' in it, but that would be foolish at this stage of the game. To give you an idea, I hold maybe 3 or 4 BTC at any one time, but I continue to accumulate Doge, currently something like 15 million or so. And I turn my Doge over a lot more than my BTC, which mainly go to lending sites. Did you know we often move well over 100% of our market cap daily? Today was 64% when I looked a few hours ago.
Sure, if everyone climbed aboard, our valuation and market cap would soar. And just like it did a year ago, the whales would pump and dump it and hurt people in the process. I'd much rather see stability and organic growth. I'm not looking to make $15 million profit next week.
Anyway, I see we're back in the  slot, and the gap to LTC is a lot less than it used to be, so we'll see where things go once we hit our 100 Billion in a couple weeks time.

Ever used it? I had to move 1 BTC overseas to hit an exchange before the banks closed. Didn't arrive in time, they had to do it the next day and missed a deadline.
Doge? So close to instant it doesn't matter. And cheaper. One whole Dogecoin miner fee. Plus no need to grab a calculator to figure out where to put the decimal point.
And don't get me started on Bits... just another way to confuse people. Doge is just so much easier for people to get their heads around, its really no comparison, especially for noobs, which 99.99999% of the world would qualify as.

I for one spend a ton more doge than BTC. Its just so much easier, faster and more convenient.
Besides which, when Dogecoin drags new users into crypto, they inevitably end up with BTC as well. Stop being so parochial.
