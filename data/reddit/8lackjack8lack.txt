You are right.
Meet me at Purdue Pharma HQ and let's do our duty and perform a citizens arrest on these opioid selling super villains.

Gold is launching also.
Trouble is brewing somewhere in the world.
When there is blood on the streets, buy gold (which is what crypto basically is now but obviously more digitally useful )

That’s what a wise friend of mine said.
It’s the 10-20 year cycle where they wait for us to get forgetful on the horrors of war.
The longer and more horrific the previous war, the longer they wait between drinks.
WW1 (1918)
WW2 (1939-1945)
Vietnam (Officially started in 1955 but really US escalation began in 1960 - 1975)
Gulf War (1991)
War on Terror (2001)
New war (2019/20?)
Just got to wait until a new generation of kids, who are ignorant of the previous war, are ready to wilfully sign up to be slaughtered.
Any youngsters who are reading this.
No matter what happens against the USA.
Don’t for one second think you have a duty to your country. Because your country will conveniently forget their duty to you.
The people in power don’t give a fuck about you when you come back up all torn up. Ask the Vietnam veterans, ask the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans.
- Come back with permanent loss of hearing due to gunfire right next to your ears?
“Non service related injury” = medical compensation denied. ��‍♂️
And that’s a more mild case of what happens.

And it's 3.5x the price it was in 2000...

Not in a short term sense.
Gold and silver has never had the volatility of Bitcoin.
Long term it has done extremely well.

To be honest, that wouldn't be the worst idea.
Everything you just wrote is true and feels more disgusting every time I read it back.

Where the hell has this incel stuff come from?
I’ve never heard him say the word “incel” once?
I have heard him speak on enforced monogamy but never heard him champion it like a diehard Manchester United fan or something like this.
More like he said words to the effect that “it’s not good when the top 20% of men get 80% of the women”
“men (general population) lash out in violent/criminal ways if they feel the game is rigged”.
Remember JP is expert social psychologist. 
And when he says “enforced monogamy”.
He doesn’t mean enforced by the government/powers that be.
He means forced through social pressure.
He means championing traditional male -female relationships. He means calling out promiscuous behaviour (mainly women but also men as well) so that couples stick together. Remembering that women can fuck when they like but men have to put in effort. 
As for the “incels” he “supports”... The way I read it is ... he’s not supporting their behaviour. 
He’s encouraging them to better themselves so they become attractive.

Because Bill C-16, the law amendment that Jordan Peterson fights against, is the first law in English common law history to ever compel speech.  Ever!
Forcing people by law to use (made up and an ever expanding list of) gender pro-nouns.
It’s not that Jordan Peterson fights became he’s transphobic.
What’s wrong with this subreddit on Jordan Peterson?
Bitcoin is supposed to be about anti-establishment and decentralisation.
Jordan Peterson’s life work has included and a lot of study and recently a fight against Marxist and Communist ideology.  He has studied it for 30+ years. 
Read: warn us and battle the authoritarians and centralisation people. (Communists)
The Bill C-16 law is the same type of laws that communists of decades gone used to inact.

He doesn’t offer support to young white males.
None of his books or interviews have specifically mentioned that he is aiming at young white males.
It just happens that they probably make up a small majority of his fan base.

Lol 
What are you smoking?


A centrally planned economy is an economic system in which the state or government makes economic decisions.


How stupid do you feel coming in here throwing names and a quick copy and paste DESTROYED you.
Edit: just so u/doublejay1999 doesn’t get to delete his comment and username after he realises how he stupid he is... here it is in all of its moronic glory.
“Communism is the opposite of centralisation you thick twat”

They may not be new ideas. I have thought the same thing but they are ideas/philosophies and behaviours that have been lost in recent times. 
Personal responsibility has been lost in a world full of victim hood culture. Free speech and telling the truth are ideals that cause controversy now. 
The “monetise social justice warriors” quote was a tongue in cheek moment if you go back and watch the show.

Sigh �� 
The bitcoin subreddit is probably the most intellectually lazy group I have surprisingly come across.
I just really didn’t expect a group of people involved in a community project that is supposed to be about decentralisation and freedom, totally mischaracterise a man (Jordan Peterson) that at his core is against centralisation (communism) and is pro freedom.
So many comments just tearing shreds off a man who you would find with just a modicum of research is not even close to alt-right.
