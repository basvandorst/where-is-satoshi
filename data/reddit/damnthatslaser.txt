I mean is there any physical exchange that lists transparent fees? I haven't seen those ones yet. Go to any country, any bank there, they are always "no commission", covering their expenses via spread. Displaying your fees upfront is something you rather see on stock markets.
Since cryptocurrencies are kinda inbetween those two (used like currencies, but traded like assets), I'm not surprised to see either option used.
Also the spread is not artificial or fake, anyone is free to have both a buy and a sell offer, and by the way any of those markets work, there's a self-chosen spread between those.

I mean if you speculate on fluctuation, you normally have a sell order, and for that order to be able to become effective, your coins need to be on the exchange.

ah okay, sorry in that case

That's not true.


And neither is this.
Monero uses ~~[RingCT]( [Bulletproofs]( and [Stealth Addresses]( for anonymity. Funds don't get "mixed" on chain. It was forked from Bytecoin (it was based on the Cryptonote prococol), but not from its blockchain.

Yeah, that's the Group BTC office or whatever close to Retiro Park. They operate about 3 Bitcoin ATMs in Madrid AFAIK.
I considered going there last time I was in Madrid but in the end just used Kraken for convenience, especially since I didn't want Bitcoin, but would have just used it as an intermediate currency.

This sounds more like a classic on-chain scenario.


How so? What changes in that regard? You don't "need" KYC for on-chain BTC movement, it's just that the exchanges do it to comply with regultions; but if they then finally move your funds via classic on-chain or LN to your wallet doesn't matter.

How does this differ from on-chain transactions? I get the point of LN; but the advantages you cite and the cases aren't valid from my PoV. LN shines where a) transaction volume is low so transaction fees become significant and b) you want a fast confirmation.
The store-to-store scenario you listed is the opposite of that: in international business, 20 minutes for sending money don't matter, the shipping will most likely be much later anyways; amounts are usually that high that transaction fees are not that significant; and for such a transaction, having an on-chain entry with everything as a proof is better. LN makes more sense in the "I go to the bakery and spend $2 in BTC" scenario.


Neither do you for on-chain, KYC is technically completely unnecessary for BTC and just an additional organizational measure.


I agree on the idea that this enables payments that are usual in the "apps" scenario, but not for the reason you listed.


LN in any case is additional work compared to on-chain. It might solve the congestion problem, but it's not making anything easier per se.

Alright, OK. I read the original question as


Emphasis mine because otherwise the question would just have been "why Bitcoin".

None, they have their own wallet it seems, at least from their "Cryptocurrencies" page.

Difficulty is a fixed term though and it refers to the number of tries to find a block. The block reward is something else. They both tie into the profitability calculation, but as different variables.

Maybe someone can educate me a bit here. Am not invested in Bitcoin but it doesn't really matter on the topic. What follows is my understanding and why I think futures make absolutely zero sense in crypto.
Futures are a financial instrument for companies that need a somewhat large amount of a physical good that may fluctuate in price in the future. And either the good doesn't exist yet for them or they don't want to store the good until they need it, but they want to plan their expenses. So what they do is they sign a futures contract, which tells them that they will receive the good in the future at price X. The price is normally an estimation of the seller or whoever makes the futures contract of the good at the time of delivery plus a premium for the service. That premium is lower than what would cost the company buying the good now and store it until needed (if that is even possible, since not all goods can be stored for longer periods of time). But it's normally the current price plus a premium. Also you need to pay the goods sooner or later.
Now cryptocurrencies don't have the issue of storing because there is nothing to store really except your private keys. Just make a cold wallet, put your coins there, super low initial cost and no running cost. There's no scenario where a futures contract makes sense, and the "warehouse" discussion highlights that very well. Just buy the coins if you want to gamble, and use leverage if you want to super gamble. But futures? Come on…

yup, rather spend another 80% on transaction fees.
