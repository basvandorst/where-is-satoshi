Sorry to hear about your BIL passing away.  
Hopefully he didnt spend too much to acquire a safe full of Iraqi Dinars.  You are right - some of them used hard earned money - saved from repeated personal sacrifices - just to buy a worthless dream.

Amazing - how common it has become to describe bankers as crooks and no one bats an eyelid.  Don't even care to hire PR guys to try to soften the narrative.  Why bother when they have Buffet/Mnuchin to proclaim their saintliness.
"The disappearance of the coins and watches suggests that Wells Fargo — which in recent years has admitted to systematically ripping off customers with [fake accounts]( hidden fees and [a variety of unwanted and unnecessary financial products]( — didn’t follow that law."

Thank you for writing.  Yes, the harder you fight the more she'll dig in and at some point, it becomes personal.  Good that she has not parted with significant money.  
These kind of scams traps people from all walks of lives, regardless of intelligence levels.

Thanks for sharing your story.  Valuable experience for us - ie. even selling your apartment for BTC instead of cash helped you stay alive.  It seems you stay positive, which is great.  Realize it is difficult to speak out since you have family/friends back there.
Just like you, I would be afraid of trading my last 0.2BTC.  It may save you again.
\- There are a few people who have made a lot of money trading BTC, but the success rate is probably smaller than neighborhood kids that made it to the NBA.  
\- I'm 100% sure, the guys selling the trading courses do better, regardless of quality.
Question:  Is it economical to mine BTC in Peru?  If yes, you have the expertise setting up mining rigs etc - I would think there are people who want to get started and don't know how to.  Start BTC related consulting - it can be you bringing 10 people together etc.  
\- Start a meetup group - offer services - consumer side - like how to secure BTC, how to send etc.  
Given your personal experience, you will be good, but not sure if that is too high profile for now.
Any one of the countries we live in can also go the way of Venezuela.  It starts slowly, and then happens fast.  
I'll help in a tiny way, again thx for the learning.

No self respecting BTC fan would bother.  Saw that he's worth about $60M - he can afford to insult BTC - BTC at any price won't make any difference in his lifetime.
It's like going into the Holiest of Holys of another religion and attempting to convert.
What's more is Pomp and a few guys sent him a few hundred $$ worth of BTC - they should have sent it to someone in Venezuela or Africa.

Lightning -
1. Go to ads4satoshis - you can generate 20sats/day/device/24 hrs for viewing ads.  No signup, just withdraw to your lightning wallet.  Even though too tiny to make a difference at least you get to test rcvg funds.
2. Also try [Niffler.co]( \- its a paper trading site, but depending on how your portfolio does you can withdraw rewards as satoshis.

Add a passphrase - 25th word.
An exploit - unlikely without physical possession of the Trezor - was announced, by Ledger's security team.   Adding a passphrase nullifies this exploit.
Here's the response by Trezor, [
Here's the original video - scroll, half way down to see the video.
PS - Not my business, but the way Ledger went about announcing it didnt seem all that cool..... but no one said business is only for boy scouts.

Thanks, running Lightning-APP on MacOS.  Wallet is funded and can receive, but I cannot send out as Lightning or even BTC/Segwit.  I am not sure, but believe it is stuck trying to open channels.

Hold it on a hardware device.  Anything left on the exchange should be just trading funds.  In any event, any trader willing to pay the fees, can get it across in an hour.  Fees as high as they maybe, will pale in comparision to loosing the principal.

OP - maybe too late for the AMA - but see this thread from the other day.  It was a huge eye opener for me (even if not proven to be 100% true).  Stay safe.  [
My question would be have you heard / know first hand people who've been in the same position?
If you are comfortable posting your BTC/Lightning address, I'll do a small token amt.
For what its worth - the blue wallet app supports lightning very well.  The lightning wallet is custodial, but it works.  At least 1 faucet type websites out there - but I suppose generating 20 sats/day/device isn't going to cut it even in VZ.
@_date: 2019-11-10 14:05:49
Thanks for this.
I tried downloading BTC Core, on an older iMAC (2012?) - my connection is rather slow, but took a couple of weeks.  About 80% of the way it crashed.  A few weeks later tried again, same results - crashed a 2nd time... ie. ended up having to reformat the drive.  I've given up.  Need to look into one of the solutions you've laid out.  
Need to read/study on why running a node connected to a hardware wallet makes it more secure.  If you have any online resources to explain the benefits of running a node with a hardware wallet (vs. hardware wallet alone) and how to do it - can you pls post it.  Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-26 04:16:05
Have you looked at WazirX?  No personal experience, but they are now owned by Binance, and have put up a few screen shots showing pricing in INR.  See this news link.
It could be a two step process - if the article is correct - buy USDT (Tether stable coin) via WazirX and then use the stable coin to buy BTC at Binance ... every step of the way, you may end up paying commissions.
Even at 10% price savings on 4BTC, maybe worth pressing your sister to do it.... ie. have her start the KYC process to open an account, and then give you the log in/password so you can go in and execute trades / withdraw to your hardware device.   
Even for people living in countries where BTC is allowed - it isnt always easy.  Banks can arbitrarily shut down accounts  for the flimsiest association to cryptos and no explanation given.  Your sister maybe reluctant since she's worried about that &amp;/or mass media labeling crypto as for speculating and black markets.
(See Bank of America shutting down Ex-PayPal CFO's account.  The irony PayPal is just as bad).
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:28:52
Thank you for taking the time.  Very helpful.
Once I have my node setup and running - is there a step by step resource that shows how to force my hardware wallet to route info through my node, instead of the wallets default?      
I saw that that BTC core has its own wallet built in, and assume this happens automatically for users of that wallet.
Sorry if the query is worded wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:33:01
Good to know why it keeps happening.  
Runs fine in every other way... like you said the defect seems to only get triggered by BTC dataset... at least for now.

BTC was invented exactly as a result of events like the one in Lebanon - ie. the last Global Financial Crisis.
You have two scenarios, BTC can be useful for you within Lebanon - if things get really bad even locally, people will want hard currency, goods or non devaluing assets. Read this from a poster in Venezuela - of a use case - [
Saifedean Ammous is from Lebanon (or based there), and travelling the globe educating people on Bitcoin. You may want to look for his book in Arabic. [
If you are able to buy bitcoin in Lebanon or elsewhere / withdraw it from the exchange and secure access on a hardware device, secure the passphrase (24 words).  It becomes portable, uncensorable, permissionless and transmittable.  Whoever you want to send it to, all they need is a BTC address (obtainable for free).  
If you want to leave the country with it - all you need is the passphrase - where ever in the world you land, you can use your password to access. 
Even if you decide to not take this further, suggest you buy a very small amount, withdraw it to a wallet (software wallet like Exodus, or more preferably a hardware wallet). Just doing that will put you ahead of the rest in terms of experience.  The process of withdrawing from the exchange and sending to yourself will show you how it is sendable from one address to another without a middleman.  Goodluck, we all need it.

Great, thanks a lot.  Very clear, better than anything I've seen by searching so far!  Have seen many references to connecting to the Electrum Wallet, without ever specifying why.  Really appreciate your help.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:22:12
Would really like to give this a go - really appreciate your gesture.
I've installed the Lightning app (unfunded wallet).  
1) Do I need to have a positive balance to be able to send you an invoice?
2) I have my receiving address.  
3) Is this what you need for the test invoice - lnbc82830n1pw3sxukpp5uuq4zwyd5ntc0pdc9yqkswlqd9zlx832z9ytsz0f8tn2mz4gt4tsdq523jhxapqf9h8vmmfvdjscqzpgxqy9gcqjqull0p6emut33ancsgu3tzaeh6fnqep7l0xy8h4denguqeuuv052ah5p2ygd2ccta7523he9l04qgechdlm0nn60zkqu4jxztywwccq33dyp7
4) How do I send it back to you?  Realize it wasnt your intent to collect it back.  
5) Can you raise an invoice to me?  Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:35:49
Here's an update -
1) Funds have arrived in my Lightning-App Wallet (LAW).
2) When I try to pay an invoice from Lightning App Wallet to my BlueWallet Lightning it says Lightning payment rejected.  Is that because I first need to deposit something in the BlueWallet **Bitcoin** Wallet?
3) When I try to raise an invoice from Lightning App Wallet, I get a warning that I dont have inbound capacity.  
Here's an ***invoice for 0.50c - from my Lightning App Wallet***.  For some reason my Lightning App Wallet only shows $$ and not sats.  Checked the settings and they seem set to Sats.
This is an ***invoice from my BlueWallet for 5000 sats***.
I'll go back and read all the links you sent, thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:12:52
Thanks again for your patience.
Trying to pay say 5000 sats from Lightning App-Wallet to Blue Wallet App (which has zero funds).  Just says Payment Failed.
Would it be because I need to first fund the Bitcoin Wallet in the BlueWallet App?  Currently my Blue Wallet has nothing in it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:58:38
Thx for confirming Blue Wallet
You may have hit the nail on the head - it shows 0% on Lighting.
Now trying to open channels.... it says autopilot feature of opening channels.
In the transaction log, some things seem to have been confirmed (green dots) - ie.. the incoming, as well as 3 or 4 outgoing for some of the times I tried to send to Blue Wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:21:10
Couldnt figure this one out - so had to do a search.
Seems like scammers call and trick people into going to the Bitcoin ATM, buying BTC and then giving their private key.  Most often the scammers are probably outside SGP.
Wherever there is a way, a scammer will play.
Here's a similar story from April.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:08:04
Thanks a lot, bear with me.  Here's what I did so far,
a) Sent a low fee, low value transaction from my main BTC wallet to the Lightning-App.  The rcvg address I used (&amp; quoted earlier) is what the Lightning-App itself generated - tab says deposit funds.  
b) I have had Blue Wallet for a while but unfunded.  BlueWallet makes things clear and says you need a lightning wallet and a separate Bitcoin Wallet.
c) Another question, after I fund my Lightning-App wallet - assume I can send Sats to my Blue Wallet App....and back to Lightning-App.  If that's the case, I dont need to bother you right? - ie. get to use it, send and rcv.
Really appreciate this learning opportunity.
Will look through all the other stuff you listed here.

This medium article is covered in the above post - a must read for you.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:05:50
\- Dont let the seed words enter any electronic realm.  No photographs / printing etc.
\- Consider keeping the handwritten passphrase secure - ideally in more than one physical location.
\- Add a passphrase/additional word in addition to the 24.  The 25th word is something you can memorize.  
\- Switch to a hardware wallet when possible.
\- Do a format / recovery test of a wallet/address in which you just have 0.0001 BTC... before loading it up with your full stash.
\- Among best practices is to not re-use receiving addresses, but at the same time, if you want say one address that you want to provide to depositors, almost inevitable to not re-use.  Maybe get a new one once in a while.
Others will add things like run a node, put your address on the watchlist etc.... but some of these things are easily suggested, harder to implement.  For the ultimate - look up Glacier Protocol ([ 
Good luck.
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:56:18
If your question is timing related - I'd buy at least 1 BTC to build a base holding, and then dollar cost average.
If you mean how much you should allocate to BTC - typically have seen recommendations of 1-5% of your net worth.  So, if that 100,000 is say 20% of your networth, you should be looking at around 15K or 2BTC.  
There are guys like A. Pompliano - who have 50% of their networth in BTC.  
Having high liquidity helps in that you'll be able to weather price fluctuations...
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:15:43
For the first part of your question, you may want to support a Bitcoin Core Contributor directly.  Luke Dash Jr is a name I've seen a lot.  His details - [
There maybe other Core Developers - this article may give you additional names- [
Square Crypto just supported a developer ([ who goes by that ID and is pseudonymous - [
Nakamoto Institute - does a lot to support Bitcoin Core - and can probably help guide you.  Also probably worthy of your support.  [
Good luck &amp; thanks.

Update: It says 0% on Lighting.  The color is red.  
I click on it - and it says "Opening Channels... autopilot feature " - stuck there for about 2 hrs+.
Looks like some minor tech issues - thank you for your initiative here.  If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't have come this far.  Will post on the r / lightning network and ask for some help there.
@_date: 2019-12-27 08:11:19
If you dont need to carry the engraved seed - 
1) Calling one or two parties in your destination and relaying say 40-50 words in random order could be an option.  Only you'd know the position order of the words.
2) You could also write a list of 50-60 words, make that available to yourself via the cloud (maybe a photo of a handwritten paper).  Again, only you'd know the validity &amp; position order of your words.
You need to come with up with your own code to recreate the seed from the 40 words... eg 1=12, 2=0 and so on...
Lastly, you may want to add a passphrase that is not engraved.  Just my 2 cents worth.
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:56:51
If Bitcoin only Cold Card wallet comes highly recommended.
If BTC and altcoins - Trezor &amp; Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X.
Great that you are moving it off exchange and a hardware wallet.  Just remember and look up everything written here about securing your 24 word seed, without letting it enter any electronic realm.  Also adding an additional passphrase.  
Lastly, may not be a bad idea to first load the wallet with say 0.001 BTC, then going through an wipe and recover test.
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:18:24
Most exchanges have a charge of 0.0005-0.001 BTC (about $3.5-$7 at current levels) each time you withdraw.
Worth doing it often enough so you dont leave too much BTC on the exchange at anytime - maybe every $2-300.
@_date: 2019-12-30 16:20:50
Thx for sharing.  Good you only bought $92 worth at the inflated price.  
Hopefully once the price climbs back over 8.5K - worst case next year this time - you can look back at it as a lesson learnt .  Hope things work out for your wife and your finances stabilize.
On one hand in trying to escape the predatory banking system..... if we're not careful, we'll have a new circus with different clowns.  It's this type of inflated pricing that makes spend/replace BTC easier said than done.  
Best wishes for a successful 2020.

Bitcoin exchanges (licensed by MOF) in Thailand - there are a number of others but these two come up,
[Coins.co.th](   (rated better on Google reviews)
[Bx.in.th]( 
Price fluctuates by the minute, but at the time I checked, \~161,600 per Bitcoin. or \~ USD 5080. 
I haven't bought from either of these exchanges, but for instance Kraken (Global exchange with more volume) is priced at around USD 5020.   Considering the f/x conversion rates the pricing is probably pretty close to global rates.
You can buy fractions - as low as 0.002BTC on some exchanges....or \~320 baht at current prices.
If you have traded stocks, the sites are laid out pretty much the same... bid/ask format.  You can place market and limit orders.  Once you buy some BTC, transfer it out to a wallet that you control.  If you have more than a few hundred dollars equivalent, but a Ledger Nano S or Trezor Hardware Wallet.  Both available locally.
There are plenty of wallets (software) which reside on your laptop, or even mobile phone.... but Hardware wallets are the way to go.
One of the biggest failure points has been cryptos lost on exchanges (exchange gets hacked, the founders do a runner etc)... so dont leave any coins on the exchange... in the long run.  
Hope this helps

You are on the right track... with your thinking.
1) Buy on exchanges, and transfer to your wallet.  Withdrawal fees on most exchanges are extremely reasonable now.  
2) I'd ignore desktop/mobile wallets.  For long term &amp; meaningful amounts go with hardware wallets like Trezor / Ledger.  Some others like OpenDime &amp; ColdCard.  Transfer a small amount - as low as 0.002 BTC... I'd even go so far as to reset the hardware device and restore it with my passphrase... just to make sure you can do it successfully before transferring larger amounts.
3) Storage of the keys, you can store the 24 word seed - say 12 in one location and the other 12 in another.  Or all at one place in a bank vault.  Steel plate with etched keys - have a look at products like this.  [  
You can also spread your holdings across multiple devices.... (OpenDime hardware device is as low as $10-15/pc).
4) For the ultimate in safety, I've heard the word Glacier Protocol thrown around.  That's extreme ownership..... not feasible for many of us.
5) You may also want to think about heirs/successors and how they can recover your funds - not just as an inheritance, but in the event someone else at your direction needs to help you get access to your funds.
