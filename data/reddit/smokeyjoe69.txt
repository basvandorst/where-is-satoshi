Actually it does equal that. The most significant indicator of whether you are in the 1% is age. 75% of families lose their wealth within the second generation after getting rich and 90% by the third generation then 95% by the end of that. Many people also are in the 1 Percent at some point within their life and then go in an out.

Its a little more nuanced than that but probably a lot for Christmas haha

The only thing Ive paid for with bitcoin is a miner. Obviously if it becomes as successful as we want then it will be used to pay for other things or  causes we like.

“Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” Frédéric Bastiat

Gold is also supposed to be a currency

Thats not really true. Wealthy people give a lot more to charity. Dont know about percentages. But I mean Carnegie Rockefeller, bill gates and then the tons of Americans who give every year. We also used to have a lot more charity and fraternities and organizations that served as support networks before the welfare state was used to concentrate political power. 
Also I'm just a poor young hodler. 
I gave 50 bucks to my friends eye surgery 20 bucks to this org for disabled kids, im actually handing out food there today as part of a wrok thing..ect. Just haven't donated anythin in Bitcoin just like I haven't bought a lot of stuff with bitcoin yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:42:15
haha was waiting for that. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:42:08
Agreed. I think its better than gold since the limited manufacturing use is not what gold gets value from but its properties that make it HODLable and trade able and divisible ect. 
1 and 4 are just a matter of increased adoption. 
1. Generally Accepted - Many people must accept the money as a settlement of debt or as a discharge of obligation.
2. Durable - Its quality/value does not deteriorate over time, which is why we do not tend to use food products as money.
3. Divisible - If you divide the money in half, each half should be worth 50% of the whole. This is why we tend not to use diamonds or artwork as money.
4. Stable/Consistent - The value does not fluctuate substantially with time.
5. Transportable - It is easy to move from one place to another.
6. Scarce - It is difficult to acquire."

I missed the your in that sentence I thought you were asking in general. None of my bitcoin, I have been hodling. But if I make money I'll be charitable. If bitcoin gets big a non inflationary currency alone will feel like charity for peoples savings vs having them diluted now.

You can pay taxes on it if you want. Eventually if crypto really becomes dominant and relies less on fiat exchanges it will be impossible to track so taxes will ultimately be up to people, and people are a lot more willing to put taxes onto other people but when it comes to themselves if there are no consequences they are less likely to pay them and can better use the money in other ways.

Do you know who Rand Paul is?
Ron Paul had a meme today on his facebook joking we should repeal the year 1913 so we could get rid of the income tax and federal reserve in one swoop haha
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:02:26
Sad. Wrong. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:32:34
It does matter because when things cost more it gets even harder to have enough to pay for them...
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:33:58
There is no discrepancy between productivity in wages. All those graphs leave out benefits which have increased relative to wages. Because companies have tax incentives encouraging them to pay in benefits rather than wages. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:30:50
Yes, how much you can buy depends on both cost and how much you have. So if consumer prices rise then your money doesnt go as far. It doesnt look like I'm the one with the reading problem.

I would rather neither. And we currently have too much of both, with or without Yang.

Hong Kong had the record for 7-11 density. They have 900 on the island. I had a friend who visited everyone and took a picture cause he's a weirdo.

If you are a coward with no values. Bitcoin was made for situations like this.

Didn't they start labeling anything under 10% inflation deflation?

Climate change skeptic not denier which maybe more people should be. Anti civil rights- are you talking about how his belief in the constitution and states rights was spun as anti civil rights? Definitely not a standard GOP candidate. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:30:03
I feel like he's certainly less hawkish than than majority of the GOP and evens lot of democrats including Hilary. He hasn't voted on all the military spending bills and would probable have handled Iran similar to Obama.

You know they have a currency monopoly right?
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:12:46
The central bank has a government granted currency monopoly. It is not a private market.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:01:36
You must be new.
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:11:47
You dont need a central bank to have a government. The US central bank was created in 1913. Our highest sustained growth periods happened before 1913.

I'm not pro fiat crypto. Just think it's a relevant development.
