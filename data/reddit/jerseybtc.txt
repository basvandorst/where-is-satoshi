im already on my second username here...pretty sure a 3rd is in the works.  they like to "ban" me.  ban is in quotes for very obvious reason.  banning a person from reddit is like the government banning crypto...aint happening

someone with sharp teeth? that sounds scary! when my friend is done crying in the corner i will ask him if he has seen any bears.  bears and vampires are scary!  he wrote a fairly articulate article on bots.  it made many people mad.

@_date: 2017-10-10 15:14:38

wide gap with pink in the middle?  sounds a bit sexual...
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:18:29
one minute graph brought to you by me;)
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:43:56
zero now.  100% on the dip and the fork is garbage.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:51:55
ohh wait..i missed a 0.  it was 700K
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:41:42
i think everyone should now trade using this graph.  also...i need to go sharpen my fangs
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:59:27
power is dictated by demand and wallets. its the end users who have all the power
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:03:19
why foks?  can't we use chopsticks instead.  I mean they are more "parallel" than forks, no?
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:23:08
from my experience until 2013 until now, i have to tell you this is 100% manipulation.  the manipulation agitates me to the point i have done some pretty serious things that have actually cost me a fair amount of money.   64bot and i have a well documented history and i researched it for some time.  that bot will never hit the fill line again.  that is my doing.  this coin will dip before the fork and will get right back to a new all ATH.  i will buy that dip.  i will sell that peak.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:30:12
i sold all my btc cuz i read my graphs wrong:(  
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:52:56
get your fangs out and bring your chalices 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:57:38
sigh...i don't want to get banned like he did...sigh:(
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:57:12

@_date: 2017-10-09 20:03:41

@_date: 2017-10-11 18:00:25

@_date: 2017-10-11 14:38:29

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:32:02

@_date: 2017-10-11 14:42:36

@_date: 2017-10-11 23:54:04

@_date: 2017-10-11 14:49:57
well not everyone can get it right all the time.  this time i am sure he is correct.  its going all the way to the basement cuz thats what happens after a doubletop
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:47:36
IDK I thin we should all follow these graphs.  i made a whole half a' BTC last time:)
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:42:05
cuz people who speak the truth unfiltered are pariah 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:56:35
drink it up 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:35:43
i think so!  he may have been banned and just spun up a new account...
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:41:28
its already on the exchange
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:18:03
leverage you coin as collateral for loans later..  never sell the actual coins.   
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:55:54
omg now i feel so validated. thanks;)
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:48:57
we all sell??? right??  please i am so new and took a loan for this
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:55:59
triple exchange dump
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:08:28
please understand reddit is simply a way for me to communicate with the manbun forkers.  i have zero fucks to give aside from them hearing me.  i assure you they hear me, have validated my transaction on the block chain as well as understood the more articulate things i have written.  fuck everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:17:10
any idea how much coin it takes to do that?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:51:56
its gonna crash like the bajesus..lol
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:00:45
100% there will be dips 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:42:39
omg i think i just found more in my underwear drawer?
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:11:48
a vampire came to me at night and told me that trading bots draw graphs and to always do the opposite of the graph.  I cried cuz i was ascared'.  then he bit me and turned me into a vampire.  now i stay up all night:(
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:06:53
you are hired.  be at work 5pm today.  bring mops, shop vac and some jars.  we will need to clean up the blood. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:46:13
i am referring to the future. in the interim, withdraw btc, pay bills and ensure you have stellar credit for the future.  financial leverage is the key to everything.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:39:22
he might have been!! he got banned though...and now all he does is cry in the corner of the reddit room;(
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:05:57
idk i think its called vervain?  a friend just left it on the nightstand along with the graph...
