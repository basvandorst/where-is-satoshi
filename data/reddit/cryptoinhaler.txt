Why would anyone want to use the 2x coin. Since now segwit is activated and lightning could be implemented to btc. For faster transactions i think this 2x is another scam like bcash. Nothing can kill the original
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:17:50
LOL SO TRUE

Lord of the strong hands
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:22:52
So how could this have happened. The only way to get compromised is if someone knows your seed and they never leave the device unless its by brute force or if you enter them online or your camera on your pc or phone glances at it  And your pin cant be broken into because the numbers are always changing externally and  the passphrase has to entered each time. How?!
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:55:34
I take it back. Sorry I did not read the full thread
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:24:59
Fuck off scammer stop changing your story
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:43:25
This is true ��
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:36:15
There isnt
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:19:54
Sure buddy keep shilling HEX
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:34:50
Someone knows your seed and also your pin because the attack was performed while you were sleeping. Thats the only other explanation. Also did you deposit your btc on your passphrase wallet or not
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:47:54
So this time around did to manually type in the website? Or do you have it bookmarked? From your previous uses?
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:15:28
It cant be sorry. Either you went on a phishing site or you leaked your keys or has to be user error
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:03:09
CONGRATS SIR
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:31:21
Same here i buy at any price
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:02:26
Ok so what your saying is you updated the firmware and now your btc is gone? Without no one knowing your seed and your passphrases got compromised too?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:57:54
Not particularly especially now when wallstreet is getting in 
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:53:31
You got hacked because this is a phishing site and entered your words on the browser. The wallet section is disconnected or leads you this step. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:13:21
What a bunch of scumbags

@_date: 2017-11-20 23:02:33

@_date: 2019-04-16 04:34:13
 whoever buys them can then use those cards to access a private key for an equivalent amount of bitcoin for the amount you paid. Ex 20$ 50$ 100$ cards
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:32:30
Yes like open dime except the bitcoin is already on it with the privkey. All I need to figure out is when “the cashier” scans it and someone pays for one thats when they get the funds. Because people can rob them obviously.
@_date: 2019-04-16 04:40:37
 just like how these guys did. To give you an idea
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:36:15
