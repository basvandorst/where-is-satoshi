Coinbase was trash one week in.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:07:04
You are a moron and apologist. If they are too stupid to prioritize a ticket from someone that made a $40,000 wire transfer over the guy that sent $5 of BTC or wants a new fucking account then they don't deserve to be in business.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:06:51
You are trying to excuse the inexcusable. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:20:15
Yeah, these idiots don't understand that $40,000 accounting errors are common and always take years to fix...
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:18:04
He didn't receive a response because Coinbase doesn't give a FUCK about replying. They have the resources to handle this shit better, they just don't care. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:12:57
You are a dumbass that has no clue how ticket systems should (and do) work. 
Coinbase could also hire enough help to sustain their growth. They are only able to thrive while being fucktarded due to lack of competition.

I support crypto but sanely. While we do need something that makes it easy to accept other currencies I find it way too early to try to educate people on all of them at once. They don't know the basics yet, telling them the ins and outs of even 5 currencies and how they are different is asking for trouble. For mass adoption Bitcoin needs support, almost all of it.

What the fuck is heavily overdrew? His account was $1200 negative and half was in bank fees. That could be one $600 check and calling that "heavily overdrawn" is really stretching.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:14:02
You are going to be a surprised mofo in a year. Also, moving coins back and forth between wallets counts as double the money spent right? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:34:29
Those questions are triggered by set volumes, possibly set by the company asking them on behalf of the government, and having a longer history is a bigger reason to ask them. That is what the laws cover, huge sums at once or over time.

You are talking about something completely different. Cash discounts were allowed going back at least 10 years and probably forever. What was not allowed was a **surcharge** for using a credit card. It appears that this was changed due to a recent lawsuit but has nothing to do with what I said.
@_date: 2014-06-10 23:52:55
I don't know what world you live in but things costs on the Internet are nothing compared to offline businesses. I would be comfortable launching this business with well under $10,000 and so would many others. You do **not** need $100,000 to start a business online.

@_date: 2014-06-30 23:33:26
You are completely ass backwards. There are **no** good reasons they would sell under and a lot of reasons they would sell at minimum for market value. I have seen sweet fuck all predicting BIT/SM would be a leader and at under market rate and I stay pretty in tune so I don't even know where you came up with that.
Whatever it was, your information is bunk.

Hmm, it's in the bottom section for me.

I'm just waiting on the relentless swarm of haters that latched onto this story even though the announcement pretty clearly said this shit was fine  to come back and say they were wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:59:57
There is no need to dramatize events. eBay does not allow the sale of currencies because it is illegal to facilitate the trade of said currencies. The same is true for Paypal.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:43:32
Yawn. With the amount of money going through the system there is no reason they can't have tellers that verify transactions on the fly. Sure instant would turn into within 30 seconds or so but it would also be the smartest way to handle this. You could even allow small transactions to go automatically while verifying everything over a set threshold. 
The problem is there was no money in this when these companies were started. There is enough cashflow and investment into these businesses now that they could get their shit together, like last month.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:07:56
Yep, go after some of the first people that would or at least should be aware of potential issues. Wonder how that would work out. My guess is MTGox would get hammered and the rest would see it a mile away and be fine.

To try to dictate how people donate their money or what charities choose to support makes you a dick.
We all get the point you are trying to make, you or someone like you makes it in every thread related to raising money for anything from a single person on reddit to a homeless charity in Florida or breast cancer awareness and everything in between.
Is it too hard for you to comprehend that what motivates people to support one cause or another is completely out of your control? Oh sure, you might make one person at a time "see the light" with the pretentious way you talk down to everyone but the overall effect will be nil. 
People get involved in charity for their own reasons, sometimes personal and sometimes just to do something good for others. People support these charities for the same reason. The fact that a million dollars does x here or y there gives you no right to talk shit to others based on what they support.
To use your argument against you, how much medicine would your Internet bill pay for if you just cut it off? If you get rid of your computer or opt for a cheaper one then how many can be helped? How much you spend on food, if you go to the movies, what shoes you buy and every other life decision should be run against how many kids won't  get medicine 100% due to your selfishness. I guess we could all be naked and sleep in grass huts instead of houses while we're at it, I mean who needs a house when there are people **dying**!
I hate to do this in charity threads of all places but you are being a dick and it should make you feel like a dick.

I love Bitcoin but these half assed solutions drive me up a wall. Bitcoin **might** be a good solution sometime way into the future but it's not even close right now. As soon as the exchanges get fully legal they will increase their fees to cover the costs and it will be even more expensive than it is currently.

So thank you, idiot.

Your experience is shit but a chargeback is as simple as a phone call for 99.9% of those in the USA.
You may have to fill out some forms but they are nothing. Online transactions are even easier because card not present verification is hard.
Source: I have processed credit cards for my businesses since 1999 including standard and high risk merchandise / services. I have also had to charge back certain items.
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:37:48
Just from my experience with talking to people about accepting Bitcoin they are scared to death about the 10 minute wait for confirmations. I can't get anyone to understand that yes, you can give them the coffee immediately because
a) It's going to confirm 99.9% of the time
b) It's a cup of coffee, just eat the $3 if something nutty happens.
I would imagine a webcam site is even more cautious because unlike a regular porn site most of that money goes to the people on cam.

Just as many didn't see the big picture with bitcoin these poor pups don't see the big picture with DOGE. I love them both, for different reasons but to pretend Dogecoin is for kids and Bitcoin is the legitimate serious one is hilarious. I would not be surprised if Dogecoin is the most active in everything in a year.

We deploy **fast** and hard. New features can always be added if you worry more about getting a new business profitable over writing "perfect" code. I will take what you call "shitty" but functional code today over awesome code tomorrow, make enough money for a complete rewrite and using the knowledge gained from having something online and actually running to make it better if a rewrite is needed.
Also, I've gotten decent enough code for extremely cheap but for the $2 rates it was mostly designers. I've had trouble with programmers at all price levels.

@_date: 2014-05-17 02:21:02
There is no way they are stupid enough to demo something to the tech crowd that shows no spread then have a spread on launch.
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:38:35
Dogecoin could die, but calling it a fad shows you don't understand anything about it. The community, the way it is being used, the excitement and many other things are unmatched by anything aside from Bitcoin. Darkcoin spam has no bearing on this and there is a reason the dozens of coins that tried to copy Dogecoin immediately after it launched have gone **nowhere**.
Seriously, if you so easily dismiss Dogecoin as a fad you have some reading to do. The community will soon outnumber Bitcoin, the excitement level is infinitely higher and the amount of things being done to involve the general masses are amazing. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:52:37

How about the fact that THEY DIDN'T STOP THE TRANSFER OF THE FUCKING COINS.
It's right up there in the OP, for you and anyone else to read. They stopped a fiat withdrawal, cited the reason why, gave a reason to fix it and regardless of what anyone here thinks this is standard KYC bullshit.

The definition of "intrinsic" is a bit different when used in the phrase "intrinsic value" when referring to securities and such.
One could say the intrinsic value of Bitcoin far surpasses the market value.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:45:44
There is no excuse to be this dumb while on the Internet. Cash advance fees are something credit card issuers do on their own, and they have every reason to do so. This has fuck all to do with Circle.
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:18:45
Size of the entire Bitcoin market, number of overall transactions, etc do not add u to all merchants seeing a 25% increase just from adding Bitcoin. Nothing else points to that either, like Overstock figures or the fact that they might have spent cash if BTC weren't an option.

@_date: 2014-06-16 12:44:37
This looks like a cash grab / self promo.
In your example you show a $400 bid to give the impression of potentially great deals. What makes you think that these coins will sell at a discount and if they did such a large one?
Coins often sell off exchange for **more** than market rates. Aside from that, anyone that bids and wins these coins is going to get some free press and a chance to tell the media what they aquired them for. They damn sure won't sell for $400 if valued at $600 elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:19:51

@_date: 2014-05-23 18:17:51
KYC compliance is a royal pain in the ass all around. They seem to want proof that he didn't steal multiple wallets and send it all to Bitstamp to withdraw, then let him take the coins out instead of cash.
None of this screams insolvency, in fact they are doing pretty much the opposite of what Gox did in trying to be compliant.
What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:32:01
On the fiat part, calling it fraud is one thing. Proving it's fraud is an entirely different story. What is actually fraud can often be blamed on incompetence and I assure you that his defense will be exactly that regardless of how true it is.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:51:04
No shit, Sherlock. The people bidding on these to win them aren't individuals trying to make a quick buck on doing what any idiot with a computer can do. They are bidding on the coins to **keep** them and have no interest in discussing how much they pay with you or anyone else.

Right, and screaming about how everything is going to explode in 100 threads does so much for image. This is far more damaging to Bitcoin itself. 
Did you know Overstock now accepts Bitcoin? If so, you are one of the few that found that through the noise here.

Now someone that earns tons of money off of Bitcoin is going to attempt double spends even though the odds of something working are virtually nil and the fact that if it did work they'd ruin their own damn business.

Dude, I'm sorry but you are just lost. There are several large companies, groups, funds, etc that have an immediate and ongoing need for Bitcoin. To buy them on the open market would drive the price much higher. Anyhow, I don't even see the point in discussing pricing in this auction when you don't even realize that the demand for a large number of Bitcoins in the first place.
If the common concensus in is that the coins would sell for under market and that BIT/SM would drive this price then is collectively dumb as fuck.

Hey now, we have a no refund policy at our B&amp;M store. If someone decides they don't want their purchase ($100 to $1000 range) we will put them in the store and sell them on consignment for $0 to get them their money back. What we won't do is sell something that is broken and drag the process out for 11 months. My point was this decision is not about revenue for us, it's about NO REFUNDS which has been our policy for almost a decade.

And your explanation states the absolute obvious. Did you really think people thought you could knock 24.75 BTC out of the hands of hundreds of people for .25 BTC? 
You act like this isn't a huge deal. If spending 1 BTC costs others 100 BTC that is a huge deal, it is still 100 BTC missing regardless of how many people it would have been split with.

They try to claim the payment provider exemption. That would be fine, if they let you accept payments and pull it to your bank and ended it there. Instead they operate as a full wallet letting you send and receive funds to any address and from any address. They also let you buy and sell Bitcoin on the open market at any time.
Compare this to BitPay that only allows you to sell things in Bitcoin and transfers whatever percentage of USD you chose to have converted to your bank automatically. The only reason you can add funds to BitPay without selling something is to process refunds.

KYC does not require you to confiscate shit and these coins weren't taken. A withdrawal in fiat was put on hold and the coins were left there. I came to Bitcoin because so many smart people were involved but damn there are a lot of reactionary idiots around as well.

Now how much money do you think they have leftover from them?
I think you are overestimating on both counts. A lot of people that spend 20k on something and get a chance to play with it for months will have buyers remorse if you offer to make them whole and erase their miscalculations on profit etc. Robocoin will be inundated regardless of whether or not the shit works and there is no way they can refund everyone that wants a refund after something like that.

30,000 coins will not have any real effect on price. The reaction to 30,000 coins being sold may have an effect on price, but only because people are idiots. How many coins are mined per day again?

You have shown that you have no rational thought processes, worse than bad comprehension and aren't afraid to make statements based on the information you've pulled out of your ass as if your idiotic assumptions are the way things are.
Here's a hint for you, it would cost around $900 per Bitcoin if you tried to buy this much on exchanges. If you think most bids were $400 to $500 then you are a dumb sack of shit as originally thought. Pretty much everything you've said so far is so devoid of logic that it hurts my brain trying to come up with anything resembling a proper reply since I know you won't understand what is said anyhow.

@_date: 2014-01-10 16:21:51
Haven't studied that exact part of it but I do believe I read somewhere that mining bitcoin and sending it to an exchange for cash is covered under the regulations. 
Anyhow, they simply said it was high risk which means they probably had issues in the past. Probably from all of that, you know, preselling shit that went on with miners. eBay can stop you from selling whatever they decide for the most part, DVD inserts come to mind, and PS4 boxes.
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:03:41

@_date: 2014-05-07 13:36:46
How in the world do you claim "one complex issue"?
If there are no regulations then there would be thousands of potential complex issues to deal with. You are wanting to take on the burden that is shared by tens of thousands of people around the world and act like you can handle those burdens when you yourself were taken by the obviously horrible MtGOX.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:14:16
No, no it would not. Anyone wanting to buy 3,000 to 30,000 coins would move the market quite a bit which would cost them more money anyhow. There is a reason large sums of BTC are often sold off the chain and for **more** than the current market rate. 
You are arguing against fact, reason, common sense and all kinds of other things. The only reasons this might not happen are that the buyers don't want the government to know they hold that much BTC. It damn sure isn't for what I assume you mean which is "nobody is paying more than market!"
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:11:36
This shit happens in big business, especially in new tech fields. What I said is that even those that never planned on asking for a refund will now be requesting one because they think they can.
You spend $20,000 on an ATM and make $50 per month it's not the fault of the ATM provider but you can be damn sure the people that paid it would take their $20,000 back if given the chance. Robocoin is either going to go "NO REFUNDS" as policy no matter what or close down thanks to this idiocy. Maybe they deserve it, I try to reserve judgment on such serious things since I don't know shit about shit really.

A couple of things. The history of the founder suggests competence would be the first.
But more importantly, this isn't some random person on kickstarter making promises. A lot of things point to legitimacy.
* Putting in the effort to launch long ago and taking their time with it.
* Registering a high end domain name that is brandable for the purpose.
* Finding credit card processing for Bitcoin which is not a simple task.
* Claiming no fees to a tech savvy crowd.
* Putting together a video to demonstrate the ease of use **before** launch.
* Claiming to offer $10 free to those who sign up (at some point).
Call it a gut feeling if it makes you feel better but all indicators point to a VC funded company with plenty of money that is willing to use either alternate monetization or just stay free for years in order to gain market share.
If I'm wrong so be it but I'd bet a bit that I'm not.

@_date: 2014-05-25 11:50:32
It's not magic. If you remove something that at least some people want from the marketplace the price goes up. Since Bitcoin is limited this is extremely easy to do, the volume on current exchanges is pocket change to some. 
There are way more factors in what the price does after you buy all available coin than "sell it and lose all those mad gainz bro!" Since I have no interest in a multi day conversation touching on all of those factors I suggest you look up how and why every other market on earth is manipulated and the reasons why .

The **first** address the stolen coins hit was an exchange address. If you haven't noticed they always separate and rejoin coins, it's part of their algorithm. They do this because of the problems with sending large transactions all in one shot. 
Your hero sat there for days pissing coins down a rabbit hole, ignoring every bit of sane advice he received and quietly disappeared once someone pointed out that the addresses belonged to an exchange. The fucking idiot thought someone was trying to tumble the coins "but they are only tumbling with themselves" ahahhaa. It was a sad, pathetic display and you should brush up.

ATMs used to cost $30,000 to $150,000 and up. The fees you charged on them were $2 per transaction. If they can make that work, and many independent companies do, then so can Bitcoin businesses.

It's just ridiculous. People  chased the Sheep coins around and around and around even tagging any wallets they hit as owned by thieves.

There is no way he offered that for 30,000 coins so you must mean all of them including the bigger wallet. If so, why **wouldn't** he buy them for that much since it's below market value?
In fact, I will buy the 144,000 coins for $85 million and hopefully I'm the high bidder.

As for double spending at merchants, show me one.

I have been friends with / worked with (internet stuff, not hooking) multiple escorts, none of which charged $1000 an hour and none of them took money up front. In a couple of cases the client would put an envelope (of money hopefully!) on the nightstand or desk beforehand but most of them just collected after the fact. That way they could go over time if requested without being an asshat and stopping to top up the payment and wouldn't have to worry about discussing prices with a cop. If they fuck you it's obviously not a cop.
I don't know what experience you have with hookers but I can't imagine very many that aren't working out of some shady hotel with a pimp in the next room or walking the streets waiting on their next fix collecting up front.

At this very moment everyone operating in the US is screwed. I love Coinbase but they have a silly disclaimer up that says they are using the payment provider exemption. That would be awesome, except that they allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin which kind of throws a wrench in that argument.
BitPay on the other hand will only allow you to send them Bitcoin to refund customers. I think they have a much better chance of sticking around long term if the government decides to really crack down.

You talk like I'm sitting on billions of DOGE or something, I'm not. I think it was overpriced from the start, given how many Dogecoins were available and the number being mined per day.

I already told you that there are intermediaries willing to look the other way for enough money or that operate in friendlier territories. You could / can? fund poker sites for credit cards even though it was explicity disallowed by the government. What you don't see is the multiple processors they go through to keep things running for so long because one will assume the risk until they make a few million then "find the abuse" during an audit when they no longer want to press the issue.
Selling Bitcoin for anything automatically makes you a money transmitter according to US regulations. You will find that only the most established money transmitters will allow you to trade credit card numbers for something else that can be "spent" or is a financial instrument. Ever tried to fund a stock trading account with credit? 
And again, you are welcome to call up every third party processor, IPSP, etc and ask them for yourself. You will find the same answers I have over the last many years, **it is not allowed**.
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:20:59
It was a rhetorical question. I am not going into a huge conversation about it but here is a very simple rebuttal.
People can be smart enough to vote for someone that will protect their interests, backed with funds from the government to do so, but not know every intricate detail of how Bitcoin works and all of the possible ways to look into a company to see if they might get scammed. They damn sure don't have the authority to do anything about it after the fact. I wonder who does?

Not sure if $800-$900 is in line but I would definitely wager they sell for over the "market" rate. In Bitcoinland the market rate advertised isn't really the market rate anyhow, it's the market rate of a few exchanges based on buy and sell orders on those exchanges only.

I don't think **you** know how to slow your brain down and process this ridiculous information. When you provide something concrete that I should worry about I promise I will worry. Until then I'm going to hold my coins and ignore the FUD.

It's mostly used for open public shows, tip based so btc would fit right in if implemented correctly, but the standard Americanized rates for private. $2 - $5 per minute usually. Really no need to go private unless you value your alone time.

This is such crap. They would have to be deposited **anywhere** that lets you withdraw to a new address. Dice sites, other exchanges, whatever.

No, but what has running around crying wolf accomplished so far? 
And if you're going to cry wolf at least describe the wolf for what it is, you don't have to say it's the wold that is 10000 times bigger than a normal wolf and it's going to breathe fire and end the world if we don't act immediately!
The odds of someone being so completely moronic to destroy Bitcoin when they have a huge stake in it but smart enough to run a very large pool and related companies is virtually nil.
The effects of someone having 51% hash power are being overblown.
The effects of someone having 51% hash power and trying to attack the network are being overblown.
Even if all of the evil stars aligned and we had some evil people wanting to do evil things and they got the power they wanted and they were stupid enough to use it the effects would be what exactly? They double spend a few coins but lose more in the process? They fork and run their own chain that no other miners agree is the real one so all of their coins are worthless? 
What exactly, something real please.
The market is self correcting, for reasons, and it will correct itself with this as well. I mean a hint of some kind of attack and every person in the pool that doesn't want to bankrupt themselves is going to do something about it. Other people will go into action too, miners and individuals hell bent on justice.
I am not concerned. I am not an expert but nobody crying doom and gloom has given me one legitimate reason to be concerned yet.

You are a certified idiot. Everyone knows full well what is holding back mass adoption and until recently mass adoption in the near future wasn't even discussed seriously. Hell, the number of transactions that can be processed on the chain isn't even suffice for mass adoption **right now**. You act like you are making some huge revelation when this shit is known.


Oh I'm sorry, when an idiot says "I sincerely look forward to seeing your magical startup that will solve all adoption problems." I assume they mean me since that is exactly what was said.
So now that you've clarified that you only meant the startup I mentioned it's even more of an idiotic statement. Why? Because you were being a sarcastic dipshit by calling it some "magical" solution as if it's some pie in the sky idea. It's not, it is expected and it will come about. Not only is it common sense it is one of the things that has been discussed forever and a day now as how things will go.


No, saying Paypal jumped on the credit card wagon isn't even close to your Ford analogy. Paypal offers **third party** processing for anyone, something that was a royal pain in the ass before them. I made no claim that they were the first to offer processing which is obvious to anyone with a modicum of common sense. It is literally the exact thing this discussion was about.


Darn, you are dumb and pretentious. I am never riled up from the Internet, I expect idiots like you like I expect the sun to rise. I simply respond to willful ignorance with willful dismissal.

Understood, but that's a bit different than 


Also, the person that posted this went on to say 


Those statements contradict each other. I took it to mean that sending useless work to the pool must somehow be easier than actual mining and that taking a small cut due to less blocks was made up by getting a big enough share to more than offset that.
If the purpose is 100% to destroy a pool that makes sense but it's definitely not for "no profit" and I don't know enough about mining or block withholding to decide if it's beneficial to "steal" as they keep saying.

You said to show you somebody that processed Bitcoin for credit cards. I told you why others don't. How about this, you go ahead and phone up any 3rd party processor, Paypal and anyone else you want to and ask them about accepting credit cards for Crypto. **It is against their rules and this is why nobody does it.**
I have spoken to a dozen or more IPSP's, third party processors and even prepaid debit card providers about this, I'm not talking out of my ass.
I have a decade + of experience in high risk processing and I am telling you that figuring out the fraud is the easy part **but nobody will let you process credit cards for Bitcoin** and the few that have ended those arrangements soon after. It would put their entire business at risk of getting slapped by the feds.

There are processors that allow it, and they are either in a completely different territory (see NOT THE USA) or they will be forced to stop by their banks as soon as they catch on. 
Money can get you a lot of things, but Visa, MC, etc always get their way in the end.
Your theory does not hold water because they ban this both directions. You cannot, without lying, set up a co-branded or custom label prepaid debit card if you allow Bitcoin as a funding option. Now tell me, how in the hell would someone charge back a Bitcoin load? They wouldn't, but you still can't do it even if you slap $500,000 on the table up front.
You keep talking about avoiding KYC &amp; AML laws but I have never suggested anyone should try this. It would be fucking suicide since those regulations are required for any business of this type regardless of cash, bitcoin, gold or whatever else.
What I keep trying to explain to you is that someone would assume the chargeback risks to accept credit cards for bitcoin **immediately** if they could. Hell, I would do it my fucking self! Unfortunately you **are not allowed to process these kinds of transactions** and that goes all the way up the chain.
I have known of companies working around similar rules that had hundreds of merchant accounts as backup. To them they were interchangeable because getting their account pulled was a known inevitability. Nobody has been that proactive in the Bitcoin space yet and I doubt they ever will be.

Buying bitcoin is not taxed. It does not matter how you get money into bitcoin because it's a non issue as far as taxes go. You might put it in through an exchange, sell goods, provide a service or scam someone. 
Today, even in it's infancy, I can do the following with Bitcoin.
- Buy all of my groceries and household goods without the government knowing a damn thing.
- Buy all of my Christmas presents without the government knowing a damn thing.
- Buy gift cards that I can use for thousands of items in dozens of stores.
- Sell any of the above for cash on Craigslist or in person.
- Sell Bitcoin for cash in person.
- Any other fucking thing I want to do.
So you tell me how the government will know to tax a damn thing if I provide services this year for $100,000, do all of my shopping with Bitcoin and never pull out cash via "standard" means. They can't.

Hell no. The ones that do understand will be happy to play along and keep the price inflated.

So you seriously can't imagine a scenario where "the bitcoins are gone"? Really? lol
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:37:24


You really think so? I'd say the bullshit run up on the price sped up adoption by well over a year so any delays would still be a net plus.

If Circle is backed by who they say it is then it is neither vaporware nor does it face an uphill battle. Paypal exploded when they decided to give everyone $10 and then $10 for referring a friend to get their own $10 free. Everyone will be claiming their free money and being introduced to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:46:58
And some really weird ones!
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:24:20
Like when customers steal shit, claim their drink is bad and not pay, etc?
Any merchant waiting on confirmation to sell a drink is a dumb fucking merchant.

Why would **he** do this?
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:51:28
He already said as much in an interview weeks ago.
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:12:06


Your bank has a much better chance of "knowing their customer" than someone taking Bitcoin and converting it to USD.


@_date: 2014-09-27 20:07:27
Thank you for the suggestion, will try it.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:20:09
When I get on a work binge I really don't like to leave my house. I have overdrafted my account several times just because I didn't want to ride 30 minutes into town to make a deposit or I forgot when something was coming out. I can easily imagine getting in a bind and relying on their overdraft services to get by for a week or ten if needed.
It's such a scam anyhow. They could have bounced the payment if they really wanted to, but no, they'd prefer to charge you $35 twice and use those fees to cause a chain reaction of more fees. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:47:10
Find a rep and suggest it. :)
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:07:36
What difference does that make? Are you a bitcoin troll bravo? I think you are!
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:34:03
You see, GHash has a lot of mining power and a pool where others join and add theirs to the mix.
Many here are scared shitless that GHash will for starters decide to do evil things. Never mind that this would tank Bitcoin and wipe out the millions they have invested into equipment. Also never mind that those in the pool might not want this to happen and would leave at the first sign of real trouble.
They are also scared shitless that someone will put a gun to the head of someone in charge at GHash and make him do evil things. I guess if tanking Bitcoin is the goal then breaking the law by attempting murder is so worth it to destroy Bitcoin. I guess you could say they might do it for financial gain which brings back up the problem of deleting the value of the exact thing you are attempting to steal lots of. It also ignores the miners in the pool that might want to keep making money and remove their hash power from GHash.
In short, some of us can't figure out what everyone here is going on and on and on and on and on and on about even though we have looked into it. A lot.
tl;dr: People are scary (slang definition).

Coinbase are the idiots that take a week to take money from your bank. With Circle I made a purchase using my bank on Friday night at 10pm and it cleared Monday morning as soon as my bank opened. 
Coinbase won't take my Mastercard. 
Coinbase has other problems that I don't care to discuss here.

OP, if you think the only people that will know about this are old timers you are severely mistaken. I just got off the phone with 4 friends that have been wanting to play around with Bitcoin and they have all made purchases already. 
The "It's Happening" gif has never been more relevant.

It's just that those idiots are hiding. Anyone that thought Circle was vaporware given the info they let out and the person behind it is and was a fucking moron.

@_date: 2014-05-24 15:36:02
Do you know how fucking stupid you have to be to make that comment in this context? BTC has never dropped in half? The price per USD is no indicator of anything mentioned in this thread. It might be an indicator to various other things but fad status is not one of them.
Has the dumb side of the Internet really infiltrated Bitcoin this fast? It was mere **months** ago that most here were smarter than average and now I see a constant stream of the kind of stupid you have displayed.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:30:07
Not a single motherfucker dealing with bitcoin has a money transmitter license.

The figures quoted to become fully compliant stateside have been in the millions. True or not, that is only for the USA, then you have to worry with every other place in the world. 
Anyhow, I agree that it will end up cheaper for this particular use but don't think there will be as big of a difference as people hope. Now when everyone has BTC and can send it to whoever for pennies it's a different story.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:32:03
It won't be surprising if they sell at over market rate.

Every time I see someone complain about accepting Bitcoin but not seeing great results the impression I get is that they expected free money simply for accepting Bitcoin. It's not a magic bullet, you either hype your product a certain way (this works for USD based business on reddit too) or have something people already want to buy.
Why should I buy your book when you are rolling your eyes at me?

@_date: 2014-01-09 12:18:03
You're right. GHash is going to get to 51%, mine all the blocks, run BTC to $0.0000000000000000000001 and go broke in the process. Sounds like a plan Cotton!
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:40:27

@_date: 2014-02-02 19:27:23
I am fully aware of them and see no reason the system has to be developed in that way. If you are as careful with the keys as you would be with your cold wallet then you should leave their balances in a unique wallet until it is removed. Need to confirm that the balance matches the database entry? Check the wallet ID. If they match continue and if not upgrade to auditing.

Come on man, use some common sense. The statement "there are no more sellers" does not mean that there are **literally** 0 people selling Bitcoin. In fact, I would consider the miners as a given, the amount of coin hitting the market as built in and dismiss it completely. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:02:49
Please see the following.
Those are off the top of my head. They all took millions of dollars from hardworking people and suffered no ill effects. There are others.
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:11:08
The only reason it doesn't make sense is because you are a fucking idiot. Overstock saw unexpected growth in 2013 (you know, the last year that passed) while your statements are backed up by stupid ass comments like "How often do you shop there?" as if my personal shopping habits make a flying fuck.
Then to top it off you are so fucking stupid that in reply to me telling you that they are a public company you pull out this gem..


Sorry dumbass, this is your opinion against verifiable fact.
You know, when you get presented with information that should make you go "oh" and instead double down on the idiotic behavior it makes you one of the worst kind of people, the kind that doesn't give a shit how stupid they are.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:31:56
MtGox most likely fleeced everyone possible to fund an incompetent owners expenditures and had no similar statement they could make. They started adding fuel to the fire of blaming someone else and if it plays out like every other I've seen go through this they will crank up that blame in the near future before shuttering the site.
Just my opinion of course. They are probably looking for someone to bail them out as we speak.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:22:47
Oh horseshit. You are technically correct but this is nothing even remotely close to a machine taking dollars and spitting out Euros or similar.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:42:26

To all of the FUD spreading, over reacting morons the price of Bitcoin is nosediving because of your actions. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY?
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:44:36
So their goal is to destroy Bitcoin.
They attack, miners leave, they can't do shit, Bitcoin goes on.
That's what would happen but let's ignore that.
They attack, they get everyone's recent coins (evil laugh) everyone else decides they don't want to be robbed so they revert to the correct chain (DOGE split recently and had to fix this btw) and the coins that they got from the wrong chain are nonexistent, unrecognized, unspendable, worthless and Bitcoin goes on.
Unless you know something I don't and can actually explain it this is a non issue. I guess they could buy some fucking coffee using merchants that delivery coffee instantly with no verifications and perhaps scam someone on the street out of $5000 for some BTC but that will last all of a blink of an eye.
Forgive me for not shaking in my panties.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:59:37
The other alternative is that they are completely unhinged and don't know how to run a business. I find that less plausible.
@_date: 2014-06-16 13:29:25

@_date: 2014-10-07 12:53:20

To say that would be the very top is to say that Bitcoin isn't successful.

How many times do I have to tell your stupid ass that I buy DOGE to spend? 
So which is it, are you really as stupid as you present yourself or is this all a long term troll?
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:39:54
Overtake in what way? If you mean number of users, number of transactions, number of services or things like that then to you I say that you better buckle your seatbelt.

Yes it is, as discussed by multiple people in this very thread. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:50:45
Wow, look at that transaction from that anonymous wallet to that other anonymous wallet! Oh look, they deposited it in just-dice.com.

@_date: 2014-01-14 09:56:29
People answered your fucking questions, you are playing games.
1) You don't have to take all of your money in BTC. Are you too stupid to grasp that people might want to get paid all or part in BTC? You know, the same people that would go buy it anyhow?
2) You said that you can't pay for __________ with BTC and someone told you how you can pay for some of that with BTC. There is no further argument here, it has nothing to do with your original point and you can pick up your straw man and go the fuck home.
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:18:04
Oh darn, I deposited all that money into Just-Dice and removed it via a clean address. Woe is me.

Surely that will stop you from speaking out about them in public. Brilliant strategy.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:14:53
Again, are you really that shortsighted? There was no easy way to deal with credit cards online until Paypal showed up and there **will** be similar for Bitcoin. I have zero interest in starting something for this and that is irrelevant. Bitcoin is in it's infancy, Paypal jumped on the bandwagon a long fucking time after credit cards were first used.
And what the fuck is this calm down? How in the hell does anyone read that I'm not calm from a very short, very concise statement of fact?

@_date: 2017-03-02 19:01:18
I've had over 6 figures of Bitcoin at one time and have been in love with the idea of it since I heard about it. I'm laughing at the absurdity of a group of people wanting this to be some serious shit when exchanges have graphics like it's a fucking monster truck rally. I guess there was that one legitimate company run by the French weaboo to lend some credibility. Or maybe Coinbase, the company that claims to sell you Bitcoin instantly but cancels every order that doesn't go their way.
We are at the point that this ridiculous shit should not come up but here we are.

Uh yes. With Paypal you send USD to pay for things in USD. People liken it to a bank and / or credit card processor of which there are dozens.
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:04:16
There is no good reason. The arguments against brigading make those opposed to it vocally look like a bunch of butthurt crybabies.
You are literally complaining about people voting on comments or posts on a site that revolves around that exact concept. Linking to something a group of people would disagree with is no different than posting your circle jerk shit in a dedicated subreddit that most would agree with. I still use reddit the original and best way and because regular old voting is discouraged there is a pile of garbage on 24/7 since every idiotic link is in a section that circle jerks for that topic specifically. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:51:24

Honestly, who gives a fuck? This entire crusade against "brigading" is more fucktarded than brigading. why do you care if people comment or vote on a 4 day old thread? Everyone finds content in their own way. Some are linked, some see it on the home page, some are subscribed and some are linked from another sub. Just because users from one of those places disagrees with you vehemently does not mean they should be silenced.

That sounds about right to me. There are a lot of clueless people in this thread. If you get your own merchant account you not only pay a fine for every chargeback but they take it right out of your bank. If you go over some very tiny threshold (1-3% in most industries) then you can actually be subject to fines that can go up in to the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Further, you are 100% responsible for your own fraud protection. All that nifty stuff Paypal does to reduce chargebacks is on you. This is why people use third party services, even with their own merchant account. IPSP's / Paypal have their main account and put everyone in a basket underneath that so the collective % of chargebacks is easier to manage. 
With **any** merchant account it is very hard to win a dispute on a card not present transaction which covers all online services. That is why you typically lose by default. Paypal has their own dispute process to further reduce chargebacks for the reasons given above but they can't make it any easier to win these chargebacks because the loser would then charge back anyhow. Seller protection is not available on digital goods for this very reason and that is true anywhere worth their salt.
What I find interesting is that refunds have been a cost of doing business since forever. I deal with idiots every single day on goods that are covered and I still refund customers when requested. It's just good business.

That is not stealing your money, period. That is what happens on unauthorized charges, real or not, once the bank decides to reverse the funds. Or did your stupid ass think Paypal should eat the refund for you even though it's out of their control? 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:29:03
I'm sorry you are too stupid to understand that you don't know shit about the subject you chose to discuss as an expert. I have been processing high risk since the late 90's and have used every kind of payment processor around taking everything from phone bill payments to dialers to electronic checks to credit cards to Bitcoin / Dogecoin / etc. I have been with Paypal since x.com and they are by far one of the best third party processors available. They do not "steal money" and their fees are some of the lowest in the industry.
Get fucking bent, chump.

Chargebacks are part of taking credit cards, paypal minimizes these issues for you.
@_date: 2016-11-01 14:44:56
Please just stop. 
First of all, putting all processing in a basket lowers your risk immensely because they take the burden of scrubbing, fraud prevention and similar out of your hands. You are not responsible for the huge potential fines at all since it is their merchant account.
Further, by allowing payments via balance and bank there is zero risk of an actual chargeback on those transactions. 
I have been a Paypal user since it was X.com and have spoken to them thousands of times. The CEO solved my first issue with them way back. You are absolutely clueless about how they operate or payment processing in general.

I'm one of the 7 people online that you will never offend with words. As long as I can reply I'm good.
Husband isn't weak but he isn't super strong either. He has a lot of weird things that it's hard to find literature / studies on and it intrigues me. He has fluctuated between 167 and 172 pounds for around 25 years. The 172 is when he is working out often and gets more muscle tone. His "fat" is a tiny bit of softness over his 6 pack on his stomach. He has never tried to get super strong lifting weights and such so no idea if he'd hit the same ceiling but going from out of shape to in shape is about a week or so of manual labor. 
I do know he never quits fidgeting and saw that study that came out recently but that is only supposed to account for a few hundred calories. I think he's burning calories in his damn sleep or something. 
And then October hits and his 18 to 20 hour days of being awake / working turn into 12 hours half awake and deadly tired after in winter months. Certain foods knock him stupid as well. 
It interests me but you won't find a real conversation about any of it online because nobody believes it.

I have been involved in these discussions on reddit for 10 years. I have seen literally **every** argument that it is impossible that could be made and it's why when he was eating out every day due to time constraints that I tracked it. I had told people about his stint eating 6000 calories a day from McDonald's only and they called me a liar then so I tracked.
But let's say he's not digesting it and it's a medical condition. The statement "can eat 6000 calories a day for months and not gain weight" still does not make me a liar / stupid / misinformed / etc.
And he checks out healthy when he goes and doesn't do this all the time. He obviously burns calories faster than most, at least during the summer. From Oct until Feb he eats far less and sleeps far more.

There are people playing games and manipulating everything at this point. The casuals that are in Bitcoin are there because they at least have the illusion that it's easy to use.

I tracked his calories at two points in life, when he was 18 and again in 2010/2011. 6000 calories per day on average for a stretch of 3+ months both times. He works 18 to 20 hours a day and 7 days per week in the spring and summer months, barely eats in the winter. He has that fidget gene shit and never stops shaking his leg or similar.
You and 50,000 other people can keep calling everyone that doesn't fit into your worldview misinformed but it is you that is missing useful data. I know one other guy that is skinny to an unhealthy degree and you will never catch him without food in his hand. I don't count his calories but he eats all fucking day, every day. To pretend there are no outliers is extremely foolish.
When my husband was active in high school (football, etc) he ate breakfast before school, lunch at school, snacks throughout the school day, a meal when he got home, a meal when his parents cooked supper and a meal before bed. The meals he ate were real food so not fast food and such but still more than you and the other naysayers here would say is possible.
The most recent 6,000+ calories per day were things like 
Breakfast - Deluxe Breakfast from McDonalds @ 1219 calories. 
Lunch - Grilled Chicken Salad From Waffle House @ 100? calories. 
Lunch - 10 packages of ranch dressing @ 2300 calories. 
Dinner - Various fast food meals from McDonalds, sit down chinese restaurants etc @ 800 to 1500 calories or more.
So going by 800 calories at dinner and ignoring the occasional candy bar, etc we are at 4419 calories.
He drank two 2 liter cokes per day during this time. I could be an idiot but that is 1680 calories in my silly girl math bringing us to 6099 calories. He didn't lick his plates clean so I'm sure there were 99 calories in dressing leftover. 
Every single day for over 3 months without an ounce of extra weight.

@_date: 2016-10-31 20:58:00

Oh yes, what Bill Gates and Warren Buffet push back and forth to each other is so much more important than millions sending a lower amount.

$20 is nearly the lowest fee for a chargeback I've heard of. Go get you a merchant account, pay $30 or $35 for chargebacks and $10,000 fines (Paypal has to worry with these instead of members) and be responsible for your own fraud protection / scrubbing. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:44:04

They would take into account a sizable increase in value when writing the policy, and it would be included in the contract. That could be public information. 
Also, they would also make extra money on insurance payments while the value was dropping.
Moreover, even if it was a problem they could charge a daily interest rate based on the total held at that very day.
In any case, it could easily be figured out right now.

I don't think this is entirely accurate. A lot of the founders see to have been in this for other reasons besides monetary. They were very principled and don't seem to mind holding onto their coins.

No no, this was 10+ years ago. I handed the clerk in a computer store my check and they ran it through a scan machine similar to those used at Walmart and such. I was handed the check back immediately and when I asked why was told it was approved and debited already. I called my bank and sure enough that was the case.
Edit: It was similar to [this]( Either I was misinformed **and** somehow that check cleared my bank by the time I got home, something changed or they quit clearing them instantly.

"The three administrative rulings on which the payment processor exemption is based all involved arrangements through a clearance and settlement system intermediating solely between BSA regulated institutions (specifically, the ACH system). This circumstance was a significant factor in FinCEN’s ultimate decision in these rulings. While not limited to any specific clearance system, the intent and regulatory context of the previous rulings’ make clear that for the exemption to apply the entity must use a “clearance and settlement system” that intermediates “solely between BSA regulated institutions.”10 Examples of such systems include “the Fedwire system, electronic funds transfer networks, certain registered clearing agencies regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission … and derivative clearing organizations, or other clearinghouse arrangements established by a financial agency or institution.”11"

Hi newbie, the third party platforms instantly convert btc to cash if you want. Amazon would probably do something like that to start but if not it wouldn't really matter. If a company the size of Amazon incorporated bitcoin it would be worth more and more in the immediate future as the utility of bitcoin will have increased exponentially. More bitcoin users &gt; more people buying bitcoin &gt; more legitimacy &gt; more value.

For widespread adoption to happen there are going to be a lot of idealistic  people very angry at what has to happen. A user friendly bank is going to happen if bitcoins stick around, and it is going to benefit bitcoin overall. In fact, a lot of things the vocal early adopters don't like will need to be commonplace.

As expected, you are a doomsday preaching, hating ass, head in the sand idiot. No history needs to be rewritten. Poker sites did not get shut down for operating in the USA, they got shut down for how they circumvented banking laws to get money into their sites. A big bad poker player like yourself should be familiar and if not you can look it up.
There are still poker sites that take US players. How? They didn't get caught breaking these same laws. There is also a bitcoin poker site that can **not** be shut down, by design.
If you want to preach doom and gloom then by all means continue, but I will continue to call out your utter stupidity if and when I see it. If you were a neutral observer you wouldn't ignore facts, you would use your head and understand that this is exactly what bitcoin is useful for.

I would be surprised if **any** bitcoin exchange or similar is compliant in the USA. It puts them and all of their customers at risk.

Whether it lives or dies the comparison you made and information you used to form your opinions are utterly ridiculous. 
I personally use bitcoin for things I could not easily do without it. That is all. I am not sitting on hundreds of coins as a speculator and I am not predicting $50,000 coins. I am using it, as intended, and I'm smart enough to see the benefits.

I did not suppose I could bet higher than the just-dice limit. When I looked at just-dice a month ago the win limit was 265 per roll. It changes always. More importantly I used very simple numbers to make a point, there are too many variables at play to keep updating those numbers.
I am not going to refrain from posting because suckers can't comprehend things. You would need 400BTC in the silly example I gave, to win 1 satoshi at a time. If some poor guy has that then he should be smart enough not to gamble on what he doesn't understand. I used that example simply to show that there are a lot of variables that influence what most think they understand about gambling.

Don't get me wrong, I agree that it could do anything at this point your your arbitrary pinning of $1 per millibit makes zero sense. Neither does your comment about $10,000 on pure speculation. Let me rephrase, those comments make no sense unless you think bitcoin is a fad and will fail.

Right, but I mean a system where one company stores your bitcoins and only allows internal transfers. Keeping it internal they can keep the idiots happy by allowing transactions to be reversed and work their way into places like eBay where reversals are part of the entire business model. It's why eBay sucks but damn do the customers like it.
I fully expect someone to plant a Paypal on top of bitcoin in the near future, I'm actually surprised Paypal hasn't gotten a jump on it since they already have all of their legal stuff taken care of. It goes against the purpose of bitcoin in a sense but it would make it so much easier to  gain widespread adoption. Remember when Paypal paid you $10 for setting up an account and the merchant got $10 for referring someone that set up an account? I referred thousands of customers myself and Paypal grew exponentially virtually overnight.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:41:26
What I stated is quite clear, there was nothing in that pile of bullshit that suggested anything other than third parties not being allowed to conduct the transactions. They also can't be used in China to buy gold or silver.
Even this update doesn't say much of anything. Temorprarily suspended, continue to operate, find other ways for deposits, etc. 
Pardon me for wanting a healthy dose of facts to go along with the rampant speculation posted here. It would be much easier to decode if I spoke Chinese but I don't, and those that come here to translate give conflicting stories always. 
So since you can speak the language and tell what is going on, what payment options did they remove? Third party ones as expected? Other ones? Were there other ones even available? Someone said you can deposit after verifying ID, can you confirm or deny that?
I don't see the point of jumping to conclusions. In fact, the way you and others form opinions goes against how a critical thinking human works.

Haha, I wish I could have met someone at a coffee shop and deposited or withdrawn poker money so easily a few years ago. You are here doomsday preaching against something that could have saved poker had enough people known about it back then and you still don't see the big picture. 
Guess who would have never gotten in trouble for circumventing banking laws had they used direct bitcoin payments instead of credit card payments tagged as golf ball purchases.
Don't guess, Poker Stars and Full Tilt Poker. Full Tilt was a scam from the jump but Poker Stars would have never been in the hot water they were if they didn't have to deal with banks or credit cards at all. That is where the charges stemmed from. 
With the ease of creating new wallets, bouncing money in circles and allowing individuals to cash in and out the government would never have been able to track a single deposit or withdrawal to poker sites, confiscate millions of dollars in funds and shut down an entire industry.
**Black Friday would not have existed with Bitcoin as the chosen payment method.**

A single transaction moved 400,000 btc to a single address; this one:
I was going by that. Either way, this is pretty simple.
- Nobody with that many coins would be so stupid to dump them on an exchange and ruin their own net worth.
- Nobody with that many coins would trust an exchange with **all of them** at one time.
- Off book transfers don't really have a fundamental effect on Bitcoin. Sure you could say that a new owner might do something stupid but it's hard to imagine someone with that much money would sabotage their own holdings.
- For someone to suddenly move 2 year old coins and in that volume I would agree with you that something is probably going on. That something is far more likely to be starting a trust, starting a Bitcoin related company, securing them better or a number of other things that don't involve "lol I have a lot of money so I think I'll make it worth less!"

I just replied to the parent but I'll tell you the same. No, they were not idiots. The adoption rate and other good news for bitcoin is why the price got so high. It did not drop simply because it was that high, it dropped because of **new** circumstances in China. You did not predict that happening in the immediate future so you were basing your assessments on a gut feeling that "this is too good to be true" which is a ridiculous thing to do. Without the recent China happenings there was nothing stopping bitcoin from continuing to rise given adoption rates and other positives.

The system could be fixed, they just aren't going to fix it.
That said, how much we produce now doesn't matter. If all currency deflates over time you need less and less of it to buy the same amount of stuff. If this is true enough people **will** wait to spend their money that it has a noticeable effect. If nobody is buying anything we produce less, which requires less workers. After the explosion anyone with debt would owe more and more in value while earning less in value or none at all. 
It's not like that is going to happen anytime soon, and it's not like problems can't be worked out but this is stuff that will not happen in your lifetime. I was just pointing out that if everyone got paid in BTC right now, and it kept going up in value, almost everyone would suffer for it.

I'm not sure about anything out of China but what I am sure of is that every translated article and every interpreted article specifically says third party payment processors over and over again. The consensus is that those are what are banned which is nowhere near "the end of bitcoin in China!"
Given the fact that they only a few days ago said it's fine to treat bitcoin as a commodity I am going to go out on a limb and say that this interpretation is the correct one.

Do you know what a third party payment company is? Everyone is acting like it's the damn exchange when this sentence should let you know that is absolutely not true.


Third party payment companies are places like Alipay. You can still, unless I'm just nuts, deal directly with the exchange. This is an obvious solution to keeping up with who buys or cashes out of bitcoin.

So you think the entire bitcoin economy will cap out at $120 billion because that would put the coins around $10,000 each. I just can't grasp thinking it will get that far and stop since for it to get that far wider adoption will have taken place. 
Again, this thing could fall to zero very quickly but I think the trip from $120 billion to $1.2 trillion will be more likely than this initial runup was.

So many other variables, so little time. Also, your post makes so little sense. You are back to this "in theory" stuff which doesn't exactly hold up when you push the odds of losing out of the realm of possibility. I have been far too busy to write up anything with differing variables, and I really suck at math, but you can push the odds of losing even further by adjusting some things.
Even counting cards you can be "expected to win" but thanks to variance and standard deviations it is less of a guarantee than what I posted above unless you are playing infinite hands. This is all in reality by the way, not when you run infinite simulations that you would never have time to play in real life.
For the record, I only play poker where I know the odds are far better than whatever card counting provides. I find it a much bigger challenge to maximize ROI with every play than to follow a card counters rule book and hope for the best. 
There's so much more involved, but I don't want to sit here doing this all day. Play with your 1% edge if it works for you.

There is zero reason the insurance company would have to store BTC.
For starters, they could insure BTC for cash. Getting back the amount of money you had exactly when the "bank" folded is better than getting sweet fuck all.
More importantly, of course the insurance fee would rise based on how much BTC was valued at. If you set insurance at one satoshi per BTC (just an example) and BTC doubles then the insurance fee "doubles" as well once that is converted to fiat. The insurance companies would be fine and could figure out how to insure BTC for a fact.
Even if you demanded bitcoins back 1 for 1 they could arrange that if they really wanted to. It might require them to buy BTC over a period of months as to not send the market to the sky but there is no way they couldn't figure out how to manage that with their risk assessment that they do **as their whole business model**.
Your statement is the one that makes no sense. Unless somehow every Bitcoin was taken out of circulation they could always replace them, even at a bigger loss. You do realize that an insurance claim of this magnitude is always a loss anyhow right?
I mean if I were going to do it I'd insure it with straight USD or acquire BTC after an issue arose. Meanwhile, I would keep EVERY insurance payment in BTC and grow the reserves naturally that way which would reduce risk over time, slowly but surely. They might even be able to (gasp) lower the insurance fees as reserves got larger.

In Ripple IOU's have no set time limit on payback. You can't even sue if someone scams you because there are no terms.
In Ripple IOU's for BTC or something else are considered as good as real BTC. If a scammer is trusted for 1000 BTC those IOU's can be traded at face value.
In Ripple one person or company you "trust" can connect you with many other people that can cash out your actual balances on other exchanges thanks to how the system works.
In Ripple, there can be more IOU's for BTC than there are BTC in existence.
In Ripple, things suck. I have no further comments.

We are jumping the gun a bit. 
Right now bitcoin holders want somewhere to spend their coins.
Bitcoin is supposed to act as as a currency.
Bitcoin is volatile.
The fact  that millions of consumers might one day use bitcoin is an end game. Amazon taking payments now would not help people that want to spend dollars, only those that want to spend BTC either because they have it already or to support the whole experiment. If the experiment works out and millions hold bitcoin they would probably offer lower prices or other incentives since it saves Amazon money. 
The purposes of holding bitcoin today is not to shop on Amazon.

They can insure it for whatever the fuck they want. How fast it increases is irrelevant, they can handle it and nothing says you have to get back the exact to the penny replacement. They might decide to insure all BTC for exact value at time of crash, that is up to them and would be disclosed up front.
And every account would be insured individually up to a certain amount, you know, like it's done with the FDIC now.

@_date: 2013-12-17 14:04:32
You do realize they do more than take stuff and convert it to their currency right? Also, it's the same kind of difficult (and expensive) for them to do similar right now. They have to use third parties with high fees  and that's **if** they can get a Paypal account to take payments. I've helped them get cash in their currency many times and it is a process. With bitcoin they can sell services in 2 minutes and worry about converting it later, and they will figure it out. They also buy other services like hosting which they can do directly online without issue via bitcoin.
I don't know why so many here miss the big picture but I'll be damn surprised if this **doesn't** take off in India.

I do. On paper, any betting system loses always. On just-dice using the current max win you can use the Martingale on 35 consecutive bets. As long as you win by the 35th bet you are an overall winner (for a very tiny amount).
If you set the odds to 50/50 on the site your odds of not winning a single roll out of 35 is around 1 in 34 **billion**. 
Now since you are going to lose on average 1 out of 34 billion times **all** of your bankroll the system is a POS on paper. In reality, you will probably not live long enough to bet 35 billion times.
Again, there are a lot of variables that aren't taken into consideration when one says "it doesn't work!", this is just the simplest one to explain. The above example is exactly why casinos have minimum and maximum bets within a certain range. The fact that just-dice lets you adjust every aspect of the bet to exact decimals makes it even easier to exploit if you stick to a strategy with zero emotion involved. 
So I guess I should ask you, do you math? ;)

A restaurant is way different but we only take cash in our local business and we've maybe lost 2 sales in the last 5 years from it. We did keep a few potential scammers away by not accepting checks though. 
We did take credit cards at first but they lie about the fees. If it were only the per swipe and percentage advertised it would be fine but we sometimes paid more to the intermediary bank than we processed in a month due to all of the surcharges and bullshit.
If you have a debit card it will work at an atm. The end.

You are doing the normal reddit shit and talking out of your ass because you've read something somewhere. We have processed credit cards online going back to 1999 and took credit cards in our retail store in 2008 and 2009. I am fully aware of the ins and outs of how they work, advertised rates and everything else that goes with it. I have processed both standard and high risk transactions, I am familiar.
I know of two customers that did not come back over credit cards, since 2008. We do sell something that can't easily be sold online and we sell all we ever get so no, we aren't missing any customers. 
The advertised rates mean fuck all when you get down to it. Even when we took credit cards we offered a cash discount so we might process two transactions for $200 to $300 in a month. Fees = $120. Sure it was under 1% transaction fee and some pennies per swipe but they add all kinds of made up fees at their whim and automatically draft them from your account every month. We used two major banks for processing offline and both did the same thing even though the second was told the exact reason we were switching.
As far as chargebacks, I am well aware of the frequency and risks involved. This is especially true in high risk processing where a 1% maximum chargeback ratio is require to keep processing and that is on payments rife with fraud. 
I have paid ATM fees twice, both times after a customer bitched about the $2 it would cost them to go next door and use the ATM. 
I am denying access to whoever I want, the customer is not always right and our competitors do take credit cards which means I will gladly refer customers to them when the situation arises. I refer customers to competitors all the time whether they are complaining about the product, price or anything else. Again, we sell **everything** we ever offer for sale.
Anyhow, your entire misguided point it to show that people are losing money by dealing with bitcoin or not taking credit which is not only not the case for me but I wouldn't give a shit if it was.

2) Isn't it true that you can fund a bitcoin exchange directly through your bank?
3) Did you read something I haven't? You post as if there is 100% no chance that anyone can buy bitcoin in China through an exchange but
  a) They said the buy and sell of bitcoin was ok a few days ago.

Do you even comprehend that a Bitcoin ATM could be as simple as a fucking iPad at the local donut shop? In fact, it's pretty stupid to focus on machines that cost thousands of dollars when software can handle it on a touch screen many already have.
Someone will come along and let **anyone** with a business add a Bitcoin kiosk or even just offer the software to let them do it on their own for a commission. How many years will it take now? You have no idea so don't pretend you do.
Edit: The simple minded, tunnel vision that you suffer from is the same that most detractors are inflicted with. We are nearing 2014, I could start a local Bitcoin bank  that handles all of these services from home and it would take me about 3 minutes.

What I meant by that is that you can bet any amount  from 1 Satoshi up to whatever will pay the max payout at the time based on your chance to win and bet size. You can adjust the chance to win from .0001 all the way to 98.9999 and keep the house edge the same.
That allows for many more complex variations of the following.

Wrong on several levels.
If you are investing only to make money then what you say **might** be true. However, the same thing that can lose half it's value overnight can double overnight as well. You have no way to tell someone that they are stupid for taking that chance as you don't know their experience with such things, their percent of savings they are using or anything else important.
Moreover, there are other reasons for investing. I have invested in bitcoin to support this grand experiment with actual money. I am fully aware of the risks and rewards possible with this investment but money is not the primary motivator. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:10:50
I'm not going to respond to absurd straw men arguments. FinCEN is about regulating businesses that **could** be used for money laundering.

They allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin at will, this makes them a Money Transmitter service whether they like it or not. Registering with the federal government (just to be nice according to them) while ignoring all of the state laws is a recipe for disaster. 
BitPay on the other hand will only allow you to fund your wallet to handle refunds, requests documentation for anyone selling more than token amounts of merchandise per day and puts a disclaimer up that the service is not to be used for anything resembling money laundering. While there is some chance they are still afoul of a few state laws their good faith efforts to remain a third party processor and not fall under MSB status is probably enough to save them any real harm.
Edit: I use Coinbase and understand the risks I am taking by doing so.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:35:58
It's inconsequential to those holding BTC for long term gain. I guess it's a positive for those playing the market. You are correct that this is bad for consumers but it should level out if adoption continues to increase but it could take years to do so. 
Right now most just want to see BTC grow and someone like Amazon accepting it would be a miracle, and very good news.

I could be really dumb but I don't think the hedge funds are going to be buying and selling bitcoin on the open market. From my limited reading they seem to be set on holding large amounts of BTC and letting people invest fiat into it. 
So please explain how and why a hedge fund is going to manipulate the market. Just guessing but if they bundle up 50k bitcoins and let people invest in that I doubt very seriously they are allowed to liquidate any of those to play the market. Again, I could be wrong but they seem to be marketed as securities and wouldn't be very secure if they didn't exist.

If you read my comment history here you will find my thoughts on bitcoin laid bare. I am not an early adopter, I am not someone that guarantees it will go "to the moon" and I am not a fool. What I am is someone that sees you making ridiculous arguments instead of focusing on any that actually have merit in some way.
For the record, I like everything about bitcoin and will support it whether it succeeds, paves the way for something similar but different, or falls off the face of the earth completely. I have worked online long enough to know that **just** the micro-transaction part of the system is enough to possibly make it soar. I have been around long enough to know that **just** the decentralized aspect is enough for it to have a great chance at thriving. I have been involved long enough to know that **just** the ease of access and anonymity and several other things make it a viable option for millions of people around the world. 
Not only that, the momentum has already started. And while I shrugged off psychic hotlines, laughed at MLM schemes, warned people of the housing bubble popping years before it did, predicted Obama winning the  election before he announced and knew the Saints would win the Super Bowl that glorious year I am not against bitcoin just because it seems "weird". There is a perfect storm of stuff going on and while it may die it may also continue to gain traction and grow. 
I personally don't care if the price goes up, down or sideways. I want it to survive so that if I decide to open an online business in 2 years I can grab a wallet and process anywhere from 10 cents to 10 million dollars in a matter of seconds. That is something that was completely impossible prior to bitcoin and that alone is enough to make me a believer in the technology.

I'm just guessing at the purchases but those look like the fees on either $100 prepaid cards or Green Dot Moneypack cards. The cashier could have been in on it but it's not guaranteed. Sometimes they are just too stupid to figure out how to do multiple in a single transaction. Also, the thief probably didn't know the balance so used multiples of $100 to make sure they could clean it out.

Kind of like how they sold their services using all kinds of off the wall third party companies that held their money, made withdrawal extremely difficult and charged ridiculous fees way back many years ago? 
No shit they need it, that is why they will figure out how to get it out. You know, like finding someone to trade bitcoin for something they can use. Only now instead of having to waste weeks setting up to take payments via some POS service they can start taking bitcoin and earn while they are going through that process or trade those coins for a western union transfer.
I have actually been involved in that kind of business, and I've worked with people from India both buying and selling. I know enough about it to comment that bitcoin will be a blessing for them.

I'm mostly referring to the last exchange but cyber squatting your name on a forum is a non issue. You go to the forum, explain, prove who you are and they will usually help you out. If not a court order takes care of it. 
Having a multi message discussion with a psycho person while assuming the identity of all of the people they think you are is not "normal". Going to such lengths to have that discussion makes it even worse. If not deleting the best case scenario for that would have been to send the last message as a response to the first one received.

You are the one confused. I made a statement that the example given was not nearly as much "bad luck" as the one being complained about. You keep explaining things to me that everyone knows. I play poker, I am familiar with odds and how they work. The people above you were commenting on the odds of not winning 10 tries in a row which is way less likely to happen than getting sucked out on at the river. The worst beat you can ever take in poker has a 1 in 50 chance of happening. The odds you DON'T win one coin flip out of 10 = 1 in 1024. The statement was idiotic.

No more with you, this is fucking retarded. How many people make deposits would have nothing to do with what you paid. And again, if those payments were BTC it would be a set fraction regardless of the value of BTC. Insurance is a last resort to help people out if shit goes bad, you keep speaking as if the business folding is inevitable which is fucking ludicrous. 
In fact, you are bitching, complaining  and shit disturbing about someone insuring BTC in any way, it's all or nothing with you. Fact is, if they gave everyone a penny back per BTC should they go under it would be more than anyone else offers making your entire argument fucking stupid.

Oddly enough, a lot of the things that will make bitcoin more easily adopted are the same things the early adopters rail against. Sure it will always be decentralized but all kinds of limits and regulations will be on those that take steps to make this process easy. Each will have their own limits and rules while in turn being limited in what they can do legally.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:46:52
Yes but if you are going to spend it $10 is $10 regardless of how many decimals are used. Prices in bitcoin aren't fixed for the most part, they float with fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:50:15
But it is to be expected when something new and exciting starts making people money. It reminds me of the early days of the Internet when new industries came around and made tons of money. A lot of scammers showed up, a lot of do nothings expected to get rich just for existing in that ecosystem and people were encouraged to throw thousands at web development to make all of this awesome money. Know what though? Some of those industries went on to generate billions of dollars per year and yes, some of the idiots got rich in the process. It's pretty irrelevant in the big scheme of things.
As soon as the US government cracks down on illegal companies it will shake things up quite a bit. I'm hoping that by that point a company with some foresight has picked up bitcoin services legally or that it gets too big for the train to be stopped either way.
It's not a sure thing but even if bitcoin services were blacklisted in the USA the internet will find a way and I don't see it putting an end to things. Time will tell.

I've read the statute, I've read the guidance on virtual currency, I've read the exceptions and I've read that they consider all "facts and circumstances" of the overall business. That last one is a pretty clear cut way to say "we can adjust as needed if something we didn't pre-consider comes up".
This isn't even anything new. These discussions have been going on for as long as I've been online. This law is why you couldn't trade Paypal for e-gold a decade ago. This law is why you can't legally exchange Paypal with Payoneer with Paxum with ePassPorte (before they stole everyone's money). This guidance has only been added to say "also, virtual currencies are included".
You are fighting a decades old battle and you won't win. Ironically, if he took Paypal payments he probably would have been fine. Why? Because he can make them include a Paypal verified address and know that the coins went back to the person that bought them. Since Paypal is registered and keeps records as required that would suffice to show that he wouldn't inadvertently take your money and send it to some drug dealer in Mexico as part of a laundering operation.
It's not accusing him of being a money launderer, it's telling him that to run his service in a way that money launderers can abuse it **he has to comply with FinCEN regulations** that are simply to collect information on certain transactions.

Go add someone to your trust network and be sure you trust them or you could lose everything. But be sure to get a deposit to activate your account first. Send IOU's. Etc.

Bitcoin is tiny, this kind of market manipulation works in markets much larger than bitcoin. Everything is amplified here, if you submit a "confirmed translation" of Chinese news to every bitcoin forum you can find it can impact the price. It only takes a small market with lots of speculators a little bit of panic to set off a chain reaction.

A 12 billion market cap on a currency that co-exists with dollars that are spent as per usual does not allow for any conclusions to be drawn based on the data provided or available. I'm sorry, it just doesn't. 7,000 orders is a fraction of nothing. There are so many factors at play right now, we are all going to have to just wait and see.

I burned myself in Forex for awhile before I stopped worrying about day to day prices and focused on month to month prices. The fact that you burned yourself in stocks has no bearing on whether or not bitcoin was going to continue going up.

You seriously aren't understanding what he says. If I send a note to you and call you Satoshi will you make a post on here questioning whether the coins in that wallet belong to him? No, anyone can send dust to any wallet and ask if it's Satoshi. There could be a buyer and a seller, there could be one person that owns both wallets, there could be a a million things. The person asking if coins are for sale mentioning a name does nothing to prove that the address belonged  to anyone mentioned.

But when you decide "it's here to stay" is irrelevant to the price of the coin. You are trying to justify why they won't reach $100,000 per coin by telling me you won't accept it as currency until it takes over the dollar. If bitcoin captured 100% of the US economy each coin would be worth over $700,000 and that's not taking into account the millions that are not in circulation. Now consider that it is used worldwide and you'll see why it's irrelevant what percent of businesses in the USA accept it.

Edit: And to answer your one misguided point the antitrust would be in regards to companies that choose to work with bitcoin. Banks cannot shut down accounts of anyone dealing with something simply because they don't like it if it makes it impossible for a similar business to operate. BitPay, CoinBase and others will have something to say about this in the near future. In fact, with all that VC money coming in CoinBase might file their own lawsuits soon.

This is one of those things where if you are wrong you are going to be kicking yourself for being so stupid. You compared this to penny stocks, really?

Serious question, what did you think was going to happen? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:00:24
And you don't understand. It does not matter what mixing services do. When you send digital currency to someone and they transfer that to another "wallet" then **mail** those coins to someone it is impossible to say that the person receiving the coins is the one that purchased them. Since the incoming payment is anonymous no information has been collected (which is why it runs afoul of FinCEN) except that of the recipient who could be anyone. How efficient or inefficient it is and what other businesses are out there does nothing does not make it less illegal or against their rules.
Go ahead and find an originating wallet and the destination coin. Don't worry, I'll wait. Or did you not realize that he sends out coins of exact denominations? It's not like you can send him 7203.02 bitcoins and get that exact amount loaded. All anyone can see, regardless of what wallet is used, is that x thousand 1 BTC coins were shipped to various someones that may or may not have sent him money. 
And are you new to the US government? You cannot do business in the United States **at all** if you don't follow the regulations. That is why they have already confiscated coins from MtGox and will continue doing that kind of stuff until they either comply or shut out US citizens. If it comes down to it don't be surprised if they seize the domain. See Full Tilt Poker and MegaVideo.com. 
You can have whatever opinion you want on this matter, most think it's a complete shit way to handle regulations, but it is the truth. I did not say it's awesome and wonderful, I explained why he falls under FinCEN regulations which is pretty obvious since they told him as much.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:02:28
You compared the size of the total potential market in India to the total market in the USA. You did not take into account that only a tiny fraction of people in the USA participate in bitcoin. India could surpass the USA in terms of market share with nowhere near a 100% adoption rate of the segment of the market you described above. 
In short, how many people have a certain amount of money is not relevant in any way since only a fraction of them = more market share than is made up by all USA participants right now. Maybe bitcoin is more useful in India. Maybe bitcoin is less regulated in India. Maybe India is the only country to see widespread adoption. All kinds of scenarios could play out and the data you provided does nothing to argue for or against any of them happening.

I assumed you meant the overall price. The price on the street is affected by the price on the exchanges. That isn't so direct the other way around.

I'm done with this conversation after this but a few things.
1) I only posted that example because it was the easiest  for others to understand. All I did was prove that you can make the odds of losing your money astronomical. You can change your risk of ruin, odds of losing, expected return/loss a near infinite number of ways because of how the site works.
2) I could have a bot coded to employ this strategy, with varying degrees of risk, over thousands of accounts at a time. I could have them press up when certain profits are realized and whatever else I wanted. 
3) You don't double on wins so it would take an epic shit ton of wins to make 1BTC. Not calculating a dollar but it would be a lot. Again, this was an off the cuff example only to show that you can push the odds of losing into insane territory if you want.
4) Yes, bet big and ruin goes up. You can toy with the odds and payouts in some neat ways though.
In the long run could show expected results only after a million years. At some point you have to accept that if your negative expectation is not expected to hit in any reasonable amount of time that it's not a good indicator at all.

Gold has value because it can be used for actual things. If you bought up all of the gold supply right now those industries that need it would be willing to buy it from you, immediately. The USD is backed by the promises of the US government. Whether or not you believe those promises you can guarantee that a lot more believe them than have faith in BTC. 
My point was, wouldn't BTC be even more trusted if something of actual value was stored. Currently it's hopes and dreams supporting the price, but that might not always be enough.

You have proven yourself an idiot with the first paragraph. 
Especially this part.


If you were an actual "professional gambler" you would know that even the casinos employ the exact same strategy. You should damn sure know as a blackjack player with a much more limited bankroll.
You never have an exactly 0% RISK OF RUIN no matter what the odds are. By card counting you are employing this exact strategy because you are putting the odds in your favor but still betting on the very unlikely event of a string of very bad luck eating your entire bankroll. 
Your entire argument is now hilariously pathetic. If you were an actual professional gambler this is something you would understand inherently. You are either a liar, or a hobbyist counter and either way your entire thought process is severely flawed.

I am talking about how dense you are. You have a hang up with the fact that I explained quite clearly how you can push your odds of losing to 1 in 34 billion. What you don't seem to grasp is that **your** odds of losing if counting cards perfectly is much higher than that. Standard deviation and risk of ruin are not your friends.
And yes, the fucking casinos employ that same strategy because over infinity even their house edge can cause them to go bankrupt. They have a risk of ruin that is more than 0, they are simply betting that the astronomical odds of that happening won't happen. You are doing it with a much higher risk of ruin because it is on a much smaller scale (your bankroll). The odds of **you** going broke are far greater than 1 in 34 billion making your method more of a gamble. If you were telling the truth of course.
These reasons are why casinos have a set betting spread and do not allow unlimited size bets at all. If Europe bet 1 trillion on black the casino would have a 3.xx% house edge but a risk of ruin of around 47%.

The problem is that Amazon is cheaper than wholesale so anyone offering that much stuff is shipping **from** Amazon. A small service fee would annoy you as well?

That doesn't even make sense. And if by gambling you mean "I bet I don't win the Powerball today" then sure, it's gambling. You call yourself a professional card counter, you should know full well that once you reach the realm of 1 in 34 billion that the definitions of "luck" and "gambling" change a little bit. Card counters rely on putting the odds in their favor in much smaller increments.

If the US bought huge amounts of bitcoins the price would go so astronomically high based on the gesture that everyone's collective heads would explode. If they'd pay their debt off in bitcoin it wouldn't even have to crash.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:32:38
Dude, being savvy does nothing to make you give a shit to hide worthless information. What bitcoin is worth today is not what it was worth back then. There was no reason at the time to thing bitcoin would ever get this big.

Complete and utter bullshit. Current tax laws cover Bitcoin right now. The only problem is reporting, which you are required to do with Bitcoin just like you were required to do with Paypal even though nobody did. It took them **forever** to get Paypal straightened out somewhat and like you said, that is a system based in USD and banks.

You are completely clueless and there is no excuse for that on the world wide web. A month ago just-dice held over $50,000,000 in investors money, you can go read the thread where investors discuss the site on the bitcointalk forums. The bets are real, all numbers and information are disclosed right up front and you are very simple minded if you just discount it because you don't like the design. Most bitcoin sites lack in the graphics department, I guess the analytical types that early adopted bitcoin don't give a shit about such things.
tl;dr: You posted a ridiculous statement that can be easily disproved by searching google for 10 seconds. It should be embarrassing.

There is no way employers are going to start paying in Bitcoin anytime close to soon. You would be inviting regulatory oversight that they could actually, you know, oversee.

Save for some major catastrophe I'd say it easily gets over 10k as well. At that point 40k isn't much of a leap. When I say that I mean in ++ years, not tomorrow. There is no reason for bitcoin to be stable in the immediate future, none. It will be extremely volatile until adoption increases quite a bit more. It is on pace, but not the same pace that btc increased in value.
That Winkle dude has millions invested in BTC. He did put his money where his mouth is and I guarantee you he isn't panicked right now. You are taking financial advice from 18 to 20 year olds that backed into  "free money" and have zero experience in how any of this works.

Spending goes up because people that started with pennies can suddenly buy Lamborghini's and they'd rather cash out than risk leaving with nothing. I wouldn't use that as evidence that this will always be the case.

The apathy and nitpicking on display here is surprising given the general attitude of the community. You are right, the general purpose of your comments are clear, how we get from point a to point b is not really relevant. Something should be done about this, if there is any way at all to do it.

Are you sure about that? Have you seen the forums lately? The casinos? The drugs? lol

You could be absolutely correct but I what I've read on these funds didn't seem to indicate any of that would be happening. Do you think Wall Street investors are going to trust their money to MtGox or similar when all of the exchanges are operating illegally here?

The haters man. There is no reason you can't pay taxes or the maintenance costs in bitcoin. Also, this is an easy way to make a $200,000 withdrawal all at once. He could let the car sit and sell it in 10 years. Can you do the same with BTC for absolute sure?
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:57:09
Serious question, wouldn't the technology be supported by the "coins" being backed by something with actual value at all times. I don't know, maybe the souls of virgins or something.

Dude, come the fuck on. The difficulty adjusts automatically to account for how much power is being diverted to the network. It is a self correcting "problem" by default.

At least use troll arguments that make sense. Of course businesses convert bitcoin to fiat, there is no other choice right now because bitcoin does not cover their wholesale / payroll / tax costs without being converted.
I know you are just shit disturbing, but you are doing a horrible job at it.

A user here reported having bitcoin stolen and this account was linked as the recipient.
Does anyone know how they were tagged as BTCthief with a link to the url? The person that first posted this has stated that she isn't the one that tagged it.
I find it odd that someone can tag an address like this where seemingly all mentions of their wallet show this tag.

It's so weird to post a coindesk article when this was also on coindesk.
Which seems to be much more in line with what even the new articles say. No third party payment systems. That would be the in between funding places like Alipay.

If they are worried about the ATM fee I'll give them $4 off. I'm not losing $10+ on a sale so someone can save $4 or a trip to their bank then paying hundreds per month for the privilege. Customers do all they can to fuck over businesses (in general), and while I will go out of my way for the ones that shop with me I do not feel bad about only accepting cash.

And the idiots don't seem to understand that this shit is brand new, companies are making it more idiot friendly every day and the end result won't be your grandparents having to know anything about how Bitcoin works, just that it does. Don't worry, one day even you will be able to send BTC to someone without having the slightest idea why it's even worth something.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:28:31
Oh man, good luck.
It's not that the concept is difficult, it's a pretty basic premise, but the price quoted on elance is extremely low for something so important. There is no way security will be up to par for that price no matter what third world coder does the work. I would also worry about scalability as building a working model is a lot less complicated than building a working model that can scale quickly and painlessly. 
The licenses are probably exactly the same regardless of whether or not fiat is used. They are for sure the same in the USA, I'm sure some countries don't regulate it at all yet but do your own research there.
No clue on the server but servers and bandwidth are cheap these days. 
And security again. You are wanting to deal with peoples money and that is a huge thing. It's nearly impossible to get a script for any amount of money that is 100% secure, new vulnerabilities are found all the time and ongoing server management could be really expensive. Then you have to be concerned with the person that does the work coming back to clean everyone out once it's popular or even someone doing minor tweaks a year down the road. You lose $50,000 for someone you don't get to point fingers at the programmer and shrug. 
Again, good luck if you move forward.

Does the IRS take euros? I would say you can pay the IRS in euros as well, having a middle man involved does not change that.
