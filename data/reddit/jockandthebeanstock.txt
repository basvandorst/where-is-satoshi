And the best time to sell is also yesterday.

My parents would lecture the hell out of me if they knew I owned bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:16:55
I’m in

I’d say, if it’s money you don’t need, then go for it. If you will need it, then add it to or open an investment account. Bitcoin is high risk/reward. So you could lose a lot or gain a lot. But because you can lose, it’s best to only buy what you can afford to lose and be excited for to gain. That’s my 0.000002 BTC on the subject.

I wasn’t going to sell off everything right away. My account is still open too. There’s just no money in it. I’m keeping it just in case I want to use it again. But as of now, I no longer use it.

I was one of them. Password changed already.

No movement, hodl. Small increase/decrease, hodl. Big drop, buy. Big increase, sell. As long as Bitcoin doesn’t die, you won’t lose. You just might have to hodl for a few years.

Why can’t they make it $10? I would love that chance again.

I can’t wait for Marge trend.
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:25:50
Thanks. Don’t need to worry about that though. I used a 32 randomly generated string of accepted characters any time I made a password on Robinhood.

You can deposit them with a phone app. Never had and issue with it. Plus, you still have the check if there was an issue.

I have others. I’m just saying this one will be a no.

No Hodler
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:35:04
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. I use it as an investment tool. With Cashapp, you can transfer it out of the app and into your own wallet. It’s not a security so crypto is not protected or Robinhood. So if something happens to it, it’s gone and you are not insured for the amount lost.

No other financial institution app I have or used cares, meaning no jailbreak detection. It’s not risk management, it’s control.

If you prefer stock iOS, more power to you. I didn’t lose and functionality.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:13:18
Not the card. The device. Jailbreaking it.

I’ll stop if and when I get 21 million BTC
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:15:19
I’m glad it’s going down. I’m going to buy more. I’m hodling for a few years at least.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:51:03
Yep. Glad you agree.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:49:11
Didn’t know about it. But I now made a post. Maybe someone will have the compassion to pay for my dream car.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:51:57
I’m buying bitcoin fat 10x market value. Just send it to my wallet and in 3-5 business months, you will have the money.

I’m the first trillionair thanks to bitcoin.

Me too. I’m excited it’s crashing again. But the dips.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:26:21
I didn’t. I bought. I happy.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:23:59
I like Cashapp. I like that they provide you with the proper tax documents for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:22:10
Yes. But it’s legal and you can still use the device and all its functions. But denying you the ability to functionality use a credit card because you modified a device you own, a computer, is the issue.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:02:41
If I’m not allowed to use a device I own how I want to use it by jailbreaking it, then that card is a huge no from me.

This is more brutal then the pain olympics.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:03:12
I’m ok with this
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:02:01
I use Cash App. They provide the problem tax forms too and that is important for me.
