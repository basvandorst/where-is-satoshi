Lol, you don't know how credit cards make money?  They charge a 0.5% to 5% fee on all transactions.  The fee is generally paid by the merchant.  
And no, you only pay sales tax if the merchant collects it, and most merchants accepting bitcoin don't currently collect sales tax on those transactions.

You're very confused.  Miners stopped supporting XT because they started facing spam attacks and top developers stopped voicing support after they were kicked off the dev mailing list and censored everywhere by the blockstream mafia.

You're factually incorrect.  The last halving was on November 28th, 2012.  The price was $12.  3 months later (February 28th, 2013), the price was $32.44.  That's a fine increase of 170%, except that an increase of 170% over 3 months happened several times before, and several times after that period.  In other words, increases of 170% over 3 months have been fairly common in bitcoin's history.  The fact that one such rally happened after a halving was largely coincidental.

It doesn't pretend anything.  It recognizes that bitcoin currently has a problem.  Blocks are filling up.  I personally had a transaction sit for 24 hours with zero confirmations during the dust attack a few months ago.  
So either we can stick our head in the sand and watch bitcoin die as a stagnant technology, or we can continue to innovate.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:30:58
You keep using the word "valid."  How are you defining it?  In any scenario in which a supermajority of miners are mining a chain, at least *some* users would view it as the valid one.  
But more practically speaking - the vast majority of bitcoin users are incapable of and uninterested in distinguishing between competing blockchains.  The most likely scenario of two competing chains imo is that one gets attacked by the dominant hashing powers and is rendered dangerous/useless, so users stick with the one that most miners favor.
To me, the blockchain that actually servers to predictably confirm transactions is the valid one.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:00:25
And no, miners can't.  Because miners compete with one another.  
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:20:51
Yea, facts are inconvenient.  Let's just ignore the recent periods where we had to wait 24+ hours for a single confirmation because of spam attacks.  Clearly bitcoin is way better than credit cards.

Coinbase is great.  It takes a few days to connect your bank account the first time (to facilitate ACH transfers).  If you deposit cash, you can then bid on coinbase exchange and get your BTC totally for free, no fees (as long as you're acting as a market maker.)  If you lift the offer, it's a very small fee.

What is Coinbase centralizing exactly?  Bitcoin is controlled by the miners.  How much hashing power does coinbase control?
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:32:15
Incorrect.  If other miners mine on top of that first miner's block, then the blockchain continues to grow and it will forever include that "contentious" mined block.  If some users want to use an entirely separate blockchain, they're free to create an altcoin.  
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:57:44
Nope.  We're at just under full blocks **now**.    Delaying innovation 6+ months to get "consensus" (i.e. a solution the blockstream mafia support) sends a powerful signal that bitcoin is incredibly slow to make necessary changes.
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:49:54
Except they can't.  Since users aren't miners, and only miners can mine blocks and confirm transactions.  Users can't use an alternative chain, since "using" a chain requires publishing transactions to it, and confirming transactions requires miners.
I get your point, but the key is that the consensus *must* include a large number of miners, but only needs to include an arbitrarily small number of users.  Let's say 99% of miners and 1% of users want chain A.  The 99% of miners could hijack chain B by simply mining on top of it and double spending or doing whatever they want to it.

Similar to buying bitcoin on a market, liquidity is extremely high if you have a broad enough price range.  Bitpay (and coinbase and bitfiniex and whomever) run out of coins quickly at a particular price, but have access to many more $5 and $20 higher.
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:25:22
Are you confusing bitcoinxt and blockstream?  It's blockstream that's trying to stagnate bitcoin tech and keep blocks small so that users have to send transactions through a single monopoly (blockstream) that will get to collect fees.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:26:47
In your example, entities controlling 51% of the hash power use that power to stop/reverse transactions in larger blocks to accumulate more fees for themselves at the expense of the network.  And they do so in such a way that deliberately creates orphan blocks (i.e. without sufficient warning to other miners).  Very black and white 51% attack.
No, most soft forks are not attacks.  There's definitely a bit of gray area, but in your example, the miners were specifically trying to screw other miners by surprise.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:09:37
Single best way to undermine bitcoin imo, is to force the technology to stagnate.  Always promise that major technological changes are over the horizon but can't be released without more consensus, more polishing etc.  In the mean time, the technology becomes obsolete and dies.
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:30:42
How on earth do you think coinbase centralizing anything?  They're one competing company.  No one has to use them for anything.

  The first asset the new crypto trades against is completely irrelevant.  I could always convert USD to BTC a few hours before I'm planning on converting the BTC to the new digital currency.  Doing it that way mostly eliminates my exposure to BTC price changes.  There's no reason to sit on BTC for a year for the purpose of later converting it to something else.  
  As for the question of why sell out now - in any market, there is "fast money" and "slow money."  The "fast money" are the corporate insiders and professional traders (real professionals at hedge funds with 8 and 9 figure trading books, not these whale club kids) who get information before everyone else.  I used to be a professional commodity trader at a hedge fund.  I would never try to time the commodity market now that I'm no longer at a hedge fund.  Competing against professionals in their arena is stupid.  Similarly, I'm "slow money" in digital currencies.  By the time I have a level of confidence that a successor to bitcoin has arrived, the bitcoin price will probably have already fallen 75%+, because the "smart money" will have moved already.  
  I like the article you linked to and agree with it in general.  The critical point though is that nothing in there requires bitcoin to be the eventual winner.  Bitcoin's current network size mean that an upstart currency can't just be a tiny bit better to compete against it - few people will abandon bitcoin for something a tiny bit better.  But if/when someone has a major technological innovation, bitcoin will either adopt the change, or it will fail and the new upstart will win. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:04:15
I offered a paragraph of specific datapoints as evidence and logic that you cited above.  In basic statistics, the way you test for statistical significance is to compare an event to the null hypothesis i.e. that a move of that size happened by chance.

Ahahahahah You don't even realize how off the mark you are.  The whitepaper that launched the lightning network was titled, "“Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged **Sidechains**."

Lol, so you're changing the time frame from a few months to almost half a year?  It's pretty easy to construct any narrative you want if you can just arbitrarily create a timeframe to match your story.  Bitcoin is only 5 years old.  If you're gonna to grab a period that reflects 10% of its entire history, early in its growth period, the odds that you'd randomly see massive growth are quite high.  By that standard, 1500% isn't even all that high.  Bitcoin had bigger moves that happened faster at other times (i.e. $0.10 to $2.00) that had nothing to do with the halving.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:06:22

Differentiating between miners and mining pools is great in theory...unless you understand how they actually work.  The mining pool operator can have total control over the pool *until miners leave it* which takes time.  So the mining pool operator could easily, say, launch a double spend attack before the constituent miners in the pool even know what's going on.
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:17:04
Settlement in bitcoin takes 10 minutes when blocks aren't full.  There's nothing to prevent a spam attacker from filling up blocks with spam as has happened a few times now.
Your example of decentralization in action only seems to occur when one mining pool exceeds 35%+ of hashing power.  People complain about how US banks are "too big to fail" but they're nothing compared to the centralization in bitcoin mining.  I'll say it again.  Bitcoin is much more centralized than banking and much more brittle.

That's not a fault of the computer, it's just the reality of growth.  Bitcoin with 1 MB blockchains was awesome.  But as Satoshi noted in 2010, if bitcoin is widely adopted the 1 MB blocksize will become obsolete and bitcoin will have to adopt larger blocks.

You don't seem to understand what "alternative coin" means.  Satoshi created bitcoin with soft forks and hard forks in mind.  Bitcoin was created to be capable of continued technological evolution.

You seem to really misunderstand the monetary system.  Ideally, we'd have an entire self-contained bitcoin ecosystem that is perfectly decentralized and regulation-resistant.  But we'd still need a way to move money from that system to the traditional fiat system (like to pay taxes, or transfer inheritance or wages into bitcoin).  That's where coinbase comes in. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:32:38
The entire reason to keep the block size small is to facilitate centralization, just in a different way.  The idea is that if blocks are too small to hold all the transactions, then bitcoin users will be forced to use the sidechain.  Bitcoin core is placing Blockstream as the monopolistic controller of the bitcoin sidechain.  
Keep blocks small -&gt; create a blockstream monopoly at the heart of bitcoin.

Agreed.  The point is there's nothing we could do to stop this, because the CIA miners would not be distinguishable from other miners.  For all we know, the two biggest Chinese miners *are already* CIA controlled.   Or 21 Inc could be a CIA project.  Or the Core devs could be CIA controlled.

You're very confused.  At one point in 2014, 1 miner had more than 50% of the hashing power, and for most of 2013 and 2014, 2 miners had more than 50%.  We've already experienced peak bitcoin centralization.  Yes, a more decentralized system would be awesome.
You know what would also be awesome?  If we could continue posting transactions to the blockchain instead of having to pay a monopolistic intermediary like blockchain to do it since the blocks filled up.
You know that's the whole point of this forum right?  It's to force bitcoin to stagnate as a technology and be incapable of transmitting transactions, so that bitcoin users have to turn to the monopoly at the heart of new bitcoin core - blockstream.

Ah, then I agree it's not a 51% attack.  Why do you think miners don't do this?  I think because fees are currently a trivial portion of miner revenue.  The coin reward is *much* more important.  If miners reduce the value of the bitcoin network by making blocks smaller, they'd be hurting themselves by lowering the value of the payout and devaluing their existing hardware investment.

You really don't understand the concept of forks.  Bitcoin was invented to fork - Satoshi discussed it at length.  For a fork to actually happen, the majority of hashing power has to support it, which means there has to be a consensus.  Any hard fork that happens will be a consensus fork by definition, and it's extraordinarily unlikely that it will produce any losses.  99% of users won't even notice the change.

You're very confused.  The consensus among *users* is completely **meaningless**.  That's how Satoshi set it up.  Miners control the network for better or worse.

No.  If you look at exchange liquidity, you could easily get $1 million dollars worth over less than $20 of price slippage which is less than 5% of the current price of bitcoin.  You'd be getting 5% less of goods, equivalent to a standard city's sales tax, or a high credit card transaction fee.

The idea of a sidechain monopoly at the heart of bitcoin is literally being openly advised by the bitcoin core developers.  It's amazing that you think it's a "conspiracy" when it's actually the basic plan they're openly advocating.

@_date: 2015-12-24 18:37:02
Newcomers are irrelevant to this discussion, because they're not estimating a fair price having anything to do with the halving.  
A more accurate way of saying it is that most bitcoin buyers are including the limited supply of 21m coins in their evaluation of bitcoins' value.
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:25:19
First, the "lack of trust" idea with bitcoin is just wrong.  For large parts of 2014, the majority of hashing power was controlled by just 2 pools.  Even today, the majority of hashing power was able to sit on a single panel at the recent scaling conference.  We are all trusting 3-4 miners with the entire bitcoin network.  And currently, they're all in China, not even subject to US court systems.  These miners could decide to do whatever they want, and it would even be legal.
Call me crazy, but I trust a consortium of banks subject to laws far more than I trust a group of 3 or 4 privately held Chinese banks that can screw us over without even breaking any laws.  Bitcoin requires infinitely more trust than US banking.  If Citibank screws me, I at least have a legal system to turn to.
As for what bitcoin was designed to address - it's a long list of stuff.  Some of that stuff bitcoin does well (like being disinflationary).  Other things it does poorly: like being used for cheap and quick transactions.  During the spam attack a few months ago I had transactions that sat at zero confirmations for 24+ hours.  Of course bitcoin *could* make changes to improve these issues, but bitcoin has so far failed to.  So now there's talk of using the lightning network to address this, and the lightning network will be controlled by a single privately held monopoly.  Again...I'd prefer a consortium of banks to a single company setting prices on transactions.  
The disinflationary nature of bitcoin (versus fiat) is indeed very attractive in concept.  But consider this: over a decade of moderate inflation, the US dollar might lose 50% of its purchasing power.  In contrast, we've seen bitcoin lose 70%+ of its purchasing power in a single year.  
You mention that a private ledger can be changed by privileged entities.  A private blockchain could be set up so that past entries can't be changed by anyone.  And future entries of bitcoin can also only be changed by privileged entities.  Again, only miners who successfully hash a block get the privilege of making an addition to the blockchain and today it's basically a dozen entities who ever have a shot of doing that.

It makes no sense to use that definition, or bitcoin today is itself an altcoin (relative to bitcoin in the past).

Not true.  Many miners also run full nodes.  Selling of the currency is entirely distinct and depends entirely on where/how fiat-holders who want to buy bitcoin want to transact.

I think it'd be disastrous, not because of small blocks, but because once people see that bitcoin as a technology has become so static, they'll move on to more interesting and dynamic projects.  Engineers will prefer to work on more innovative technologies (whether altcoins or some other form of fintech).  VCs will invest in something with a brighter future.

I'm still having trouble with your terminology.  If the end goal is for people to have the choice to run nodes, then you're saying it would be your definition of success if we had the exact same number of nodes running as today as a result of people simply choosing not to run nodes?  To be clear, if we made it *much* easier to run a full node, but fewer people still made the choice to run nodes, you're saying that we would still have achieved the "end goal", since you're defining the end goal as simply the choice?
  It's strange to me to prioritize this choice so highly.  All the various forms of decentralization that we're talking about are just means to ends.  What do we really want? Why do we really care about decentralization?  Satoshi suggested we want decentralization for a variety of reasons, including to make bitcoin censorship-resistant, robust, etc.  It's important to identify *why* we want decentralization, because it may lead us to accept different marginal costs.  There is a cost to maintaining 5,000 nodes, and a bigger cost to increasing to 30,000 nodes, etc.  Exactly what are we gaining from the increase in nodes?  How much additional censorship resistance?  How much DDOS protection?  How much are we reducing the risk of a 51% attack, etc.  These are all important questions so that we can weigh what we're willing to trade for these benefits.

"Store of value it has been amazing."  Lol, you must have skipped economics 101.  Bitcoin's realized volatility has been *much* higher than any of its competitors for store of value (sovereign debt, precious metals, developed world fiat currencies.)  
Bitcoin has certainly been a great speculative asset (assuming you bought at a good time), but that's not a use case, and it's a double edged sword.  There are people who bought bitcoin at $600 or $800 or $1000 a full 2 years ago and are still 50%+ underwater.  Good stores of value don't do that.  You might as well have picked a good penny biotech stock.

theymos disagrees.  He has argued extensively that moderation is powerful.
@_date: 2016-01-01 00:51:59
So much wrong in one paragraph.  Where to start?
First, no one says fees are too expensive now.  You're simply failing to understand the non-linear nature of blocksize.  If/when we get the mempool overloaded again, the entire fee market simply stops working.  This happened a few months ago during the "dust" attack.  I personally had a half dozen transactions sitting unconfirmed for 24+ hours.  I would have happily increased the fees to $0.10 or whatever, but that wasn't an option; the transactions were already sitting in limbo.  For a couple days, bitcoin simply ceased to function.  If that happens again, we'll likely see people start turning to alternatives for their cryptocurrency needs.
Second, there's no reason to prematurely abandon bitcoin for microtransactions.  Bitcoin is still in beta mode.  It's nascent.  It's wayyy too early to give up on this major value proposition.  "bitcoin is long past the day of being affordable to transact on the chain for these people."  This is so comically wrong it's funny.  Even at 1 MB blocks, most transactions are &lt;$0.01.  We could keep the average transaction cost at &lt;$0.01 for another 1-2 years easily, by just doubling the block size.  
Third, the whole "large blocksize reduces decentralization" is a joke of a red herring.  75% of bitcoin hash power is controlled by 6 dudes in China.  In 2014, a single pool controlled more than 50% of the hash power for a month.  Where are the Core Devs proposals to fix this?  
Fourth, you're getting the order backwards.  The first priority is for bitcoin to keep confirming transactions and to keep functioning.  Decentralization, optimized data structures etc, those are all important and good.  But none of it means anything if we get the mempool overloaded and we have confirmation chaos again.   
Fifth, the "resource demand of nodes" argument is nonsense.  We shouldn't be building bitcoin around the technological limitations of a handful of people that are effectively using AOL dial-up in 2016.  Strangling the entire bitcoin network because some people choose to operate behind the great firewall is moronic.

That scenario would be fairly innocuous.  The concern is that if 75% of hashing power vanishes, one big non-US chinese miner would probably control the network then.
But the more dangerous scenario is if the Chinese government (or an oligopoly syndicate of 3 big Chinese miners) was exerting influence more subtly.  Lots of directions that could take.  Main point is it's just not decentralized.

I'm sure you understand the basic economics that volatility is at best a zero sum game.  For every trader who makes money by successfully buying low and selling high, someone else lost money by buying high and selling low.  
In practice, volatility is far worse than that.  Specifically, it means that bitcoin is a poor "store of value" by the very economic definition of the term.   In case you skipped that chapter in your economics textbook, the lack of predictability makes it bad for things like fixed cost planning.  Let's say I need about $20k next year to send my child to college. Inflation in fiat is uncertain, so maybe I'll really need a little more or less, but that uncertainty is pretty small.  For 1 year, USD is a pretty good store of value.  In contrast, how many bitcoin do I need today to be sure I'll be able to afford the college bill next year?  We've seen bitcoin fall 70% in 1 year, so it's impossible to say.
And no, speculation is not a "use case."  It renders bitcoin nothing more than a token for gambling, easily replaceable with anything else that fluctuates wildly in value.  Bitcoin is no better as a speculative tool than litecoin, or biotech penny stocks, or a horse at the track.
The "use cases" we're looking for are things that fundamentally generate value for bitcoin.  What is bitcoin better at than any available alternative?  Currently the only answer is darknet purchases.  Eventually, it may become a legitimate store of value (as a speculative holder of bitcoins I certainly hope so.)  
Whether or not it will also develop for things like remittances, micropurchases, large cross-border financial transactions etc, remains to be seen.

**more than 90% of bitcoin investors and more than 90% of the investment in bitcoin has occurred in the last 2 years.**
You're confused about the concept of capital weighting.  Very often in investing, an asset will spend most of its time going up, but most people investing in it will lose money.  This is because an **overwhelmingly large percentage of actual money is in the asset in the top 25% of its price range.**  When bitcoin was at $1, there were less than 1/4 as many bitcoins in existence, and they were held by less than 1/1000th of the current # of bitcoin investors.  
You're also confused about the concept of a trend.  A trend can be falsified by a single data point.  For example, imagine if Amazon suddenly collapse down to $100 a share.  Even though Amazon had been trending up over 99.9% of the last decade, you could no longer say, "Amazon is in an upward trend."

My house example was stupid.  What I should have said is that bitcoin was born as a speculative asset.  It wasn't used as a currency in 2009, and even today I'd wager that it's rarely used as a currency.  The vast majority of transactions are tied to speculation on its price.  So a better comparison would be bitcoin to something like beanie babies or fine wine or maybe copper.  There's no perfect analogy. But currencies aren't a great comparison from an economic point of view.

The "easy" changes have been incredibly hard to make, because everyone is terrified of change without 100% consensus.  The mempool was overloaded 6 months ago and we had 24+ hour confirmation times and no changes were made to the code.  
Don't you think it's silly talk about how scary a decrease in node count is without having any idea of what the "right" or "minimum" amount of nodes is?  Node count fell by 40% and it didn't produce any problems.  Personally, I'd wager that delayed confirmations and an overloaded mempool will cause more harm than a drop from 5k to 4k nodes.

Doublespending on small purchases is simply a myth.  Many business owners have written about how they've had all sorts of payment policies that depend on customer honesty and they've had virtually zero scams.  Here's a simple example: most high end department stores allow customers to return used items even after great lengths of time.  Do they very rarely get scammed?  Sure.  But it's so rare that it's still a profitable and widely used business practice.

So what is the problem itself?  Are you saying that a higher "cost of being decentralized" is the actual problem, and lack of decentralization is just a symptom?  Why should we care at all about the "cost of decentralization" if it doesn't actually have any impact?  
I think you have it backward.  Cost of being decentralized is totally irrelevant unless it actually has an impact on the level of decentralization.  And there's obviously a ton of variables at play that makes those two not directly connected.  For example, the cost of handling 1 MB blocks is continuously falling as computer hardware improves and internet connection speeds improve.

The core purpose of nodes (propagating transactions) only requires about a dozen nodes spread throughout the country in total.  But such a system would be very fragile.  Governments could seize them or shut them down, or bad actors could DOS attack them easily.  Additionally, nodes determine the acceptance of blocks and thus play a major role in "voting" on bitcoin's evolution, and we don't want that power centralized in the hands of a small number of people.
So, we want lots of nodes, spread throughout lots of legal jurisdictions for purposes of robustness, and "democracy" aka decentralization in determining bitcoin forks.  I've never heard anyone make a compelling argument why it makes much of a difference if there's 5k vs 10k nodes, or 5% of users vs 10% of users running nodes.
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:40:53

You think all (or even the majority) of the 5000 people running full nodes are doing it for that reason?  You think the marginally higher costs of larger blocks change the calculus such that people who want to validate receiving payments no longer want to?

The focus on node resources is really strange imo.  Bitcoin is highly centralized today both in terms of hashrate (about 6 Chinese dues basically control the network) and in nodes (there are very few full nodes operating, and it has nothing to do with resources, it's because there's minimal incentive to run one.)
If we actually care about having more nodes, the answer is to provide a reward for running one.  Hamstringing bitcoin, reducing its value as a transaction network to prevent the node count by shrinking a bit further is insane.

Then the gold isn't the money, it's simply backing the money, a critical difference.  You can't pretend something is "portable" when you have to instead create a portable proxy to use it.  
A thousand years ago, gold was truly one of the most portable forms of money available.  It was certainly easier to transport a pound of gold then to transport a hundred bushels of wheat or a dozen oxen.  Today, gold (and certainly silver) are relatively un-portable.  
Then we can talk about stability.  Gold is relatively stable in supply, but silver isn't.  Lots of silver gets mined every year.  The two are very different in that regard.  Gold bugs tend to like the stable supply, although most economists will tell you that having a fixed supply form of money in a growing economy is disastrous, because it produces indefinite deflation which causes hoarding of money.

You're simply misusing basic vocabulary.  Trust me, I work in finance and have a degree in economics.  In finance and economics, we refer to "speculation" as a relatively short-term bet on the future value of an asset.  It's a bet that depends not on the intrinsic value of that asset, but on how others will value the asset in the future.  It is in contrast to "investing" which is a relatively longer term purchase of an asset that generates cash flows, on the basis of intrinsic value.  In this context, it's impossible to "invest" in gold, because gold produces no cash flows and is not a productive asset.  Similarly, shorting a stock is always speculation, because being short equity requires that other people eventually agree with your view on the equity for you to profit.  Any purchase of gold is speculation that future prices of gold will be higher.  It's literally a bet on what other speculators will do.  In contrast, if I buy equity or bonds of Microsoft, I can win without anyone else ever agreeing with my view.  Even if I never sell the equity or bonds, I will receive a stream of dividends or bond payments.  
"use case" in this context is an application of a technology or service that generates value for the user.  For example, the primary "use case" of a television remote is to change the channels of my television.  It's "use case" as a paperweight generates almost no value, because it has no advantage in that regard over a rock.
So now we come back to where bitcoin's value comes from.  There's no right answer here, but there are plenty of wrong answers.  If bitcoin becomes widely used as a transaction medium, that is "use case" that will create some floor for the value of bitcoins but actually not a terrible high one if you do the math.  The use of bitcoins for transactions does not itself make each bitcoin worth anything; in this case, bitcoins are simply tokens for the underlying payment network.  It's the network that generates the value.  The tokens would need some value for the payment system to work and would have value because people wouldn't immediately turn them into fiat.
The "bull" case for bitcoin is that it's use case as a store of value becomes real.  In that scenario, people want to hold substantial wealth in bitcoin and it could go "to the moon."  There's certainly an element of this already, just not very much.
Certainly speculation can and does drive the price of bitcoin, just as speculation drives the price of beanie babies and dogecoin and pogs.  But in each of these cases, the speculation produces no intrinsic value, and as soon as people decide to speculate on something else, the value can crash to zero.

Clearly you understand economics better than China's top economists.  Lolz.
The part you're missing is that economies (and markets) are path dependent.  Consider a typical medium sized company in the 2008 crisis.  The company in question is profitable, and solvent.  But, like most mid-sized companies, it relies on commercial paper and short-term debt for liquidity.  At the peak of the crisis, the commercial paper market completely froze.  The market ceased evaluating the credit worthiness of companies, and simply wouldn't lend money to anyone.  Period.  If the Fed hadn't stepped in, a huge number of profitable and solvent companies would have become bankrupt overnight because of a technical breach of debt covenants, resulting in mass layoffs and further bankruptcies.  Inaction would have turned profitable companies into dead companies, and employed and productive people into unemployed people for no good reason.  
There are similar issues with equity markets.  You want to let equities decline to "fair" value, but you want it to happen in an "efficient" way.  You don't want cascading margin calls that send equity far below fair value which can result in needless bankruptcies occurring for "technical" not fundamental reasons.  
The right balance is complex.  And I'm not saying that either China or the Fed got it right.  And there are problems with every government intervention.  But inaction produces wildly inefficient outcomes.

You make a lot of simple mistakes here.
First, to the investor, inflation is no different from loss in purchasing power via exchange rate change.  Bitcoin falling from $1100 to $200 was worse than any inflation the USD has ever seen.  There's literally no difference between loss in purchasing power because of inflation and loss of purchasing power because of exchange rate change.
Second, there's no difference between the way companies like facebook grew and companies like coinbase.  Both can focus on gathering users before then monetizing that user base many  years later, as long as they don't run out of cash.  As long as VCs keep funding coinbase and similar companies, running out of cash isn't an issue for the best bitcoin companies.

You think *average* block size is what matters?  We had a period of 3 days in September when confirmations took over 24 hours to confirm (5 of mine included).  But the bigger issue is that many people (engineers, investors, etc) are losing confidence in bitcoin's ability to innovate.  We're talking about a new technology.  Today, billion dollar companies, heck, even entire new industries are being born in less than a year.  Bitcoin is barely in beta mode and already struggling to make basic changes.  
You seem to have poor reading comprehension.  You somehow imagined that I "conceded I was wrong" somewhere.  What on earth are you smoking?

So let me dumb it down for you an I'll try to use small words.
Bitcoin has many potential use cases, including microtransactions.  Abandoning some of those use cases before an alternative (like lightning network) is in place would be foolish.  Bitcoin needs to maintain the flexibility of a new technology.  "Impatience" is a virtue.  New technologies that become "patient" get replaced - think friendster and myspace.  Or to put it even more simply: innovate or die.

The rise in price is not directly related to volatility.  Those are 2 separate phenomena.  The rise in price is wealth creating.  Volatility is a zero sum game (at best.)  
Speculation is not a use case.  You could go out and bet on red at the craps table or buy a random penny biotech stock.  Both are speculation.
If it turns that bitcoin produces a good risk-adjusted positive return for you, then it will have been a good investment.  We won't know that for sure until you sell your bitcoins and take profits.  Regardless, an investment in an asset isn't a use case of that asset, except as a store of value.
I am very well aware of the benefits of bitcoin for things like cross-border transfers.  But bitcoin isn't widely used for this.  It's a little bit used for gambling, you could maybe argue that in addition to darknets, it's proven successful as a use case for gambling and I wouldn't argue to hard.

That's actually a very new interpretation of the "freedom of speech" clause of the 1st amendment.  Initially it only protected speech that was explicitly political and directed at Congress.  Then it was expanded to all political speech, but even 50 years ago, it only protected explicitly political speech.  It did not protect art, or "lewd" speech, or hurtful/hateful speech.  Originally, it was purely meant to support the democracy by protecting speech disliked by those in power.  
I mention that, because I think of decentralization more similarly to the initial interpretation of freedom of speech - a means to an end, in our case, a means to things like censorship-resistance and robustness.  Currently, bitcoin is only used by a *tiny* community.  If bitcoin remains the plaything of only this tiny group, I don't much care whether it stays decentralized or not - it'll be meaningless either way.  We definitely don't want to sacrifice the soul of bitcoin for mass adoption, but that's why I've been trying to get at the specifics.  Would we be willing to increase centralization by 10% if it means a 5x increase in bitcoin's user base?  etc

No, you're making a simple mistake.  What you think is the foundation of the argument actually has no bearing.  Whether bitcoin started at $0 or extremely small (say $0.001), you'd draw identical conclusions in every real-world scenario.  You'd still call it the best performing currency in the world in all the same scenarios.  The only difference the $0 vs $0.001 makes is in whether you assign a gigantic percentage return or an infinite percentage return to it.

You seem to be confused about fiat, inflation, and exchange rate.
Literally all that matters is purchasing power.  Think of value as how much "stuff" you can buy with it, where "stuff" is defined as a generic basket of goods including cars, food, rent, clothing etc.  Inflation reduces the purchasing power of fiat, identically to how the purchasing power of bitcoin collapsed at the end of 2013.  All that matters is how much "stuff" you can buy with the fiat or bitcoin today relative to some point in the past.

Very early in the history of the US, we amended the constitution frequently.  We were in the habit of amendments, and passed many, even with the high barriers needed.  Over time we fell out of the habit, and now people generally consider it near impossible to pass a constitutional amendment.  So, instead, we rely on the supreme court to do things like create a right to abortion, a right to privacy, gay marriage rights.  In each case, the supreme court is overturning historical precedent and over ruling democratically elected legislatures and referendums.  While I support each of these changes, it would've been much better if they had been achieved via a constitutional amendment.  It would be more fundamentally democratic, more resilient (so if a couple new justices get placed on the bench, they can't easily and readily reverse all of those things.)   By falling out of the habit of amendments, we've come to see them as impossible.
Similarly, bitcoin has fallen out of the habit of aggressive innovation.  What was once routine is now seen as incredibly dangerous.  
One result of this is that the people that matter most (engineers and investors) are becoming increasingly skeptical that bitcoin will ever be able to scale.  Why invest years of your life in a technology that may stagnate, that may reject your improvements out of fear or politics?
New technologies and new industries can't afford patience.  It's a jungle, and it's "innovate or die."

No.  This ends up being worse than a zero sum game.  You're thinking of it that someone loses from the margin call, and someone wins.  But it's much worse than zero sum, it's massively value destroying.  When it happens in bitcoin, it erodes the value of the entire system, since bitcoin becomes less valuable as a store of value for investors, and less value as a medium of exchange for consumers because of the volatility.  When it happens in equities, it can lead to bankruptcies, layoffs, and national recessions with permanent losses in productivity.

As I explained, I gave a hypothetical simply to illustrate that bitcoin's start at $0 was arbitrary, and that it could instead have started like Etherium with a concrete market-driven non-zero exchange rate.  This really isn't rocket science.
"No. Any amount of Bitcoin is worth ∞ national fiat scrip. "  Lol, okay now I know you skipped probability 101 and economics 101 and political science 101.  
In economics, the fair value of an asset is one of two things depending on context.  It's A. current exchange value to a basket of goods (like clothing, rent, food, cars etc).  Or B. The present value of future cash flows.  Bitcoin produces no cash flows.  It has zero intrinsic value in an economic sense.  The "value" of bitcoin for its utility via transactions can be provided by a dozen other technologies, or even by the identical technology but via a different cryptocurrency.  This is why Warren Buffett compares bitcoin to the transaction technology underlying Visa, which can be replaced and rendered worthless at any time.
Second, you have to probability weight scenarios to come up with a fair value.  Bitcoin has a high chance of total failure, even if the idea itself is successful.  The NSA/Russia/Chinese government could easily destroy bitcoin whenever they want in a bunch of different ways.  They could spend $4 billion on ASICS and control the hashing power and another $100m on full nodes and control forks and block propagation.  For about $4.1 billion, anyone ultrarich person in the world can take control of bitcoin whenever they want.  But...they wouldn't even have to spend that much money.  A campaign of disinformation, bribing/coercing a couple bitcoin leaders, miners, and full node operators, and they'd have control of the network and could destroy it if they wanted.  
But you don't even need bitcoin to be destroyed.  Like many great new technologies/companies, it's likely to be replaced by something similar but better.  Think Facebook replacing myspace and friendster.  Bitcoin's technology has already been replicated by many altcoins, and it's economic moat is mediocre.  Most of the venture capital investment, mining infrastructure, and consumer software could be switched over from bitcoin to an altcoin almost overnight.  The reason it hasn't is because a marginally better altcoin won't replace bitcoin.  It would take something substantially better, which is likely to come along at some point.
Lastly, fiat will always have value as long as governments exist.  As government is defined as the entity with the legal monopoly on the legitimate use of force.  It's that use of force that enables governments to tax.  Taxes must be paid by fiat.  So even if you have a million bitcoins, you're going to jail unless you also have some fiat to pay your taxes.  For that reason, fiat will always have value.
Personally, I'm invested in bitcoin.  I think bitcoin has about a 1/3 chance of being a major success in 10 years, (worth $3000+), a 1/3 chance of being destroyed/replaced, and a 1/3 chance of remaining the dominant crypto but not growing much (probably worth $50-$1000).  When you probability-weight these outcomes, it still looks attractive.

You're just using two separate definitions of settlement to make bitcoin look better.  
If I want to spend bitcoin outside of the bitcoin network, I have to convert it to fiat, which takes time.  Most commonly, this is done via a site like Coinbase that requires 3 days for an ACH transfer.
Similarly if I want to use paypal funds outside of the paypal network, I have to ACH it to my bank which takes 3 days.

Boring if you don't like money.  Professional trader here.  If we're talking about a macroeconomic narrative or a growth stock or growth industry, we need the pricing data to match the story.  Bitcoin broke into public consciousness 2 to 3 years ago.  Mass VC investment started about 18 months ago.  In all that time, the bitcoin price can be described as sideways or down, but not as an upward trend.  Compare that to "success stories."  Sure I can cherry pick a date at which Amazon was higher than it is today, but only in the very recent past, since Amazon has been trending upward for 10 years.  When things trend strongly upward, by definition they must be higher today than they were a while ago.

You're still confused, my guess is because you aren't thinking through the ethereum example.  
In one of my examples, Satoshi *hypothetically* set the value of bitcoin by **bidding for bitcoin**  In other words, if Satoshi had said, I will buy all bitcoin you mine for $0.001 each, then bitcoin are worth at least $0.001 because there is a bid for them there.  That was one of the several ways I said that Satoshi **could** have initiated bitcoin with a non-zero value.  
The price of anything is not determined by where the most reluctant seller will sell, but rather where the *most motivated* seller will sell.  It doesn't matter if Satoshi values his bitcoin at $5,000 each.  Bitcoin is worth $450 because at this moment, there are currently more people willing to sell at $451 than there are people willing to buy it for $451.

I don't mind a fee market and higher fees. 
My concern is with the bitcoin community's unwillingness to innovate.  A lot of the rhetoric on this forum is that the community should reject any hard fork that doesn't have total consensus.  No hard fork will ever have total consensus.  So we're basically dooming bitcoin to stagnation.  Sooner or later we *will* encounter a problem that can only be solved by hard fork.  If bitcoin is too slow to react, it will be replaced, as all technologies and companies are, by something better or more flexible.
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:35:12
No, now you simply lack technical knowledge.  Microtransactions will only cause confirmation lags if blocks fill up.  I'm guessing that even you can guess a solution to that little problem.  Can you figure out why there's no contradiction?  Hint: There are currently lots of microtransactions on the blockchain since they can be included with fees of less than $0.01 and blocks aren't full, and if we want lots more microtransactions we just need bigger blocks.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:19:15
No, the issue here is the definition of "trend".  A trend is not simply two datapoints where one is higher than the other.  The whole idea of a trend is that there is some degree of consistency.  There's no exact definition, but it's easy to point to lots of things that *aren't* trends. 
You can **definitely** say that bitcoin has been trending upward over a 4 month and a 6 year time horizon.  The 1 year isn't an upward trend, because a very substantial part of that timeframe bitcoin was drifting lower.  There simply isn't a 1-year trend. Any chartist would subdivide the time frame into a multiple smaller trends.
So yes, bitcoin is currently trending upward on a short-time horizon, and it's trending upwards since inception.  But we should all be concerned that bitcoin's price has been stagnant or falling since it broke into public consciousness, despite all the VC funding, increase in transaction volume etc.

Nope.  Most regions of the world had long periods in every millennium going back 4 thousand years in which neither gold or silver were viewed as money.  Gold nuts like to pretend that gold has been money continuously for thousands of years, but it's just not true.  It's been intermittent at best.
And no, gold and silver fail many of the money tests today.  Consider portability.  Gold and silver were portable 100 years ago when people were making payments to their local butcher or regional governor.  Today, we frequently move money across the world, and in huge sums.  I'm an investor at a large pension.  Let's say I need to move $100 million to a hedge fund manager in Japan from the US.  Is gold really portable for me?  I'd have to transfer about 6,250 pounds of gold across the world.  That's certainly not "portable" in today's economic terms.  In contrast, I can move that fiat in about an hour using a wire transfer, or in 15 minutes with bitcoin.

Huh?  I just said the 6 year trend is real, and the 4-month upward trend is real.  Both real.  
There are all sorts of technical definitions that chartists uses for trends, the 1-year wouldn't pass any of them. 
As for which timeframe to focus on, that depends on your goals.  Does it make sense to place a lot of emphasis on the trending of the first 3 years of bitcoin's existence when discussing current issues?  I'd argue it doesn't, for commonsense economic reasons.  The rise from $0.10 to $10 were driven by entirely different economic issues than the rise from $100 to $1000.  And the fall from $1200 to $600 was driven by entirely different issues than this recent short-term fall from $440 to $390.  
So which timeframe should we care about?  I think the 4-month one matters - it might reflect a fundamental shift into bitcoin to evade Chinese inflation and/or capital controls, or perhaps simply a recovery to some kind of "fair value" that is maybe around the $400-$600 range that bitcoin seems drawn to.  
But I also think looking at the last 2 years or 18 months matters.  This is the time frame in which bitcoin exploded into public consciousness, tons of VC funding poured in, economic interests calcified, and the modern development landscape took shape.  It raises the question: if all of this stuff I just mentioned hasn't produce price appreciate in the last 18 months, why not?  And what will cause it to produce price appreciation in the next 18 months?  
I'm *not* implying that the VC funding *won't* eventually produce price gains.  Just that the burden is on us to explain why the next 18 months will different from the last 18.

You didn't answer my question.  There are lots of clear problems with bitcoin that are still unfixed.  Why haven't they been fixed?  Pointing at other changes doesn't answer that question.  
The question is rhetorical - they haven't been fixed because while the coding is relatively easy, the community won't accept changes.  Some of the problems I'm referencing - bitcoin remains susceptible to "spam" attacks that would instantly fill up blocks and delay confirmations, 75% of hash power is controlled by 3 Chinese dudes, the full node count continues to shrink, we're nearing a state where many blocks are full yet most users don't have access to dynamic fee wallets, etc etc
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:44:58
You're confusing how value originates from the price it starts at.  Consider Ether (Ethereum's crypto.)  It launched at a particular non-zero exchange rate.  This is common for many goods by the way.  Consider a newly discovered mineral in the ground.  The very first transaction that occurs to set the price of that mineral might be at $1 or $100 / oz.  It doesn't have to be at zero.  
So my reference to Satoshi was that he could have given bitcoin an initial value by doing the same thing as Etherium's and providing an initial peg (that he would be willing to exchange it at) vs fiat or gold.  If Satoshi announced on day 1 that he would personally buy bitcoins from anyone for 10,000 BTC per dollar, then BTC would have had an initial non-zero value.  Or, he could have structured mining such that miners would have to pay fiat or pay gold or something to generate bitcoins, which would similarly define a non-zero value for them.
To be clear - your statement that value requires two people willing to trade is correct, it's just irrelevant to this case, since many (in fact nearly all goods and many cryptocurrencies) are launched such that the first valuation is non-zero.

Technical definitions get somewhat complex.  Some rules I've seen for algorithmic trading take the form of: 
Subdivide the timeframe into Y subsections
There is an upward trend if: 
   - 80% of the sample Ys have higher ending than starting points
     and 
   - there is no more than 1 pair of Ys separated by 1 interval in   
     which the end of the 2nd Y is lower than the start of the first Y
If we used 10 Ys in this example, I think the 4 month and 6 year would pass this test, but the 1-year would not.
Just one example among many.  Exactly thresholds are certainly arbitrary, but at the extremes you get near total consensus among market observers.

"When did I say they are not there?"
You said over and over and over that  microtransactions don't work on the blockchain.  You gave numerous reasons why they're horribly inefficient and unsecure.  And yet, a large percentage of transactions on the blockchain *are* microtransactions.  So now you need to backtrack and argue why what works on bitcoin today won't work for bitcoin in the future.  I certainly agree that things change and the counterfactual can't be assumed (i.e. just because microtransactions work today doesn't mean they'll work in 5 years.)  But you can't talk about microtransactions on the blockchain are terrible over and over and over without explicitly explaining why they work fine today but won't work in the future.
No, physical merchants are irrelevant.  I gave one example of a physical merchant.  The exact same statements apply to online merchants like Amazon.  Amazon - free, unquestioned returns on most items.  Why aren't they scammed constantly?

I'm not plugged into the technicals, but my limited understanding is all of the core efforts that you describe are very marginal.  How many additional nodes do we expect to be run off of those changes?  If node count is really at the center of the debate, I'd expect to see more substantive suggestions to increase node count 5x or whatever, like ways to compensate people somehow.  The whole node discussion seems strangely wishy washy.  What is the goal?  What is a lower limit for tolerable node counts?  Is 5000 nodes okay?  What about 15000?  Or 25000?  I think everyone agrees that more nodes are better.  People like Gavin just counter that the marginal value is very low, and so sacrificing things like low fees isn't a worthwhile tradeoff.  But that's wishy-washy too.

You have it backwards.  Settlement is purely a means to an end, use is important.  Consider an imaginary altcoin with instant irreversible settlement (so, it's better than bitcoin with bitcoin's doublespend risks or long confirmation times.)  But...no exchange and no merchant will accept the altcoin.  So you can settle it instantly, but can't do anything with it.  Does that altcoin sound valuable to you?  Would you pay much for it?  
Remember also that settlement is a double edged sword.  While merchants tend to prefer faster settlement, consumers prefer the opposite.  I **love** that credit cards and paypal will let me reverse a transaction if I buy a watch online and the merchant mails me an empty box.  Faster and irreversible settlement isn't inherently good.  It's fantastic for some specific use cases, bad for others.
This is a big part of why bitcoin hasn't taken off more with consumers.

Segwit is great, but a bandaid.  Hearn was a great developer who volunteered years of life to improve bitcoin.  Seeing top engineers grow pessimistic on bitcoin's future is very bad.

You simply got the timeline backward.  You said micropayaments were never meant to be posted directly to the blockchain.  Except that initially they were.  The idea of payment channels came later.  I agree with everything else you wrote (in terms of satoshi not being god and the whitepaper being just a start).  You simply made a mistake in confusing what was initially meant to be with new ideas that came about later.  This isn't particularly important.  I was just pointing out that payment channels were a later idea. 
More importantly you're confusing impatience for dealing with problems.  We have at our disposal numerous ways to scale bitcoin.  Why stick your fingers in your ears indefinitely waiting for a particular piece of code that might arrive in the future?  Why not make use of the solutions you have now, and make use of future solutions in the future?  
You're like a guy who's house is on fire, and who says, "I'm gonna wait until the fire station buys that cool new fire truck next month."  It's stupid of course.  You use the current tools to put out the fire, then when the next fire happens you use the cool new fire truck, if it's available.

You make a lot of simple mistakes in here.  First, consumers and merchants don't necessarily have any exposure to BTC price at all.  There's a ton of ways to almost instantly convert fiat to BTC and back such that you are never meaningfully exposed to price volatility.  Bitpay does this automatically for example.
Second, there's massive demand for a *good* darknet type market.  Massive.  The issues with the existing darknet markets is that all the big ones either get shut down by the US government or get exit scammed by their owners.  Open Bazaar solves both these problems.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:25:44
You're that confident you know what provides value for bitcoin users?  Funny.  Most top business leaders and investors think that evolving technologies often surprise us in how exactly they provide value.  That's why you see so much flexibility in successful startup companies.  
So far, bitcoin is only good for darknet markets.  It hasn't been widely adopted for anything else.  Artificially restricting bitcoin's capability at this point makes no sense.  Let's let it develop and see just how users want to use it.

This is incorrect.  Bitcoin was *much* more volatile than the Canadian dollar last year.  Bitcoin fell from $300 to below $200 (a more than 1/3 fall), then rallied to $500, a more than 150% rally.  The Canadian dollar didn't get anywhere near that kind of volatility.

We're basically talking about two separate use cases then, and you're simply using the term differently than most people.  I agree that the blockchain is very inefficient for transactions &lt;$0.10, and can definitely not support them long-term.  But "microtransaction" also refers to *much* larger payments.  There's no hard limit.  The wikipedia entry defines a microtransaction as facilitating micropayments, which Visa defines as &lt;$20, Paypal as &lt;$5 and many others as &lt;$1.  I don't think $20 or even $5 fits the micropayment title, since credit cards (and merchants) already willingly handle those efficiently.  I'd use something around $1 as a cut-off point.  
For transactions of say, $0.40, to buy single day access to the NYT, bitcoin is currently excellent and can remain excellent indefinitely.

I'm not following your logic.  Are you arguing that the # of nodes today is just fine and dandy, but a reduction in node count, of say 30%, would be such a huge problem that we're willing to hamstring the network to avoid it?  That makes it sound like bitcoin relies on a very precise number of full nodes and any more than that is useless and even a bit less is a huge problem.

Lol.  He didn't claim "bitcoin has failed because people saw through his tactics."  He claims bitcoin failed because:
"It has failed because...what was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.
Think about it. If you had never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that:
Couldn’t move your existing money
Had wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising fast
Allowed buyers to take back payments they’d made after walking out of shops, by simply pressing a button (if you aren’t aware of this “feature” that’s because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it)
Is suffering large backlogs and flaky payments
… which is controlled by China
… and in which the companies and people building it were in open civil war?
I’m going to hazard a guess that the answer is no."

Okay, you're identifying what most people call the problems of centralization as "symptoms."  Fine.  We all agree that we want bitcoin to be decentralized, and we all agree on the problems (or "symptoms") of centralization.
But none of this deals with my original question.  If we (and the core devs) aren't willing to do anything to *increase* decentralization, then why are we willing to hamstring the network to avoid a moderate *decrease* in decentralization.  Why the asymmetry?  As you note, "regulatory attacks" by Coinbase are already here.  Does this mean we should be reducing the blocksize to 0.5 MB?  Or 100 KB?  Or at the very least, if we actually believe that there's a strong connection between node count and the strength of the network, shouldn't the core devs be focusing on new implementations that will increase node count (not just avoid decreasing)? 
In other words, why the asymmetry?  Why are we doing nothing to increase node count yet willing to hamstring the network to avoid a small decrease?  Don't the same arguments in favor of avoiding a 2 MB block size work towards a 0.5 MB blocksize?

Bitcoin is in beta.  It hasn't yet succeeded for anything other than darknet purchases.  There's not yet a single other successful use case. 
Bitcoin as a technology will continue evolving, as will its marketing and user base.  *We don't know* if bitcoin will become a broader success and if so which use cases will dominate.  But one thing's for sure, if we pigeon-hole the technology early and let bitcoin ossify, it's chances of ultimately success and value fall precipitously.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:43:21
I agree with almost all of this except your last paragraph goes off the rails.
Eventually bitcoin miners have to be paid with transactions, but that day is still a looooong way away.  The block reward is still huge.  
More importantly the link between fees and centralization, and between centralization and insecurity is tenuous and ambiguous.  You're just throwing out dogmatic terminology without thinking it through.  How many nodes do you estimate will drop out with a 2 MB blocksize?  How many more nodes would there be with a 0.5 MB blocksize?  What is the practical difference between 2k, 4k, 6k, 10k, and 20k nodes?  At what point does a fall in node count become more dangerous?  If node count is so critical and so closely tied to blocksize, why aren't more people with views like yourself advocating for a *decrease* in blocksize?
One of the best ways to increase bitcoin's security is by continuing it's growth and adoption.  More users/investors likely means more full nodes, and means a higher bitcoin exchange rate, which incentivizes more investment in hash power.

I doubt it.  The trend towards extreme aggression against people advocating a larger blocksize seems to be a coordinated effort between Blockstream employees and theymos.

I don't know for sure, but I'd bet lay 2:1 odds that theymos has an economic incentive.

You're confusing thinking with feeling.   "I think" often preceedes statements of logic and fact, it's just a slightly more humble way to do it.  For example, I can say, "I think the Universe is between 5 billion and 20 billion years old."  The next sentence could reference dozens of peer reviewed astrophysics publications and the logic presented by top astronomers.  
I presented a clear line of inductive reasoning.  As with all inductive reasoning, it isn't "proof."  But that's not the burden in a discussion like this.  If I see a swan and it appears black, I can say, "I think that swan is black because I see its left side and it's black."  It's true that the right side of the swan might be white.  And you could argue that.  But my inductive line of reasoning that since every swan I've ever seen is the same color on both it's left and right side, and since I can see the left side of swan is black, then we can combine the two facts to form strong evidence that the entire swan is black.
Lastly, when an individual accuses authority of acting in an opaque and conspiratorial manner.  I don't claim I have all the facts - partly since the facts are being actively censored and distorted by those I'm accusing.  What I can do is point to patterns of highly suspicious behavior.  The burden of proof is on those doing the censoring to prove beyond a reasonable doubt why it's necessary, and not conspiratorial in nature.  This is the burden the supreme court places on the government on speech censorship, and it's a political value that the vast majority of bitcoin enthusiasts hold.

@_date: 2015-11-25 16:00:36
I think it's relevant since there's a big "faction" that's strongly directing the evolution of bitcoin in opaque ways.

The technology that survives often isn't the best, but the one that achieves critical network effects first.  Why do you think internet explorer was the dominant internet browser for so long?
For us bitcoin investors, we certainly have to hope this is the case, since bitcoin is very clearly a mediocre technology.  10+ minute transaction confirmation times?  A network that can be easily stalled and disrupted with dust transactions?  A block size that can't support even a tiny fraction of the transactions necessary if bitcoin is to gain broader support?
Let's hope the mediocre tech that is bitcoin is the one that wins.

This is highly inaccurate.  You could make a similar argument that Shakespeare is just a string of letters.  It's literally true but misleading and stupid.  Bitcoin as an asset and currency includes the concept of ownership.  A specific bitcoin (aka an unspent output) can be traced back to its mining.  Whoever controls the private key owns the unspent output and owns the bitcoin in a practical sense, although local laws still apply; i.e. if you steal my paper wallet, a court may seize your assets to repay me for my stolen bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:29:06
You're not arguing with anything I said.  Based on your prior analysis, you could not have sold at $420, because you did not yet know if that price level would "repel" or if bitcoin would "break through" which would make you further bullish.  The worthless TA analysis says, "either this price will be a good sell, or we'll go through it and it will be a good buy, and we won't know which until after the move has been made." 
Good TA says, "this price **will** repel.  There will be no breakthrough at least not for a certain amount of time."

What monopoly position?  You can put your money in any of a hundred banks at any time.  And no, it's not their money.  With bitcoin, whoever controls the private key controls the coins, which is why so many people have been robbed of so many coins with no recourse.  Man in the middle attacks, transaction malleability, etc.  With money in a bank, you actually have a whole legal system protecting you.  If you're defrauded, you're highly likely to get your money back, unlike with bitcoin where the odds are near zero.
I like bitcoin, but let's be honest about its pros and cons.

Not true.  The same clearing mechanism that exists for a $1,000 wire transfer exists for a billion dollar transfer.  You are literally transferring the electronic money from one bank to another.  The only extra "complication" from the larger sized transfer is the bank will want to perform extra manual checks to prevent fraud.

This is simply untrue.  Theymos has publicly stated numerous times that any discussion of the evolution of bitcoin that includes larger blocksizes will be censored because he views it as off-topic as an "alt coin discussion."

Are people still propagating this myth?  The blockchain has almost nothing to do with bitcoin as has already been well established.  The blockchain can be implemented with 1 second blocks instead of 15 minute blocks.  And unlike with the bitcoin blockchain, a simple spam attack won't necessarily hold up confirmations for 24+ hours.  
The only benefit of a bitcoin based blockchain is decentralization.  Now, that's a very important benefit to some people, but completely meaningless for most applications. 
Blockchains are already being implemented for use with other currencies (including USD), as well as in a wide variety of non-monetary applications.

Aren't many things both?  For example, if I say, "For this list of 15 reasons, I think we should reverse the affordable care act, because it had these 5 negative effects etc."  That is certainly a discussion of an idea, since it weighs and debates specific evidence and arguments.  It's also promoting an act.  
Similarly, every single time I've seen someone promote XT in a comment longer than a paragraph, it's been as part of a discussion of the idea and its specifics.  
Regardless, it's not like censorship of promoting adoption is any better.  It's still censorship of a viewpoint he doesn't like.  Anathema to the ideals of most bitcoin enthusiasts, and anathema to what bitcoin stands for.

You get a clear contradiction with this logic though, especially in an illiquid market like bitcoin.  What causes the repelling?  People like me selling.  Using your definition, you'll never profit from the repelling because by the time you identify it, you're too late, and by the time the breakthrough is confirmed, bitcoin might have already completed it's next move.

I think there are lots of smart, well-intentioned, honorable people who just happen to favor a smaller block size.  But when you're advocating for bitcoin, an experiment that we all champion specifically because of its censorship-resistance and decentralized nature, and you seek to control the debate about its evolution through censorship, that is bad faith by definition to me.

Are you opposed to AML in theory or in practice?  Honestly, I've never thought about that issue very much.  I've thought about privacy a lot; I'm a fan of Snowden, but I've never thought much about AML specifically.  There are a lot of scenarios where AML seems legitimate to me.  For example, if we're actively at war with a country or drug cartel or terrorist cell, seizing their foreign assets is a legitimate and important part of the battle.  It's also an important way to prevent corrupt politicians from looting their countries.

Of course.  You can't be upset at someone for following the law of their jurisdiction, especially if they're a regulated institution.  If you think AML laws are unjust, fight to have them changed.  Until they're changed, every bank, and every money transmitting and converting company must and will follow them, or they'll be shut down.
99% of the time, when you disagree with a law, you obey it and fight to change it.  If the law is incredibly immoral, then perhaps we must practice civil disobedience.  Civil disobedience against AML is not a good enough reason to go to jail or have a good chunk of the bitcoin infrastructure shut down.

Agree, except with the last sentence.  I think it's relevant because it may diminish the competitive advantage of bitcoin.  Bitcoin has a ton of features.  One of those powerful competitive advantages is the ability to transfer money across country borders almost for free.  That's a huge advantage currently compared to a wire transfer or western union.  If banks get their act together and start offering the equivalent of a wire transfer for $0.10 and conducted in 1 hour, that erodes or eliminates a key benefit of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:23:25
The report suggests that the big disparity comes from pension obligations.  I haven't dug into those numbers, but that makes intuitive sense to me.  It's likely that the increase in government compensation is only for long tenured employees who are accruing increasingly large retirement obligations.  The private sector routinely faces similar issues, but that gets disrupted by periodic bankruptcies at large companies.

I was saying gold is very unlikely to become worthless tomorrow, that's why people think it is a store of value.  In contrast, we recently saw bitcoin lose 80% of its value.  We also saw bitcoin come under a spam attack that destroyed its ability to conduct transactions for more than 24 hours.  And alternative cryptocurrencies are invented every week.  And of course, the NSA could destroy bitcoin whenever it wanted, which they couldn't do for the market of gold.
"Expected value will always be positive when investing, or else you would now make that investment."  You're phrasing is really strange here.  We rarely know ahead of time what the expected value is.  For a very diversified basket of productive assets, we can make a reasonable assumption that expected value is positive.  For example, it's generally reasonable to assume that expected value for global equities will be positive over a 10 year time period.  You're certainly right that people won't buy an asset unless they think the expected value is positive, but most assets have both people long it and people short it.  There are currently people investing in bitcoin and people shortselling bitcoin.  The latter think bitcoin's expected value is negative.  We can't say who is right ahead of time.  
Fine wine is actually viewed as an investment by many people.  It's appreciated relatively gradually over the last 80 years, and is relatively uncorrelated to equities.  Same with fine art.  I would argue it's not an investment because it's unproductive, so it's speculative (best compared to a commodity bet, like oil futures).  
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:37:53
No...they obviously couldn't do that for gold.  The reason it'd be easy with bitcoin is that it's unlikely the host country of mining pools would care, the people who run them have no political power, they'd have popular and legal cover that it's just investigating terrorists, and it's highly centralized.

You're making a strange dichotomy.  According to wikipedia, a blockchain is just a particular type of database.  If you have a database that is distributed across computers, that uses cryptographic signing to prevent tampering with previous records, and that maintains a full and growing list of all preceding transactions, then it's a blockchain.
Asking why we need a blockchain when we already have databases is like asking why anyone would need a toyota when cars already exist.

You can't buy bitcoins if the network doesn't propagate.  At best someone can give you a private key, but they still hold that private key.  Bitcoins aren't solely yours until you move them, and you can't move them without a network.

No, bank runs aren't tied to fractional reserve banking, and they were far more common before the invention of the Federal Reserve, since depositor's insurance gives depositors a lot of confidence.  Even if a bank swears they have 100% of the gold in reserve, they could still face a run if depositors don't believe them.  Yes, bitcoin could help in this very limited scenario.
Credit is a critical part of all economies.  Without it, you have a Marxist world where only those who already own capital can produce anything (and even the best producers are limited in their ability to grow, produce more jobs and goods, etc).  Credit allows the entrepreneur to start a business, or the brilliantly profitable business to expand more quickly.  Obviously wonderful things for the economy and society at large.
 
So then the question is who should be extending the credit?  Traditional commercial lending (taking in deposits and making loans), is directly tied to fractional reserve banking.  It's how savers get to earn interest on their savings.  If instead you mandated that loans can only come in the form of bond sales, you'd be very dramatically reducing the amount of credit available as a percentage of societal wealth, and that would dramatically retard growth.  When I wrote "natural conduit", I was specifically commenting on the free market element of commercial banking.  I'd rather the credit creation happen by private banks responding to market signals then by the federal or state governments or a central bank.  
FRB did indeed start because of the friction of moving gold, but that's not why it continues even long after gold became irrelevant.  It continues because credit is the lifeblood of our economy, and FRB seems to be one of the best ways to create it.  
Here's another way of thinking about it.  We have a huge pile of wealth in the form of gold or USD or bitcoins.  You can choose between A. have it sit static in a vault.  Or B. have it loaned and invested in the creation of new companies, new factories, new scientific research etc.  The latter will produce much more economic growth that leads to higher quality of life, at the risk of the occasional 2008 credit crisis.

Oh man, so much confusion in one post.  First, the vast majority of people disagreeing with you aren't selling anything.  I'm on this forum because I own bitcoin.  My job has nothing to do with blockchain tech.  
Second, the thing that people are trying to help you understand is why so many big institutions are exploring blockchain tech.  Do you really think the teams at Phillips and JPMorgan and Bank of America and the Federal Reserve, and General Electric are all idiots?  Or maybe they see specific value in the technology that is valid?
The basic mistake you're making is creating a false dichotomy.  It's like someone invents the wheel and you're whining that someone is using that to build a wheelbarrow and you want them to be making chariots.  Both have value, for different purposes, to different users.  
And the argument that the same benefits could be achieved with their existing relationships is like saying that people don't need bitcoin because they could just use "Bit Gold", which was created before bitcoin, or they could use litecoin etc.  The fact that you can accomplish a task through method C doesn't mean that method B isn't great, and possibly more efficient.

No one ever argued that the blockchain isn't a database, and can't be replicated with existing technology.  The novelty of the blockchain is that it's a different usage of de-localized databases from what generally prevails today.

The blockchain wasn't a new technological discovery, it was more like a new framing of good database practice.

Another way to phrase my objection - if I had waited for a confirmation of the repel at $420 to sell, I would've been selling $20 lower since the repel was violent and fast, and at that point, the risk/reward for a potential buyback at $385 would not have been attractive.

The cryptographic signing means that literally only 1 party has the private key associated with a transaction.  That's what makes it so easy to prove.  We prove it every time we sign an encrypted email or transfer a bitcoin, or decrypt a file.

Of course not, that's my point.  They could obviously hijack the banking network within their own countries as we saw in 2008 though.  Russia can do whatever they want with Russian banks, but has little influence over Chinese banks.  In contrast, Russia alone could destroy bitcoin tomorrow if they wanted.  Heck, Bill Gates alone could destroy bitcoin tomorrow if he wanted in half a dozen different ways.  He could simply buy $2 billion in ASICS and have complete control over the network, or more cheaply he could bribe the biggest mining pool operators to create mass confusion by mining blocks with fake transactions while spreading disinformation.

A few ways.  The cheapest and most effective would be to take control of a few of those big mining pool operators via bribery/coercion/hacking and throw the network into disarray (launch double spending attacks, empty blocks etc).  The most important part would be to simultaneously start a campaign of disinformation.  The NSA would co-opt a couple of the most trusted bitcoin thought leaders (again through bribery or coercion) as well as spreading disinformation in forums and articles so that people like you and I wouldn't know who to trust or what was going on.  Miners wouldn't know which chain to build on, which pool could be trusted etc.  They could also shut down the big exchanges with a mix of bribery/coercion/hacking/FBI raids.  This would be the "elegant" approach and wouldn't cost them much time or money.
The less elegant approach would be to brute force it.  It might take them a year but they could easily spend a few billion dollars to construct 70%+ of the hashing power of the network.  They then simply control the bitcoin network.  This latter way could actually be done by any large government and even a few very wealthy individuals.  The latter wouldn't have any incentive to do so.  For the NSA, or China, or Russia, spending $5 billion to destroy bitcoin might well look attractive.

You just want to do away with fractional reserve banking.  That has little to do with bitcoin.  Banks could be sitting on vaults filled with gold, or cash, or paintings.  
Fractional reserve banking is a good thing imo.  It creates a natural conduit for credit creation.  And while it produces greater systemtic risks, as you note, bank runs did indeed used be a common occurrence and led to many people losing their life savings.

Nah, this is a really common misconception.  You can structure 100 other incentives.  For example, the incentive could simply be continued participation in the network.

We're talking about "store of value" and you think 2 years is a long time?  Do you understand the premise of the discussion?  The whole idea is that people might not want to hold USD because of a fear of inflation or depreciation.  Even if inflation in the US was running at 20% annually, that's still less than the volatility that bitcoin has experienced in individual weeks in the past 6 months.  To be attractive as a "store of value", people have to trust that an asset is likely to be more stable than the USD over a period of years.  I think that might eventually happen with bitcoin, but it's certainly a very long way away.

Yes I mean local geographically.  The vast majority of assets and wealth are physical things located in a particular geographical spot.  As for enforcing geography on the internet, it's certainly harder but many countries manage to do it most of the way.  China has pretty tight controls on its internet usage.  It's possible to VPN/proxy around those controls, but then your connection will be substantially slowed.  
"us guys" get what the technology represents.  We understand that bitcoin and the blockchain have a huge variety of applications, features, and limitations.  What you don't seem to get is that for some purposes, you only need a few of the specific features.  Big banks can make excellent use of some specific aspects of the blockchain, but have no use for bitcoin.  The reason I brought up the local aspect, was that for most institutions, they are relying on national laws whether they like it or not for their existence.  If US bank wants to do business with a brazilian bank, they can certainly use bitcoin for the international transaction.  But the US bank is already relying on US laws for its very existence, and the Brazilian bank is effectively subject to those laws as well, since they almost certainly have some US assets that could be seized by US courts.  So doing the transaction in bitcoin doesn't add much value - the two banks already have a trust mechanism in place, US law.  
Where the trust mechanism of bitcoin adds huge value is for people who don't currently have a trust mechanism in place...mostly criminals.  That's why you've seen bitcoin quickly adopted by drug dealers and child pornographers, while it's been very slow to be adopted for legal commercial use.

The author makes some common mistakes.  First off is assuming that tokens are the only incentives available.  There are lots of possible incentives, including being allowed to continue participating in a consortium that's using the private chain.  Second is misunderstanding that the "tamper proof" element of a blockchain doesn't come from the mining, but from the cryptographic signature.  Plenty of other mistakes in there too.

One of the most interesting applications of the blockchain to me is proof of ownership (like with deeds to houses).  I agree, if such things were widely used in 2008 it would've been helpful.  That aspect has nothing to do with bitcoin though.  
As for time-locked bitcoin loans - how would this work?  Presumably the person borrowing the bitcoin wants to spend it to some end (they don't want to just hold an asset and pay interest on it.)  The vast majority of bank borrowers are looking to spend the money they receive on something, whether real estate, farm equipment, etc.  The business of lending is inherently risky, and I don't see that as a flaw.  That's just part of the business.  You can't eliminate the risk of bank loans without eliminating the risk of the activities they support.  Some of the risk comes from poor record keeping or ambiguous contracts as you point out, but a lot comes from the economic activity itself.

Do you seriously think trust is binary?  Have you ever worked in finance, or in any deal making role?  Banks trust each other like 95%.  Simple fraud is almost non-existent, but mistakes are common and more subtle fraud between banks does happen albeit rarely.  Having a cryptographically secure ledger with every transaction recorded transparently makes it far easier to track the long path a typical financial transaction takes, and to analyze any disagreements that may arise.  
The key point to understand here is that big institutions trust the legal system to enforce straightforward contracts, so simple egregious fraud isn't a common problem.  If someone tries to blatantly violate a blockchain related contract, it's easy to drag them to a US court and enforce it.  The problem for banks today is that often when there's a discrepancy, it's immensely complex and opaque.  One bank claims one thing, another claims something else, and it requires 3 years and an army of lawyers to litigate the complex issue.

If banks can't use bitcoin in a levered/debt way, they won't accept it at all.  But of course they can.  They would just use derivatives.  And then if/when the bank fails, you get the same general economic results as would've happened in 2008, and whatever bitcoins you had at the bank are, at a minimum, tied up in legal battles for half a decade.  The extent to which the nation's wealth reside out of banks would be directly proportional to the drag on the economy from reduced commercial lending.  You can have autonomy from banks, or you can have a working modern economy.  You can't have both.

It's not a coincidence, but I think the link is a bit more subtle.  I've actually thought a ton about this in a lot of different contexts.  For example, there are dozens of prominent, very well respected, brilliant climatologists who say global warming isn't happening, while 95% of their peers disagree.  Is this 5% lying?  Have they been bought by big oil money?  Maybe some of them, but I think at least a few are genuine.  
Among smart, well-intentioned people, there is more disagreement then we tend to appreciate on almost every issue you can consider.  These people end up in particular positions of power based on those views.  So the half dozen climatologists who genuinely believe global warming isn't happening end up getting huge funding from big oil to do research and publish.  
Similarly, what kind of man becomes CEO of Haliburton?  Certainly not a pacifist and probably not a far-left liberal.  Probably someone with a naturally neoconservative worldview.  Then when that person becomes VP, that same worldview informs their decisions as VP.

If it's decentralized too, then it's a blockchain.  That's literally the definition of blockchain.

The most widely known application of a block chain is the public ledger of transactions for cryptocurrencies used in bitcoin. This record is enforced cryptographically and hosted on machines running the software."

OP, you made a mistake in your second paragraph.  The attractiveness of an asset depends not only on its expected value, but also its riskiness (measured as either volatility or probability of permanent loss.)  
Almost all professional investors agree that over the long run, a diversified basket of equities will outperform treasury bonds.  Yet many still choose to hold treasury bonds.  Why?  Because depending on the utility curve of  the particular investor, they may prefer a guaranteed return of 1% over a risky expected return of 7%.

This really depends on the specifics.  In the example of a bank consortium, the real answer is the existing legal framework.  Lots of bitcoin users love the trustless aspect of it, but that particular feature isn't important to big institutions interacting with one another.  So I could imagine the 30 biggest banks in the world all signing traditional legal contracts to use a blockchain in a particular way.  
As for exit scams, isn't it roughly the same penalty in a PoW system?  Let's say I control 10% of the hashing power in a network and want to do a big exit scam.  One penalty for doing that is the value of the network will be reduced, and I have a big investment in mining equipment.  Similarly, if you're 1 of the 30 banks in the consortium, the exit scam reduces the value of that consortium (and possibly the industry as a whole), and you have a lot invested into your institution.

I think that when he coordinates his rhetoric and censorship with the blockstream devs, and the same censorship is applied to the forum as the dev listserve, that they're clearly coordinating their bad faith efforts imposing their views on others.  Since we know the blockstream incentive (profit for their company), it's likely that the other people mimicking their specific bad faith actions are also being economic incentivized one way or another.

No, the wire transfer market is competitive.  The high fees reflect high costs to provide it.  The reason it takes so long to complete a wire transfer is because all cross-border money transfers have to be cleared through 2 central banks, and the service providers face huge regulatory overhead.   
Bitcoin doesn't solve the permissionless issue, it just provides an easier way to skirt the law.  If I want to convert my fiat to bitcoin, both I, and the service provider are still subject to regulation.  The issue is that with bitcoin it's easier to get away with skirting that regulation.

When Bear Stearns failed, every other large US bank would have failed within 2 months if the Federal Reserve had not intervened.  This is because of the implicit leverage in the system.  For example, Goldman Sachs has a market capitalization of $77 billion, but counterparty agreement over more than $5 trillion.  So when one large counterparty defaults on their debt to Goldman, Goldman is immediately unable to make good on its agreemnts to Morgan Stanley, who then can't make good on their debts to Bank of America, etc.  It's a domino cascade.

That's actually objectively false.  The bank is a fiduciary (aka caretaker) of your money.  It is yours legally.  If the bank refuses to give it to you, you take them to court they will be ordered to do so.  If they refuse, a judge will issue a lien against their property.  If they still refuse, a sheriff will literally accompany you to the bank to seize their assets (like their computers).  
Banks freeze accounts for a bunch of reasons.  Most common is simple technical error.  They are legally obligated to unfreeze it as quickly as they are able, the same way if you take your car into an autoshop, it might take them a little while to find your keys if they misplaced them.  They are also legally required to freeze your account if the US government suspects you of money laundering.  Lastly, they freeze accounts when ordered to by courts, such as when you owe a debt and a debt collector gets a judge to grant an order to a bank to freeze your account so they can collect money is that is rightfully theirs.
As for banks failing to make true on claims: Banks are legally obligated to make true on all deposits.  If they can't, they must declare bankruptcy like any other business that fails to pay its debts.  The Federal Reserve insures all deposits up to $250,000, so if the bank is unable to "make true" on your checking account, the Federal Reserve must.

Most things that are thought of as stores of value don't lose 80% of their value in a span of a few months and can't be relatively easily destroyed by the NSA.

It's not really a joke.

Well articulated, thanks.

It's a public data set being analyzed using basic statistical tools.  You can review the methodology yourself.
Regardless, any analysis has to be performed by *someone* either someone in the private or public sector.  You can always accuse everyone of bias.  It's not meaningful unless you can point to where you think the bias impacted the analysis.

You're contradicting yourself.  You first say that TA doesn't tell you anything about *what* will happen at $420, then you say it tells you that $420 provides a good short position risk/reward which implies you think there's a greater chance of the a repel than a breakthrough of equal size.  
What you *could* say based on this logic is that if the price has moved from $330 to $350 and the next critical level is $420, that you like buying $350 with a stop-loss at $329 and a limit sell offer at $419.
My problem with most TA predictions that they rely on this kind of confirmed breakthrough that renders the prediction useless.  By the time you get a confirmation of the $420 break, you might well be half way to the next resistance point.

And bitcoin wasn't the first cryptocurrency....being first is rarely relevant in either the finance or tech space.

You did notice that the comparison isn't between similar jobs right?  It's like saying, "government employed doctors make more than private sector employed secretaries."  It's comically stupid.  What you need to do is compare the salary of people with the same jobs in private and public sector.  And if you do that, you find private sector pays a bit more.

This is incorrect.  The kind of blockchains they're looking at using are not "inefficient forms of bitcoin", they're unrelated to bitcoin, and far more efficient for their purpose.  Bitcoin is horribly inefficient for many purposes.  15 minute + transaction confirmation times, billions in hardware solving meaningless math problems, etc.

Do you not realize that you're an internet rando too?  How are people this dumb?
And you don't even realize that bitcoin evolves by seasoned bitcoin developers submitting hard fork recommendations.  ...

Dow theory has been statistically debunked.  As have most technical charting methods.  They have zero predictive power.  Very easy to test statistically these days since you can program in simple backtests.
Applying a more "common sense" idea of a trend: if a price goes from $150 to $295 and then $220 and then $250 and then $220 and then $250, that price action is sitting in a range.  If you were to measure the # of moves up vs down, or the size of the moves up vs down, you get nearly identical results.  Or here's another way to put it: look at the chart between Jan15 and today.  Look at the volume (price x amount of time) above the current price and below the current price.  They're roughly equal.  We're close to the middle of the range we've been bouncing back and forth in.

Game theory.  It's not 1 entity buying.  It's not like there's one dude propping the price up.  Everyone wants to buy the cheapest price possible, but also fears on missing out.  Imagine if every person with a car simply stopped buying gasoline for 3 days.  The price would plummet and then you could get it cheaper.  But how do you coordinate that with 100 million other consumers?

You're ignoring a pretty big part of the equation.  Even if bitcoin became the dominant financial asset in the world - you'd still have other assets - like houses, cars, real estate, etc.  
Banks using bitcoin would have made little difference in 2008; the problem wasn't that we couldn't value their fiat holdings, it was that we couldn't value their real estate holdings.

Did you mean to say, "confirmed **that this is** someone...
Your poor command of english aside, bitcoin's current very low value (less than 5% the total value of Uber's stock for example) is where it is because bitcoin currently provides very little value.  I hope that changes.
