You can try us. We offer Bitcoins via Western Union, and have been around a few years. We're also VERY fast, and our rates are THE best.
We're the premiere Bitcoins-via-WesternUnion solution. Your coins in an hour or less. And WE eat the Western Union fees. No hidden charges or fees.
Doesn't get easier then that! Feel free to Google our track record. Satisfying customers for over 1 year.

We are open and taking orders as of 6:20am EST Friday, May 10th. We will only be charging a small 4% fee on each Bitcoin orders today! That's it. No hidden fees, no fine print. (Lowest of any cash-to-BTC trader). And remember, WE cover the Western Union fee. Shoot us an email.

Right. We are TOR based. But we are very active on Silk Road and you can Google our ratings/feedback. Thanks!

Sorry Jesset, didn't know that was frowned upon! Will not re-post. For say.. another week? Is once a week fair?

Yes, we are NOT sold out of BTC. We have enough to meet demand. Fridays are busy days so it's better to get an order in earlier rather then later. Send us an email and we will make it happen.

We are probably the leading Bitcoin traders on Silk Road. If you have an account there you can see our vendor page there with nothing but positive feedback. 
Naturally, we are relatively anonymous hence Tormail. Although we are making an effort to do more business on the Clearnet :)
