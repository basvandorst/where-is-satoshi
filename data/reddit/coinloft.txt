Just FYI guys. We haven't charged GST on the Bitcoin value for around 18 months which is when we obtained a private ruling from the ATO.

We run the Australian based bitcoin exchange coinloft.com.au. We wanted to let you guys know that we have started charging 10% GST on all orders as from today. We are very disappointed with the ATO ruling as we feel it is double dipping but at this stage we don't see that we have any option. 
To clarify, this extra 10% goes to the government as tax and in no way increases our profit margin. 
We hope there will be lots of discussion about this ruling in the coming weeks and maybe the ATO will rethink its policy.

We run coinloft.com.au. We are always looking for ways to improve our service and we think we should be able to set up a process to make this happen. Please contact us via our support page and we will try to work something out.

Coin Loft here. Although we can't be too specific we can however confirm that we have received a "Private Ruling" from the ATO regarding charging GST. This effectively means that we are not required to charge GST on the value of Bitcoin purchased only on the commision we charge for the service.

Hi, We run the Australian exchange coinloft.com.au
We take cash deposits at the bank similar to some other exchanges. The best news is that we have obtained a private ruling from the ATO which means we are no longer charging GST on the bitcoin value, just on the commission portion of the order. As far as we are aware we are the only fixed price exchange based in Australia to have achieved this so far.

Just wanted to make sure you guys know  is no longer charging GST on bitcoin value thanks to an ATO private ruling. You can read our blog post and the Bitcoin press.

Yes, like your way of thinking

Hi, as mentioned in a previous reply we have looked at BPay and internet transfers, both could be a possibility in the future. 
We have also discussed having verified Coin Loft users and it is on our road map.

Hi, ok thanks for using Coin Loft anyway. We understand it can sometimes be a hassle to get to the bank. Some of those payment methods you mention are quite un-friendly towards bitcoin. A lot of customers may not realise it but to be honest its a constant battle in this area. That said, we are always looking for ways to evolve our service so we don't rule anything out.
Thanks again. Coin Loft Team

Hi, thanks for taking the time to look at Coin Loft. Yes we do keep a record of phone numbers and email addresses as stated in our privacy policy. The primary reason for doing this is to be able to contact customers if there is a problem with their order or just to send general notifications on the status of their order. We recently added the phone number verification in an attempt to reduce fraudulent transactions.
We have looked at BPay and it could be a possibility in the future. One thing with that though is that it usually takes overnight to be deposited into our account. Currently our service is aimed towards those that want a more immediate bitcoin purchase. Of course we are always thinking of ways to evolve Coin Loft so we are not ruling this out.
Thanks for the heads up on /r/bitcoinaus
