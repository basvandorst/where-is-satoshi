**A few specific altcoins are being paid out regularly** while many BTC or LTC withdrawals sit as pending for weeks. **If you have BTC in cryptsy** you may be better converting to an alt and selling the alt for a loss somewhere else. **If you have alts in cryptsy** you may be better off withdrawing the alt, or converting to an alt that is being paid out, as opposed to trading for BTC and waiting for a withdrawal.

It does not mean "Bitcoin," thats for sure. "Bitcoin Technology" refers to the [blockchain]( technology behind Bitcoin. What is being called "[Bitcoin 2.0]( moves beyond the exchange of currency into a world where records, contracts, and even property can be exchanged online in a decentralized manner.  's response [here]( references [The Mega Master Blockchain List]( which truly explorse the enormous possibilites of this technology.  
Companies like [Blockstream](  [Ethereum]( and [Ind.ie]( are examples of Bitcoin 2.0 projects.

The United States wants to require all small businesses have a license in order to accept Bitcoin. [Regulation]( will continue to drag down the cash value of BTC. Furthermore, a linear prediction indicates the price will continue to fall through 2015. I love bitcoin too, but unfortunately these  markets are easily manipulated. Of course the whales are investing in short positions when "accepting" bitcoin so often means selling it for dollars.

If this site didn't come out of the marketing department at Coinbase, it sure should have. It's great except it sends new users to blindly begin their Bitcoin experience with Coinbase. Not that there is anything wrong with Coinbase. It's just kinda like howtotieyourshoes.com ending with an agreement for Nike to handle your future shoe tying needs.

Welcome to 21st century marketing. In the past companies bought magazine ads, TV commercials and radio spots. Now marketing includes paying for a rolodex of redditors to post and tip on behalf of the company, to upvote and downvote in toe with the company line.  How much discussion regarding changetip and the bitcoin bowl is actually organic? Sending tips is obviously a great marketing tool. The company can simply pay others to hand out free money. What we see as an individual tipping is the new television commercial. Just like many reddit tips weren't paid for by the redditor, shooter jennings isn't giving out free bitcoin, the marketing department at changetip is. The beautiful thing is that when you throw free money around in front of a bunch of peasants they become a clan of dedicated marketers preaching your heavenly word.

Recently when [Reddit welcomed several new team members]( discussed [blockchain technology becoming an integral part of reddit]( Here he references [The Mega Master Blockchain List]( a list of several possible applications of blockchain technology. 
[Decentralization]( is the future of blockchain technology. Agreeably messaging and e-mail are a great place to start.  [Ind.ie]( is currently building a decentralized social network although I don't know that they are using a blockchain. [Bitsquare]( just launched a decentralized bitcoin/fiat exchange application.

This software is really worth taking for a test drive, if only to briefly witness the possibility of Bitcoin 2.0 applications. The [last post]( didn't quite get the momentum it deserved. 
If you have [problems with port forwarding]( open ports 7366 and 7367 on your router and start the software with the following: 
--node.port=7366 --node.useManualPortForwarding=true
To conduct mock trades during the testing period you will need to fund the security deposit from a wallet running on the testnet blockchain.

This is the kind of information we should be giving newbies. Way too often we just blindly send them to any number of companies. Usually a company name that begins with "B" or "C."

This dates back to ancient Israel when the state imposed a year long sabbath every 7 years. Much like the weekly sabbath individuals did not work or plow the fields for an entire year.  Debts were wiped clean. Eventually the people stopped following the ways of the man upstairs. That book whatever you want to call it said that Isreal would pay the price. So the shit went down for 70 years because it was the number of years they failed to do the yearly sabbath. Going to present day. Amercia, like ancient Israel, is founded based on God and Salvation etc. Although there was no agreement to sabbath every 7 years or required religious affiliation like ancient Israel, there was most certainly a foundation based upon Abrahamic principles. These principles suggest that those participating in the systems founded under these beliefs are given a special opportunity every 7 years to cleanse their lives of any dead weight. Be it debts financial or otherwise.  To put things to an end.  An opportunity to rest. 
That being said. Many of the great financial downturns of modern US society have occurred while one of these 7 year cycles has been coming to an end. Often specifically enough to the last day of a specific month of the Hebrew calendar. 
While not denying any natural or spiritual phenomenon it is likely that several of the worlds wealthiest individuals participate in Abrahamic traditions. Their financial actions around theses dates would likely have a domino effect on the markets.

This is a common misconception. Income tax debt is dischargeable when:
    *The due date for filing a tax return is at least three years ago.
    *The tax return was filed at least two years ago.
    *The tax assessment is at least 240 days old.
    *The tax return was not fraudulent.
    *The taxpayer is not guilty of tax evasion.

Not necessarily. To discharge student loan debt one must show that payment of the debt “will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtors dependents.” Section 523(a)(8):


The most common method of determination for eligibility of discharge comes from The Second Circuit in Brunner v New York State Higher Educ. Serv. Corp. In the Brunner decision, the Court held that for a debtor to successfully obtain a discharge of the student loan(s) based upon "undue hardship," that debtor must demonstrate that 


The Tenth Circuit has implemented a modified means of determination such that debtors who truly cannot afford to repay their loans may have their loans discharged and additionally considers whether the debtor is acting in good faith in seeking the discharge, or whether they are intentionally creating the hardship.

Some governments, the US for example, requires a list of purchase and sale information to be submitted with personal income tax returns. 
Use a spreadsheet to track cost basis and purchase dates for all of your lots. Also record sale dates and sale amounts. Also note any commissions or fees paid, be it to or an exchange or to the network. Backup the spreadsheet.

Reddcoin claims to be developing something similar to this. Calling it "Redd-ID" it will allow users to lease an alias or username instead of the traditional long random address. If I remember correctly, the payment for the 1 year alias lease goes to whomever stakes the creation of it.  They've also mentioned Keybase, although I'm not sure if that's what they plan on using, and the potential to send directly to an identity instead of an address or profile. It's been in the works for 6 months but no news yet if they've been successful in getting it function properly.
