Analogy doesn't quite work, since bitcoin cash is faster than bitcoin core, on top of being cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:32:21
true, good point.
bitcoin cash is faster and cheaper by design, but also has low tx volume. zooom

There were lots of spam reviews though... Westley is right.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:02:07
There were a few hardforks in bitcoin's past. They were all attacks?

I figured you might have an issue, because you had kinda committed to laughing off my original post. If you accepted that my post had validity now, you'd feel rather silly.
Anyway, I'll explain (despite how unlikely it is that you'll come around at this point):
It's not the issuance of bonds that gives the government seignorage, it's the issuance of federal reserve deposits that increase the monetary base and reduce the government's need to borrow from the private sector, or impose direct taxes. Wikipedia cites this example explicitly, in the page on seignorage. I recommend reading that first, but if it still doesn't click, you can point out where you think I'm wrong again and I can elaborate.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:06:33
I'll respond, directly and generally :)
No, I'm not referring to minting gold. Yes, I do have a good understanding of how the monetary base is controlled. No I don't believe that the government is making profits by printing $1 bills.
Although I did spell seigniorage wrong, my definition is correct. [Seigniorage is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it.]( Increase in the USD money supply does not primarily occur in $1 notes. Instead, the US [increases the monetary base]( primarily by issuing federal reserve deposits to banks in exchange for US government debt. Monetizing the debt allows the government to run a perpetual deficit, as long as the demand for USD is stable or growing.
I'm sure my answer won't be satisfying to you, because you were focused on an alternate definition of seigniorage (that only includes physical money), but I figured I'd share in case it helped someone understand.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:15:23
What was your rationale for buying? Do you use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:58:51
Oh ok; ignore the second part.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:14:27
Sure, this is done through ["Open Market Operations"](
"Open market operations (OMO) refer to the buying and selling of government securities in the open market in order to expand or contract the amount of money in the banking system"
Basically, the federal reserve buys the US government debt back from the banks that purchased it from the treasury. It's indirectly monetizing the government debt. I'm not sure how much more step by step you want me to get - it's googleable if you need more.
Since you find the wikipedia to be a little obtuse, and lines like "monetary seignorage refers to the sovereign revenue obtained through routine debt monetization, including expanding the money supply" weren't direct enough, maybe other sources will be more helpful.
Here's an article hosted by the St. Louis fed called [**"Seigniorage in the United States: How Much Does the U.S. Government Make from
Money Production?"**](
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:21:11
I'll respond since the other goofballs didn't.
It's when most virtual value (namely money) is stored on blockchains that are difficult for governments to control. When that happens, government loses the ability to collect seniorage (~5% of otuput) and greatly reduces the government's ability to confiscate resources (taxes = ~40% of output).
This major loss of leverage will reduce government spending as a portion of output, and shift the balance of power back to the individual. This will reduce government funded wars, since wars can't be financed as easily by resource confiscation.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:54:19
I think they round down to 0% because the bch fee is so low.
The 1.9% was the fee for that specific transaction, but it sounds like the fee was ~12 cents, and then the % depends on the denominator.
I'm here to learn and I'll be around for a long time. I appreciate any feedback or info you can share. I am trying to learn the truth. I hold bitcoin. I do also hold the minority forks.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:25:34
Well I'm not a shill, so I guess you think I'm stupid. That's alright - I just want to learn and become less stupid.
I think they round the bch fee down to zero, since it's so low. From what I read, the 2% is not fixed; it varies depending on transaction size, so it might be 2% on a small tx but 0.2% on a large one.
Yea, if they are pretending the fees are higher than they are, that would seem unfair. I see where you're coming from on that. However I didn't see that happening. Do you know bitpay's average cost to sweep the transactions vs the fee they charge? Maybe that would help me understand.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:39:29
Agree man. I have really enjoyed using their apps. Copay is the best multisig I have used, I think.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:42:00
Please note that I said a "reduction" in taxation and government spending. You can easily find examples of governments around the world and through history that spend higher or lower % of output, by googling it. Here's a neat article that has some data on which countries spend have spent how much over time: 
Having shared that... I suspect your question may have been rehetorical - you may have been trying to imply "that would be a bad outcome". Although I disagree with you, that wasn't the point of my original post. I only meant to indicate what would happen, not to say whether or not it's a desirable outcome.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:30:56
If the article called "Seigniorage in the United States" doesn't convince you that there's seigniorage in the United States, I'm really not sure what more I can do. If you're genuinely curious, I'll keep discussing, but at least maybe tell me where you see some common ground?
In any case, I have enjoyed the back and forth, so cheers.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:43:40
I think maybe since I responded to this thread you thought I was I was just wondering about Somalia, where you said it works as "free transactions between free individuals". I was wondering why you said that?
I decided to go read a bit more to see what I may be missing, but from anything I have found, Somalia does not appear to be a very free place. Freedomhouse says it is "not free" and rates it 5/100, one of the 10 least free countries on earth, due to constant military violence and insecurity. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:44:23
Ha! Ironic, because he's an ardent pacifist.
No, I don't think we'll wage as much war overall.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:49:35
Yea volume died when the bubble popped.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:44:41
Agreed. Let's just shit on him and tell people that he's a scammer instead of looking for remedies through state violence.
Fortunately, I don't think anyone here is calling for him to be thrown in jail. Mostly, we just want him to be branded a scammer.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:18:01
I know it's not safe, but it's super super easy to use for demonstrating how bitcoin works. (at least before fees have increased a bunch). I wanted to port it to bitcoin cash for demonstration purposes. Do you think that's easily done?
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:15:24
My understanding was that it is used to cover the miner fee required to spend any coins they receive. What are the fees that are required / what did I miss?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:32:52
Thanks I appreciate you saying as much. I can understand the negative sentiment, from people who felt like increasing blocksize was a bad idea. Seems harsh to call someone a scam though just for disagreeing?
I hear the complaint about the fee structure, if it doesn't reflect the underlying cost, but I haven't been able to add up the disconnect. Do you know bitpay's average cost to sweep transactions, vs the rate they charge?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:45:56
Thanks I really appreciate the actual numbers cited. That helps me understand much better. 12 cents doesn't seem particularly excessive; I wonder how they calculate it... could be based on some average over time with &gt;X% confidence to get in the next block.
Is this the main reason that they are accused of being a scam?
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:16:18
I think he may have mistook me for another user, who described an idealized version of society. Unless I accidentally made some implication about a utopia?
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:50:50
I partially agree. However many types of war require significant cooperation and alignment of incentives that just won't happen without the right leverage of centralized institutions.
People are stupid enough to blow each other up for no reason, yes. But they blow each other up even more when they think they can make money doing it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:18:54
All good! The language in the area is definitely not always clear. I study money and I work in financial services and I still often find it confusing.
and for the record you never even called me retard! :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:11:37
Can you point me to a case of lost funds?
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:36:26
Are you saying there are no fees at all for sending bitcoin?
Or maybe you're saying that you think it's unreasonable for bitpay to charge a fee for *receiving* bitcoin, because they don't incur a cost to receive bitcoin (only to send it). Is that right?
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:19:15
well I'm open minded - perhaps you could explain what I'm missing? I don't see where the scam is.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:46:05
LOL. that's great.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:57:03
thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:18:05
I actually have to thank you, because that last article I found was quite interesting. It corrected my estimate (which was way off) with empirical evidence on the amount of seigniorage that the US government collects. The author believes it has ranged from about 1%-3% of real federal on budget spending. Much less than I thought. Very interesting!
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:24:08
Thanks for explaining. What makes you say that there is no military in Somalia? I wasn't able to find good information saying that.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:49:10
The anger comes from both sides being financially and emotionally invested in one of two competing products. Being emotionally invested alone is enough to spark heated debates (e.g. Android vs iOS, PC vs Mac, PS2 vs Xbox, Yankees vs Redsox). Add financial investment on top of that and you have the perfect recipe for angry clashes.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:12:03
I'm not sure I follow. You do think that Somalia is a free place?
My understanding of Hobbes' definition is "the absence of external impediments". Somalia's militaristic violence on civilians seem to go against that, but maybe there's a perspective I'm missing.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:54:26
What's scammy about BitPay? In my experience that have been great. Have made significant contributions to the community.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:08:13
I was asking about Somalia specifically. Does the militaristic violence in the country not affect your thoughts on whether or not it is a free place?
Since they have low taxes - does that make them free, despite having various ruling groups that are violent and coercive to civilians?
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:55:39
Why do you say that there is no government?
The only info I can find seems to say that Somalia has various levels of local and central authority 
Also, are low taxes enough to qualify for freedom / does militaristic violence against civilians matter in your view?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:17:03
Do you mean that there's no coercion in Somalia? Or do you only mean that transactions are free and happen between free individuals?
In either case, I'd be happy to hear about why you say that.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:59:49
I feel the same way. You'll find that many other people picked a side, and adjusted their holdings accordingly.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:44:00
I was really just wondering about the situation in Somalia and why the poster above considered it a free place, or what I had missed.
Whether government is better funded by "everyone" or by "free roaming people", is a whole different can of worms. It you have any valuable opinions though, I'd be glad to hear your answer.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:16:00
Yea, I ended up seeing that. Sounds pretty transparent and fair.
I approached the claims in this thread with an open mind. After listening for a quite a while it seems that the primary reason for the negativity towards bitpay is their support for bitcoin cash. Bitcoin core supporters who see bitcoin cash as a threat want to bring it down by shitting on companies that use it.
I think that's a shame, since the companies are helping bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:36:29
Thanks for sharing that thread - I read through the twitter dialogue that Peter had. I see Peter claim that the charge is "fake" but I don't see why.
My current understanding is that bitpay charges for the cost to sweep the payment. It seems pretty transparent. What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:28:42
thanks, would you be willing to spell out the math for me, since I haven't been able to get it. What's bitpay's average cost to sweep transactions and what do they charge?
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:05:49
wow. I wish they had sent it to my address instead.
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:03:47
It's a competitor and people feel threatened.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:41:17
I'm here in this thread because of my support for bitcoin. I have been holding and using bitcoin for a while now, including purchasing things through bitpay. I was very excited when bitpay first started allowing me to spend bitcoin with several popular merchants (like newegg). I have also used their wallets to store and move my bitcoin.
That's why I'm looking to learn more about why they are being called a scam. From what I have seen, they are a legitimate business. However, I'd be glad to learn about any contrary evidence. Do you have anything to share that could help?
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:52:31
when you save a rushwallet's webpage like this - is that all the code that's necessary to run the site?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:37:46
I'm not sure how we know it's not network fees. From what I read it just covers the cost to sweep the transaction output. Do you have other info? Would be glad to see the numbers.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:18:55
Because it's one of the Bitcoin forks, and a viable threat to the majority fork's dominance. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:02:18

True, 15% now.

What do you mean by "backed by the country's economy"? What does "backed" mean?
