The problem now is that the coins that were cheap and easy to mine have been claimed by the people that need them the least. Those that need them the most, the 6 billion for who bitcoin can actually help, have been locked out of the process of mining and can only purchase coins at a marked up price.

Yes, the problem Bitcoin is facing is what I've coined bitcoin privilege. If Bitcoin is for the other 6 billion, why don't they have easy access or the ability to mine coins? It's a closed old boys club now.

The remaining coins remain not for everyone but for a select group of people who can afford the expensive mining equipment. Mining is no longer for the individual user and this is a sad state of affairs as it means people who need the coins the most don't have access.
Yes, Bitcoin is competition to the banks but we must be careful that the new boss does not become the same as the old boss and this is where bitcoin is headed due to a select few who are privileged.

I am looking for assistance in setting up a think tank to figure out how we can best tackle the problem of bitcoin privilege. Bitcoin was designed for us, the 99% but it's being taken over by the 1%. It won't have a future if we don't tackle these problems quickly.

Expect to meet a lot of resistance when speaking of the privilege the 1% of bitcoiners enjoy. When called on it, they will fight and deny it only to retreat and state it's to your benefit that the few own so many while the masses own next to none.
