That's an excellent resource to point people to who aren't aware of the dangers of implementing cryptography themselves, but his conclusion seems rather dubious and not what I was expecting (emphasis mine):


I was expecting him to emphasize not implementing cryptography yourself, and then pointing to a few known-good implementations. I suppose the better take away would be to assert that one should always assume they are at stage two when it comes to cryptography competence.
Any idea what the author had in mind to replace cryptography?

Nope, I'm in it for the long haul.  Still sitting on all the coins I've mined since I got started a while back.  I value them as a form of currency rather than a commodity to trade, which is inane since I've not been using them as such, but I intend to.  I'm just not smart enough for all this investment crap; that's why I've stayed away from the traditional stock market: "a fool and his money are soon parted", and I know exactly who I am in that addage.
Note: I'm aware of how stupid "a form of currency rather than a commodity to trade" is/sounds; read the rest of the paragraph \^_^

Yup, that's what caught my eye.
What didn't catch my eye was the bid section, or the action section: prompting me to wonder if you were browsing the listing page, mistakingly thought it was a single bitcoin going for $3.75 (below the recent trend), and fired off a quick screen-cap-and-post — "Ebay... for real?"
I certainly wouldn't mind if they went up to $37.50.

Did you apologize to your wife, and explain why you had snapped at her?  Just as importantly, were you able to get to them in time for that $31 peak?  I hope you did, so I can live vicariously through your success — I had none in mtgox at the time, and knew the opportunity would be missed by the time any made it in.

As thorvszeus noted, the physical coins have a private key included in them hidden by a tamper-proof hologram label. If you wanted the coins in your digital bitcoin wallet, you would peel off the hologram and 'scan' the private-key into your wallet. I believe this creates a transaction from the address associated with the physical coin to an address in your digital wallet, or something.
You don't need to do this, however, as they can be used as typical currency: you need only check that the hologram hasn't been tampered with. Synonymous to checking the authenticity security features of modern-day cash.
If you can't quite tell by looking at the hologram, you can look up the address associated with the physical coin within the blockchain to see if the bitcoins have been transferred.
The casascius website, which thorvszeus linked to in his [post]( probably goes into more and better detail.

It certainly does, I wasn't contesting that.  The tar files I was referring to, however, are available on the sourceforge *project* page, which I linked to:


It's hard to tell from the readme quote if the tarballs contain verification node code (which xapped [referred to]( I suspect they don't.
I'm only vaguely familiar with ripple, do you know if the protocol or design is public enough to produce independent verification nodes?

This isn't entirely accurate. As far as I can tell from the Mt. Gox [FAQ]( on [withdrawls and deposits]( this is only true for those who wish to increase the transaction limits.
From the section on "Increasing Transaction Limits":


Other than that, what you've written isn't true. I'm not familiar with this SatoshiDICE thing, though; perhaps you're mentioning this because it deals exclusively in amounts that would necessitate such a limit increase.

I've seen some rather anomalous behavior with the ticker API, I wonder if this could explain it.
Just before going to bed:
    $ date; mtgox
    Thu Apr 18 00:07:59 EDT 2013
    [72.350000, 93.338750, 98.777990]
Earlier today:
    $ mtgox
    [261.000000, 296.546480, 304.400000]
wtf? Let me check that again....
    $ date; mtgox
    Thu Apr 18 09:47:03 EDT 2013
    [261.000000, 296.546480, 304.400000]
    $ date; mtgox
    Thu Apr 18 09:49:11 EDT 2013
    [83.000000, 92.950000, 98.777990]
I noticed this odd, high-value, behavior once before (may have been yesterday, or the day before), but it went away when I cleared out the dot-pyc files. Those files don't exist, so I'm quite puzzled now.
When it happened before, I went straight to their website to see what was being reported: when I saw it was still in the 70s to 90s there I cleared the pyc files.
Has anyone else noticed this behavior?
@_date: 2013-04-20 11:49:20


By reading the shell manual, or experience (one usually follows the other).


In addition to TerribleCProgrammer's [suggestions]( there are a few "round-about" ways you could do so.
After exiting all terminals, you could [shred]( the history file — but this is obviously cumbersome, prone to forgetfulness, and not guaranteed [effective](
You could use the Python interactive interpreter, which doesn't maintain a history between sessions. There are several flaws with this, though: it *does* maintain a history *during* a session, which you would have to find out how and where to secure. Some distributions of Linux will 'help' by installing conveniences perceived to be common along side a package, rather than the plain-default, which may include something like a history file where one wouldn't normally exist (it would be up to the user to realize this).
    Python 3.2.4 (default, Apr 11 2013, 13:02:44) 
    [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from subprocess import call
    &gt;&gt;&gt; phrase = "hunterII plus hunterV equals hunterVII, hunter's revenge!"
    &gt;&gt;&gt; seconds = '30'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; call(['bitcoind', 'walletpassphrase', phrase, seconds])
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
The [bitcoind]( interface is best run as a [daemon]( It provides a [JSON-RPC]( interface to the [API]( which can be accessed locally via the command line interface (exemplified above with the **walletpassphrase** command) and [setup]( for remote access (ideally with SSL).
If setup for remote access, the entrance of the **walletpassphrase** could be handled on a machine that wouldn't introduce the shell-command-history problem. For example, an RPC interface you wrote yourself for your phone.
Due to the similarities between the bitcoin-qt and bitcoind interfaces (and since I've never run the -qt gui),


I was proposing that maybe the -qt interface merely passed off its input to a bitcoind-like interface, and that dr0ne_ was mistaken about the second parameter being a fee — which [some]( seem to have misunderstood.
I doubt that's the case, but a zero being interpreted as "never timeout" would fit with typical semantics.

How does that compare to NotScript, the Chrome variant of FireFox's NoScript? I've recently switched to Chromium from FireFox, and I'm still trying to figure out the best plugin parallels.
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:44:43


I use the satoshi client as well, but only in daemon mode (on Linux). I have never used the qt interface, but the process for the daemon to unlock your wallet is:
    $ bitcoind walletpassphrase &lt;passphrase&gt; &lt;timeout&gt;
Perhaps you are mistaken about "password + fee", and accidentally set a very long timeout. Worst case scenario, the behavior for a timeout of 0 (i.e., thinking "zero fee") would be "never timeout", but I haven't checked the source to see if that's what it would do.
@_date: 2013-01-25 03:23:25


Nope, it is a reflection of the current processing power: it is intended to ensure the creation of blocks is consistent over time (six every ten minutes, or something, I don't quite recall).


I'm keeping my GPU system, but not for mining ("Application-Specific Integrated Circuit" [ASIC] is the new mining hardware). I built the rig with "General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Hardware" ([GPGPU]( in mind: I'm an aspiring independent inventor, and am able to use massively parallel programming techniques to model experiments that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive to explore. When I learned about bitcoins, I was lamenting my inability to build a system for that purpose due to costs — my setup isn't significant by any means, but it was fully paid for thanks to bitcoins (more than enough to learn the methods before expanding further). RMA's screwed me over a bit, had to give up a 5870 for a 7850.
If you'd like to know the details of bitcoin, you should read the [white paper]( (PDF). It is a nine-page technical explanation of the system. If you're worried about it being too technical, think of it as something to work towards: understanding the paper.

But it's inconsistently producing shit results....
Two files:
    $ cat bitcoin/loadurl.py
    
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    from json import loads
    def loadurl(url):
            data = urlopen(url)
            sdata = data.read().decode('utf-8')
            jdata = loads(sdata)
            data.close()
            return jdata
    if __name__ == '__main__':
            import sys
            print(loadurl(sys.argv[1]))
    $ cat bitcoin/mtgox.py
    
    from loadurl import loadurl
    def mtgoxAPI():
            return loadurl("
    if __name__ == '__main__':
            ticker = mtgoxAPI()["ticker"]
            print("[{:.8f}, {:.8f}, {:.8f}]".format(ticker['low'],ticker['last'],ticker['high']))
Note: I just updated the print line to be more "pythonic", which also corrected the number of decimal places (the values above only had six).
If you have the "satoshi client" installed and running as a daemon, then from the command line you can issue:
    $ python -c "print [$(bitcoind getbalance) * p for p in $(mtgox)]"
And it will give your value for the low, last, and high. So, if I had 10 BTC:
    $ mtgox
    [83.00000000, 97.00000000, 97.00000000]
    python -c "print [$(bitcoind getbalance) * p for p in $(mtgox)]"
    [830.0, 970.0, 970.0]
**Edit**: if you don't have Python3 installed (and why not? Hmmm?) let me know, and I'll see if I can dig out a 2.7 version.
**Edit2**: if you *only* have Python3 installed, then the command line python incantation to see the value of your bitcoind balance across the low, last, and high reported by the Mt. Gox ticker should be:
    $ python -c "print([$(bitcoind getbalance) * p for p in $(mtgox)])"
or, on my system (since I have 2.7 and 3.2):
    $ python3 -c "print([$(bitcoind getbalance) * p for p in $(mtgox)])"

This is self-correcting. As the processing power decreases (number of people willing to run miners) the difficulty will decrease as well, thereby making it easier for people to mine again.
I recently had to turn off my (GPU) rigs because the cost of electricity was not being matched by the price of BTC:USD. If I remember correctly, their price would have to climb up to something like $39 for me to merely break even.
If the difficulty were to drop: my rigs could achieve more for the same amount of electricity usage, and the break-even price would be lower as a result.
