What has he coded lately?
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:33:54
The Dunning-Kruger effect is *so strong* with this guy.
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:12:42
What gains? You still have only bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:48:59


The essence of reddit.
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:04:10
He says bitcoin is a good example of something that hasn't seen widespread adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:29:13
That would be nice but it would wipe out all crypto profits.
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:08:32
It depends entirely on how you ended up with that net profit. If you traded for huge gains in 2017 and lost everything in 2018 for a net gain of $100 you're fucked unless you already paid the taxes on your 2017 profits.
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:59:42


I guess all the reports about Overstock accepting bitcoin were false after all.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:38:31
Yes. A gain is a gain, there are no easy loopholes
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:16:33
It is a pyramid scheme though, that's just being honest. I think this space needs a bit more honesty.

Uninstall it, then install Firefox.

Bitcoin obsession seems to strongly correlate with mental illness.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:35:56
You're not normal.
@_date: 2019-11-03 10:51:41
That's not how it works. The middlemen who transmit the messages charge the fees, not the recipient.
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:25:24
They are. They are buying actualmoney with it. That's why the price is going down.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:02:27
There's nothing to understand. Bitcoin price only depends on the madness of the crowds.
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:01:07
You don't have an ID but you have a lawyer?

It's also the third Chinese New Year this year.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:12:57
Yeah, how will you ever offload your bags without buyers?
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:47:24
It won't remain equal.
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:23:51
Most people who have bought bitcoins are regretting it too, or are about to.
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:20:29
It's not like being a redditor is something to be proud about.
@_date: 2019-11-03 10:49:29


No problem, all bitcoin technology is based on this basic principle
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:45:33
This is sure to work in your favor.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:19:33
You mean it will, in 18 months?
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:18:47
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:04:48
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:15:59
It's not a shock since everyone knows it's coming. It's priced in.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:58:56
They won't be selling any at that price. In order to pay for their running expenses and make at least some profit they will have to drop the price and cut costs by shutting off their oldest and least efficient ASICs.
@_date: 2019-11-03 10:52:25
Not you, the middlemen.
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:48:55
Luckily stocks, real estate and many forms of tangible possessions have been invented.
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:06:22
It has always been like that.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:45:57
Lol, he told you in simple terms how your greed is being exploited by market manipulators, and you outright rejected the explanation because it does not fit your worldview
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:01:35


They don't.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:43:54
\- because the average person understands that it's a pyramid scheme and therefore completely unsustainable
@_date: 2019-08-22 08:54:13
They're both annoying. If they accepted bitcoins they undoubtedly would have plastered their door with "bitcoin accepted here!!!" stickers, since the only businesses accepting bitcoin are those run by bitcoin fanatics.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:13:44


You really haven't thought this through.
@_date: 2019-08-22 08:57:37


Do you think the regulation just goes away if you use bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:56:32
There isn't any. American "libertarians" vote conservative 100% of the time, which makes them conservatives.
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:02:16
Bitcoin isn't an industry, it does not produce anything except scams.
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:40:00


@_date: 2019-10-23 09:58:00
It means participating in money laundering.
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:18:27
Instead the old guy would have been stabbed in a darkened parking lot or lost all his butts to a scammer, that's much better.
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:38:10
Sounds pretty illegal to me, report them to 
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:56:48


@_date: 2019-06-28 09:31:12
Without greater fools this just doesn't work.
@_date: 2019-12-01 00:21:23
The moon is made of green cheese.
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:11:47
Cool, another middleman!
@_date: 2019-12-25 07:31:51
Actually true bitcoiners love the drug trade and money laundering, you must be a statist plant.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:44:11


Yes it is.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:46:48
OK butter
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:56:20
All bitcoins are the same.
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:41:06
Please realize that this line of thought is just sad and will get you nowhere. To improve your life you have to change. You. The problem is you, not other people.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:21:52
Yes they are. Most of them anyway.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:58:51
Capitalists? White people? Men?
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:04:52
Quick, make up some new lies, the rubes are getting wise to the old ones.
@_date: 2019-12-01 00:21:07
Bitcoiners are smart.
@_date: 2019-12-28 10:36:48


A fiction?
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:47:53
@_date: 2019-12-28 10:32:36
Wow, bitcoin can do the same thing as 1000+ other cryptocurrencies!
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:05:49
OK butter
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:16:33
18 months.
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:11:18
Only losing 30% of your bitcoins is a better deal than most in the field of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:20:01
@_date: 2019-12-12 06:01:34
Set the money on fire in the backyard, then pretend you have some bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:57:11
Double cringe.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:55:15
Finally, an easy way to recognise people with bad money management skills.
@_date: 2019-12-31 11:10:21
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:15:04
If you're smart you'll just use a bank.
@_date: 2019-12-25 07:50:03
Lmao, bitcoiners never disappoint
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:13:05


Lol you literally believe in magic
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:34:02
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:44:37
Are you familiar with the concept of dividend?
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:15:04


They encourage the stupidity because bitcoin cannot survive without a constant stream of bagholders entering the game. This way the pyramid will keep going for a while longer and they can maybe make a few more bucks out of it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:38:30
The hodlers already were affected when they bought in at ridiculously inflated prices. Their actualmoney is already sitting in some whale's wallet and it's not coming back.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:37:21
Yeah, you bought bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:25:59
UK banking *proved* its security by returning the £200 to the victim it was stolen from. Your mistake was to use bitcoin. It'll be very hard for you to convince them that you are not also the other party of the transaction, selling bitcoins to yourself to launder the stolen GBP.
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:21:29
It's always someone else's fault. Bitcoin cannot fail, only be failed.
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:32:47
What do you think?
