This is true, and it may be addressed in a future version of bitcoin.  The fee could be the responsibility of the recipient.

Cool, thanks for the reply.

If it is encrypted does it really need to be stored offline? Why not drop it in your email or Google drive or something?

The thing is that these new users represent the general public.  While serious bitcoin enthusiasts know all the backstory, theory and politics, the wider public does not, and you can't really expect them to.
Do you expect the average mum and dad to set up cold storage for their bitcoin?  Make geographically redundant backups?  Make informed choices on how much encryption is appropriate for their wallets?  Even understand the difference between a wallet and an address?  What about when to create a new address or when to reuse an old one?
I don't know about you, but when I sit down with my friends and relatives of non technical background, AES256 rarely comes up in dinner conversation.
The thing is though, they don't have to know all the background.  To me, the important thing about bitcoin is not that you have to store and manage all your bitcoin yourself, it's that you *can*.
Bitcoin is like cash, it has all the advantages of cash that we all know and love: *you* control it, and most importantly, *you* can transfer it to another person without permission from a third party.  If you want, you can store all your money in cash, and bury it in your backyard or put it in a safe.  Some people do, but guess what?  Most people don't.  They put it in the bank^1.
This is what needs to happen with bitcoin.
Financial institutions with good credit ratings need to provide bitcoin storage just like a bank does for cash.  When getting into bitcoin is as easy as opening a new bank account, *then* the average person might do it.  It doesn't mean that people like the regulars on this forum will need to use such a service (although I expect many of them would).  The beauty of bitcoin is that you *can* manage it yourself if you want, not that you must.
I am happy for my bank to handle most of my transactions (I usually pay by card).  But if I want to do something without their involvement, I simply withdraw some cash.  Doing this online however has been impossible until now, with bitcoin, and that's what bitcoin really offers.  The freedom of cash online.
I think the bitcoin community can learn from the Linux community.  How many times have people proclaimed that "*this year* will be the year of desktop Linux!"  I've even heard people say the exact same thing about bitcoin, which just makes me laugh.
You don't see your average joe configuring his Arch box, this is something reserved for Linux geeks.  What you do see is your average joe on an Android phone, because someone has finally made a product that is accessible to non technical people.
^1 When I say bank, this is from an Australian perspective.  It sounds like banks have a lot worse reputation in the US than here, and if I'm not mistaken, people often use credit unions.  Feel free to replace 'bank' with 'credit union' in the above.

This is true, but to be fair it is also true of PayPal.  You need a credit card (or similar) to use PayPal, and to get that you need to submit ID to someone.
There is simply no way to interact with a financial institution without giving them your ID.  So the options are to get your bitcoin from someone you are willing to supply ID to, or get them from a private trade, accepting whatever risks may be involved from whichever option you choose.

Whoa hold on, I knew I could convert USD into bitcoins, but I can convert people too?!

As I understand it Butter coin is supposed to be an actual exchange, whereas Coinjar simply buys and sells bitcoin from their customers at a spot price.

Seriously though, do it by upvoting a post not duplicating it...
Best to be informative without being obnoxious.

Me too, last purchase I made it took about 15 minutes for the first confirmation to occur.  I'm not sure why that was, but it was a pain sitting around and waiting for it.
Could it be related to the android app lowering the miner fee recently perhaps?

Just to clarify, although it is called a 51% attack, is not more accurate to say the attacker would need the majority of the processing power, not specifically 51%?
That is to say, wouldn't 50.000001% be adequate?  In which case GHash.IO likely passed this already in recent days.

Setting my watch to 2 weeks for when the CEO runs away with all the bitcoin.

Thank you for this, I *just* finished downloading the previous one!

Except this one:

And the year of desktop Linux!

I am concerned with privacy for the same reason anyone is.
Let's assume I paid for everything in Bitcoin, and didn't do any mixing.  Everyone I buy something from can see everyone else I pay money to.  I pay some pocket money to my kids, then they can see what stores I buy gifts for my partner from.  I donate to a local charity and they can see what medical specialists I have been visiting.  My employer pays my salary and they can see what political parties I donate to.  There's a million examples of why I (or anyone else) wants privacy.
For me, this is not a feature, but a problem.
If it is designed to be that way, then so be it (although mixing would then have to be considered a way to work around a feature of Bitcoin).

Thanks for the info.  I'll have to look up private addresses because I'm not familiar with them.  How do you normally go about doing this? (What software?).  Does it still maintain privacy when you transfer it to your spending account?
**edit**:  What app do you suggest?  I am using Bitcoint Wallet.  It's possible that it has this feature, but I just am not aware of it.  How do you address the issue of people you pay money to seeing where else you spend your money?
