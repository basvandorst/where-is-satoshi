Please consider saving a nice big chunk (50%) as I'm fairly sure we're going to see an additional 10x then 100x growth in the price of BTC in our lifetimes. That's the next 20-30 years. It seems like each 10x of growth is happening every doubling of time. 
By cashing out now I feel you're denying future charities of additional funds.

No, but the waitress is the one that has to operate it from day to day. 
As for my impression of immigrant waitresses I'm just relaying my single experience at a restaurant. Here is my sad story: 
Ostensibly the place took bitcoin, there were stickers on the hostess podium and a sticker on the front door. But after I ate, and with halting english the waitress said they no longer took bitcoin. Her motivation was opaque. I couldn't tell if she said the owner said no more or she didn't want to go through the rigamarole of getting the bit-pay app up and running. Because, last time I was there a younger waitress had to help her setup the payment on an ipad, neither which were there when I went a second time. Also, I called ahead (an hour before I arrived) and asked if they still took Bitcoin and they had said "Yes." 
So, yes, overall a simpler payment system is good, regardless of the context. 
I wonder if anyone is trying to work with current POS operators to get bitcoin working on their terminals. I think that's the future there.

You do know that 'Fight Club' is satire, right?

What it seems to me to come down to is privilege, the wealth of ease. If everyone got a private tutor for every subject, if everyone were born into families that wanted them... Even more basically if we all had stable households and nutritious food and clean water... Sure we'd still have a-holes and the lazy, but far far less.

It is a new kind of money that anyone can send using a computer. With it you can quickly send money to anyone else in the world. What makes it different is that you do not have to trust anyone to use it. No person can stop you from using it. If you use it right, no person can take your money from you.
It is a way for people who don't have to trust each other to agree on how much money everyone has. People only have to trust that most people are good. People use their computers to find answers to hard problems to show everyone that they did work. They get money for the work they did.
It is a shared group of how much money each person has. Every person who uses this stuff agrees with each other every 10 minutes, using computers. It can't be broken in to or changed by anyone. No new money can be added by anyone. 
You can send any small part of money for things that you could not before over the computer. I could send you money using your phone without using the normal money holding people, just straight from you to me.

There's a world of difference between a random set of 256 bits with only Platonic reality and a soup of molecules in a hot stew. Those bits "live" only in one disconnected moment across all reality, they have no neighbors, they have no history, they have no future. Those atoms are shuffled and swapped in furious action, and innovation of information only has to happen once in all those countless bumping and shuffling around for it to stick.

You're asking for a lecture I don't have the time or inclination to give you. I do however admire your honey badger like tenacity after my rude GIFs. 
So, I will allow you to rent my time to hold your hand through all the disciplines you're drawing from. Think of it as aimed tutoring. 
For my time simply deposit 300 mBTC (0.3 BTC) here: 18u5bDYAbKTYFepv5GgtbnzNeXMdWHMqdH 
(1/2 now and 1/2 upon completition)
And I will break down your questions into digestible chunks, sort out your knowledge from your ignorance, and get you on the bus with everyone else. We can schedule the tutoring after you make the first deposit of 50% of the funds. 
**Or for all the love that is holy, leave me alone and go find out this shit yourself.**

Catch 22's just need bootstrapping. They just need the minimum amount of inertia to get the whole system moving. Its the same in computer programming. As soon as we can move from machine code to assembly there is an exponential rise in the complexity/time ratio possible.

Are you familiar with the way bitcoin.info sets up your wallet? It's all local. They have no control. If that's third party then go ahead and use dice to find your address and roll your QR code with graph paper, lol. 
No, I meant "3rd party payment processor". Someone that converts BTC to fiat and back and forth. Sorry if I was unclear. 
Truth is if we use bitaddress or bitcoind we're still trusting other people's code. For the ultra-paranoid we need to hand code address generators. Right?

It doesn't seem like you understand the power of evolution and the scale of times being discussed. That's okay, they're both non-intuitive. 
You got some serious homework to do though. I don't have time for all the answers to all your questions, but books and magazines and recorded lectures do. 
Are you on Khan Academe or any of those other education sites? Go there and drink from the academic fire hose. Heck, I'm sure a perfunctory search on youtube will help you out. 
You may also want to think on the "bootstrapping" moment for each step, about what is maximally conserved, and the sheer messiness of biology.

That's an *argument from authority.* 
And a grievous logical fallacy. Just because some Mr. Smarty pants says something is true or not true does not make it so. Also, being a philosopher does not make one an expert in DNA (that's geneticists), evolutionary theory (an evolutionary biologist), or the existence of one or many deities (unknowable). Being a philosopher makes you an expert in talking about epistemology.

Do you know what a Turing Machine is? Are you familiar with Universal Computing? Rule 124?
It's the most basic abstraction of a computer, of computing its self. It's the heart of intelligent action. Does this look familiar at all? Do you see the digital nature of DNA in here? Can you count all the pieces?
Are you familar with Cellular Automaton? Of super simple rules creating highly complex objects through the act of simply iterating the rules again in the system. 
As far as I can tell Life is inevitable in any complex enough system with enough iteration. Its fractals all the way down, man. 
But sadly I'm going to have to leave you to your own learning. I have no more enthusiasm for relaying my own discoveries about the nature of reality. I did the hard work, and so should you. Never rest! 
My most enthusiastic and generous estimate it will take you maybe 8-12 hours to finally reach an "ah-ha". You could get it in a day. Or you may never get it. I don't care.

Just make a wallet at  or use their app. Print up the QR code and watch it with your phone, tablet, laptop, or whatever computer. 
Now, keeping tabs for tax purposes might be a little tricky, but I'm sure it's no more difficult than having a pad of paper near the register. People buying booze with Bitcoin aren't going to be 100+ a day. They might get one a week, and that's optimistic. Which is why there should be a 5-10% discount for buying with bitcoin, I think.

Wel... kinda... 
Don't forget Bitcoins can be divided down to the Sitoshi. So that means you can do a billion "dollars" worth of unique non-repeting single token transactions (more or less), I think, with one bitcent. 
Also, don't forget that the bitcoin token is just half of the equation. The other (and I feel bigger) part of Bitcoin is the transactional network. **People don't need to own or speculate with bitcoins to use them.** They can use them at point of sale. Right? Personally I think that's the strongest part of Bitcoin, that's why I support the value of the token by holding some. And hopefully other people will value the network enough to make the tokens more scarce so that the ones I control will be worth more. 
I don't know about wealth and freedom being contradictory. That's a whole nuther ball o wax.

Short story: I have an relative that does applications to a large and prestigious school. Mostly what she balances is "How dumb is this applicant?" and "How much money can they bring to the school?"
So, from a completely rational and selfish point of view I would say: Find the one that has the most ability to help grow the Bitcoin network in all ways: socially, computationally, and philosophically.

I'm not saying they're going to freeze **your** account **right now**. 
***But they reserve the right to do that at anytime for any reason.*** Just as Kickstarter reserves the right to halt funding. Just as any restaurant reserves the right to kick any customer out. 
Paypal has done it before and they'll do it again. Here's a completely shitty website that's a small glimpse into it. 
All things being equal **you** will probably have a pain free experience with paypal for the rest of your life as will most of their customers. That doesn't mean the chances of them exercising their control is 0%. Just at the chance of Bitcoin failing isn't 0%. Not that I'm saying they're the same magnitude of not-zero, but still...  
With *any* crypto-currency your "token of value" is your token. No one else can freeze you out of it... unless the network goes away or someone steals your passwords. But I'm sure you know that already.

Your sarcasm and derision is well timed and well deserved. I splurted out a childish harangue and you called me on it. Let me show you that I'm not just a complete little bitch, for whatever it's worth. 
These are the facts. 1) I was not able to easily run Armory on either of my two computers, each with different operating systems. 2) I talked to a savvy Bitcoiner and they shared their opinion that Armory wasn't user friendly enough. 
I loved the idea of Armory, its functions make me happy feeling in the warm place. I want want want what it has, but it won't give it to me. I want it so bad, and it won't give it to me. The other 3 bitcoin clients that I tried worked just fine and delivered on their promises. Armory didn't. Armory failed me. 
Maybe it'll be the bee's knees in the future, more competition is good competition, but I'm not backing Armory now.

And finally mutual attraction is probably one of the most clear cut of human behaviors in the mating repertoire next to the act of mating and its consequences.

It seems to me that the argument of "If society fails bitcoin will fail." Is a bit like "Why build your house out of bricks? If the earth opens up it will swallow all the houses whether they're made of straw or brick." Well, brick houses are fireproof, don't have to be rethatched, and are easier and faster to build. Maybe one day all the houses will be made with brick. Maybe something better than brick will come along.

I think there's a part of your story missing. How could you send the BTC to an address by mistake? You didn't type it in by hand, did you? It's very unlikely that you would get a valid address by mistake. 
If you want to send a message to the account you can send a very small amount of BTC with a note on it asking for your money back. But don't count on it.

The ATM says 1%, but I bought some the other day at $371CAD/1BTC and that seemed 5-7% over market price when I got it (according to a quote from MtGox)... but that price has proven to be just fine and dandy for my means (goin' long). 
The longer I think about it, the better that ATM looks. It's got a $3K limit so I **have** to dollar-cost-average over time, and that just the safest way.

Clear it with management first...
Print out individual business cards with a QR code on one side and the words in fancy italics "If you appreciated your service today please consider tipping..." Or more personal. "Hi, my name is Pilly Wild, it was pleasure to serve you today. If you would consider tipping..." 
Or you could have a little placard at the main desk with a big QR code on it that's a pool for the whole help. Then that gets split up at the end of the month or something. Also it could serve as a conversation/distraction for harried customers. 
I can see it in my mind right now. 5"x6" plastic L card with "Bitcoin accepted" underneath and a pile of brochures in the back explaining bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't have a "main idea". It's a network of ideas working in concert. Paper wallets are a strategy to solve certain problems transferring ownership of the bitcoin tokens. 
Now I do easily agree that printing out a paper block chain would be ridiculous, maybe putting a public/private key pair on a real world object as a gifting or storage means is appropriate in some instance. I think so.

No, I'm trying to say that if one's philosophical concern is the ***absolute*** control of their funds, as opposed to having to trust someone else, they might want to consider investing their value into a cryptocurrency. 
For the business owner they don't even have to touch a single Sitoshi. The blokes that do the heavy lifting are services like CoinBase and Bitpay. Sure the payment is "floating" in Bitcoin for a moment, but for all intents and purposes the price is transparent to business owners that use these services. All the benefit of lower fees and instant payment, none of the shite. And even if Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin disappear tomorrow they've lost nothing. 
*Just a reminder...* There's two different things called "Bitcoin". The network that supplies the transaction platform and the only token available on that platform. *Speculators and wankers go on about the price of the token...* **Business owners go straight for the good stuff and use the network to their advantage.**

*not exactly what OP asked for...* But using  I tried to boil it down, as I understand it... 
It is a new kind of money. It is a money that to have it you need your own big number that points to your money.
This money is made by many computers doing very hard problems. These problems get harder over time until no more money can be made.
To pay for something you give someone a number. That number goes on a big set of numbers that everyone can look at. That numbered box also points back to where that money came from before you had it. And then back to when the money was made.
For each person that has this money it can buy more stuff. That is good for everyone.
The bad parts are that if you lose your own box number no one can find it for you, it is gone. Also once you give someone your money you can not take it back. And if someone has your own number they can move your money away.

Looking at the curve for the price of bitcoin I'm reminded of the process of starting a beligerant engine, say a small one or two stroke engine.

Hopefully nothing as that functionality would be part and parcel of its consciousness. Just as neurons don't need to worry about their health if the brain they're in becomes conscious because that consciousness would require the neurons to work *exactly* as they had been working before.

thankfully I remembered to look at which subreddit I'm posting to this time. In I totally wouldn't have said that. 
Yes, Bitcoin beertap. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:42:49
True. Good to know. 
Why make a new reddit user account just to say that? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:00:54
Because that introduces a third party which makes the system less secure.

I agree with the commenter: 
*Trust no one for big amounts!
Just make your own full wllet , buy a Desent PC install Linux and Run a full wallet with full blockchain like bitcoin-qt , install your lunux with standard encryption , and incrypt and store your wallet in a encrypted file!
Only opensource encryption! , so better get tech shavie or miss the boat :)*

Use props! Bring up three other students. Have one be the blockchain, then two having a transaction. One piece of secret paper has Alice's private key on it. One piece has Bob's public key. They exchange fiat/goods/services and the transaction goes on the block chain. 
Or something like that...

...as an aside...
I recently explained the Bitcoin protocol to my decidedly nontechie partner. And after a Day or two they got it. I'm not saying it's easy, and they have to try, but eventually everyday normal people, I think, can get it. Or at least that's what I'm telling myself.

Deflation. In anything but an account with over the inflation rate Joe is losing money just because the Federal Reserve is making more bills willy nilly. There can only be less than 21mill Bitcoins. 
If anything Joe should use it as an additional savings account. And a good brain refresher to understand the basic security protocols.

Feel free to add your personal information to every one of your bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:29:36
Ahhh, I don't think you quite get the nature of bitcoin then. You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can get a 1/10 or 1/100th of one. A Sitoshi (1/1,000,000th of a bitcoin). 
And Bitcoin is actually scarce as most fiat is printed whenever the people that own the presses want more of it in circulation. There will ever only be 21,000,000 bitcoins. In mathematical fact that would be more like 20,999,999.9999... and that's not taking into account all the bitcoins that are lost forever. 
No, friend, you can buy $1 worth of bitcoin, if that's all you can spare. I would suggest at least 0.1 BTC though.

I feel yah. I have an affluent part of my family and they're not very curious. I brought up Bitcoin recently and no one wanted to learn about it, they thought they knew everything already. I dropped it as much as I could, but I was super into it and thought they would **like to understand something that jazzes me up**. Oh well. 
All things being equal I think most people hang on to their view point of the world with white knuckles. As if changing their minds or learning something new will mean that they've been cheating or that they're assholes or that Satan won or it'll make baby Jesus cry. 
Thing is, we need those people to adopt Bitcoin. Or at least be cool with it.
