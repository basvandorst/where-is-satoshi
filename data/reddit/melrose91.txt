That is consistent with my conspiracy theory.

Indeed, BTC in popular in Argentina too. I'm Venezuelan.

OMG, I can't stop laughing.

I have seen some restaurants accepting ETH, LTC, and Dash besides BTC. It's true that if we ever need fiat money for anything, Bitcoins are easier to exchange, LocalBitcoins is very active in this country. However, you have to be careful of the amounts, the government is monitoring big money movements (that they are not actually big, they are just big for the average Venezuelan). Imagine if I wanted to spend $300 in Bolivars, if I exchanged them, the bank would probably block my account unless I had a registered business and a business account.  
That's the reason why you'll find some restrictions for negotiation. Some people in LBC prefers not selling or buying BTC from a natural person, they prefer a legal person.

That's not true, we know what's going on with this crappy government and we understand crypto. You have no idea how many seminars, courses and stuff going on here about cryptocurrency, there are big discussions with economists about it.

It's because the government monitors bank accounts closely and the sellers could get into trouble if they transfer "big amounts" to a natural person. It's not a LBC thing, it's more about how problematic the government is here.
Also, if a natural person receives big amounts, the account can be blocked.

Don't believe anything of what I'm going to say, it's just a conspiracy theory of mine. I see next year a major economic crisis, and that crisis will extend because it will affect highly leveraged markets (FOREX and commodities will react to Brexit and it won't stop) What if bigger players are manipulating the market just to enter really cheap and cover their asses on BTC when the crisis starts in 2019. This probably makes no sense, or maybe it does....

I saw the Facebook markets in my city today and the amount of GPU's is insane.

Where I live, we have 2 blackouts of 6 hours each. They are pretty much on a schedule, but sometimes they just go random.

Bitcoin is actually more liquid than USD. Many freelancers like them better and they exchange the USD they earn for BTC. It's easier to find someone accepting BTC, ETH or even Dash than to find someone accepting PayPal.
