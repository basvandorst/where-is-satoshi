I remember reading your post... I've had no involvement with Bitfinex whatsoever but it's a shame many people decided to shrug it off... 
To me it just smells like an inside job... 
@_date: 2016-08-26 11:49:11
Yes! 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:27:59
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:59:25
That's very sad to hear... I also tried to go to a place in Brighton that accepted Bitcoin and they had no idea... 
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:54:09
Thanks :) I just don't want to be a preacher... I'd wish for someone to just sit down one day and ask me "So.. this Bitcoin, how does it work?" 
Anyways, like you said! Keep it steady, and we will all get there together! :)

Lee, I did this for a while and one way or another, if what you offer has a good price and your end-product is good.  Word of mouth will be sufficient to keep you going. Best of luck!

I like the mentality, that's why this community is great! Thanks

I think he means you won't sell because most Greek people don't know what Bitcoin is... 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:31:02
I like this idea, it's not like we can all be wearing bitcoin merchandising all day though such as caps, tshirts so something subtle like this would be great.
Unless we want to print a big flag of Bitcoin and carry it everywhere, it's also an option ! :P 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:04:35
It's weird... because I have on the other hand met people online who live in other places of Spain and they too haven't met personally people who use Bitcoin until they go to a meet up. 
I think at this point we are just scattered around the world and it's going to take some time for the "interest" to be similiar amongst people from the same town, city,etc.. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:00:31
I live in Spain and I don't know anyone that uses Bitcoin except for some friends who live in London. 
There are great people trying hard to spread the word in Spain and meet ups are great but when it comes to the streets... not many people know about bitcoin..

This is highly appreciate, thanks a lot.

I too used Transferwise when I lived in the UK (Im spanish). It's a great system and they have a decent customer service if you encounter any trouble. Best of luck at uni , i had some of the best years of my life whilst I studied at uni there. enjoy. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:58:49
Also, [Bitcoin.de]( are great and most users are German so I don't understand why it's so hard for you ? Good luck. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:39:21
This only proves how much work still has to be done, It's going to be a long process. Some of us will act as teachers, some as normal users and others will just see BTC as an investing tool. 
Just remember to avoid being a Bitcoin preacher, don't force people to use it, it's not for everybody, but do correct people when they are trying to paint it negatively or are misinformed. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:35:52
i love to find other fellows on the bitcoin one, we're all going to build a bright future.

You have calmed my mind. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:34:16
A very easy way and which I am doing now is with the [Blockchain Merchant]( app.
All you need to do is put your address and you're good to go! If you want your BTC to go directly to cash you can try other services such as [BIPS.]( 
and if you want an actual POS, have a look here.

Sounds great!I'll have to check it out. I've just had bad experiences with CEX.io before and it's a risky risky area for me now. Bitcoin is going to drive us all crazy but eventually make us so happy!

It is possible that this guy was just doing this for fun, reading some of his comments I had a chuckle or two xD

Two days ago I purchased bitcoins with my Mastercard (Spain).  Does that mean, I can't do it anymore? 
@_date: 2014-08-27 08:58:03
That's true, now days it's hard to decide take decisions with digital products like this. We just get lied to constantly, I'm going to hate the day when we're all unable to keep our privacy.

I've been using it, just a bit tired of them charging me even if i use SEPA transfer they still charge me 5€ :( 
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:38:26
In Spain we never seem to get things right. I've just opened a business, it has 0 competition around the area. Yet people STILL want lower prices and ask for things you can't even imagine... (it's an innovative gift shop).
And YES i accept bitcoins hehe. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:52:57
So this time it was YOU who bought before it started to decline... not me! :P  Welcome to the world of Bitcoin my friend, wish you all the best. It's awesome.

They offer the whole pack of web building really, domains, site builder, some basic SEO to have your tags and headers right.
They have higher prices than what it would normally cost you, but you get to do it all from one place. I used to make websites using Wix but the loading times sometimes were too slow. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:03:31

I never knew that a kid like me
Could take his phone around the world and pay in B-T-C
And rock the masses, from Madrid to Calabassas
Tijuana, Mexico, Bitcoins in Tokyo
They know me though, 'cause I be puttin' in work
Commit my life to crypto's, 'cause that's my word
I'm sure you heard, about a new currency going around
It's spreading all over the world, but i still can't use it in my town
We rep. the internet, so what you talking about
I'm not running off my mouth, I know this without a doubt
'Cause if you know these bits, then these bits know you
When it's time to handle business, then you know what to do
Me and my crew, we stay true, to hold or use
Many feel lost, but the chosen knew
Bitcoins rise to the top, what you want? Just in case you forgot
Rush the exchange, deposit cash, show me what you got
MOON! here comes the MOON!
Ready or not, I got my bitcoins now!
MOON! here comes the MOON!
Ready or not, I got my bitcoins now!
Is that all you got?

My friends father actually has a QR code on his back that takes him to a website about him. It's pretty bizarre.
Aside from the safety issues it's just not a great idea just yet maybe seeing as Bitcoin right now isn't stable - I am a complete Bitcoin supporter but as a Tattoo is for life(kind of with laser and al),but think about it and the smartest place you'd pick for it, incase it all happens

I have Santander SEPA transfers and yet it still charges me. It's very weird indeed.. I've emailed them like I said with screenshots of their platform taking a 5€ cut each time i deposit but nothing. I've lost like 40€ on fees there -.-.. Just tired of losing money without reason tu sabe.. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:56:00
I remember at the start it would take 2-3 hours to process.. Maybe you had even faster processes but it was indeed beautiful. I'm glad they did well though, I still don't judge them for the fees it may be my fault or my bank..but i'm just looking for a faster way to buy small amounts now and then. :) 
Thanks

@_date: 2015-05-05 13:36:12
It's probably true though... expect a future with big brands endorsing bitcoin. Get your new Nike that mine BTC as you run and why not buy your new RayBans with a btc wallet included: Just look and pay with bitcoin!

I had a 400€ deduction on my PayPal account to someone I never heard of.. and after several complaints I got a call from a lady from PayPal in Ireland offices to literally accuse me of lying and tell me they can't offer me any proof as to WHY the transaction was not fraudulent but they were sure that it was a legitimate transaction.
How can they not take the word of the account holder when they call in to report a fraudulent transaction. Thanks PayPal.

I've used CEX before, it's definitely legit, if you are willing to pay the extra in order to buy directly with debit it's a good choice I guess. Just make sure you check out their minimum withdrawal and fees too.

They can't assist me any further... I've already been in bitcoin for 3 years, this has just propelled me to 1. never use Paypal again and 2. buy more bitcoins! 
@_date: 2015-07-14 10:44:45
I can't understand why they call it a "scam" and then here 
They actually say: 
"As you may know, Bitcoin is the digital “cryptocurrency” that has disrupted economies worldwide. It has also made some investors a fortune along the way." and "No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment." 
so contradicting, this is absolutely retarded.

Be careful guys and take care

My friends are all sending me this article today as if I've always been wrong about Bitcoin, but now I am right. 
They are linking me and saying stuff like "you were not so wrong after all" and "So how do you use bitcoin and for what?" 
Articles like this can be very beneficial for the bitcoin growth :)

@_date: 2015-07-06 18:39:37
Yes aaand no, in the sense that in the last 4 years involved with Bitcoin it's been a bit of a crazy ride. 
I've lost money, earnt money, bought drugs, sold all the bitcoins i had to pay rent, bought more bitcoin and have some stuck in wallets which I can't even find anymore... 
All these people (sheeple) are going to gently land their hands on Bitcoin easily and safer than many of us did in the past and for that, I guess they can thank their stubbornness. 
I don't know bro, one way or another, our little baby is growing. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:00:27
This is true,  most people think you HAVE to buy a whole bitcoin...  We've not done a great job at marketing :(

hahaha don't worry dude, I won't buy, because if i do it's gonna drop to 200$ or something. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:36:01
I did ask for proof when calling customer support and and  agent said there were no notes yet...  So 2 days later I get a call from Dublin office and a lady literally shouted at me that I was in the wrong..  I asked for proof of how they concluded the transfer was not fraudulent but she said they could not send me that as it was private data.  On the resolution centre it still says they emailed the person that the money was sent to twice and they didn't receive any reply.  
I get it..  They can't focus on these small problems for each client but yes it sucks luckily I did manage to block it from the bank but now I will probably never be able to use PayPal again as my account is limited until I pay that sum.

Hello, i've visited this website before and the price in ZAR of Bitcoin is quite higher than in other currencies. The company I work for wants to buy bitcoin with ZAR but finds the rate too high, are there any other exchanges or methods to buy Bitcoin in SA that aren't Ice3 or BitX? 
Thank you in advance.

I like the idea, but it has to be more than a Wordpress site with not much information to impress.. I understand you're just launching but I'm getting a bit bored of the endless "services" that are popping up and getting nowhere.. e.g Coinffeine that has been announced for ages. 
I guess we have to be patient and hope they all come flying through one day.

@_date: 2015-04-07 09:22:02
I thought of that for a long time after the Evo Exit scam last month, I could not believe it happened again. 
I do consider that these assholes scammers do "cash out" and even if that does drive the price down, at the same time, it's releasing Bitcoins to new fresh users (hopefully!). 
I get the point that they aren't going to get rid of all of their Bitcoins... but we also can't assume these people are BAD people because of what they did, I've seen users admitting they would do the same, and it's probably a disgusting action to pull on people but hey, the guys currently at the top are corrupt bastards eitherway so, we can't win in that sense, that's pure political corruption.
I don't know man... I want to believe! 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:13:33
I've seen many articles too my friend, saying that Bitcoin can change Africa.. look even if we sent them money through Bitcoin.. they would lose it one way or another...
There are many people doing for example the "SMS" scams in Kenya and other places just texting "Meet Jesus" and a link that will automatically start robbing their phone airtime.. it's insane!! 
I'ts sad readyou but like you said, to really have a gamechanger we need society to stop leeching from the ones that want to prosper.. unfortunately, I don't see that future anywhere near ? :( 
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:00:40

Hi,  
What I would do is make an electrum wallet..  Write down your 12 words on your will with a small tutorial on how to restore the wallet with the seed.  That could be a solution...  If this isn't a safe way someone please do point it out,  for my own knowledge too.  
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:31:47
I do visit that subreddit weekly, even daily. I'm pretty much submerged myself too. 
I've just never put too much at risk financially, I've used it, I have some stored and I'm thinking the basis of it will allow for other people to work on it and improve it.  Don't lose hope just yet!! 
It's only just beginning..
As for humanity,  be good to yourself, the world is messed up and there are more and more of us each day, so many people are still living in the 80s and 90s others are already living in the future. The economy being so unbalanced is partly at fault, but society itself has failed. There are people in South Africa who can barely afford to eat yet they have the latest iPhone and a huge satellite dish sticking out their hut.  So like I said, just live for yourself, be a bit more selfish than usual, give to them who deserves... Don't know what else to say but ultimately, if Bitcoin is ruining your life, let it go. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 09:11:26
I do agree with you, nonetheless, what happened 17 months ago is not happening in the following months, there has been a huge huge development. I can't argue with what you say if we follow trends, but at some point there has to be a game changer. I've used / stored bitcoin for 2 and a half years now and like you said, most of the times we end up crashing down but I'm optimistic as to what is going to happen this summer with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 12:46:45
I understand... I get that to sustain a business fees are a security...  specially when it involves instant money transfers! Best of luck :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:01:17
It's a pretty big spread, I haven't actually used eToro for long. I was investigating it and noticed they had BTC listed there, of course you never buy actual BTC just the position. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:04:20
Yeah I understand that... it's true people can be very clumsy, stupid or just not well informed about Bitcoin and safety... but for example: with an Electrum seed, kept well on a paper somewhere in your house (or a few papers) or learning the words,  you can recover your "Bank"/Wallet anywhere and quickly send yourself more bits then delete the portable exe of Electrum.
I've been getting along doing this but as you said, most people wouldn't know how to do that... 
Also, I'm one of those trial and error persons... until I fuck up I probably won't learn about paper wallets... i really should! If there are huge risks on what I'm doing, please inform me before I lose my bits :P 
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:40:17

@_date: 2015-04-24 08:05:25
I agree for the obvious reasons but also would like to think if it's going to be an accepted "currency" it cant discriminate other currencies. It's like saying if you pay in dollars i'll give you a 10% discount but if you pay Euros a 30% Discount... 
But i totally understand attempting to attract people through promotions into using Bitcoin as a payment, but for the companies it may result in a negative outcome as they will be underselling products in some cases.
Eitherway, Destinia charges a 10€ service fee in most reservations, they could lower that to 5€ for example. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:09:39
hehe no need to be sorry... I work in a company deeply involved in ZA, my manager is from Cape Town and travels a lot around South Africa, [you would be shocked...](

I know, I don't know what to believe either completely. Like there must be SOME cases, but it can't be a majority... My boss claims that the only reason Africa is so poor is because they are useless at managing their money.. "A fool and his gold are soon parted".
I find it brutal but I work at Customer support and you would be shocked how many clients call us, with a Samsung phone who have never heard of the Play store or even know that their phone is a samsung..
"What model type do you have?" 
"Vodafone" 
They are being forced to adapt to modern day technology when mentally they may not be ready? I don't know dude...

I'm still a bit skeptical about the whole Wallstreet thing, they could  [pump and dump]( the shit out of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:22:03
Even if the Governments decided to "hoard" Bitcoin this would ultimately decrease the value so much that it would be pointless for them to hoard it, if you get what I mean...
If there is no high demand anymore due to whatever reasons, say, the Governments own 60% of all Bitcoins, then you can pretty much expect people to have no interest.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:56:40
That's actually more realistic, I guess that the Government doing something like that would have low chances if it can be countered in such manner. I don't know much about trading and I was simply assuming if the Government has most Bitcoins and there is no demand... and no supply because Government is holding, the price would simply remain the same or drop eventually as all people involved would not have interest on using Bitcoin. 
Thanks for your insightful reply though! 
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:34:29

I've been scammed myself by depositing my coins on a stupid fake wallet site once.. and I never gave up, because as you can see the technology behind Bitcoin is perfect.
Think of it like with cars (or anything in life really), you can drive everyday safely forever. Or you can be unlucky and crash, or someone stupid / drunk can come along and hit your car. It doesn't mean you stop driving forever... 
I don't know man, when I lost my bitcoin at the time they were worth peanuts, but if i had that many now I would be buzzing... Anyways, stick around and let's enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 21:10:00
Yes but if you don't control your private keys you don't really have any control over your bitcoins...meaning,  if you keep them on a website online and not a wallet such as Electrum..  You can lose them/have them stolen.  
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:27:35

PLEASE make this a sticky post on the top of the R/Bitcoin reddit. 
We need people to stop using sites as permanent wallets :(
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:57:05
I mean by what I understood, you have to trust that someone nearby is going to drop off something or you, what stops them from just taking your money and leaving (If reputation level seems 50/50 for example). Maybe I just didn't understand it well... 
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:02:15
I've traveled, not excessively, but I understand what you're saying. I was more referring to the fact that you don't need to worry about exchange values and getting charged more for exchanging. 
Exactly like you said in Europe we have some cases like Switzerland or Poland...it would be nice to just land there and be able to pay everything in Bitcoin ! :) 
@_date: 2015-03-08 09:52:08
Hehe perfect! Thanks a lot team :)

Sit them down, show them exactly how easy it is to send $$$ from A to B with Bitcoin - forget the technicallity. Don't try to explain to them exactly how it works, just make them realise it can easily transfer money safely and they won't laugh again. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:52:49
and forever, because it's still less risky for sellers/buyers to use that than to go out on the streets probably. If anything, they will make better ones. 
I'd just like for the separation of Bitcoin from Darkmarkets as it just brings bad press, but these coins being sold to other people is interesting as it means Bitcoins on the hands of some new users, be excited!

@_date: 2015-03-26 15:43:23
I'm actually not familiar with Bitkey sorry for that. 
Visit the [Electrum site]( and like you said you may not be doing transactions all the time, but the way you can function with this is using Electrum as your "Bank/Cold storage" you will basically create a wallet and be given a secret phase that will allow you to recover your wallet at any time write this down on a paper (or 2 or 3 or 4 never be too safe) or somewhere super safe hidden on your PC but it's less safe. Anyways, use Electrum as a cold storage tool and "Keep your private keys offline, and go online with a watching-only wallet.",  keep some BTC on a hot wallet on your phone for example just incase you ever want to use it, say 40$. 
If your wallet was bitcoin core, start updating it because there will be a huge blockchain download file to acquire. I hope someone else can be more helpful to you, I'm really no expert just wanted to ensure you remove your Bitcoin from an online website as we never know when they can be compromised.

There are already many stores  is my own one! Just make a shop, accept bitcoin and donate to charity yourself... 
Or on the other hand, make a platform that will donate directly to charities once a payment is made through it. Like a BitPay with charity donations.

I just don't understand how Circle managed to mess up something that seemed so promising... 
I live in Spain and for a while I was buying Bitcoin with no problems through Circle. Then they went all US only.. now verifications...

I don't need to, it's a clear out scam.. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:52:24
Yo, well first of all, download a wallet to your pc like Electrum for example or Armory , up to you, read about them and take a pick. Just make sure you don't keep them on an online wallet on another website. 
Regarding your wallet.dat there are some recovery services and you may be able to recover it if like you said it's not encrypted, which wallet did you use at the time to store those mined bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:04:08

I always thought of that too..  How cool it would be to travel not worrying about changing currencies..  Technically you can do that to Spain now as you can buy flights with destinia and withdraw bitcoin to most ATM as Euro.  I know the real magic is to use just Bitcoin but soon my friend,  soon.

Well it really depends on when they started developing it and how much they are going to add to it, it seems to be a pretty huge project so I'd give it some time, probably not this month if you're inpatiently waiting. 
Unless someone comes with insights and shares some juicy information, I can't even stipulate how far into the project they are.
Some related articles: 
But no sign of launch dates. :/

It's sad , but I have to agree last night I spend some minutes thinking on how at this rate we won't need banks and regulations ruining Bitcoin. Users themselvs are going to make it fail.

Well he isn't lying on anything he says,  of course on his opinions those are his perceptions on the subject but the theory behind what he says is mathematically correct.
@_date: 2015-03-26 10:59:12
They should make it clear that the small transaction fee may occur if set by their bitcoin wallet.. It doesn't hurt to add to the template heh.

HYIP Basically breaks down to:
One person earns cash
another stays the same
another one loses.
But the winner is always the one running the HYIP, I've played around with these before just for the sake of experience and I can tell you there is never an easy way for you to Cash out, either high minimum withdrawal or a web error etc etc.

@_date: 2015-03-03 20:03:47
It's true, they can be stolen but let's not forget that this applies to nearly everything. Once someone stole a bird from my terrace, including the cage. A poor little bird. Anyways my point is, whoever installs an ATM like this has to make sure it's secured properly. 
:) 
@_date: 2015-03-02 14:38:36
It's actually good that this didn't happen IMO, If Bitcoin price grows too fast and reaches these high prices it will only scare people away - I've found when speaking to friends that the common idea is to assume you can only buy 1 bitcoin at a time, we really need to make things clear when we explain Bitcoin to people who really have no clue what it's all about.  
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:05:28
Jump straight into it! Meet up with your friend, let HIM/HER do the whole process of setting up a wallet (whichever you choose) and send him some bits so you can see their face of amazement... from then on let the interest develop.

Hello! Thanks for reading, Unfortunately, I find Electrum a bit complicated to use and use MultiBit, this is why I didn't choose bitcoinway.com! But I will keep insisting to understand Electrum one day ;) 
Also my partner would want some % into EUR and that's  a safety that BitPay offers! 
I wish your daughter all the best luck with her site! PM it so I can view it if you wish. 
And to end my comment: I also agree and wish that Spain would accept this currency, but we are one of the WORST countries with online payments and online retail :/
Thanks again! 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:51:48
Ok, logged in quickly at work to comment. From what I've grasped this seems promising. You've managed to introduce something a group of people have wanted from Bitcoin for a while (those who want to remain anonymous won't like it but..).
 "Contacts" as labeled by you, seems to me like a keyfactor for digital currencies to work and go mainstream. Way to go! 
Best of luck.

So you have actually experienced this! that's the best feedback I could have received. I appreciate that a lot, honestly. 
I assume you are working now and being paid in BTC. Hopefully one day I can be that type of person too. The EU doesn't seem to be so scared of Bitcoin so let's sit and wait for the innovation to blow everyones minds! ;)

Finally some common sense. It's not about the investment to make profit for us little fishes, it's about the principle of Bitcoin working as a payment system.
We don't care if China, Bolivia or Cyprus or whoever likes or doesn't like bitcoin as long as YOU believe in it and want to use it. 
Good going!
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:26:18
Like on just-dice they have a function where you can deposit bitcoins that become part of the bank roll and depending on the websites performance when you withdraw it you've made or lost money. I'm not sure how it works, was just out of curiosity. No problem! 
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:07:05

Basically AngryRapist, buy the bitcoins, Dont spend them, It is still money. You can sell them when you want or trade or buy something with them the same way you can with money. So don't see it as an investment if you are only going to buy a few bitcoins. It's just a different currency like buying euros or pounds with your $$. And i bitcoin rises then, you've made a good investment.

Isn't it possible that this "crash" is actually just proof that people are spending their BTC rather than keeping them for the profits. And the people who are accepting BTC as a payment method are selling their BTC back to fiat ?
