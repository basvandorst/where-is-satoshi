Thanks, yeah I’m just getting started. Once I get more volume I can get better discounts on the shirts. That being said it’s not a crappy gildan shirt - it’s Bella Canvas which are twice the cost of gildan.

He imagery was also used on iconic capitalist T-shirts sold to wanna-be’s for decades. Entrenching his visage into pop culture forever. I like the contrast and conflicting references here. It’s why I made the shirt.

Valid concern. However I ofc did due diligence and received full permission prior to making this dedicate parody shirt that’s 100% covered under fair use laws. Cheers!

@_date: 2019-05-28 15:36:38

That’s some solid advice. I’m shifting over to gildan instead of Bella canvas. Drops price to 18-20 bucks. 
I’m a fan of black shirts too.

I’d actually really like that award.
