Right that makes sense. More participation in the bitcoin blockchain only strengthens it. 
My original question still stands but I may have to concede that people don’t quite know yet. 
The best thing I could think of for examples of how blockchain technology might enhance systems other than stored value is maybe for record keeping- health records or historical are protected and untampered with when the data is kept honest by a global redundancy/blockchain type system. Perhaps as a data backup solution if a software system backed their data up as a massive distributed piece of data, spread across a blockchain network like a massive RAID redundancy...

So blockchain technology can be used to stabilize a network connection...? How?
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:04:37
Can someone ELI5 how blockchain provides benefit to something like a smartphone? I understand how BTC uses blockchain as a security tool, but what is another application that brings value to my smartphone experience? (I read about decentralized apps using blockchain technology but I don’t quite get what that means) 
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:17:19
Right, that’s pretty cool! I just wonder how. I tried a good ol fashioned google search to see how distributed ledger could do anything other than validate stores of value securely and accurately, and it keeps just coming back to that. I keep hearing blockchain is opening worlds of possibilities in technology, and I’m not being skeptical- I’m genuinely wanting to know how and I can’t seem to get an answer.

They mentioned a hardware wallet component but for some reason I assumed it would be separate from the phones UX and just accessible in the hardware. You’re right, if it’s integrated into the OS it’s probably not safe to hold your coins there.

I’m going to assume you’re female. I do find it a bit comical that many commenters say “it’s all guys and it’s not a problem at all” and they are very likely male. The one commenter who is likely female notes the misogyny she experiences in the community. Thanks for commenting!

Well machine learning is a relatively new field, plumbing has been dominated by men for a long time, since before women entered the work force. I think the explanation for why there is such a gender divide is a bit different between the two. Many blue collar manual labor jobs are dominated by men but not all, but I just don’t know that the reasons are exactly the same for why technology and finance both have fewer women.

What a narrow-sighted comment. It’s like saying “if you’re underpaid, just go find a different job- easy fix!” ...unfortunately the world isn’t so simple
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:00:08
Both very good points- but I don’t think there is any practical reason to want/need equal distribution across and entire field necessarily. What IS important is identifying scenarios where people are unwelcome in a field they are interested in simply because of their gender (or race, sexual orientation, religion/lack-of-religion, etc) and work to fix that. (AGAIN I’m not claiming the BTC necessarily has this problem... it might but I simply don’t know, I don’t think it really does. BTC is typically found through self-discovery online, which men and women both have equal access to. I was actually turned in to it from a friend, and I have a friend group that is a majority interested in crypto but I gather that’s rare)

Very true re: google analytics. 
Problem? I don’t think so, I never suggested it was (though it seems some redditors commenting took it that way and got defensive mighty quick)
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:10:28
Calling someone out for using an offensive slur about trans women does not equal thought policing. I’ll call people out for racist or homophobic behavior too. I’m not policing thoughts just reminding people to check their behavior, and if people don’t know better, educate them that their language will offend people. It’s how we get better.

Both- it’ll be a scary time but you’ll be in the small minority of people who thought ahead and own BTC already, as the price skyrockets. To all your friends who called it a fad, you’ll be saying “I told you so”

They have to swap it out for fiat to spend it in many cases. We need more widespread adoption for it to take over USD for most transactions- however many people do still pay for many things Using their crypto. It takes continuing to educate people about crypto and for BTC to continue edging towards market cap to get to a world where it works as a universal currency. That being said, i know people who store their money in a crypto wallet and not in a bank. I know people who send money to family members over seas in crypto rather than using wire transfer. People do use it as a store of value, probably moreso in developing countries than in places like the US, EU, Australia etc

Honestly I usually buy it with spare cash at the bitcoin kiosks at the grocery store. You lose a bit more in fees (about 8%) but it’s better than wasting it on booze or lottery tickets)

It’s essentially arcade tokens or Disney dollars. It’s just a stored value that is backed by USD. It’s subject to the same inflation so in its own right, anyone using crypto knows that this pseudo-crypto they’re rolling out is worthless. I have however heard the argument that Libra will bring more people into electronic money transfers, since Libra will *hopefully* be easy to convert into cryptos, thus acting as a gateway to things like BTC. We shall see.

Yep, I don’t know the answer. I’m just curious why it is. Why aren’t women interested in machine learning at the same rate men are? I have no idea

I haven’t forced a thing on you. You’ve made it clear you find it acceptable to use the word “shemale” and I’ve made it clear I don’t think that’s cool, and if you intended it as an insult, that’s not cool to talk about trans women that way.

I’ve bought bitcoin at the coinstar machines. Once you get it into CoinMe then send from CoinMe to your wallet, you pay about 8% or 9% in fees. I have been just putting in random pocket cash when I have it- which I used to spend on lottery tickets and decided I was never winning anything. This seemed like a better chance as “winning” something :)
