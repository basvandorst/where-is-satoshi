He didn't want a hypothetical example.  He asked you to name a government that does everything to benefit you and you have no fear of.
If police are the ground floor representatives of government and we have nothing to fear, then surely they are a welcome sight in your rearview mirror when all you want is to get home from work?  I mean, it's for your own good and has nothing to do with the $50-$200 they plan to extract from you.....   right?

Maybe you shouldn't argue.  Maybe you should first understand and then discuss.

Nah.  I don't think you are a bad person.  In fact, I think it is a safe bet that you are a good person.  Even more than that, I think that every single one of your intentions are good!  Even more than that, I think that if I discuss things with you and we can talk things through to their logical conclusions, then you are such a good person that you might be willing to admit you could be wrong and will honestly consider what the results of what you advocate for will actually be instead of what you want them to be!
I'm very optimistic about people.  We all have a lot of potential and life can be really hard sometimes.

What you are saying is that you are in favor of distorting the market for those individuals at the expense of everyone else.
You also set up the false question of it being an either/or situation.  The people in that scenario certainly have more options than one or the other.  They could all choose to move if it isn't efficient to live there.
So what you are advocating for is taking from others so we don't feel bad about people **maybe** losing their homes in way or another.  While this may help 50 or so families, it hurts the millions of people who collectively have to pay for the inefficiency.
We all end up poorer and that is the logical result of your policy proposition.  Spreading the cost around **does not** mean the cost does not exist.

The data suggests that the politicians are actually pretty good at giving the majority what they ask for.  The problem is they don't like the taste of their own medicine.  (I could be wrong, but I believe I heard Russ Roberts (economist at stanford) use Gray Davis as a good example of this.)


This is the "but who will build the roads!" argument.  I'm not asking this in any mean-spirited sort of way.  I genuinely want to know your age if you could tell me?


Who said anything about anarchy?  I notice throughout our ongoing thread that you make a lot of assumptions that are simply not logical or present a lot of false premises to your questions.  I'm not sure what to tell you other than you should try not to unfairly mischaracterize people.  This will not serve you well in life.


And we need people like you... you know.. smart people... people better than the rest of us!... we need people like you to make our decisions for us, right?  I mean.. you ARE a better, smarter, person, so you would surely never be wrong?  Plus you are so principled and ethical that when you have the billions at YOUR disposal, you would never think of wetting YOUR beak a little bit.
I should just trust you, right?


If I touch a hot stove, but never feel the pain, then what incentive do I have to not make that bad decision again?

What if you are wrong?

This is another false argument.  You assume that if "we only had the **right** people involved" then they would surely be benevoloent.  This assumes that those who have the desire for authoritarian power will not seek government positions and only "good" people will.
You don't trust me to decide who the "right" people are and I don't trust you either.  It doesn't mean that there isn't a third option that would let us both live how we choose.


Why not both?  Stop presenting questions as if there can only be 1 of 2 possible answers.  There can be an infinite number of solutions to many problems.


No.  It is not "free will".  It is personal responsibility.  It is not only the ability to make the wrong decision, but that the consequences of both your good and bad decisions fall squarely on your shoulders alone.

You have simply failed to follow sophisticated reasoning to its logical conclusion, you are immoral and have no sense of basic right and wrong when it comes to violence, and you are for authoritarianism as long as "it's for your own good".
Did I miss anything?

You dolt.  Does the government care about people?  Do you really think the State actually gave a crap about the slaves?
Or do you think that it is just a little more likely they were concerned about the revenue they would lose by not being able to farm the tax cows in the south?
Make up a humanitarian reason to declare war, then pillage the resources in the name of "freedom!"
You are almost too stupid for words.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:13:06


You fool.  The civil war was not the war that freed the slaves.  It was the war that made slaves of all of us.

Your logic failed about 10 posts ago.  How much more not-hypothetical can you get than "give me a real example of a government that does everything to benefit you".
You know that your logic fails because governments are run by people who are human and fallible.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:14:48


Good luck to you.  Hope you at least got something from this discussion.

You fundamentally believe that government is a benevolent entity that operates only to serve the people.
The opposing view is that government is a group of imperfect people with their own self-interests who, like most people, become corrupted by the power that they have gradually seized from the populace.  
They, (even with the best of intentions) like any other stranger to any individuals circumstances, are incapable of making the "best decisions" for everyone because of the natural variability in the world.  It is impossible to centrally plan efficient solutions for individuals because of this variability, so it is best left up to the individual to seek out the most efficient solutions for themselves.
