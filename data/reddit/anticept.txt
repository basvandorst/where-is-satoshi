If they are held for more than a year, IIRC there is no capital gains.
Edit: I have been corrected below. There is still capital gains.

Gotcha. Thanks!

Clearly OpticalData does not understand that in today's corporate world, you get rid of incompetent people from your department by promoting them into another. Less paperwork, less lawsuits, and someone else's problem.

Why not buy a few anyways?

Credit union circlejerk.
Edit: i use a credit union and love them. Sometimes the circlejerk gets crazy though.

I swear i read a court ruling against a company for doing something this, and they did not take the ToS as valid notice to the user about the hidden functionality...

Maybe you should come by and help us scrub planes. It sounds demeaning, but that's kinda how I started out. It's actually very addicting and once you step back and look at them, you can't help but to think they want to say thank you.
If you dream on, the reinforcement can definitely help you lose weight! (I was decently big myself)

Oh yeah, by the way, that's a good idea with the network of BTC accepting flight schools! I'll look into how we can list ourselves in a searchable directory for BTCers!

Humans used to be nomadic. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible today, but you really cannot be materialistic for that lifestyle!

I saw the "pilots license for 10 btc" and thought "Why that much? That's about 8k, the running rate for a private license!" Which is why I asked :).

Where would you buy them?

You should put a QR code and address in it, and just ask for donations that way.

Again, these are extreme examples with highly skilled people involved, and serves to show how difficult it is to commit the fraud. Once you get past that barrier, it's wide open, but relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of fraud that goes on with CCs.

You know we also do rental, right?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:54:13
I haven't finished setting up with bitpay, and I'm still not certain with them. Maybe I'm just being overly cautious.
~~As stated, the rates are negotiable, the 10% is the maximum that I would need to take.~~
EDIT: Fuck it. If things end up costing too much or become too risky for BTC, then I'll charge extra or stop accepting it all together. For now, consider the premium struck from the book!
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:29:52
ATM cards maybe, but i am not sure if anything tied to a credit card processor does that yet.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:58:02
There is a lot of fraud with CCs. The thing is though, it's hard to commit. You either need to have access to serious equipment to make the stripes and fake cards, or order online, which of course means you just gave up your address :).
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:44:03
Yeah, I was watching the whole thing unfold... and I'm sitting here twiddling thumbs because I haven't finished entering the bitcoin market...
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:37:18
For most wannabe fraudsters, that's serious equipment.

Flight school, not flight instructor :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:12:58
This is an extreme case example, and is more the exception than the rule.

Also, a shoutout to [Santa Monica Flyers]( on the west coast! They accepted bitcoin openly a little before we did, but I beat them to the punch with my first post here on reddit. Much love to them!
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:21:25
Got ya.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:26:47
Hey Charlie! You aren't the only one offering :P. Here's a shout-out to the Ohio BTCers!
Also, I see your site got redesigned! I recall seeing your add on bitcointalk and it was old like mine :P. Been redesigning mine too! (almost done)
I also posted here already, but in the middle of the night, so it didn't get much attention... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:10:47
Can someone verify what I am seeing? This guy just tipped 500k USD?
I have not seen the bot verify yet, but that's just crazy.
EDIT: as pointed out, there is an i missing in "tip"
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:38:59
You say that now... Maybe you should try it :P.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:48:37
Unless the credit card companies support it, those are not legal to accept because merchant contracts require the original, unaltered card to be presented. Coin is an interesting concept, but a doomed one if they cannot overcome that limitation.
I run a flight training operation, and i know too well about fraud.

Posted a couple videos by the way!

Love my little two seater. All I want :)

I believe GPLv3 does. Don't quote me on that, would like others to confirm.
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:53:02
The merchant isn't allowed to accept cards which are clearly altered or not original. You cannot just buy the cards; you also need to emboss them and raise the print. If a merchant accepts a card without that, that's tough shit on them.

I noticed you fly the sportcruisers. Here in the US, Flight Design aircraft (the light sports that we use) have to be considerably neutered. Do you know what the European version of the sportcruiser can do for cruising speed, if they have one?
We're not exactly a flight school, we're a flying club. However, we straddle that line, so we accept being called either or!
Also, why don't you offer light sport (openly)?
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:49:00
That's because they haven't finished their indoctrination!

I have known about bitcoin for years. Wish I took the leap of faith and actually mined back in the day, I would be much more confident in accepting it now.
The issue I have, is that aviation is a high risk, low return business. The only people who are in it are the ones who love it. When is the last time you've heard about some guy making it big these days by running a flight school?
With that said, any amount of loss hurts badly. REALLY badly. I know bitpay and coinbase are the big names in the market. There's always something that I have not considered, and it's the unknowns that I must be careful of.
