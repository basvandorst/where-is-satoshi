Define lowest risk to the system. To some, that means less likely to introduce an economic fork, to some it means less likely to introduce bugs to the codebase and to others, it means less likely to get double spent against.
All of these scenarios are dangerous and deserve to be considered. I hate how one sided this place has become and how one sided the other place has become.  I use to read the bitcoin reddits every day, but it gives me a headache to see how single minded the two reddit communities are on this topic. Personally I tend to agree with Gavin that the chances of a viable economic fork are slim to none, but since I lack a community that i can ask questions in and get intelligent, considered responses back, I started to become fearful of the future viability of bitcoin.
The funny thing is neither side is wrong. The only ones who are wrong are the ones who split us into these two opposite echo chambers in the first place.  It's become like the two party system in politics, which I hate.  I support larger blocks with a hard fork ASAP.  But now that means that I'm expected to not want Lightning Network and not want Segwit.  It's insanity!

In the end, the only thing that matters is censorship resistant transactions.  Decentralization is just a means to that end.  I'm fine with the hub and spoke model as long as hubs can't decline transactions.
Bitcoin's one and only purpose is permissionless transactions.  As long as that aspect is preserved and protected, I could care less about the network Topology, but my fear is that hubs will become choke points for government regulators.  Can someone offer me a counter argument on why my fears are unfounded?  I want LN to succeed because I see the potential for the instant transactions making point of sales devices viable, but the engineer in me has a lot of skepticism.

It depends how you look at it. If your talking about pure supply vs demand, then you are correct.  However, if you look at the USD value of the reward, then this halving is much bigger by an order of magnitude.  In 2012 the reward fell by $325 from $650.  If the halving occurs with the current prices, then the reward will have dropped by $5,500 from $11,000.

I guess it could technically be done as far as duplicating the ledger and existing addresses, but it wouldn't work as you would expect.
Sidechains are pegged in value to bitcoin.  You need to transfer bitcoins to the sidechain to fund them.  In theory, you could take litecoin and make it into a side chain, but it's value would be equal to the total number of bitcoins used to fund the chain.  Lets pretend that there are a total of 25,000 litecoins in existence.  if the sidechain was funded with 250 bitcoins, then each sidechain litecoin would be worth .01 bitcoins.  Litecoins existing value can't be "ported" into a sidechain without using an equivalent value of bitcoins to fund the chain.  Also, how would mining work?  Unless someone is burning bitcoins to fund the newly mined coins, then each new litecoin on the network would be devaluing the sidechain.
It's not an ideal use of sidechains.  However, if you were working with an alternate blockchain whose main goal was not a currency, then you could port it to a sidechain and leverage the security of the bitcoin blockchain to your advantage.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:07:46
I personally believe that Full-RBF is superior.  The features it enables are very cool.  For example, let's say you transact multiple times before any of your transactions are mined.  Full-RBF would let you merge those transactions into a single transaction and you would actually save on fees.  It's similar to the payment chanel solution except it's on the blockchain, not off chain.  However, it would be irresponsible to enable something like that before we have a market adopted true 0-conf solution, such as Lightning network or some other off chain solution.  I feel that the true power of off chain solutions will be the instant transaction, we are just not there yet.

As someone who has done some programming, (not professionally) I know that it is easy to become attached to a particular solution to a problem. You become so involved with working out the implementation and pondering all the issues that it will solve that it becomes hard to see it as anything other than the perfect solution. I am a little worried that this is what is happening with the lightning network. On paper, it looks like an excellent and elegant solution, but I feel like they may be overestimating it's future impact for the reasons listed above. People are not going to move to it because of how elegantly it solves a problem. There are also concerns like ease of use and adoption that will just take time to work themselves out.
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:28:26


This is basically correct.  The main purpose of sidechains is to create altcoins that are backed by bitcoin and are transferable between the two.  Sidechains only have value because they can be exchanged for bitcoins, but they can't invent bitcoins from thin air.  They can only redeem bitcoins that have been transferred into the sidechain.  You can port the functionality of any altcoin you want, but you can't port their value.

Actually, that is often the case with consumer electronics. Video game consoles in particular. It is standard practice in that industry to sell new consoles at a loss with the expectations that the manufacturing costs will drop eventually, allowing them to make a profit only after their devices have hit the market. Every Nintendo console and every Xbox has done this. Google does this with the Chrome Books. They have enough faith in Moore's law to risk profit margins on it.

This test is pointless. Safe RBF is just starting to be rolled out. RBF is intended to mitigate the clogging of the system during heavy traffic and promote a healthy fee market during those times. The proponents of keeping the block size small are just going to say that the delays that occurred during the "stress test" wouldn't have happened if RBF was implemented at every pool and wallet. The data we will gather won't be useful because we are in the early days of rolling out a solution to some of the issues. It will do nothing to convince believers of small blocks with a fee market to change their minds. Safe RBF allows for some interesting wallet implementations. Imagine if the wallet would automatically bump up the fee slightly after each block is found or after a set number of blocks have passed. You could guarantee that your transactions will be included in a timely manner with a minimum of effort and fees. These are things that we know are coming, so why try to test it before that?
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:19:59
No, it's not like that at all. Currently there is a legitimate risk assessment to accepting 0 conf transactions. You can calculate the risk by watching the transaction relay through the network since miners always prefer the one that arrives first. This patch kills the ability to use that type of risk assessment. It's not perfect and I believe that the true power of off chain transactions will be instant transfers, but currently those options don't exist.

I wasn't claiming that reaching the limit will be a sudden catastrophic event. I was thinking more long term. Hitting the limit won't be a big deal at first. But what if we stay at the limit while transaction volume continues to build? What if the dips in the osolations are no longer enough to clear out the transaction pool. It's when the network has a steady load that is continually outpacing the blockchain that the shit will hit the fan. In my example, i was using a transaction volume that was double what the blocks could handle.

I always liked namecoin because it's trying to do something completely different from bitcoin. It's not trying to be money and they don't care about making it into money. Financially, it's not doing well, but I only need to hold a tiny amount for it to be useful so my exposure to it is negligible. My total investment is 1 namecoin. Even though I bought it high, I only lost $4. I love how i can renew my domain via a bash script that I wrote. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside in a nerdy way even if no one ever uses my .bit domain.

That only works as long as they are competing against spam or low priority transactions. What will happen when they are competing for space against legit transactions? The truth is no one knows. That is scary and any large company is certainly not going to risk their future on unknowns.


I agree that there is an intrinsic value to this layer, but I feel that it's value should be set by the free market of miners choosing what their minimum fee is.  Allowing an artificial limit on that resource is manipulating those economics.  I say let the free market work.  The miners know what resources are available to them.

How much space does an electrum node require and is it compatible with a pruning node?

It's not altruism. It's a belief that an entity that is heavy invested in the bitcoin ecosystem will not want to tank the economy by destroying the currently existing business models for an extra couple of cents per block. Also, that will trickle down to the miners who are pointing their power to the pools. No one in the bitcoin ecosystem wants to see businesses stop accepting bitcoin. That is not altruism, its good business sense. My point has already been proven by f2pool already changing their mind to the version that will only accept transactions with the same outputs. The system works. All parties involved will look out for their best interests. That's where my faith lies.

I used Docker so I could run it in Arch Linux. I wanted to take advantage of the bitcoin-core-git package in the AUR repo to simplify the compiling process. It's not necessary to do that, but I have some experience with Docker and I'm an Arch fan boy. It made things more complicated than it needed to be, but it's useful if you want multiple versions of bitcoin-core installed.

All he is is the owner of some public forums. That doesn't give him the right to decide what we are allowed to think. He's not a developer, he's not involved in bitcoin in any technical capacity, but that doesn't matter.
I'll try to articulate in words what it is exactly that triggers a feeling of dictatorship.  You need to realise that the very essence of bitcoin is anti-authority.  It is irrelevant if he is right or wrong.  The fact that he doesn't realise this almost makes him an outcast in the bitcoin community.  It feels like he's very disconnected from the general culture around here and on top of that we are being forced to agree with his opinions.
Do you remember the backlash against the founding of the Bitcoin Foundation.  Granted, the Bitcoin Foundation turned out to be worthless in the end, but they didn't do anything bad in their very early days and yet the bitcoin community automatically distrusted them.  Ironically, one of their explicit goals was to be a neutral party that could provide the bitcoin devs with a paycheck.  Now we have Blockstream in that position as soon as the Bitcoin Foundation filed for bankruptcy.  (Don't take that the wrong way. I'm glad that they are getting a paycheck for their important work.)
Even Satoshi himself was extremely anti authority.  He hated that he was seen as an authority figure and he left entirely when Gavin spoke to some government authorities.  For better or for worse, anti authoritarianism is a core belief of bitcoin and nothing Themos can do will change that.

The issue is, whether intentionally or unintentionally, Ken Hess has twisted the meaning of "legal currency" to suit his own needs.  Legal currency in the context of the senator's response is referring to legal tender.  Bitcoin is not legal tender, only the USD is.  If a currency is not legal tender, that means that you can not force someone to accept it as payment. You can't force a shop keeper in the US to accept bitcoins just like you can't force him to accept Euros, bars of gold, or even credit cards. The shop keeper has the right to demand Federal Reserve notes as payment. Printed on all US dollars, it says "This note is legal tender for all debts public and private."  That doesn't mean that all other currencies are illegal.  It just means that the law doesn't guarantee that everyone will accept them as payment.
If you do contact the senator, don't be adversarial. Just politely make him aware that his words are being used out of context with a different meaning.

That can only work for so long though. It will probably happen as you describe when we first hit the limit, but as pool of unconfirmed transactions gets bigger, some transactions will get dropped. People will start to put bigger and bigger fees out of fear of there transaction never being confirmed, further pushing up the average fee. Even unimportant transactions need to get into the blockchain eventually. Granted, the scenario above won't play out the instant we hit the block size, but it's only a matter of time if the network continues to outpace blocks.

Just playing devil's advocate for a second, he does have a point about one thing. Right now bitcoin only has value because it can be used as a medium of exchange for fiat. Let's pretend that every exchange closed tomorrow. How much wealth would one bitcoin represent then? How useful would it be then? The day that we can say that bitcoin has officially succeeded is the day that a bitcoin holds value without referencing it's price in other currencies. For this to happen, goods and services need to be priced in BTC without being pegged to a dollar amount. This can't happen until the volatility comes down to something reasonable. Volatility can't come down until it sees an increase market adoption and liquidity, so that puts us in a chicken or the egg situation. However, what does "something reasonable" actually mean? If bitcoin is already less volatile than your local currency, is it already good enough? Setting prices in BTC will begin in places like Argentina where their local currency is unstable and bitcoins are actually more stable. It's already starting to happen. True bitcoin economies will start in places like that and as adoption increases, it will spread to more countries as the volatility goes down in comparison to the local currency. It may be many years, maybe even decades, until we start seeing prices set in BTC in the USA, but that day may be closer than we think in other parts of the world.
TL;DR:  The day that we can determine the value of a bitcoin by looking at a price tag on a shelf instead of looking at an exchange rate with another currency is the day that we win.

If I understand their business model correctly, there using 3 signature keys and the bitcoin protocol requires 2 to do a transaction. The 3rd key will be held by a separate company that is partnered with them that resides in a different regulatory environment. The idea is that if you die, your family can get the money by presenting your death certificate to this third company and it gives the costumer someone to go to if they lose their keys without giving Neo access to your wallet. It also gives customers a way to withdraw their money if Neo goes under. This only applies to their full bitcoin accounts. I'm not sure how it will work for their Euro pegged bitcoin accounts.

That wasn't why they were seized.  Fincen made an announcement saying that the exchanges need to register for money transmitter licences.  One month later, MtGox still wasn't compliant, so the funds were seized.  It's incompetence all the way down.

I think it's much more likely that no one buys them.  I believe MtGox will instead sell its user base to another exchange.  Think about it.  It's the only asset they have left that's worth anything.  They have about half a million "verified" customers.  A user base that large which can legally transact unencumbered with you is worth a lot.  I believe that some smaller or new exchange will make that purchase.  All MtGox accounts will be transferred to this other exchange, and after MtGox goes through bankruptcy court, users will be paid back a percentage of what they are owed based on the division of Gox's remaining funds.

They were fully compliant. The issue was they used one bank account for all of their customer's money.  One of their customers were caught dealing with Silk Road and therefore the entire bank account was seized.  It wasn't all doom though.  They managed to return funds to all their customers several months later after the legal issues were settled.  They were literally shutdown by regulators because of one costumer doing business with Silk Road.

I think the point being made wasn't that it's a serious contender. They were mentioning it as an example of a cryptocurrency that offers different functionality that other bitcoin based alt coins can't. If bitcoin fails, it's more likely that it's successor will be something completely different and not just a rehash of the same features. I don't seriously believe that will be ripple, but currently it's the only cryptocurrency that uses a different system/code base than bitcoin. None of the other alt coins can be considered a technological game changer. (Except maybe namecoin.)

Paper wallets are extremely easy to use.  People tend to overcomplicate things when they talk about it.  A fresh install on a Linux computer that has never seen the internet is the safest way to do it, but there are varying degrees of security.  For example, I already run Linux on my computer and I have a certain degree of trust that it's not infected by any viruses since there are currently no known Linux viruses in the wild.  Now, this is a risk that I'm taking because there could always be a yet unknown virus on my PC, but in my personal opinion that risk is low enough that I am willing to risk it.  To date, I have never heard of a Linux virus that is able to spread on it's own and I have yet to hear about any home PC running Linux ever getting an infection.  It's usually a server somewhere that was specifically targeted by hackers.  When I want to generate a paper wallet, I just unplug my ethernet cable to rule out being scammed by the paper wallet generator website itself.
That said, **I would not trust any Windows PC with this task ever!**

They basically have three income sources.
1.  They will buy and sell bitcoins for customers as a broker the same way that Coinbase does.
2.  The Bee payment network.  The first 1000 customers will be added for free, but all customers after that need to may a fee for their POS equipment.
3.  They plan to offer remittance services to customers who may or may not be interested in using bitcoins.
There is also a 4th income plan, but this one is a bit iffy.  They hope to make money off the increasing value of bitcoin over time through their Euro locked accounts.

He just wants to drive down the price of bitcoin so he can buy back what he sold before MtGox closed, and because he owns a bitcoin insurance company. The more panic in the air, the better it is for him. If he disclosed his info now it would blow over too soon. He wants to stretch out the panic as long as possible. It's very possible he has real info about a scandal of some sort, but he only cares about manipulating the scene to his advantage. If he gave two shits about "the bitcoin community" or "purging bad actors" he would have revealed his info already. Even if his info turns out to be true and he reveals something terrible like the Bitcoin Foundation was using their money to buy hitmen or something, he will still be nothing more than a manipulative asshole for sitting on that information to his own personal gain.

If I understand that chart correctly, It looks like someone bought about 19,000 BTC all at once with fake fiat that was hacked into their system.  19,000 is a huge number of BTC and it looks like they halted trading within 5 minutes of the hack. If this money was successfully stolen, then there would have to be a huge transaction of over 19,000 BTC on the blockchain around the time they halted trading. If there is no large transaction on the blockchain at that time, then they were not able to withdraw it and their money is probably safe.  What time did this all happen?  We can see on the blockchain if they lost the money or not.

*I actually just posted this in a different thread but I just noticed that this is the main Warren Buffet thread here, so I'll just copy and paste my own post since it's relevant to this.*
Just playing devil's advocate for a second, he does have a point about one thing. Right now bitcoin only has value because it can be used as a medium of exchange for fiat. Let's pretend that every exchange closed tomorrow. How much wealth would one bitcoin represent then? How useful would it be then? The day that we can say that bitcoin has officially succeeded is the day that a bitcoin holds value without referencing it's price in other currencies. For this to happen, goods and services need to be priced in BTC without being pegged to a dollar amount. This can't happen until the volatility comes down to something reasonable. Volatility can't come down until it sees an increase market adoption and liquidity, so that puts us in a chicken or the egg situation. However, what does "something reasonable" actually mean? If bitcoin is already less volatile than your local currency, is it already good enough? Setting prices in BTC will begin in places like Argentina where their local currency is unstable and bitcoins are actually more stable. It's already starting to happen. True bitcoin economies will start in places like that and as adoption increases, it will spread to more countries as the volatility goes down in comparison to the local currency. It may be many years, maybe even decades, until we start seeing prices set in BTC in the USA, but that day may be closer than we think in other parts of the world.
**TL;DR: The day that we can determine the value of a bitcoin by looking at a price tag on a shelf instead of looking at an exchange rate with another currency is the day that we win.**

Eventually, the transaction fees are going to have to cover the mining.  The transition shouldn't be a big deal though.

This actually is improving.  With pruning, you still need to download the whole blockchain but you don't need to worry about limited disk space.  The only thing a pruning node can't do is serve old blocks to new nodes syncing to the network, and now with 0.12, pruning nodes can now serve the blocks that they do have.
Also, there has been some talk about sharing the UTXO dataset via a torrent style method to new nodes so that even downloading the whole blockchain initially will become optional.  However, this has some trust issues that need to be further analysed before it can be safely implemented.

My fear of Lightning network is that while it may be open source and anyone can operate the hub software, it's a fairly safe assumption that the big hubs will be required to operate under a money transmitter licence.  If you have an unlicenced hub, who will integrate into your services?  I really doubt that using a LN hub will be any different from using Coinbase or Circle.
Also, as far as what your saying about big blocks causing mining centralization, that is a technical limitation, not a philosophical one.  I think that there is a safe middle ground to be found when it comes to technical limitations, and it must be continually reassessed because technical bottlenecks change over time.  I sincerely believe that it's the ideological differences that are the real problem.  Everything else is just noise.

This is why changing their license was an overreaction. They have a superior product and can charge a premium for it. Maybe not a $120 premium, but they should have expected the need to lower their prices once competition entered the market.  He's right, Satoshi Labs didn't properly understand the implications of the GPL license.  The Chinese knock off company did nothing wrong. I wouldn't buy one because I don't want to trust large amounts of cash to cheep hardware, but the code is free for anyone to use. They are under no obligation to innovate. The rules of GPL are free to use, free to sell,  and free to modify under the condition that all further modifications you make are also released under the GPL license so others my benefit from your innovation. The idea behind GPL is you save on R&amp;D costs by leveraging the innovations of your community and your competition. They clearly didn't understand this when they drew up their business strategy.
In other words, the GPL license literally means that you may not have a software advantage over anyone else who uses your software. This excited members of the community because we thought it ment that Satoshi Labs was willing to continually innovate to stay ahead of the competition.  If they thought that their competitive advantage would be purely on the software level, then the never should have used that licence.  Now they have destroyed their image by showing how little faith they have in their own products.

Maybe some of us agree that adding layers is a good path to scalability but don't want to be held back while waiting for those solutions. That's why 2MB is gaining support even though it's not a permanent fix.  You say that the blockchain can't scale indefinitely.  Fine, I concede that point, but that doesn't mean it can't scale above 1MB.  We should be allowing it to grow unrestricted until there is a viable alternative to on chain scaling, which according to the core devs, isn't far off.

The technical reason is because SegWit doesn't provide an actual increase in blocksize unless every wallet developer updates their software and people start making SegWit transactions.  And if every wallet updates and every user chooses to make every transaction a SegWit transaction, that only gets us to 1.6MB.  No one on either side is against SegWit.  It provides some great improvements to the system such as faster transaction validation and fixing transaction malleability, but it does very little for blocksize.

Miners have less control in the event of a hard fork than you imagine. Lets say that there is a fork that makes most of the merchants happy, but a majority of the miners are against it. If a couple of key payment processors and exchanges announce that they are moving to the new fork, suddenly the old fork is worthless because it can't be exchanged for anything of value. Consensus works in both directions. Miners are not going to mine tokens that can't be exchanged for fiat. They would be the ones dragged kicked and screaming to the new fork.
You could actually think of bitcoin as a three party political system. You have the vendors/payment processors, the exchanges, and the miners.

Through to the end of 2013 I used the reference client as my wallet.  It was slow and clunky.  If I needed to send bitcoin to an exchange to sell, I couldn't do anything until it synced, and that could take hours.  If you wanted to send money quickly, it was easier to leave it running.  Eventually alternative wallets came out.  Now I use a combination of paper wallets, an Android wallet and Electrum, none of which operate as nodes.  Now I run a node on a hosted VPS.  My reason for turning off my home node wasn't because of technical limitations.  It's because it was a bad wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-31 14:55:30
I'm concerned about the security implications of allowing non segwit nodes to stay on the network in a segwit world. At best, they offer no value to the network other than being a dumb relay. At worst, they create a weak spot and a possible attack vector. There should be a hard fork that simple invalidates non-segwit aware nodes so they can't pose any risk. What happens if someone makes a bot that connects to hundreds of nodes and tries to spend the anyone can spend transactions?  The segwit aware nodes will probably ban the incoming connections that relayed the invalid transactions, but the old nodes will be none the wiser. Eventually the p2p network will split into two groups of connected peers with little to no interconnection between the two and the older half would be unaware of any problems.  The blockchain might not fork, but the p2p network would be a mess. I feel that hard forking at the start and forcibly removing the non-segwit nodes with a consensus change is healthier for the network.
@_date: 2015-05-13 13:26:50
That is outright impossible. It doesn't matter how efficient the miners are. Difficulty scales. Any spike in bitcoin production through mining would be a flash in the pan before the network adjusts in a week or so.
The only possible worry would be Intel have over 51% of the hashing power, but if it is really that cheep, everyone would buy one and the mining cost shoots back up.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:14:38
This is the major thing. It's the fact that we are close to the limit that this is an issue. The attacker probably only needs to generate .1mb to .05mb of spam to accomplish this. The issue is us riding this close to the limit exposes us to a very cheep attack vector that will only become cheaper.

What if the purchases were from different merchants.  Granted, it's not very useful unless transaction fees are prohibitively expensive, but it could make sense for exchanges and mining pools that need to send out lots of payments to lots of addresses.

@_date: 2016-03-07 21:07:26
That's actually a very funny concept.  When you spend bitcoins, you are actually burning unspent outputs to create new outputs at different addresses.  If they were to send you those bitcoins, those virgin outputs would be lost.  They would still trace their lineage back to that early block, but are they still the same "old" bitcoins?  The only way to truly buy "old" bitcoins would be to buy the private key from the owner without actually moving the bitcoins.  However, now you are faced with the security issue of how do you know that you have the only copy of those keys.  The original owner could have made a copy and steel the bitcoins back after collecting your money.  You could never trust that they are truly in your control until you move them into a new address, but then you just defeated the original purpose.

Also, please explain how it is harmful to the network.  The way I see it, it opens up more bandwidth to the bitcoin network.

If you were talking about having an unlimited block size I'd agree that we need much more testing to see if it's safe, but we're not. This is a one time step up to 2 MB. The only real disagreement at this point is purely political.  We need Lightning Network too, but it isn't here yet.  I personally in vision LN becoming the standard for point of sale systems, but we shouldn't hope to move a majority of our commerce to LN.  There has been a lot of discussion of if LN is decentralized or not. Some argue that LN is decentralized since anyone can operate LN hub. Will I be able to operate a LN hub from my home Internet? (Since that is the standard they are using for nodes, it's a fair comparison.) Personally i think that detail isn't quite so important. I think a better read on decentralization is if some hubs get shutdown, will it be inconsequential to the functionality of the network or not?
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:05:51
Close, but not exactly.  I can't speak for "People", but I can speak for myself.  SegWit is a great idea and should be implemented because it solves lots of problems.  However, it doesn't really help with us avoiding hitting the blocksize limit.  It will take several more months before it will be released and even then, we won't see any benefit until wallet software implements it, so several more months still.  If we do reach a point where every wallet implements it, that only gets us to 1.6MB.  The 4MB number is a theoretical max size if there are blocks filled completely with the largest possible multisig transactions.  A vast majority of transactions currently are the standard single sig transactions, therefore 1.6MB is more accurate.
Also, there is the issue that they want to implement it as a soft fork by signing all SegWit transactions as "anyone can spend" to maintain backwards compatibility with older clients.  This basically lets non-SegWit clients stay on the network, but in a confused state and without validating the legitimacy of any of the transactions.  Many feel that it would be much cleaner and safer from a security point of view to implement it as a hard fork rather than keep non-verifying nodes on the network.  Would you be willing to send/receive a SegWit transaction if say only 15% of the nodes on the network could understand and verify it?

That only gets us to 1.7mb and only if every wallet implements it.  In reality, it will take many months for it to be added to wallet software.  It's a slow upgrade.
**These are the facts.**
The real issue is a fundamental divide on how bitcoin will function when the block reward withers away.  Some believe that transaction fees can only be high enough to support the miners if there is an artificial limit forcing people to compete for space, and failure to do so will result in a death spiral where miners will just shutdown and the security of the network will be compromised and completely kill bitcoin.  Others believe that allowing for a high volume of transactions through the natural growth of the network will allow many smaller fees to support the miners and that creating a cap on how many transactions can exist on the network will completely kill the utility of bitcoin.
**These are my opinions worded as dispassionately and emotionless as I can make them.**
The issue is that both sides are diametrically opposed to each other and there is no compromise that exists between these two viewpoints.  You can't have room for growth and use fees to compete for limited space.  Compromise can be found on issues surrounding technical limitations, which is what Bitcoin-Classic is doing by talking directly to the miners, but it's not so easy to find compromise with the engineers.  Here's how the two scenarios play out in my head.  The blockspace pressure being used to create a fee market will allow bitcoin to survive if bitcoin remains a niche technology, but completely kills any chance of it becoming mainstream without the use of a hub and spoke (centralised) services like Lightning Network.  The unlimited space scenario will cause bitcoin to die if it doesn't eventually catch on since the miners will require a high volume of transactions to pay the bills, but if it does have high adoption, we will have something a lot closer to what was promised by Satoshi in the white paper.  This is what Gavin was referring to when he said that we need to plan for success, not failure.  Also, that's what people mean when they say that one day bitcoin will be worth either $1,000,000 or $0.  Limiting the blocksize small enough to create pressure can solve that all or nothing problem, but at the expense of limiting our potential.

It's for a use case that doesn't exist yet but may in the future. Online purchases for goods that will be shipped can wait 6 confirmations without inconveniencing the user. If you were planning on making multiple purchases, you could use RBF to merge the transactions into one, saving you transaction fees.

Since this translation is hard to read, here is a summary of the important parts.
Due to Core's renouncement of the HK agreement, a group of Chinese miners representing over 75% got together and agreed on a plan to implement a 2MB hard fork.
They will all switch to mining Bitcoin Classic except for one pool which will continue to mine Core.  The pool mining Core will be designated the "Terminator Pool."  The Terminator pool won't switch until a 75% threshold has been reached without it's help.  The idea behind this is to create a 90% activation threshold on Classic.
This will only happen if Bitcoin Classic merges SegWit into it's codebase.  Otherwise, they will remain on Core.
They will immediately switch back to Core if they implement a 2MB hard fork.

For sending transactions, you are correct. For receiving transactions, it's a different story. Segwit transactions will be signed "anyone can spend" on the existing chain to maintain backwards compatibility. If you don't upgrade, will your wallet be aware that for those transactions that there is a new dataset to check? No, not unless you upgrade your wallet. 
Segwit will require upgrading for anyone who transacts in bitcoin. The difference between the hard and soft versions is that with the soft fork nodes that don't upgrade will still be relaying half the valid dataset.  But those same nodes will no longer be validating those transactions because they are signed "anyone can spend".  Are those nodes actually adding value to the network?  My personal opinion is that from a computer science perspective, soft fork Segwit is like jumping through lots of hoops and bending over backwards for minimal gain. 
All that being said, I do believe that soft fork Segwit is better than no Segwit at all. The only thing that I disagree with is when people say that upgrading is optional because it's a soft fork. This is only true for nodes. The entire Bitcoin Economy will still be forced to upgrade regardless of which implementation of Segwit wins and people need to know this.

Lighting Network is reliant on nodes that operate off chain. This part is fine and can theoretical be achieved in a decentralized manor. 
However what happens if Amazon runs their own Lightning node for processing payments? Well Amazon is a u US based company and will be required to act as a gatekeeper for who can connect with their node. The will likely have a registration process similar to Coinbase where you need to give them your identity.
Ok, fine. What if you simply don't lock in your funds on Amazon's node? Lightning network does have some sort of inter node transaction ability. We'll Amazon can decide which nodes can connect and which can't. They can simply block any nodes which don't meet their regulatory requirements.  The result will be the smaller nodes that can't afford the fees to comply or do not wish to violate their users privacy will be cut off from the majority of the economy.
The stated reason for Bitcoin's creation is to be a censorship proof payment system. If there is ANY level of gatekeepership over who can send payments where, then bitcoin is dead. This new bitcoin may be successful. It may even make those of us who hold it rich, but it would still be dead. 
Edit: in my opinion, the only way the Lightning network can be implemented in a decentralized manner is if each node does not know where its cross nodes transaction originate from and they have no choice but to accept all incoming transactions as a result.

I agree with most of what you said except for the whitepaper argument. 
Try thinking of it on different terms. Imagine if bitcoin was a publicly traded company and that the bitcoins themselves are shares in this company. In this scenario, the whitepaper is almost like a list of announced business plans and goals. If you have a large amount of money invested in this company because you saw potential in their stated goals and plans, you would be pissed off if they decided to abandon the reason you invest in the first place. I know this happens all the time in the real business world, but this isn't a business. It's an open source project. Not only that, a large amount of the early adopters bought bitcoin for ideological reasons, not for price speculation.  At least in the business world, investors will be satisfied by returns on investment. Early investors probably hold a majority of the coins and they won't be satisfied until bitcoin takes over the world because of a shared set of beliefs. To them, bitcoin is a religion the same way that open source is a religion to Richard Stallman, and there is nothing wrong with that.

@_date: 2015-08-18 10:50:01
That's why it's not rejecting the blocks as invalid; because there will be some false positives. It just delays the propagation for whatever amount of time is determined.  Right now there are about 6000 nodes on the network. Lets say that 5% of them falsely identify a block as being SVP mined. That means 5700 nodes will relay the block without delay and the remaining 300 nodes just wait a second or two before relaying the block. The effect on block propagation time should be negligible in theory.  Now lets image that a SPV mined block is found with only a coinbase transaction. Now 100% of the nodes will identify it and each hop from node to node will wait the maximum amount of time. I Even if that wait is small, lets say 3 seconds, that will increase the propagation time for that block exponentially because it will need to be relayed multiple times before it propagates to the whole network and each node receiving the block will be adding more delay.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:27:59
I personally don't think Lightning needs fee pressure to succeed.  I think the killer feature will be it's ability to do instant transactions and I hope that it does succeed in doing that.  As far as scalability goes, LN requires that an economic majority of commerce move to a semi-centralised hub and spoke system, and that always rubbed me the wrong way.
In my own head, I see LN becoming a competitor to Gyft.  Imagine putting bitcoin into an n-locktime transaction as a Starbucks gift card.  I could even see them offering discounts for longer term n-locktime channels.

That is disingenuous. Let me give you the actual reason XT supporters believe.
The reason why the 1 mb chain wouldn't survive a fork is because it would have a 40 minutes block time and the next difficulty adjustment would be 2 months away. Also, the one and only thing miners give a damn about is their return on investment. They don't care about the philosophical issues or the drama. During the 2 week countdown, the miners will be demanding concrete decision by the pools one way or the other.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:54:00
Could you expand on your logic here?  I'm scratching my head trying to see your reasoning.  Just because someone plans to run XT today, doesn't mean you have to continue to run it tomorrow.  Lets say that hypothetically the hard fork is successful and large blocks become dominant due to miners running XT.  How does your scenario play out?
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:18:47
To be honest, I was assuming that they were already doing what you described.  The issue is as blocks get larger, it takes longer to validate and the miners will be mining on unvalidated blocks for longer.  This isn't even a large block / small block issue.  It starts to show up as a problem even with 1 mb blocks.  Could you imagine how insecure SPV mining will become with the larger blocks being proposed?  Just validating the header is good enough for their profits but it isn't good enough from a security point of view.

I wasn't really suggesting that the block be considered invalid. Only that the propagation is delayed slightly. The worst case scenario is if your node falsely identifies a block as being SVP mined due to variations in the mem pool, it waits a couple of seconds for one of the included transactions to reach the minimum age before propagating it. It doesn't require every node to be in agreement because it's not rejecting the block. The idea is to increase the orphan rate for SPV miners, not to make SPV mining impossible.

You don't have to wait for it to be mined to confirm if the transaction is valid. The transaction was literally signed with random numbers instead of the private key. This is inexcusable.

You're actually wrong.  I know this because I run both an XT node and a big blocks only node for some testing I was doing.  Nodes have a variable called "SubVer".  My XT node declares itself as "/Bitcoin XT:0.11.0/", while my big blocks only node declares itself as "/Satoshi:0.11.0/", which is indistinguishable from the core client except for the version variable is set to 70010 in support of BIP101.  They are very much distinguishable from each other.
Also, when I run "bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep subver" on my XT node, I get:
        "subver" : "/Satoshi:0.10.0/",

I can prove that as false with evidence right now.
By looking at the chart, you can see a decline in the average number of core nodes by about 400 while the total nodes grow by 900.  That means that a little less than half of the BIP101 nodes are nodes that switched. It's save to assume that those nodes are not fake. Half of the BIP101 nodes would be 450. It's not unreasonable to assume that more than 50 new nodes legitimately came online due to the controversy. You can't just make up statistics like its fact. In fact it's conservative to assume that more than half of the BIP101 nodes are real.

Someone already analyzed the signature of that transaction. It doesn't even have valid keys for the address he was trying to spend from. Blockchain.info is showing blatantly invalid transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:00:19
Your current bitcoin (pre fork) are completely safe.  Also, XT won't fork the blockchain any time soon.  It will wait until at least Jan 2016, and even then, it won't fork until at least 75% of the miners are using XT and it's maintained above 75% for two weeks.  If/When the hard fork happens, you will suddenly have bitcoins on both forks.  In theory, one set of coins will be worthless and the other set will be accepted as Bitcoin.  There is no special action that needs to be taken by you to preserve your coins.  When it becomes time for you to spend your coins, the only thing you need to worry about is the version of your wallet software.  The worst case scenario is you accidentally spend your worthless coins instead of your real coins, because you failed to update your software.  Your real coins won't mysteriously vanish.

No bitcoin split will ever be persistent. At the end of the day, one fork will have a value and the other will be zero. The way the forks are being proposed, the new fork will either have a super majority of miners, or it won't fork.

The efficiency gain happens if you try to send multiple transactions before the next block is found. RBF lets your wallet merge those transactions into a single transaction, saving space in the blocks and saving you tx fees. The reason that full RBF is better than safe RBF is unless you have a large number of unspent outputs in your wallet, you can't utilize this feature.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:39:38
If full RBF is implemented before an instant transaction system exists, which do you think is more likely. Will BitPay and Coinbase stop guaranteeing 0-conf transactions for their vendors (which is one of their cornerstone features), or will they make deals with the miners that prevent them from getting double spent against and continue accepting 0-conf as usual? I feel like it would give incentive to bad behavior simply because we are rushing to include new features.

I fully support the concept behind full RBF. I just hope you do the responsible thing and wait for a viable instant transaction solution to hit the market, (Lightning for example) and not just implement it as soon as possible as a way to force the ecosystem to move faster. It needs to evolve naturally. I personally believe that the killer feature of the Lightning Network proposal is instant transactions. 0-conf on the blockchain is already insecure enough that companies would move to a more secure alternative if one existed. I feel that safe RBF is a fair compromise at least until you bring Lightning to market. I don't see the benefit in breaking the current broken system before a viable solution exists. Doing so will only push people into the unsavory mining contracts that we are trying to avoid.

This depends how you define the bandwidth bottleneck.  If your talking about the total required bandwidth over time, then is correct that it's only a 12% improvement.  If you're talking about the high download and upload peak required to quickly propagate a block with a reasonable orphan rate, then you are wrong.  These improvements are an order of magnitude faster.  I'm tired of seeing these improvements be disregarded as only a 12% improvement.  This was built to solve the specific problem of peak bandwidth requirements for block propagation, and this solves that.

But the difference is this is built directly into the node, not a separate network.  It's one less technical barrier for node operators, not just miners.  It would allow those with slower connections to contribute to the network.  I have a gamer friend that tried running a node from home but stopped because his internet would lag every time a new block was found.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:12:08
That happened because the miners were not verifying transactions.  It was also a soft fork which means that old versions will still accept the newer bip66 blocks as valid. Also, with a soft fork any miner still running the old version can create a blockchain fork at any time.
With a hard fork, that can't happen. The new blocks after a hard fork are not backwards compatible with older versions. Once the fork occurs, it is permanent. It effectively cuts off the old versions from participating in the network. Depending on the super majority threshold of miners used to trigger the fork, the hashing rate on the old fork would crash so low that it could be stuck in a situation that leaves it with a block interval of hours or even days. Not only that, but with the increased block time, the next difficulty adjustment could be months or years away. While a few stubborn miners could keep the chain alive in that situation, who would use it in that scenario?

Just so you are aware, "Beta" has different definitions depending if you are talking about a piece of software or if you are talking about a protocol.  Beta software means it's buggy, untested.

Bitcoin, the protocol, is most definitely still beta and will probably remain that way for the foreseeable future.

Why should I trust what any like minded group of people decide.  I want the difference of opinion.  It is now nearly impossible to have a discussion about block size because the community split into two polar opposite echo chambers.

I don't believe miners can run pruned nodes. Also, even those running pruned nodes still need to download the full blockchain. The idea behind this is older blocks are requested much less frequently then the newer blocks. This allows for those with limited space to contribute to the network by hosting the blocks that have the most demand on the network. If you buy a vps, most places charge a lot for extra storage space. This helps a lot with decentralization.

Transaction fees are only an effective fix while the competing transactions are either spam or unimportant.  The economics of that solution can't function when you have over 1mb of legit transactions fighting for block space.  How will higher fees fix the problem when the transactions are not spam?  Logicly, not all transactions can be included.  Therefore, the transaction fee will attempt to find the point at which people are just barely willing to still use the system.  In the meantime, the bitcoin protocol will behave unreliably by dropping legit transactions.  Also, the process of finding a balance between a higher transaction fee and simply not using the network will not be smooth.  Markets tend to overshoot.  The required fee to be included in a block will be as volatile as the price.  It will have exponential spikes into ridiculously expensive prices as well as crashes.
This would be a completely different scenario if there was a reliable mechanism to move transactions off chain during times of high volume and transaction fee spikes, but such a system is unproven and non-existent.  I feel like some people are ignoring the economics of the situation because they see the engineering beauty of their own solution.  I actually agree that Lightning Network is a genius and beautiful solution to moving transactions off chain, but they shouldn't be artificially limiting the capacity of the blockchain until after there are battle tested solutions to off chain transactions avalable.

As someone who works in a supermarket and hangs the price changes every week, I would like to know how inflation is calculated. I've seen the prices come close to doubling over the last few years. It blows my mind that anyone can say that there is no rapid inflation right now.

I guess you could call them lost. It would be more accurate to say that they were never created. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:45:25
The real answer is it depends.  I am going to assume you are referring to BIP109, which adds a maximum transaction size of 100K. In that case, time locked transactions that are over that limit and haven't come to full term yet will become invalidated.  However, the bitcoins are not destroyed (or confiscated).  They will simply be in the original wallet that created the now invalid transaction.  Also, has confirmed that the transactions locked by Blockstream are not over this limit and are therefore unaffected by this.
There are some real issues here that need to be considered, but I feel that is blowing this out of proportion.  First of all, while it's not a consensus rule, there already is a transaction size soft limit.  None of the current active miners will include a transaction that large into their blocks.  The only way that a transaction that large gets confirmed is if a miner manually builds a block to include that transaction, which has happened on occasion, but it was usually a special circumstance.  If you were to broadcast a 500k transaction today, you have no reasonable assurance that it will be confirmed ever!  All you could do is attach a HUGE fee and hope one of the miners takes the time to craft a custom block just for you.

Sort of like how Debian has a feature freeze a couple of months before a release.
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:49:30
There is another use case that I don't see mentioned anywhere. In the future when block rewards no longer are sufficient to sustain mining and miners are demanding a minimum fee regardless of the block size limit, you may have different miners with different percentages of the network with different minimum fees. RBF allows you to adjust the priority of t
your transaction after the fact. You might be moving coins around between your own wallets and consider it a low priority transaction. Therefore you pay what the cheapest miners are charging and just wait it out but after sending the transaction you realize that their mining percentage has dropped and it might take days before they mine a block. Now you can bump up your fee to get it unstuck. You could even have wallets that can bump up the fee automatically for your convenience after a certain number of blocks pass.
Basically, it allows for a rapidly changing fee market to not have adverse effects on your ability to use the network. (Assuming you are not completing for block space.)
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:07:01
It has to be incompatible by design. They have different triggering thresholds. If they maintained compatibility and they end up with more that 80% of the hash but less than 95%, it would cause a chain fork.  It's a purely logical technical decision.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:21:45


Why is that?  If anything, they are putting themselves in a legally dubious position by not supporting it.  You could make the legal argument that they are withholding your property.  If they still have a withdrawal backlog come Aug 1, I fully expect their to be major class action lawsuits.
If they don't want to support trading of BCC that's their decision, but refusing to let people withdraw it is outright theft, not a political view.

18:12	CodeShark_	We're already getting pushback for the "no philosophy nor politics in the bitcoin-dev mailing list" - this will not work until we've created a functioning bitcoin political philosophy list and can have more of a "we think you'll find more relevant discussion there" attitude rather than a "we don't want you here" attitude
18:13	jgarzik	CodeShark_, don't be overly sensitive. push back is inevitable. the list needs to be productive for productive contributors.
18:13	wumpus	someone else could also create a bitcoin political philosophy list, why would 'we' (whoever that is) have to do everything
18:14	jgarzik	CodeShark_, the two-step plan is sound
18:14	wumpus	what matters for us is a useable development list
18:14	stonecoldpat	i heard there was a bitcoin mailing list that exists already?
18:14	kanzure	jgarzik: fwiw i think your summary of the preivous conversations was less good than your usual summaries. you missed a lot!
18:15	kanzure	CodeShark_: yes i think that's a reasonable approach, but also one quick way around that is to nominate recent threads for inclusion for pre-seeding (or re-play)
18:15	CodeShark_	I've already offered to help create this list, wumpus
18:15	jgarzik	kanzure, That should motivate you to reply with a better summary! :)
18:16	CodeShark_	Moreover, warren had requested bitcoin-discuss from linuxfoundation
18:17	kanzure	jgarzik: hardly; i think you could do better by just linking to the recent conversations in the irc logs instead.
18:17	jgarzik	kanzure, burden of searching is too high. they are poorly organized and annoying to link to
18:18	kanzure	what would make that easier for you/others?
18:18	CodeShark_	jgarzik: it's not about being overly sensitive - it's about keeping everyone happy as best we can so that we can all continue doing what we like to do
18:19	jgarzik	CodeShark_, That is the goal. But like perfection it is unattainable, only approached. My point was that there will always be complaints from somebody; those complaints need to be weighted.
18:20	CodeShark_	moreover, I think bitcoin political philosophy deserves to be discussed...and I think we can accomplish two objectives here
18:21	kanzure	not sure if linuxfoundation will want to host a mailing list that essentially amounts to cypherpunks- but great if they're okay with that
18:21	jgarzik	"already getting pushback" is therefore a bit over-stated. There was one complaint from a non contributor, assuming you exclude hearn's not-really-related reply.
18:21	hearn	how was it not related
18:22	jgarzik	hearn, conflates Bitcoin Core and list admin &amp; policy, and mistakenly paints Wladimir as a leader rather than a collator-of-already-ACKd-PRs
18:22	hearn	i don't even see the issue,really. looking at the recent threads they all appear to be related to proposed protocol changes, libbitcoinconsensus, meetings, BIPs, etc
18:23	hearn	jgarzik: see the issue? i replied pointing out an alternative solution to the problem you see and you already consider my reply to be somewhat offtopic?
18:23	CodeShark_	it comes down to tact :)
18:24	jgarzik	Anybody, even a bot, could execute the Bitcoin Core leadership model. if (have_ACKS) merge else dont. Disagreeing with that philosophy is fine... But it is incorrect to paint or try and saddle Wladimir with "leader of Bitcoin Core" mantle, and then blame Wladimir for some perceived lack of action.
18:24	morcos	Thank you jgarzik
18:24	hearn	jgarzik: that's clearly not the case, and you know it. otherwise BIP101 would be merged already. i'd ack it, gavin would ack it, a few others would - done
18:24	jgarzik	I did one of the Bitcoin Core releases
18:24	kanzure	jgarzik: wladimir has on a number of occassions taken action by not merging something, but this can be perceived as inaction in some cases
18:24	jgarzik	Wladimir is release manager and - god bless him - the main person that manages the morass of github PRs - doing our collective jobs for us
18:25	morcos	hearn are you really unable to translate "(have)
18:25	jgarzik	IMO Wladimir does too much PR'ing and the rest should pitch in
18:25	jgarzik	and free him for real coding
18:25	wumpus	right, list policy has nothing to do with bitcoin core's codebase. Even if I felt like it, I don't have the time to get involved with moderation there.
18:25	morcos	sorry.. "(have_ACKS)" as short hand for "have ACKS and no significant NACKS"
18:25	CodeShark_	of the core committers, I'd say Wladimir is the least political
18:25	maaku	kanzure: I believe warren got some pushback from LF regarding the mailing list split. not sure the details of that though
18:25	hearn	morcos: that's not what jeff just said. with such a rule you suddenly need a definition of "significant" and the job cannot be done by a bot
18:26	hearn	i mean come on. this is absurd.
18:26	wumpus	"has ACKs and doesn't have the entire community in a fight"
18:26	jgarzik	hearn, I understand -- and even agree in some cases -- how inaction translate into a decision or action.
18:26	kanzure	maaku: i still think "direct all the excess mailing list traffic to cypherpunks" is a good plan, heh
18:26	jgarzik	hearn, that has problems
18:26	hearn	maintainership is not automatable. technical management is a skill
18:26	jgarzik	and deserves criticism
18:26	jgarzik	nonetheless, it's not wladimir's fault or responsibility
18:27	hearn	i'm sorry but you cannot have a situation where there is only one implementation, where that implementation has one guy making the decisions, and then expect people to not engage in argument and debate about decisions being made or not made
18:27	jgarzik	hearn, sure
18:27	maaku	hearn: wumpus does not make all the decisions here
18:27	hearn	look at how many block size threads there are. obviously a lot of people believe (rightly or wrongly) that by engaging in discussion they can affect the outcome
18:27	CodeShark_	see why we need a bitcoin political philosophy forum?
18:27	jgarzik	hearn, and that has nothing to do with list admin
18:27	wumpus	anyhow, please get a room for the meta-level discussion, it is off-topic here. This channel is about bitcoin core development and nothing more.
18:27	hearn	if this is not wanted, he can end these threads by saying "I have made a decision, it isn't going to change, further discussion is pointless"
18:28	hearn	people would take the hint
18:28	maaku	hearn: that wouldn't end the discussion
18:28	hearn	it would move it elsewhere
18:28	jgarzik	hearn, list admins were going to be me, btcdrak, and a couple others, don't recall who. the idea is __not__ the same set of bitcoin.git commiters but mix it up.
18:28	CodeShark_	There are many unresolved issues that are not technical...and until they are resolved we'll continue suffering incursions
18:28	maaku	hearn: yeah, it would eject wumpus as lead developer
18:28	hearn	maaku: what would?
18:29	jgarzik	sipa is lead developer :)
18:29	wumpus	then take the hint, and take this away from here
18:29	jgarzik	wumpus is lead merger :)
18:29	maaku	hearn: him throwing his weight around and deciding controversial issues
**I assume the ban happens here**
18:30	jgarzik	wumpus, oh good grief, don't escalate dude
18:30	CodeShark_	boo
18:31	jgarzik	wumpus, just when things had quieted down
18:31	jgarzik	wumpus, Please remove ban.
18:31	wumpus	and stop this personal talk about me.
18:31	jgarzik	wumpus, unavoidable
18:31	CodeShark_	Please remove ban, wumpus
18:35	zooko	sigh
18:37	wumpus	he's welcome back if he just starts talking about development, instead of questioning the project all the time
18:48	jcorgan	well, if his goal was to disrupt the normal goings on in here and bring things to a halt, he succeeded :-(

I don't believe allowing people to withdraw their BCC and supporting BCC are the same thing.  I would consider allowing trading of the coin to be support and if they choose not to do that, that's fine.  Simply allowing people access to the property is their legal obligation. If they stated intent to allow people to withdraw their BCC eventually, but maybe not on day one, I would also find that acceptable.
I just can't see any circumstance where they can't be held legally liable as long as BCC has a non zero value. Especially since my email from Coinbase came in on the 27th. Is 5 days enough advance notice for a corporation to seize your property in the US?

The mathematical proof is that the more hops involved, the more locked coins are required.
This next part of the article is an assumption, but I personally believeo that it's sound logic. He goes on to assume that since each additional hop in the LN routes increase the amount of locked coins required, the network will naturally trend towards a centralize topology with the least amount of hops due to economic incentives.

If Bitcoin became mainstream, how long do you think it will take PayPal/Ebay (or some other company) to start offering a bitcoin escrow service.  Bitcoin has third party arbitration already built in to the protocol.  It's just waiting for someone to step up to the plate, the ability is there already.  I believe that the free market will eventually solve this problem with ease.

I agree with you if you're talking about bitcoin in its current form, however how do you know that the cryptocurrency of the future isn't just a future version release of bitcoin? The problem of 10 minute confirmation times is being somewhat addressed with one of the additions comming in version 0.9.  They're adding the ability for two wallets to comunicate directly with each other for transactions. Let me explain why this allows vendors to accept payments with 0 confirmations. In the current version, the vendor's client just listens to an address and waits for money to show up in it. With direct communication between the wallets, the consumer's wallet can sign the transaction and send it directly to the vendor and let the vendor's client transmit the transaction to the network. That way the vendor's client will know almost immediately if there is already an older transaction on the network with those exact bitcoin and therefore can rest assured that there is no double spend risk.

Is it in your interests for bitcoin to stay small and niche?  That's what would happen if it gets banned outright in the USA.  Just sit back and let them play regulator.  It's not like the regulation will have any real consequence to bitcoin as a whole.  Let them pretend they have some level of control.  Any regulation would be better than the current situation as it is currently prohibitively expensive to run a bitcoin business in the US.  Some of the US based exchanges currently have more lawyers than programmers.  This is a problem and just ignoring the regulations will just compound the issue by making them clamp down even harder.  As a US citizen, I don't want to be required to use some underground darknet to use my bitcoins.  I enjoy the convenience being able to buy and sell bitcoins instantly on Coinbase.  If that's the kind of service that companies that are fully compliant can provide, why on earth would I be against companies complying with regulations?

My proposed solution is different though because it's only triggered in the event of a 55% hash rate loss.

If someone has enough power to cause that type of manipulation, then we have a worse problem then falling hash rate.

Yes, that would happen if this occurred right now, but what about in the future.  Right now bitcoin is used by enthusiasts and early adopters.  What percentage of the market do you think we will be in 10 or 15 years from now?  Lets say the difficulty is 200 times what it is now when we have a hash rate crash?  Without the cooperation of the large ASIC miners, the hash rate we will be able to produce won't even make a dent into saving it.  The ASIC manufactures will care about the good of bitcoin, but we're making a large assumption that a good chunk of the miners will be ran by people who care about the good of bitcoin as we continue into the future.

Yes, but the main difference is when that happened, bitcoin was considered an experiment.  It probably still is.

Sorry if I rambled on a bit there.  I'll try to make my point a bit more concise here.
TL;DR:  If bitcoin starts to gain mainstream success, eventually a large percentage of the miners will be in it for the profit and not for the good of bitcoin.  My fear is a crash in bitcoin's value after achieving general acceptance as a form of payment could cause a crash in hash rate from miners shutting down when the boss sees a drop in profitability.  A crash in hash rate could possibly destroy bitcoin's usefulness as a form of exchange, driving the price down further, killing the currency.  In my post I describe a possible solution to make scaling down difficulty to match a sudden drop in hash rate smother.  If this interests you, then please read my post and share your thoughts.  I feel like this is an obvious flaw in the protocol that was overlooked.  Am I wrong?  If so, please tell me because I'd like to have my worries eased.

@_date: 2013-11-04 16:17:34
Or you could utilize the escrow feature that's already in the protocol.  It seems like no one knows this exists.  You can have 3 party transactions and the transaction will go through when 2 out of 3 parties sign the transaction.  eBay could require the use of such transactions with PayPal as the third party.  The seller signs the transaction when he ships, the buyer signs it when it's received.  If the buyer and seller both sign the transaction, PayPal no longer has any say in the matter; the transaction proceeds.  If the buyer forgets to sign his transaction after receiving the product, PayPal could automatically sign the transaction after a certain amount of time if no dispute is given by the buyer; the transaction proceeds.  If the seller has a complaint or doesn't receive the product, the buyer chooses to not sign the transaction and PayPal will perform the dispute resolution service is it has always done until now.  The transaction will either be stopped or will be send based on PayPal's vote.

You may be missing the fact that the order of operations when reading a web address start at the .com (or what ever other ending) and is read from right to left. The top level domain is .com, the domain is ebay, and the sub domain is blog. Therefore, only someone with access to ebay.com could publish this site without a dns hack. If the site was fake.ebay.com it's real. If it's ebay.fake.com it's fake.
EDIT: I just re-read your comment and wanted to clarify something. It doesn't matter if the blog sub domain is hosted elsewhere because the dns would not resolve the hostname unless it was being redirected from ebay's official server which means that ebay trusts that server. Of course this does not rule out the possibility that whoever controls that sub domain is trying to fool us. If this page is still up in a few hours, it's safe to assume that it's official.

I also can't do any of that stuff with any currency other than the USD. That doesn't make it the only currency in existence. Being able to pay my taxes with it is not the definition of a currency. It doesn't suddenly turn the Euro into funny money.
It would be more accurate to say that Bitcoin is not my local currency. It's no one's local currency, but that doesn't change the definition of currency. As long as it's accepted as a form of exchange, it's by definition a currency.

Yea, I had a trick question on mine too but the answer didn't involve guessing. It wanted to know the name of the bank that currently holds my car loan. My car loan ended a year ago but it listed the name of the bank as one of the choices. I picked none of the above and it worked. If someone was trying to impersonate me and had my information, they probably would have picked the bank, especially since the question was worded as if this loan was still current. It made me feel slightly safer, ironically.

I'm a strong believer in bitcoin.  I'm just fearful of what the US banning it would mean.  I know it won't kill it. The rest of the world would just move on without us like with online gambling.
Also, I don't get your metaphor.  I feel like it proves my point.  If the internet got banned in the USA in the early days, I probably wouldn't have internet access right now and it would have grown a lot slower worldwide.  It would still exist, but it definitely would have been a major blow to the adoption and growth of the internet.
Also I can believe in bitcoin all I want.  That doesn't mean that I believe that a US company in any industry can exist and just ignore US law.  It's the USA i don't believe in, not bitcoin.  Sure bitcoin companies can just operate outside the US and block American ip addresses.  I just don't want to be left behind just because I live in a backwards country that's scared of innovation.

But where is that transaction of stealing my coins stored? In the new blocks.  New blocks can be invalidated by a hard fork if necessary.  It can be, and has been done before. If ECDSA is broken at block 100 they would just hard fork at block 99 and all transactions stored in block 100 and onward, legit and illicit alike, will have never existed.
**EDIT:**  I just thought of something that makes both of our arguments mute.  If the private/public key encryption were to be broken. No amount of changes to the code base could fix it.  If all private keys are suddenly public, then we would have no way of claiming our coins even after a new encryption method is implemented.  How would you prove that you are the legit owner of a wallet on the new fork?  Same goes for the would be thief though.  I could just as easily claim his private keys as my own.  It would result in nothing of value being stolen, just the total collapse of bitcoin.

At first I thought you were just someone with strong beliefs which I can respect. (Notice how I didn't downvote any of your comments.)  Now I know you're just a troll.




I had a business model that was shot down due to the FinCEN guidelines.  The funny thing is it would have dealt almost completely in cryptocurrencies but FinCEN alluded to requiring miners to register as transmitters.  My business plan basically involved providing services in exchange for hashing power.  It even had incentives for those with very little hashing power to turn their miners back on, but since my business plan involved converting my BTC into fiat so I could pay the bills, apparently that makes me a money transmitter.  So yes, I do feel persecuted.

If this is truly the reason, then this is great news for the stability of bitcoin as a whole.  Up until recently MtGox commanded the market value of bitcoin.  It was almost a single point of failure that could possibly cause the value of bitcoin to crash hard.  If stuff happening at Coinbase is causing moves in the value of bitcoin, then we are well on our way to breaking away from MtGox's hold on the market.  Diversification is key to sustainability, especially if MtGox were to get shut down one day.

It definitely took a massive hit, but I'm not so sure about it being lasting.  Another black market will pop up soon enough.  However, it would be fair to say that current demand/price for BTC is currently propped up by the speculators more than it was two days ago.  I bought in on the dip and scooped up some coins at $93.

Since you're in the USA, use Coinbase for your end. They have a 4-7 day delay on transactions for your first month, but 30 days after your first transaction, you can upgrade to instant transactions by verifying your ID.

The thing is even if everything you predicted comes to fruition, loans will still exist and they will still have their place. For example, you can't expect a med school student to be able to pay for their education up front. Also, what about someone who wants a loan to start a business. Even if we become more thrifty as a society, all that affect is the credit card industry. Loans will always be a thing for the foreseeable future.

I'm going to just repost something I said about a month ago because it seems relevant.
"This headline got me thinking. How could a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin work across vast distances of space? Imagine we have a colony on Mars. Radio communication in one direction will take between 4 min 18 sec minimum and 21 minutes maximum, depending on where Earth and Mars are in their relative orbits. If data packets require 2-way communication, double those times. Unless we discover a way to communicate faster than the speed of light, current cryptocurrencies would be unfeasible on an inter-planetary scale. We would need a system that can still function with a possible ping time of 42 minutes, assuming the packed isn't dropped. One possible solution is to have a separate EarthCoin and MarsCoin. This isn't ideal because it sort of kills the benefit of using crypto currencies for inter-planetary transactions. Imagine MtGox handling all interplanetary transactions, lol. Another solution would be to develop a single cryptocurrency that can handle multiple blockchains. A separate blockchain for each planet/colony. Each separate block chain will try to sync with the others every "X" number of blocks discovered. That way transactions within the planet/colony could be quick as they are currently and transactions where coins move into a different block chain can have longer verification times without slowing down the entire system. An advantage of using a single currency with multiple blockchains is that all the coins would be price locked to each other because they are the same coins. That would serve to reduce inter-planetary blockchain spam from people trying to make a quick buck on exchange rates."

Really, it depends on how much debt we're talking about.  If he was a med school student, is debt could have easily been well over $100,000.

Historically, bitcoin goes through boom and bust cycles.  It's not a safe bet, but you can reasonably assume that it will recover eventually.  However, that could be several months away.  If you need the money now for something, then it will most likely not recover in time for your needs.  The number one thing to remember about bitcoin is it's very unpredictable.  All analysis is based on historical past performance.  This is not the most accurate way to predict the future.  Look up charts of the 2011 bubble and the 2013 April bubble and make a decision for yourself.

I don't understand why people say this.  XRP is no more a currency than letter stamps are currency.  Personally, I believe bitcoin is the superior form of exchange but what people forget is that ripple predates bitcoin.  The XRP part of it is nothing more than an anti spam measure.  Ripple was never attempting to create a virtual currency.  XRP is not the unit of exchange on the ripple system!  Ripple is a semi-decentralised attempt at a digital exchange that was built to solve a problem before bitcoin existed.
That said, it's not a completely decentralised system and one company holds a majority of the stamps, giving them almost full control.  It also requires many independent, but trusted servers.  I agree with you that ripple should be avoided.  I just don't like it when people repeat the same nonsense.  There are plenty of reasons not to use ripple without the need to spread FUD.  Ripple should be avoided because it's outdated by bitcoin, not because it's a scam.

Rooting your phone does introduce new security holes, but it also reduces others and probably more beneficial than negative by making you a smaller target.  Here's an example.  Right now Samsung is the largest Android manufacture by a large margin.  Samsung makes changes to their implementation of Android, most of which are closed source.  Closed source code is an easier target for exploits than open source because more eyes are on the code and security holes will be closed at a faster pace.  There have been Samsung specific Android exploits in the past.  I believe it had something to do with a QR code backdoor that would go to a website and execute a command immediately if I remember correctly.  A rooted phone can run a completely opensource implementation such as Cyanogenmod.  There's also this nasty piece of spyware that comes preinstalled on most phones called Carrier IQ.  See   The very first thing I did when I bought my new phone was root it just so I could blow away the files that run Carrier IQ.

They wouldn't be able to make changes to older blocks on the blockchain.  A hard fork of the blockchain from before the exploit was used would definitely work, although that would mean that all transactions between the exploit being used and the update being released would be lost.  Not a great outcome admittedly, but it's not the end of bitcoin as you describe and it's already happened once where 40 something blocks were deleted off the blockchain by a hard fork.

People selling stuff on Ebay.  Most people are completely unaware of PayPal's reputation.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:54:51
I think it depends entirely on how it is implemented.  If they use the 3rd party escrow function that's built into the bitcoin protocol, then I'll be fine with it.  If PayPal wants to hold bitcoins as a third party, then that's not ok.  The difference is if party A and party B have a transaction with PayPal as a 3rd party and party A and B agree that all is good, then the transaction goes through and is irreversible and PayPal doesn't get a say in the matter.  PayPal only has any control when party A and party B disagree, in which case it casts the tie breaking vote.
Also, another thing to remember is eBay owns PayPal, not the other way around.  There could be a significant market demand to allow eBay act as an exchange for bitcoins if they changed their policies about refunding scammers trying to fake out the system.  Think about all the money they could make if eBay announced crypto currency exchange services that could be funded with fiat through PayPal.  Their not blind to the obvious market opportunities.
