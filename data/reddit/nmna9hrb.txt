Out of curiosity, do you run an adblocker?

Well, I don't necessarily agree with this tactic 100%, but I do think it's silly to regulate it. 
If you visited websites who told you up front this was happening, or even offered it as an opt-in option.. I don't see it being very deceitful. Even if they were shady about it, there's a lot more deceitful things on the internet that people have either found ways to block or shame, or somehow otherwise protect themselves and others without the government's intervention.
An ad blocker could probably even block this type of thing.
As for the efficiency... ads aren't terribly efficient either. Quite frankly most visitors have to see them for the small fraction of those who actually click them. As long as this doesn't end up costing viewers a fortune in power.. it's not literally Hitler. It helps, even if only a small fraction of the time. And I'm sure there's ways to make this more efficient.

You don't have to do anything, I was just curious. I had a hunch you would oppose advertising as a means of recouping money it costs to provide services on the web.. and surprise surprise, you do.
People generally undervalue the work it takes and money it costs to keep websites running, many even feeling entitled to certain things.
A great many websites allow to you pay to disable ads. Are you suggesting the people who cannot pay should simply have restricted access to information?
Do you pay for Reddit gold to not see ads, or disable your ad blocker on Reddit? You seem to spend a fair amount of time here.
