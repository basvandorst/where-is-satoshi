I'm aware this is FUD, but that doesn't mean the price drop isn't real. Let's assume the btc value keeps dipping it would be just dumb to wait for that.
Sell high, buy at the dip. 
The problem is, nobody can predict the market, is this the dip? Are we recovering? Right now yes, but 8 hours in btc time is like a year. I'm freaking out, honestly, anxiety disorders are not cool when you're investing all your money in a high risk/high profit market like this one.

I don't know, it's a bet. What i'm thinking is, i got 17.749,01 US$ at this current moment. Worst case scenario, i sell, i buy tomorrow and i lose a fraction (maybe a big fraction, god help me) of btc. Best case scenario i buy more than 1 btc. In either case, i got my 17.749,01 US$. If i don't sell, i could wake up tomorrow with less than 10k, who knows. I'm honestly worried.

So why wasting your time on this sub? You're done with BTC. 
I'd say you hope to see a deeper dip, to buy again and make more money. But maybe i'm wrong and you're just bored. Just saying

don't be harsh bro, we're on the same side. there's an italian proverb: "He who sleeps doesn't catch any fish", and that's exactly what i'm gonna do now lol

To you, sure. It would be bad for you if BTC grows right after you cashed out, innit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:23
So, BTC is -5,9%, BCH is -16,3%
What's happening? Panic selling everybody? Some other explanation?
Bitcoin is here to stay. You played your little games with the altcoins, now come back to your mother. Let's get rich everybody. Keep this place positive. WE are the market. 
Bitcoin is going to grow again, the question is how fast? That depends on you. Don't be a pussy.

sadly it was not the dip
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:40
All the ancap are wealthy, how is that? :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:44
thx for the advice
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:48:55
I bought mine on Bitstamp actually. Then moved to coinbase for the fork that never happened, and now i'm trying to move back.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:51
And that's the right thing to do if you can watch - I'M NOT ADVISING ANYONE TO SELL, DO NOT SELL - but i have to work tomorrow and i seriously need to sleep, i cannot watch, that's exactly the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:56
That's a bit encouraging, thanks. Let's hope the recover doesn't take so long.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:23:09
I could, thanks. Soon as they give my money back. If they do.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:30:42
Greedy? Depressing? Am i doing any damage to the market with these kind of messages? Am i stealing from someone?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:46:53
The only thing you're disrupting is your credibility. But keep trolling if that pleases you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:57:17
That's exactly what i told a friend of mine 1 hour ago, who linked me some dumb news about "bitcoin does not exist". I agree on every single word, i'm not losing faith in bitcoin. As i said, i would buy again even if i sell now, it's just a temporary measure (maybe, i'm trying to understand what's best *right now*.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:08:02
The thing is... you can use the search bar a hundred times, but when you invested thousands of euros and you fear that doing something wrong could turn them into nothing you're never too sure. I know it's annoying to you, but it's extremely important to me, try to undertand, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:04:27
Please don't be mean. I did that, for like a month, i just don't understand. People just say "keep your private keys", but what do i have to do with them?
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:00:58
Thanks but.... how do i exactly get the coins? It's confusing. Do they appear in the same wallet automatically? With another name?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:19:13
I read somewhere that is risky to move coins right after the fork. I don't know why and i don't know if that's true. What's really conveniente? That's what i'm trying to understand
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:17:18
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:05:05
Oh! Thanks man, this is very precious
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:50:30
Ok, so i got nothing and bitcoin is still dipping (??)
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:55:12
doesn't look good...
did you receive the altcoin yet?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:03:24
Ok thank you guys, let's see what happens next :)
