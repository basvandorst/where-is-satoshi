Well, I'd say only demand and market make any price. FIAT, bitcoin, any good, everything. With bitcoin, I'd assume the biggest influence to be speculation on the developement of it.  Just like housing nowadays. Prices go up because people have enough (or too much) of fluid money, so they buy expensive flats and houses. For example in Munich.
The govt wants taxes in FIAT? But taxes are only a fraction of demand. Most is the goods you want to buy with it. If both, FIAT and bitcoin are stable, it won't be a problem to change some bitcoin into FIAT to pay the taxes.
Actually noone needs money. Can't eat money. Can't shelter in money. What we need is the things we buy with it. If you can have your tomatoes for bitcoin - that's what they are worth. Same for FIAT and same in a inflation. Taxes are only a fraction we spend for some public services. Like water supply. And the people we need to hire to bring it to us (let it be efficient or not).

I'd like to modify this into:
*Just like how the value of your paper money is not in the paper itself   
but in **people and shops who give goods** for this paper, the value of   
Bitcoin is not in the tokens used to exchange with each other, but in   
the **people and shops which accept it as a payment** (or exchange it to other forms of payment)*

Thanks for mentioning a real shop. So far my main shop is rented and I hdidn't find a modern replacement jet.  
I have 2 more shops which are woocommerce - so, I'll take a look at Nomiddleman. For Woocommerce I saw solutions the others mentioned too.  
However, I don't really like the architecture of Woocommerce shops. ATM the only viable solution though.
I think I can start with one of the woo-shops.

Mabe someone wanted to influence the bitcoin price, maybe someone urgently needed the USD. Like this article suggests:

Right, of course you wouldn't be able to buy *all* bitcoin for the current price of one. 
$41 bn isn't that much compared to other assets ( [link]( ) It's just one Larry Page. And he is just one of many billionaires ("By our latest count there are 2,153 billionaires").  I suppose, that's the reason why a sell of 1.2 bn had such an impact.

OK, sold makes sense, not transfer.
So someone sold bitcoin for $1.2 bn USD? What would they buy with this money? Was anything going up?
And that 1.2 bn made bitcoin drop more than 15%. I suppose the price for \*all\* bitcoins in existence is very much higher than 10fold  that?
edit: I looked it up and found $41 bn for all bitcoins in existence.

Or: The traditional currencies are relatively volatile to the bitcoin.
