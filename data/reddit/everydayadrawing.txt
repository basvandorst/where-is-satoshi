If he was doing that it would be pretty retarded. Spending millions doing televison ads with a small btn mention at the bottom in a sneaky plan to manipulate the price of the entire bitcoin market so he can quickly sell everything he has at just the right time to make $$$ ...
He'd be smarter to just put everything he has on Red and cross his fingers.
Or cash out the BTC he has now. The price is huge already compared to one year ago.

Bitcoin went up just as fast. People don't seem to freak out when their 'investment' goes up hugely in a short period.
Timing the market isn't really possible without some serious insider knowledge that nobody else possesses. If you could do that then you could just become a multimillionaire easily.

But who could invest in bitcoin not knowing it has a history of highly volatile ups and downs? That's why I said in my OP that any time you're "freaking out" about it going down or up significantly is evidence you invested too much AND didn't know what you were investing in.

You shouldn't invest amounts that will cause you to 'freak out' if the investment goes down. Thinking you can avoid that possiblity makes you irrational. You think you're smarter than the combined wisdom of tens of thousands of geeks around the world setting the current price? If you knew FOR SURE it would go up that would make you god and you might as well just put everything you own into bitcoin and never sell because it's always going up forever!!!
Too many people buying bitcoin don't understand concepts like expected value. Play some poker and invest an amount that will not cause you to 'freak out' regardless of what happens.

Advocating not hitting children is creepy?

Although I agree that his forum has a weird vibe I give him a pass because I find his videos some of the most interesting on the Internet. I recommned to people they look over his youtube channel as there's lots of gold there but go to other forums for their libertarian discussion as his are definitely a bit odd.
Never heard of that bitcoin fuckup though... wow. that's a shame!
