No no, I think you're getting confused, being a sovereign nation is the opposite of being controlled.
Maybe it will, maybe it won't. It would for sure be better for the UK on anything but the shortest timescale.
Between you and me I have more money than I know what to do with and property in the EU and the UK, I'm hedged to fuck and ready to break out the popcorn.

"In 1992 - the highwater mark for participation in recent general elections - a total of 33,614,074 people went to the ballot box - 72.3 per cent. Thursday's referendum narrowly missed beating that record."
That 37% of the electorate became 53% of the voters.
Remind me what % of the electorate voted to remain... Less than 37% that's for sure.
To suggest that it isn't valid because some people couldn't be bothered to vote is ridiculously disingenuous.
You *really* must try harder.

Ruining my dream, LOL.  
TBH I couldn't care less either way, as someone married to a European, that spends half my time in the EU, my life would probably be easier if the UK stayed in the EU.
However,  I believe in the value of democracy, and have something called integrity; I doubt you even understand the meaning of the word.

For a little while, but  in the end (grand scheme) they can't win, and they know it, that's why they aren't trying.  Every day BTC is becoming more enshrined in regulation and mainstream life, seems a country doing away with tax on crypto in some respect is becoming almost a weekly occurrence now. The trend will continue.
I've been holding since 2012, I remember the days when countries tried to restrict, those days are long gone now.
bitcoin is going to fundamentally change our concept of government.
No coiners are always gonna try and rationalize away their regret I guess.

Sure, but my point is that I'd be surprised if we didn't go much higher than before just due to the fact there is institutional investment coming, thus it seems wrong to me to say the odds are not in our favor, when they clearly are IMO. Fiat values will become less and less meaningful as the financial meltdown continues, but that's another matter.
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:32:29
To be fair, we got to 19k last ATH, and that was mostly retail. So it would be surprising if we didn't at least double that IMO.

You're just a concern troll salty no coiner.
I don't need to convince you, you're free to be poor if you want to.
I was right 2012 and I'm right now.
That bitcoin is the best performing asset in human history is no ones belief or opinion, its objective fact.
Cope harder.
(Bitcoin’s compounded annual growth rate is 235% over almost a decade. 
Literally 10 times the annual compounding rate of Warren buffets’ Berkshire Hathaway over the same period.
Even from 2014 until now, the CAGR has been above 78%. 
The CAGR of Apple in the past five years is 7.9%)

It's exactly the point of bitcoin, a decentralized, censorship resistant immutable ledger. 
Cope with it however you like man. Tell yourself that crypto can't succeed if that makes you feel better.

@_date: 2019-09-14 12:01:45
There isn't "the government", there are hundreds of them around the world, I can assure you they aren't all going to ban bitcoin. Quite the opposite in fact, there has never been so much acceptance.
Even if there was an attempt at a coordinated ban (the very thought of which is hilarious) it still would be no match for bitcoin.
Could they hurt the price and set it back a couple of years? Probably, but in the grand scheme of bitcoin it literally makes zero difference. 
If you think governments can stop bitcoin then you simply don't understand bitcoin.
Edit: LOL downvote all you like, but I'll still be right and you'll still be wrong.
