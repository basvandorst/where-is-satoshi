Sorry, relative noob here. Not a Comp Sci major and would greatly appreciate an ELI5. 
From a user's perspective, why is BitGo safer than Coinbase+2FA when I use a malware-infected system? (Assuming that I don't have a problem with client-side wallets. )
If a hacker can break my Coinbase 2FA, I am hosed. Similarly, if hacker breaks my BitGo 2FA, The service would have no way of knowing that and still validate that transaction. In either case, I still lose.

Ok. Thanks for all your responses. 
I guess I just had higher expectations from multisig than merely bumping against some arbitrary "high" limit. 
Is there a smarter multisig solution out there? Is a smarter solution even mathematically possible. (I acknowledge that 2FA has to be defeated for all this to be relevant.)
Thanks again.

Ya, sorry. I was just posting the same link.

I don't use the service, just really interested. 
My understanding described above is gathered after I read their whole white paper 3 times:
Refer to the paragraph titled: "Withdrawing Funds from the 2-of-3 Address"
Maybe I am just 2 stupid to understand it. 
If you think I am wrong, please do let me know. Thanks!

Do you think that the low liquidity/market cap is a problem for investment money to flow into Bitcoin. (May not be easy to invest $100M or more without significantly affecting price; will need several sellers to be in market). Is this an issue at all? Recently, a bank CEO made remarks to such effect.

Thanks. I understand that multisig, when implemented correctly, is safer. 
However, my question is specifically regarding BitGo multisig implementation. 
Apparently they simply validate any spend transaction (within pre specified transaction limits) initiated by the customer after passing 2FA. Doesn't that mean that all the hacker needs is the first key? The second key is always obtained automatically. How is that adding any value?
