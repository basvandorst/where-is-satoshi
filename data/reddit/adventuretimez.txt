If only there was a place where people could freely post reviews and warn others of an illegitimate business with a couple clicks and pushing some buttons...  hmm... maybe one day
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:54:56
But it will be fixed. There is A LOT of money to be made by making bitcoin's "killer app"
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:09:26
During the depression they were low, of course. I said leading up to it. I never said I was positive on that though, so why are you being such an ass?
Edit: Just looked it up and in 1920 the united states saw an inflation rate of 15.72%
@_date: 2015-04-03 09:30:57
Ever heard of inflation?

AFAIK, laundering doesnt have to be to hide illegal funds, thats just a large part of what its used for
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:57:21
Umm what? Thats not the only way for price to reach 10k... I dont see what the point you are making is
Edit: didnt read your comment all the way through so this comment doesnt make total sense
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:38:12


Yes. 
But mostly buying power lower than ever. I would think there was huge inflation leading up to the great depression and at other times, so im not sure if the inflation we are experiencing tops that.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:07:43
Its harder right now yes, but before bitcoin is adopted by the masses, there will be an app that makes bitcoin just as easy to use as credit cards
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:31:05
Crypto can be very very secure though. All you would need is a treaty with one other country and have the person who knows the password seed reside there or set up something like an embassy there. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:41:14
By the year 2140, bitcoin's inflation will reach 0. 
And of course bitcoin is volatile now, it's still in its infancy. But bitcoin is becoming more and more stable
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:21:44
Every fiat currency that is no longer used right now has become worthless. The only thing that maintains value after a collapse is gold, silver, BTC, etc.

Copying allows you access to the content, but it doesn't take the content away from anyone else. So yes, copying is not stealing.

What is so hard about 2FA?
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:42:08
How much bitcoin was available? Because when ive used them I had immediate access to 100$ worth of bitcoin immediately and then a few days for the rest
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:52:26
Not if its safely stored in crypto
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:14:50
Yes I believe it would require a hard fork. It hasnt been changed yet because there is no need right now. Transactions rarely take longer than 45 minutes for confirmation, which really isnt too big of an issue. If more people start using bitcoin (mainstream adoption), then im sure it will be changed
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:54:12
Ok.... then if the need is there then a startup will arrive that charges a percentage of the transaction to allow for security in those cases. Or y'know, people could double check before they send bitcoin. The irreversability of bitcoin is a feature, not a drawback.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:39:30
Of course its hard to prove it, and I dont have the time or resources to do so. Im basing it on the huge increase in cost of everything when bought with USD
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:09:04
The 51% attack is a myth. There is nothing special about getting more than 50%. You cant do anything with 51% that you cant do with 49%
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:51:16
It doesnt have to be bitcoin or credit cards, they can in fact coexist. I use credit cards for the cash back for most purchases, but if I need to send money to someone in Africa or China in a time-sensitive manner? You better know bitcoin is better than credit cards in that case
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:08:15
And? That will be possible 20 or 30 years down the road. Right now we don't need that high of TPS so it wont be changed until need be
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:41:28
Hmm, looks like you are right. Though It seems like that page is more focused on the legal definition, rather than what money laundering truly means. You absolutely can launder money legally, but there really isn't any point to it unless it is to hide criminal activity or avoid taxes
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:44:50
If you disagree with me, comment why rather than downvoting. I have a feeling that a lot of the downvotes I am receiving are bitcoin trolls.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:49:12
I personally, believe that inflation is theft. However, I will concede that many people believe it to be necessary for a "healthy" economy.
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:29:54
Looks like he is another bitcoin troll. I looked through his history and all of his posts in r/bitcoin are bashing bitcoin with very little evidential support.
@_date: 2015-04-25 07:42:07
Look up bitcoin's market cap. If you arent basing it on market cap, what else are you to use?

Oh I know exit scams happen, I was just talking specifically about evolution though. All those scams teach people is DO NOT TRUST third party organizations with your bitcoin. Laws that are in place right now will cover people when they use bitcoin with legitimate businesses, though.

Almost all gambling websites wouldn't reuse addresses, at least not the reputable ones. Most of what Coinbase does is because of the AML and KYC laws forced upon them by the federal gov't

How so?
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:06:07
Its not a hard change... I dont have the computer skills to write the code for it but im sure there are capable programmers who could.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:42:48


Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:05:17
Thats not the point though. And there already has been, its called venmo. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:40:42
Thats why hardforks are done only when truly necessary. And that example is with dogecoin, not bitcoin

I didnt mean they have value just because he had to buy them... his daughter can turn around and buy something with it or sell them for fiat
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:54:09
Ahh yes, I totally agree about the downvoting thing, but no one else on this subreddit respects that so why should I? Bitcoin's inflation rate is halved every few years until it reaches 0. So it's a nearly perfect system. Other altcoins have tried to make something "better than bitcoin", but none have really gained traction for a reason
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:55:52


Sure, makes sense. And just a heads up, I didn't downvote your comment, other people did.


Over-inflation is always bad. It is a hidden tax on people who want to save their money.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:52:39
So that when I work for 30 years to save up for retirement, the money I have earned holds the same buying power as it did when I earned it
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:06:00
Its probably not that high but it is very possible. With bitcoin, you cannot create more than the maximum 21 million coins
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:09:24
Evolution was an illegal drug market, how much security do you think people who used it expected?

@_date: 2015-04-22 23:29:53
5%+. And before you say that current inflation rates are 3%, ill let let you know that I am almost positive that those are not the real rates. Have you looked at the cost of food and everything else? The value of the dollar is decreasing faster than it ever has been
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:32:03


If the USD were to lose 50% of its value tomorrow, bitcoin would be unaffected. Actually, it would probably increase in value compared to the USD. Since it is decentralized, no entity, including the government, could take it down.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:40:28
Sure, but I don't believe that the 3% inflation rate is accurate. Of course, I have no way to prove this and trying to convince you would likely be futile, but the USD is losing purchasing power very quickly, especially in the last 5-8 years since the turn of the economy. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:13:45

Glad to see the troll army is out again. Not basing it on your differing opinion like y'all always point out when you're called out for trolling, but rather your post history. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:08:56
Ahh gotcha. I just looked it up and interest rate gets up to around 3.3% for the top tier. Thats close, but still under the true rate of inflation

Hello from the netherlands!
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:18:40
Decentralized, has a public ledger, doesn't rely on the USD which can have very high inflation rates, send money anywhere in the world for a very low cost, and more. I can continue if you would like but I think you should get the point.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:08:57
And there will be inflation in bitcoin up until 2140, if at that point the need to inflate bitcoins becomes evident, then it can be changed. The beauty of open source software
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:59:32
Actually I looked up 1920s inflation and the first number to.come up was 1920 which had 15% inflation. But to be honest, I couldnt care less what you think of me and am done commenting. Dont be such an ass if you want to have a discussion.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:07:43
Ok, fair point. Then just change credit cards to cash and its the same issue
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:05:26
Then you have not lost. You still have the same number of BTC right?
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:29:02
A corporatist? Hes trying to get money out of politics, instead of trying to raise 2.5 billion $ on his campaign like hillary is
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:00:07
That is true. I have yet to see a problem with bitcoin that cannot be fixed in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:30:27
Damn... 9.8% is nice. Cant get that anywhere in the US of A
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:15:17
Hmm? Im curious and asking a legitimate question
Edit: 
Ooh I see what you're saying. You had a bunch of bitcoin trolls come and downvote me. Great. These magic internet points mean nothing to me and just downvoting anything that is against your belief doesnt change the fact that the world is changing. Hop on the train or be left behind, I couldnt care less.
Edit 2: Looking through your profile I can confidently say that you are a troll and im nearly positive that the other accounts arguing with me are your alt accounts or troll-friends.
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:01:40

If you are not gaining the equivalent of the inflationary rate, you are in fact losing money.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:09:39
If that was a regulated deal where we had a contract written up I would jump on it. But mt gox and a number of other scams has shown that you shouldnt trust people with your bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:57:14
And why would I hate people bringing up precious metals? I would rather have an oz of gold than the equivalent in USD, so long as I didnt need to use it for immediate transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:47:50
Im sorry, what is the point you are making?
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:10:19
So why is it so obvious to you? Besides trusting everything the government tells you. Im genuinely curious because you seem so confident that its true
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:43:55
The 3 TPS limit can be changed when the need arises
@_date: 2015-04-25 07:48:22
HAHAHAHA. You want stability and no hardforks and yet you also want constant updates? Cmon man, if youre gonna troll dont make it so obvious.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:13:54

@_date: 2015-04-25 17:01:54
I understand that technically the market cap may or may not have been invested in it. But each coin holds the value of about 230$ right now. If more people buy it then sell, price goes up. And vice versa. Again I'll ask you, if you aren't using market cap, what else would you use?
@_date: 2015-04-03 05:40:02
I seriously hope people don't put money into Mineral... it's just going to make Bitcoin look worse in the public's eye.

@_date: 2015-04-06 16:55:47
I never said its 100% guaranteed but it doesnt rely on the faith of the united states government to have value. So logically, it would make sense that BTC would maintain value
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:03:36
How is it dumb? It is 100% factual
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:01:18
Well the "official" inflation rate is 3%, and I would be very shocked if that was true
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:33:13
In the current market, yes, its a gamble. Remember, bitcoin is still in its infancy. Once there is mainatream adoption, volatility will be greatly decreased.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:39:18




The first two points you made are a user-end erro, not a problem with bitcoin.


This is called fraud, and no legitimate business would last long doing such things.


You pay within seconds of ordering with bitcoin so the price change can be negligible unless there is EXTREME volatility. And when there is extreme volatility, people arent spending bitcoin as much.
I'm all ears. I'm not trying to start a confrontation, im genuinely curious about the "flaws" of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:53:50
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:06:43
Well then thats a coinbase problem. Coinbase is not bitcoin, and when you trust third parties with your bitcoin, you run into issues such as the one you have pointed out
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:47:42
Worldwide declining interest in bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-03-05 05:48:42
This is the second to last time that it will happen. 1xx,xxx bitcoins were seized from the owner of silk road after he faced many charges in the US. Now they have been auctioned off in portions at these auctions. However,  the bitcoins are lumped into blocks of 2000 or 3000 BTC at these auctions so it is much more likely to be bought by some exchange company or other group with large capital rather than an individual.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:07:31
Well hopefully you can make some of that back but I dont see you making the .8 BTC back. Especially as difficulty increases
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:19:25
Already, there are services like microwallet and faucetbox that receive several microtransactions and then payout once a certain threshold is hit. This reduces fees paid and makes microtransactions practical.

I'm guessing that the people who use your service don't know much about bitcoin. Maybe you can throw a YouTube video up on your site explaining it? You can't expect a whole lot of people to switch to bitcoin if they haven't already used it, but it could help.

Actually they already have that. If you click on the transaction it tells you the price and amount of bitcoin it was "worth" (circle's price)
Also, circle is an exchange, not a wallet
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:19:42
Because at that point the dollar is worth nothing. Bitcoin however, would be unaffected or possibly rise as people want a way to store their money rather than the dollar
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:53:37
Ahaha thats a good one ive never heard before
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:52:00
Na, that's really know what the OP was saying. Sure, coinbase and circle are an ok solution right now, but I'm sure in 2 years there will be much better exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:37:10
That only shows that search results are less than during the mtgox hay day. Does that surprise you though? Just as the price is doing, it is stabilizing after debatably unwarranted hype.
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:23:47
So you dont explain how to acquire the bitcoin and on top of that you are using an exchange as a wallet. Interesting.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:00:55
Darkcoin, bitcoindark, and I'm sure others have utility too.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:53:10
