I'm not that guy, but you seem to be knowledgeable. I don't really understand channel capacity.  It seems rather inflexible.
Suppose the network is A B C on a line where the AB channel has 1BTC commitments from each, and the BC channel has 2BTC commitments from each. What happens if C wants to pay A 2 BTC? Does B have to close the channel and open it up again with a &gt;2BTC commitment? 
I guess what I'm getting at is, it seems like for two parties to exchange k BTC, there must be a path between them where the direction channel capacity is at least k on each edge.
Also, how would A get B to commit 1BTC in the first place? That would be 1 less BTC that could be used in B's other channels, if I understand correctly. If A decided to keep their funds in the LN network instead of a regular wallet, and doesn't spend or receive coins, it's just a waste of opportunity cost for B's 1BTC commitment.

Are you asking why you should trust intermediate nodes? The system is trustless by design. As long as your private key doesn't get leaked, your money can be redeemed. The hubs don't have the power to lock you out of your money.

A) NP doesn't mean "not polynomial", it means non-deterministic polynomial time. This just means a solution can be verified in polynomial time. Everything that belongs to P (deterministic polynomial time) also belongs to NP.
B) I think you mean NP-hard, (well technically FNP-hard but that's another story) which ~means as hard as all the problems in NP, but again, that doesn't mean "not polynomial time".
C) If P = NP, then the NP-complete members of NP-hard would be in P, making them solvable in polynomial time. Even if P != NP, it's possible for NP-complete problems to have arbitrarily close approximate solutions  found in polynomial time.
D) Figuring out if a route exists and if there is enough capacity is pretty easy (ST-CONN, MAX FLOW).

wdym? The benefits for the end user is lower fees and faster confirmations. Currently Bitcoin is unusable as payment for anything remotely inexpensive ($30+ fees). This could drop fee's back into the cent range. Once you set up your node, txns will work in the same way, put the amount and address into whatever app you're using and it's done. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:03:43


But B is the node end user A connected to. A is basically SoL, and should find a new hub to connect to?


How would an end user go about setting up a connection that they intend to be paid from? Like if A is Starbucks, they could operate their own nodes, but if I'm like some guy on the internet maybe taking donations or selling stuff, what do I do? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:09:39
It would probably still be a heavy tailed distribution, with the top k% holding the lion's share of connections.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:58:53
You only need to pay those fees when opening and closing a channel.  This is how things are today. If you buy 1 BTC on an exchange, you pay the fee once to send to a hot wallet, and the fee again if you ever want to defund that wallet. If you want to keep your money on the exchange, they could just "withdraw" from their lightening node, saving them money.
What do you mean by user experience? A lightening wallet app could operate the exact same way as a normal wallet app, and hide all of the confusion under the hood. The only caveat is that lightening payments would be limited to lightening network participants, which invariably would be 99% of businesses that use bitcoin upon widescale adoption.

I don't see why the amount of bitcoins measured in units of bitcoin is relevant.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:55:38
Minus the raise part, OP was technically correct. Suppose bitcoin was at $20k and got the 5% returns week over week. There exists a weekly withdraw strategy that nets you 52k income and leaves your account at $20k at the end of the year. The problem is that pattern of withdraws could easily be $0 for the first 7 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:59
Not really. I suppose if you were an emotionless machine it could be this way, but most people can't help but think of unrealized gains as wealth they own, because it pretty much is for a rational investor. And besides, I'm pretty sure if you bought at 100 BTC as $0.10, a 50% drop is gonna sting way harder than losing $5.

Replace "USD" with "world money supply" and then that makes no sense. If the world switched to only using bitcoin, the market cap of bitcoin would just be the money supply, because owning bitcoin doesn't offer any value other than it's use as currency in such a world. 
To your credit this sum could be very large
- Take the US per person cash supply (~$10k cash/bank accounts)
- Multiply by expected population of 2060 (10 billion), to get 100 trillion today's dollars as total circulating currency in 2060
- Divide by 17 million to get $5.88M 2017 dollars as the value of 1 BTC in 2060
- Divide by a 43 year inflation adjusted discount rate (1.05^43 ~8.15) to get ~720,000k, the amount of money you would need today to have $5.88M in in 2060 inflation adjusted.
1 Bitcoin would be worth $720k today even if it had total worldwide adoption in 2060 and world wealth levels mirrored the US. That's a huge moon, but people who think 1BTC could surpass $1M anytime soon are delusional.

Gold is useful for society not just as a thousands of years old aesthetic commodity, but also is used by variety of industries for it's physical properties. Gold may fluctuate due to supply side changes and other market forces, but it will never drop to 0 unless something unbelievable happened like we found a gigantic easy access mine or discovered gold irreversibly will seep into world water supplies causing autism.

The thing is you're "not even wrong", because you think bitcoin is a savings vehicle, and fiat = cycle of debt.

Here is an example:
Say there are two exchanges A and B. Because the exchanges are different marketplaces (you can't sell from A to a person buying in B), they might have different prices. You could consider buying BTC at the cheaper market, and selling at the higher market for a profit, but the transfer between sales takes 30min possibly hours, and what if the price drops at the expensive market? Instead, this is how you can effectively make the trade with 0 second delay:
- BTC at A trades for $12,000
- BTC at B trades for $10,000
- You start off with 1 BTC in A/$10,000 in B
- Trade in both exchanges at the same time
- send the BTC back to A, and USD back to B (takes hours for BTC, days for USD)
- You now have 1 BTC in A and $12,000 in B, which is $2,000 profit
- rinse and repeat if the opportunity still exists
The actual math to 100% guarantee both your BTC and USD have increased is slightly more tedious when factoring in fees, but it's possible to set this up so that both your USD and BTC increase by the same percentage. This makes it impossible to lose money, regardless of price changes.
There are a couple of caveats:
- This method requires 2x the money compared to buy low/sell high for the same profit, and 1x more per additional exchange you add into the mix. 
- The initial purchase of 1 BTC exposes you to risk. If you started off with $20k and did this, but BTC dropped to $5k, you'd be at $12k + $5k of BTC = $17k.  This is very important to note. While the trade itself was risk free, the process of trading is never risk free. Anytime you hold a non cash asset, you're exposing yourself to some level of risk.
- Traders (and their bots) are well aware of arbitrage, and will keep the prices between exchanges consistent within minutes or seconds of a price difference. Also fee's can make this not worth it for small trades. Therefore you probably will need a large amount of capital (like dozens of BTC at least) and a program to execute the trades for you.
- Somethings are too good to be true. There is a reason why the prices for BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ETH/USD are so consistent within a single exchange (trading within the exchange is probably low cost, low risk, and fast). Whenever you see a huge discrepancy in price, there probably are some hidden fees/risks/barriers preventing arb traders from profiting.

So apparently it's unanswered. 
There's this 1031 rule that lets you trade similar assets without tax implication. But it seems dubious that Bitcoin and say, tether, would be like-kind.

Except that bitcoin wouldn't solve this problem at all. The banks aren't holding billion of dollars in currency. They're holding stocks, bonds, loans, and derivatives. The crash happened because investment bankers bought highly speculative and somewhat fraudulent instruments that were sold off as safe investments. They were so over exposed to this asset class that when those instruments tanked, they went bankrupt. Banks in a bitcoin economy would just use bitcoin and alt-coins as their liquid asset, and everything else would be the same.

You're essentially betting that bitcoin growth will beat the interest rate, and saying that you want to rely on bitcoin growth to fund your lifestyle. In hindsight, those were good choices for 2016 or 2017, not so good for other years.

No, I'm talking about the CDO tranches that were labeled AAA at times when they were actually shit and then fell to zero, causing the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Fannie and Freddie, etc. The housing crash was so bad because the overrated tranches were sold to traditional investors who managed common people's life savings instead of just hedge funds. 
The point is, don't confuse highly speculative instruments aka bitcoin with low or even medium risk investments.  I'm fully aware that bitcoin could easily outperform the market. But even if this was 95% likely, is the 5% risk worth it? Even if it is beating the market 10 and 30 years from now, what if 17 years from now is a huge bitcoin dip? Understand risk and price volatility. I mean, with your guys attitude, skip the "basket of stocks". Leverage up and go buy [SPXL]( Why not, it's massively beaten the market almost every year.

What do you mean the "cost to mine that coin"? If you mine a coin, that's income. It doesn't matter if you decided to spend $30,000k on a bunch of 1080s. Maybe it's different if you're a corporation.

If salary/bank account wasn't enough to pay for something due to "life", your options are:
- your regular investments (~7% annual growth)
- your crypto (x% annual growth)
- their loans (10-15% annual interest rate)
Suppose you needed $10k loan, and will repay in one year. If you chose to deduct from your investment account, you'd miss $700  in stock gains, vs. a 10% loan which would cost $1000. Using the regular investment account would be $300 better than their loans. 
The only thing the loans would be better than is something that had growth larger than 10%, aka what you hope is true about bitcoin. So if you're using their loans, assuming you aren't a business already flipping money &gt;10% per year, you probably are doing so because you would have been using bitcoin. This is all just another way of saying


but by all means go ahead and throw away 3%+ of your money for no reason.

Ok yes technically Bitcoin as a product of pure irrational speculation can be treated in such a manner as to have unbounded market cap. But at the end of the day, the value of stocks are based on the underlying value of the company and expect growth. Bitcoin isn't tied to any company, so it's value is based on bitcoins expected purchasing power. It doesn't really make sense for bitcoin to have a market cap larger than the total supply of currency. This year narrow money ~ 40 trillion. If everyone everywhere made the switch to bitcoin today, each coin would be worth $2M.

I wanted to arb ETH /BTC on gdax and cex.io but gdax's ID process isn't working for me :/. The exchanges just weren't built for this volume of interest.
Also, there is insane BTC/USD arb between the exchanges but I think this is due to the troubles of depositing/withdrawing USD. So even if you could do +10% trades, you could randomly lose your USD portion of the arb for a month.

Short term gains (selling in less than a year) are treated just like your salary, so it's taxed at the rate of your marginal tax bracket. For single people, 
15%	is for $9,326 to $37,950
25% is for $37,951 to $91,900
28% is for $91,901 to $191,650
I'd imagine most of us are one of those three. You'd have to make $400k a year to get to the 39% bracket. Long term gains tax rate are based on which of these brackets your income belongs in.
15% bracket gets 0% capital gains tax
25-35% brackets get 15%
39% bracket gets 20%

When you spend fiat, you're doing so because the utility now gained from food, shelter, entertainment etc. is better than the utility from getting more money later. So by all means you can spend your fiat now.
The problem with "bitcoin as a job" is the price volatility. Sure if you owned n BTCs  and got a stable 5% per week, week after week, you could re-balance down to $20,000 taking out $1k for an annual income of $52k. But bitcoin is highly volatile. Most of our gains came in Nov and the summer. For the first half of the year, most weeks you would not have been able to pay yourself the full amount, and some weeks you wouldn't have been able to pay yourself at all. Worst of all, in you had no way of knowing that things would get better.
That system isn't feasible unless you could sustain yourself off of your savings from previous years, which is probably not sound advice for someone making $52k a year.

Yeah exponential growth when hit with some sort of hard cap can become logistic growth, like world population. The only way we get $1M bitcoin is if there was some catastrophic deflation event like coinbase and other storage companies lose all their coins, someone hacks the mining network to fraudulently spend bitcoins to dead addresses. And then somehow the system has to regain trust within the community, and we don't decide to rollback hardfork like with ETH and the DAO.
