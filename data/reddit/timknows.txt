They don't really want Bitcoin, they want the huge returns. When there is money to earn, Wallstreet comes knocking.

I never had any problems with Bitstamp. But I heard people from questionable countries have more problem with it. Where are you from?
Ps. Wrong subreddit, so downvote.

Communist moves like this are exactly the reason why Crypto will prevail.
Hurry up Substratum, give China freedom.

Nah, the cryptowhales can smoke out those short positions easily.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:53:40
There is one flaw in the theory.. If the Wallstreet whales would be closing their short positions today the price would spike hard and fast. That is not happening.

Lowest point will be the equation of the epidillemus, this is a fraction which never has been wrong. According to many scientific studies this means the probability of the outcome is not less then 96,52%. Nor can it ever be bigger then the faulty equivalatus chart. In a nutshell: Nobody fcking knows!!
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:59:30
I can appreciate the choice of words. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:54:28
Thanks for the update grandma. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:18:50
That would be SO sick..
That would mean retirement for a lot of people here I think. It could be possible, sure.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:43:58
Posts like this are mostly a monologue, trying to convince yourself you made the right move. 
At the end of the day investors decide themselves what is the right play.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:12:21
That's the point of giving free money....
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:36:15
We do have to pay wealth tax yes, it's less then the 1,3% though. It starts at around 0,68% and get larger the more you have, it's a box system. 
But holding crypto cannot be measured by the government, so it would not be smart to pay money over those holdings.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:16:38
Is it only for Yanks or can Europeans trade there as well?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:58
Does going broke count as payback guys?
Guess Bitcoin will be USA and Europe exclusive.

Most trading happens by computer using algorithms. And the price does not skyrocket from on moment to another. There are 1000 of chances to get in, and get out for better prices.

But if there are no currencies to pair BTC with, it will have no measurable value. 
1 BTC = 1 BTC?

@_date: 2018-01-30 09:46:15
They do have a lot of coins other exchanges don't have, but they also accept a lot of scam coins to be on their exchange. So it's no wonder they will get shut down for this. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:52:56
Impressive calculation. 
But very unrealistic scenario. I Give it a 0,0000001% chance of happening, if I'm optimistic.

It's so volatile, that what you had on 1 january, could be worth 20x more or less the next month. So there is a lot of room to play regarding taxes. Of course you have to let the IRS know that you own crypto assets.
I work in taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:45:16
Of course not, the trend is still bearish. 
We will break that trend around 14K

Again, check the charts. This is a normal and most of all, healty correction. 
I am 90% certain Bitcoin will reach at least 25K this year.

Sucks for those employees. But Bitcoin was never for bankers, so that's a good thing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:08:24
Does it matter? Facebook is for 50+ people, most of them don't even have crypto's...
But it's because they cannot know which Ico is a scam and which one is real. Therefore they banned it to protect their users.

Why leave thousands worth of crypto on an exchange? 
Such a big exchange will never steal, they make too much. There is a logical explanation.
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:07:25
Wow I hope you will find it, you could be rich.

This makes me very bullish, thanks GS! Better turn that name in BS.
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:24:49
Yes that's 1,6% but that's not the standard they use. There is a minimum amount they charge. If you would withdraw 13 subs, you'd still pay 12.

Everybody would be rich if his keeps happening over and over, stop being a sheep. We might as well reach ATH's within 2 weeks, who knows.

Hang in there, it will pay out. 6 more months are you are driving a lambo my man.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:44:22
Depends on the coin I believe. For example, I wired 750 Substratum to a wallet,  it costs 12 Subs to do so.

Why prevent shorting? It keeps the market healthy
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:45:22
So in a way, if you are an investor yourself, you are calling yourself a bad investor?

Step three: Go long at BTC $5000
Step four: Millionaire.

Well this market is retarded, the reaction is logic. Just wait a little.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:40:42
Exchange rate is good, around 0,25-0,50% I believe. Yes they have made a statement about that a couple of days ago, I think it will decrease on the short term, can't lose their competitor edge.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:26:33

You also have the mental capacity of a 5 year old, good job.

It will NEVER drop to 0, I pledge that I will always be willing to pay 1$ for a BTC. Thus it will not drop to zero. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:23
But why post about it? People should just do their thing, instead of making shit posts about it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:35:22
Nice, hopefully we get a big boost, just like with the banker bonusses! oh wait...

@_date: 2018-02-21 10:28:25
Hmm ok, but we go down. Thanks anyways.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:51:37
Daily close above 7600 and we are back in track for the bullish trend.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:53:37
It's one of the likely possibilties from technical analysis. (4.5 is too low I believe) Or we break the 9500-9700 regions with high volume and after that 11.7. Then we are in full Bull mode again. 
But 4.8 - 5.2 is a possibilty. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:09:42
Up, down or sideways is always the case. Technical analysis says to what degree, so you can time when to sell/buy.
It helps you to be right 65% of the times. Which is nice if you are a trader like me. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:50:33
Daily close above 7600 is bullish af. Let's see...
