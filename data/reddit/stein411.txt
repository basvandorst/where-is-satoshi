Thank you for making this comment, I started following everyone mentioned and this Bitfinexed account is nothing but FUD and trolling, I was looking for any information from the account that could be considered useful, but I just don't see any at all.

Is there an easy way to remove the 0.00000001 transaction?  I've got two of them sitting in my wallet with 0 confirmations that I would like to get rid of, they've been there for 10 days now.

I had a pending withdrawal which was pending since about mid-December, log on today to see it's been canceled, no warning, no indication that I ever HAD a WD pending at all... nice.  Support in the chatbox is still saying they are processing WD's, just very slowly, to just be patient.  My take on this is that they are just throwing buckets of water out of the sinking ship and trying to keep as many people as quiet as they can.

Thanks, I went and checked it out, going to take a while to get here from France, but sounds like it will secure me very well!

Thanks!  I went with the Ledger Nano S, it's very similar (from what I can tell) to a two-factor authentication much like the Blizzard Authenticator, or Steam guard, or an RSA token.

When I emailed them I specifically asked if I could maintain my spot in line while upgrading, and Debbie said I would not lose my place in line.  My worry (like everyone else I'm sure) is that the complexity might be so high by June that it would take an extremely long time to make back the cost of the unit, let alone making any profit.

Very cool, mine just arrived today.  It was really odd because the post office supervisor jumped in his personal car to deliver it.  I could hear him talking to my wife and saying "I have a package from France!"  I think maybe it came in too late to make it to the truck, so really cool of him to drive it over.

I'm thinking you meant ~.0001?  I just got an email saying I got .0002, not complaining at all, just pointing out I think there might be a missing 0 up there.
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:14:43
Nope, in the states.  Took a while for it to get here.
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:55:48
Yeah, like I've got to hurry right?  I should have worded that better.

Nothing as of yet to an email I sent on 9/19 at around 9:00am central time, I was starting to get a little nervous, but man 6 days seems like a long time when other people apparently are getting refunds within minutes or hours.  Not sure if I should follow up with my CC companies or not at this point.

From the information that I've seen (please correct me if incorrect) I believe the BFL miners are supposed to run with much less energy use at a higher hash rate per KW?
Not that I'm a BFL fanboy, but I DO hope they deliver as I have a Little SC on order.

So just updating this to say that I did indeed decide to upgrade to the Little Single.  What the hell... it's only money. :)  It would be nice to be able to predict what the future holds, but I'm coming up empty on estimates of what the network difficulty will be in 3-4 months time.  I'm assuming that's because there's just too many unknowns at this point (how many Avalon's ship/are purchased, if BFL actually does get units out the door, etc.).  It's a gamble, and not like I'll be in the poor house if I choose poorly.  Thanks for the input guys.
