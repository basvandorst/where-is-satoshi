We have filtered the IP address and removed the server so it should not be a problem, but we recommend NOT TO run any .exe that look suspicious. Stay out of harm and be safe, do not open unknown files from unknown sources.

It was not a coincidence, we got a complaint to our email with this link.
We currently have no proof, but we were convinced that the abuse is real after so many comments and several abuse reports, so we acted immediately and suspended the server to keep the community safer.

Yes, of course, but in this situation the source code clearly shows an IP from our network, so until cleared out of suspicion the server must be suspended to prevent harm.

Use multisig with private keys created offline on different devices (preferably secure systems) is the best way. Don't forget to have a disaster recovery plan.. loosing keys is as common as theft is.
