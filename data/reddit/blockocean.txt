 If understand correctly, segwit only fixes malleability when using a LN payment channel. Is this not correct? Is malleability still a factor when segwit transactions actually "settle" on chain "exactly" like current transactions?  
Edit: I stand corrected, obviously these transactions are on-chain.
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:30:04
It does seem effective at maintaining a full mempool and increasing fees. Interesting that F2Pool is the worst offender when it comes to mining blocks with few tx's.
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:03:59
The question is pretty simple.   
I understand that segwit transactions eventually "settle" on-chain, I was referring to the type of transactions we use today.   
Can someone help explain how segwit TX's will settle on chain? 
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:39:32
Why not? It's a legitimate question. Feel free to join the open discussion.
@_date: 2017-02-19 04:17:56
This is not entirely true, if someone operates a low latency node network connected to thousands of peers, there is a high probability that a large percentage of transactions could be traced to the true source IP address of the sender. When using an online wallet, the company who operates the wallet would have data that could potentially de-anonymize a transaction as well.
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:19:01
Doesn't each segwit TX effectively have two txid's when implemented via soft-fork? Wouldn't this technically require more space for a single TX? 
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:06:11
Thanks for clarifying this, I don't see this mentioned very often.
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:57:14
Right, are we unable to spend normal TX's after segwit is activated? It sounds like normal TX's won't change in regards to malleability. Can someone clarify this?
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:13:15
Wouldn't the segwit nodes effectively use more space for each transaction since they need to store witness data for each transaction? Why is this preferred over a normal TX which has only a single txid per actual tx? How is it not more efficient to just raise the block size?
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:37:58
How can I ensure that someone else sending me BTC is opting-in? What if they just send me a normal TX?
@_date: 2017-02-19 04:36:48
This is simply not true. Miners themselves could decide to change Bitcoin, given consensus between them. If the users truly disagree with the miners, the market would force the miners to move to the best chain, or risk massive losses. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:42:48
You sure about that? I found the following on Bitcoin Core's website. 
     
"Note: segwit transactions only avoid malleability if all their inputs are segwit spends (either directly, or via a backwards compatible segwit P2SH address)."   
   
Am i reading this incorrectly?   
What about non-segwit spends?
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:11:08
Set up your own pool and let me know how plug-n-play worked for you.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:54:58
End the fed
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:57:54
Bull run caused transaction backlog  . . obviously. Why was the blocksize not raised before this happened?
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:09:38
I just added a new startup flag as soon as i noticed it was down   
took about 5 seconds   
-use-thinblocks=0   
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:25:38
So you're fine with economic consensus ONLY after segwit activation?   
Thank you for clearing that up.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:22:36
Why don't you run one then?
@_date: 2017-02-19 04:28:35
Miners could start producing blocks larger than 1MB right now.(Bitcoin.com accidentally did this, and they lost 13 BTC) It seems the reason they don't is because there must be some form of consensus between them. Miners realize that a premature fork of the network is shooting themselves in the foot.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:00:45
Segwit locks in and LN isn't even ready LOL no relief for the coming backlog ;)   
Edit: really though, is lightning ready yet?
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:06:50
That's a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:07:05
The other chain doesn't have hats, this seems more like a UASF gathering.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:08:11
It's not an exploit, this feature is the only reason the chain survived at the beginning of the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:11:14
Most of the miners on BCH appear to be holding their rewards currently.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:27:12
miners will run the code they choose, good thing we don't have to ask permission to join the network . . .
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:28:28
It affects block times on Bitcoin and has the potential to cause mempool backlogs.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:35:46
Is LN actually working anywhere yet?   
How soon after segwit activation can average users expect before they can use LN for themselves?   
Was looking forward to trying it out, how can I run a node?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:49:48
Why would anyone float the tx fee just out of good will?
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:54:38
you're assuming both chains are still working
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:09:11
I send payments to my offline wallet all the time for cold storage purposes.   
What other means do you propose to connect to the channel?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:44:49
Don't we need lightning in order to take advantage of the cheaper(by weight) block space?
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:39:46
of the nodes who can actually vote? 89%
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:53:06
Satellites are relaying tx's all day, what's the big deal?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:07:48
Yes, if there are no miners transactions can never be confirmed in a block   
Eventually when the 21 million cap is reached, miners will only be rewarded with transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:32:11
We need to do it right away to reduce the damage being irreversibly done to Bitcoin by blocks being too large.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:32:08
Bitclub   
BTC.com   
BTC.top (though it appears they are mining anonymously and not tagging their blocks)
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:13:42
I mean without an internet connection. With traditional TX's this works just fine, I can fire up my node and learn of transactions that happened while I was disconnected.   
If someone sends me a payment via a channel that I have established, could I be offline and still receive the transaction when I decide to re-connect?   
Or would that mean the channel is no longer established since i'm offline?
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:21:59
I don't think we can change difficulty without a hardfork.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:13:37
The other chain who's genesis block hash is 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f, follows the 21-million coin creation schedule and could soon have the most cumulative proof of work.   
Never heard of it?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:38:31
Too bad it won't help with the backlog :(
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:56:47
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:03:19
Correct, it's not a democracy. It's a republic of miners and users.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:37:58
What about this 8MB block with 37,814 transactions?   
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:32:40
It will not increase the blocksize for non signature data.  
99% of transactions post activation will not be separating their signatures, thus gaining no benefit until something like Lightning becomes available.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:21:34
Hmm, seems like the only outcome of this is increased pressure on the bitcoin chain as it does not have this retarget mechanism.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:02:33
lol, the other chain doesn't have this problem
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:48:35
Haven't they been working on LN for like two years or more?   
I'm surprised there is no working version on Litecoin by now.   
Wouldn't it be a good testbed?   
   
Does this mean that post-segwit activation most people will still be required to use the same type of TX in use today? (e.g. not separating the signatures)
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:25:39
Miners are acting rationally, they are greedy after all.   
Isn't it beautiful? Greed securing a network.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:49:39
Dev says it's not ready.   
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:59:39
You're distracting from the main point.   
Segwit will not immediately increase the transaction throughput of the network for 99% of current tx's.   
Most people doing a typical payment won't be using segwit until "Lightning implementations" are ready.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:35:52
:( so my offline, arguably more secure transactions will be more expensive. Especially considering the new weighting mechanism.   
Too bad the unbanked populations of the world with limited connectivity wont be able to partake. This seems like a significant limitation of Lightning, is there a possible fix for this to enable offline tx's?
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:55:38
I'm curious though if being offline for an extended period of time is enough to be out of sync with the channel state. In that case it's impossible for you to create a backup of the correct state or to even know which state is correct.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:53:15
So theoretically you could just ddos one of your peers continuously to prevent them from learning about the current state and hope they try and force close out of frustration.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:56:37
How can OP verify the channel state is old if he can only trust his peers not to lie about the state?
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:41:33
I'm confused, what is wrong with optimizing your hardware?
@_date: 2017-04-12 04:57:08
Bitcoin needs hosts with good up time, your node needs to be online long enough to start receiving incoming connections. If the node is only up for a few hours a day, you would be increasing the load on the network.
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:05:35
or just restrict outbound connections to only allow connections to your stratum proxy like everyone else
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:33:55
Can we use the lightning network now? Is there a lightning client?
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:19:44
Most residential routers do permit this. I'm assuming most miners keep an eye on their router traffic logs and are using something other than a off the shelf Linksys router.
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:24:48
this backdoor could not be used to kill 70% of the hashrate.
Who in their right mind thinks all bitmain hardware is connected directly to the internet?
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:21:36
Hmm, reduces the amount of work a miner needs to do and not more efficient? Huh  
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:32:49
Sounds like a feature.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:34:54
It depends if you think Bitcoin should be digital cash or not.   
I think that's the entire debate.   
Interesting to note the most successful criminals in politics currently, are banking institutions with a dying business model.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:41:42
Those are not blockchains though, maybe if you were comparing Bitcoin/Litecoin and Ubuntu/Mint that would be correct.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:44:00
This guy gets it, digital cash is good. End the fed.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:31:22
Ad hominem arguments are hard
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:32:03
I mean, he's not wrong about the centralization issue.    
Oh and ASICBOOST
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:01:29
I understand that the invalid channel is invalid and cannot settle on chain, but if funds were forwarded from an invalid channel to a valid one, it sounds like the latter channel can still settle on chain, is this not correct?
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:08:40
It appears that the initial channel state is dictated by funding_output_index, not any on-chain transaction correct?   
So your point is moot.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:22:23
Of course it describes the channel that will eventually settle on-chain, that's why this bug is so serious.    
   
The channel state is not determined by the funding tx, instead it's confirmed by an arbitrary funding_output_index field that basically has nothing to do with the funding transaction itself.
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:24:55
Wait so I can request to open a channel with a few sats
The node will accept the channel
I can then respond with a bogus \`funding\_output\_index\` in the \`funding\_created message\`
The node will only check the # of confirms of the funding\_txid, rather than checking if funding\_output\_index is valid
The node then signs my funding without actually checking the validity of the funding\_created\_message Just blindly assuming my funding created message is valid?
Assuming the invalid funds are forwarded to a valid channel, I can then withdraw more money from the channel than i have originally deposited at initial channel request?
Interesting . . . Seems like a pretty bad bug indeed.
I wonder how many nodes have yet to upgrade
