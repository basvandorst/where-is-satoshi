You... don't understand how SSL certs work, do you?
And this is only the cert for blog.blockchain.info -  has its own cert and does not use wordpress.com's
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:06:34
Not an excuse for what?  The Cert still works for encryption, they just didn't pay for a custom one for the domain.

Nothing you said in anyway contradicts what I said, fuckoffplsthankyou.

Some dumb folks over in that thread.

Thinking "ethically legal" is something that's real != not good with words.
@_date: 2012-01-12 21:52:12
Hm.. as far as I'm aware, that's already the case.  Alrighty then.

Check into FDA regulations before you start selling a home-made food product.  It can be strange.
@_date: 2012-05-25 15:18:53
Now that I don't know.  I'm also not sure that they would make that distinction.  
I'm fairly certain you're allowed to gift food products without any regulation, but I don't know about trading for non-regulated-currency or what the government would consider BC to count as.

I see you're trying to apply the "Consensus Cracking" technique from OPs article. 
You're doing it poorly.  
@_date: 2012-01-12 21:32:28
..I fail to see the parallel.  Can you fill me in?

Hate to break it to you, but mt gox isn't "massive".

Two thoughts...
1)  Why continue to use an ewallet with this story becoming more and more common?
2)  If he already made off with the btc, how do you propose one could transfer them?
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:44:22
I can't help but imagine it'd be better to invest that money in just buying/trading BC based on market value.
However, best of luck to you!  Should be quite a setup.
@_date: 2011-06-10 18:01:18
I do admit my mistakes.. in my post that you're replying to I acknowledged that I initially mistook the functionality of MG as a BC &gt; Cash exchange then, when corrected, changed gears to discussing it as a seller to buyer middle man.  
As a personal rule, I don't edit previous posts (except for minor grammatical corrections) for integrity's sake.  I don't like making people look like they're replying to something I haven't said by changing the initial post.  I do this because I don't like having people *I've* replied to change their post to make *me* look foolish.
The methodical downvoting doesn't bother me, I've got karma to spare, but it certainly says something about those engaging in the behavior, especially when applied to posts made after the "target" has shifted away from what they were initially upset about.

Man, I'm at work till 4:30.. nothing productive is getting done.
If I was wrong about something, though, seriously, let me know.  I like to correct my thoughts to not keep-being-wrong.

While it's a good joke, and the best entropy is adding more characters, it makes ridiculous assumptions about the attacker being able to make accurate assumptions about the victim.  
@_date: 2011-05-18 14:46:43
Same as they would any other non-USD currency, I'd imagine.  
My guess would be a middle-man that converts it (and any other currency they accept) on the fly into the shop's native currency.  
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:56:23
Suggested edit: The above post explained that MG is a buyer to seller middle man, not doing the exchanges personally.  I understand this to be the case.  Going forward, keep that in mind.
==================== 


Ok.  So what happens when everyone becomes a seller and there are no buyers left?
Obviously MtGox is making a profit either way.  They'd be dumb not to be.  I don't think that's the point of discussion at hand.
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:07:22
I know, it was a rhetorical question to point out a flaw in the guy I replied to's comment :)  If you look to my initial post in this thread, our predictions match up.  The market is going to plummet and everyone dumping money into gear to generate them or straight up exchanging to buy them is going to be pretty upset. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:30:06
I don't follow...
Also, you forgot a 'b'.
@_date: 2011-06-09 14:21:06
I didn't read his post, but he's probably right.  The rate of adoption should be a major concern.
Wait.. in a few months once everyone realized that the BCs they bought are now worth 500% or more what they paid for them and that the exchange rate has stopped climbing so steeply (it will plateau eventually).  Why bother holding on to them at that point?  Sell them off for a quick, big profit.. At that point, there will start to be a mass exodus of changing BC back to real money, which will lower the value and prompt more people to exchange back, etc...
Hopefully that won't happen, but it seems pretty obvious that it will.
@_date: 2011-08-19 15:47:09
Right.  A rainbow table would be way faster.  *This* is just silly.  And it assumes you're using a 26 character alphabet (and that the hacker knows this)... so.. yeah.  Pretty weak chart all around :P
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:49:32
I'm afraid most sources (all that I've seen, but I don't like to assume) assure me the correct spelling is "dumbass"...
Either way, what have I royally fucked up?

@_date: 2011-06-10 14:28:11
You need to elaborate.. is your question will they have enough cash on hand to cover it?  Probably not.  
Also, there's nothing forcing them to do the exchange, so they can just stop once they are out of resources.

Good call.  I didn't think about using a backup before he got the chance.. that's a very good idea.
And yeah, if we're not talking about using a 3rd party, I definitely agree with your points about backing up/storing the wallet. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:59:54
Well then, since you obviously don't read posts you reply to, I'm not going to reply to you any more.
Here's what I said:


@_date: 2011-06-10 17:32:40
Hm.. I dropped that immediately when it was pointed out that its a straight seller to buyer exchange.  That's why I switched from "what happens when they run out of cash?" to "what happens when there are no more buyers?"  
Sorry you missed the transition... I haven't been talking out my ass or trying to defend the thought that MG trades BC for cash.  You guys need to chill on the hivemind and read and respond to the posts based on what they say.. not what other comments say they say. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:30:53
Yeah, that makes sense as well.. a lot of people triggered to buy at a certain point hoping that others doing the same will drive the price back up and they'll be able to sell out before everyone else does.
I wonder how long that cycle will go on until it all settles.
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:54:38
If you were a non-techie who had no problem with USD, I wouldn't try to convince you to use bitcoin.  Because there's no reason for you to give a shit and I know it.
