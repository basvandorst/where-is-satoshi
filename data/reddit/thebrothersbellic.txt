It's been 15 hours and nothing has happened. I am now getting this message when I view the blockchain, "Warning! this transaction is a double spend. You should be extremely careful when trusting any transactions to/from this sender."
What does this mean? I have just been waiting patiently for this to conform all day now I am being hit with this.

Thanks for the input mate. I will look for ways to resend the BTC with a higher fee. There's no way I can lose the coins is there? If it remains unconfirmed for a certain amount of time does it just get resent back to the original wallet?

Here is the blockchain link if you're interested, any help would be appreciated.

You know, it'd be nice if you could give me some advice at least instead of calling me a troll.

I did try to accelerate the process by using viaBTC.com's acceleration tool, and that is when the message of the double spend appeared. I'm not sure if the two are linked.

I have a transaction from 10 hours still hasn't been confirmed once. Wtf is wrong

It was a transfer to myself to a different wallet. All is good now though, I just don't know why it took so long.
