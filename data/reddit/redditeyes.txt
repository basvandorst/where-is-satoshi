Can somebody with technical knowledge confirm if this is possible?
Personally, I've never had problems with transactions.

I find it surprising that a guy who just lost hundreds of thousands of dollars still thinks:


If there were some of these "regulations" in place, maybe OP wouldn't have lost all that money.
Claiming that since some regulations are bad, we should have no regulations at all, is like claiming that since some laws are bad, it's better to have no laws at all. Well, visit some third-world countries and see how well that goes.

The reason BTC is immediately converted to fiat is because the BTC price is so unstable.
If more merchants start accepting it, why would the price stabilize?

MtGox is gone, you are being scammed.

Because a lot of people use cryptocurrencies to make a quick buck on market speculation. You buy when prices are low, you sell when prices are high.
This is like asking "why do people buy stock shares instead of keeping their money securely under a pillow?". Because you can use money to make more money.

Ok, thanks!

So if I make a transaction to a valid address, there is no technical way for those BTC to get lost?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:05:05
I agree. My point was not to claim the two situations are absolutely the same. I was just pointing out that instead of sitting on it, people use money to make more money.

Has android/google banned bitcoin apps?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:09:19
It isn't official.
But at this point the chances of this are so high, people are starting to accept their money is gone.

A quick google search gave me this:


I doubt it's impossible to force halving several times (or simply make the halving much quicker) with a fork.

But hacking a big financial institution is a lot harder and happens rarely, precisely because there are regulations in place. Even when they are hacked, people don't lose everything due to various insurance policies, because again - there are government regulations.
You make it sound as if hacking doesn't happen in the cryptoworld, but I have personally lost money on MtGox and then again on CryptoRush.

Never visit a phishing website from an email
1) You confirm your email is in use, so expect more spam
2) Opening a website might infect your computer (even if you don't download anything), because browsers are not perfect and have security issues.

What's the point of having an argument with you, when you are so biased? There is 0% chance anybody can change your mind. And there is 0% chance you will convince anybody else.
I'm so sad the bitcoin community is overrun by libertarians. It's destroying it as a currency :(
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:16:35


The only way to enforce this is through regulation. And the bitcoin community will never accept that, because it's overrun by libertarians who are more interested in fighting "evil government" rather than creating a stable currency.
