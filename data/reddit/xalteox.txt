There is absolutely no requirement that each closing transaction must be an individual transaction. This however can only be done if you have a graceful closure with all channels.

You are quite a bit confused.
LN will consist of payment channels between two individuals. You can send the coin to one another basically infinitely times for free and basically instantly. Without getting into the details, essentially this is because your coin is in a state of limbo in the channel in reference to the blockchain where you can either publish the transaction to the blockchain and receive your coin or not do that and make new transactions to replace this one.
Problem is the coin is locked in this channel and the only way to pay someone else directly with it is to close the channel. 
Fortunately we have a work around via channel hopping. Say I want to pay Alice. I don’t have a channel with Alice, but both of us have one with Bob. We can use some magic called hashlocks have bob essentially use his channel to forward my transaction to Alice. The fee in this case would be what bob requests in return for forwarding my transaction. He decides the fee for me, I decide whether or not I accept his fee.
But if I have a direct channel with Alice, there is no fee. That would be stupid, it’s like the cashier asking you for a fee to hand her a dollar bill.

The most glorious thing about lightning isn't the lightning itself, it is the Schnorr signatures to come and channel factories. We can have the entire network come together and forge a single transaction opening up thousands of lightning channels, then take all the signatures required for it and combine them into one. I thought 1 mb wasn't enough for lightning but this is a gamechanger.

Nope. 
You might think that “the T9 chips are broken while the S9 are perfect, the T9 is therefore trash.” But that would be wrong because I guarantee that S9 chips aren’t perfect either. We engineer these things down to nearly atomic precision, it isn’t perfect though basically all the time. Just some times are worse than others.

Same reason why Intel doesn't/can't make nothing but i7s. Chip binning.
Microchip manufacturing isn't perfect, you will always get some chips that are better and some that are worse. Intel tries to make nothing but the highest end chips but that doesn't happen. Say they make try to make a 4 core i7, but one or two cores are broken. To not have it be a total waste, they disable the broken cores and call it an i3. Or say that the chip can't run as fast as another. Then that chip will have a lower clockspeed and be marketed as such.
Same applies here.

@_date: 2018-01-10 04:24:59
Ah, very important thing that they said was confusing.
The "private key" they are referring to is not a digital signature private key. It is something called a hashlock.
A hashing algorithm takes some value and turns it into a jumble of characters. For example, the most common current algorithm, SHA256, turns "Satoshi Nakamoto" into 2658FF323352C9B2EF78A7F2ABEB3C9E8AB6B04FFFF6EBD9F6DFA1B493631BA2.
When using the hashing algorithm, it will always turn "Satoshi Nakamoto" into the value above. It isn't reversible though, it only works one way. The idea here is that it is computationally infeasible to turn a hash into something that makes the hash.
The hashlock adds a requirement to a transaction that in order to be activated, a value that has a certain hash must be in the transaction. In lightning, by hiding the key from the other party and hashlocking a transaction, it can be used as bargaining chip in finalizing a transaction. For future reference, I will refer to this as the "hashlock key." You should too to avoid confusion. 
Its all in the ordering of things.
Your idea does not work because it would not be economically viable to do so. In your case, Alice would be gaining monies and there isn't an attack she can do by using the old transaction since old transaction would be the one before she gets money, so trying to attack with that would actually send Bob money. That said, the downside of this is that the channel is halted because Bob will then refuse to make new transactions with her.
The video didn't properly explain the handshake, many Lightning videos just show a transaction happening all at once while there are several steps through which scamming is prevented.
Bob wants to send Alice money 1 Bitcoin. 
Step 1: Bob asks Alice to generate a hashlock. Standard procedure, Bob most likely is only doing this if he wants to send Alice money so Alice complies. If she doesn't do this, Bob may consider the channel either dead or Alice's computer off so he could close it and fail sending Alice anything. 
Step 2: Bob uses Alice's hashlock to craft a transaction and send it to Alice, along with hashlock of his own. At this point in time, Alice should not consider the transaction final since her last transaction is still valid since they have not shared hashlock keys. Bob however, must consider this transaction final, there is nothing stopping Alice from publishing it. He accepts this fact since he was sending her monies in the in the first place.
Step 3: Bob states that as a requirement for getting his hashlock key from the previous transaction, Alice must craft the mirroring transaction and send it to him. Alice has no economic incentive not to do this since this transaction, even if spent by Bob, is only giving her money, and in return, Bob will send her the hashlock key from the previous transaction, which finalizes it from her end. So she does that.
Say Alice for some reason decides not to do this. Alice can publish the transaction Bob sent her with no repercussion, but on the other hand, Bob can publish his old transaction and effectively pretend the transaction never happens.
Step 4: At this point, they are on equal footing, both has the other's return transaction. Bob now considers it safe to send his old hashlock key to Alice since he has a transaction with which to redeem his coin. If Bob does not do this, the channel halts and Alice can simply publish the newest transaction, Bob can try to publish the old one but that is fine, since without Bob's hashlock key, Alice does not consider the transaction final. So anyways, Bob sends his key over and asks for Alice's.
Step 5: Alice sends her hashlock key over, finalizing the transaction.
There is only one real incentive for her to do this, and that is to continue the channel's existence. If Alice refuses, Bob considers any new transactions sent from her invalid as she did not give him the key from 2 transactions ago and therefore could redeem that transaction, which could potentially steal from him. If she refuses, the channel is at a gridlock and Bob will most likely out of frustration close the channel with this newest transaction she just made. She can't be attacked in any way by sending this hashlock key so she does.
Ask if you have any questions.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:07:11
It doesn't fully remove the signature. 
It moves the signature data to the end of the transaction and doesn't hash said signature data for the transaction hash. But the coinbase must contain a merkle root of all signatures + transaction data, which links all signature data to the block.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:28:44
I mean, this can happen simply because transactions can have multiple inputs and outputs and there isn't anything in LN that forbids this. I am not aware of any papers supporting this idea, but from my pretty good knowledge of how LN and Bitcoin works I see how it could be theoretically done. 
There is actually a similar idea which effectively uses this called "channel factories." I am actually not quite certain how they work, but here is a link about them.

It takes less resources than a bitcoin block and doesn't affect the entire network like a bitcoin block, only a few nodes.

Technically you would be sending it to a script that essentially says “this can be spent by bob after x block.”

You seem to be confused. You are running a full node, this is the safest way to verify that you have either received a transaction or sent a transaction successfully. All other methods require some form of trust in others. You also help out Bitcoin by passing along the blockchain/transactions to others. So that miners will receive transactions to process and other people will also be able to run full nodes. 
You are not mining, which is what it seems you think you are doing. Mining is the process where you use large amounts of computation to secure Bitcoin transactions and in return you receive fees attached to said transactions + some freshly minted Bitcoin.
Mining Bitcoin is a process these days done mostly by specialized computers known as ASICs. You can theoretically mine using your computer but it will not be profitable, only ASIC mining will be. 
If you really want to, there are other coins which you can mine with your computer with services such as nice hash.

Originally there was no blocksize limit, Satoshi secretly added it in a year after bitcoin initially was made and when publicly asked about it, he said it was to prevent spam attacks. When asked about what happens when more than 1mb is needed, he basically said fork it in. 
That said, he later spent his time looking for second layer solutions, such as payment channels.
Now I don’t think many disagree about forking in a larger blocksize but only doing it when we have exhausted all other options.

Of course. Most here aren’t against a moderate blocksize increase if it is actually needed. They are against non-consensual hardforks and forking before other options have been explored.
Segwit managed to softfork a blocksize increase in which would effectively alleviate bitcoin’s issues if people actually use it.

You have been scammed. That screenshot has been doctored, do not proceed.
For future reference however:
All transactions have a marker called a “transaction ID” or “TXID.” It’s 64 characters consisting of the letters a through g and numbers. If he gives you the TXID, you can look it up on a block explorer such as  or  though it should automatically appear in your wallet. Just paste the TXID into the search bar and it should find the transaction. It may take at most a few minutes to show up on the block explorers, so if it doesn’t wait a bit.
Next, verify that the proper amount was sent to the right address. If he refuses to provide the TXID or link to the transaction, then you are probably being scammed.
It is impossible to fake a bitcoin transaction if you take the proper precautions to verify its authenticity. Here, you just don’t know how to do that.

Though on second thought, I highly suggest you don’t even use aes encryption or anything, bitcoin seeds allow for passwords to be attached to them and no one will be able to spend your funds without said password.

No point in broadcasting from a full node, any node will do.
Ledger currently has no way of using your own node for reference if you are asking, at least no official method (unofficial ones seem hacky). If you want to keep track of your coin on your computer, you can export the xpub from the ledger and use some software to track it on your local computer (this does not allow you to spend coin without your ledger, only track its balance), which you could hook up to say Armory (Bitcoin Core does not support xpub watching, armory is the only full node that does).

Ah. SBTC’s merger mining isn’t typical actually. Bitcoin mining involves hashing the bitcoin block header twice. SBTC mines by hashing the same block header only once. This means that each BTC hash has an intermediate process where they also produce a possible SBTC hash, this also allows SBTC to have faster blocktimes.

Can you post a signed message please?

It’s not absolutely necessary but it’s how it is implemented. Essentially you have your miner configured to check the first hash of the bitcoin block header if it is within rootstock’s difficulty. If so, it is added to the rootstock blockchain if there is additional data elsewhere (I believe the coinbase) which has the SBTC block header.

Exchanges simply match buyers and sellers together. Its a zero sum game, for every coin bought on the exchange is sold by someone else.
Sure it is possible that no one will be selling any coin, but in that case the forces of supply and demand come in. If there is no supply and high demand, price will rise, eventually enticing someone to sell on the platform again.
This is how all exchanges work, including the stock market. Nothing particularly "cryptocurrency" here. 


Sure it is possible, however portions of coins can and do recombine. If Mark sends me 0.2 BTC and Alice sends me 0.5 BTC, if I were to pay 0.7 BTC or 0.6 BTC to someone, these two "portions" would recombine.

I was wrong, it doesn't work in this scenario. But it would if the teacher gave the kids something called the master public key.
ECDSA has a cool feature which for a private key p with corresponding pubkey u, we can compute the public key corresponding the the privkey  u + a for some integer a without knowing any private key. No other signature algorithm has such a feature, and this can be used to make watch only wallets, you can compute all addresses without knowing a private key. This is how BIP32 works for non-hardened derivation (hardened derivation protects against this). 
The downside is that there are security risks, if someone manages to find a single private key and your master public key, they can find how this integer a is derived, and as a result, derive the rest of your private keys.

The final transaction, to be secure, requires a piece of data that Carol gives Alice to be placed into the LN transaction unique for that transaction (more specifically this data is the hashlock). That could be used to ID the transaction if there is not another way.

Quantum computing isn’t magic. 
What you say is true, but the key is “fast enough.”
If classical computers were fast enough, they could do the same thing, but they aren’t.
Quantum computing allows us to square root the difficulty of finding a hash collision, that is to say that a 2^256 bit hash will have the strength of 2^128 compared to a classical computer. But that is assuming that the calculations of the classical computer are at the same rate as those on the quantum computer. Which isn’t true.

There are multiple ways of doing so but the basic concept is the same, you take the other blockchain, build a valid block for it, hash said block, then insert the hash somewhere into the bitcoin block you are building, could be a transaction, could be the coinbase, this depends on the specific rules.
Any proof of work done on the block will also secure the blockhash for the other blockchain.

For simply receiving money, this isn't actually even necessary.
Due to the cool features of ECDSA, there is the possibility for what is known as a master public key.
This key can generate all the addresses of some other wallet without having a single private key. There are security concerns, but they are far less than making a private key holding cash register. 
So each cash register can have this kind of wallet, while the store owner is the only one with the private keys.

Quantum would deal a significant blow to Bitcoin as it stands.

Quantum computing breaks modern public-private key cryptography. You generate two mathematically linked numbers, a public key and a private key. The interesting thing is that you can use some fancy math to prove that you hold the corresponding private key to the public key, but without revealing the private key. 
This is how bitcoin works, private keys allow you to generate a “signature,” which is some very large number that can only be generated feasibly by the owner of the private key.
Quantum breaks this. It allows you to derive a private key from a public key. However, Bitcoin has a protection against this.
Payments are done to addresses. Addresses are hashes public keys. This means that knowing the address, you can prove that something is the public key but you cannot derive the public key from the address. When making a transaction, your public key is revealed because you make a signature using your private key. Quantum can only attack knowing the public key therefore funds are safe as long as the public key is hidden.

Basically it involves making a channel through a blockchain transaction that does two things.
1. Links funds from two parties into an "escrow" account. Each party puts whatever amount they want into this escrow account. Both parties must sign off on the transfer of funds anywhere, but of course you will not reject something that sends funds your way.
2. After a set amount of time, unless another transaction signed by both parties overrides this, funds return to the two parties, each the amount they put into this.
Now the beauty here is that the requirement of both signing off on the transfer of funds essentially solves the double spending problem so long as they are sending bitcoin to and from each other (the other person literally has to consent to the double spending against them), allowing for transactions that do not need to be put onto the blockchain immediately to make them irreversible. Say I want to send Bob 5 bitcoin while I have a channel open with him where he contributed 10 bitcoin and I contributed 20. All we have to do is make an escrow transaction that returns the bitcoin to us, but instead have the transaction return 15 bitcoin each. So long as both of us sign this transaction, it doesn't have to immediately go onto the blockchain, it just has to go onto the blockchain before the time limit runs out when our funds return to us from the escrow account. We can in this time period make updates to this transaction, each with a "timelock" that allows it to only be published to the blockchain after a certain timestamp, each update we make to this escrow return transaction, we lower the timestamp so that it will be the first that can make it onto the blockchain, invalidating the past versions. 
The big issue here is that while it solves the double spending problem, it adds some restrictions that are rather uncomfortable, for example you require consent from the other party to close an escrow account before the fund return time, meaning you can't really spend the Bitcoin outside of that channel as easily. Lightning Networks then use a trick using something called "hashlocks" that allow me to send Alice funds through Bob if Bob has a channel open with both of us, while I don't have a direct channel open with Alice. This is where the network part comes into play. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:56:32

Well, you're in luck. Drafted this up a few hours ago for a different post.


A hashlock essentially says that a transaction may only go through if the transaction contains a piece of data that has a certain hash. Here is how we can abuse this.

@_date: 2017-08-23 13:56:54


Do you know how a network works? If the end destination only has 2 channels open, it is guaranteed that it must go through one of the two. If company needs to process several thousand in transactions every week, that significantly incentivizes having more Bitcoin locked in a channel, and aside from companies, few have enough bitcoin in this sense to lock it into a channel with this coffee shop, fewer having enough to randomly lock it in random channels with various businesses in this way.
Say you have 20 dollars worth of Bitcoin and you want to open up a channel with the coffee shop. Will they do it? 
No, because the maximum that can be sent through that channel is 20 dollars, not a meaningful amount for them nor an economically incentivized one given the fees involved with opening and potentially closing channels, along with the simplicity of keeping just a few channels so that you don’t have to haggle as much in some case which you want to close the channel prematurely. For other places, this will be fine because bidirectional movement of funds will balance all of this out, but here the coffee shop is very likely going to just get bitcoin, not spend it often.
Anyways, let’s say that the coffee shop does open up a channel when you offer to front the bill for the fee. Will many transactions go through you?
No, because the whales, who have tens if not hundreds of thousands of bitcoin, will be the ones capable of opening up thousands of channels, practically guaranteeing that payment will go through them as they become the path of least resistance. Wheel and spoke.


Isn’t the entire point of Bitcoin and Lightning to make it so that this isn’t necessary? What happened to the decentralized dream?

Don’t be pedantic, what happened there was a one time event, not a general trend as we see now. One time events straining the system isn’t too much of a problem for a currency, it fixes itself in the long run.
Average blocksize is what is relevant here, a miner may not include any transactions in their block and the next one may include the ones that last one missed out, leading to a full block. This problem is self fixing through and in the long run, transaction volume is fine under such a system.
But when all the blocks (hence average) start being strained, then you have a problem. When the general trend is that your currency cannot process as many transactions as are happening, that means your currency is shit and people will move onto alternatives.
Gold is a shit currency. Don’t compare it to bitcoin.

The whole anti-Segwit argument was based around people being against an LN, it makes sense that the argument changed at this point now that the goalposts have been moved. I personally am fine with Segwit, it is a pretty good upgrade to the system, however I still see some massive potential issues with Lightning Networks. Though I can’t say that it matters much, if LNs crash and burn, we still have onchain scaling and at that point, we should have community consensus on an alternative solution like a blocksize increase. 
Though my big fear is that LNs will work, but will be incredibly centralized. Companies will rally to defend this centralization then RIP bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:27:03
The issues I am worried about aren't issues on a small beta test. It is sound technology, I believe in it, but I see potential problems mainly in two areas, centralization and what happens when escrow return transactions cannot get onto the blockchain (say transaction spam fills the blockchain or something), allowing for timelocks to expire on older transactions. 
Neither can be ruled out by a small testnet beta test.

If you have the Bitcoin to open the channels that is.
Channels with more Bitcoin in them are more meaningful and can transfer more funds than channels with less Bitcoin since they can move more bitcoin around, like if I want to send Bob 5 dollars worth of bitcoin through you and I only have 2 dollars in my channel with you, I can't do it. Whales with more bitcoin (think corporations) can also open up more of these "meaningful" channels than the rest of the network since they have the bitcoin to do so. This means these nodes will be more likely to have the transaction routed through them.
This will make it very likely that the shortest path will be through a whale of some sort. 


Not sure if you fully understood what I meant here, so I will explain. Lightning involves having a transaction that keeps updating in the channel, I send you bitcoin, you send me bitcoin, ect, but this transaction isn't published to the blockchain because it can't yet, the transaction has a timelock attached which only allows it to be published after x date. By making new transactions with a new date z less than x that is supposed to spend the original coin, we can "update" that transaction instantly without having to publish it to the blockchain. The reason this "updated" transaction is theoretically supposed to overwrite the old one is because it can be published to the blockchain first as its timelock unlocks first. But the transaction is considered complete the moment it is generated, the beauty of Lightning is that it doesn't have to be put on the blockchain immediately to be considered complete.
The problem what I see here arises from the fact that if the blockchain is clogged and this transaction doesn't make it in time before x, then the transaction with x could be published instead of the transaction with z.


No, from my understanding of things, the initial transaction that locks the bitcoin into the channel also says something like "return funds after x blocks," therefore opening a channel sets up its closing as well. 


Me neither. Someone did a centralization simulation, but they didn't account for bitcoin inequality. If anyone has anything I would be happy to hear it.

“Failure due to inflation” occur only when the populous loses faith in the currency as a means of transfer because they know on the next day it will be half as much. This results in less accepting the currency and as a result its value dropping further.

I always find this funny to hear, because it perfectly describes bitcoin today, especially in one way - it is a bad currency as it currently stands and the vast majority of holders are speculators. Such a system in my opinion will drift into obsoleteness slowly as the centuries go by, assuming we don't get into asteroid mining which breaks gold's rarity completely, the price of gold will slowly fall over the coming centuries as people see it as nothing but a shiny rock. At least Bitcoin speculators see potential in a future currency, but as it stands, it fails miserably at that. High fees, long confirmation times, ect. We will see if lightning fixes this, if not, I'd like a blocksize increase, I think that is reasonable.

Seems you are asking for a POW change here, particularly one that is "ASIC resistant." That is indeed being considered.
However mining pools are fine.  


Ultimately the reward earned here is not bigger or smaller with or without pools. Pools simply "normalize" the reward, they make you be paid consistently 1 dollar a day or something instead of a 50% chance to get 100 dollars in the next 50 days. 
Pools are fine, so long as there is a good enough number of them and hashpower is split well among them. Currently that is false, mainly because most miners are idiots and do not understand that this inhibits decentralization (ironically enough, the biggest mining pools are the ones that pay the worst). 
The only way to normalize rewards without pools is a smaller blocksize and other cryptocurrencies (eth) have proven that this still isn't enough to normalize rewards enough.


Yes, they may miss out on a very small amount of fees since they will not have gotten the latest transactions since they have been offline, but there is nothing about them not being able to produce a valid block unless they haven't downloaded the previous block.
The bigger issue is that someone else may have mined that block while they were offline and the intermittent miner may not be aware of this and waste hashpower on mining an old block. 
If your internet is only able to go online every 2 minutes or so, you are alright, as long as your download speeds are efficient (I'd say 5 megabytes every 10 minutes, not much).

That does not mean the currency has lost its use or anything, as this can easily result as of small amounts of inflation.
Assuming your inflation is more or less controlled, to small amounts, the solution here is to just stop having lower denominations. Same with bitcoin but the other way, a single bitcoin becoming too valuable isn't a problem since we can always use lower denominations like mBTC. 
Hyperinflation is another beast on its own.

Why not. Miners can just as easily run miners (and do) as us plebeians. The internet itself is designed to be a network connecting all world computers, this is quite frankly simpler. 
 &gt;
2) Over time, as the mining difficulty increases, it be possible for a protocol to randomly select a group of nodes that are currently online... and pool together their resources to mine a block? I am just thinking of ways to make mining more decentralised/egalitarian, so that people in developing countries can have a chance?
Funnily enough you somewhat just described Proof of Stake. But no, there must be a decentralized way of doing so, proof of work does it by working, proof of stake does it by staking coin. The blockchain has no concept of IPs or individual miners, so it cannot. 


Is that really true? Venezuela is having a massive amount of cryptocurrency mining going on simply because of cheap electricity. Internet itself isn't that much of a rarity today and the fact that miners can operate from anywhere allows for good flexibility as to finding a place with a connection. 
Hell, developed countries in many cases are **not** the ideal place to mine simply because of cost of electricity. 
Admittedly, your average Venezuelan right not probably cannot afford a Bitmain S9. But some can, some move in from other regions and work this just as well, point is it happens.

That is irrelevant. In the end, the public choice of client to run is the final deciding factor, and if the vast majority disagree with it, then nothing comes of their code.

* The no-wit block size is defined as the serialized block size without witness programs.
* Deploy a modified BIP91 to activate Segwit. The BIP9 version bit 4 is redefined as the segwit2x signal.
* If segwit2x activates at block N, then at block N+12960 the block weight limit rises from 4,000,000 to 8,000,000. Also the maximum sigop cost per blocks rises from 80,0000 to 160,000. Both changes represent hard-forks.
* The block that activates the hard-fork must have a no-wit block size greater than 1,000,000 bytes.
Any transaction with a non-witness serialized size exceeding 1,000,000 is invalid.

Lightning requires nodes which essentially transmit money through them, this will cost a fee. Fee is set by the node itself, game theory dictates the market will set the price and should be enough to cover costs assuming a rational market.


You need to have at least some liquidity to open up channels with various people. It doesn't actually cost any BTC, you just need to have it to run it.


The current limit of channel size is 0.16 of a BTC. That's a lot of cash, though there is a section of this which cannot be spent because it exists as "punishment collateral" to punish potential bad actors.
Any larger transaction is probably better done on the blockchain itself.
LN isn't ideal though imo. There are some very bad risks with disastrous consequences that can happen which as far as I am aware are not fixed since there isn't really a solution. So lightning does have its risks. :/

Since you don't download the blockchain it needs to ask random Bitcoin Nodes (volunteers that keep their computers on sharing the blockchain for times like this) for your balance, so you kinda share your balance with them. But that doesn't necessarily give away your identity or anything, from their end it looks like a random person asking about people’s balances. There is nothing identifying about you.
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:29:38
It’s because of the difference in timelocks. It’s not exactly that they are forced but if they want the transaction to go through they must reveal it, allowing the second transaction to go through. HTLCs are really just transaction schemes that force two transactions to occur or neither. Neither is perfectly fine, no one gets scammed in that event and that’s all that matters. Only downside is that your (and your counterparty’s) coin gets locked up in a timelock for a few days, though I believe this only happens in the event of an uncooperative counterparty, if both of you want to reverse this whole deal without waiting for the timelock expiry I believe there is a way out.
Bob creates the key and locks his transaction with it such that for you to spend it, you must be able to produce the secret key. This key must be used within 4 days, otherwise Bob can spend these bitcoin.
Now you make a transaction where bob must use the same key from his transaction to spend the within 3 days, otherwise you are able to spend the coin.
If bob wants to spend your transaction, he must produce the key within 3 days and put it in a transaction (making it now public info). This gives you one more day for you to use it before Bob can spend the transaction he made. Producing the key after 3 days risks you taking both transactions for yourself which bob would not want.  The key thing is that the non-key holder makes their timelock less than that of the key holder.
If he does not produce the key, both of you regain control of your coin after 4 days.
If everything goes as planned, both transactions are executed rather quickly (only needing time for a few blocks to pass). In lightning though, the state remains open on the blockchain.

No, the topic was on not adding replay protection. That isn't a change, therefore as I said, shouldn't necessarily be included in their specification. 
Either way, you are going off on a tangent at this point. I demonstrated the openness of their development process contrary to what you said about it being closed, criticizing their actual development process is another discussion for another time. I agree there should be testing, we will see if there is that testing soon. But the falsehood claimed here of them developing behind closed doors irks me and that was my point to get across. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:49:41
Yes although this affects if your transaction goes through or not/the time it takes for your transaction to go through. Bitcoin is a bit complicated in this aspect, there is no "guaranteed fee" which sends your transaction through. It is honestly quite a bit complicated for newcomers, hopefully the coming Lightning Network will fix that. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:38:57
The Lightning Network isn't a fork, it is a scaling solution which allows for transactions off the blockchain. The entire point of the segwit softfork earlier this year was to allow for the creation of the Lightning Network. 
It could theoretically work now (and actually does) but it needs more testing and that needs time. Can't have any bugs in the code when dealing with this much money.

Don't bother.

Firstly, they gave AMD a mere 24 hour warning before releasing this to the public, at least according to them. Google's Project Zero gives months for all exploits it finds. 
The researchers themselves said "In light of CTS’s discoveries, the meteoric rise of AMD’s stock price now appears to be totally unjustified and entirely unsustainable. We believe AMD is worth $0.00 and will have no choice but to file for Chapter 11 (Bankruptcy) in order to effectively deal with the repercussions of recent discoveries."
They took the effort to make a fancy ass video, with greenscreens instead of their offices, and practically do not go into the flaws themselves in said video. Its a social media campaign meant to spread fud on AMD.
Lastly, current indication is that **all of these bugs require administrator/superuser and even vendor signed drivers (yes, the company is the only one who can exploit this) access to exploit, and if a hacker was given that, your ass is already grass.**

Its not enough for a mining pool. Mining pools "normalize" mining rewards by having a lot of miners group up together to mine blocks more often then split the reward based on the amount of mining power each contributes. Your mining pool would take a year to mine a block on average, meaning that wait times for payouts would be very long.
For a mining pool, you need at least enough hashpower to mine a block once a week. FYI, that is about 1642 antminer s9s.

This is your problem. What is "verification?" How do I know that something has been verified? Can a malicious actor falsify a verification?
Remember, DNS solves this by being a centralized system. One of the 13 DNS root servers acts as the root of trust and scales down from there. 
 This is in fact the problem Satoshi's blockchain idea solves, the Byzantine Generals' Problem. And this has been done before with a blockchain in things like Ethereum's ENS or Namecoin. But it won't work the way you describe it. 
That said, you can 100% do something like this using Bitcoin's OP_RETURN, it would be a little wasteful IMO and require a full blockchain sync, but it can be done.

The problem is the block time. On average, a block is mined somewhere around 9.5 minutes. This means the this means the difficulty is constantly increasing.
Sure, you could keep the difficulty low and use a mining rig to to manipulate the timestamps to be 10 minutes between, meaning no difficulty change, however at some point your timestamps would pass further than the current time, and at that point nodes will reject your blocks (there is some leeway, but there are rules that blocks can't have a timestamp that is too far into the future). Note that if you start at the genesis block, you will not get even close to the current block height since the average blocktime has been 9.5 minutes over the last decade, and yours is 10, therefore you can't fit as many blocks in the time period. At that point, you will be forced to make your timestamps less than 10 minutes to get nodes to accept them, triggering difficulty increases which stops you then and there.
It is the longest chain following the rules for bitcoin. And by those rules, the conclusion will always be that the longest chain has the most work put into it.

No a channel is made after a mutual agreement among two people. Both parties must agree to forge a channel.


This actually depends on the underlying code of Lightning which I do not know of, but either one could be true.
That’s not how lightning works. You don’t “broadcast a transaction to a faraway node.” Lightning is directly peer to peer, there is no need to broadcast a transaction to all nodes.
Channels prevent the doublespend problem by essentially locking the coin in those channels and forcing both parties to sign off on a transaction, meaning the second party would have to sign off on a doublespend against him. 
We can also channel hop, but each channel enforces double spending similarly.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:35:49
Well as I said, so long as one party is fully funding it, the opening transaction does not require the other party, but the result of this is no return transaction which makes your Bitcoin probably locked in that channel unless the other party helps you get it out.

@_date: 2018-02-13 08:44:40
Well, a lot of things.
While the classical view of currency is that giving it to someone is basically like “sending it to them.” This is less true in Bitcoin, it is more like transactions contain requirements which allow the bitcoin within to be unlocked and “sent” to a different set of requirements. Normally this requirement is a signature of the transaction but it can be many things.
Bitcoin supports a relatively complex scripting language. It’s main limitation is that outside the inputs used, a transaction must be self contained, it cannot rely on outside factors to settle its requirements. 
Anyways, normally the output lists the requirement for spending some Bitcoin, such as in Pay to Pubkey Hash, where the output says “you must provide a transaction signed with the private key of a public key whose hash is x.” P2SH changes things actually quite a bit. It shifts the duty of revealing the script from the output of the transaction to the input of the transaction spending the output. Basically a P2SH output says this “to spend this bitcoin, you must provide a script with x hash and satisfy all requirements that script requires.” 
This allows you to do practically anything normal output scripting allows you to do. You can make a multisig address, where the script says that “this transaction must be signed by 2 of these 3 private keys with x y and z public keys.” You can make it so that some data that satisfies some hash must be made and put into the transaction. And a lot of other non-particularly interesting things, like making a script where you can spend it if you find what equals 27 after subtracting 14 and put it in the transaction.
But the interesting part is it’s compatibility with sending, something Segwit abuses. Normally if a person is trying to pay you, you generally can’t go up to them and “can you have your output for me be a script that does x?” The software probably doesn’t support it and any layman will be thinking “what?” and any expert will be thinking “ain’t nobody got time for that.” P2SH gets around this by having the output not require a complicated script, just a requirement that any spending transaction satisfies the requirements of a script with x hash. 
P2SH is built in with practically all modern clients for example and allows for new useful types of scripts and transactions without new software for the future, which is why everyone supported sending to segwit nested P2SH on day one but not send to true Segwit like send to bech32. 
Anyways, I think I am rambling here, but ye. It’s useful.

I don’t know what answers people are feeding you here, as far as I am aware a hashlock is what secures against this. 
Bob wants to send coin to Alice. Both of you have a channel connected to me.
Here’s what we do.
Alice generates a random number (I will call this the hashlock key) and hashes it. She sends that hash to Bob. Remember, hashing cannot be reversed, but hashing the same number will always result in the same hash.
Bob creates the transaction to me which I am supposed to forward to Alice. One of the conditions of the transaction is that attached to it must be the random number Alice generated before. Now Bob tells me that if I want the hashlock key to receive the money, I must send the coin over to Alice (minus a small fee me and Bob agreed on, which is my incentive here). 
I make a transaction to forward the funds to Alice, however I attach the same requirement that to spend it, Alice must attach the hashlock key to it.
So essentially I have no possibility of scamming here because of this hashlock.
Now, if Alice plays nice, she hands over the hashlock key and I get my coin. But why can’t Alice scam me and never give me the hashlock key? 
Now the interesting design here is that I can effectively force the hashlock key out of Alice by publishing the transaction we made to the blockchain. 
The transaction is designed such that if I publish it to the blockchain, there are three outputs, one sending me my funds after this transaction, one sending Alice funds before this transaction, and the last output is the money sent in this transaction. This last output is where the hashlock above is attached to but it also contains something called a timelock, effectively the logic of this output here is “to spend this output, you must either provide the hashlock key and Alice’s signature or after x days, you can use it simply using my signature.”
This effectively forces Alice to publish the hashlock key to the blockchain or risk the transaction being reversed. And once there, I can use it to spend Bob’s transaction. 
Bitcoin Magazine has a really good article on lightning here.

I believe these companies do have APIs and open source firmware, if someone wanted to get down to it and actually make the software for it right now they could. They basically support it now. 


I do not know the full details honestly, but lightning requires a blockchain download to be run for full trustless security with having all the most recent blocks at least once in a while (this time depends on the channel timelock). If it does not do this, it will be required to trust some authority to make sure they aren't being scammed (the risk on the scammer is far worse than this risk). That said, once the blockchain has been processed, the vast majority can be deleted, leaving only a few mb.

The returning transaction requires the other party’s signature. The opening transaction does not if one side fully funds it.
Why would a fully funded one side opening transaction require the other person’s signature? It uses inputs from any transaction, generally a typically p2pkh sent to a single wallet. This transaction sends to a multisig, which effectively makes it a channel, and then the return transaction is used to close the channel since it has both channel signatures required for the multisig.

Don’t know enough about onion routing to answer 1 and 2.
3) Hardware wallets do have encryption and decryption functions as they can be used for SSH authentication along with their typical cryptocurrency uses. 
4) Yes, sorta. It would need to validate the blockchain to be a perfectly trustless node, but yes it would be a lightning node. Lightning inherently requires a blockchain download, though it can be purged to hell, enough to hardly require space on a smartphone.
If you ran out of battery, then it would make you slightly vulnerable to attack, though not by much. Lightning requires you to be online at least once in a while when channels are open.

As good as it is of course, there are several catches.
- You must have a running process to recieve transactions. Imo, this can easily be accomplished with a raspberry pi.
- You must have a node running for full trustless security at least once in a while. Unlike classic Bitcoin, where a node is required to be able to view what transactions you’ve received with good certainty and where Bitcoin cannot be stolen from you if you do not run a node, Lightning can have funds stolen from you by a channel counterparty if you do not run a node at least once per week or something. The good news here is that a) this node can be pruned even further than a normal Bitcoin node can be, since it does not require the UTXO database, only your UTXOs, at least after the initial channel setup, and b) the attacker having even more Bitcoin stolen from them via this channel and chances of it succeeding is pretty low. 
- Now for a smaller nuisance. If your channel counterparty goes offline, you may close the channel but your funds will be unspendable until a certain amount of time passes, this time seeming to be about a week.

@_date: 2018-03-14 19:55:16
It adds hashing protection. It’s basically a just in case security feature that would protect your coin if ECDSA was somehow compromised, say via quantum computing. If that happens, the attacker would have to find a hash collision of the pub key (or other valid pub key), then knowing the valid pubkey, reverse the ECDSA pubkey function to get a private key.
Of course you reveal your pubkey when spending, but if you haven’t spent from that address before, changes of them reversing the pubkey derivation function before your transaction confirms when spending it are very low.
It’s also for length and readability purposes, but other than that, ye.
Double hashing is done to prevent things called length extension attacks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:02

It's not horrible to reuse an address and you will be fine. There is just generally no reason not to use a new address. 
Reasons to not reuse addresses:
1. It gives you more privacy. Your bitcoin is split up among multiple addresses, each with no discernible link between them. No one can tell how much total bitcoin you have.
2. It technically gives you more cryptographic protection. But it is worth noting that it is just insane cryptographic protection multiplied by insane cryptographic protection, in the end, even without this added protection, no one in a million years will be able to steal your bitcoin. Note that this cryptographic protection is maintained until you spend bitcoin from that address. Sending bitcoin to this address multiple times will not remove this added protection. It's also worth noting that this added protection protects against quantum computers if they ever become a thing. The default protection does not. 
A solution here is however that you can have Bitcoin Core make many addresses for them and copy all those addresses to the USB drive. That way you can have a fresh address for every new transaction for the near future. If you run out, start up bitcoin core and make some new addresses once again.

That is wrong on many levels as to clearly haven’t done research on but let’s assume that it is true. That also means the efficiency of optimized solutions like ASICs grows exponentially at approximately the same rate. This means difficulty grows at the same rate as well, meaning that a) revenue to cost ratios stay the same, meaning loss of funds as currently people are losing funds from CPU mining, and b) revenue stays approximately the same.
Even electricity production optimization’s result in the same issue as that just means more ASICs can exist to mine profitably, resulting in higher difficulty once again.
In the end, you are only thinking exponentially when it is convenient for you. 
It’s a fools errand.

B) Following it, you can make a byte which denotes the byte size of what you want to store in the blockchain (up to 40 bytes) and then the data you want to store.
It is not possible to only have that transaction with OP_Return output in it. Someone must pay the miner fee and I don’t believe Bitcoin allows for transactions to be inputless. 
There are other ways to store stuff in the blockchain, such as sending a satoshi to an address with your desired hash, but these ways would make you an asshole to the rest of the network since you are adding a permanent UTXO to the blockchain that needs to be tracked by all nodes, while OP_Return marks the output as unspendable therefore not a UTXO.
That said, OTS is far more efficient due to it merkle rooting everything and not requiring you to pay a fee. Use it instead if you can.

Both parties must consent to run a channel. If one doesn’t consent and the other goes with it anyways, they would effectively trap their bitcoin in a channel with you and you could probably negotiate to basically extort half or so of it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:18:26
Well, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from sending your bitcoin to a multi sig contract to another person with or without their permission. Of course for a lightning channel, permission is preferred since that gets the other party to sign a refund transaction before the initial transaction is published, meaning the multisig can be refunded at any time. 
But if someone signs a multisig contract with you, you can basically extort them out of some coin in it by refusing to sign a refund transaction unless that transaction also sends some to yourself.

Take control of your bitcoin if you do not plan on trading it back to fiat in the near future. Don't hold it on coinbase. Holding it on coinbase means that you do not own bitcoin, you own an IOU for Bitcoin.
Download a Bitcoin wallet like Electrum, **back up your wallet seed to safe locations to not lose your Bitcoin**, and send your Bitcoin from Coinbase to your Electrum wallet. You can even uninstall the software at this point because your Bitcoin will be safe and secure so long as you have your seed.

Sure prices go up when there is instability. This is not guaranteed to continue for a full collapse though. People begin to hoard actually useful things during such an event, tools, food, land, and water, instability hoarding is just to protect investments, collapse hoarding is to protect yourself.

Are you trying to say that no one ever buys high and sells low? 
Markets in fact rely on the existence of such people. Price goes up when more people buy than sell, price goes down when more people sell than buy. It is effectively a zero sum game. To make a profit, someone else is guaranteed to make a loss, especially in the long run. 
The smarter person wins generally. Issue is that you have idiots losing out and idiots are the ones that make the biggest fuss about losing. 
HODLers lose out on unrealized gains, but generally as long term holders they still net a profit. They are less likely to complain.
Also most traders don’t know what a private key is. Many a time people have lost money because they just wanted to get rich quick and not understand the basic underlying principles here. This leads to money loss.
Lastly, traders are more likely to buy into bitconnect.

If the Lightning default option will be to randomly connect to the least populous "intermediary" node, then probably not. But even if it is, this is different from card companies since it is still trustless. You need to trust your card company, you do not need to trust lightning.

~~Hmm, it spent the reward from block 9. That could indeed be Satoshi, I would imagine that at most a dozen people had the client at that time, probably far less than 5. It is also worth noting that there wasn't even a transaction until block 170 beside the coinbase transactions.~~
Edit: Am dumb, that is just random people giving small amounts of bitcoin to early bitcoin addresses. Those are not outgoing transactions, they do not involve satoshi making/needing them. It probably is Satoshi's address though.

No. Sadly ECDSA is only a signature algorithm, not an encryption algorithm as well like RSA.

No. Finding blocks is how you earn LTC. For each block, you get 25 LTC. 
Alternatively, you can get together with a lot of other people and all mine together and have Bob take the rewards and split them depending on how much you mine daily. This is known as a pool, this way if you would normally mine to get 25 ltc every 25 days, the pool will likely get blocks more often and will be able to pay you 1 ltc a day instead.
It’s not additional.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:14:26
Those that aren’t scams mainly do it to lower risk. It is better to get stable cash up front than risk having fluctuating bitcoin prices in the future go down. So they ask others to pay for miners they run, in which case they get the cash they would get if they were to mine themselves for in the future (plus a bit of premium for setting up the mining) if bitcoin price was stable. That way they still profit a bit but the risk is all yours.

That is all something I am well aware of.
That depends on the point of view, if your point of view is that 2X is correct, then normal Bitcoin supporters are the ones who are anti-node. If I were a 2Xer, you would be the one anti-node.


Out of interest, have you ran a Lightning client before? It is no where near half baked. 
My support is conditional for both sides, as it stands, I currently do not support 2X since I believe in Lightning, but that may change as time moves on. The greatest evidence of this is that I run a Core node, not any other node. I have voted, but I understand that my vote is not finalized and can be changed in the future, which is what I am doing. 
I do wish that 2X was set back a bit given recent developments, but either way, Lightning will be ready before then, I have seen it myself. 
Patience is a virtue, but patience is not unlimited. 
My point in all of this is that if you want to defeat 2X, the best way to do this is to show Lightning works, nothing more, nothing less. And there is plenty of time for a non-rushed Lightning.

For future record, this graph is the easiest way to figure out the proper fee if you can interpret it right.
Take a look at the bottom graph. About the top 1.3 will be removed every 10 minutes, assuming none are added. If your transaction has the fee there, it will probably be confirmed quickly.

So you bought 5 S9s without understanding the basics of how mining works... really?
The more computational power in the network, the faster solutions to the bitcoin mining problem are found, this should be logical. But it is important to keep block times at mostly 10 minutes. So every 2016 blocks, the difficulty of the bitcoin mining problem is increased by basically the following scheme.
current difficulty * ((600 * 2016)/(timestamp of most recent block - timestamp 2016 blocks ago).

@_date: 2018-04-11 08:13:59
Well, a public key can be public info, with digital signing algorithms alone (like ECDSA, not RSA since that is also useful for encryption), a hash of the public key is just more secure because hashing algorithms are a little more iffy. 
After the first transaction from an address, the pubkey for it is public information. This address can be reused but loses the protections of a hashing algorithm which is not a really big deal for now but if someone finds a flaw in ECDSA, at least most of us can hide behind hashes to protect us.
OP checksig exists to check the signature of course, you can make a transaction that claims to have the pubkey with the corresponding hash and a signature, but in reality has an invalid signature for that pubkey. Or alternatively, hacker intercepts transaction and changes the output address. Op_Checksig prevents this from allowing users to steal coins, as in the first example the validation fails because bullshit signature and in the second it fails because the data signed is not the same anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:43:17
Probably not, but it is connected to a node run by whatever your mining pool is. If you were to solo mine, you would need to have a computer running a node. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:38:48
All over the world. Its a network, essentially a massive game of telephone (but the internet doesn't corrupt data as easily). Your ledger connects to some bitcoin node either run by ledger or someone else, who takes that transaction, checks its validity, then passes it on. Eventually it reaches a miner who will place it in a block and send that block out just the same way. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:43:28

@_date: 2018-04-30 07:49:04
Note its not a simple change in formatting, the transaction type is different as well, native pay to witness pubkey hash instead of the normal pay to pubkey hash and script wrapped segwit transactions that we were using earlier.
Main difference is that it saves a few bytes over Pay to Script Hash segwit (the segwit addresses starting with a 3).
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:41:34
Miners run nodes just like normal users do. They just also have their miners connected to said nodes using Bitcoin Core's RPC calls to take data from the node and in case they find a block, publish that block.

Unless the miners willingly choose to create one, which can occur due to them wanting their block to be accepted faster than a bigger block (due to limited network propagation), or miners coming together to boycott smaller fees since they want larger ones to be made. Both work hand in hand.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:29:31
The flaw in your logic is that many miners will not consider those 12.5 bitcoins they get on the segwit chain as valid/will be influenced if the segwit coins aren't considered valuable. What is the point of mining on the easy chain if it won't be worth anything after the fork fails? Waste of hashpower.
In the end, you still rely on majority consensus. If that fails, congrats, you split the chain.

Except that requires a change in the escrow transaction requiring both signatures to increase fees.

Transactions are anonymous. Conversion is not. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:59:44
Might as well begin with a whole explanation just for context. Also somewhat trying to verify 
Lightning Network channel operation:
Alice wants to make a channel with Bob. 
Step 1: Alice makes a transaction locking her bitcoin (say 3 bitcoin) into an escrow account with Bob, both signatures will be required to spend bitcoin found in this account. Alice will keep this TX secret until step 2, she mainly needs its TXID for step 2 (this TXID is also why this cannot work with transaction malleability).
Step 2: Alice makes a transaction for this escrow account which returns her bitcoin to her, but can only be published after x time, let’s say that is thirty days (a timelocked transaction). Since this is an escrow account, she requires Bob’s signature, she will send this transaction to Bob, who will sign it because he wants to open this Lightning channel and there is no penalty for him. Once getting the signed timelocked transaction, Alice will publish the TX from step 1. 
Step 3: If Alice wants to send 0.5 bitcoin to Bob. She will make a transaction to this escrow account that returns 2.5  bitcoin to her and gives 0.5 to Bob, but can be only published in 29 days (a day or so before the limit of the previous TX). Bob isn’t going to refuse bitcoin, so he signs it. Now, this transaction will be published first and the original 30 day return TX will be considered invalid when published.
This is the beauty of the Lightning Network, two transactions for each channel which can have thousands many updates between them before they close. Bob can send Alice 0.1 Bitcoin the same way and have a 28 day timelock.
This system relies on the latest transaction being published first, this uses timelocks to ensure this, but say Alice is greedy and the network is clogged, Bob publishes the 29 day transaction to the blockchain and tries to get it in, but fails because clogged network, 30 days pass and Alice decides to publish the original transaction, returning all bitcoin in the channel to her. Problem is that the 29 day transaction was considered final the moment it was signed by Alice, unlike the current system, where bitcoin is final when it is on the blockchain. I see no failsafe against this, hell, I’d go as far as to say that the only thing that will protect against this is an unlimited blocksize. So basically, such an attack would reverse bitcoin transactions, not reject one like current double spend attacks do.

Somewhat interested then, have been on the edge in all of this debate.
How does a Lightning Network not be centralized? From my understanding of it, it will in the end consist of centralized nodes simply because it is impossible to open up a channel with every single user. 
I have yet to find a convincing argument for this and honestly it seems like a greater centralization risk than big blocks. Because from my understanding, being the largest mediator of the Lightning Network is the end goal of Blockstream.

Gold is only a hedge against the market because people think it is a hedge against the market.
I see a generational shift coming in these next few decades where this will become less true as more realize this, the price will drop. Currencies keep their value because they at least have some utility in barter and they are generally not held as investments. And any digital currency can easily take the place of "hedge against the market."
Gold is garbage. I would not touch it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:05:25
A bit late, but I am back after some research and thinking with two more concerns about this that I hope you can put to rest.
Firstly, back to centralization, a channel locks a certain amount of funds, and no more than that can be transferred between the parties in those channels. This means that if I want to send 1 bitcoin to Bob, I need to find a chain of channels which already have at least 1 BTC locked in them from the sending end of the channel. Once a bitcoin is locked in the channel, it cannot be used in other channels until the channel closes.
My fear is that this effectively centralized the LN because only the wealthy will have the sheer amount of bitcoin needed to open a channel with millions of users. I can only imagine exchanges have this amount, resulting in significant centralization. I did not see that article covering this aspect of an LN, they gave all users equal amounts of bitcoin in the LN with relatively tiny transactions.
And secondly, my fear is that what happens with a clogged blockchain? Currently, that just rejects some transactions, but if you clog the blockchain with time-locked contracts, you need them published to the blockchain now, not later, to avoid transactions getting reversed well after they are considered confirmed. What protection is there against this?
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:35:58
Hmm, the SHA3 competition is over. Guess I should edit the article to fix that.

Ethereum does use orphan blocks to secure the blockchain, and miners get rewarded for it.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:07:09
Problem is the Bitcoin system has a limitation that stops scaling to such high transaction rates as now. As a result, there is a bit of a fee bidding war to get your transaction confirmed. People are attempting fixes to this, we will see how it turns out.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:51:27
Hmm, miners decided not to signal segwit until an option to add a 2 MB hard fork came about. Maybe, just maybe, the majority of miners want a 2 MB hard fork? Ever thought of it that way.
It is worth noting that they are not signaling for segwit, they are signaling for segwit plus HF.
Though I honestly want to see UASF to happen simply to watch it fail spectacularly.

Sigh, how many times does this have to be explained.
The average is high because contract execution is more costly than a simple transaction. Far more transactions happen than contracts, so go find the median fee and you will see it is at most a couple cents. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:43:28
Ah, this actually made me dig into the rabbit hole a bit, I didn't realise the purpose of hash contracts before this. I assumed that the system was not trustless because of that.
It is actually a very interesting system actually.
But even so, looking at that link, yes it does seem possible to make such a network, but is it feasible/will it happen? It just seems that users will naturally choose the easiest path for them to take, which leads to centralization here. Either way, I do like the idea of a Lightning Network now. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:52:57
So it in of itself is not an exploit, it is just bad for the bitcoin network because someone patented it, leading to centralization. 
But by extension, you are effectively arguing that the entire proof of work system is flawed because of the existence of ASICs. ASICs were satoshi's flaw here, not ASICBOOST. Either way, seems like other coins like Ethereum have solved that problem.


Companies dislike substantial risks, yes they could mine with the asic and offset costs used to produce that asic, but that largely relies on a stable bitcoin price. It is better to diversify your holdings and in this way, that is what these companies are doing. You can get a guaranteed 400 million for your miners or risk it based on bitcoin's price and earn $450 million or get $20 million only if bitcoin's price plummets.

You need to realize that exchanges are essentially the most important party here, like it or not, your bitcoin is linked to fiat and the harder it is to convert, the less useful and by extension, less costly it becomes.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:43:37
Ehh, not really. The reason BTC hashrate is so high is because ASICs have much much higher hashrate than normal graphics cards used to mine eth, and you cannot build an asic for Ethereum that gives as much gains in terms of hashrate as Ethereum. In this sense, bitcoin can be attacked by an individual that has a ton of asics, but cannot be attacked by a supercomputer, while the reverse is true in ethereum, it is vulnerable to supercomputer attacks but not ASIC attacks.
Though it is worth mentioning that you will need a significantly more powerful computer than anything currently in existence to attack Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:03:03
I see it as an efficiency in the proof of work process which would be absolutely harmless had it not been patented. What harm comes of ASICBOOST that is not a direct result of its parent? The inherent fact of proof of work is that even cheating it is fine so long as everyone cheats, in which case there will still be a proportional amount of work done from all sides.
Companies and individuals still like to diversify their risk, this is what asic producing companies do. Investor 101, never put your eggs all in one basket.
Anyways, now that I am interested, would you support an Ethereum style asic resistant proof of work algorithm to be forked into bitcoin?

1. Just clarifying, you are asking for why hash collisions or public key collisions do not occur in bitcoin? If so, a bit surprised you don't know this as a sysadmin.
Yes, there can be hash and public key collisions in where either two different users generate the same public private key pair randomly or two different sets of data produce the same hash randomly. But let's just say that the chances are astronomically small, if that ever happens.
Considering that each possible RIPEMD hash is a equally random number between 0 and 2^160 , the chance of this is one in 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 for each attempt. It just won't happen. Private public keypairs and SHA256 are even more secure. 
Also, mind clarifying your second question, a bit confused as to what you mean by redundant address.

Ethereum ASICs are pointless when memory acts as the bottleneck in ethash. Doesn't matter how fast your ASIC chips are when it has to wait on RAM to grab slices of the DAG file. And I doubt ASIC companies can compete with NVIDIA or AMD in this aspect. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:24:29
No it's not flawed, it's only flawed to you because you view it as a flaw. Cryptographically speaking, nothing about ASICBOOST risks the security of SHA256. It simply makes the algorithm faster by predetermining values of static parts of the dataset. Yes, this would make a brute force attack faster, but so does an ASIC (and by orders of magnitude compared to a measly 20%). Beside, virtually all hashing algorithms are prone to this, probably the SHA3 that Ethereum uses as well (though the sheer complexity of ethash makes the gains from it likely small).
There is also nothing about ASICBOOST that risks the creation of further risks to SHA256 like this. You should be more worried about quantum computers than ASICBOOST leading to anything.
Honestly, this is like saying a gear shift in a car is a flaw in physics. 


But some eggs are less at risk of breaking than others. Say bitcoin fails, all their mining profits go to shit, no one is buying their asics anymore, at the very least, they still have the money from selling asics before, making up for the future profits they lost from if they were to mine instead.

@_date: 2017-06-25 05:06:53
They still use it to secure the blockchain. If an orphan is mined, its hash can be added to block up to 7 block heights in the future, in which case, the miner who mined the orphan and the miner who added the orphan to their block get rewarded.
This is used since blockchain consensus is set by the "heaviest" chain as in the one with the most blocks, rather than the longest chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:50:21
So would that be a hard fork then?
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:06:37
Interesting. If that is the case, does bitcoin not have the ability to create such a peg? According to rootstock's website, they do require a trusted third party for the peg, for now at least.
Would you support a fork to get this peg to be trustless?
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:40:30
Gonna somewhat answer questions though not directly initially, rather going to explain how it works in friendlier terms that should contain the answers.
Proof of Work essentially works on the concept of finding a hash less than a certain value, known as the target. Since an SHA256 hash is essentially a pseudo random value between 0 and 2^256 - 1, a good way to ensure computational complexity is by requiring that the hash of a set of data is below . Since there is no way to produce such a value beside guess and check, it acts as a puzzle that can only be solved by brute force, while anyone can verify the solution to that puzzle and by extension verify that it probably required a certain amount of work, at least on average. The 0 bits Satoshi refers to are the leading 0 bits in the hash, since the hash is below the target.
The data being hashed in this case is known as the block header, which consists of 4 bytes for version number, generally only used to communicate about what most of the computational power supports in terms of changing bitcoin protocol, the hash of the previous block header being mined on, used to link this new block to the one being mined on, merkle root hash, essentially a special hash linking all the transaction in the block to the block header, a unix time  a 4 byte nBits value, which is primarily used to declare how many leading 0 bits there are in the hash/what the target is, then a 4 byte nonce value, which can be randomly changed to influence the hash of the header. 
Now, how is target found?
The target is computed every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks worth) based on the time stamp found in the header. The average difference between time stamps should equal 600, or 10 minutes. If this is lower than that, the target is decreased, making it harder to find a block, this making the block time longer. If the time is over 10 minutes, the target is increased, having the opposite effect. Target and difficulty are different values used for different but in essence refer to this same referred to in different ways. The specific calculations for this can be found on the wiki.
So why is all this done?
This is done to have everyone agree on the correct blockchain, thus the correct balance for everyone using bitcoin, since it stores all transactions. If you have multiple blockchains downloaded/forks (blockchains where multiple blocks refer to the same previous block), how do you verify which single chain is correct?
By checking that all of them follow bitcoin rules and then selecting the longest chain, which should be the chain requiring the most computation, meaning the one most proof of work participants (called miners) worked on.
In case of a fork, where two blocks appear that link to the same previous block, miners can work on either one, the tie breaker is decided by which blockchain is longest in the future, so essentially the next blocks act as a tie breaker. Theoretically, the first block successfully mined should be the one which propagates through the network the most, therefore miners will mine on the first one they receive. Miners want to mine on the longest chain since they will be rewarded with bitcoin if they find a solution on that chain, all solutions found on forks, also called orphaned blocks, are not rewarded. 
The reward itself is the ability to craft a transaction in the successfully mined block which generates bitcoin out of thin air. Initially they were allowed to generate a reward of 50 bitcoin, but that is halved every 4 years. Currently, the reward is 12.5 bitcoin. They also add onto this by taking any fees that transactions in the block have. The hope is that these transactions will fund miners completely in the future as the block reward itself decreases.
Miners follow all these rules because otherwise the rest of the network doesn't agree on the block, therefore they don't agree that the miner earned the reward.
So, now specific quick question answers.
1/2: The valid block headers in the block chain require a hash with a certain number of 0 bits in front of it. This is done to ensure that it is difficult to create a block like this, since a hash is a random number between 0 and 2^256 - 1 . This forces people who want to add onto the blockchain to do computational work.
3: Difficulty isn't exactly the number of 0 bits that a hash must have before it, but it refers to that number. Check the wiki for difficulty and target calculations for the exact formula.
4/5: You shouldn't have to store alternatives, only the longest chain. If a proof of work contributor wants the reward associated with making a block on a block fork (not the longest chain) and thinks they can mine faster than the rest of the network, they will keep those orphaned blocks until/if they can create the longest chain, in which case they will broadcast all those blocks to collect their reward. Users can delete orphan blocks once they believe they are unlikely to be in the longest chain. If that happens in the unlikely situation, they request the network for it.
6/7: 
A client knows they received a block for which they don't know the previous block if the hash of the previous block header, included in the block they received, doesn't match the hash of any block they have. In this case, they can request the network to send a block with that hash. This is also a way in which the newest block can be used to validate the entire blockchain, use that block to get the hash of he previous block, and any source sending you the previous block can be checked for validity by checking its hash. By doing that, you come into knowledge of the hash of the block before the one you just received and you can repeat the process.
8: Every 4 years (technically every 210,000) the amount of bitcoin a miner can generate out of thin air is halved. The reward of mining primarily consists of this along with all the fees attached to transactions in the mined block. This is the incentive for mining. Satoshi is saying that there will eventually be a total amount of bitcoin and as a result, inflation will not occur since no new bitcoin will be made. Incentives are not tied to difficulty, if the difficulty becomes large enough or bitcoin's value drops to the point where it isn't profitable to mine, some miners will stop mining and as a result, the difficulty decreases and makes it profitable for the remaining miners. 
9: Transactions contain inputs, which are earlier transactions giving someone bitcoin, which they are spending in this transaction. They also contain outputs, bitcoin addresses (public keys) which receive the bitcoin specified by the transaction. The total amount of bitcoin in the inputs must be completely spent, but since you can have multiple outputs, you can send yourself the "change" for said input. 
What satoshi is mainly referring here is the ability to delete used inputs from the blockchain. Transactions are tied to the block header through a merkle root hash, which is the hash of combined hashes of transactions. The idea is that once a transaction is used, it can be deleted in the blockchain so long as its hash remains in the blockchain, thus decreasing blockchain size. Since that transaction was checked to have valid inputs in the past and verified since people mined the chain containing that transaction, it is effectively verified without needing to contain the transaction itself.
Ask if you need clarification.

Yes, those are those orphan blocks used to secure the blockchain.
Essentially they are orphaned blocks which are later "declared" in the blockchain by a future block that has a higher block height, in return for which the miner of the uncle block gets a smaller block reward and the miner of the block which declared the uncle block gets an additional bonus for adding in the uncle block. An uncle block can only be added into a block whose blockheight is at most 7 blocks from the blockheight of the uncle, so you can't mine blocks from a year ago and add them onto the blockchain for a reward.
This is done because the in bitcoin, the longest chain is considered the correct chain but in ethereum, the "heaviest chain" as in the one with the most blocks, is considered the longest chain.
This is why some argue that the ethereum blockchain is more secure than the bitcoin one.

You keep acting like you are the majority when you are not. This agreement has managed to get more people to signal for segwit in a few days than core in years. 
This is true with node count as well, likely especially when the segwitx2 client is complete.
You are the minority and yet you still don't realize it. It is honestly funny to watch. Most "users" just want a solution and they view this as a compromise on both fronts and as such will support it. These aren't obsessions over bitcoin like you or the r/btc lot, they just want the most usable bitcoin they can get in the short term, which will be the hard forked 2 MB chain and the chain that doesn't have 1 hour block times for a month after the fork.
Will be switching my node to the X2 client as soon as it is ready/when I feel like it before the fork. Meanwhile you can go fork yourself off to your altcoin, have fun ranting about how you are using "real Bitcoin" while the rest of the world moves onto the other chain.
