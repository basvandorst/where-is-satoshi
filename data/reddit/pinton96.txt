If all the bitcoin has been mined (21 million, correct me if I am wrong), this means there will be no more incentive for people to verify transaction ? Will it limit the transaction of bitcoin ? Since people have no reason to verify the transaction.

What’s this halving thing? How will it affect Bitcoin price ?

Cool, appreciate the explanation. Will halving discourage bitcoin miners and eventually affect the transaction speed? Since the reward is getting lesser and might demotivate people to verify the transaction.
Do other coins like ether, ripple, ada, iota, etc have halving as well ?

Ok, in future, as the blockchain is getting bigger and bigger, we need larger storage to store all the transaction data. This means  if the entire world population is adopting bitcoin, we (those participate in the network) have to keep purchasing external storage in order to store the increasing transaction data ?
And as far as I understand, the max supply of bitcoin is 21 million, and to compete a transaction, we need a ‘miner’ to verify every  transaction. What happen if the max supply is reached, means there will be no more miner, and all transactions can’t complete ?

The blockchain is stored on many computers..does this mean that the blockchain is segregated, and stored differently ? E.g. 100 GB hosted by 10 computers, so each computer store 10 GB..? If  no one wants to host the blockchain anymore, this means the blockchain (bitcoin) will die off ? The success of it depends on how many ppl willing to become the network operator ?

Yea, unlike other investment instruments such as property, stock, bond, etc, bitcoin don’t create wealth..maybe it is much similar to gold and silver.I think the price won’t increase further like it used to be, but will stabilise over time and becomes less volatile, so it can serve its purpose as a currency rather than an asset.

Bitcoin is initially designed to be a decentralised, digital currency, not an asset. It is the hype and craze that drive up the price...
