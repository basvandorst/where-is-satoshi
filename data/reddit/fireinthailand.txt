Articles in the media say this USD ETN started trading on Aug. 15h, but I can't find anything about it on the xbtprovider website and it doesn't show up in my broker's contract search (Interactive Brokers). Coinshare's Twitter feed doesn't have anything and searching on the Nasdaq Nordic's website doesn't show anything either. 
As far as I'm concerned it's completely unavailable for trading.
Advantages of a bitcoin ETN are numerous - don't have to worry about your own wallet or private keys, price is based on an average of multiple exchanges, it holds real bitcoin, and you can buy it directly in your stock brokers account so there's no need to worry about getting your money out of some fly-by-night crypto exchange. 
I can see how anyone investing a large amount of money would consider the risks of an ETN in a well established brokerage account far less than putting their money on small exchanges that have a history of getting hacked and making withdrawals difficult. The 2.5% annual fee of the ETN is less than what some crypto exchanges charge per transaction.

To me, dollar cost averaging is buying more every month when I get paid regardless of price.

Most people who try to sell before the next market crash end up selling at the wrong time and miss out on huge gains. Don't forget you also have to know when to get back in, so you have to be right twice. If you know how to do this consistently you could sell your system and retire a billionaire.  
The best way is dollar cost averaging into a diversified portfolio that crypto is a part of.

I hear your points, but you're taking a very extreme one-sided view and being ridiculous - everyone in the world needs to spend one year to understand the new money so they can make basic purchases?  Do you hear what you're saying?
Yes, you don't like banks. We get that. But you fail to recognize any of the benefits that banks provide while also not acknowledging any of the disadvantages to storing your bitcoin.
TBH, I don't want to imagine what society would be like when everyone has their entire life savings either at home or in their memory. That sounds like a huge step backwards to the stone age where anyone who's bigger can walk into your "house" and take whatever they want, only with bitcoin they can take everything. Mass home invasions will be the result. 
At least acknowledge the benefits of custodial services and try to understand why many people don't want to store their own crypto.

“No one said when some of these early-stage Internet companies in 2000 were going out of business, ‘Gee, the Internet is toast,’” Jessop said.  “We don’t focus too much on the price. It’s a foundational technology —  people are trying to get exposure to the trend and expect volatility in the assets themselves.”

But any American with an Interactive Brokers account can buy XBT on the Swedish Nasdaq with just a few clicks.
I also don't understand why it's taking the US SEC so long to approve a BTC ETF.

The problem with his statement is it's written in the present tense.
Cryptocurrencies are the future.

Great find!
I remember talking with my uncle about gold back around 2001. The dot-com bubble had burst and the internet was now common. All the experts were saying gold is old-fashioned and it's not needed anymore in the digital economy. Everyone in investing circles though it was dead.
Fast-forward to the 2008 financial crisis and gold came back to life.
Lesson learned - the time to buy is when everyone says it's done and sell when everyone says it's the future.

Thanks. I got that to work.
