27000 pages of tax code, yeah I would say it is a bit confusing.

Quick question on SAR, is that only for international stuff.  Or could something like coinbase cause it to be triggered as well?  Just wondering on how that works.  Thanks for the great info!

Another reason why I prefer coinbase.  While they may not be under all of the regulations banks are, it is still safer than using a foreign exchange.

I know some solo lawyers that use yahoo email for their work.  IK its a scam, but just saying it pretty common.

Just buy some BTC, unless you are willing to drop 6k on a 2th miner that will not even ship until april (probably more like next june), then I would just buy some btc.

It will rebound in a week or so, once people buy in low.  The problem right now is people are using bitcoin as a short term investment trying to make a few bucks.  Not many people are actually buying products with them.

Like back in my runescape days.  The biggest queston of all was how to pronounce it.  run-escape, rune-scape, runes-cape, or runescape.  I think run-escape is the proper term for it because you need to get out before you get hooked on it lol.

I want to see an ebay type site with escrow.  You sell the items, and they hold them until the buyer approves the items or after 14 days, the seller gets the funds.  Someone like you with access to a legal team would have to do this though because you would have to have very strict guidelines on how the selling works.  Apparantly, there was a site that did this, but it was bought by another company and shut down.  I think that this would be huge for BTC because of the hatred that everyone has for ebay/paypal and there incentives to always side with the buyer.

I also have not had any problems with bter.com.  I left cryptsy when it took them 10 hours to deposit my funds.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:05:52
That would make sense, or someone who owns a large amount of stock in ebay.

Someone explained it to me very well like this.  If you in something that has the potential for 50% profit margins, there is a good chance that you have the potential for 50% losses too.

As long as you live in an area where a few places accept bitcoin, I don't see a problem.  But if you live in an area that doesn't it will be hard to order everything online.

I don't really understand what attack the network means.  Would an example be someone trying to put "fake" coins into the network?
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:08:00
Honestly, I would put it in an altcoin like protoshare or XPM, those have the chance to explode in a few weeks, and the potential to make more money.

not even worth mining.  We are in the THash now.

Some people speculate that it can handle the trades, but in order to keep BTC artificially high, they won't let them go through.  
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:25:33
why 3-5 hours?
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:09:30
Here is how you get them interested.  Tell them about ALTcoins, and how their super gaming rigs can mine them for profit.  They will be all over that.  Then they will have to figure out that BTC is the main currency, and you will have them all loving btc.

One of the major advantages to a corporation.  You also are not liable for anything that happens to your company.  Meaning that they can't sue you, they can only sue your company.  (If I understand it correctly, please tell me if I am wrong).

I guess I need to hire you to proof read my reddit comments :p

He would get his money back if he sued.  Most likely a letter to coinbase will get the ball moving rather quickly because they know even if they could win in court it would be terrible for PR.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:49:50
what do you use?  I may switch because the graphs never work, I always go to cryptsy to view graphs.

The xbox reboot loop, and the waterproof iphone were good too.  Like the other guy said, if you fall for this, then you deserve it.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:27:46
Ahh that makes sense, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:25:06
If they are delivered in on time.  But even if it is 2 months late, it will still turn a profit after a month of use.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:08:43
Can they at least hire someone to proof read their letters?  Even if I did fall for it, I am no sure that I could follow the directions.
EDIT: spelling :(

Nothing is stopping you, but you would have to be quick, coinbase would not be good for this because it takes a few days to get your coins, you would need a instant trading option to get this to work.
