Bitcoin is gonna pop soon. The system just isn't designed to handle this much traffic. I believe that it will take every other coin with it, even ones with better tech like eth or iota. This will cause all these people just buying in to jump ship and we will be back at sub 200 tmc. I am a student so I was only able to invest .5 worth or btc and alts  in july. Have made ~2.5x my initia investment and i plan on taking my initial investment out. How much you have doesnt have any impact on if you take profits out though and im confused how u would even argue this. If you have one btc worth of btc and alts and are hoping to keep it until you get some obscene amount like OP then you will end up with less long term.

Your mindset is flawed. No one is gonna be a millionaire from BTC anymore. You should look for profits relative to your investment.

Literally say im gonna do that in my post

what are you even trying to say? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:11:45
why are you even in this sub? just to piss people off?

Just by this sentence you show how clueless you are to crypto, I am happy to answer your questions but don't hate something because you don't understand it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:34
Surprised you haven't been banned yet tbh.

I agree with this comment, but XRB and IOTA are trying to achieve different things. XRB is P2p and IOTA is M2M

 bitcoin isn't just sending money back and forth instantly with no underlying rules. The complex system that was built involves a block (series of transactions, cryptographic hash of the previous block and cryptographic nonce). People (or companies now) with insanely powerful gpu's compete to solve a cryptographic function for a bitstring with a certain amount of zeros in the beginning using guess and check. As you can imagine this process using immense electricity so it is one of the reasons BTC is unsustainable IMO.  Once solves, they recieve a reward of 12.5 as of now but it halves every few years IIRC ( so limited supply of 21mil). In order to verify a transaction, you have to get a series of confirmations from a series of miners which essentially ensures that you are sending a legit bitcoin(block contains hash of previous block , hence a chain) so many excahnges/wallets won't accept btc without at least 2 confirmations which will take some time (not instantaneous).  As for the system being overloaded, I agree. There is a set limit of tx's per block of 1mb (~1000 tx's) so you need to insentivise miners to include your tx in their block, so naturally as more and more people send BTc you will have to pay more and more fees. 
So right now, btc is centralized which goes against the very fabric of what it was designed to be like and unscalable with power centralized in places where electricity is cheap, like china and indonesia.
As to venmo, I don't have it so and I don't know how it works, but as I understand it, you just pay money from a credit card into a balance and pay others using that balance. Essentially the same thing as putting money into paypal for instance. 
protip: going into a sub based on a subject and insulting that subject repeatedly with no knowledge on the subject is not a recipe for success.

Where is the "I'm a masochist" option

who gives a shit what this nutjob says

Look into NEO and IOTA as well. And why on earth would anyone buy ETC over ETH?
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:58:17
Look into IOTA

I might get downvoted for saying this on a bitcoin sub, but as of right now bitcoin isn't a great option for any use other than holding it as a 'digital gold'. The main problem with BTC atm is the amount of transactions that come with BTC getting more mainstream is far more than original system was designed to handle. The 1mb block size can contain only about 1000 tx's per block. Because of this, essentially to pay miners a fee to include your tx in their block. With larger amounts, this is less of a problem because the fee will be naturally be large. But if you try to send $5 in bitcoin to pay for a meal, you will pay $4 to the miners as a fee to include your tx in their block. in short, it is incredibly expensive to move BTC around but holding it in  one wallet is obviously paying dividends right now. 
 The main proponent that bitcoin has is first mover advantage. Essentially, the problems that bitcoin has won't matter in the long run because of how known/sought after bitcoin is right now. It is the oldest crypto and probably the most profitable to own long term. This coupled with the fact that it is the only way to buy most other cryptos means that it is here to stay.
If you are interested in learning more about other Cryptos that don't struggle with these problems, then I suggest reading up on @_date: 2017-07-21 00:25:51

Breadwallet would suffice for Aug 1 then correct?

Sorry can you explain this further.
I'm very new to BTC
