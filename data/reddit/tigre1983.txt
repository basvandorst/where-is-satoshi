Your cost basis is zero on bcash, so short term gain of 2k each or whatever you sell at if you sell it now. It's terrible for taxes.

And a slippery slope, if the irs goes easy, more forks will happen.

Your link is interesting. It would be great if the irs goes the direction of inherited property or gifted property, however there are many articles who say different, and some even say it's income tax the moment you receive it, even if you don't sell any! (worst case). I guess we need the irs to clarify.

That is because she lived during 10% annual inflation during the 70s and early 80s. They learned their lesson. No young people talk about it. 3% is goldilocks for this shadow tax.

Two things I think make inflation attractive to world leaders:
Most people don't understand it. They understand taxes, and tax rates or tax increases. They don't understand inflation, thus its a political freebie for governments to pay off debt with inflation. If they had to reduce spending or increases taxes to pay for debt it would be a political nightmare. Inflation is a silent tax. 
Second, $raises$, because people don't have a sure grip on inflation they don't really know if $45k a year is more or less than $40k in 2010. Everyone knows burgers used to be. 25 cents in the 1950s and they now cost dollars, but it's abstract. However, they do know if they get raises or not, and when the last time they got one.  The voting block would riot if wages are flat (not inflation adjusted, just simply flat). Inflation gives people a sense they are moving up, making more, doing well compared to their parents, etc. A world without inflation is a world without raises unless promotion, and a world that makes comparison to the past living standards obvious. Inflation is like a lubricant that keeps everyone churning away without riot. For example:
"I got a raise, my house is worth more than I bought it for and my 401k is up this year and I didn't pay more in taxes to the damn government!"
Even if that person is 'flat' when adjusting for inflation, they are not kicking the current administration out.

I have been in since 2013. Bought and sold on nearly all platforms and many exchanges. I now only use cash app because it's simple and easy to dca, and they only support btc, and that to me is key. Also, less risky than foreign exchanges or companies that support many alt coins, as those exchanges are a security risk. Cash app is better than Robinhood because on cash app you can pull your coins to your own wallet if you want.

Its OK, if it's just a vehicle to get them to your wallet, fine. I just don't like to support them, and worry their support of all the other chains opens more attack vectors. Cash app to Wasabi,

Sums up the long veiw thesis well.

Let me explain why this is HUGE, at least for me.
I have about $5k I put into a ROTH IRA a few years ago. Typical index fund. You cant really do anything with the money in that ROTH till retirement, and I am now at the point where I can't contribute anymore to my ROTH.
My ROTH will be worth whatever I bought it for + market returns X years from now. They joy of the ROTH is that it will be 100% tax free in gains now and distributions when I retire.
Bitcoin is the ONLY thing I think has a 10% chance of going parabolic between now and when I retire. I have not up till this moment been able to put BTC in my ROTH.
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
