yes, the price probarbly moved to quickly back then, mtgox also went under, so there where many reasons for the fall.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:20:33
Market crashed hard after that jump. And had a bearmarket for years after that

Miners arent the only ones controlling bitcoin.     
If they were, bitcoin wouldnt have segwit now
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:17:54
If its a centralized currency, why use blockchain at all?   
Could just be a database, much simpler

ok, semantics..  
Your definition of inflation I would just call loss of value.   
But your saying bitcoin will never be used for anything other than speculation?       
edit:   
Also that last part `Plus if coin settles at a high price, it will be risky to use and hold since anything that causes a dip in demand would cause massive inflation.`
sounds like that applies to any asset with a high marketcap..  
so anything with a high marketcap we should avoid ?
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:42:56


No its not, bitcoin wasn't any safer to hold when it was at a lower price

Its very hard to know when to buy and sell, and very easy to goof up, miss big rallies, get owned by bulltraps.. etc    
Historically hodl strategy has preformed very very good, unless you bought very recently, but hodl is a long\-term\-strategy.    
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:57:06
By inflation we mean increasing the supply of money.    
Most governments use inflation as a word for reduced buying power.    
But its volatile now because most people buying bitcoin atm do it for speculation.   
Hopefully in the future it will stabilize and be heavily used for other things.   
Also, bitcoin at the moment can be very anonymous if you know how.  
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:15:59
no matter how many people mine bitcoin, it will not increase the amount rewarded miners.   
currently 12.5 bitcoin is generated as reward to miners every block, which is every 10 minute.   
28 May 2020 that reward will be halved, and only 6.25 bitcoins will be rewarded every 10 minute.    
I would read the whitepaper, it looks a bit scary maybe, but its very simple english and not a long read.

Understanding the tech is the most important part of the hodl strategy.   But I don't see how that helps you in shortterm trading.    
And technical analysis is very much wishy washy science, but sure, you can hit the nail sometimes. Good luck anyways,

Why not just use bitpay if you want it in fiat?
If you want it in bitcoin, just run a fullnode and a trezor for cold wallet.
Havent had any problems with either, but im not a shop-- so I have pretty limited transaction count.

Wire transfer is not, international transactions are not.   
And most people cant process debit cards.    
   
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:30:00
The first paragraph you said there, that is exactly like an ICO(only much more unfair, in ICO's everyone who wants can invest)    
They set a initial price first, and investors buy.  
Then they release it on the markets later, and volatility ensues.     
But, if the marketcap gets big enough, to like the size of USD, the price would be very hard to move.      
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:41:43
Scaling solutions are coming..  
Segwit, ligtning network etc 
(And fees are about 0.5$ now)
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:29:39
Its about transaction capacity.  (transactions pr second)   
Here is a video from Andreas Antonopoulos about it:      
   
The video is about a month old now, so some of the scenarios he is talking about has already happened :p    
Segwit is now locked in on main chain, and bitcoin-cash  (    has been created which goes for big blocks tactics, and not segwit.    
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:51:14
I was oversimplifying, but, hmm, i kindof get what you mean.
It doesnt matter if you have a lot of money, If someone with a lot of power is out to get you.   
Wealth doesnt directly translate to power, someone with power could just kill you and take ur wealth, or fuck shit up for you.   
Also I agree a lot with the last argument, I am a big supporter of bitcoin for that reason.   
But you cant say money has zero power ? Look at Saudi Arabia, Quatar and all the oil nations..(and the cozy relationship between banks and government) But I think I was talking about wealth, but didnt really specify it .  
While you were talking about fiat ?
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:09:27
lol, yes it does, and money = power.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:05:43
Doesnt look instant at all: 
When will the funds arrive?
Money transfers usually within seconds to a PayPal account. Then, 2-4 days for withdrawal to a bank account.
But also, the point with decentralized cryptocurrency, is that you wont need any thirdparty.    
And sending a million dollar worth of currency with paypal would be a lot more expensive than with bitcoin. (paypal has 0.5% fee)    
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:20:07
How will they make a cryptocurrency that isnt volatile?  
Every new cryptocurrency is very volatile, because of small marketcap and a big influx of new users/investors.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:04:08
Yeah, hmm.
But what do you mean by power ?   
For instance, muncipalities in my country would very much like more rich people to pay taxes and invest in the local economy and corporations.   
And because of that, the muncipality would do a lot to get them there, overlook laws, let them come in front of others etc.      
And why would corporation spend money on lobbying, if they dont have to?   
Also organizations etc. spends money bribing leaders of countries to great successs.    
I think you have an interesting perspective(and pretty new to me), and would like to learn more about it, do you have any documentaries or books to recommend?    
   
I also dont get why lots of money dont create more money, for instance today, it almost doesnt matter where you put your fiat, almost everything goes up compared to fiat.   (assets/stocks/funds/bitcoin/etc.)     
And the more you have, the more fiat-gain from the investment, but if bitcoin became the world currency that would probarbly change a lot.   
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:37:16
Having reversible transactions is not impossible with bitcoin. Multisig with a counterparty for example. And second layer solutions.  
And who decides who gets their transaction reversed in fiat ?  (I dont really know, but it seems not all transactions are reversible atleast) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:41:45
What about debitcard ?   
Or wire transfer ?   
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:53:48
Please read up on lightning network
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:34:28
Research on renewable energy/ safe nuclear power/other tech that can help, costs a lot of resources.  
A bad economy probarbly wouldnt help
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:26:42
You can program chargeback layer on top of bitcoin. Its easier to program soft promises on top of hard promises, than hard promises on top of soft promises (that wont work)
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:14:35

That is where small transactions will go

@_date: 2017-09-28 21:31:27

bitcoin is more comparable to a protocol than to a OS.

What are they gonna do so great about it ?

Are there any alts as close as bitcoin is with second layer solutions ?  
Blockchain need second layer solutions to be really usefull in day 2 day usage.

Visa is not free, the merchant has to pay.  
And bitcoin is still improving, lightning network and second layer solutions will be a gamechanger.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:22:57
You can spend your bitcoin anywhere they accept visa. If you use xapo or similar service. 
Also almost every big city has bitcoin atm where you can change btc into local currency
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:43:07
Because on-chain transactions are not good for small transactions. But lightning network is coming soon, and that is good for small transactions, instant and very low fee
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:33:14
It is tho
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:38:41
Like the convenience wikileaks received?    
And all the unbanked in the world, (not saying bitcoin is ready to help all of them yet).   
But this is pretty cool

What is happening right now ?
Something that would be illegal if it was more regulated? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:22:27
I dont want to get into your other points right now.   
But Ive never said bitcoin cant crash, its crashed a lot of times, and will crash many more times, with varying intensity.   
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, software development is very slow, especially when working in brand new areas, like cryptocurrencies.    
If bitcoin still is alive in 10 years, it will be a completely different user experience, from what it is today, like the internet was in 1990 vs 2000 vs 2010 etc.   
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:38:52
Fiat systems are very much not uncensorable, and you have to ask for permission to accept e.g visa on your website, or your store.   
and they take quite a big fee, and can revoke the whole thing as they see fit.
Bitcoin can easily have reversible transactions programmed on top of it..   
You can easily program soft promises on top of hard one, but you can't program hard promises on top of soft ones.
Maybe one day you will understand more about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:48:01
theres a big difference between software and hardware
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:16:38
you don't see the value in programmable, borderless, near instant transaction, nearly no fee (lightning network), uncensorable, divisible currency,
where you don't have to ask anyone for permission?
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:06:20
bitcoin is much more than its code.   
its the infrastructure, support, network, users, etc..   
You can copy its code, but you can't copy that
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:32:20
like every growing asset, stock, etc, the first to buy and hold gets most profit..    
doesn't make it a pyramid scheme..   
bitcoin and the ecosystem is a lot more mature than it was back then.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:54:40
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:46:11


Because they believe it will, when fully blossomed help a lot of people.     
Like the internet and dot com bubble, it starts with investors trying to find out what its worth, while the technology evolves.       
And with open source protocols like http, torrent, tcp and bitcoin, where anyone can innovate, things can evolve very far.    
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:17:43
bitcoin has value backed by utility and services by the blockchain and in the ecosystem around it.   
Also a hardcoded limited supply.    
Its still early, lots of things in the pipeline, its an open protocol, open to innovation by anyone who wants, unlike fiat systems..     
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:01:07
Across some borders**(others are very hard and expensive, or nearly impossible), and bitcoins tx fee will only get better with time, e.g lightning network. Already a lot faster
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:24:46
Yes, I know what you mean, I dont use xapo for the reason you stated :)   
But if i lived only on bitcoin, I would use xapo or similar service.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:13:00
if you invest the money in funds etc and get 2.5% yearly ROI you could atleast have 125k$ a year without working.
@_date: 2016-10-01 20:40:16
well , everything tcp is client -&gt; server to be able to communicate.
But torrent is fundametally different from how google, youtube etc is working today.
Dont know much about openbazaar, but atleast they claim to be p2p.

You also have bitcoin atm's in bigger cities.
@_date: 2016-10-01 09:05:57
No, its mostly client -&gt; server.
While it could be p2p, like torrent, bitcoin, tox, openbazaar.
