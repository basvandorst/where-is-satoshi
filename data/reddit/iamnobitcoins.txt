Unless the blockchain can somehow be re-designed to scale far better (by orders of magnitude), offchain does seem the only viable option for larger volumes, including dealing with the kind of spam we're seeing now. Simply increasing the blockchain's capacity by raising the size limit only scales linearly; to achieve orders of magnitude increases in volume, it requires orders of magnitude increases in expenses in storage capacity and bandwidth, which is likely not sustainable at very high usage levels.
Shifting around numbers in a database is far simpler and consumes much less resources than publishing everything to the blockchain, giving offchain solutions much greater potential for scalability than the blockchain itself, but the blockchain can help keep such services, "honest", in their bookkeeping. Any service built on top of the blockchain is ultimately responsible to the public ledger; it can fudge its own books however it wants, but it can't trick the blockchain.
Of course it would be optimal if the blockchain was simply efficient enough to handle high volumes on its own, but unfortunately, this just isn't the case, and increasing the blocksize will not alleviate this. The way it looks now, letting external solutions compete to figure out what sticks might be the best remedy. 1MB probably isn't the perfect size for blocks, but keeping the blockchain lean makes it more accessible to work with and build on top of, which might prove to be very important going forward.
