I made a large profit during the run up this past bubble (you can check my post history regarding my post here and claiming the taxes on it).  I have since diversified my portfolio a bit, and I've taken some losses, but I pulled out my entire original investment after I made the big gain, so I am simply playing with house money from now on.

The reason he gave his address was because the website currently isn't working for bitcoin donations.  I'm sure that rule is more about people spamming for freebies than it is about stopping worthwhile charities from getting funding.

Since I need to pay my taxes and I can always amend if something changes.   All current wisdom taking to tax professionals (and common sense) led me to believe this was the proper way to file at the moment.   Can it change? Sure.   It can change next year or the year after as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:40:33
Yeah, I sold all my coins and took profit at around 1000 USD during the initial run-up.  I was thinking it would go back down, and I really needed the money for house renovations so it was just a perfect opportunity.  I since reinvested a good portion, but wanted to have some cash on hand.  Obviously if they are worth 1 million in a year I'd be bummed but I can't knock anyone for taking profit.

I was a Federal Agent for quite a few years (since left to pursue a different career) and I was/am heavily invested in bitcoin.  Even while I was an agent of the US federal government (Department of Homeland Security) I knew everything that I needed to know about BTC.  So, it is possible.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:38:43
That I think comes down to how honest you are I guess.  
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:35:57
As another user commented, long-term gains can only be claimed legally if you bought the item, held it for a year or longer, then sold it.  Otherwise, if it's less than a year, you have to pay more taxes on it for some reason since it's considered short-term.

Man, the only people dealing in BTC are in Tucson or Phoenix it seems, and the rest of us are left out here.  BTW, as a fellow Arizona resident whose landscape and floors just got done thanks to bitcoin - congrats!

Wise man and seems like a good guy.   Wish there were more like him in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:32:48
Well to be completely honest I took a massive, educated risk by investing the amount I did and I didn't want to have my money sitting on an exchange.  
So I withdrew from Coinbase to ensure I had my profits in USD in my bank account, rather than on an exchange - which turns out was smart, since I was daytrading on Gox.  
Is that still BS to you though?
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:16:49
I came here to see if this was already posted because it was my thought exactly.  Sure we all love to hate on Paypal and in many cases rightfully so, but what you are doing (or your customers are doing) is a bit similar to, if not, fraud.  They provide you with a service so if you are going to agree to the terms of that service you should pay the fees that you are responsible for.
Edit:  Obviously I mean you, generally, not you specifically!
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:37:57
Up or down, soonish we will know.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:47:07
I don't blame you and obviously that would be the smarter decision.  I am the type of person that likes to get things over with though (especially taxes), so I figured I would err on the side of caution when I claimed them in going with short-term capital gains.  From everything I read and look at it makes the most sense, unless the US starts to treat it as a currency.  I just wanted to ease the anxiety of anyone who was wondering how the IRS would respond.  I still expect follow-up questions, though, but maybe I am just thinking worst case.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:18:28
Exactly.  It still is his responsibility - I'm sure there is SOME way to turn away people who try and pay with that method.  Whether that's letting them know that if they don't do it appropriately they won't get their product or something else.  If anything you could just e-mail customer support in a worst case scenario and say "Help, people keep incorrectly labeling their payments, what do I do in this situation?"
These are better options than trying to collect sweet Paypal hate-karma.
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:08:52
Hey you are entitled to your opinion, as am I.  Keep in mind these people were so far removed from my 'inner circle' that I don't think that is really valid to say.  My inner circle has been toying with bitcoins for years.  These guys were law enforcement officers who were 20 years my senior.  
Also, I recently bought an XBox one from Newegg with BTC.  This doesn't even include my purchases in the past from Overstock and Tigerdirect.
Sure, these are very few companies out of millions or what not, but I really just don't see how this can still be considered early adopter (for anyone except merchants, maybe) phase.
Once again, if somehow I can be objectively proven wrong that would be awesome and I would be elated.

Thanks, I appreciate the info.  I am well aware of the security Linux offers and utilize a variety of methods (including cold storage armory wallet on linux) but prefer my main computer to have Windows.

No problem.  I figure if the information helps out one person then it's worth it.

No problem and I'll keep it updated.

Is it trustworthy and dependable?  Thanks I'll get to googling.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:11:21
It means they accepted it for review of my refund,  so yes it means exactly what I think it means.   I have had returns rejected at this point in the past so one hurdle clearing is nice.   If I get rejected further in the process I will post that. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:36:08
As a huge bitcoin proponent - exactly.  But I would prefer these type of circlejerks to the sky is falling ones.

Believe it or not there were a lot of people (and this was a YEAR ago!) from my old place of employment (US Border Patrol of all places) who were mining and trading/buying cryptos.  The only reason I found this out is because I was talking about it and a few of them overheard me.  By the way these guys were about 20 years older than me, too (40's).  EDIT:  I think it's safe to say that demographic is probably super far removed from people we would expect to have bitcoin.
So that's how I can disagree with that, anecdotally.  Also, the fact that my parents and mother/father in law have read about it and brought it up.  
I think it's a nice thought to hope it's in early adoption stages, but it simply isn't.
That being said, if someone can prove me wrong I would be exceptionally happy seeing as I would LOVE the potential of this phase still being early adopter.

I don't think you understood what I meant completely.  There is no economic incentive for a miner to go elsewhere than GHash in most cases, so therefore it does indeed hinge on altruism.  
I am more so addressing all the blaming of GHash posts, and the idea that we can ask someone out of the kindness of their heart to basically give up complete power - GHash may do so, but someone eventually will not.  And that is the real issue.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:26:41
Thanks a lot and best of luck to you
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:39:52
I don't think you understood my post.  I know why a 51% attack is problematic and thus the concern about GHash - but my concern is that this exists to begin with.  If we have to beg an unknown (or even known) entity every so often to, out of the kindness of their heart to (and basically costing them money too) do X in order for the system to work, then THAT is a much larger problem than simply GHash itself.  As I said the success of this should not hinge on altruism.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:05:45
Exactly.  GHash is just doing what anyone in their situation would do in a free market - try and make money. The issue is that the way this network is designed, it actually allows for a mining pool to get enough power to affect all of us.  That's the problem.  Not any one specific pool, but the atmosphere that allows it to thrive.  
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:31:54
Wow, blast from the past.  I haven't been on that site since the 90's if my memory is right.
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:25:43
Same issue.  Linked to my bank account, verified everything correctly with no issues.  When I go to add some BTC to my account, however, I am repeatedly denied.  Got a very generic, non-specific response to my ticket, too.  I asked for more information and haven't heard anything.  Looks like Coinbase will continue to get my repeated buys.

Thanks - yeah, I figured and wouldn't be surprised if I was contacted for more clarification at a later date.  That's why I wanted to make sure I was 100% honest and claimed everything, though - a lot of people here may bust balls for giving in to "the man,"  but "the man" can put me in jail, and my freedom is priceless, sorry.

I do trust my OS, that along with my other security measures has me not worried about that.  However, I WOULD like to store my backups in the cloud, and I don't want to do that without encrypting it even more than just a password.

I am completely with you.  I will be honest, though, I used Mt. Gox as recently as this past run-up even though I knew better (I was just so used to their UI).  I'm just incredibly thankful that I decided to vacate that place when I did when a friend got on my case about it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:03:54
