Thanks for clear textual explanation. Used in my graphical solver:

my dad got no words like that, he watches charts regularly and text me sometimes when there is a big dip. but not in the tone of "you fool" but rather just informative "big fall in btc price.." he just noted yesterday, that once after buy-in he whould get asap verified on renowned exchange to be able to sell in all time high; not like me, who started this process already in spike and took some time and "missed" it.. but I didn't want to sell anyway :) still too cheap ;) best one was when my dad told me about existence of 42 coin =)

I tried as a fresh internatial customer and only CC/PP was offered. Even the check-out page is different with initicial form for my address. So first they try to tie you with real identity via CC or it's US only or it's not yet implemented on first-time check-out page when your address is filled. I tried to write my address somewhere in My Account to by-pass this step but no luck on this option.
So that's the question in general: Will future large shops  allow you to purchase directly for BTC instead to check your identity with CC payment first?
If you been a customer before you won't realise it. But new BTC driver customers might not like it.. It's digital cash so why not? But regulation and just the option someone can push it in the opotise way. It's probably good in some noob cases to track stolen coins but generally it's the other way around I don't like.

there is way more americans shouting nonsenses not counting stoopit memez.
logically if you speak something contraversial from the country where freedom of speach does not exists you should probably be a bit carefull..
if that exchange works in such manner I find it as reasonable explanation the owner got connections to the party. so much shady things happens in post-socialistic countries with approval from leaders.. why the China whould be any better..
@_date: 2014-01-21 11:10:22
yes that should be possible to use more accounts loaded at once in one wallet and them make one big move. tx_fee dements on the size of the transaction and age of your coins. Are you going to use Deterministic Bitcoin Address Generator for customers payments?
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:12:17
but why not to transfer funds home to your wallet in the first place?
I know all this takes a bit of time to be familiar with apps and find a separate computer with limited use to hold wallets or even learn to sign offline transactions but it's all worst the fact you did your best to protect your funds.. if you got some coins to play with it was not tempting to learn all that wallet stuff and be king of your coins?
but well ... i lost money in my life in even more silly way so no judging here..

if u do in right time...
I whould get 10x more if I whould buy directly btc for 'miner money', but

Thanks for noting.. I don't play upvote game in here.
I work in the field and my points are 'first hand' info and I have no worries to be disliked. The only speculation was ^ppl+NS/\ coop - that's just provocative guess. So either iOS is too easy to hack or there is logical inside help.. BUT as iOS is closed system even for antivirus developers it means just this?: we don't want to let our system be examied from white-hats and to be realised there is more system problems or even build-in backdoors!.. However there been recently some iOS flaws found..
I am as well user of that system and respect it was certain things but keeping myself critical and stick myself out of blind ^pple fans.
lol it's even easier to bring down OSX to knees as Windows with my code..
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:16:55
is there a bitcoin programming C-based lib which could be created for programming of bitcoin wallet? What I don't like much about current wallets is the fact that you have no exact visual representation of what inputs are used for your payments and how exactly are all those change coins returned. That could be easily visually represented what is going where. Clearly indicating if you send change coins to the address you do not control in that wallet software. Upon such case or if you spend more BTCs I whould rise confirm dialog more than once with different layout and info. Could prevent few loses I guess..
So basically your payments history whould look also like a nice graph - if whould make sense even in 3D.
If someone else whould like to code a new wallet with such detailed visual clarification of payments I can code that visual part like ABC in native C-only cross-plat without any 3rd party libs. Edit: typoz
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:33:02
both makes perfect sense! gox now rebounding lost funds from US seizes.. it makes even more sense than selling btc for cheap because you want teoretically cover your azz with legal tender currency. if you got them cheaply still maybe makes sense..
but gox's posibillity to abuse situation is pretty clear and once the profit is in charge unfortunatelly community is 2nd so I guess temporar market plummets is no big deal for them ;/

when on senate hearing there was a question about Satoshi the response was (except to Al Gore joke) answered with the fact that most of the code is rewritten these days and lot of work has been done from other devs, even like when it's open-source, it's already bug-proof with so many eyes checking the code.. so now this occasion shows how much more has to be done.. and probably devs should pick up the pace

Well... Sometimes also the other side was not so informed. On the question if there is afford to lower carbon footprint from mining BTC there was only answer from LTC guy "no, not possible with BTC". And what about ASICs? Isn't that dramatical improvement over GPUs? When was LTC guy asked about regulations in the world I was stunned he didn't mention recent Singapore's BTC taxation law. Singapore as NY is another financial hub in the world so I don't know if he just does not support that way.Funny also that Winkles been talking about controlling at the borders of the system [exchanges] and as that will be enough to control illicit uses. But that's not the whole part of the story and you can purchase BTC in real-life via localbitcoins and so... I'm not proposing regulation on this, hell no. All I want to say that regulators (or rather people providing them abstracts of the topics :)) are not _that_ dumb they do not know that. So speaking the whole truth is probably always better in such situations. But all in all I found that quite entertaining ocasion except that terrorist FUD !

If you had the backup of your wallet why you haven't tried before panic-posting to load it on _different_safe_computer_ and check if all your addresses you controlled are there. If you received coins on specific only one address it must be there plus I can hardly believe you haven't done 'export private keys' to separate file for double-check-backup. If something deleted your wallet file it's fair chance to recover it if you won't save new files to that partition. There is NTFSundelete utility. Maybe it's too naive to look for it in 'recycle bin'.
About 2 months ago there been a set of cases of coins loses in Multibit and it seemed a little bit like orchestrated attact against app's reputation. You should be ready to provide more details if you open up your case publicly.
First of all, get your backup to work asap on another computer you control.

Thanks for participation. My simple original "solver" is here:  Simply, put a part of ASCII table on horizontal axis and read out Base58 key letters. As you know it starts with 5 and it's 51 characters long. I'll notify you when the next level will be ready. :)

@_date: 2016-06-11 07:39:04
It was released on Friday (5th day in a week over here), at 5pm CET time, so there were some more weak clues about 5. Yes, starting with the first row 5 units wide would be too obvious. Used ASCII table as it's probably the first table every computer educated person will meet. Gabs in vertical lines could indicate that (those are portions of unused characters from ASCII, as there are not valid Base58 characters).
Maybe a hint about address in Base58 format would help others a lot, but the rectangles pattern is changed after 51 rows so that's a clue about it. 6 hours to solve feels about the right time. It's about the same time I spent on making it (not counting computer time spent on running vanitygen :)) even the actual code is a bit too simple. But hey, Level 1.

Perfect, finally!:) 29 hours
Bitcoin Crypto Puzzle - Level 2 Solver:
- private key is in Base58 format
- 7 bits per BASE58 character = 7 rings
- characters laid in anticlockwise orientation
- bits encoded in correct order; smallest ring = the lowest bit
- main center ring bits flipped
- If the center bit is 1, then the orientation of bits encoded in angles is flipped too
Here on the project site it's illustrated in the image:

great! I was getting worried it's way too confusing. But more direct leads would make it too easy on the other hand. I'll take some distance before releasing L4 and rethink how to make it more clear but still puzzling :). At least CRC32 of the key will be included. Here is my simple visual solver:

anonymous = myth or as long as you won't send your btcs to public service
pseudoanonymous = truth.
hit the search with "bitcoin pseudo anonymous" and read about it.
it's as long "anonymous" as long you won't tie your btcadr with other info about you entered in the registration process of used service.
with gamblig site and usage or tor it should be still fairly anonymous, just the message to anonymous user can be sent.. to take care of his wallet

Of course, that's the point. Public address 1cryptoRMRnj7Q9fgToxTRvejLnx3QRPq holds 0.0260414 BTC and your mission is to find out the private key encoded in the composition.

sorry I have a feeling I can't help you. but I'm curious where did you found backup.dat ? and _what_ happens if you install fresh Bitcoin-QT ?
you really should have ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/ folder created upon first run of BQT. I just recently tried last version on Mac.
and then with a fresh client install I whould try this:
- backup NEW empty wallet.dat from mentioned folder
- rename your found backup.dat to wallet.dat and place it there
- run BQT and check what it says. to be sure to read debug.log in the same folder.
I wish that your found backup.dat is your wallet.dat. if so, replacing it should work?
I'm always paranoid with just wallet file. Always dump privkey and save them.

well it happens when you day trade like a dummy clown instead to buy-in in times of no hype and hold/mine/spend/relax=)
or is there an other way to lose money at this moment with btc? buy-in in sudden rallies and sell in crashes is just bad idea. I guess until now those who are not skilled to trade it was always best win to hold longerm. even merchants can't complain if they put btcs into savings - if they could afford it they are happy now :) maybe those who didn't cash out black friday's income are sad a bit and worried? you will see..

i think the better idea than talk to businesses to offer BTC payment is _asking_ for your services or goods to pay in first place with BTCs. i think this is better proof you valuate the currency and prefers it instead of fiat.
and then they gonna think about it...

it will :-)

I guess the only way how the value of bitcoin goes to zero is if the system breaks aparat and stops working at all. Otherwise there is ton of people buying a lot of coins even as collectors virtual tokens at $10 $7 $1 and even more at $0.777.. Utility of bitcoin is wide and as long as miners keep on going there is a lot of other applications possible not just "payment system" or "currency concept". BTC can serve much more purposes so certain coins can have different value and purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:33:39
yep I just realised usage of BIP38 solves this problem as 40+ chars-long password is really no way to brute force in near future [i hope so:))]
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:56:36
but without mining there is no bitcoin. someone must to do it man :-) and the more the better even you won't cash out as in early days. I guess the best is apply all 3 choices to deal with btc. 1. mine 2. buy directly 3. offer work for btc

well as if ppl didn't game them a change to stop their fall into the abyss of IT history but Apple managed this hard times and builded user base of zombies who do not think just buy those "amazing marvels of technology". What kind of customers are they? Tech unix guys too but usually rather trendy people with "great" life goals. Those who are able to stand half a day because of freaking device must be living a kind of spooky world created by consuming, advertisments and fact that you lost your inner self and now you try stand above the water level and grab the latest model to be accepted in your circles.
But once they treat customers as "slaves" and grant them only the "safe path" their days are counted and even those who accepted their inovatios will rise middle finger.. Nothing last for ever and Apple is no exception. The more they will try to control their market the more they will fall once. It will take a while but it will happen as karma works for all.

i was also admired how accurate that joke is.
sometimes maybe people who know a lot throw some facts as jokes or conspiracy theories ;) but i guess the part 'satoshi as NSA employee' was surely kidding. the rest was maybe based upon classified info or rather he used common sence combined with healthy paranoia

Can you try this? 
export all private keys. I hope it exports also public addresses [havent tried yet] to check if you got this one there. Ufff this seems really strange.
I'm even scared to use multibit on my cold wallet grrrr. what version do you have in use?
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:05:57
..find key in minutes.. definitely not by trying all combinations of four english words =) brute forcing 4 words is already crazy.
does the first link rsdb.org contains some part of it?
or tell us one more hint if there is used 'and' 'or' 'for' 'of' :)
if that's common phrase sentence-attact whould maybe word but let's make it more puzzle to solve not bruteforce it for weeks :)

yes it's coming... but the most famous slovak political cartonist doesn't like btc as most ppl in slovakia think it's pyramid and ppl will be tricked - oh well - sudden price spikes are somehow not good for uninformed general public. even inteligent ppl do not want to invest time and get their own educated guess (but as usual they are ready to express their uneducated opinion based on their intuition or confusion :)). to understand btc properly you need really invest significant ammount of time.
so here is the picture "i do not take bitcoins" he probably lost the phone :)
artist is just simply against any sudden hype around btc and it's red alarm for some ppl. you know in post-soc block there been "investment" funds with big promising % gains and later money was stolen from funds (or simply it was pyramid) and regular ppl leaved without compensation. so I can imagine some people who do not get btc are scared..
they all think it must crash because it reminds them only pyramid schemes... but btc in unique economical experiment as far as i understand and how it will go further nobody really knows..

some ppl cashed out 1k coins at $200 just few weeks ago. how they can feel? but for some people those kind of money are not a big deal - they got from somewhere else too. and especially if you get rid of your coins at $200 then you probably didn't believed that much in btc and it's good you passed them to the others who believes more.. some people just holded btcs as speculation and didn't cared about the project as a whole. and those ppl do not deserve the coins with $1k price tag in their wallets :-)))

and in Multibit I was able to direct "unspent" funds to the same account just by editing wallet's .info file; line:
do you know about other way how to manage it in Multibit in more convient way?
I realised this is the most confusing about wallets/btc. Before every payment I even dream to see visualization how funds will be transfered. I whould even welcome the possibility to choose which inputs go here or there.. [that's maybe one of features of DarkWallet]

as you know your public address, check on blockchain if those 4 BTC went somewhere to other address of yours or? eventually I hope all of you got private keys backed-up and can even reinstall multibit and import priv.key again and start over or try that on other machine. as long as you see on blockchain.info that your funds haven't moved from your original address. and if they moved, I really hope they moved to other address you control and got it listed in 'receive' list.. I'm not sure now, but I hope multibit got feature to dump private key of every address you control [as long it has import priv.key feature].
multibit also get sometimes 'stalled' when downloading blockchain. So if you see your progress bar freezed, just close and run multibit again and download should progress further...
I experienced once that multibit didn't sent me test transaction of 1 satoshi (with proper 0.0001 txfee) - that was weird too... it was seen by 1 peer and then went 'dead'... but funds was not lost at the end..
ps. now don't tell me even taking out your cold wallet and split it into more addresses is not dangerous. well beeing a bank on yourself is some extra stress, but granted by tech novelty and upward volatility
