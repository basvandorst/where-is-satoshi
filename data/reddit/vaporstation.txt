I accept and hold BTC at my online electronic cigarette/eliquid storefront: 
I've spent several at bitcoinstore and have also made BTC donations to various projects I personally support.

Wow! Thank you. Love the site!

Well, we were having issues with BTC only discount codes. It has something to do with the Bitpay checkout API for Magento. You can still use discount code VSFIVE though in the meantime.

is where you belong

Different business. We're better.

Awesome to hear! I love Frisco, myself. That and VS4 are my ADV's.

I'm still not seeing it listed under the wiki.
Anyone here have editing privileges there?
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:47:34
Hear, hear!

Frisco is one of my favorites! I also recommend Dover.

A tincture kit should do the trick!
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:24:36
Not at the moment, but our next batch will have some no-nic 30mls! Keep an eye out over the next week or two!

It really depends on what your preferences are. If you want battery life, definitely go with one of the mods. I personally use the Zmax because it accepts eGo-specific atomizers. I generally go with the Redux for atomizing, but the tech is changing all the time.

Thank you! I really appreciate it!

In fact, we used to have a storefront based out of Coleford, Gloucestershire. My business partner decided a couple years back to go full throttle towards a career oriented around his passion of photography, and I decided to go ahead and close up shop instead of replacing him.

Thank you! What an awesome idea.

I'm not all that familiar with Gamucci, tbh. From what I remember a couple years ago I saw a kiosk in the mall. I'm not familiar with their product line. I don't want to speak badly of Gamucci brand, but I've had a lot of customers come to us after using one and having problems with it. Through the years I've weeded out the bad products and only stocked the most reliable ones. There are problems sometimes, as with any electronic product, but we offer the most reliable and consistent products available.
We offer eliquid, so long as they're refillable we could definitely satisfy that need. Otherwise, if you have any problems you might consider trying one of our starter kits/hardware items.

Congrats! The Darwin is a wonderful device. I've wanted to purchase one in the past, but it was always out of stock!

We have several customers in the UK, actually. USPS raised their international rates in January. We used to offer the sample give away to international customers and cover the shipping, too, but after the new rates more than doubled it's just too hard to justify it anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:09:50
Me, too!
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:30:06
What country are you from? We ship international orders daily. We've only had a couple of problems in our 4.5 years of operation. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:20:46
My personal favorite vapes are Frisco, VS4 and Tampa.

We just established a new discount code for BTC orders only!
Use BTC6 for 6% off your order total when you check out using Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:32:43
That's understandable. There are plenty of shops with prices lower than that. Our eliquids are the best of the best, though!

If possible, take a picture of your battery and email it to eric I should be able to determine whether or not it's a model we carry.
