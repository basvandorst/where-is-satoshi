Try recovery software like recuva.  As long as you did not format the drive you might find the dat file.  Watch out you might find some wierd shit that someone else deleted from your computer, you cant unsee things :)

I really like Andreas Antonopoulos and his work but I feel he was not practicing what he preached when hhe sold all his bitcoin.  If he truely believed that bitcoin was gonna go global and take over then he would not have sold his bitcoin.  Either that or he is smart and told everyone he sold his bitcoin so he is not targeted by criminals.  Now he will have to tell everyone he has sold again.

If you immediatly convert them it is not an issue as there will be no gain or loss.  What happens when you do not immediatly convert the coins ?  You then have to record all profits and losses from holding crypto.  Seems like an admin nightmare.

These experts better start retraining in blockchain as soon they will be experts of a past system that no longer works.

During this delay please read about and consider using litecoin instead next time for a speedy service.

He is right to say that most othercoins will be worthless.  Dont be too diverse now.

Do you have to pay taxes if you accept litecoin as payment ?  Say I want $3000 dollars for my car so I accept 10 litecoins as payment but do not sell the litecoins right away.  Then the litecoins end up being worth $30,000 a few years later when I come to sell them would I have to pay taxes on that gain ?  How can someone accept litecoin as payment if they have to track its value for tax purposes ?

I think he did not sell.  I expect he just said that he sold for security reasons.    Something does not add up to me.

Yeah but then with any other saale you do not have to pay tax if the price of the currency changes.

Paper money created out of thin air and controlled by untrustworthy humans ?  No thanks.

I have an idea.  We start a chicken colony on the moon.  The chickens will be able to fly due to low gravity and have no predators so it will be a utopia planet for chickens.  Then make it a live youtube channel = profit.  Are you in ?  5000 bitcoins to get us started but do not worry as you are sure  to get a lot more back.  PM ME

He has also been to prison for selling illegal fireworks (explosives?) on the internet.  He is banned from entering the USA because of this.

He thinks its insulting to call bitcoin cash "Bcash", yet he keeps calling bitcoin "bitcoin core" or just "core".  He must be intentionally trying to insult the bitcoin community by getting the name wrong on purpose all the time.

It really is about time that every exchange insist that bitcoin cash remove the word bitcoin from its name.  Far too many people being conned by bitcoin cash scammers.  If they just called it Bcash and dropped the whole "we are the real bitcoin" thing I would not have a problem.
