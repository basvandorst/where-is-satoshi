Well if it blows through 500,000 like it did 10,000 then I'll hold. But currently, 500,000 gives me enough to pay off my house. 
Would have had it already if I wasn't an asshat and been buying from the beginning like everybody told me too. There was always an excuse though. Lesson learned. The hard way.

I'm not selling until $500,000. 
So I'll be holding a while I guess.

Same I sold everything in February. Really rubs salt in the wounds.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:31:05
Yeah probably.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:09:33
Yeah. Lesson learned on my part. But back then dash wasn't worth a whole lot so yes I lost money, but I still came out with more than I had put in. Aaaaand then I sold at 16.

Holy fuck you aren't kidding!
I looked at it back when it was 7600 and forgot about it. 
Yay money!

Nah. I wish I had bought 10. I had 3.3 but sold for dash. Then sold those dash at 16. 
Add insult to injury, I had 250 dash but lost a chunk to cryptsy. I had 175 when I sold. Earlier this year. 
Any coins you have, hold onto them. Set a sell limit of like, something insane, and just hold them until it reaches that point.

Maybe I should buy some more.

What weed stocks?
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:34:15
Awesome. Thanks!  I googled it a few weeks ago but didn't find anything.

I don't know who you're talking about, but I've been following it since it was darkcoin. I personally like the concept of dash. But I like that Bitcoin has a public ledger. But instant transfers are awesome.

How do you feel about dash?
