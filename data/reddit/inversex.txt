I want bitcoin to become an everyday payment method, not some special case requiring further discounts.

People are silly and don't take into account changing circumstances. 
Many are thinking "OMG 28800 signed up to buy" and that's it. 
In reality 28799 of those people are casual investors who are looking at the steadily declining price. They are now thinking "We'll, I'm not going to buy when it's going down" and sit out of the market. 
BTC is going to fall a fair bit over the next couple of months. 
This accounts will amplify the next boom, but it's certainly not going to fix this bust.

You're 100% right, but that won't stop the skeptics disagreeing with you. 
Unfortunately in some people's world Bitcoin is perfect and anything that prevents a $10,000 / coin value right this second is a conspiracy theory, be it Wall Street feeling threatened, the banks, or the US Government trying to destroy us all. 
Thanks for your insight, but know anyone who's smart enough to think about your post already doesn't believe it, and anyone who isn't you're never going to convince anyway.

With regards to that the key thing to understand is the ASIC is not a CPU, it's an ASIC. 
CPU's and GPU's are designed to be general purpose. They are good at all different types of math, so for example they are really good at hashing, which is what the bitcoins are calculated on (SHA2(SHA2)). They are also really good at lots of other types of math, even different forms of hashing is an example of this, they can do MD5, SHA1, etc etc. Key thing is you can use it for anything. 
ASIC on the other hand is highly optimized for ONE operation. They can do, and will only ever do, (SHA2(SHA2)) REALLY well. They cannot do anything else, which makes them also useless for anything else. GPU vs ASIC is general purpose vs specialization, and while Nvidia / AMD could make a specialized ASIC for bitcoin mining, it's not the same thing as the GPU's they normally develop. 
Edit: My terminology is a little wrong in places but you get the point.

Bitcoin is the Base58 encoding of multiple hashes and further manipulation of the public key... trying to keep it simple here. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:25:07
No, I'm using MtGox (waiting in the queue) because it gives me the option to get my bitcoins at the lowest cost to me. Show me a cheaper way of doing it (once you take fee's, rate of coins, etc) into account and I'll do it in a heartbeat.

Just remember - "I'll speculate in this stock / item because it's in a bubble" said no investor ever. 
100% of people purchasing in a bubble were 100% convinced it wasn't a bubble.

Although commendable and better than 99% of what people are doing to promote bitcoin, I think the entry barrier from fiat &gt; BTC is the larger issue and id love to see more developers working on that

Hey all - Very new python user and I wanted to make something up to answer a question I saw before. Essentially "If I have a lot of addresses, how can I total up the value of them in USD". 
Instructions. 
1. Copy and paste from pastebin into a file such as "query.py"
2. Install python if you don't have it already - 
3. Create a list of accounts you want to check in a text file, one account per line, we'll call it "accounts.txt"
4. In command line go to the location you saved the query.py file and the accounts.txt file, then type python query.py accounts.txt
5. This should return the amount in your accounts in USD based off current market rates. 
I was using this behind a proxy, so if it doesn't work let me know and I'll fix it up. It's only a small silly script but it might be useful for some people with multiple addresses. 
Cheers.

Firstly I'll say upfront I haven't see any figures to suggest the floor has risen dramatically any time recently, although I'm happy to be proven wrong (i.e. data on the amount of bitcoins used to purchase goods &amp; services). 
Secondly there isn't any evidence that the floor is keeping pace in any way with the rise due to speculation. Hypothetical numbers to prove a point - if the floor rises from $10 to $15, but the cost goes from $15 to $100, it's still a massive bubble which can crash down to the new, improved, $15. 
Positive feedback looks are what creates bubbles - until a factor changes, then it goes back down and the bubble bursts. My point I'm trying to get at I suppose is while the OP may be correct in terms of transactions -&gt; bubble or bubble -&gt; transactions, the fact is we simply don't know and it has no influence on trying to determine whether this is a bubble or not. People suggesting it's a bubble ("Bubble Theorists") are just about as likely to be right as wrong at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:01:51
While true, I'd argue that within reason a 51% attack is pretty unlikely at this stage, even more so in the future (assuming an equal distribution of technologies, i.e. ASIC's are in people's hands). 
I suppose the question could also be phrased - How 'secure' does it need to be before becoming wasteful. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:16:35
The issue I have is that you're restricting users ability to do things (even if they are, in my opinion, pointless) with the aim of solving a problem. 
The problem, however, will not be solved with this proposed solution. The block chain will still grow exponentially, and certainly it's only going to be a matter of time before it's impractical for new people to download - restriction in place or not. 
So, rather than restricting the usability of bitcoin, why not try and come up with something that actually solves the problem?
@_date: 2013-05-15 12:09:05
The thing I don't get is what justifications are all these banks (not just this incident) using for shutting down Bitcoin related services? 
Seems like they would at least have to justify it with some reasoning, but it seems like none is forthcoming. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:06:26
Only because of speculation. The whole point is once this speculation goes away the only 'demand' is related to its underlying fundamentals I.e how much people want to actually transfer money with it, how much people actually want to buy from bitstore.com with it. At this stage there isn't much demand for that.

The smaller the economy, the more a single person, or small group of people can have an effect over it. 
For example if there were in total $10,000 worth of bitcoins, a single person may be able to double the entire market cap single handed. Multiple people could have a dramatic impact because lots of people could invest $100, $500, $1000... 1%, 5% and 10% respectively. Now scale it up to $1,000,000. In general people will still have the same individual wealth to invest, but it's only 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1% of the network. This has a much smaller effect. 
Obviously we're not talking about a single person, but a group of people. We're also talking about $1 billion. On the scale of this it's very small, and small amounts of people can have large effects as they represent large portions of the market leading to high volatility. As the market grows bigger, $10 billion, $50 billion it has a lot more inertia and is more stable.
TL;DR It's easier to push around a skinny person than a fat one.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:08:22
Processing transactions I think is extremely useful, and if we could do it faster / better then it would be fantastic. My understanding is though we're processing them at exactly the same rate as if the network was at 1 TH/s given the difficulty is adjusted to simply make it artificially harder to do, is that right?
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:29:26
At the current market rate it would take precisely 1 bit cent to bang his mom.

Wish someone could do one of these for Australia
@_date: 2013-03-31 08:32:06
It sucks, but in Australia I can't see any other reasonable choice when factoring in rates, cost of bitcoins for around $1000 :( 
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:55:17
Your post states that the bitcoin price will always lead the transactions, but that statement doesn't say anything as to whether or not it's a bubble currently. 
Will the transactions materialize? Will they not? That's the unknown. If they do it's not a bubble, if they don't it's a bubble. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:58:13
Realistically compared to the market cap of bitcoins ~$1 billion, it's not used very widely yet. For example that's one store which show's that it *can* be used, but it's not really evidence that shows it *is* being used.
 The only figures I can see is they are at 1% of their sales goal, which if anything makes it seem like it's *not* being used, but I don't know when that count started so I can't judge (may only be 1% of time through the count for example). 
When we see Bitcoin become more mainstream we'll see some genuine bit increases in the floor in my opinion. 
For those of you at home, mainstream is: 
Ask your random neighbor with no technical background what a Bitcoin is and they know without your explaining it, regardless of how great they think it is after you do. Alternatively big companies accepting it (i.e. don't have "bit" or "bitcoin" in their name) such as Amazon. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:28:52
I agree, it's stupidly hard to buy bitcoins from Australia at a resonable rate doing something like a bank transfer. You wouldn't think it would be any harder than purchasing something online, but unfortunately it is. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 12:40:25
Yes, they have the right according to their policies not to issues refunds. 
The issue becomes that in the past BFL not holding up their end of the bargin (delivering the product) hasn't been as big an issue as it could have been because customers had a method of redress (asking for a refund). 
If they deny this, and suddenly customers aren't allowed refunds and BFL are still not holding up their end of the deal (delivering units) then it becomes a big deal.

Sooo, does this give legal legitimacy to bitcoin then? If they are guilty of 'currency exchange' then both USD and BTC must be legally recognised as currencies... 
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:24:00
Not true. It's a ratio, not an absolute figure. To illustrate lets use some hypothetical figures.
Magically a mobile phones computing power increases to where it could hash 1GH/s, clearly an insane improvement over now. The issue is the same improvements are made in other technology, so the 'attackers' have access to the equivalent of modern day ASICs improved by the same amount, producing 1000TH/s. Again the numbers are made up but it illustrates that no matter how big the numbers get the proportions are all that matters. 
If the network is 1 TH total and it costs me $100000 to obtain 510 GH it's just as dangerous as 5 years down the track when the network is 1 PH and it costs $100000 to obtain 510 TH
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:15:48


Yeah like I said wasn't trying to make a point when I didn't know the truth of it. 500k is definitively a good start, and good for them. Saying that the amount in question is able to be explained by a strong supporting by a passionate community. Anything that's focusing explicitly on bitcoins at the moment will most likely get a bump due to followers (such as this community) actively supporting them. Unfortunately this doesn't scale to well when you expand it to the general population who don't care as passionately about the underlying concepts. 


They are not big companies. I know what you're going to say (OMG Look at how many people use Wordpress and Reddit!) but they hardly are high selling a high volume of consumer products. Reddit you can buy what? Reddit Gold? What does Wordpress even sell? Namecheap? Again only relevant to a highly tech savvy market. 
Once again I'd say mainstream is a high volume that isn't attached to the tech savvy crowd. Amazon, eBay, Paypal, if I can buy a can of coke from a vending machine with it on every corner then fantastic. 
Finally I'd say I'm not arguing that the path to mainstream acceptance doesn't follow exactly this route, or it would look any different if it were to be accepted in a mainstream setting, I'm just saying we're not that close.... *yet*

No. 
Focus on being light, witty and educating people that there is a nice alternative that matters to them. 
If you're advertising, it's to the mainstream, and they really don't care about your desires to overthrow the financial system or way out there rhetoric such as comparing the current situation to the Berlin wall.

@_date: 2013-04-16 04:10:13
1. Coinbase has nice relatively secure wallets online. As with everything, different people require different levels of security. Many of the "anti-establishment" types go a little overboard around here, so you might be thinking the bar is a little higher than it really is in order to get a secure wallet. Using Coinbase with two factor authentication I'd be *very* surprised if you got compromised. 
2. Chicken and egg. I'm not going to defend it, Bitcoin has some useful functionality now (i.e. transferring money), is useful in the few cases where it's accepted, but it's definitely a niche. Saying that, many people are happy to take the risk now to do something they believe in, and honestly many think they will make money out of it long term. 
3. Agree completely. Buying BTC sucks. The biggest issue stems from the fact that fiat is reversible, BTC isn't, hence as a BTC seller you need to take a lot of precautions before you agree to give up your BTC. Saying that - it's you can't really purchase cash online with a credit card either, and BTC is the digital equivalent of cash. Improvement could be made. 
4. Everything is as complicated as you make it. You can get BTC, spend it, and that's all you need to do. It's relatively idiot proof given a basic level of understanding. What I mean by a basic level is if I handed a cave man a credit card he wouldn't know he needs to swipe it at the point of sale. 
Overall I think you have some valid points, BTC has a lot of challenges to overcome before mainstream adoption. Saying that, I believe in BTC mainly because I think the advantages outweigh the negatives and a lot of the issues stem from an immature market rather than fundamental problems with the concept. There is no reason to get in "NOW" if you don't want to, so feel free to get the benefits of bitcoins in 3-4 years time.

If people want me to use other exchanges those other exchanges need to get their shit together first. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:02:30
Essentially yes. 
Paper wallet is fancy name for storing the information that's usually on your computer offline. A wallet.dat file usually has numbers in it, you simply write down these numbers and delete the wallet.dat. You can always plug the numbers back in, but if it's not on a computer it can't be electronically stolen. 
The over the top precautions (not connected to the internet, live CD's etc etc) just makes sure the very very brief period it's on a computer is safe.

The private key is never 'visible' on block chain. Online wallets store the private key in their systems which is why many don't consider them a good idea. You need to read up on private / public key encryption. 
Bitcoin addresses are public keys. Respectfully not much point talking about paper wallets without understanding the cryptography at a basic level if you want to understand why they are safer.

I have to say I agree that I think it's a bubble. 
The thing that get's me is people seem to think that attacking the current price rise is the same as attacking bitcoin itself. Just because you think it's overvalued now doesn't mean the concept itself is bad or it's not the way of the future. 
I expect a crash down to $50 - $60 followed by slow appreciation from there.
