That is not the same as "reversing" md5. Hashes can be cracked, not reversed. You are correct that you can generate md5 collisions by appending data (a lot I believe, but I'm not an expert), but saying that is "reversing" md5 is misleading.

You're assuming pretty high level of discipline. I'd even bet at least some of those coins were mined in the process of debugging/development, seeing as the early wallet was pretty buggy.


Bitcoin is/was an experiment, I have no idea why you assume such a high level of foresight and planning. Satoshi could very easily have been a skilled hobbyist cryptographer (though from what I gather, maybe not the worlds greatest software engineer), who then collaborated w/ other people from cypherpunk/cryptoanarchist/whatever communities. Honestly, thats the coolest part about the whole thing. Somehow I doubt Bitcoin was developed by a sophisticated cabal, as you suggest.

It could be done without it, see: DigiCash. The blockchain is one way to defend against double-spends, tho

You can't reverse a sha256 hash any more than you can turn a sausage back into a pig.

Precious metals retailers often pass on the cc costs.
It would cost close to $200 with a cc or paypal. Most people mail checks for this reason. Cc is more than twice as costly, even if you were to factor I'm the spread and the &lt;$1 ACH fee it's still good savings. BTC is actually cheaper here because there chant passes on the costs of cc transactions to the customer.
Troll better

1999 called, it wants it's performance metrics back. CTR is dying, as a metric for engagement, and rightfully so. I'm unsure why you're equating high CTR to good traffic...
Additionally, CPC &amp; CPA do not fit into the pricing model of exchanges, where most inventory is sold, and penalizing publishers for your shitty creative isn't acceptable to most people
Source: I used to work in the industry
TL;DR "I HAVE A 50% CTR THIS TRAFFIC IS AMAZING" -everyone who still uses CTR to measure performance in 2014

Plenty of people pay for porn, for a few good reasons:
* lots if high(er) quality content
* HD content 
* **you know it's legally produced with consenting, of-age performers**
* convenience
To name a few.

Last time I used WU to send money internationally, I sent $1000 and change and paid close to $100 in fees. This was a few years ago, though. At the time they were promoting $50 domestic for $5, what a deal!
WU offers decent service but left some room for improvement from my perspective. The fees could get steep, and having to walk to or from the store, with large amounts of cash (WU terminals are a great place to rob people), was not good times. I was mostly sending money to technically savvy people, with reliable power and internet, and so the whole brick and mortar network wasn't really an asset, there was just no batter way to move the money that wouldn't take plural days. 
TL;DR mixed feelings about WU
