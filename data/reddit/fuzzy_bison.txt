If there were a Chuck-E-Cheese near by, it would be perfect! Now a "gift card" kind of card might just do the trick...
thank you.

I like this idea but they are out of stock (and I would never get them in time for Christmas even if they were). Something to look at for birthdays!
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:56:39
I like this... one part via email... the other by phone or text.  It's kind of a two-part verification system.
Thanks for the suggestion.

I'll definitely give the video a look later today. Thanks!
At current rates, I'm not thinking of giving them 2btc each (or even total), however, thanks for the warning about keeping a copy of the info.  
How about for my kid who is half-way across the country who likely doesn't have a bitcoin wallet. Same procedure but send her a pdf?

Well, they are apparently out the the 3 pack of the USB keys.
This was posted back in August, I think... 


. You might have noticed that the Opendime store is out-of-stock.

If the ex-bf got any coin on it a year ago, yeah.. I hope he kept it.

To be honest, if you came to me with an ounce of gold, I would not take the trade! Because I have no way of proving it's an ounce of gold! I suppose I could take it to a gold trader to find out the value but then I'd have to trade it in in order to pay my utilities. That's one of the reasons fiat currencies came to be!
And I do not want to push a Webster's definition of currency onto things! I supplied it because that seems to be a very common comparison in this subreddit! I just don't think it's appropriate for r/Bitcoin to mock currencies when people are not, in general, using Bitcoin as a currency!
I've said numerous times in this thread that I would love for cryptocurrency to become actual currency that people are using on a daily basis and I'm frustrated that people keep holding it because then it just becomes an investment vehicle and not an actual currency! 
If Bitcoin loses its cachet as an investment vehicle, it will see massive growth as an actual currency! Which unfortunately will increase people's interest in it as an investment vehicle and we hit the whole cycle over again!
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:11:24
Analogies are definitely imperfect! 
So do people spend Bitcoin or do they hold Bitcoin? If all you're doing is holding and waiting for it to grow, it is not a currency (or it's not for spending) it's an investment.
I see a lot of posts on this subreddit that belittle standard currencies and extol Bitcoin in their stead but I also see a huge number of posts saying how everybody should be holding on to their bitcoins! 
It's not me that made the imperfect comparison it's this subreddit itself that makes the comparison all the time!
The real beauty of cryptocurrencies, any cryptocurrencies, is that they are not managed by a government and that they are not traceable by your bank or your government! But that only comes into play if they're spent.

First off, as far as the term "money" goes...
 mon·ey/ˈmənē/*noun*
1. a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes; coins and banknotes collectively.
Also, Bitcoin is not "in general use in a particular country." Unless you want to consider the internet a "country" which I'm kind of okay with. But it's not in general use because, again, people are just holding and not using it. Or am I wrong? When is the last time you spent Bitcoin? 
and I guess to your original point, you never "changed your mind" because your mind is already made up.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:02:41
You've changed the discussion from whether Bitcoin is a currency to whether religions are a mental disorder? 
Let me change it then... Do you, or anyone you know, exchange Bitcoin for anything other than other cryptocurrencies? Let's add in the caveat "legal" here. Do you, or anyone you know, exchange Bitcoin for anything legal other than other cryptocurrencies.
I'm not sure I understand your point about Coinbase. They claim to be a wallet service, which to carry the currency analogy to here, would be like a bank. So I don't have to have all my money in cash. I keep it in a bank. So I don't accidentally fuck myself in Bitcoin by deleting or losing something, I keep it in a wallet service. Is this not correct?
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:39:31
Thank you for this! I will have to look into the best way to move to my own wallet!
as I asked someone else earlier, do you have any recommendations for particular vendors where you are using Bitcoin for transactions?
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:10:11
Thanks for this. 
... maybe. I just went to Overstock and I am NOT going to show that to my GF!! But I do understand the value of a coffee table right now to make the wife happy! ;-)
Do you have a prefered list of online vendors?
@_date: 2019-10-15 02:49:42






I spelled that way because... Sigh! How many o's in r/whoooosh?
I did say that people save currency ...but primarily spend.
 






Eloquent. I did just check and it appears there is not a fee... as long as they stay within Coinbase. So my money is good as long as everyone uses the same bank? Still not currency.






The problem is not isolated to Canada and you should know that.


Sure! So why is it constantly compared to currencies? Also, do you exchange it? or just HODL?
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:26:07
Perhaps, but that is the comparison I see here all the time. Comparing to standard currency. 
Again, I'd love to see a universal, government-independent, untraceable currency available worldwide. Sure, there is potential damage that could do but there is a LOT of good it could do and I think the good outweighs the potential "evil".
But HODLing Bitcoin is removing it from being an actual currency, IMHO.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:07:06
Ok... I have not looked into such things as a "Lightning Network" so you've given me the first piece of information worth following on this thread so far without trying to be smug or condescending. Thank you.
I've got to say that it's annoying that the first thing I come upon is a reference to Investopedia kinda supporting my idea that Bitcoin is not really a currency.
You see, most folks here seem to have missed my point. I'd LOVE Bitcoin or any CryptoCurrency to become an authentic currency! There is SO much value to it! But I can't see it happening while people insist that they have to HODL!
So thanks again for the new info.
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:24:45
Hmm. Thanks for this. I'll recheck my sources.
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:13:32
Eloquent! Thanks for all of your humongous effort in this response! Must have taken you hours!
@_date: 2019-10-15 02:34:28
good argument.
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:06:24
Thank you for this feedback! I do mean that quite sincerely!
As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago in another response, I think if the price of Bitcoin stabilizes then we will see a vastly increased adoption of using Bitcoin as an actual currency! And then the problem is that if it becomes adopted much wider than we will hit another spike in value and it will start the hole HODL thing all over again!
My whole reason for ever getting Bitcoin was to divvy it up to friends and relatives for Christmas presents! I bought a couple hundred dollars worth and was going to assign each one $20, $30, $50 on their own paper Bitcoin wallets! I mean, it cost me I think $20 in fees to get my $200 put into Bitcoin but I thought it would be a really interesting way of having a great conversation! And then I found that I was gonna be hit with a transfer fee of about $25 per transfer to each Bitcoin wallet outside of coinbase! from what I've read since this thread started, I see that that is changed, but I know how it was when I first bought it!
I would love to evangelize, but you can't evangelize if you don't believe! 
I believe in the idea! But I don't believe that right now you can actually spend Bitcoin and not risk feeling like an idiot in a couple of months or years! There's a guy out there who spent 10000 Bitcoin on two pizzas!
And I can't spend this stuff here in Canada anyway!
But I'm definitely going to look into the Lightning Network! More than one person has mentioned it and if it's a way out of the HODL situation I'm all for it!
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:22:52
I'm not sure why you say this. 
At the last halving, May 20th, I believe, the value of Bitcoin was about $7921.55 and it's around $8,328.34 now. Even looking between May 18 and the halving the value went from $ 7321.33 so up about $600 per Bitcoin. 
It's a great increase if you purchased the day before, and even since then (while it has been spikey) it has been growing, so good on ya if you got in at the right time. 
But with the volatility of the Bitcoin market then if it did spike as high as housing prices for you, would you actually spend it or HODL more hoping for more returns?

 cur·ren·cy/ˈkərənsē/*noun*
1. 1.a system of money in general use in a particular country.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:10:31
Thanks for this! I will look into that for sure!
Not I feel like this is the kind of intelligent dialogue that will help newbies like me, and move Bitcoin closer to wider acceptance.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:04:32
Wow! I got one terse and elitist response that actually dealt with absolutely none of what I was saying and was promptly deleted, and I'm getting downvoted!
These are my actual experiences with Bitcoin in general, and coinbase in particular! Change my mind if you want.
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:20:42
It was indeed in December.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:41:02
No. No it's not. 
If anything Coinbase is one of the best ways to cement the terms "fraud" and "Ponzi scheme" into this wonderful technology.
Very unfortunately. somebody online recommended Coinbase to me as a way to get into Bitcoin! It's very possible that the person who recommended it did not know that Coinbase is not able to sell in Canada, so I can only use Coinbase to purchase Bitcoins but not actually use them! But Coinbase would have known that and should have informed me before I installed their software! They were astute enough to let me know immediately... Immediately! ...After I committed money to them!
The $200 I put in that immediately diminished to under $180 because of "fees" was not particularly amusing, but, I thought, I guess they have to make some money in the process. Seemed quite high to me, though...
Well I guess that was okay because my goal was not to actually purchase anything using Bitcoin. I was going to make this a small part of Christmas gifts and create paper wallets for family members! Conversation pieces... 
So I attempted to send $20 to a paper wallet for my 81 year old mother. Bitcoin was in the news so I thought it would be an amusing gift... and I also thought it would never be something she would actually use, hence the$20!
The fee would be over $50! (I was notified that it would be free if I sent to somebody on Coinbase! How generous of them! If I get more people wrapped up into their scheme then I can send the money for free! That smells pretty Ponzi scheme to me!)
Now sending money is something that I can do through an e-transfer for free! Coinbase wanted to charge me over $50 for essentially that same action! 
Coinbase, and anybody else that deals in this sort of gouging is what will kill this technology! This is actually what banks used to do 20 years ago! Except I don't think their fees were ever that high! We need to be better than Banks!
I actually do believe it's wonderful technology and has the potential to do amazing things! It's not an investment tool though! Unfortunately that is the way many people are looking at it! 
If it's ever meant to be currency it has to be spendable and it has to be spent! 
As for the money I put in coinbase, I've left it there and watched it dwindle. A reminder of how right everybody was that said don't put more money into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose! 
That's at least one piece of Bitcoin advice I'm glad I listened to!
