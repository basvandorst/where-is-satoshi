You need to zoom out and be patient. It's up over 300% in the past 5 months. A week is not "a while".

What direction do you all think Bitcoin's going to go today?
-I'm gonna move my feet tonight
-I'm gonna show my funky side ~like nobody's watchin~

" 'And,' she added, 'We do not want innovation that would shake the system so much that we would lose the stability that is needed.' ”
This seems like a less-than ideal endorsement.

If scientists can get Bitcoin to make hair grow on heads as well as it seems to make hair grow on the necks of some of you, baldness will be cured. Reading through some of the comments on here, you'd think Bitcoin was a religion. If you're constantly vacillating between wojak and lambo because of what you see on the 1m, you need to zoom out and learn to be patient. BTC is a great store of value/currency/investment, but at the moment one of its most effective uses is to funnel money away from ignorant dreamers and into the pockets of wealthy whales. Approach crypto with knowledge, not hope. Or just be patient and HODL.

Nobody ever buys the dip perfectly. Just gotta make an educated guess and be confident.

They can outlaw air if they want. It'll still exist.

Congrats! You're the millionth noob FUDster who thought crypto was dying at some point during its 10-year history. And yet, it's still here.

Anything could happen. It's currently at $11.5k. If it goes to $11k, I'll believe it can go to $10k. If it goes to 10k, I'll believe $9k is possible. If $9k, then $8k...$7k... $6k...$5k... $4k. But I don't think worrying about $4k is worth your time when it's at $11.5k. Bitcoin is unpredictable, but I feel I can safely predict that it won't drop to $4k anytime soon. But it could. Or not.

No kidding, they are out in force. In this thread I just read, "It might be over for Bitcoin." gtfo beartrolls.

He ran two models. One focused on the decreasing supply of Bitcoin due to the halving and predicted $56k. The other focused on demand and predicted $2400.

You can win by trading. People do it all the time. Most people who consistently lose through trading are degenerate gamblers with no patience whose decisions are based on FOMO and FUD.

I agree. If I compare my profits against the number of hours I've spent "working" on my crypto positions, I'm probably making less than minimum wage. I consider it a hobby though.
