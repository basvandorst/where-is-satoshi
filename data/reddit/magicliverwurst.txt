@_date: 2013-11-20 05:41:40
lol i understand what you mean but there is no such thing... i do hope however it falls to sub $200 so i can buy alot. I believe in bitcoin.. i know its the future. 
*as long as it doesnt get myspaced
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:57:35
ive been doing the same yet bought mine at its highest when it was $450. I believe regardless of crash/crashes a bitcoin will be well worth more than a few thousand atleast

Don't think so much about tomorrow ...think about a year, 5 years, 10 years. Its an investment in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:15:01

@_date: 2013-11-20 05:34:46

NSA is a great example of where the worlds headed as well. It tracks everyone's movements &amp; transactions. Nothing is anonymous anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:24:28
i agree itll be atleast 1000 by tomorrow night given the us news tomorrow .. there is also no way the value of a bitcoin is worth in the hundreds when the vast majority barely even know about bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:47:05
a tulip is a flower...
a bitcoin is a technological advancement
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:33:51
i feel your pain -.-
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:09:51
your only hope at this point is to wait till it crashes that is unless you believe a bitcoin will never be worth 600 again
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:29:28
No one has a crystal ball.
However, my research makes me believe in the long run it'll be extremely rare to even own just 1 coin.
Depends on what you are tying to achieve.

when has a governemnt program ever worked well?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:29:54
too good to be true
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:49:27
If i got a bitcoin for every time some one asked this question today... i'd be rich!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:57:07

your a college student willing to spend $550... think of all the big shots still unaware. take a chance.. worst that can happen is you learn a cheap valuable lesson in investing
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:23:30
lmao! troll
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:36:33
Just look at the market... that says it all.
..the panel was level headed and realistic. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:20:35
no, im still in favor of bitcoin but people need to be honest about the technology and its implications
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:34
the price is locked in at the time of purchase
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:36:58
is litecoin worth buying now? will everyone be kicking themselves next year saying "oh i wished i bought them at $40"
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:45:16
no one has a crystal ball
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:08:40
lol you guys are funny... watch it go to $1000 tomorrow
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:03:22
I like bitcoin but i also agree. People say "open source" or "No central authority" but how bout the world gov's spy capabilties. You think they cant track your movement online? What about when you want  to convert back to fiat? Comon guys.. bitcoin is very cool but get real.. everything you do is recorded and can be traced.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:45:40
reddit is like a broken record
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:57:26

No one has the crystal ball, its up to you my friend. God Bless
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:23:21
Lets say your are the fbi, who seized all those bitcoins after silk road. They spent $0 yet can sell all of them at $900.. making people panic. They then buy them all back after the price falls.. continue the cycle?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:27:30
have some respect for yourself bit&lt;h.
