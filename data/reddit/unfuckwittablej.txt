Oh, if you break even my understanding is you had 0 capital gains so you shouldn’t need to pay any tax
Edit: I’m pointing out this a logical assumption given that taxes are for the entire year, so if you did not have any “capital gains” from Jan 1 to dec 31 since you won and lost the same amount, you shouldn’t have to

I think no matter what, if you have money in a coin it won’t be considered as gains even with a profit. I think once it’s converted to USD in your wallet or bank is when it gets taxed as capital gains. Atleast that’s my understanding of normal stocks. So long as the currency of your earnings aren’t in USD should be ok

Where do you think the floor will be?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:19
In the US or a specific country?

I️ bought months ago, so I’m currently sitting at double my investment for all my coins. Thinking of selling and just spectating now, to your point a win is a win. Just sucks I️ lost 10k in profits over the last week and it’s effecting my decision on sell vs hodl

This is exactly my thought. It’ll get them to look up an article about it and read the first one they see
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:14:14

Is it too late to claim the bch as a Coinbase user?

What’s making you sell? Do you not think it will continue to rise?

I’m a relatively new user on here (few months, bout at 3900) and even I have noticed it. It’s annoying when I’m trying to read actual articles and discussions. I like reading stuff that makes me more knowledgeable on btc and all the forks and future potential/complications it faces. 
Now, every other post is asking if they should buy or sell bitcoin, if anyone thinks it will hit X dollars in Y years, etc

Probably for space reasons, when you are writing emails or putting accomplishments on your resume it’s a quick eye catcher too

How old are you? This is very commonly used in industry/corporate world, and globally. It’s all about acronyms for everything, even if unnecessary. 
One thing for sure is SI wouldn’t be used in this case because we don’t have a unit of measure to pre/suffix it. 
While we’re at it, let’s talk to the NFL about their Super Bowl numbering. It’s only for Ancient Rome!

Well M is the Roman numeral suffix for thousand, as used in OP. So MM is a thousand thousand. 
This is mainly used in business for quantities or money. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:51:16
MM is million

Amen. It's my fault for listening to this sub that prevented me from buying more @ $3000-$4000
