holy fuck, almost like a debit card reader that the transaction gets punched in to, and you put in your pin number, or with newer cards that have the rfid chip you just tap them.

the concept he's conveying is the same, access to your funds without having to carry hard currency.

no, but cheers to your deliberate obtuseness.

Simple to use? I had to open an account at an exchange site, go through multiple levels of identity confirmation before I could use it, jump through hoops to fund it with fiat, then wait to buy until the price seemed to settle for a few days.

So, a debit card. He had a debit card attached to his bank account, like everyone does.

A certain percentage of bitcoin holders care about blockchain and the technology and the possibilities it represents for the future of what we think of as money. Another percentage thinks of it as a high risk investment that could one day yield lambos. Which percentage is higher? I don't know for sure, but I have my eye on a shiny red deathmobile.

You can only do that as long as hardly anybody pays in bitcoin. If it started to represent a significant portion of your revenue, you'd run into cash flow problems as you can't pay your employees, suppliers, lease or utilities with bitcoin. So if you started to see an influx of bitcoin revenue, you'd have to convert it to fiat to keep operating. This is one of the problems with gradual adoption of the system, it limits crypto to being a proxy for fiat.

until it suddenly crashes to 6k again.

why would I use something that I don't get paid in, can't access from my bank card, can't physically carry with me, 99% of merchants in the world don't accept, and buying power can radically vary from one day to the next?

What a moronic sentiment. You haven't given up on fiat, so your grandiose statement about going back to it is worthless. Fiat is still an integral part of your daily life. Without it you would be broke, homeless, and starving. Pull your head out of your own ass and stop thinking of yourself as one of the enlightened few. Crypto will never replace fiat as the standard, it will only ever be a speculative investment play for people who want to gamble.

yes, but the value of goods or services you can buy with 1 BTC fluctuates wildly. People who held hundreds of them when they were worth little probably deeply regret spending them. People who bought in at 10k+ with visions of Lambos in their heads are now wondering what the hell happened. Bitcoin will never be a stable currency as long as it is the speculator's playground.

What in the Kentucky Fried Fuck are you going on about? The USD is not going to deflate anytime soon. Nor are Euros, Pounds, Australian or Canadian Dollars, Yen, RMB, or currency of any top tier industrialized nation. Maybe in some post apocalyptic nightmare world, when civilization is crumbled and we're all fighting it out in Thunderdome, maybe then. But if that ever happens the internet will no longer exist anyway so virtual currencies will be even more useless than bank cards.

Venezuela's current situation is a result of decades of mismanagement, extreme corruption, nepotism, and bad trade relations. But wait, you may argue, all those things exist in America today. Maybe so, but the USA has a gigantic economy that generates wealth from a massive variety of goods &amp; services. Venezuela put all their eggs in the oil basket, and then fucked that up in the most epic way possible.

aaaaand it's gone.

The very fact you bought it as an investment shows that you fundamentally misunderstand it's purpose.
