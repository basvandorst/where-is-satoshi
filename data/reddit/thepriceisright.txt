The actual capital involved in the BTC market cap is estimated to be about 5-10%, that would mean $10-20B of fiat money has been exchanged for BTC. Tether makes up 10-20% of that alone...

Their audit report last year was a joke, it told us nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:33:25
All of this could be fixed if they would just release any proof that they actually audit their accounts and that Tether is in fact backed by USD, their refusal to do so just strengthens the argument against them. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:48:12
They're printing an insane amount of USDT and it's barely keeping the BTC price afloat, not a good sign, unless I'm overestimating Tether's effect on the price.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:04:36
Most of that is crypto/crypto volume.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:46:52
The difference between BCC and Tether is that BCC wasn't $2B of hard capital, around 10% or lower was actual capital injection. Tether is 100% acting as hard capital since it's mimicking USD so it's about 10x worse at the current moment and will get much worse if they keep recklessly clicking ENTER on "print 100M USDT".

If people put their money in tether and it collapses then that money becomes worthless and they're unable to buy bitcoin. I think there is no moving unless you move right now which is what's happening with today's candle. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:49:17
My bet, it's at 4450 right now, it's going to drop down to around 4250 then it will surge upwards to a new ATH 4900 and recover around 4700.

Most people can't be bothered to dig out their cold storage and go through the process to sell their bcash. I procrastinated doing it for a month. And then there's the people who keep it because 'whatever it was free, just in case'. And then the people who have it stuck on coinbase and other exchanges that still haven't added bcash withdrawls.

I don't think someone with that much money would resort to petty squabbles and arguments with low-tier youtube interviewers, like he has done numerous times, unless he is just a complete loser. With that much money he could've hired the best marketing minds to promote bcash while he sat in the background.
I think he's a moron who's managed to squander the majority of his wealth, and bcash is his way of trying to reclaim the power and wealth that could've been.
