Scam people 
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:25:07
So I won't get them? My bank just put it bank in my account no questions asked. Would they have contacted Coinbase and told them?
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:01:57
I accidentally bought 2 sets of $213 worth of bitcoins. I contacted my bank and they put my money back in my account. I was wonder if those will get. Cancelled but a lot of people said it can't be. Once it's bought it's bought? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:32:01
I just didn't want my BTC to be seized or something lol. You guys have me scared about Coinbase so I moved all my BTC 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:25:43
Because I don't really have my own computer 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:25:07
Anything for iOS?
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:01:26

@_date: 2017-07-12 02:12:22
Invest it in different things to be safe. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:27:37
I correct my statement of EVERYONE. But a lot of you guys are straight up assholes. Like why comment on my shit saying something stupid. Everyone else is trying to have a legitimate conversation. Go do something productive 
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:58:39
So a mobile app wallet like BitPay is not secure? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:55:32
I'm just asking for advice. Whys everyone on Reddit a smart ass ? ��
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:08:56
I only have 280 worth right now.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:22:53
Yeah I'm just going to wait it out. Hopefully I don't feel dumb if it keeps going and never stops 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:57:08

@_date: 2017-07-11 23:45:33
I didn’t watch the video but didn’t the site exit scam? Basically took everyone’s that had money on the sites wallets and left town? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:24:17
I think I'm just going to put a small portion of each pay check and see were it goes. I bought bitcoins in January for 120 and today it would of been worth 400+ but I sadly spent it lol. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:25:38
I gained some knowledge and advice. So I got what I wanted....
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:21:13
I started out at 200ish last month 
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:57:22
Whys that. I'm new to this whole things. Just trying to gain some knowledge and advice 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:06:38
I'm not too educated in this whole thing but I just started. Only have a small amount compared to what some of you guys may have but isn't there a possibility government could ban bitcoin? That's the only thing stopping me from investing more. I remember seeing someone say that it's a possibility that government could ban it and we would lose all of our money. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:14:04
I mean I honestly have no knowledge of this whole thing. But I do know the market fluctuates from time to time. Sometime it goes up other times it goes down. Back in January it was just passing 1000 now it's passing 3000. I'm just wondering if it's going to ever stop. I mean realistically it has to stop a certain point. It can't just get higher and higher
