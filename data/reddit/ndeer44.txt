That's why you wait for when there is less of a difference between gox and other exchanges. Last week gox was lower than coinbase. So at that time, use the cash in gox to re buy, transfer to coinbase and sell.

No, once you have the cash in gox you have made your profit.  Now once the price at gox is similar to bitstamp, regardless of the actual value you can essentially transfer that cash value to another exchange where you can withdraw. For example last week the value of coinbase, gox, and bitstamp were around 850

But if I instantly use the coin when I purchase on coinbase?

I didnt say to withdraw from gox. When the exchanges become closer like they were a few days ago, rebuy and transfer back to your exchange of choise, preserving your profit.

You keep assuming that the parity needs to happen at 1000. The parity can happen at any price so you can transfer from gox fiat to stamp fiat with just the 0.6% fee. The advantage of doing this is a GUARANTEED profit. The only disadvantage I see is that you need to wait until closer to parity, but that seems to be happening every week or so.

Not necessarily. Say there's that large gap and buy 10btc at 900 sell on gox for 1000 making 1000 profit.  Later in time, stamp and gox are close to each other(can be 900,1000,1100 all that matters is that there isn't a large gap) and then you rebuy at that new price, transfer back to stamp, sell, then withdraw instantly so that the $10,000 cash you had in gox can be put in your Bank without doing a gox cash withdrawl.
