Ok so basically they are listening for double-spending transactions and only confirm a transaction if it reached e.g. 90% of the nodes without any other transactions spending the same output?

I already put my BTC address on the invoice, and they tried to pay me in BTC but apparently it was too much of a hassle. I even gave them a 3% discount if they payed me in BTC. But honestly I can totally understand that they don't want to go through the whole verification process just for me.

Actually I wouldn't mind the 4%. Transferring USD to Switzerland, and then CHF to a Bitcoin exchange will cost me at least 4%. But 4% is still a lot...

So you're telling me that pools aren't maximizing their profit? That's very interesting. Don't you think it's only a matter of time until they do? At least that's what game theory would suggest
@_date: 2014-02-05 16:26:51
But don't pools prioritize transactions with higher fees in case there are two transactions with the same input? If that was the case, an attacker could broadcast a low-fee transaction, wait until the transaction was confirmed by BitPay, and then broadcast another transaction with a higher fee, which would replace the low-fee transaction. And if pools aren't prioritizing transactions with higher fees why don't they, it would clearly be the best strategy?

I hope you're joking. Markets don't work like that, there's no guarantee the price will ever be higher than what you paid. Sometimes the best you can do is sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 11:53:13
Exactly. And since the demand for BTC probably isn't very high in those countries, the price would be lower than in western countries, which means they would have to sell at a loss. The loss might even be higher than WE fees. 
As much as I would like to see Bitcoin succees in the remittances business, I just don't see it happening at this stage.

IMO Kraken is your best option right now. You can do a SEPA transfer to your Kraken account, which will only cost you 0.30 EUR. If you transfer EUR to bitstamp from a Swiss bank account you have to pay a $15 fee.

@_date: 2012-09-26 20:00:17
The bitcoin price is usually about 1-2% lower on bitstamp than on mtgox, so 10€ really isn't that bad. And I talked to their support recently and they told me they will soon offer a better solution for people living in the UK and Switzerland without the 15$ fee. (yeah it's 15$, not 10€, just remembered). 
@_date: 2012-11-15 15:53:57
Can you please answer me this: Assuming someone wrote a script that places a buy and a sell order every day. This person could then only fund the order if the bitcoin price significantly rises or falls and have kind of an insurance on the bitcoin exchange rate, on the cost of Bitcopia. Example: This morning I place a sell order for 10.5$, during the day the bitcoin price falls to 8$, so I simply fund the order and get a price of 10.5$ for the bitcoins that are actually worth 8$. The same could be applied with a buy order, when the bitcoin price rises. Am I wrong in my thinking?

@_date: 2012-12-18 07:06:52
I know this problem, it has happened to me too. 3 times actually. The bank closed my bank account after I explained them that I sell bitcoins. In one case I already sent the bitcoins and refused to give back the money (about 800$). I think they are still processing that case but a lady from the bank told me that if I sent my goods, and can't take them back, I can keep the money, since it's not my responsibility if someone falls for phishing.
I have to say that I was extremely surprised how many cases of "hacked" ebanking there are. I understand now that it's absolutely impossible for an exchange like mtgox to accept payments without any kind of identification, bitcoin is very attractive to wash your stolen money, and all the thieves out there are well aware of it.
@_date: 2012-11-15 09:37:47
You may be right, but this is not a p2p exchange but a centralized one. What other reference value than the MtGox exchange rate could he use?
@_date: 2012-07-05 09:57:33

You need to mine on GPUs, not CPUs. You can mine on CPUs, but even if you mine on 100 computers 24/7, you won't get more than a few cents a day. It's not even close to be profitable, because the computers use much more energy if their CPUs are under a 100% load all the time.

I haven't gotten my money back yet. I just checked my PayPal account and they CLOSED the claim! This is unbelievable, the seller didn't responde but still PayPal says they decided in the sellers favor after "careful examination of the case". Wow. Of course I reopened the case. Let's see what happens.
I was sure it'd be no hassle to get my money back since everybody is saying you can't sell bitcoins for PayPal because they will decide in favor of the buyer in case of a chargeback.

I have some questions:
1. Let's say I borrow 1000 USD to trade bitcoins. Then the bitcoin price goes down 50%. Does this mean the lender loses 500 USD? Or does a trader need to have some funds locked in case of losses to reimburse the lenders?
2. I don't understand how to trade at all, don't even know what to ask, I just don't get it.

Hey I'm with you. This subreddit was extremely biased, and it really annoyed me. Any criticism was downvoted, and completely unrealistic scenarios upvoted. I'm glad criticism is back now.
But you are acting like you know where bitcoin is going. Truth is, nobody does. I cashed out double of my initial investment, and I'm excited to see what happens next. I believe in the technology, I think bitcoin is absolutely amazing, and if all my coins lose their value, meh, I still made some good money.

That's not correct. The wallet is encrypted, blockchain can't spend your bitcoins. And you can always make a backup of the encrypted wallet, and import the keys to another client if blockchain is down. The part about their support is correct though.

To accept payments, you simply have to generate an address for each customer and somehow show the address on your webpage. You can then check for each address how many bitcoins were received and thus check whether the customer payed or not
Also, there are many API wrappers available, in many different languages. And there are bitcoind plugins for web frameworks such as Django or Ruby on Rails.
If you simply want to accept payments without any programming, check out BitPay or WalletBit. You could also check out the [blockchain.info merchant API](
Edit: I just assumed you want to accept payments on a website, and just realized you never mentioned "web". 
Edit 2: here's a list of the bitcoind commands:  . the command for generating an address is *getnewaddress*

So you're saying we should rely on the altruism of the bitcoin users/miners and *hope* they will always pay a transaction fee / only verify transactions with a minimal fee? That doesn't sound like very good mechanism design to me.
The system works right now because the block reward is still huge, but in the future, the miner's only incentive are the transaction fees. It's crucial for Bitcoins future that the fees are of substantial value.

No, it's not the same for miners, because confirming a transaction is free, a gallon of gas isn't. Also the cost of entry is a lot lower for bitcoin mining than for selling gas. I don't know what the margin on a gallon of gas is, but let's say it's 5%. So since we're comparing the mining business to the gas business: What's *practically free*+5%? Oh yeah that's right, it's *practically free*.
The equilibrium you're describing is not stable, therefore it's not an equilibrium. A miner could maximize his profits by verifying transaction with lower fees than his competitors, since any rational bitcoin user will pay the lowest fee possible. The only rational action of the other miners is to decrease their limit as well, or else they will miss out on a lot of transaction fees.

Please elaborate how hitting the transaction limit is such a bad thing? It would mean that there's a competition to get your transaction verified, and by paying a higher transaction fee, your transaction is more likely to be included in the next block. The amount of transaction fees payed has a direct impact of the Bitcoin system's security, since the transaction fees are the only incentive for miners in the future.

No, you only need very little bandwith to mine


No, after ASICs have shipped, difficulty will increase by a factor of maybe 50 (or 100, who knows) , so you will get 50 times less bitcoins than you would right now. The mining calculators are useless right now, because they do not take into account that the difficulty of mining will increase significantly in the following month due to ASICs. (if they ship, that is...)

Setting an arbitrary minimum transaction fee is certainly not the best solution.

I assume that hackers got access to ebanking accounts and then wired money on my bank account to wash it.

It still amazes me how many cases of "hacked" ebankings there are. The last two days I was in business I received 4 payments of such hacked ebankings. 
After the first case the bank contacted me and asked questions about a transaction I received. They then wanted to know in detail what I do and after a few hours they decided that they don't want me as a customer anymore, and closed my account. I have tried to open a new bank account, but no bank in Switzerland will allow it, they all say they don't want to be involved in this kind of business.

Carbonwallet is not a "web wallet" in the traditional sense. It can be run completely offline, it's basically Electrum that runs in your browser. No sensitive data is transmitted or stored on the server.
If OP creates the passphrase offline, his bitcoins are perfectly secure. The chance that someone cracks this wallet by bruteforcing the 128bit key is probably about a trillion times smaller than the probability of him dying in the next 2 seconds. Being paranoid with your bitcoins is a good idea, but for some people (including me) it doesn't matter if the bitcoins are 99.99999% or 99.99999999999% secure, at some point it's just ridiculous.

That's exactly my point that this will never happen. Verifying a transaction is practically free. Gavin Andresen calculated the cost for verifying a transaction in some thread, and it was 0.03 cents *for the whole network*. So, to repeat my point for the 10th time, it is rational for miners to verify *every transaction that has a non-zero transaction fee*. 
Players in a free market don't always act in the best interest of society. As an example: Fishermen are always trying to fish as many fish as possible, even though a lot more fish could be fished if they all agreed not to fish more than x kilos of fish per day. The same example can be applied for transaction fees. If every miner would enforce a minimum transaction fee, the total revenue of all miners would be higher. But since every miner is trying to maximize his profit, any rational miner would verify any transaction with a non-zero fee. This is called tragedy of the commons. You can read about it on wikipedia. It's basic game theory.

I don't get what you are saying. I'm also holding bitcoins. But I have to start decreasing risk. This miner is a risk, right now it's worth at least 30'000$, but if other companies start to make ASICs, or if the bitcoin price decreases, this device loses value. I made a choice whether to sell my bitcoins or this device, and I decided to sell the device, because I think the risk is larger. Also because I live in a tiny apartment and this ting is probably loud as hell.

That is only a question of how much risk you're willing to take. By investing everything at once, you increase the risk, but also increase the potential revenue of your investment. Nobody can answer this question for you, it depends solely on your personal risk aversion. Personally I think the best strategy to buy bitcoins is dollar cost averaging: Buy Bitcoins every month/week/day for X USD.


Like many other people here, I believe that the winner takes all, meaning the strongest cryptocurrency will ultimately drive all other cryptocurrencies out of business. We can already witness this with Litecoin that has lost a lot of value over the past months. But I'm not an oracle, I can't tell you the future, this is just my personal opinion.
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:32:19

Exactly. Let's say you want to invest $1000, then you buy bitcoins for $100 per month, for 10 month, regardless of the current bitcoin price. By that, you automatically buy a little more bitcoins if the price is low, and a little less if the price is high.

Yeah I can imagine an AltCoin having a purpose if it differs from existing coins, for instance Litecoin with a different hashing algorithm than Bitcoin. But most AltCoins are just copycats of existing coins, with one parameter slightly changed. E.g. Feathercoin is exactly the same as Litecoin, only the total amount of coins is different.
I would be very careful when investing in AltCoins. Pumping and dumping is a lot easier when the market cap is small, and I believe that's what's happening with most of these AltCoins right now.

You're right, the seller can't know whether the money is stolen or not. But I'm guessing that it's only a problem if you sell something that can easily be exchanged for money, like gold or bitcoins.
I have to say that I kinda understand that the bank closed my account, because every fraudulent transaction is a lot of work for them, the legal team needs to look into this and all.

It wouldn't make any difference right now, because the block reward is still huge. The problem lies in the future, when the block reward nears zero. The systems security is then directly dependent on the amount of transaction fees. If there is no strong incentive to pay a transaction fee, difficulty will drop to almost zero, thus the system will collapse.

Well guess what, I'm selling bitcoins for cash about once a week. So please explain me how they have "no value to the real world".


A friend once sent me about $1000 from the USA. This is what we had to do:
1. I had to find out the BIC code of my bank account. This code is not on my bank card, and I couldn't find it in my e-banking. Took me about 5 - 10 minutes to find it.
1. My friend had to go to his bank and fill out a piece of paper with my 21 digit EBAN and 11 digit BIC code, and my address
1. The transaction took a few days to come through
1. Total cost of the transaction was around $40, with crappy USD/CHF exchange rate of the bank even more
Be honest with yourself, do you *REALLY* think this is better than this?:
1. Scan QR-Code from computer screen
1. Press "send" button
If you tell me you prefer the bank wire, you're either lying or you're an idiot.


You either don't understand what a ponzi scheme is, or you didn't understand Bitcoin. There's really no difference in the gold market and the bitcoin market, except that the bitcoin market is a million times smaller. But the principle is pretty much the same.


Of course it's not magic, but it's ingenious. Satoshi has found a solution to a problem that was never solved before. You're acting like you could easily have solved this problem by yourself ages ago, which makes you look like an arrogant dick.

A double-spend does not happen in the same block. If someone tried to broadcast a block with the same outputs ocurring twice, all nodes would reject that block. 
But consider this scenario: An attacker could pay 1 BTC to address A. After 6 confirmations, the receiver would think that the coin is now in his posession. What he doesn't know is that after this transaction, the attacker forked the blockchain and was working on a malicious blockchain, where he spent the same coin to address B. Bevause the attacker has 51% of processing power, sooner or later his malicious chain will be longer than the real chain, making it the new valid blockchain. Address A doesn't have the coin anymore, even though he waited for 6 confirmations.
Does that make sense?

The other one is clearly a copy of my screenshot, because of that little blue edge you can see in the email field.

I'm not sure I understand your point. Maybe I should have been more clear about that: I'm not saying there's a problem right now, I'm talking about the future when the block reward is near zero. It's still a problem that needs to be resolved now.

Why would you recommend Bitcoin QT to a first timer? If he has an old computer and a slow internet connection it can take *days* to download the blockchain. That is a HUGE turn off for most people.

Actually I bought back in at around 16$ right after the "bubble" bursted, so it went pretty well. I believe in bitcoin, I'm in for the long term but when I feel that a price correction is happening, I'm selling and buy back in after the market calms down. I did the same a few days ago when the price was 48$ and bought back in at 42$. I know there is a risk that I'd have to buy back in at a higher price, but that's a rsik I'm willing to take.

They still have the largest volume by far, which IMO justifies the MtGox price as reference.

Don't panic. I experienced the same problem once, but after some time they were forwarded anyway.

Check out this blockchain.info API:  
This let's you create bitcoin addresses for each customer, and forwards the bitcoins to another address you specify. No need to register.

Here's two things I'm missing:
* A website that allows to place [conditional orders]( on MtGox. (People using the service would have to submit an MtGox API key for trading)
* A nice GUI for cgminer, ideally web based, so it could be accessed from anywhere. (If this already exists, please let me know!)
EDIT: Just re-read your post and realized I'm not really answering what you asked. It looks like you have very useful skills, I'm sure there is something that will help bitcoin much more than the above suggestions. I'm not deleting this post in hopes that somebody will see it and start working on the above suggestions.

Where do you see that price? It's wrong. Check bitcoinity.org/markets or bitcoin.clarkmoody.com

Thats what the BitStamp support told me a few months ago. Are you saying they found a new banking partner?
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:14:42
There's always a trade-off between security and usability.
Checking balance and making transaction is still possible though: You can always check your balance on blockchain.info, and you can make transactions by installing electrum on an offline computer, get your private keys with the passphrase, sign a transaction, and broadcast it on an online computer.

Glad to hear it worked out

Please stop drawing lines on charts and pretending to know the future. It is silly.

Can somebody explain to me what the difference between a "Linux computer" and any other computer is?
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:57:09
This is awesome. Only complaint is that it's not possible to send less than 10mBTC.

I don't know this client but probably because you received bitcoins and the incoming transactions are not confirmed yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:59:33
400 seconds lag :/ Looked like thousands of 0.02 btc orders to me.
EDIT: I wish I had some money on MtGox ready right now.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:49:46


That's exactly the problem. Confirming a transaction costs the *whole network* about 0.03 cents, distributed among miners it's practically zero. So the rational decision for every single miner is to accept every transaction that has a non-zero transaction fee. So basically this means that if every miner is acting rational and tries to maximize his profits, difficulty will decrease drastically. In game theory this is called [tragedy of the commons]( and it's not some abstract scenario, it happens all the time in today's economy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:21
That's actually pretty good advice. I'll probably do that. Let's hope BitStamp gets its shit together until MtGox opens again.

There is no economy for any other coin than Bitcoin or Litecoin. These AltCoins are purely for speculation, and sooner or later they will all die.

I approve of your setup, but your answer might confuse a first-timer. IMHO if you don't own more that a bitcoin, using cold wallets and two-factor-auth seems a bit over the top. As a first-timer reading your answer I would get the impression that blockchain.info is a terribly insecure website, and bitcoin is only for geeks.

Between $1 and $1000 (just a wild guess)
