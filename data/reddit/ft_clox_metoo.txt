Yes. People on MtGox dont trade Bitcoins but numbers on a screen. MtGox prices is so low because more and more people realised that there is no actual value backing MtGox. They are insolvent. If you deposit money in it you will never see it again.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:08:27
Its because on MtGox you trade numbers on a screen instead of real BTC. MtGox owns less Bitcoins than their customer base on MtGox "owns". 
This has become evident as soon as they limited BTC withdrawals like they did with fiat before.
As Andreas M. Antonopoulos said "Contrary to many news headlines that describe Transaction Malleability as a “bug” affecting bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, it is not."
The big problem you suspect is bankrupcy as soon as too many people withdraw fiat or BTC out of MtGox. Thats why they prohibit it.

They know exactlywhere the money is. The problem is that on their exchange you never trade actual Bitcoin. You trade numbers. Only when you withdraw fiat/Bitcoin you will get something out of it. The problem is that MtGox owns far less Bitcoin than their customers 'own' on their exchange, so they cant pay out everyone and the run out of money sooner or later.
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:02:13
Until MtGox is dead its a good idea to hold fiat and buy all coins back once the next Gox related crash is over.

Cash management, trade finance and trust and securities services. Basel III willl not harm everything in the same way, but certain transactions will be more expensive for banks, operational accounts, liquidity management and letters of credit will be more expensive.

I made the same experience with a lot of other companies that later became bankrupt. They blame 'technical issues' and provide no clear answer when you ask for more informationen. Everything MtGox is communicating is suspect to me. There is nor reason to be so unspecific about their problems, also IT guys that I asked about this say they cant think of any technical issue that could cause what MtGox is claiming. Even on r/Bitcoin some IT experts said that they dont believe MtGox.
The fact that until recently only small amouts of BTC could be withdrawn looks like a strategy that banks used during all crises in the past 100 years. 
All these things make scared. That is all.

I always kept saying that its better to keep the Bitcoin and not exchanging it to fiat because the expected return in case they are not completetly bankrupt is higher.

* why you bought (or didn't buy) bitcoin
Implications of near-zero transaction costs, fast secure payments, etc. made it very attractive. I know how transaction banking works and I find it very inefficient, even in central Europe. I lived in several countries in Europe and Russia and international money transfers are inexplicably beaurocratic and costly in my opinion. Also costly. A transaction cost free medium of exchange will make everyone richer, as companies can lower their prices. This benefits entire countries. Had to go some time without food for a day once because I had to wait until money was transferred. 
* whether you're purely speculating on its price or whether you're using it to buy and sell goods
Both, but 95% of my activities with Bitcoin can be described as speculation. I simply cant spend Bitcoin anywhere in my current country of residence.
* how important online privacy is to you
Irrelevant. There is no such thing.
* where you see Bitcoin in six months
Above $1000 as current hardships will translate into vast improvements at many corners within the Bitcoin economy. However, I am certain that by then Bitcoin will be regulated in one way or the other by several countries. Money laundering allegations originating from its pseudonymous nature will be most crucial to that regulation efforts.
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:57:05
Thats the next fucking wrong shill statement of you. 
"still readily available - just at a premium cost." 
How can it have a premium cost if the buyers market completely collapses and you cant use it for 99.9% of the goods and services in an economy? Its precisely the opposite which will happen. It will be woth less than $10 then.
"Bitcoin will change the way the financial system runs."
How? It doesnt have any such characteristics that would imply any change in the financial system. Other than lower transaction costs it has nothing to offer. On the contrary, it has serious flaws as it doesnt allow fractional reserve banking, loans or the like and takes (from a transaction perspective) extremely long to exchange (10 minutes per confirmation) which makes it useless in stock trading or anything related to finance. Its just fucking internet money. Nothing more, nothing less.

You clearly have no idea about the massive anti-money laundering infrastrucure in place and how much this actually prevents, which all can be bypassed by bitcoin. This is why bitcoin will be banned or regulated heavily in
 the near future.

DONT listen to the shills here that try to convince you to sell your Bitcoins. 
You already paid for them and you bought them in good times, so you didn't use money that you needed back then. 
Just think about what will happen if you sold your BTC now and soon the price will go up substantially. You will loose out on all the gains that you will definately profit from in the future.
If the price goes down, you lost money you could afford to use. 
Your current financial situation should not force you into liquidating your investment in BTC. There are always tons of other things you can do to obtain more funds in order to cope with your current situation.
Even getting a loan or asking family members or friends for support will give you the freedom to cope with your current situation and pay back in better times when you got a job again. First think of all the things you and your girlfriend could do to obtain liquidity. Better sell some things or luxury goods that you have and dont depend on.

First of all, I find it fascinating how you belive bankrupcy works. In case of an (now unlikely) MtGox bankrupcy their remaining assets are still there and you can sue them for that. Which will give you the same amount of money back as when you sue them now.
* if MtGox suddenly goes offline and/or files bankruptcy, then we will never get our money back as we bought bitcoins with it.
Yes you do. Thats how bankrupcy works, you will be able to sue them for their remaining assets. So you will get something back when they file for bankrupcy or insolvency.
What you are doing is taking away all of their ability to fix the current situation, you would butcher them and take out a tiny piece of what is left and the rest would rot. 
What you are doing is attempting to get that little money that you have in MtGox back while damaging the whole community and sending all other exchanges down to (most likely) below $300 on Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc. with the panic you are creating. So you will cause losses for all other people who didn't use Gox despite the hundreds of warnings about MtGox that everyone knew about for months.
So you would cause everyone losses just to get some of your money back. You would cause one of the biggest reputational damage cases that would be reported all over the media and throw back the whole Bitcoin community back for years just to get some of your money back. Youre doing all this at the expense of all of us.

Other things you talk about are speculation and thoughts, which this subreddit is the right place for. 
But I agree that the "the big banks are all evil and want to X" is quite annoying. 
Also, the karma thing here on Reddit prevents logical discussion because any unwanted opinions get downvoted and a massive filter bubble is being created where people like Imperial Jedi can claim that Bitcoin will replace all currencies and if I am saying that there is a potential problem with money laundering laws that could cause regulation, I'm getting downvoted into oblivion.

Hold Bitcoin. The expected payoff is higher if the somehow manage to survive. If they go bankrupt it doesnt matter if you are holding fiat or BTC, but if there is some way they find to survive all this, you will be happy to hold Bitcoin that you bought really cheap.
The vast amount of OTC offers to sell MtGox Bitcoin cheaply to other people on forums like bitcointalk lets me believe there is some insider knowledge better than mine or speculation of people with a lot of money going on.

The default of MtGox was priced in in the $400 range and uncertainty kept it down. Now that MtGox is finally dead, the reason that kept back Bitcoin is gone and the remaining Bitcoin Economy is still very much intact and growing therefor there is no reason for the price to stay at lower levels. At the moment nothing is keeping us back anymore until we hear about what form regulation will take or whether certain countries limit the Bitcoin economcy again.

[Part 2]
At the "mining" of Bitcoins, so I keep hearing arises yet again money out of nothing and thus the next financial bubble! But the reverse is the case.
Just cryptographic money as Bitcoin just can not simply be scooped by the award of a loan out of nowhere, but only by the extremely complex mathematical calculation checksums. The existence of this Bitcoins can be clearly demonstrated and it can not be copied or otherwise propagated away with. This is a serious counter-model to use today money is also primarily virtually exists in computers, but is drawn through simple typing a sum in the computer in lending.
The maximum producible amount of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million. Conventional money, however, is almost any inflationary - it creates an ever-growing mountain of debt that forces us to constant economic growth and caused the increasing exploitation of people and the planet.
Not enough Bitcoins?
The cap on the maximum amount producible Bitcoin raises many cases the question of how a world economy Bitcoin - purely hypothetically - accepted as a stateless currency, should make do with the small amount of 21 million. This overlooks: Bitcoin users expect mostly in Mikrobitcoin (μBTC, one millionth of BTC, more recently, often called "Bit"). Occasionally one Bitcoins named Satoshi (the hundred millionth of a Bitcoins) is also expected in the smallest possible unit. Therefore, the theoretical maximum producible amount of Satoshi is 2.1 times 10 to the 15, or 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi (in U.S. number 2.1 quadrillion conductor). What brings us to another interesting aspect: the potential future value of Bitcoins.
Volatile, but interesting: The BTC-rate against the U.S. $ 2009 to 2014
The potential value of Bitcoins
The total value of the money in circulation worldwide can be difficult to quantify. The so-called M2 money supply (cash, accounts and savings deposits) but accepted U.S. dollars with about 60 trillion (in number of American conductor trillion) - which is slightly more than the amount of the gross world product. 
In the next ten years, cryptographic keys are of about 18 million Bitcoins be calculated ("mined"). Because people tend to save money and to hoard, we assume that 18 million BTC only 6 million will be in circulation. Suppose that Bitcoin until then to ten percent of the global currency market reached. This would result in a market capitalization of $ 600 billion to U.S. $ 6 trillion - and in this case would be worth 100000-1 million dollars a Bitcoin.
Purchases we would pay in μBTC and Satoshi. Merchants interested in such a future, because during the checkout process with Bitcoin the 3-4% credit card processing fee will be invisible, they have to pay today. The frequently expressed fear that hoarding of Bitcoin would lead to deflation, I think is unfounded. The higher the value of Bitcoins rises, the more merchants and eBay users will seek to get even a few of our Satoshi.
The marijuana vending machines in Colorado accept already incidentally also Bitcoin.
Of course, the idea of ​​Bitcoin as stateless reserve currency may also fail terrific. This is probably especially if something better enforcement. Because the source code of the software was disclosed from the beginning, already exist alternatives to Bitcoins - many so-called "Altcoins" vie for the attention of the users. Some of them wait quite innovative concepts , others with dogs and cats . Even if Bitcoin fails as a currency, the procedure used in Bitcoin protocol solution model cryptographic peer-to-peer currency will continue to exist. This genie is out of the bottle.

Dogecoin is one of the more humerous Bitcoin clones and is mainly used by a young, motivated Reddit community for donations. You helped among other things the Jamaican bobsled team to participate in the Olympic Winter Games.
Software developers recognize it when they have a new useful Internet protocol before him. Just as we could hardly foresee YouTube and Facebook in the early Web-nineties, are building new applications where the Bitcoin technology is availed in unforeseen ways. The pseudonymous traceability of the information units in the Bitcoin network may be, for example, used to detect the emergence of so linked documents. Also the whole chapter micropayments will hopefully be rewritten in the next few years - payment systems for apps and in-app purchases should be based on open source principles, not companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft are left. Bitcoin as a protocol, ie as the basis for applications today, however, is in its development only where the World Wide Web was in the early nineties.
Cryptographic peer-to-peer money is the bottom-up alternative to centralized top-down model of money present. With this paradigm shift to fear bank owners because they their primary business model - see under threat - the creation of money from nothing. Also an essential addition to the Bank's business, offsetting high fees for accounts and (slow) transfers is jeopardized by the crypto money. The non-banking activities of the population should have every interest that permeated Bitcoin or one of its open source offspring.

* We all owe MtGox for having the strong BTC-Community today!" 
No we dont. MtGox was a first mover and other exchanges were already on its way too. It just so happened that MtGox won that race but if a better exchange would have won, we would have had a lot less troubles. What Karpeles did rips a huge hole into the Bitcoin community and the reputational damage he has done will kick us back for years. 
* If it wasn´t MtGox Bitcoin might have died in 2011 or 2012. 
Incorrect. Other players in the market would have done the same. 
* None of those haters show their face! 
Come to Germany and I'll show you my fists too.
* So I call upon all Non-Haters. Support MtGox as good as you can. We should not leave behind one of the leaders of our community injured and wishing him awful things, because he failed. Stop stabbing a bleeding who is lying on the floor you cowards. Reach your hand in whatever form and help him up and take back the place he deserves.

The market assumes that insiders will know about developments with MtGox earlier than the rest of the market participants. Before the last bit decrease huge sell orders could be seen some time before MtGox postet their news uptdate.

Andreas Antonopolos says MtGox works like a fractional reserve system. They own much less Bitcoin than people trade on their exchange. Now imagine what will happen if they allow withdrawals and everyone wants to get their Bitcoin out because the prices are much higher at other exchanges. Thats right, if MtGox allows withdrawals they will be bankrupt.

Listen Hermann, HSBC is a single example in a world where trillions of $ are transferred and processed everyday. I work in the financial industry and had to do specialised money laundering training too. There is a massive infrastructure and law body in place to prevent any possible kind of money laundering, and Bitcoin makes things possible that these rules and techniques are made for to prevent. 
This is why Bitcoin will either be heavily regulated (and no longer be Bitcoin) or outright banned. There is NO way around it. It must happen and it will happen. We are now witnessing the beginning of that process and I am not sure if there will be a Bitcoin in existance by the end of it. 
And on a side note: This subreddit is the worst place I can think of and the community is just plain shit. People ask how they can start mining and nobody warns him that he will loose money. Shills downvote any criticism. People are over-positive because of karma prostitution. 
And frankly, youre one of the bad apples, I know of other comments by you. You just proved it by saying "You can't regulate it, it's like trying to regulate the internet. It's theoretically possible, but very difficult to implement. People will circumvent and find a way."
(Which is of such massive proportions of stupidity it actually hurts me when I read it.)
bollekegekapt has the perfect answer:
"Ban mining (Russia just did this), Ban banks/processors from sending money to exchanges (China is doing this), Ban exchanges altogether (and face jail if you don't comply with their AML rules), etc. 
Also, it's very likely that consumers won't be able to use bitcoin to make payments higher than $5k, just like cash. Businesses will have to report it, and they will."
So go on and downvote and continue living in your dream world where nothing negative about Bitcoin ever gets trough "New" here.

Do not get scared by the current situation. Bitcoin offer almost-zero transaction costs in a world where Paypal and credit cards dominate the Internet. If you dont find intrinsic value in Bitcoin, then find it in a million companies that save on every little transaction those 2-6% which are currently present. Which are billions per year.

bank run does not have to refer to banks.
get your facts right.
Also, every single thing in MtGox behaviour recently looks like they fear a bank run in the sense of an excess of withdrawals from their platform. Literally 100% of their behaviour indicates that while I do not know of any plausible cause that could lead them to act like this if it wasnt for fear of a bank run.

I got convinced about what MtGox behaviour will be 3-4 weeks ago and I was right. Now I am collecting data which this great subreddit is providing me (amongst other sources of course) and I begin to believe that Gox is not dead, but in a coma.
I have been right many times, but this gives me 0% credibility. Even being right millions of times does not give me credibility. 
All I know is that I was right way too fucken often and I hope for all the MtGox customers that I will be right this time too. Which means Gox is not dead and within 4 months people will get an unspecified percentage of their money back.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:20:27
you dont understand how exchanges work. you dont actually trade bitoins there, you only get them when you withdraw. so there is no way for Gox tu buy bitcoins from its customers.

You DONT buy Bitcoin on MtGox you ONLY buy numbers on a screen. The Bitcoins that customers trade dont exist, MtGox owns Bitcoins in their wallet and they never move until a customer withdraws them. Only when you withdraw you will really own Bitcoins, but you cant withdraw anyways.
Meaning that its impossible that MtGox buys Bitcoins at reduced prices.

Bought at various prices ranging from 7.18€-733.00€. 
My holdings would account for 8% of my net worth and due to the great performance in 2013 its by far my best investment. I have stop loss orders at 400€ which will leave me with a profit no matter what. 
If I would have more % of net worth in BTC I would not be able to think clear anymore due to that volatility and the crazy fact that all exchanges are open 24/7. I think Americans slept during most of the large downward movements. Poor guys. 
Stop loss orders work like sleeping pills in that case.

I also said, I am not certain it was something like double-spending, but people told me they they suspect it might have been something like that. The customers were American tourists, who know who those people were and how they did it. 
The flaws are that volatility inhibits liquidity management and payment infrastructure is not yet fully secured. 
Thats why we dont use Bitcoin at the moment until volatility becomes less (the past few days were actually pretty stable, even enough to allow proper liquidity projecting) and we get something like bitpay running. However I dont want to convert BTC into fiat. 
Lower transaction costs are good but the low volume in BTC sales in my business doesnt allow me to have an advantage, as volatility sometimes eats up all tranaction cost benefits.

I try that again: You &gt;DONT&lt; buy Bitcoins on MtGox. You trade numbers. You only receive real Bitcoins when you withdraw. So MtGox and MtGox employees cannot buy Bitcoins on their own exchange, as they could only give from their own wallets to themselves. They can only buy BTC from other people/exchanges. Which they wont because the price is much higher.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:40:20

Only that its not possible to buy cheap coins because on exchanges you dont trade bitcoin, you only trade numbers on a screen. the coins are in wallets and you only own them when you withdraw. so no way for gox to buy them cheap, because they would only buy tokens, while the amount of btc in their wallets would never change.

The design looks like it will overheat after 10 minutes and I dont see how the cards in the middle are properly cooled, other than the 120/140mm fan at the bottom (which is not enough). Also there is no information given about the hashrate. 
Its definately now meant to mine Bitcoin, as 6 GPUs will get you 1 Bitcoin every 10.000 years or so. It looks like an expensive piece of Altcoin mining gear which they let other people finance by indigogo and then sell highly overpriced to newbs.
* Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and many others have been in the headlines for what seems like an eternity now - but surprisingly not a single reputable PC case company has come to the table with dedicated cases that have been optimized and tailored for mining - and those few "cases" (mostly cobbled together using a complex and confusing series of metal rods) that do exist are extremely expensive for what you receive, difficult to assemble, and the majority of them are a complete eyesore.  Because of the cost vs. value of what is currently on the market, some people have even gone so far as to use modified milk crates and clothing racks to house their mining rigs.  Dopamine aims to solve this problem.
Yeah. Fucking bullshit. My miner runs for years and its an ugly piece of computer guts which i keep in my basement. DopaMine is a fucking scam.

My business in Germany (Berlin) stopped accepting them. It is horrible to offer goods and services for Bitcoin at the moment. From a liquidity management perspective the price volatility is too big of a problem to accurately predict and manage cash along the value chain. Couldn't afford to pay my supplier once, because I allocated Bitcoin to cover his account and the price went down massiveley until I wanted to realize the payment. So I had to add fiat to it. The price of BTC increased again a few days after i sold them, so I actually lost quite a bit of money because of BTC.
Also several people got away with unconfirmed payments. The average waiting time for confirmations is so god damn long that everyone got away at least 10 minutes before I figured out that they double spent the coins between their own adresses just before paying me.
Fucking horrible. Cost me hundreds of €.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:40:01

You are all making a huge mistake if you sue MtGox. As much as I want Mark Karpeles to suffer, if you manage to freeze MtGox assets you are damaging the Bitcoin Community as a whole. 
Also, you are throwing away the chance of MtGox recovering or receiving a bail out (which is highly likely), in which case you get a lot of your money back, for the chance to get pennies on the dollar back while paying for a overeas lawsuit for the next couple of years, damaging the whole bitcoin community and throwing us all back for months or years.

FT_clox_metoo 9 points 35 minutes ago
So your solution to the current situation is making it worse for everybody by increasing the financial troubles MtGox is having, instead of letting people work on finding a solution?
You will kill off MtGox, freeze their assets so all customers of MtGox will be damaged and send the price of Bitcoin towards lowest levels in months while all newspapers in the world will write about your lawsuit and the whole Bitcoin community will have to live with the reputational damage you will cause?
We-Are-Suing-MtGox[S] 2 points 28 minutes ago
We don't know even know if we will get anything back at all. If we act now, there is a chance we might get some of OUR money back. If we wait too long, and MtGox files bankruptcy or suddenly goes offline, then it will be harder to act as by that point, all their assets could be gone. Including our money AND bitcoins.
Everyone in our group wants one thing: our money back. To us, it's not 'a game' anymore. If MtGox does go bankrupt, we will lose our money, which will cause real financial troubles. Do you think people who have invested a lot of money into an exchange which is about to go bankrupt, care about media coverage? We are already experiencing the negative consequences of MtGox's poor management and probable bankruptcy. You will never know how it feels like when you're about to lose tens of thousands of dollars.
I read some reports about MtGox reinstating withdrawals. Well, nothing of that is true (unfortunately). I tried it several times a day this week, without success. To us, the bitcoin price on MtGox doesn't really matter anymore.
We don't take the risk to buy bitcoins on MtGox, even if it is only worth $10. Because if we do buy bitcoins on MtGox when they are $10, and if MtGox suddenly goes offline and/or files bankruptcy, then we will never get our money back as we bought bitcoins with it. So everyone is staying in USD, the bitcoins on MtGox don't really matter anymore...

FT_clox_metoo 3 points 20 minutes ago
First of all, I find it fascinating on how you belive bankrupcy works. In case of an (now unlikely) MtGox bankrupcy their remaining assets are still there and you can sue them for that. Which will give you the same amount of money back as when you sue them now.
Quote: "if MtGox suddenly goes offline and/or files bankruptcy, then we will never get our money back as we bought bitcoins with it."
Yes you do. Thats how bankrupcy works, you will be able to sue them for their remaining assets. So you will get something back when they file for bankrupcy or insolvency.
What you are doing is taking away all of their ability to fix the current situation, you would butcher them and take out a tiny piece of what is left and the rest would rot.
What you are doing is attempting to get that little money that you have in MtGox back while damaging the whole community and sending all other exchanges down to (most likely) below $300 on Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc. with the panic you are creating. So you will cause losses for all other people who didn't use Gox despite the hundreds of warnings about MtGox that everyone knew about for months.
So you would cause everyone losses just to get some of your money back. You would cause one of the biggest reputational damage cases that would be reported all over the media and throw back the whole Bitcoin community back for years just to get some of your money back. Youre doing all this at the expense of all of us.

@_date: 2014-02-10 09:42:28
Listen, based on all the information we have and by asking experts about the situation as well as comparing the pattern of behaviour with historical events that caused companies to become illiquid, it looks highly likely to me that MtGox could be illiquid and therefor on the brink to bankrupcy.
I personally hope that this is not the case but I try to stay rational and use the little evidence I have as well as asking people who are experts on the subject. I work in a large financial firm and therefor have the opportunity to ask for certain peoples opinion on this. Based on what they tell me, it does not look good. 
Lets hope that my suspicion is wrong.
Addendum: MTGox just hit $622 for a minute while Bitstamp/BTC-e are around $700. Watch closely! Maybe we get updates on MtGox's status soon.

@_date: 2014-01-21 12:47:52
The problem is actually that I got really angry about Bitcoin in the past few days and I started using this account to insult and troll a little in order to get rid of my anger. I lost a lot of money and everybody on this subreddit is still blindly happy and positive about Bitcoin's future, even though I had serious problems. 
When I started talking about those issues I got downvoted into oblivion. Same happened when I warned two redditors who wanted to start mining BTC with USB Miners and a Radeon. Downvotes until nobody could see the warnings.
Anyways, I dont want the negative things I did with this accoung reflect back on my business. When I tell you the things my business does, its easy to identify me. Sorry.

Because banks represent the centralized model of finance, whereas Bitcoin - especially once it adds additional features that are currently in development (Sidechains, Ethereum features, etc.) represents the decentralized alternative to it. At least in my view.

I am telling people constantly about the massive anti-money laundering infrastructure and laws in the world and that Bitcoin can do things that bypass the whole concept of anti-money laundering.
This is in fact the biggest threat to Bitcoin. I am 100% certain that this will be a major issue in the near future and Bitcoin will most likely be heavily regulated or banned.
Governments do an awful lot in order to prevent money laundering. So why should anyone assume that they will just let Bitcoin exist next to the huge anti-money laundering efforts they have in place.

Its value is based on a normally distributed random walk process, meaning that its price changes constantly for no fucking reason.

Also, I will never tell you how many GoxCoins there are and you can mine it exclusively with the hardware of coffee machines.

In this case the messages I have been seeing around Reddit gave the impression that all banks have closed their accounts, when in reality it was just one. Huobi for instance closed their account themselves (only deposits, withdrawals are still possible) but still have several other banks and deposit methods open. 
So its some FUD.

He caused some people to stay with Gox and other to join Gox with his statement about Gox's solvency.

I dont believe there is a conceivable way cryptocurrencies will actually replace fiat but there is certainly a big role for them in the future. We finally have that technology and I would love nothing more than having Bitcoin as a competitor to national currencies. 
Replacing fiat will not be possible due to natural constraints. A medium of exchange must exist physically too, not only online. There is a role for both.

I said it before and I say it again. 
This subreddit has the collective mind of a 12 year old and it downvoted anything that the 12 year old doesnt like. 
All my criticism and warnings concerning MtGox have been downvoted until no one could see it anymore. Everywhere I encountered "everything is fine with MtGox" shills. Even today, when I said the price will hold at 700$ (which it did right at that moment and ever since) it got downvoted.

I live in the capital city of a Central European country. I personally believe there could be a large market for Bitcoin here in a few years. Currently there are only two companies accepting Bitcoin in the entire city and no Bitcoin ATMs.
Me and my friends could start a business and work on it next to our jobs, develop it and maybe work on it full-time after some time. What would be your advice?

Only that it wasnt. It was about speculating that there is no conceivable technical issue which could have caused Gox's claimed "technical problems" and that the pattern looks like they are close to illiquidity. 
People who start thinking about that possibility have a higher chance of preparing themselves with e.g. stop losses or sells. But this cant happen as long as this subreddit is biased, karma-prostituting and housing fake accounts who fight the truth.

If you put that much money into an exchange and never considered to question it, you deserve to lose your money.

They get some things right. Most of the things they talk about are BS though if you ask me. The comparison between Gold and Bitcoin is a joke. Then there are things like "people actually want governmental control of the money supply." 
And then there is this part:
Allison Nathan: Do digital currencies really provide an escape 
from government? 
Eric Posner: There is a real irony here in that history is repeating itself. Back in the 1990s everybody was talking about the internet as this great force for freedom. People thought that they would be able to communicate with each other without government control, that they would be able to criticize the government, and that they would be able to engage in transactions that the government could not stop. But as we have learned from Edward Snowden, the government controls the internet. It is a big piece of hardware that the government can tap into and use to learn things about people. 
Even when you use sophisticated cryptography, the NSA always seems to be one step ahead of you. So the internet empowered the government rather than citizens. Now, 20 years later, people are saying the same thing about Bitcoin that had been said about the internet. I am therefore skeptical about the idea that Bitcoin is liberating and allows people to evade government control.

So and what are the direct consequences for finance then? What are the benefits it offers to loans, mortgages, derivatives, stock trading? What does open-sourced, decentralized, democratic value tracking and transfer system imply? Those things are its characteristics but what benefits are they giving you? Its just another form of money. The only distinguishing benefit is that it eliminates transaction fees or strongly reduces them.
There is virtually nothing else.

Yes of course, in that direction we saw significant innovation. I am not so sure if it is correct to say that these developments work at the expense of the public as thanks to it, markets got a lot more efficient and hedging risks much more easily available. Significant cost savings achieved by innovation translated into direct cost savings for other companies, which in turn reduced consumer prices strongly. 
On this site you cant say that banks make money at the expense of the public. The opposite is true, they benefit us.
However, when we look at transaction banking, especially global/international transaction banking, the picture looks different. The fees and the complexity of online or international payments is just not necessary anymore, but is kept alive to make money. This happens at the expense of the public.

Everyone is holding coins because they believe they will be worth $40000/BTC in a couple of years.
Also, If you want more volume, convince exchanges to finally switch to µBTC. Every company in the world (excluding Berkshire Hathaway) are doing stock splits when they get high share prices, because we know that people buy more of the same at ranges between $40-$80 per share than they do at $500 or so.

That sounds promising. So they are currently working on it and we can publicly watch it. I have seen severl MtGox test withdrawals and some people who withdrew fiat (USD only?) in January got their money now.
Now if that is all true, we could expect them to allow limited withdrawals soon and with is, the current panix on Gox will be resolved slowly?

Incorrect. Before the landlord would set up a bitpay account he would rather ask OP to convert his BTC to GBP and just give him the money directly. Why should the landlord convert the BTC when the OP could do it too?

Thank you for the info! Here is the text for poeple who dont use Chrome:
[Part 1]
Why do we need Bitcoin
Or: How Money ensteht and an alternative.
Since a few years, I always wonder that many people do not know how new money is actually drawn. Try it out and ask your friends: "How is new money?" Besides a lot of shrug you will probably get the answer "the National Bank prints it." Or even "the government does it" and "it is earned."
The correct answer is: 
New money is created when a bank loan is.
This can be a national bank, the People's Bank, or the Postal Savings Bank in the village. New money is added to the circuit by an employee of the bank enters the equivalent in a computer. The Bank therefore does not need the savings account of another customer to pick up from its vault - but it creates money out of nothing.
In Europe, the bank has only one percent of the loan amount deposited as so-called minimum reserve with the National Bank - for a loan of EUR 10 000 so only 100 euros. Even this amount, they can be organized as a loan with another bank. The minimum reserve system is the standard not only in Europe but worldwide.
It is true that central banks such as the ECB control the amount of money generated by credit - but mainly by changing the percentage of the reserve (before 2011 it was two instead of one per cent) and by increasing the interest rates that they charge banks for loans: keep then the banks with the raising of loans tended to forgive and therefore even less credit.
Maybe it's bank owners not entirely wrong that a majority of people do not know that new money is created by the forgiveness of credit. To create money out of nothing is ultimately the most lucrative business model in the world. Unfortunately, it also means that more and more debt and interest to be served, the economy must continue to grow and the gap between lenders (rich) and borrowers (poor) continues to rise. The less people see through that allegedly borrowed money is actually created out of nothing, the better for the banks.
The common use today money has not kept pace with the possibilities and the speed of the Internet: transfers take days and cause high costs. Banks are extremely poorly networked and companies like Western Union or PayPal little customer friendly. New solutions are needed. Humanity has in the history of money repeatedly reinvented - from shells and coins over paper to data on accounts and plastic cards. Cryptographic peer-to-peer currency Bitcoin as is the most recent development in the history of money. At its realization has been researched for two decades prior to the introduction in 2009.
The basic idea is a kind of e-cash, which can be transmitted from user to user as an e-mail - directly, quickly and without a bank. The two users do not know each other.
So I have for example Bitcoin worth 100 euros on my computer. Now I transfer this information to your computer and the value belongs to you while he is gone from my computer. The shipment of the value held free and no bank, PayPal or Western Union within a few seconds. The future importance of this new technology is perhaps clearer if one raises the following question: What is more prevalent in our lives, e-mail or money?
That one ship with Bitcoin value may be similar to an e-mail and the more on that in a Netzwek gleichberechtiger users (peers) is noteworthy because it is indeed in the nature of the Internet, that data can be easily copied. So how do you avoid that digital money will simply be copied and sent multiple fraudulently?
Scientists have twenty years research on the solution of this problem, which is sometimes referred to as the 'problem of Byzantine Generals, "used in computer science. In this scenario, the generals besieging a city and have to reach an agreement, when they attack together. Send each other messengers with messages. However, the messenger could make mistakes and it is also possible that there are traitors among the generals who intentionally pass on false information. Transferred to the Internet is the problem: How can I in a peer-to-peer network information, the value represent reliably transmitted to another person?
Actually, the most important: Bitcoin as a protocol
Is Ensures reliable transmission thanks to a new communication protocol, so the actual technology of Bitcoin. The Internet as we know it today is based on a variety of protocols, such as HTTP for the World Wide Web, POP / SMTP for e-mail, TCP / IP to connect to our router and computer. The importance of Bitcoin as a new protocol can not be overestimated. I will come back later again.

The fact that Bitcoins are currently often perceived skeptical and sensationalist in the public debate is also due to the vivid but misleading terms that have been established for technically complicated procedures: for example, the term "mining". He awakens the wrong associations of greedy gold miners exploited miners and quick riches.
A Bitcoin users, the "mine" on his computer allows the mining software actually does two things: the cryptographic verification of the transactions of other bitcoin users and to create new cryptographic keys. Bitcoin enables reliable transfer of value between equal peers namely because it uses encryption to extremely high levels. Currently, the network of Bitcoin user has more computing power than the 500 strongest supercomputers in the world.
For the computation time, the network provides the individual Bitcoin users aka "Miner", he will receive rewards - fractions of an emerging cryptographic money. So it would make more sense, rather than to speak of "mining" of the care of the Bitcoin system.

Pragmatism between decentralization and some sort of centralization is what will make Bitcoin the future. I can see it clearly. The Internet itself is the same thing and it works extremely efficient like that.

Why are you finished with Bitcoin when its clearly your behaviour that cause you loose your Bitcoins at every point. Everyone knows its risky and that you are supposed to keep your money in a save place. Especially when you have this amount of money in Bitcoin.

They deserve to die. I have never seen more disgusting lies. "Technical issue" "we have to hold all withdrawals so we can understand the withdrawal problem better."

Taxes, funding for organized crime, drug money, illegal activities, terrorism finance. 
9/11 cost $500k, the terrorist acts in London and Madrid less than $10.000.
If it wasnt for anti-money laundering I would pay a hell of a lot less taxes.

Thats easy for you to ask. Sorry I did not yet obtain MtGox bank statements but every single piece of information we have is strongly indicating bankrupcy. Plus I have some sources who tell me how bad it really is. They post the opposite of what they tell me in the trollbox as we speak.

Can you fucking stop shilling?
Pot has a premium price because its illegal and poeple WANT IT. New equilibrium with laws in place, so prices go up.
Bitcoin has no use (or very very limited use) if illegal  and people will NOT WANT IT. Its market will be gone, the benefits useless, price will go all the way down.
Also, processing speed of transaction is based on the miners network and the confirmations. Fiat money does that in a fraction of a second, Bitcoin takes 10 minutes (if lucky). The Bitcoin infrastructure is not made to be as fast as fiat and it never will be.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:29:39
* You never trade Bitcoin on MtGox. You only trade numbers on a screen. When you buy Bitcoin on MtGox you dont own Bitcoin, you just own a claim that MtGox will give you Bitcoin when you withdraw them. 
* MtGox owns far less Bitcoins than its costumer base thinks  they "own". Therefor if too many people withdraw either too much fiat or too much Bitcoin, MtGox is bankrupt. 
Thats why they made both withdrawal types impossible.
* They dont even use arbitrage at the moment to exploit the huge price differential. This implies that they dont have any money left to do so.

Prices will go up dramatically on MtGox, as the fear of bankruptcy will diminish within the Bitcoin community and this may prevent many from withdrawing from MtGox. However, If you bought at $130 and sell at 600$ at Bitstamp you'll want to do that instead of keeping them on Gox.

People are delusional about MtGox. They are god damn broke. They cant pay most of their customers back because they dont have the fiat AND the dont actually have enough Bitcoin.
What does it tell you that not so long ago the price on MtGox went above $1000 while the other exchanges were at $800. Those were the rats leaving a sinking ship. Insiders or people who understood the financial problems soon enough.

Bruce, I never said I think that those things could have prevented 9/11 but have a look at the tons of new money laundering laws that followed this event.
Taxes, organized crime and drug money are significant and a very big focus of governments accross the world. Bitcoin makes money laundering easier and therefor it is threatened. 
I think I am going to submit my thoughts to this soon to r/Bitcoin. I am doing a money laundering online course in my company as we speak. Right in the middle of it.

They got a ton of coins stolen and a lot of fiat seized from them. They own a lot less Bitcoin than their customers have (who basically only own numbers on a screen).
They are now either a 'fractional banking' exchange or insolvent. 
Also, asking if something is insolvent when they block all withdrawals and use scapegoats to explain it, is kind of a naive question.
