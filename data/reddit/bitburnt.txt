I just don't get this attitude of people here who want to demonize users who want bitcoin to gain value its insane. You seem to want even more people to sell, putting even more pressure on the price that is already ridiculously to low. That is the complete opposite of what bitcoin needs.

I got into bitcoin 3 years ago this month and much has improved since then and a lot hasn't improved, mostly perceptions. People still thinking its a PonzI/ worried about "another cryptocoin taking over".

Quick, this downtrend has been going on for 15 months.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:22:41
The best way to encourage adoption is by pushing the price up and making people who have heard about bitcoin and don't have any feel like fools for not buying, simple as that. I would really like to use bitcoin to buy stuff but the people who have run the market for the past 15 months have been ripping me/everyone off.

Good HOLD and keep them off exchange.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:02:57
Dam now its back down close to the other exchanges was hoping the other exchanges would move up to where btce was.

1000 MINIMUM don't understand why so many people find a 3.7 billion cap acceptable it's pathetic really.

3 major problems that I see are large financiers, business dragging their feet. Large whales dumping destroying market confidence and users who don't think what they have is golden.

Kinda makes you realize how ridiculously undervalued bitcoin currently is I wonder when if ever bitcoiners will demand higher values for their coins.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:30:14
So they're offering it in the us only why not everywhere?
@_date: 2015-03-09 07:01:47
Generalizing people who use a currency/commodity doesn't make since. "All those people who use gold and euros are all the same" it makes you come across as someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:00:53
As of right now some bitcoiners except peanuts for their coins making all bitcoiners and the market in general look like a joke. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 18:01:02
For some reason people never mention localbitcoins when they're complaining that there's "no where to buy them" not sure why.
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:06:12
This is true for news in general clickbait.
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:01:54
"How can we teach people about bitcoin when they can't even fit inside the building"
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:12:08
Greed is a great motivator this market just needs a pump to get people involved fomo. The important part is not to dump on them pump an hold repeat.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:15:53
Exactly. I don't think the people on here get just how bad this market is doing, trade volume of exchanges miniscule check pathetic price double check. Edit: I see what your all saying about trade volume especially considering how it was a few months ago.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:45:16
What's your question?
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:15:59
I wish companys would just use bitcoin instead of trying to make their own coins this is why the market cap is so low.
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:44:50
I see statements like "I don't want to make early people rich" from regular people all the time I can't help but cringe concidering they do business with people/companys that are scum. My main complaint with the large holders is they do nothing to get the price up like statements from them saying that the price is unacceptable NOPE or that they will refuse to do business below 1000 MINIMUM!
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:18:22
I feel your pain I've tried convincing a friend to buy some coins his excuse "they might get hacked" when I just watched him spend money at the casino an go out to restaurants/bars often. I am convinced that the only way to get people like this involved is for the price to go up alot make them feel stupid for not buying.
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:23:46
Because they want to start some company alt coin instead of just using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:46:14
I ask WTF is wrong with the people that they're willing to do business at these prices, it just seems completely illogical to me. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:38:43
Alot of people have a strange dislike for bitcoin, they claim its the "community" but that's an over generalization like hating people who use gold silver and lumping them together.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:32:52
If we could only eliminate the boom and bust cycle well the bust part at least.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:20:49
The reason they don't hold is volatility to the downside if we were in a uptrend more merchants would hold
@_date: 2015-03-08 02:44:42
Nope general sentiment is in the toilet people don't want bitcoin to be worth anything worthwhile in the thousands including bitcoiners.  Not sure why all the down votes people hate the truth. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:02:41
So due to the stupidity of the common man bitcoin deserves a pathetic market cap?
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:07:37
I think that they don't like that there's no way to estimate the amount of btc users so they chose to ignore it.
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:13:33
Not necessarily many people have this ridiculously negative feelings about it and don't feel like changing
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:00:45
Just whales being whales, this will probably be the extent of this "rally" then a dump and more sideways action.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:21:01
I've wondered the same thing I think having to login is bs
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:25:18
It's unfortunate that Wallstreet will throw billions at those companies but won't do the same for bitcoin.
