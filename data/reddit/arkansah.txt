Fairly well written for an eighth grader.

Yeah I quit reading because it's so much info.  If the bitcoin is never converted back to dollars, I don't see how the IRS could tax it.

I personally think there is a lot more to this than just Apple.  Bitcoin has basically threatened the establishment.  If it continues to spread in popularity and actually becomes a method to facilitate trade than it's current speculative/novelty state, then central banks become obsolete.  You will see more and more of this.  Regulators are already going after early adopters.  Stay the course and keep innovating.  Regulation is always a step behind.  On that note.  How can I get started with bitcoin, I'm ready to buy.

So what do you guys think.  There had been some ideas bouncing around that bitcoin was really a creation of the US government/CIA.  This article seems to strenghthen those lines of thought in my opinion.

The Federal Reserve is doing it's best kill bitcoin before it grows.

The same Harvard that has a 30 billion dollar endowment, and MIT with another 10 billion can't throw a measly 60k your way?

Why did major bankers discredit the idea of a national bank before secretly meeting in Jekyll Island GA to write the law for the Federal Reserve

Naturally.  of course the damage in the sheeple populous is done as they only hear and never investigate.  Plus it never made sense.  if they had a bitcoin account why would they ever rent a car.  Which still doesn't make sense, why even rent a car?
