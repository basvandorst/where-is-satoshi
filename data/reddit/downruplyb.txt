Yes people are buying. They probably think the price is going to go up soon enough and are thinking this current price is cheap!
Meanwhile, The people selling might have bought at 15K+ so might be thinking fuck this is crashing, let me at least sell what I can before the price goes EVEN lower...
MAke sense?
Everyone has a different baseline and reason for buying/selling.

I sued them to buy my first BTC in September, thankfully I nad no issues but I've been very wary about them and will be in the future.
IF you buy with GBP, I can say coinfloor have been great. I've sent them GBP at around 10pm on more than one occasion and my account was credited less than 12 hours later.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:10:36
Yes definitely.
I bought my first BTC back in September and I used CEX, thankfully I had no issues. But I'll be very wary of them in the future... I've been using Coinfloor to buy with GBP and GDAX to trade.
