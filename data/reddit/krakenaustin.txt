Kraken takes pride in moving funds as quickly as possible. Funding delays are rare and decreasingly common.
Op and anyone else, please dm me and I'll take a look at your issue.
Also, Kraken does not go "above and beyond" the call of duty when it comes to KYC/AML requirements. Most requirements are mandated by our payment partners and ultimately governments.

Hello Dueperdue,
I'd love to help you trade on kraken. 
In order to "buy when price is in a range" you must set a limit order. You will see an option to toggle between limit and market. Select Limit and enter your desired price.
Kraken does not currently offer a recurring payment option. This may change shortly as ACH payments come online.

Hello Windfisher,
On behalf of Kraken, I apologize for the difficulties you have encountered. 
The documents requested after your wire was sent were requested by our underlying USD payment provider. This can occur with first time USD deposits, but is not the norm. 
Everyone at Kraken is aware of the inconvenience this causes. We aim to minimize the frequency and impact of these requests, however when dealing with the banking system they are often unavoidable. It is particularly unfortunate that your travel situation added to the inconvenience of this request. Clearly this is beyond our control.       
As the events of today clearly illustrate, obtaining and maintaining banking relationships requires tremendous diligence. Even so, the vast majority of USD transfers made in and out of Kraken each day move without a hitch. In that vein, being forced to refund deposits is an uncommon situation. It would be ideal if kraken were solely responsible for commencing these refund transactions, however these refunds must also be approved by compliance at all levels. This can add to the time required for these refunds to settle. Domestic USD withdrawals initiated from within your Kraken account usually take between 1-3 days for settlement. We are not experiencing any issues with domestic USD withdrawals.
In regards to our support response time, we are committed to returning to our pre-rally response times. In light of recent growth, this has meant aiming to expand our support team as quickly as possible.
As illustrated in a recent post from u/krakenexchange 
     "It's not just a ticket spike from a few months ago. We have been scaling up support for many months but the growth in demand continues to outpace that. Scaling support takes time. To help see the problem consider this: if you have a support staff of 20 and see a sudden 3x growth in demand, now you need a staff of 60 and have to hire and train 40 more people, which takes time. You can make some support processes more efficient, but that will only take you so far. Slow support response is unacceptable no matter the reason, but we mention the rapid growth just to say that we're up against a difficult scaling problem that's not easy to address quickly."
Thank you for bringing up these important issues. I assure you that Kraken is listening to your feedback and acting to resolve all our platform's shortcomings as quickly, and *securely* as possible.

You'll need to be Tier 3 to see these options. Have you been upgraded yet? What is your public account id, I can check on the status.

Hello airman1987,
Apologies for your poor experience.
Please DM me your ticket number and I will do my best to expedite your case.
I cannot speak to the details of your specific case, but sometimes these investigations take longer than anticipated and the reason for the investigation is not always something that would be known to the banks that processed the payment. We're very sorry for the long delay you have experienced and will do everything we can to resolve this as quickly as possible.

Hello ModernMonk,
Please DM me your ticket number or account ID and I can take a look at what might be causing this trouble.
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:05:52
Apologies for the delays and for the problems you've been experiencing.
Please DM me your ticket number and I'll work to resolve your issue.
The past month we have had a huge growth in the number of tickets received due to the growth of our markets. We have since doubled the size of our support staff, however, it takes some time to get the new hires trained. 
We now have support staff across all major time zones. Support response times should return to normal in the coming days.
Austin
