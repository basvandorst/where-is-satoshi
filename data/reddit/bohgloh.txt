That's not something nodes get to decide. BTC is innovative because it created scarcity. What you're suggesting will make it worth exactly $0. Create your own fork, issue a trillion coins and give it to everyone, see how well that goes.

Most people don't understand how/why fiat money works, good luck trying to explain cryptocurrency.
Just say it's a currency where 92% of it is purely in digital form, and is often used to buy drugs and weapons. It goes down in value every year because of inflation and the people in charge of it have said they going to try to bring the value down [even more]( 
Then say, just kidding that's USD.

Yeah but then we'd both be liable adding costs and risks for both of us.  
If the Senate bill criminalizing nondisclosure of cryptoassets goes through (which it will), any time you apply for a loan, a lease, or a job, the forms you submit will include a line item prompting you to disclose any cryptoassets. If you ever get audited, or someone you sold to gets audited, their assets will be revealed along with their address. They can then audit your history on the blockchain. With time it's highly likely more addresses will be revealed and you'd be liable for each transaction.
That is, if the SEC decides to restrict it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:01:49
The first BTC address still exists and it made a transaction (with "obscure exchange").  And how will you exchange XMR to the second BTC address without having another transaction?  So you still have nondisclosure risks. 
If they find your first address, they know you had a specific amount of BTC that you transferred. They'll ask you what you did with it and you shrug your shoulders. They say, okay well you know you had this much at this time so pay us tax on that and on top of that we're adding non-disclose penalties. 
Maybe your id won't ever be exposed and you can silently launder it. But it's like hiding USD, it has its costs and risks.  Just ask any drug dealer or tax haven billionaire.

The interesting thing with crypto is the price will never really effect its ability to be used as digital cash since it can be denominated to ridiculously low units (there's such thing as millisatoshi's)
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:31:02
Like take any month and attempt to analyze why you believe things went a certain way. Take into account any potentially relevant factors and explain your hypothesis. You know, what they do with pretty much every other tradable asset. 
It sometimes feels like there's more legit analysis for markets relating to Pokémon cards than there is for crypto. It's either "the price will never stop growing", it's a bubble/ponzi scheme or it's HODL memes. 
CME's case for BTC was an interesting read, but you don't see that kind of analysis too often.

First off one of the things blockchains doesn't do well is privacy (something crypto developers have readily acknowledged). Pseudonyms are a weak privacy layer (something that ring signatures attempt to address). One known node can identify many and regulators have the tools for prisoner dilemma style information capture. Since the chain is immutable, they can also take their time and retroactively charge you later. They wouldn't even need your code if they can audit your transaction history.

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:46
Yeah there'll always be OTC markets but it'll be thinned out and add enough risk to create a barrier for retail buyers. The blockchain also adds risk for retroactive liability, since the SEC will no doubt create an AML tracker (similar to the FinCEN lists).
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:37:51

Copyright protection has a fraction of the resources that are tied to AML. To put it frankly, local/federal/global agencies aren't as tied up with Taylor Swift getting her cut as they are following money around. They often spend their time figuring out how to tie ppl to the most intractable currency in existence:USD.  An organized, public ledger with unique id's doesn't seem as impractical.

What's the point of owning anything if you don't use it? If you ever buy anything with it or exchange it for govt currency, your address is on the blockchain forever. Maybe 50 yrs from now a person you transacted with is found out and their transactions audited, and they offer him exemptions from tax evasion charges should he provide address id's. Then your fucked and claiming lost seed words won't help you since they can audit the blockchain to see your holdings.

Me. I'm fine with it. Even in retrospect, it wasn't a particularly good investment for the time. First off, there was no real "investment" opportunities since there were no legit exchanges. All you can do was mine it, which was fairly easy to do at the time.
To put it in perspective you can easily just flip it to today and pick a random crypto or startup you know very little about and has no real foreseeable reason to dramatically increase in value. Is it a good investment? Not really. In 2009 you could've taken the less esoteric and risky option by buying tech stocks which have proved to be fairly lucrative (and have a lot less risk).
I do feel bad I didn't mine it, but buy/invest it? Nope.

I guess it's my fault for bringing up macroeconomics on Reddit. 
Investments are subject to inflation (that's why they're included when calculating future/present values). Even if your moon money goes 100x, it's still subject to inflation. Saying you didn't "lose" 2% bcs BTC went higher than the rate of inflation doesn't mean you're "protected" from inflation. You'll always have to reduce your gains by the inflation rate. This will be true until crypto is able to sustain its own functional economy.

Yeah there's about a million different ways govts could control aspects of mining. 
They can infect Bitmain miners, hack pools, or regulate the fuck out of exchanges (even decentralized ones). 
Economically though, it doesn't make much sense for the major economic powers to put much weight against this stuff. So far the market is tiny and fairly insignificant. 
At this point, all it takes is a strongly worded press release from the SEC to fuck up exchanges and restrictions from the electrical companies to fuck up mining.  
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:36:34
You're confusing market value with price levels. Since there's currently no circular flow of income in crypto currencies, you'll always have to factor in fiat inflation rates since it will remain the unit of account until adoption dramatically increases. 
Think of it like stock. I can't buy goods directly with stock so it's valued in fiat. Even if the stock goes up 20% a year from now, I'd still have to factor in inflation for the current value. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:32:47

If you buy a crypto for crypto and the currency you purchased went down in value, how are taxed?
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:59:05
A new fork can do whatever you want it to, including an increase in supply (the only thing that makes it a fork is having backwards compatibility with the original blockchain). 
The analogy is based on the logic of the premise (millionaires can't buy all of a limited thing), which can apply to so many other things that it's a useless observation.
Also the limited Bitcoin theory doesn't take into account the irrelevance of supply when you can denominate one unit to a billionth of a unit (and beyond). So you're right the analogy doesn't apply if you're taking it literally since you can't buy microunits of an N64, but does apply as a limited object who's whole unit cannot be purchased by every millionaire.

@_date: 2018-02-12 22:05:59
The BTC scenario only illustrates scarcity. 
Scarcity by itself is not valuable. If you created your own Pokémon clone with only 10 cards in circulation they would not automatically be worth anything. 
There's reasons why these Pokémon cards have value but you'll have to ask a fan to explain it to you.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:55:25

In relation to what? The price? The supposed market value?
Outside of economic models, we always operate with an unknown future supply.  You cannot assume in 2006 how much USD there will be in 2008 much less 2018 (you'd prob be shitting yourself if you did). BTC supply is actually easier to project than any fiat currency.
If you're wondering how it'll effect the price, the supply alone can't tell you that. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:58:29

I guess losers like Albert Einstein and Henry Ford didn't get the message.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:05:18
It doesn't. Valuations are all still paired to USD. That's why this whole "adoption" thing is necessary.
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:42:50
You people love semantics (BTC has had several forks already--soft &amp; hard forks can change the inventory, only the miners decide consensus etc).  Nintendo needs economic incentives to re-issue the console, just as miners need economic incentives to change the consensus (and they have several times already).
The N64 is a just a placeholder for an object that currently has a fixed supply (so you can feed into the millionaires can't buy all of it scenario). 
Also what?


This is like saying an atom is just a percentage of every atom in the universe. When/if more people use BTC it'll actually have to follow economic principals. As in it doesn't have infinite value because there's a limited supply of it. Regardless of the value of one unit, it'll be denominated to fit the use case and unlike fiat can be denominated to a ridiculously low degree making its inventory irrelevant (as in, you can have only 1 BTC in circulation and have the denominations be low enough that it can be used by every single person on earth, forever).
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:35:56
I don't think you're factoring in the relevant nuances of the market. 
First off, it's highly inefficient and unregulated, making it subject to manipulation and other anomalous behavior (inventory hiccups, fungibility issues etc). Not to mention the often dramatic and sudden changes to government regulations/restrictions.
Also, most cryptos aren't paired with USD (or any other fiat most ppl use for market values) but BTC, so if one crypto goes down, like 95% of all cryptos go down with it (regardless of market sentiment for the alt-coins themselves).
I think attempting a simplified sandbox approach isn't going to yield too much relevant data. This def requires a lot more work to be useful. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:29:31
They also can't buy every N64 still in existence either. Kind of a useless observation.
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:25:45

In theory adoption would increase and the technology would scale with it. As in transaction fees would be lower but there would be dramatically more transactions.  
Yes the general idea behind Bitcoin is there would always be transaction fees of some kind, because without it you don't have an incentive based, decentralized network, you'd just have a cheaper version of what we have now.
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:00:35
Yeah I know what OP is saying, it's just irrelevant and doesn't make any point other than Bitcoin has scarcity which is obvious at this point. 
Yes, scarcity exists, so do economic incentives that change over time. If you believe Bitcoin is independent of influence and runs blindly on a static path, you haven't been paying attention in the past year. And yes miners do decide consensus along with full nodes.

I don't think your pissing people off, you're just not saying anything valuable.


That's true for anything, basic economics would assume it'd move towards equilibrium like anything else.


Under "normal capitalism" companies tend not to be "punished for the advantage they have" (not in the US anyway). Bitmain's advantage is pretty much exclusively due to "normal capitalism". 
Bitcoin's model incentivizes pooling, which is where Bitmain "breaks mining". But this would continue regardless of which pool becomes more popular given the increasing difficulty of finding a block.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:47:03
They're buying a share of the profits generated by miners. They're not buying a product, they're not contracting work. They can freely present their case to the contrary, but this is a legit charge. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:42:54
It's a lot easier to create a BTC fork with more available coins than reissuing an N64.
Plus 33 million produced doesn't mean there's 33 million in existence and available to buy. 
Anyway the N64 is a logical placeholder, you can use any object with a limited inventory to make the millionaire argument (that's the point, it doesn't actually inform anything).
