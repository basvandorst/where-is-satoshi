This uses a lot of words to say something totally irrelevant. Bitcoin isn’t a “security.” And gdax or Gemini aren’t “national securities exchanges.”
Also I *hate* the impulse to go running to regulators in search of government protection, like pretty much every market incumbent in human history. You’re not going to like where that road leads you.

this is a terrible analogy lol
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:02:13
i’ve always thought crypto is bizzarly self-important about something that is still a drop inside a bigger drop in the bucket of the global economy. people have insane/idiotic conspiracy theories and hypotheses as though other people care nearly as much about bitcoin as we do.
but this is straight up twilight zone level self parody. “actual bankers are at work doing grown up things re: grown up assets like stocks, bonds and derivatives. they don’t care enough to protest us so....we’ll make up our own pretend protest!!” this is humiliating. 
also the “why hasn’t the bubble popped” sign seems like it was written by a guy that bought bitcoin in february 2018. on planet earth a 70% price collapse is generally considered a bad thing.
i promise i don’t hate crypto! just like 90% of crypto enthusiasts lol
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:41:33
i agree with you wholeheartedly. you’re going to hurt peoples’ feelings however.
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:19:25
i have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:13:55
This only seems funny until you think about it and realize it's stupid. ATM fees are for the convenience of having access to cash 24/7 without going to a bank. If atms had no fees, there just wouldn't be atms. Or they'd never have cash because why would a bank bother to refill them? 
There's a lot to criticize about banks, but it's also not a coincidence that a huge reason why poor people remain poor is that they're unbanked - every transaction is way more expensive for them than other people. You don't have to be a tin foil lunatic or a moron to like blockchain technology
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:11:21
Sure. If the market equilibrium in the U.K. is that banks must have atms with no fees in order to compete for new customers, that's great. It's also possible that atms cost less to maintain in the U.K. (note all U.K. banks use the LINK network). Or maybe U.K. customers implicitly pay for atms through other fees or borrowing costs. I'd also guess that  atms in the U.K. are more often out of order than in the states. 
My point is that ATM fees don't like offend my sensibilities or anything. If the fees are too high, don't use them. And when you do pay a fee, you're basically saying that having cash in your hand right now is worth more to you than the fee.
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:09:46
I will give a gold star to anyone that can answer this question: who is the victim in this alleged wrong doing?
If you sold your btc to an insider....YOU WERE GOING TO SELL ANYWAY. In fact they probably helped you sell for a better price. 
That’s all leaving aside the fact that “bitcoin cash” isn’t a security and doesn’t have a company with insider information to trade on. What is this shit lmao?

No one bought it at $8,000 - that wasn’t a market clearing price dude. 
BUT even if someone did  buy bitcoin cash for $8,000 when it was selling for $6,000 less on every other exchange on earth, they need to be banned from infecting mankind with future generations of their idiot seed. Let alone have a right to sue. 
How does idiot buyers and temporary market dislocation have anything to do with “insider trading” of non-securities again?

Quick question: how much investing experience do you have? This is sounds more like mental illness than cold-blooded investing. 
I doubt anyone is in the mood for this sort of no-rationale cheerleading when the price behaves like this 
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:35:19
I agree that the reason matters - if yields go up because of an economic apocalypse, maybe the dollar doesn’t appreciate.  but if the fed just sells off all the bonds it bought over the past few years, their yields would spike and this would attract a foreign inflow of capital 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:34:51
I’m here solely for more wonderful greenbacks, Che. The keyboard revolutionaries in crypto are hilarious
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:08:44
Fair enough. The real issue isn’t just the riskiness of certain investments. It’s that retail mom &amp; pop investors are unlikely to understand the risk and reward (based on the level of sophistication I’ve seen on Reddit, this absolutely seems right btw). 
At least you can understand how games in Vegas work and can make informed choices about the risk you’re taking. 
So the SEC says if you want to sell securities, you need to register them (i.e., produce lots of expensive filings that have to be 100% right or you get sued). BUT, if you only sell to people that can hire lawyers and financial advisors, you don’t have to register.
What’s that you say? “All rich people aren’t smart and some non-rich people are plenty smart enough to understand these investments! This isn’t fair.” And I agree! But sometimes it makes sense to use arbitrarily drawn bright line rules instead of subjecting every investor to some exam or something. Besides, Warren Buffet would tell you that private placements and other vehicles only open to accredited investors don’t do better than the market in the long run anyway.
So the real answer is that no one wants your money. The company (Coinbase here) doesn’t want to register and doesn’t want to risk being sued by someone’s know nothing angry grandma. Uber rich VCs don’t want to deal with the average joe that doesn’t know anything but still gets to vote on matters.
Ok /crash course on American securities law
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:44:20
What does this have to do with alleged insider trading of non securities again? Because Coinbase executed the release poorly (I guess?). 
Did Coinbase force anyone to make a trade they didn’t want to? Suing Coinbase because crypto traders behave like *moronic* (I’d love to use a much nastier politically incorrect term here) rabid irrational hyenas is exactly why we can’t have nice things 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:31:12
Well first they’ll have to, you know, understand what the hell it is and stuff 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:32:40
dude what’re you talking about? Bitcoin needs to find a strategy for scaling up and a *generally agreed upon* use case. J.P. Morgan alone moves ~$6 trillion around the globe in a single day. Bitcoin’s daily volume is what, $150 million give or take? 
I promise you no one at 270 Park Avenue is freaking out about Satochi.
I love bitcoin as a disruptor of gold (a $7 trillion market mind you). Full stop (for now). But I’m only here to invest in a promising technology, not join a self-important “revolution” of people that could use a WSJ/FT subscription and a crash course in economics 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:51:53
So this is pretty moronic and makes me embarrassed to be associated with OP as a fellow cryptoinvestor. It ignores the lmao gigantic differences in scale and power between crypto currencies and global financial institutions.
If my checking account is hacked or my debt card is stolen, Bank of America will fix it for me in 15 minutes. You should go ahead and slap the shit out of yourself if you think I’d ever opt for a far, far more time consuming, costly, arcane and volatile method to transfer value that leaves me fucked if anything goes wrong.
I love the potential of bitcoin as an eventual replacement for gold as a store of value. And the idea of decentralized applications capturing significant value sounds awesome. But posts like these make me worry - how smart can my thesis be if idiots agree with me???
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:37:47
it’s hard to take you seriously after the first few sentences. Lunatics generally don’t produce thoughtful, nuanced economic arguments
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:11:17
“Gains not realized aren’t gains.” Re-read this sentence lmao
Having the OPTION to sell for more money today than you did yesterday is a real benefit. All things being equal, I would my btc be worth a million a piece instead of $9,000 - you’re apparently indifferent. It is not inevitable that bitcoin will rise indefinitely or that you won’t have some emergency that will cause you to need to liquidate at an unexpected time.
Based on what I’m reading, early stage crypto investors have 0 chance of surviving the influx of sophisticated investor money on the horizon. So many of you guys are somehow smart and stupid at the same time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:50:47
No you can’t. Basically it is illegal to sell or offer to sell unregistered securities in the United States UNLESS one of a few exceptions apply. 
One exception is Reg D, which says that you don’t have to register a small offering to accredited investors so long as they don’t turn around and sell the securities to the public 
You can’t invest in your friend’s business by buying equity securities unless you meet one of the exceptions. If the SEC finds out they would fuck him pretty bad. Think about all the times friends have screwed each other over going into business together lmao 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:33:35
Well people are generally undisciplined idiots with no impulse control. So long as we have a federal social safety net, it should come with some minor restrictions to keep you from going on it if possible 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:35:15
using bolded words didn’t make your point any better. are you telling me you’re in the exact same economic position regardless of the amount of your paper losses or gains? what if you suddenly need to liquidate? also are you a cult member or an investor? if you’re the latter, you should always accept the fact that those unrealized gains may never ever come back and you lost out by not selling at $1,000,000.
the fact that people will fight you on this point shows just how hardwired certain patterns of irrational thinking truly are. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:01
Weird analogies that only repeat my point back to me but worse =/= good argument
Last time I checked options to buy or sell stock aren’t free. If you don’t believe me, go to the options exchange in Chicago and ask someone for a million Amazon put options for free. I hear they hand them out like fliers when you walk through the door

@_date: 2018-03-11 22:52:49
i agree with the basic point that unwinding all those assets might be the trickiest thing the fed has ever done. i disagree with your economics tho. if the fed screws this up, interest rates will spike and the us dollar will appreciate like crazy. obviously that means it’ll be way harder to export goods and growth will take a hit. 
if your basic point is “this seems impossible for them to pull off so i’m skeptical” tho, that makes a ton of sense to me

I think you’re overestimating how much people care about bitcoin. Economists definitely think it’s stupid for better or worse, but let’s be honest: Bitcoin is still a drop inside a drop in the global economy bucket
People are much more interested in how the fed will unwind QE and whether they’ll boost rates three times this year

1. people have already laid out the good reasons for accredited investor limitations. it’s enormously expensive to go through the full registration process for a public offering - why shouldn’t companies have the flexibility to do offerings with less protections for people with the money and sophistication to take on that risk? it’s easy to wave a pitchfork like a moron but harder to understand complex public policy
2. it is absolutely ADORABLE that you think promising early stage ventures actually want your meaningless pocket change and the enormous headaches that would accompany it.  literally none of the parties involved want your money or input. consider that you’re not even able to wrap your head around Reg A, let alone the waterfall liquidation provisions of a Series A funding agreement lmao
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:12:29
this is stupid in that you’re still losing money. people mentally bucketing money into different silos as though it isn’t fungible is classic retail investor silliness. “house money” is synonymous with idiocy.
if your $10 turns to $1,000,000 and then drops until you sell at $20, you’re seriously going to walk away happy? you lost $999,980 of real money.  
that said, if you invested responsibly, at least losses won’t hurt quite as badly - losing your last $100 hurts more than your 100,000th. but losing sucks
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:43:13
start ups don’t want to pay for an expensive registration process for a full public offering. this gives them a cheap way to raise money without doing a full public offering. 
they don’t want your money either.

Unpopular take for this subreddit: the fed has generally done a good job of executing on its dual mandate (low inflation + full employment).

This is pretty dumb across the board tbh. Price is still down an enormous fuckton YTD. 
And more importantly, I don’t see why banks should freak out when the price goes up without much wider adoption and scaling. If it hit $50k tomorrow they’d just roll their eyes laugh at people buying at that price
