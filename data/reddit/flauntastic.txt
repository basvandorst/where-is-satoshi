Just saw the live stream and it was pretty cool. I know all these jokes are in good fun but are Bitplug and Bitfluid the official names? 
Maybe Bitsocket, Bitoutlet, BitlElectrical, BitAdapter?

I agree, I used to hoard it but figured i'm not doing my part to help it grow. I don't spend it like crazy but use it whenever i buy games

I believe it is essentially a paper wallet without the need to laminate and buy fireproof bags.

Bitcoin will do to Western Union what Skype did to international calling cards.

I've been using Trezor for a while now. Personally i think the investment is well worth the relief of security you get.

Give the paper without an explaination. The smart ones will do the rest.

I've shown the way to one of my friends. "Ok i just sent you 0.1btc" 
"Wow what the?" 
I plan on introducing it slowly to nontech savvy friends but even if its just one person that gets it i think i've helped bitcoin get a little bit stronger.

The amount of effort put into that farm. This is why I believe in bitcoin. Solar-powered mining today, who knows what will come in a few years.

Anyone who doesn't control their private keys is a fool. Coinjar is quite nice for buying/money transfer because of their low fees.

Can't go a week without reading some news on bitcoin or buying more. Ain't a geeky interest no more.

As an Australian i am amused.

I don't define 'moon' as a value. I just picture myself and other believers riding a rollercoaster-shaped rocket ship to the moon with big grins on our faces.

that blockchain technology is *so* hot right now.

As a seller on eBay, fuck the fees.

It's an inside joke by now

The student who asks a question is a fool for a minute. The student who never asks is a fool for life.

It's unspendable because no one has the private keys to that 'random' public address right?
Why 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 and not 
1111111111111111111114oLvT**3**?. 
Also is there a site that checks unspendable addresses all day or?
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:28:52
maybe could help

Stupid question, if Bitcoin were to be used by the masses, what stops billionaires or a group from controlling the price? 
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:32:15
spending bitcoins is.

To my understanding and all the videos i've watched. Mining is computers working together to solve math problems and rewarded coins, but also through mining transactions between two parties are confirmed?  
Is this correct?  
What sort of maths are we looking at?  
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:17:46
What am i looking at? I see  
1) A cat with black eyes  
2) A guy's inverted widows peak + eyebrows  
Or is it something else entirely?
Edit: nvm i got it

And they don't crumple.

Just imagine, a person like me who is half way around the world can send money to this guy with such such little effort and none of that waiting and bullshit. Forgive me, I'm new to bitcoin but that's its potential right? I just can't believe it.
