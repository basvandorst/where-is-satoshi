@_date: 2018-01-14 12:15:03
It's all technical analysis. If it fails to hold 14500 it is trending down, looking for that dreaded bottom.

Doesn't whalecalls long position liquidation scares everyone when logging onto Twitter? Btc usually drops sharply when they liquidate any long position...

I thought the world cup was the perfect time for a BTC spike that guy is eating his own poop now.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:01:16
Spikes are weak coz again lacking volume. It's nice to spike a bit but I think we are stuck for a while.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:29:45
It's a volume induced drop. Without the volume we see another leg down.
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:15:04
Because it is going to fall again without convincing volume
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:03:38
The manipulators are gone. Left with some stagnant pricing stagnant volume. Summer holidays now like resource stocks?

The whole f'ing day has been rekt liquidate sell sell sell sell sell then takes a poop comes back and buy buy buy etc. At the same price almost.

It is forever correcting
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:05:52
The worst thing at the moment is, no one talks about blockchain bitcoin without talking about scams. And when it fell like 50% in a month people are spooked. Already spooked in the summer, fall stagnation where capital slowing drifted away, now it is low ball time or just leave the space in general. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:45:32
