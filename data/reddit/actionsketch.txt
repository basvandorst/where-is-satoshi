The leaked document suggests that they would need to find an enormous amount of money to pay everyone back, and their plan for finding said money is by turning their new gox into a successful business. The redacted page has 4 columns showing growth over the last 3 years and a prediction for the 4th year. If they met that prediction, then they would have made enough money to pay us all back what the theif stole.
While I hope they pull it off, I'm not holding my breath.

so... there's a couple different ways I could interpret your scenario, so I'm going to answer a little more broadly. 
I'm going to use the original satoshi wallet as an example. The satoshi wallet has a place where you can create new addresses for people to send to, so lets say you have 3 of them, each one has 1btc. You now send 2.5 btc to someone else! What the wallet does is makes a transaction where all 3 of your addresses collectively send money to two new addresses. One address is the person you're sending 2.5 btc to, and the other is a new address generated by the wallet behind the scenes. So now, your wallet has 3 addresses you created, each with 0 btc and 1 address behind the scenes that has 0.5 btc. 
The next question you will probably want to ask is, how does the wallet choose which addresses to send from? The answer is, I don't know =p My guess is that it gives priority to the hidden addresses.

You can follow transactions a little bit, but it's a tangled web that includes stolen coins merging with clean coins and no way to tell the difference between a person moving coins between two addresses they own and someone making an actual transaction. Additionally, there is software specifically designed to take coins and scramble them up so that they're difficult to trace.
Bitcoins don't exist like physical coins where you can just track a serial number. They're much more fluid than that, on purpose and for the sake of personal privacy and anonymity.

hmm... not sure I explained it well enough. The customer is the thief. It goes like this...
1) put btc into mtgox
2) withdraw btc from mtgox
3) duplicate transaction, change txid, submit to network and hope that your transaction is the one that gets accepted.
4) if step 3 worked, complain to mtgox that you never got your coins
5) profit

Although I'm sure some where, I don't think a lot of people were choosing to keep their coins in an exchange. Remember that Gox was accepting bitcoin deposits even after they stopped allowing withdrawals. People who didn't know any better were making it worse while people who wanted out were waiting patiently. Things have also been very exciting recently, so people are more inclined to buy and sell on an exchange to hopefully take advantage of the $1200 bubble. The timing was terrible.

I totally agree with you, mine is only my opinion and I'm sure there are people who could prove in some cases otherwise. But, I think it's fine to make this generalization because I think fairly accurate generalizations can be made of the incentives. 
Those writing open source are doing it primarily because they're passionate about what they're doing and they get to be self-directing. They'll spend the extra time to make code they're proud of.
People who are working are, at most companies, incentivized only to make it work. Even if you have someone who is passionate about what they do, the schedules can force you to leave code behind that you would have liked to refactor or otherwise improve.
But again, you're right... it's all generalizations and there are lots of companies that are out there that want their employees to produce quality. There's also a lot of open source projects that are terrible quality, either because the person who started it are also still becoming better programmers themselves or it could also be disregard for code quality in favor of spending less time. And I'm sure there's more examples...
It's like asking... is a UI going to be better if it's public facing or internal? You're probably gonna put a lot more effort into your public facing website than your custom administration panel. I think the same can be said about source code... as soon as the source code itself becomes public facing, presentation matters more. And in the world of shared code, presentation is a large part of quality.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:19:46
Well, I say it's easy because I found it a lot easier to understand than I expected. It's no cryptography paper... Those require deep specialized knowledge. I don't think the bitcoin white paper requires more than a understanding of statistical probability, an idea of how the internet works and an idea of how public key cryptography works. Even if you don't know these things, I don't think they're difficult to learn in an hour or so of googling around.
tldr; it's easy because it doesn't require any heavily specialized knowledge... But it does require some slightly obscure knowledge, so how about "it's not hard"?

the reports seem to suggest that the theft was slow and has been going on for a long time. They were also exploiting MtGox's system, which means that the system itself could have been reporting false information to whoever would be responsible within the company. If the same system responsible for refunding bitcoins also reported how many bitcoins MtGox had in their reserves, their own systems could have been deceiving them.
We know they wrote their own software for managing bitcoin transactions on the blockchain because this is what caused the whole problem in the first place. I don't think it's much of a stretch to suggest that the same system could have had more problems than that.

To everyone in here ripping on people who had coin in gox... shut the fuck up. Gox was the most trusted name in bitcoin for a long time, they didn't have as many coins as they did because they had a bad reputation. They had one of the best reputations in the bitcoin community. Additionally, absolutely no one can claim that they saw this coming. No one expects a company as profitable as MtGox to just one day lose all their money. Do not pretend you're somehow above others because you got lucky. What happened with Gox is not the fault of the people who had money in the exchange. If you don't want to give charity, you don't have to and I respect your decision not to... but don't go telling the victims that they somehow deserved this.

There's a security philosophy that says any system that isn't secure enough to be openly examined isn't secure enough to use. It doesn't promise perfect security. 
Also, I think it's generally true that open source code is better written than closed source. Closed source inspires laziness while open source puts a lot more pressure on programmers to write their best code.

When you sweep a private key, the entire balance is withdrawn so there is no change.


no, you always send the entire amount.


There is none. If you want to only take a portion of the coins from a paper wallet, you have to sweep the entire balance and then send however much you didn't want to take out back into the same paper wallet.
EDIT: Also, just to expand on the concept of "change" in bitcoin... the way the bitcoin protocol works, you can never send a portion of a balance in a transaction... all transactions require that the entire balance is spent. The "change" is the portion of the balance that gets sent into an address you own. In the case of blockchain.info, the change is sent directly back into the same address but most (all?) other wallets will generate a new address to send the change into. This is for anonymity so that someone tracing transactions can't tell the difference between the outputs.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:35:13
ah, gotcha. I was confused because I believe in some of the altcoins, the coins actually can be destroyed and not just lost.

The problem with reusing the same address is that it has the potential to compromise the anonymity of the person who owns the address... but if you don't care about that, such as someone who publicly posts an address, then it doesn't matter. I think the point the FAQ is trying to make is that we should default to not reusing the same address because if everyone just reused the same address, it could make it easier for someone to trace the entire network and compromise the anonymity of those who wish to have it. 
so, just to be sure we're on the same page, a wallet is not the same thing as an address... a wallet is a collection of addresses. So, technically, you can't send money to a wallet, rather you send money to an address within that wallet. However, blockchain.info uses 1 address per wallet and does not create new addresses for each transaction. I imagine they do this because it's more user friendly and people don't get as confused.
So, if you send 1 BTC from 3 different addresses to 1 address, then that 1 address will show 3 btc. There is no way for anyone to determine what addresses belong to what wallets aside from straight detective work connecting endpoints and clues. Unless of course, you only have 1 address per wallet, like blockchain.info does. Then it's much easier and your anonymity is limited.
I wish blockchain didn't use one address per wallet, but they do for better or worse. I use them anyway, because they're hands down the most trustworthy web wallet around... but, I would like to see a wallet that creates new addresses when sending coins and manages to encourage the creation of a new address for each transaction while maintaining user-friendlyness.
edit: Another point I'll add about the anonymity... in the bitcoin protocol, you always send the entire amount of an address. So, if you have 5 btc at an address and you send 1 btc to another address... that transaction is actually sending all 5 btc and splitting it into two addresses, one you own and one you don't. Blockchain.info uses the same address that is being sent from to send back into while (all?) other wallets always create a brand new address to store the rest of the transaction in. This obfuscates the transactions on the network a great deal better because someone looking from the outside wouldn't know which address has the coins that you own and which address has the coins you sent.... they just know there's a transaction of 4btc in one direction and 1btc in the other. If that 4btc is sent back to the same address, then they can better follow the trail of a transaction.
This is why the distinction between a wallet and an address is important... a wallet needs to keep track of all the additional addresses that get generated when making new transactions.... unless you're using blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:08:39


by moving the bitcoins between addresses in a mixer to clean them and then sell the coins in an exchange.


You own your own bitcoin address, similar to a checking account number. You can see all transactions in and out of this address and you can prove your ownership over an address. So, if you give me an address to send bitcoins to, both of us can see on the public record that the transaction was made.


bitcoins are not stored like that... bitcoins are more or less infinitely divisible. The unique identifier is your public key, which you can think of as similar to a checking account number. Your account is made up of nothing more than a series of transactions, +5 btc, -2 btc, etc etc...
So, you can trace all bitcoins to their creation, but a "single bitcoin", or 1 btc, could be made up of lots of different transactions over time that came from many different places.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:08:26
So there's different kinds of cold storage, and I'm not going to pretend I know about all of them so assume I'm only talking about Paper Wallets:
you can't send money from a paper wallet. Paper wallets allow you to send money into them and sweep the balance. Think of it like a piggy bank, you can put money in slowly over time, but when you want to take the money out, you have to break it open and pull all of it at once.

Here you go... the new gox facebook page says that a statement will be issued today: 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:03:51
It doesn't work like that. The trick was that MtGox trusted the txids when they shouldn't have because they can be changed due to malleability. This mean that the transaction worked, the bitcoins were sent and the person who requested them received them... but the transaction record that gox had didn't match the blockchain because the thief managed to get the blockchain to accept an alternative txid for the transaction. This is where the scam happens, the theif makes a support request saying that they never received their coins and when MtGox looks for the txid of the transaction on the blockchain, it's not there (not because the transaction didn't take place, but because the txid was intercepted). So, then MtGox sends another transaction to the person and now the thief has doubled their withdrawal. 
The way I see it, the most likely thing that could have happened if the huge loss was due to malleability is that the system made the assumption that the refunded coins were NOT spent twice and didn't include logic to confirm this. It seems likely to me especially because we know they rolled their own software for making bitcoin transactions, they were probably using the same software to watch their reserves.
But, the coins were not destroyed... to my knowledge, it's impossible to destroy coins.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:37:13
No one knows if the theft was due to malleability or not. If it was malleability, that means the thief had an account... and I'm pretty sure they have quality ID records for anyone who had an account. If it wasn't malleability, then the possibilities are endless.
However, there is no way to prevent the bitcoins from being spent. The system is anonymous enough that the bitcoins can't be traced with enough certainty to allow anyone to do what you're suggesting.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:24:23
Technically possible but very unlikely. It's more likely that this is a company who has grown 100x in the last year and become a target faster than they could build walls. Bitcoin, while fundamentally secure, is still susceptible to plenty of attack vectors that require highly-competent companies to handle.

It's 0.65 billion billion years to break a single private key with current technology. However, using moore's law to project technology advances over time, it would take 60 years.

@_date: 2014-02-28 17:40:33
Bitcoin was literally written by the best and most cutting edge cryptography programmers alive and I guarantee you that bitcoin has been tested rigorously. That said, it doesn't mean the protocol is perfect. The bitcoin wiki has a list of weaknesses, including the malleability problem that gox is blaming, which has been known for a while and is not a "surprise". But, if you're not aware already, literally everything in the electronic world has a list of weaknesses attached to it. This is the wild west of the internet, we are the pioneers and hackers are the cowboys.
Investing in bitcoin isn't like investing in gold, Bitcoin is investing in the future of cutting edge technology and human achievement. You invest not because it's safe, you invest because you believe it has potential.

The way I figure it, either their cold storage wasn't actually very cold... in that there was a way to electronically or automatically pull funds out of it. OR, someone simply locked themselves out of the cold storage leaving no one to be able to access it. And then there's also always the possibility that someone with privileged access stole it.

IOUs would be issued by trusted people. Imagine MtGox or blockchain.info issuing a BTC IOU. You trust them, and it's likely anyone who would accept bitcoin would also accept a blockchain IOU.

Unless something happens that destroys peoples trust in the system, I think bitcoin will remain the gold of the cryptocurrency world for a long time.
I have wondered though, seeing as how bitcoin brings it's own ideology with it, if someone won't come up with a cryptocoin that represents an alternative ideology. Like a coin with a system of wealth distribution built into it, or a coin that has controlled inflation. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-05-21 09:39:33
well... that breaks the security structure. In order to stop someone from seeing your transaction and taking it for themselves, you would need to encrypt the entire communication... which is basically a p2p messaging system. 
Then, if you sent the IOU to bob and bob decided to exchange it with alice, there's no way for alice to know if bob didn't just double spend his IOU.
the central ledger is the whole reason scarcity can exist in a p2p system. Without it, you can just print IOUs all day long and no one can verify if they're worth anything.

Wouldn't that require all the miners manually switching back as well? The thing that I'm concerned is if an attacker compromised BTC Guild and use it's hashrate for it's own purposes. If everyone in the guild was using GetBlockTemplate, an attacker wouldn't be able to use the hashrate.
Over the long term, I expect as soon as ASIC miners get common enough and other pools improve their usability that this whole thing isn't an issue. 
But until then, BTC Guild is a point of failure. Even with 35% of the hashrate, an attacker would have a 25% chance of forcing a longer blockchain. At 45% of the hashrate, that chance increases to 76%.
Again, I don't have anything against anyone who chooses to be a part of BTC Guild and I have faith in the people who run it. I just don't have any reason to trust their security from someone on the outside taking advantage of their position right now.

@_date: 2013-05-21 08:29:12
Ah, allow me to try and change your mind =)
One of the largest complaints about bitcoin is how long it takes for a transaction to confirm. Ripple solves this by allowing you to exchange bitcoin with a trusted gateway for a IOU. Unlike bitcoin transactions that take 10-60 minutes, an IOU transaction takes less than 20 seconds.
Another reason ripple is cool is that it decentralizes the exchanges. So, say I have a bunch of MtGox IOUs and you want to buy some bitcoin but their website is being DDOSed. No problem, I'll trade you some of my IOUs at the current price and you can cash them in once MtGox recovers.
One last thing, ripple allows you to trade between any currency in the world without going through banks. Doesn't mean much for bitcoin, but it means a lot for the world.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:50:10
There's no guarantee that green addresses won't be compromised, they represent a false sense of security. If anything, it's the mining pools who will be targeted and compromised as most of them still use a centralized security model.
Now, if there was a way to see if over half of the network's CPU power has accepted your transaction before the confirmations can confirm it in the blockchain, that would allow you to reduce risk without confirmations. But, this does not exist. Maybe one day it will.
@_date: 2013-05-21 09:45:21
I can't tell if you're talking about the technical implementation of the ripple network or the ease with which humans can be tricked into being scammed out of their money...?
With the former, I don't have much to say except that I've read enough people who I trust(hah) that say the tech seems to be solid.
with the latter, you could say the same exact thing about bitcoin. Ultimately, it becomes a business opportunity to protect people.
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:41:13
Look at this transaction for example: 
you see a single input and two outputs. This is a standard bitcoin transaction. When sending coins with bitcoin-qt, the software creates a new address to store the change in. I understand that other wallets will actually use the same address as the input for one of the outputs, and while this helps people's mental model of how bitcoin should work, it hinders the anonymity of the system.
in the example transaction, you can't tell which output is the one the sender owns... or if the sender owns both, or neither! This is why the rule exists that the entire balance is always sent in a transaction...
also, here's a little factoid, it's the remainder from the input minus the outputs that equals the transaction fee for the miner.

The popular opinion is that the DDOS is someone who is attempting to drive down the price of bitcoin so that they can buy low, sell high and repeat.
However, given the bitfloor DDOS effectively forcing people to not sell until after the price started rising again, you could argue that the bitfloor DDOS was a someone forcing the bitfloor exchange to freeze until the price stabilized, much like Mt.Gox is doing voluntarily.
However, this is all speculation, and it's unlikely that it will ever be anything more than speculation.

Depends how you measure importance. Do you measure it by what will allow the internet to survive and thrive? Or do you measure it by the how much it benefits society? Or do you measure it by how impressive the financial figures are to economic growth?
Personally, I believe that the benefit to society trumps everything else. If something is truly beneficial to society, survival and growth will follow.
so, what are society's greatest needs?
- Sustainable resources
- Greater equality
- Safety for good people (there's got to be a better way to phrase that...)
Now, I would argue that the internet has moved us towards solving these needs faster than anything the world has ever seen. I would also argue that, the key to the internet's success is the freedom of communication.
What I see all over the world right now is amazing advances in how internet communication is utilized, and powerful people who are afraid of what that means to their familiar and comfortable life.
So, my answer is, the freedom of the internet is the single most important thing on the internet, and there's two groups of technology maintaining that freedom... defensive and offensive technology.
Bitcoin has a lot of potential as an offensive technology to eat away at very powerful people. It has yet to prove it self in doing so, but I think we all see a massive potential. Until it does, it's not the most important. The most important offense right now would have to be torrents and tor, as they have already been proven.
But, you can't forget the defensive technology that is keeping the internet free for things like bitcoin to exist. Wikipedia, kickstarter, Reddit, Facebook, forums, etc all wouldn't exist without internet freedom, which limits the ways that the internet can be controlled.
The only answer left for those who don't want to lose their comfortable and familiar lifestyle is to control the internet through brute force invasion of privacy. And so, here we sit.
EDIT: I shouldn't generalize people who disagree as being selfishly attached to a comfortable and familiar lifestyle, they also include people who have a different definition of importance than I do.

It's large because it contains a record of every single bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place.
I don't know what the current status is on making it smaller... but there have been some ideas shuffled around on how to reduce the size of it. I think there's even a bounty for someone who can figure out a good solution.
that said, the bitcoin android client does not download the entire blockchain... I'm guessing that it just downloads a shallow copy, like the last 200 blocks or something. This isn't a perfect solution though...
it's important that miners have the entire blockchain (although not all of them do right now, due to centralized mining pools... but this is expected to change by the end of the year) so that they can't be tricked with counterfeit coins.
It's also important, although less so, for clients to have the entire blockchain so that they can't be tricked by malicious peers.
A solution that will reduce the size of the blockchain will need to allow the same level of security that the current blockchain provides... until then, it's only going to keep growing and getting larger.

It's not recommended that you have multiple wallets with the same addresses. Just generate a new address and transfer your BTC to it.

hmm... well I might be the wrong person to answer this because I'm biased against the idea of paper wallets, but let me try.
First, I'll explain my bias. All physical bitcoin private keys must be generated digitally first, therefore using one requires trust in both the person and the machine that created it.
As for why it hasn't been done before... it probably has? I could see someone taking a printed private key QR code or a flashdrive with the code on it and storing it in a safe while keeping the public key handy for sending funds into the safe. This would actually be safer than the other physical wallets that people have been talking about simply because you don't have to trust a 3rd party to delete the digital copy of your private key.
I hope that answers your question =)

there's a lot of misinformation and uninformed perspectives on ripple right now.
Ripple is a peer to peer currency exchange IOU system. It's bitcoin inspired, but is actually very different and extremely complimentary. Infact, once the service is officially launched, it will allow people to trade BTC near instantly without involving adding new transactions into the bitcoin blockchain. 
For instance, say you had a ripple wallet and Mt.Gox setup a ripple gateway. You could then exchange the bitcoins, usd, or whatever you have for a Mt.Gox branded IOU. You could then spend the IOU, just like you would spend a bitcoin, with anyone who accepted Mt.Gox bitcoin/usd/etc IOUs. The transaction would be confirmed in 2-20 seconds, and the merchant could redeem the IOU from MtGox for the amount you sent, or they could spend it somewhere else!
The core of the misinformation around ripple has to do with people who think it "has it's own money" and that it "isn't decentralized". They have no desire to pull people away from bitcoin, infact I understand them to largely be bitcoin supporters.
Like BTC, ripple has a cryptocurrency called XRP... XRP exist for 2 reasons: 1) for use as a transaction fee to protect the system against denial of service attacks. 2) a way for OpenCoin, the for-profit developer, to monitize the network once it's become stable. You don't mine XRP, instead the vast majority of them are centrally owned and distributed by OpenCoin. OpenCoin will distribute a large majority XRP for free until the network gains enough momentum, and then will likely sell their remaining XRP. But, as all things in any market, they will be subject to the laws of supply/demand and competition by people who received some of the free XRP.
It's actually a pretty genius way to create a decentralized peer to peer network that benefits the world while still being able to pull a profit for your work.
Ripple is not a scam, and recently Google Ventures has invested a large amount of money into it. The problem is that, to bitcoiners, it looks sorta like bitcoin... but it is infact not bitcoin whatsoever.

There are people on bitcoin talk reporting being paid upwards of $500 to post negative ripple comments and there are anti-ripple ads being pushed on bitcoin talk.
Since I've become a bitcoiner, this community has become an important part of my life and I want to do my part to make sure it's a healthy community. The negativity I see around ripple is not objective discussion, it's adversarial fear mongering. I don't like it, and I don't want it to become a part of this community.

If it's in the blockchain sending to the same address as the on in your wallet, you have little to worry about.
There are a couple reasons you might not see the transaction show up in your wallet immediately...
- Wallets that have a purpose other than storage, like the MtGox wallet, require that there be a minimum of 6 confirmations on a transaction before reflecting the funds in your wallet
- If you're using a wallet that runs as a "full node", such as the Bitcoin-qt wallet, you will need to wait for the entire blockchain to finish downloading to see your funds show up in your wallet.

I feel like all these concerns are addressed in the wiki... but, if I'm wrong, please keep replying
All responses below are from wiki:


getblocktemplate is the new decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol, openly developed by the Bitcoin community over mid 2012. It supercedes the old getwork mining protocol, and is ***expected to replace it entirely within 2013.***


 ASICs
The original getwork protocol only provides a single block header, which is sufficient for a total of about 4 GH of mining. With the "rollntime" extension, this can be extended to 4 GH *per second*, but even that is far from sufficient for the next generation of mining equipment (ASICs) which are capable of 1000 GH/s on the high end.
***By moving block creation to the miners, they are enabled to create as much work as they need locally, thus overcoming this limitation.***
Due to scalability problems, bitcoind's JSON-RPC stack has not been able to keep up with the hashrates needed for solo mining today. ***Since getblocktemplate drastically reduces the load required to a single request per new block on the network, direct solo mining on bitcoind is again possible.*** Poolservers likewise benefit from having to meet much lower demands of miners who can make their own blocks. 


 Extensible
The original getwork protocol was designed in a way that was very incompatible with extensions. As a result, as new functionality was needed, extensions were "hacked in" out-of-band using HTTP headers. ***getblocktemplate is designed from the start to be flexible for future extensions***, and the BIP 23 specification already covers how the established getwork extensions can be implemented cleanly, regardless of transport protocol.

Not all links are created equal. If a link is posted on a forum by a user, the website is not responsible. This reasoning is extended to websites like google and Reddit.
the wallet list in bitcoin.org is static content not generated by a user or by crawling websites.

OpenCoin is a for-profit company. They want to make money from what they're creating, and I see no problem with that... infact, it's actually a quite genius solution for how one could go about creating a p2p network and not have to go poor!


The central ledger is the equivalent of the blockchain in bitcoin. It's necessary for the network to be decentralized. Bitcoin is susceptible to spam too.


I'm not following you on this one... care to explain?


Same is true for bitcoin. I think the general feeling is that, if the government is disabling your internet... you've got bigger things to worry about.


It is fully p2p and decentralized. If OpenCoin was blown off the face of the earth, ripple would be capable of carrying on. 


I think of it as a debt system with a centralized cryptocommodity built on top of it as a way to prevent denial of service attacks and as a way for OpenCoin to monitize the network... which again, I have no problem with.

Ripple and bitcoin are two separate beasts. Ripple is a decentralized exchange, bitcoin is digital gold.
If you're refering to XRP compared to bitcoin, XRP is a way to prevent denial of service attacks on the network and a way for OpenCoin to monitize the network.
If there's anything the OpenCoin has done wrong, it's suggesting that XRP could be a currency... it's not, it's a commodity. It's the envelope you put your check in and throw away when it's reached it's destination.

I have my own issues with green addresses. There's no reason that you couldn't just ask for the address owner(like MtGox) to sign a receipt using the private key.
But that's beside the point, and your question is a good one! You're right, there are other ways to quickly confirm a bitcoin transaction using a trusted address holder. It's not formalized, but that shouldn't matter.
Ripple does 2 things that don't necessarily have to do with bitcoin, and it's these two things that are central to the intent behind ripple:
1) Decentralized Currency Exchange - it's a formalized channel of exchanging currency that circumvents the banks. For most people, this means that you can turn your USD into YEN without having to ask permission. And for bitcoiners, this means it's possible to buy bitcoin from MtGox even if their website is experiencing a DDOS.
2) Debt - you can issue IOUs to anyone and keep a formal record of your debt. The person who you issued the IOU to can then trade it with someone else who also trusts you, and eventually cash it out. This one is less impressive, but there's potential.

Bitcoin is so much more than just an alternative currency for many people. If everyone was getting into Bitcoin because it was a way to get rich quick, like dot-com, it would be a devastating bubble pop. But unlike most bubbles, Bitcoin has a significant investor base who is investing for ideological reasons... and that's a very powerful thing. I'm not saying that the bubble won't pop, but when it does there will still be an army of people who keep buying it purely because they -believe- in it as an alternative to what we have now.
I think a lot of people misinterpret these celebrations of $10 or $1bil milestones as people with dollar signs in their eyes... and while those people exist, I think most of us are still viewing it as social proof that other people believe in the same thing we do.
as for 200 being ludicrous, I don't think we're in popping territory yet... I think it will hit 1k before it pops. But then, I'm optimistic =)

you can trust bitaddress.org, I just played with it while watching network traffic and it seems legit. If you are concerned about a scenario where bitaddress.org was compromised, then safe browsing mode while disconnected from the internet makes sense as a precaution.
That said, the biggest problem that I've seen affecting bitcoin users recently is malware-related. This means that it's not the website you have to be worried about, it's your own computer. This is why 2-factor authentication has been growing in popularity, it requires the use of a 2nd machine in order to gain access.
Also, phishing-related problems, which means you clicked something that you shouldn't have.
So, my advice to you is this... 
- get protection: antivirus software like AVG or Avast and probably also  malwarebytes or spybot search and destroy
- anytime your tempted to click a link to a website that you have an account on, instead type the website address in the browser yourself or use your own bookmark.
- disable java applets on your browser
- don't use Internet Explorer

Every transaction from bitcoin qt creates a new address for the change... Which means, it's probably a good idea to back it up after every transaction if you have a lot of coins in there.
What I would do is use it like a savings account, store the majority of your coin in there and have a second wallet that you use for all your actual transactions. This way, you only send money from your savings wallet once in a while, and you usually just send money into your other wallet. I think of it as the difference between my checking and savings account.

I think ERTE3424 is saying that it matters which transaction a miner receives first, not just how big the fee is. A transaction with a higher fee than a different transaction will get priority, but a new transaction that conflicts with an existing transaction will be ignored regardless of fee size. So, you would need to have control over which miners received which transaction, not just control over the fees.

Hm, well I've read up on the forum posts for green addresses... and you're right in that it does add additional security to a transaction, but I personally don't think it's enough for a 0/conf. Especially since the green address then becomes a single point of failure. 
I don't understand why anyone implementing this, like Mt.Gox, wouldn't just allow new transactions to be validated by asking for a signature... just like the Bitcoin-qt wallet has always allowed for. Additionally, any list of green addresses would need to be maintained by the company who you trust... so you would need to communicate with them anyway, might as well just sign a unique address rather than willingly broadcast a public address. That way, as the owner of a trusted address, you control your liability and reduce the chances of your trusted address being compromised. Plus, green addresses require 2 transactions instead of one, thereby adding unnecessary transactions into the blockchain... which isn't a big deal for individuals, but should be considered when it's a company making tons of transactions a day.
And, I think it's worth mentioning that the originators of the idea was instawallet... who's since been hacked into non-existence.
All that said, I could be wrong about green addresses. But, personally, I wouldn't use them.
Oh, and to your point about small versus large transactions... I can't find any evidence of anyone else sharing that opinion. In fact, in the MtGox thread, someone actually says that these are intended for large transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:38:08
each proof of work includes a hash of the last block in the chain... therefore, as a chain gets longer, the block with your transaction becomes buried and the likely hood that your transaction will be permanent increases.
Also, I feel I should mention, a wallet is nothing more than a collection of private keys and addresses. And as far as the blockchain is concerned, an address is nothing more than the output or input of a transaction. 
So, TECHNICALLY, your bitcoins are sitting in a block somewhere on the chain as part of a transaction. Your wallet full of private keys only gives you the authority to append new transactions to the ones that already exist in the blockchain.

The only way you could default is if you open your own gateway allowing you to issue IOUs, like a bank. People who trust you would give you their hard currency for an IOU that you issue. If you default, then those people will no longer trust you and it will be unlikely that you can get anyone to accept IOUs from you.
However, the real answer is that it's unlikely that you will ever put your self in that position. The people who are likely to issue IOUs are the businesses large enough to have name recognition and a lot to lose from defaulting, like MtGox, blockchain.info, paypal, etc.

If you read the [original whitepaper]( Satoshi actually does the math... which I will reiterate in my own words... 
If an attacker gets control of 10% of the network... for z confirmations, there is a probability of P that the attacker finds the next block first.
z=0 P=1.0000000
z=1 P=0.2045873
z=2 P=0.0509779
z=3 P=0.0131722
z=4 P=0.0034552
z=5 P=0.0009137
z=6 P=0.0002428
z=7 P=0.0000647
z=8 P=0.0000173
z=9 P=0.0000046
z=10 P=0.0000012
So, you can see at 6 confirmations, there's a 0.02% chance that the attacker will be able to reverse a transaction. But at 1 confirmation, there's a 20% chance that an attacker will be able to reverse a transaction. So as a merchant accepting bitcoin, you have to look at this and ask your self, how much risk exactly am I willing to take for my sale?

It's difficult if not impossible to actually measure the energy consumption of these different digital means because of how complex the definition of energy can be. I don't know enough to give you a real clear comparison, but I've thought about it enough to at least share my perspective.
Online services that facilitate financial transactions require the employment of a large workforce. This workforce consumes energy as does the computers they use and the buildings they work in. These services also use a client-server model of networking instead of peer-to-peer, which means that we need to figure in the massive energy cost of running those servers!
Bitcoin facilitates similar if not the same transactions with a completely computerized workforce(miners). The computerized workforce consumes a lot of electricity, something comparable to what a server would consume. There are still people required to manage their contribution to the workforce, but nowhere as many. Also, because of the peer architecture and the governing protocol, a huge amount of legal responsibility is lifted off those who run bitcoin, which means less necessary energy spent on legal issues.
And there's probably more ways that bitcoin reduces the energy required to make a financial transaction. So to answer your question, I would say yes. Bitcoin has taken this extremely large energy consuming financial system and turned it into a small simple package of energy consumption.
Some people see miners running their millions of wasted hashes as a egregious waste of energy, but in reality it's a small price to pay in replacing a much much larger and complex system of wasted energy.

I don't know a lot about the subject, but what I gather is that the negative attitude towards the other cryptocurrencies is because they only offer slight modifications of the original bitcoin source code... and a lot of times, those changes solve a problem only to create new ones.
Litecoin for instance, has faster confirmation times but is no more secure than bitcoin... making the faster confirmation worth less. Litecoin also uses a hashing algorithm that is supposed to keep ASICs from being possible keeping the bar for entry into mining lower, however this also means that you can mine litecoins with a botnet while bitcoins are too difficult to mine with a normal computer so botnets are useless for mining.
The ripple arguments seem to be surrounding the centralization of their service and the product they've delivered versus the product they set out originally to make.

XRP isn't a hard asset, it's value is controlled by OpenCoin. Furthermore, with only 1 XRP, you could make 100,000 IOU transactions. You don't need a ton of XRP to use Ripple, nor is that the intention of Ripple.
an IOU represents real currency and is backed by the issuer. If you don't trust the issuer, then don't accept the IOU. It's that simple.

I think it's safe to say that this will be eventually solved, it will just take a while. There are solutions that have been discussed and only need to be implemented, unfortunately development is slow because the work is highly skilled.
Maybe a good solution would be to surface this problem as a kickstarter-style bounty on the bitcoin.org website?

I heard when Reddit started accepting them, I assumed it was some kind of centralized internet currency. Ignored.
later, after my mom accused my generation of not knowing anything about privacy, I started researching things like Wikileaks, tor, vpn, cyphernomicon and of course bitcoin.
That was when it was at $32. It took me until it hit 75 to invest... And I feel my interest in the potential of technology to combat censorship and bring the world together has only just started.

1) bitcoins are mined as a number of transactions are grouped together to form a block. The first transaction in any block is generated bitcoin, and whichever miner manages to finish their block first and have that block be the one that gets built on top of gets those bitcoins.
The complex problem is a math problem that can be made either easier or more difficult based on what you ask of it. The difficultly of the problem is policed by the network such that it should, on average, take 10 minutes to solve. Unfortunately, I don't know much more about it than this.
2) Yes, search cryptocurrencies. There are lots of them, but they're mostly if not all slight modifications of bitcoin. It's expected that litecoin will be traded on Mt.Gox within the next month or so.
3) I believe the answer is "Austrian Economics", although I don't claim to have researched the subject yet.
4) Scarcity and the promise of economic freedom because of it's anonymity and decentralization.

From the getblocktemplate wiki:
The original getwork mining protocol simply issues block headers for a miner to solve. The miner is kept in the dark as to what is actually in this block, and has no influence over it. In effect, the authority of the miner to decide which transactions are accepted, etc, is all transferred blindly to the pool operator. A corrupt (or compromised) pool operator could use the combined hash power of all the miners to execute double spend attacks or other similar attacks.
getblocktemplate moves block creation to the miner, while giving pools a way to set down the rules for participation. While pools can do just as much as they could before by expressing it in these rules, miners can not be kept in the dark and are enabled to freely choose what they participate in mining. This improves the security of the Bitcoin network by making blocks decentralized again.

I'm not being deliberately obtuse, I really am having trouble understanding the point you're making.
If I were to compare this project with bitcoin, I would say they both:
- reflect a growing movement of people trying to figure out how to better organize society 
- are purposefully trying to exist outside government regulation
- appeal to libertarians
as for the floating island being the polar opposite of bitcoin's strength through dispersion, doesn't a floating island contribute to the networks strength by creating a haven from existing social structures? The more places that bitcoin can disperse to, the better it is for everyone using it... regardless of it's landmass.

This is the best guide I've read to answer your question: 
But, I want to just highlight the last paragraph of the windows/mac explanations:


What they're saying is that if you get the dev sig from the same place that you got the program... it's just as likely that an attacker would be able to compromise the sig as they would the program download. 
And while the in-person key exchange is the best method, it's not generally feasible. A compromise might be that you use two different channels to acquire the program and the dev sig, that way any MITM attack would be forced to intercept both channels instead of just one. For instance, download the dev sig on your phone using a mobile network connection while downloading the program using a PC and a wifi connection. This method would be similar to the security gained by using 2-factor authentication, which protects you as a target being compromised but does not protect you from the website it self being compromised... which is why the in-person exchange is still the best way.
I feel I've rattled on too long... hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:32:31
It's not about the owners of the pool. If a pool as big as BTC gets compromised, someone with malicious intent could potentially manipulate the system without anyone even realizing it's happening.

You determine something is stolen the same way bitcoin determines if a transaction is legitimate: enough trusted peers agree.
the need to confirm that the theif owns the address isn't necessary if I'm only concerned with the value of adding friction to spending stolen coin. So, my answer to you is, if I receive 1000 bits that came out of nowhere and I try to spend them, when someone tells me that the bits were stolen, it will make sense. If I'm a good person, I'll look up who they were stolen from and contact them. Otherwise, I'll just clean them until I can spend them.
yes, the theif could create a 1000 addresses, split the stolen coins, maybe mix them with real coins to dilute them, etc... effectively cleaning them. My question is, does forcing a theif to do this have value? 
Most thieves are lazy opportunists. If it's hard to clean, they'll find something easier to steal. But maybe it's impossible to make bitcoins hard to clean?

they only need the longest chain such that everyone else starts accepting it. They only need 6 confirmations in a row if they're 5 confirmations behind
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:36:04
SatoshiDice cleverly uses the money you sent them to send you your winnings. Which means if you double spend your bet, you are forfeiting your winnings. This is the only reason they get away with instant 0/confirmations.
6 confirmations is based on no one person gaining more than 30% of the cpu power for the network.
I don't know what to tell you about having to wait, I've had to wait for nearly every transaction I've ever made.

It's not centralized. The only thing about ripple that is centralized is the stockpile of XRP, and the reason they did that is so they could monetize the network... like a real business.


Here's the [client source]( and the [gateway source]( The only source that hasn't been released is the [validator source]( however, I believe it still counts as open source because everyone who is currently running a validator has access to the source code.


Denial of service protection for the network as well as a way for OpenCoin to monitize the network.


You should! Ripple and bitcoin are not in competition. Ripple is a p2p currency exchange... which means you could buy bitcoin through it. You could also make bitcoin transactions through it which have the benefit of taking less than 20 seconds to complete. I would never advocate using IOUs for long term savings storage, but it makes for great microtransactions or transactions that require confirmation speed.


wrong, just like bitcoin, the ripple network enforces the amount of XRP that can exist in the system. No more XRP can be created, even by OpenCoin.


1 XRP = 100,000 IOU transactions. XRP are cheeeeaaaappp. But yes, they will hold on to a lot of them and yes they will give them to their buddies and supporters. It's in OpenCoin's best interest that the network gains support and strength, and it's unlikely that XRP will grow in value so much that it becomes anything less than cheap.


yeah... this isn't entirely OpenCoin's fault... but they have failed to educate people. People see XRP and think "it's just like bitcoin!" and they want as much of it as they can so they can get rich quick. These people are going to lose a lot of money. Do not invest in XRP unless you intend on running a major gateway... and even then, I bet OpenCoin would be willing to give you a ton of XRP for free.

Receiving bitcoin through a business will only be as anonymous as the business wants it to be. What happens to the currency is only as anonymous as you want it to be. Does that make sense?
For instance, say you get some coin from mtgox. I guarantee that they keep records of who you are, how much you bought, and what addresses they sent and received from. It's not public information, but with enough external pressure, assume that they will release your information to save their own ass.
But, say you took that coin you bought and sold it to a stranger. That stranger is anonymous and he could spend the coin anonymously, no tracking of him would be possible.
All that said, I felt the same way you did when I first found bitcoin... But then I read a story of a guy who walked into wellsfargo and was explicitly transparent about his intentions to purchase 10k worth of bitcoin. That's when I realized, transparency is just as safe as anonymity, assuming your intentions are honest.

You're right, they could have done it without the XRP. But, they are not hobbiests, they're a business. They want to make the world better, but they also need to make money. Is there a problem with wanting to get paid for your work?
And remember, 1 XRP = 100,000 IOU transactions. XRP is cheeeeeeap! Especially compared to the current fees associated with exchanging currency at a bank.

Those with the most money always have a voice, they don't need a foundation. The foundation needs to represent and foster the community, internationally and in government. The other candidate's pessimism on trying to influence government is the wrong approach.

You wouldn't be putting your trust in people, you would be putting it in businesses. Imagine getting a BTC IOU from MtGox, CampBX or blockchain.info. 
BTC IOUs are the holy grail of Ripple. Ripple effectively allows you to exchange BTC in less than 20 seconds. Think of it like how the US dollar used to be backed by gold in fort knox. A Ripple IOU is backed by your digital gold, but instead of trusting your government not to default on you, you trust a gateway on the network that either has name recognition or that you know personally.
