AFAIK, there is no legal requirement in the U.S. to investigate customers as Coinbase is doing. They are *over*complying, which is the rational thing to do when regulators (and banks) or on hair-trigger alert for any whiff of wrongdoing and when customers don't complain. So? If you want financial privacy, complain! Thank you, @_date: 2015-12-19 16:31:54
So far as I can tell, the material you quote is from PWC's summary of requirements in Uruguay. Perhaps Coinbase is complying with the demands world's most intrusive regime. If so, users everywhere else are right to complain about over-compliance.
But I am skeptical of summaries like this in any event. For a long time, U.S. accounting departments have collected SSN from all payees because the consensus is that they have to. (I imagine their software writes that requirement in, in disregard of private payees' privacy.) In fact, the requirement didn't apply to payments of under $600 and reimbursements of expenses (i.e., non-income to the recipient). I say all this in the past tense because the IRS may have taken advantage of that consensus to make it a blanket requirement  since I last looked into it.
I've looked into this, and I believe U.S. law doesn't require Coinbase to collect source of funds. The best contrary evidence, because I may be wrong, will be U.S. law, regulation, or guidance.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:31:05
I don't know that the colloquial name of a regulation proves its content. But I was imprecise. The requirement to investigate customers' source of funds is not required by any regulation. Show me to be wrong with the statute, regulation, or guidance. Coinbase couldn't.

Oh, grreat! Now Coinbase can get your source of funds and keep it on file for when the government comes calling! ;-D

It was prior to your arrival as E.D., Bruce, but there was [some effort at putting together a plan]( It was summarily rejected by the legacy members of the board as they were utterly hostile to Olivier and me when we came aboard. Some may not have even been aware of these ideas due to inattention. The material at the link is just one idea. I believe I would have supported and worked on any sound plan. Relations improved, but the board never returned to putting together a plan for the foundation, and there is none today.

I think you've identified the moral actors well, but as a practical matter, Coinbase and other companies are best positioned to influence the policies under which  they operate. They're indifferent. If customers don't ask for privacy, they won't deliver it, and they'll accede to every demand of regulators. If customers ask for privacy, threatening to leave and leaving their service, they will work on that issue for us. So I think yelling at Coinbase is warranted and useful, even while we forgive them as moral innocents.

I think it will change in the second round, but the question is how much.
When asked by one reporter, I said that the amount of change to the BitLicense in the second round turns on Superintendent Lawsky's political self-confidence. If he is self-confident, he'll say, "You know what? We came out of the gate in the wrong direction. I'm going to turn this around and head the other way." That would be impressive, fearless leadership, and it would win praise from a lot of quarters, including this one. If he's not self-confident, he'll stick to his guns and just push a slightly modified "BitLicense" through.
It's rude to talk about a person this way, and I don't mean to be a judge of Mr. Lawsky's personal characteristics. I'm talking about how he does his political calculating.
We haven't communicated with the DFS other than through comments. That's just happenstance. We aren't set up to be effective advocates on the ground in New York --- the Bitcoin Foundation has limited resources, it takes time and money to know a jurisdiction and a regulatory arena well --- so we're dealing with the DFS entirely through formal processes. Plenty of people (particularly New Yorkers) are communicating with the DFS, and there are efforts out there like the NYneedsBitcoin site that are community driven. We're just one part of the process.

Risk aversion in financial services has quickly risen to the top of our concerns (validating what we found in our risk management study).
Financial services providers are steering clear of Bitcoin due to no particular rule, but because of the general sense that Bitcoin is risky, and the relatively small market Bitcoin currently offers. What does a rational financial services provider do? Steer clear.
Because there's no law or rule to change, the only thing we can do is educate as many relevant people as we can about BTC. Talk to well-placed regulators and public officials. Let them know the huge benefits, such as global financial inclusion for half the world's people. Work with them on making sense of Bitcoin from their perspective.
There is more being done on the commercial side, and Foundation folks are talking to banks and other fin serv providers all the time. At some point, the damn breaks and Bitcoin companies will be unremarkable banking clients. Then the financial services providers will get into providing Bitcoin based services themselves.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:35:58
For the most part, they're neutral, with a lean toward preserving things as they are (because that's what they know). We sometimes compliment ourselves by assuming that we're more important and better recognized than we are. I'm often talking to people who have heard of Bitcoin and don't know much about it, and really don't have a strong opinion one way or the other.

@_date: 2014-10-14 18:37:53
I think others are watching to see what happens with New York. The lean right now, given community reaction, is away from following the "BitLicense" idea. The bulk of the jurisdictions are integrating Bitcoin into their existing regulatory regimes rather than trying to come up with new rules.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:08:20
It is very hard to come up with an answer to this that isn't a whole book. I don't know that I have any haters, but if I do...
The "haters" for whom I have the most affection are the ones who think I'm part of the problem because I talk to people who are part of the problem.
I have a view of how social change happens. Some believe it happens when you declare independence, but declarations of independence are actually the culmination of deeper, longer-running shifts in society. I'm working on social change right alongside some of my haters (again, to the extent I have any).

I was game to answer the one or two parts of this "question" that could be interpreted as pertaining to what I do at the foundation, but having seen the vulgarities you posted about me elsewhere on this thread (now apparently deleted), I think we're done.

The New York Department of Financial Services cited "extensive research and analysis" in the announcement of the proposed rule. We asked for any methodical analysis they did in support of the rule, they said they'd share it, and they're required to share it by law. Then they said it would take 120 more days --- that's something like early December.
I think it's very important to have this information. It will allow the Bitcoin community to assess the risks that the NYDFS has found. It will help the Bitcoin community better address the risks the NYDFS has found. Getting access to this research will open up a whole new, productive conversation about the "BitLicense" proposal, what works, and what doesn't.

@_date: 2014-10-14 16:20:30
Risk aversion in financial services is the most significant. That's a big, diffuse problem, and it's caused by the many different regulatory regimes in the financial services area (as well as the smallish market Bitcoin offiers).
The reason why this is a focus is because integrating Bitcoin with conventional financial services is the most likely to drive adoption. And wide adoption is what will really make Bitcoin take off.
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:02:40
Alas, regulators -- at least on the law enforcement side -- do not see it as part of their job to provide any reassurances. It could be that banks or a banking association could work to reassure themselves and others, but there has to be something in it for them, and right now Bitcoin businesses and services appear not to be a large enough market to justify their sticking their necks out. (Don't blame the messenger!)
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:34:40
Our request was under New York's Freedom of Information Law. I don't know if it will come to seeking personal emails and such. I'd like them to just put out their research (or I guess say they don't have any).
The Foundation doesn't have endless funds, nor I more than 24 hours each day, and New York is just one jurisdiction. The United Kingdom, for example, has a Chancellor of the Exchequer who is committed to making his country a center for financial innovation. I was over there and actually filed our New York comments from London last week. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:48:50
To assist people who want to avoid New York (or any other state that ends up being hostile to Bitcoin), we produced a primer on the law of jurisdiction. You can turn away...
There is a theoretical case against an unelected official having the power that New York's Superintendent of Financial Services has, but it's an academic discussion that wouldn't likely end up having much effect on policy outcomes.

I'm aware of the concerns, but have to confess that I don't follow the issue closely. I'm not in management at the Bitcoin Foundation, I don't participate in board meetings, etc.

I try to channel and fairly represent the views of the Bitcoin community, which are quite broad and diverse. I take my pay in Bitcoin, and I carry Bitcoin with me every day. Sorry to hear it if I don't have your respect.
As a person who has studied transparency closely, I don't know how to respond to a request for "transparency" undefined. What things in my bailiwick would you like to know about?
Here's my study from a couple of years ago seeking to define government data transparency more acutely, btw:
I put together the risk management study to make our work easier to oversee. Introducing it on the blog, I wrote: "I don’t want to work for an organization that subtly prioritizes its own growth over its stated goals, or that feeds key parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem to the political maw in the United States or elsewhere. So we need the oversight of the Bitcoin community to hold us to account. Risk management and regular, open reassessment is meant to make us and you more aware of the challenges to Bitcoin we see and what we’re doing about them. If, over time, we fail to solve them, you’ll be right to ask why and demand that we do better."
So please ask specific questions about the work we're doing!
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:18:14
Well, my intention when I started was to formulate the high-level public policies that are best for the Bitcoin ecosystem --- getting a hold of the consumer protection issues, law enforcement vs. privacy trade-offs, capital controls, etc. --- then propagating this thinking far and wide, both directly and through our affiliates, so that governments would adopt the policies most felicitous to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
No plan survives contact with the enemy, and I have spent most of my time responding to urgent demands as they arise. Countries around the world are doing things and saying things about Bitcoin. I'm pulled in a lot of directions, and the Foundation has resource limitations, of course. We are slowly but surely building the intellectual infrastructure and the systems to advocate well for Bitcoin everywhere and on every issue.
I think we've done a pretty good job of setting up a system for introducing Bitcoin to legislators and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. Doing that is half the battle, because if you can demystify the issues and present a responsible face, people will calm down and think clearly. When you explain Bitcoin to someone and see the lights go on, it's a great pleasure.
Thanks for the question!

I went looking for evidence that Watson or Uphold are suing Antonopoulos and found only that Watson said [he would speak to his lawyers]( Anyone got more evidence of an actual suit?

If you're referring to my affidavit, it mentions the EBA assessment to show that other regulators at the time were doing public assessments. That, I think, helps show that the DFS should have, and it supports the argument that the regulation was written arbitrarily and capriciously.

I didn't do any press release. I think Olivier is referring to the post-election interview I gave to Coindesk. I gather that Patrick and some on the board felt that my being not dishonest about the condition of the foundation damaged the foundation.

I'll save people time: I know that Core is a loose coalition of individuals and not an organization. That's a challenge for Core. It doesn't mitigate the problems that result from the paucity and incompleteness of their communications.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:53:46


This is good news only in the sense that it makes me feel like I'm not alone. It is very hard to learn Core's security modeling, responses, plans, etc.  There have been good faith efforts, to be sure, but those are occasional and, frankly, aimed relatively narrowly at coders.  Some source should provide a consistent, complete articulation of the Core vision. It would probably save you time here on Reddit, That is one of the more minor costs of Core's relative insularity.  I wrote at some length about this [back in May](

Thanks for the follow-up.
In the language you quote, I link to a December 14 tumblr post of mine asking the foundation to schedule the election, which was supposed to happen in January. ([Here it is again]( It was already very late at that point to schedule a January election. When they finally did a few days later, it was for February (the reason I put "January" in scare quotes). That left enough time for campaigning, but the tardy scheduling is part of an overall lackadaisical approach to the election. 
The foundation's promotion of the election has been lackadaisical as well. That makes me sympathetic to the folks wanting to vote who are now learning what the process is. I would have preferred the foundation to be sharper on all fronts. 
But I agree with you that the process was not sprung on people who were paying attention. If this were an election for public office and people brought a legal challenge claiming their voting rights had been denied, I think they would certainly lose.
Recognizing the likelihood that people might miss the requirement to confirm their email addresses, I sent hundreds of messages to foundation members earlier this week. Did they get them? I don't know.
Summary: Poor process. The foundation should do better (on more than just this front). But I didn't say or mean to imply that it was a snap election.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:28:08
The expiration of board members' terms, including the chairman's, made January the right time for elections -- December, actually. It is not "arbitrary" to hold elections when they are needed. It is ordinary. Doing so would have signaled to members that the foundation's leadership takes things seriously, which would have helped inspire the membership to take the foundation seriously. And perhaps more people would have paid closer attention to the process, and...
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:02:12
Recognizing the likelihood that this could happen, I messaged as many foundation members as I could early this week (excluding other candidates, who I assumed wrongly must know about these procedures -- sorry). Even doing that was a challenge because one can't really tell which identities are members, which are lapsed members, and which are ... in the system for unclear reasons.
Though it was possible to apprise oneself of the process, I'm 100% sympathetic to the complaints of those who didn't. Brian Goss, the election administrator, is a conscientious non-partisan, who I don't think is it fault for these challenges. I would look to him for leadership on what to do about the situation in this election and future elections.
In case it needs saying, the foundation owes it to members to do better than this. This is a "January" election, which the board [hadn't scheduled yet in mid-December]( I won't stand out from the other candidates (other than the "shut it down" contingent) in saying that things should run more smoothly.

There's some evidence that the election was supposed to happen in January in [this October, 2014, foundation blog post]( which says in a stand-alone paragraph: "The next election will be held in January 2015."

Thank you, There is obviously more work needed on articulating these attacks. Habitual contrarian that I am, reading your assertion that governments consistently attack competing money systems, I thought of the many [examples where they don't](
I think it's right that they prefer control, so they do attack competitors when they can, but that just begs the question. When can they, and when can't they?
That would seem to be based on some combination of their practical ability to reach the relevant money institutions and actors (jurisdiction, various dimensions of their legal systems) and the political costs/consequences of doing so. (I'm sure that's over-simplified: what other factors haven't I thought of?)
Governments' practical ability to access money institutions can be limited by decentralization, particularly across jurisdictions. The political consequence calculus gets more difficult for governments with widespread adoption. That puts us back at square one. There are two defensive theories that are in some degree of tension with one another.
I also realized as I read your comment that the stronger analogy might not be to the Internet, but to SMTP. There are many more interesting topics and sub-topics, but I hesitate to broach them on Reddit.
Speaking of meta, I don't know that the rhetoric has to get more heated. I think I understand why there is so much venom from the current dissenting group. It boils down to insufficient communications and discussion, which has created an atmosphere that is very hard to dissipate. But we're proving by our example that these things can be discussed openly and well. (If that's not a cue to some troll, I don't know what is!)

Valerian, I've written expressing my sympathy for people who didn't apprise themselves of the process, and I noted my own efforts to inform members timely.

You might consider removing me from the group against which you've leveled this charge.
@_date: 2016-07-16 13:09:31
Thanks, I think both theories of attack are poorly developed, and their corresponding theories of resistance equally so, but I think the adoption theory is a little stronger than that.
Rather than a parallel to bank accounts, about which your point is strong, I think the parallel is to protocols. When government jurisdictions from Egypt to BART have attacked Internet service, the negative public reaction has been swift and clear. Putting bitcoin in that position would be similarly protective. (In ways. The parallels aren't absolute.)
Thanks again. On the meta, I'm trying to show that these issues can be discussed civilly, which is as important as the merits because of the contribution peace and quiet may have for widespread bitcoin adoption. I'm certain that the goals of both "sides" are pretty much the same.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:19:05
Scheduling an election to coincide with (or even precede) the expiration of board terms, including the chairman's, is pretty basic stuff. Brian Goss almost certainly announced January based on word from the staff or the board. Then, the board just didn't get around to it for a while. This has no bearing on the internals of the election process, the main issue on this thread, and it doesn't have to do with the election volunteers, who are universally held blameless. It is another instance where I think the foundation hasn't operated with ordinary professionalism.
