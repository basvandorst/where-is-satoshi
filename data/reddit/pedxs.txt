Can someone please explain to me how this is superior to paying off my credit card with bitcoin, or converting a couple $ usd and storing in a checking account? It is as if you were to convert and store your wealth in a foreign fiat currency, then get a Visa credit card from a foreign bank, and proceed to use it at a Starbucks in the US. Why not just pay USD cash in the first place and avoid all the transaction fees?
This is the dumbest thing I have seen for a long time and gave me a literal face-palm. You basically relegate Bitcoin's status to that of a third world unstable currency.
I understand the need of a payment processor and perhaps even the need to transmit payment information through card/card reader, but it has to be based on a totally new system, or else you are still shackled by the 3-5% these payment processor charges.

forex is pretty good. Ask Bid Spread for most pair is usually 2% through traditional methods.

this is a partial equilibrium analysis. You are assuming hash rate does not drop as price decreases.
Don't even need to think about the future. Just think about how miners profit switch between BTC and BCH right now.

looking at [bx.in.th]( right now. Spread is 2 Baht. Less than 10 cent. Of course there is slippage. If you want to trade 1 BTC it will probably be a 500 baht spread. Still less than 20 USD on a 3500 USD trade.

If the deflation is caused by a monetary contraction, the net effect is still a decrease in money demand. True that deflation increases the real money supply, but this effect is only second order.
On another point, it is not inflation or deflation itself that cripples the economy, but rather the uncertainty surrounding it. Of course, we do not know for sure how much BTC is "lost" per year, but I would argue that the BTC supply is much more deterministic than the USD supply.

I explicitly said that spread is around 20 USD if you want to trade 1 BTC worth. Still less than 1%

agree. even in developing countries the spread is less than 1%, so around net 1% when you add in trade fee and fee to transfer to bank.
All this can be done in the convenience of one's home. Rather do that than have to wait at WU and then go deposit at bank.
It is not going to beat WU in all cases, but when the recipient is tech savvy (e.g. parent xfering money to child), this is a cost-saving solution.

if you actually tried going to the bank as a retail customer you will realize the huge ask bid spread on USD CNY.
On the other hand, there are exchanges on USD BTC and USD CNY with literally zero spread. All you need to pay is around 0.1% free on both legs.

It is his best interest to squash cryptocurrency. England in particular is adamant in not losing control of their monetary policy, and that is why they opted out of using the euro.
Once crypto replaces fiat, then the bank of England no longer has control over monetary policy and becomes redundant.

I think he meant causation instead of correlation; but yea you are right, one cannot really argue about a mathematical definition.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:36:44
I understand, but I am pointing out that he/she is confusing the definition of correlation and causation.

This is more an age thing than a profession thing.
I hold the exact same PhD from the same institution as Prof Stiglitz but am several decades younger. It is actually my training in economics that made me buy my first BTC back in 2012.
I recently revisited my PhD advisor and he was super interested in cryptocurrency and we spent an entire morning in his office discussing it. He is thinking about updating his seminal monetary policy paper with the advent of cryptocurrency.
