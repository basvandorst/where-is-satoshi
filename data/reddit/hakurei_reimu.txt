Remember when people posted about how BFL wasn't a scam because you could always just get your money back?

"The bitcoin" is a Bruce Wagnerism.

All the ASIC victims are shitting their pants right now.

If Bitcoin doesn't adapt Zerocoin, its successor will.
@_date: 2013-10-01 08:15:05
Stop spamming this shit, cultists.

BFL is so bad they make Hitler look like a sympathetic figure in comparison.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:16:10
You're not. That's just the sucker line spread by people marketing ASICs.
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:37:16
Then there's no hope at all.
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:06:10
20% inflation? Thank god they found out about Bitcoin in time to escape such an unstable monetary system.
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:45:00
They're worthless dust.

It's called a brainwallet because no one with a brain has one.

There's one of you born every minute.
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:14:03
You're a sucker.

You got your answer nine posts when a poster mentioned bitcoin is an irrevelant niche that isn't worth their time catering to.
How much has been spent on Humble Bundles so far? &lt;0.5% of the total raised?
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:25:16
Poor choice of name.

Tell me more about how it's not "other people's hardware" when it was researched, developed and made to order directly through their money.
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:38:01
Someone tell me what Coinlab has done besides suck up other people's money.
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:24:37
Zerohedge? Why not WorldNetDaily?
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:08:18
KnCMiner promising not to ship devices is the first realistic announcement they're made.

Start looking up soup kitchens.

Sounds smarter than 99.9% of bitcoiners. His ego is deserved.
@_date: 2013-06-17 15:30:03
They have no right to mine on other people's hardware and pocket the profits.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:09:06
So worthless.
@_date: 2013-08-09 12:25:14
Sorry, but I'm tired of price-gouging merchants too.
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:15:45
Oh sorry, it's six more months now for Monarchs right?
@_date: 2013-08-10 03:20:11
I feel sad for anyone who belives this bullshit sob story. It's a convenient invention to cover for the fact they just told everyone they screwed over for a month+ to fuck off.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:34:06
Get this cultist whackjob out of here.
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:52:31
Thanks for clearing that up; now we know not to take you seriously.

God, Bitcoin is finished in two weeks.
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:58:00
I woud hope you don't need to take a college course to become an informed consumer.

How generous of him to pay shareholders more than they're entitled, especialy after someone mysteriously bought up 2.6 million shares a little more than two weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:22:37
What's there to say about a debit card you can't use anywhere?
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:06:34
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead you in not falling for the ASIC trap in the first place.
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:15:30
The smartest post made in this sub-reddit's history.
