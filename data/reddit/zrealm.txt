Thanks for the advice - you're right, we were using a QR code for our account :)
What are fees like at the moment?
I appreciate all of the answers! It is a worry that as we're doing the transaction the price could fluctuate :(

Thanks for the people who supplied some advice. It sounds like now is a bad time to implement this, and the transaction fees make it fairly infeasable (BTC *might* ultimately prove to be workable, but it seems to have it's own issues, too).
I guess we're going to hold off for another year or two and then maybe look into this project again.

The little bit I left in the wallet is now worth about $1000, so there's a bit of profit, but it wasn't tons.
A 5-10% discount would make it more expensive than accepting CCs. It would be hard to justify that without a significant jump in interest from accepting it.

Awesome - I should know more about our future bitcoin plans after Origins. My biggest concern right now is the lag, since we need to wait for coinbase to receive the coin, send us an email and then the ipad to pop up an email notification. This is largely untested but after this weekend we'll have some ideas at least. My expectation is that bitcoin customers will have to wait between 2 and 5 minutes after their transaction before they're all set.

Our hope is that there will be enough bitcoin-savvy people that we'll do some transactions. The demographic seems to be pretty decent. One of the quirks of this pilot is that we're doing 4 different types of shows - steampunk, comics, anime and gaming, so we'll get to see which demographic embraces it if any.

The problem is the lack of IOS support at the moment for bitcoin. We could use the web interface but that has it's own issues, given how little interactive time we want to spend processing transactions if possible.
Any suggestions on how to best handle this?

Hi - I'm the owner of Foam Brain Games. At this time we're not planning on running any pricing promos (accepting bitcoin is complex enough, especially since we have to use some tricks to do it on iDevices, that I want to make sure it's all good and working before we add any additional complexity). If our pilot goes well for the first few shows, we might for Origins which is the biggest and last show on the list.

We will be (it will be our 5th year there, I believe) but I'm not sure if it will be included in the BitCoin pilot due to staff and equipment limitations. How it does at these four shows will help dictate how quickly we try to roll it out to every show, especially how well our iDevice plan works (since currently we use ipads for all of our credit card processing, it's the only device we know will be at every show)

That might be - does anyone have any experience with it?
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:00:51
Awesome. I have a decent amount of faith that we will have any kinks in the system worked out by then, too! :)

Bitpay would work, similar to Coinbase (which we're currently using). The lack of iOS support is the biggest complexity due to most of our convention equipment being iPads.

It’s impossible to know that, which is why it’s faith - the fact that there is a limited amount of them doesn’t change that, there are plenty of things for which less than 21 million copies exist that did not retain their value despite the relative scarcity
