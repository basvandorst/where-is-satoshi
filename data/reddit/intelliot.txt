The existing debt shows that adding another trillion or so isn’t going to hurt much. But there’s no need for even that. He has a plan to pay for it, even without deficit spending.

Not by much. 10% perhaps, and it’ll take a couple years since prices are sticky.

$1 million a year wouldn’t work because it’s more than people currently earn. $12k is helpful to everyone but isn’t nearly enough for someone to quit their job. It brings people nearly up to the poverty line. That’s exactly where we want people to start; and it’s a lot better than zero.

It will. But rich people consume more (spend more money on goods and services) than poor people. Therefore the net effect is that rich people pay more VAT taxes, in absolute terms, than the poor who the UBI helps the most (because it’s a larger proportion of their income).

Good points, thank you for sharing.

What country is that? The VAT as implemented in most of Europe is effective and not evaded.

It’s based on the poverty line: 
It will be increased over time to approximately keep pace with inflation. It won’t always be a round number but it makes it easy to talk about and understand for now. People know what they can buy for $1000 and saying $974.72 or $1046.83 is just going to confuse people and it sounds even weirder than just saying $1000.

1000 is good because it brings you up to nearly the poverty line. It’s not enough to make anyone quit their job. But helps take the edge off. Read his book, “The War On Normal People.”

Sometimes that is called absolute poverty, but usually it is called "extreme poverty". In any case, that's not the definition I was using. Unfortunately, with language you have to consider the context in order to understand what is meant by a phrase. 
Absolute poverty, here, is a condition where household income is below a necessary level to maintain basic living standards (food, shelter, housing). Relative poverty is a condition where household income is a certain percentage below median incomes.
In the US, the poverty line of $12,140 for one person in the 48 contiguous states is approximately what's needed to pay for basic living expenses of food and shelter, in most areas. That's what $1k/mo gets you, and that line will not change much with the Freedom Dividend.

My 2011 Prius has satellite radio for audio only. Wonder if Tesla vehicles could act as repeaters/base stations for the satellite internetwork.

You are thinking of "relative poverty". We are talking about absolute poverty. The poverty line is the estimated minimum level of income needed to secure the necessities of life. Determining the poverty line is usually done by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.

what software was used to generate the graphs seen in your links  ?

"Just to reiterate, a java applet was never run, clicked on, or allowed to execute by me. I'm reading there was more than one attack vector in the page. There was a java initiated executable payload, which contained at the very least a keylogger - yet within seconds of clicking on the link the withdrawal was already initiated, leaving no time for the attacker to sniff my passwords and manually perform a withdrawal. The password was also changed after the withdrawal. Additionally there could have been a session token theft, or some form of XSS. 
My understanding from two different IT security consultants is that mtgox's website security is sub-par. Instead of everyone trying to blame me or mtgox, perhaps the discussion should be about how we can stop this from happening in the future. I'm trying to make a point that however this trojan was crafted, it is very good at instantaneously emptying out your account. Someone could repackage it tomorrow and this whole story will repeat itself. No antivirus detects it, and it works directly with mtgox's site. I don't understand how some of you feel like this shouldn't be of concern to mtgox."
