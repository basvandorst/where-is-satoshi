Their advisory is actually a pretty good summary for introducing people to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It covers basic safeguarding and explains that you bear all responsibility for the protection of your holdings.

I was having this issue and contacted customer support. They said they were having technical issues and that a resolution was being applied. Minutes later they emailed again with the following message:




Somehow my personal details verification had "come undone" and blocked my recurring buy transaction. I visited the page and re-saved the details and then had no issue buying coins from that point forward. The recurring transaction hopefully should have no trouble executing the next time it rolls around.

The whole "tipping" movement reminds me of NPR fundraising drives when they say: Pay for what you feel like you use.
The thing with tipping though is that it isn't limited to just using bitcoin. If anything, bitcoin isn't really that great for tipping. Changetip operates in a centralized, off-blockchain manner that goes against the fundamental idea of Bitcoin.

Reading through the issue tracker they plan on allowing you to label the individual transactions in an upcoming version of the app. It might be worthwhile for them to implement a tag system to group different transactions together in a similar way having several addresses allowed for.
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:56:47
The dogetipbot went through this exact problem when tipping was rampant in I think as long as frequent abusers are punished then it shouldn't be a problem.

Per the v4.0 changelog


This is unfortunate for those who like to create different addresses with labels to sort their incoming transactions.
Per the [discussion of an issue on the Bitcoin Wallet github](




An update will entirely remove the "your addresses" functionality to make this less confusing. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:03:01
This is Gentleman!
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:12:53
Does anyone else want Changetip to allow us to define a custom address where all tips are automatically directed towards?
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:24:38
From an end-user's perspective, dealing with addresses is cumbersome and requires backing up every single address. By generating then deterministically it's much easier to backup and removes the burden of keeping track of addresses from the user. There's also a security case to be made for using unique addresses for each requested transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:07:43
As of v4.0 the app uses a single secret generated during app installation to deterministically derive all bitcoin addresses. There is no longer a practical reason to manually create addresses since each "request" uses a new address.

I would recommend Coinbase over Circle. It's more established and you can create a vastly more secure multi-sig vault.
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:19:16
Certainly no worse than the Capital One "What's in Your Wallet" vikings.
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:37:17
True. The original 50 BTC rewarded for mining block  [are still unspent]( That being said, coins are not divisible. Each Bitcoin is divisible a million times over and would quickly become diluted should it enter circulation.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:31:26
Nice. Did people just give him their wallets or did they actually transfer on the network? How did you guys receive the coins (paper wallets or did you have to create a wallet somewhere and give the distributor the address)?
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:47:42
It's definitely an interesting concept to consider. One thing that does come up is the "purity" of the first 50 BTC. As soon as a transaction is made with them [from that wallet]( they will (more than likely) no longer be in their "mint" condition. The only way for them to be safely transferred around in their original state is for the actual private key to be shared.

Is there a changelog of the major changes between 1.9.8 and 2.0?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:27:55
Yes, but what I'm wondering is if the amount/volume of the transactions is what did you in, not just because it was going to Coinbase. I imagine if you were sending money with the same frequency/amount to another account it might get flagged too.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:21:01

At current market value, 10 Satoshis is worth $0.0000023. Even if the value of BTC increased 1000x it'd still be worth a fraction of a penny. You are never going to make up electrical costs.
Mining with many low performance chips is not meant to be profitable. They will never be able to keep up with the mining farms that have faster units and much cheaper electricity. 21 is clearly planning something bigger with their network of ubiquitous mining chips.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:54:11
Even if it is 100x more efficient that doesn't change the fact that it will always be an electrical cost to the end user.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:20:34
Since they didn't give you a reason how can you be sure that it's because of Bitcoin. As you mentioned in the comments, you moved large sums (More than $10k in 24hrs) of money around, which is reason enough for the bank to become suspicious of fraudulent activity.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:52:04
Coinbase actually [explains it fairly well]( on their website announcing the feature. Basically, it allows you to have absolute control over your online wallet. In the event of Coinbase being hacked or collapsing as a company, your wallet and private keys (that give you ownership of an address) remain in your control.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:54:14

 Oops, typo. Meant to say that the *cost of mining Bitcoin* will rise, not the price. As hashrate increases, difficulty increases, and the reward gets spread even thinner. A mass-market, cheap chip will never ever be profitable to the user. 21 clearly has other intentions.
