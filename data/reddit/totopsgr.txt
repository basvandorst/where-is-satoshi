I believe both CBOE and CME Group futures are going to be based on cash. That will have no effect on Bitcoin. It is basically a bunch of old men (with lots and lots of money) betting against each other if bitcoin is going to rise or fall without actually buying any coin. Thats how I perceive these futures and please correct me if I am wrong. How can betting on an asset, without buying or selling the asset, is going to affect the asset is beyond me.

Try storing some cash for a few decades and see what happens to its value.

Except if you find a "bag" full of old german notes (ww2 era) they can only be used to wipe your ass...if you find a wallet with old (pre-crash) bitcoins they are worth as much as the new ones.

Thank you kind stranger! To sum up and confirm my new understanding: when a transaction is picked to be included in a number of potential blocks from miners around the world it is not actually removed from the mempool(s) (plural since each node has a mempool) and anybody can pick it till its verified by a solved block. As the information of the newly solved block propagates through the network the mempool on each node updates to remove the now confirmed transactions from their mempool.

I recommend everyone who does not fully understand how money works to read this book.
Quote from description: Where does money come from? Where does it go? Who makes it? The money magicians' secrets are unveiled. We get a close look at their mirrors and smoke machines, their pulleys, cogs, and wheels that create the grand illusion called money. A dry and boring subject? Just wait! You'll be hooked in five minutes. Reads like a detective story - which it really is. But it's all true. This book is about the most blatant scam of all history. It's all here: the cause of wars, boom-bust cycles, inflation, depression, prosperity. Creature from Jekyll Island is a "must read." Your world view will definitely change. 
This is a well researched book full of facts. It is not conspiracy theory..it is not propaganda. Enjoy the eye opening experience.

I believe you are missing the point (ignoring the fact that MOST of the above mentioned "world changers" were products and not technologies. Replacing the above AOL yahoo, etc. with Email, the web, wifi, GPS etc... and then you would be comparing apples to apples). In order for the governemt to create something better they would have to create at least a decentralized permission-less blockchain. If it is not a decentralized permission-less blockchain by default it can not be better. Now one would ask why would the government create anything that they can't control? So they are naturally (not due to lack of capability, but due to lack of incentive) incapable of creating something that can compete with BTC.

It is syncing everytime i start it, and after a little while it states that it is fully synced. Situation changed since my previous message though. The second transaction has now been confirmed. And this one shows in the balance of the wallet. The first transaction is still not visible, although it was the first one to confirm. I can 100% confirm that both transactions were send to the same wallet address and that the address in the blockchain explorer shows both transactions as confirmed, and the full expected ammount under that address. This is a bit bizzare. :\. I am not sure were to take it from here. Shall I send an email to 
support AT lightning DOT engineering? Shall I restore the wallet to the desktop version through the seed? Your advice is going to be highly appreciated.

Ravencoin...good project...but the post doesn't belong here
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:26:32
Hi mate, I managed to solve my problem. I loaded the seed to the desktop app. The desktop app shows only the first transaction, the one missing from the mobile app. So I had two instances of the same wallet, one displaying only the first deposit and the other only the second. I recovered my largest deposit by sending it back to my samurai wallet from the desktop app succesfully, so now I have the mobile app reflecting accurately the balance of the address. Problem solved, bug confirmed. I suppose it is only in alpha testing, but maybe something you guys can look at.

I know the feeling...I have been trying to convince people to but since it was 230$. Some they are polite enough to pretend interest, some are always knowing better, some they try to argue against it and me having a quite good understanding on how both bitcoin and fiat work I usually corner them till they decide they don't want to be "convinced" by discussing it. My track record has only two successes over possibly 20 attempts, both very good friends of mine. We are nowhere near mass market adoption yet.
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:31:30
Thanks for the reply, I will send the email. I would be very surprised if the funds were used by autopilot, since the first transaction (the missing one) was ten times the amount of the second.

Because I speculate that not everybody damped the alts as soon as they could due to a non aggressive stance against the forkers. I do believe BTC is bitcoin and that bcash is driven by greed and power lust but to be on the safe side I retained the alts.

I am sorry for your loss...
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:21:17
I didn't express my self very well I suppose. I have given the impression that I am crusading for people to buy. What I meant is that I had 20 casual conversations with other people in my immediate environment about bitcoin during the last 4 years. I actually do not advise to buy, but to learn more about it and only buy if they feel they understand and have their own positive opinion about it. Anyways your point was well put.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:31:25
Don't get me wrong, I would much rather have no forks and one happy united community, but I kept all forked alts and see them as bitcoin bonuses. In a sense if I didn't have btc I wouldn't have the others so they count as part of my btc value. See where I am coming from?

u/roasbeef thanks for all the work you guys put. I have installed the android app and I am facing a worrying issue. I have created an new wallet and recorded the seed. I went to the "Add Coin" page and transfered to the address an ammount of bitcoin in two different transactions from my Samurai wallet. This was about 10 hours ago or so and one of the transactions has been confirmed on the chain (41 confirmations) but the balance on the lighning wallet remains 0. Initially I thought I may have screwed up and send the coin to the wrong address (that would be a first for me since 2015). But I confirmed that I sent it to the right address through block explorer. And I confirmed that the address contains all the coin I sent. Any ideas why I doesn't show in the wallet although I sent the coin to the right address (as displayed in the "add coin" page) and one of the transactions have been confirmed (the other one i sent with very low fee and it is still pending). Thanks in advance

So we are getting taxed directly, then we are getting double taxed through inflation (printing money for bailing banks and governments, if you think they print money to serve the public think again, most of it goes to government bonds and corporate loans, or paying off previous loans and bonds), and surprise surprise, we will now get triple taxed on everything we save that is not immediately converted to some product you don't really need (feeding the corporations) or to some financial "investment" they are getting a cut from. Brilliant. Those Keynesian economic fans see that as boosting the economy. How is that done by reducing the majority populations economic power and sovereignty I don't get. If there is anybody in here that got an average income raise of 3 to 5 % every year (just to battle inflation and retain their original economic power) by the same employer raise their hands please. How the F*% boosting the economy does not boost everybody's income? It is because it is not boosting the economy...its boosting bankers, governments, and mega corps that are too big to fail and will be eternally bailed just to be able to keep paying their installments. BTC is our only hope.

Very wisely put. If you noticed I didn't say loosing ALL the power, some power would do very nicely though. That will give them some initiative to actually think twice about 99% of their products and services that at the moment are ALL designed to make you loose as much as possible without putting them into jail. Regarding beating the system though...it actually has been beaten numerous times in the past. For example the system of using gold for purchasing goods and services was beaten by the IOU paper system. It took them decades but they made it what is it today.
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:31:05
I put this together, because I thought it is a good analogy. Hearing, the usual mainstream concerns that Bitcoin is not user friendly, not safe, not going to scale, not fast enough, has no market, not for the every day Joe, is like looking at the "Bertie the brain" tic-tac-toe game back in the 50s and being certain that it will never be developed to something better than that in the future. Well it did...like any technology.

I have to disagree, but If you used "Virtually the vast majority" instead of "Virtually all" you would be right. :)

I only thought about this when I read that Ayre, after visiting the N chain team he stated that was pleased to say that everything is going according to plan... That immediately removes the propability that the plan was to replace BCH. So if that was not the plan... What was it?

Well I am not sure why you believe it is scammy. Scammy it is when you try to lure people into something that you know for a fact that is is not going to give them any benefit. On the contrary when you are trying to get people into something that you truly believe it is going to be good for them, I would rather call it a selfless and responsible act.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:54:28
Yes the blockchain,info fee is 0.008 as i said before. Bitstamp doesn't charge on bitcoin withdrawal (i believe). By the sounds of it, the transactions complexity based on the fact that i wanted to send all 6.1 BTC to a single address was all under bitstamp's control. So if I have broken down the transfer to eg 6 separate 1 BTC transfers I could have ended up paying less overall? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:59:48
Looking at the transaction, it seems that there were 10 inputs consumed to create 12 outputs for a size of 3370 bytes . From what are you saying this is expensive for this one transaction but somehow will act favorably for future ones?
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:14:55
it was more than 12 BTC. If it plays a role is there a way to affect it in the future?
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:12:39
ok, I am having that "being noob" feeilng. On reading your perfectly articulated response I am getting the impression that I had some kind of control on the "complexity" of the transaction. The only thing I did, was withdraw an amount from bitstamp to a single adress destination. How can i avoid ending up with complex transactions in the future? Looking at the transaction 12 outputs one of them is the full ammount i transfered going to my single address. The rest of them go to unknown addresses. So bitstamp tapped to 10 inputs to create my output plus 11 that go to other addresses. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:20:52
hmmm.. I transferred from bitstamp to my wallet. Wasn't given any options regarding fee size selection. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:11:31
Thank you. Case closed. ☺️
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:17:55
funny you say that, I thought their prices are quite high in comparison with bitstamp. about 40$ per BTC more as we speak. So arbitrage would work the oposite way. Buy BTC at bitstamp transfer to bitoasis, convert to fiat transfer to bitstamp buy BTC, and repeat the cycle. Not sure if it si going to be profitable if you don't move large ammounts, and then who knows what kind of flags it will raise. Will be interesting to know if anybody has done it.
