One could construct an fund that effectively was inverse to the dollar but only amplified its long BitCoin bets when Gold was also trading down counter intuitively in lockstep with the sliding dollar. This would identify the handful of optimal entry days per annum.

These guys are shills who are rumored to be paid for by Butterfly labs. Think about it. Lots of critics of companies but not ButterFly Labs the company who created the most headaches

Hash rates for BitCoin went up 35% today but all the miner speeds sat still.....wait.....no...LeaseBit miners speeds upgraded.....lease-to-own the worlds first speed upgradable miner!

Anybody who lost money to Butterfly Labs...we will give a $600.00 LeaseBit SCUMy miner credit. Just email some documentation to rowan Our miners lease price jumps from $159.00 to $199.00 a month November 3rd. We have two 25 stacks of miners available.

In contrast the Braun 1 from LeaseBit is an ugly pig. But with hashrates climbing and BitCoin prices breaking out...muscles may be better than looks...Rowan A. Salter author "Depression 2015."

I agree. My marketing people said 100 out of 100 of our lease to own Bitcoin miner sales went to males. Our team has broken open several tech products. The closest "male only" was pagers in 1991. Female buyers did not start till 95.

Yes!  is where they obtain their miner!

We wont have to wait long. The fiat system collapses the third friday of August 2015. Rowan A. Salter

Bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2013-10-14 01:51:52
Your view is correct. All alternate currency should support Bitcoin. Bitcoin fails we can all pack up and go FIAT.

The key to identifying scams is to ascertain how accessible are the principals. Access one and ask them to explain there knowledge base and motivation. Scammers cant be accessed and will not be preaching Bitcoin evolution and paradigms.

The very best analogy is that Bitcoins are digital gold...reference Rowan A. Salters book Depression 2015. He emphasises what is good for gold is good for Bitcoin. He just points put the swindlers at Goldman Sachs are not (yet) embedded.

It means every rich old person needs a techno front man with their hands on the handle bars. It means turnkey programs like cloudhashing and leasebit will rule the day.

It has spent a lot of time and effort Ting us up to collapse the dollar.

He won't do that until the dollar crashes in August of 2015. If he was smart enough to create Bitcoin a little currency market timing should be in his grasp....rowan/leasebit

Its like South Africa in 1923. Those that did not drink in the new mining technolgy withered. LeaseBit allows you to mine at 1.25 Thash/s with upgrades built into the lease cost allowing the miner to " expand" to up to 1000 Thash/s over the 60 month lease-to-own term.

BitCoin evolves again with the PayPal news!
Mining evolves again with 
Announcing SCUMy (Speed Constantly Upgrading Miner) starts at 1.25 THash/s and is continuously upgraded during a 60 month lease to own program. 
Our 20 slot Board can deliver up to a hypothecated 500 THash/s by the leases end. Your miner is water cooled, cold roomed, powered, engineer supported and upgraded﻿ every 90 days for more hash rate.
This is the only miner program that makes sense in the current speed/ BitCoin price environment. All this for $199.00 a month with no Social Security or I.D. needed!

As Bitcoin evolves we should de delighted when the fringes of the financial industry will take coins off the market place for several years.
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:02:18
This will happen. Leasebit is developing a "lobbying" team we will "fund" a Bitcoin expansion spokesperson every 500 leases. Apple is a priority. They go with Bitcoin, everyone follows.
