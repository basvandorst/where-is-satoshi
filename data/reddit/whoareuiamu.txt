Since you are using a lot of antivirus scanners, could it be one of them is malicious and sophisticated enough to steal your details? To be honest, one trusted anti virus scanner is enough if you are planning not to touch the device for a long time after creating a wallet.
Another issue is how trustworthy is your forensics security specialist?

This is becoming funny. Binance in its previous replies had REPEATEDLY and CONSISTENTLY asked you to take legal action. So where is your updates on your lawyer's progress that we all have been waiting for? Repeating the same old post would do nothing than raising even more suspicious on your motive behind this post as well as other similar posts.

I apologize if that statement came out as provocative. It was done as a means to invite people to engage with those questions.
It would be better that if you could answer my questions. 
Thank you.

It is not much problem for those riches. My concern is: Would ordinary people feel satisfied with these fees?

This question definitely need more visibility and serious answers.
Here are my questions to sustainability of bitcoin in future where mining rewards are near zero.
1) if lightning network becomes mass adoptions, how would miners get their profit through transaction fees? Of course , there are bound to have transactions occurs on-chain ,but that doesn't deny the fact that lightning network takes charge  most of the day to day transactions.
2) Many people have suggested that bitcoin price would be high enough that miners can still earn some profits through transactions fees. The problem is who would want to transact on-chain,  assuming that 1btc=1m USD and average transaction fees is like 2570 sat. That is like 26 USD per transaction.
3) Regarding to altruistic miners mining at no profit just to keep the network alive, how would they guard against a 51% attack?
Convince me so that I could HODL longer until it becomes a reliable currency in the world , otherwise I will sell in the next bull run.
