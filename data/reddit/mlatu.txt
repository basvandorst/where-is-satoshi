Actually if i have had the spare money i would have bought a hundred bitcoins right after the last "crash" (when Mt. Gox got hacked i think) just to sell it sometime around now.
Of course Bitcoin is not only an investment opportunity, but at the moment it certainly is a big one.

Oh, ok. I hope they are stored as fixed point values...

wait for the bubble to burst.
or buy now one, sell it when the price hits 400 (dont wanna be greedy or do you?) then wait for the bubble to burst, and buy another for a fraction of the price you payed for the one you buy today.
or, just dont.

What's Litecoins?

I don't think the bitcoin will continue to rise for a long time. if i had 17btc i would be watching the exchanges really closely and sell as soon as it would begin to drop.
That way you can buy bitcoins from your profit after that bubble has burst and wait for its next iteration.

Well, when you forget your password to your local wallet, the bitcoins in it are lost. Thats what i mean by "deleting them".

Im wondering, how on earth can all those transactions be done so quickly if they need to afaik be processed by miners somehow to become valid?
