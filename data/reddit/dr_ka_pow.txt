Okay and that 20% if for the short-term right? I think we should be paying 15% for long-term but I could be confusion that. Thanks

Checking them out now. The cheapest one looks a little flimsy. I'm guessing these things are easy to break? Would it be worth it to spend a bit more for the ledger nano?

I use an app on my android called Lawnmower. You link it to a coinbase account and it allows you to set up a recurring investment from either every day to every month.

Honestly I was not aware that coinbase had a reoccurring buy option.

So if you have the master seed, then what is the purpose of having cold storage for added security?

Hi, 
thanks for doing this AMA, I know it is really useful for the community. I am a recent college grad and just began my first job out of school. I have only been working sense August and just received my W-2 for the 2017 tax year. I have made under the 15% tax bracket because I have not worked a full year. Had I been employed sense January I would be in the 25% bracket. I am wondering if I can claim the 0% long term capital gains because of this fact. Not sure if the IRS extrapolates out your wages to a full year to put me in the 25% bracket or not. Thanks for any advice you can provide.
