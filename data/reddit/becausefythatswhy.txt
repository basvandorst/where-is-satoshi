Is there Any monetary benefit to owning a btc node?

I invest in bitcoin and work in a major bank. The banks are serious about bitcoin, because of clients demands, and the block chain technology. I am extremely optimistic about the next few weeks, because institucional investors are the ones who will bring in the real money. Of course, most of them will only invest in 2018/19.

You shouldn't make investments decisions based off redditors opinions. For that go to more specialized forums, learn about the tecnology, and learn more about investments overall in investment focused sources.

Yup same here. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:56:32
True, mostly with treasuries though, so it's a bit different

That's great for Europeans! Go EU!
However that's not the case for most of the rest of the world. For the other few billion people that don't get transfers for free, this might be a good alternative.

Dude you're aware that most major financial firms are already trading btc all over the world right? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:12:41

Thanks! I always see posts about them around here. Is a bisq wallet hot or cold? Where is the private key stored? My hardware? If yes, is there a way to recover it if something incapacitates the hardware?

Dude you're aware that disinflation is different than contraction, right? It means more coins will be mined (inflation) but the rate at which it happens is decreasing.

This man deserves gold 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:12:56
It will most definitely 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:20:00
Until 2141 or whenever new bitcoins are still mined, rhe currency will be disinflationary

I had a bit more than that.... Ugh

Ah, the old Kantian vs. Free Will discussion about Ethical decision-making.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:56:09
I know that. I work for one of the firms I was referring to. But there is much more than just hedge funds in the financial markets. Anyway...

Because it is a variable cost not fixed. You stop producing when the cost to make a good is more than the revenue you'd get from it.

Great points. Also their head of block chain left to work somewhere else too. So there's a possible lack of proper incentives there for people in this area.
