How times have changed.
Centralization argument is pretty bullshit. Nobody is asking for 1gb blocks.

60gb received, cap upload to 4x that (re-send everything you receive 4 times) and you have 300gb per month aka 115kbps/850kbit/s
The average connection this day could easily do 10 times as much and still have half the line left. This is if you are sending 4x more than you are receiving - the average node receives and sends the same amount and not 4x.

A google like service farm would laugh at petabyte blocks...
Scale in a reasonable manner. Keep transaction fee pressure at reasonable levels. It's 2018, blocks were never meant to stay 1mb permantly. This sub was begging for 2-4mb daily in 2015.

The only thing I've said is that inflation isn't 4%. You're the one bringing up other topics.
Where have I argued that inflation is good or bad? I'm simply arguing that the inflation goal is 2% and that the real inflation isn't 4% whether you use the index from Reagan era or not.
I have not given any opinion whatsoever on what I think of any of this. In my opinion they are overheating the economy with the low standard interest rates (in pretty much every country in the western world) and it will come back and bite the world in the ass in the coming years, but who actually knows, the inflation target isn't the only contributor to it though and my opinion doesn't matter.

You seem naive. Just because they have 100b annual revenue doesnt mean they can throw 0.1% of it to lower the price on ONE exchange that isn't even top 3 in volume by 20%. How do you explain such a waste to whoever is higher up? You're not accomplishing ANYTHING by doing it.
Not to mention they'd actually have to acquire bitcoins first in order to be able to sell it....

Its cheaper to run a VPS that can handle 8mb blocks for a month than paying 1 bitcoin transaction fee. Worth thinking about the implications of this fact (if a user cant afford a node he cant afford a transaction)
Edit: or you can downvote someone who has been in bitcoin since 2013 and never bought an alt (might have had some namecoin at some point but not sure) for not pushing your agenda. The cost of transaction fees are enough to run 100k+ nodes at the moment. Shit is obviously not balanced. Segwit could have been done as hardfork or they could have slightly upped the limit until other solutions come out. Whatever you think &lt;10mb wouldnt centralize shit and blocks will have to get bigger even if LN etc exist (need to settle on the chain to settle on the chain, thats just how it is). Y'all playing yaselves. I remember 2015 people were upvoting posts pushing dev team to increase block limit to 2mb almost every day. People literally getting delusional, 4mb blocks = 200gb/yr + 1tb data/yr if you receive blocks from 1 node and relay it to 4 more nodes, the people who are fine with 50gb/yr wouldn't really get hurt by it, in hdd upgrades it represents $5 (and decreasing) per fucking year, in transfer its 30kbps. Obviously only institutions can afford that. I could've ran a 4mb blocks node 24/7 for 10 years with the transactions fees i've spent this month. /rant
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:38:09
Dl block from 1 person, relay to 4. 250mb block = 1250mb of data every 10 minutes = 10 seconds to receive and transfer with gigabit net atm, 60 seconds for it to propogate to 4k nodes this way (which, even a lot of consumers have access to today, I used to have it a few years ago and have friends who have it today, the casual bitcoiner does not run a full node today anyway).
It's not ***unthinkable*** even today. It wouldn't work well though. 1mb is well under the limit of what could work well though. Even devs seem to somewhat agree since segwit did increase the possible limit, should have done it as a hardfork (force segwit addresses) though.

Altcoins are better at doing what you found though.
I've never held an altcoin just offering another point of view. Might as well use an altcoin and not pay the $20 fee if that's the only thing bitcoin has going for it.
This problem has existed for years.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:24:11
It's cheaper to run a node for 10 years on your own hardware vs paying 10 bitcoin transactions fees then.
And no. Your node is not really compromised if you verify your software. Unless you are taking large enough payments from the vps owner that they will spoof all your data. But if you're that concerned just run your own node. or double verify shit (look up transactions online).

You seem to have a pretty good strategy, however you can get a lot of profit wiped by one flash crash though.
I did what you did for a few days in 2013. You mean you made 8% btw right? 100-&gt;108?
Basically i used to have some btc and some euro on my account, while market was bullish i'd put a limit buy order bitcoin and whenever it was filled i'd do a limit sell (very high chance of filling almost immediately because market is bullish, if i had problems filling i'd just buy back euro for a tiny loss). Do the reverse when the market is bearish.
Works pretty well in bitcoin. Especially on low/medium transaction volume exchanges. Every 50 or so trades would net around +10%
I found it wasnt worth the stress, even though it was really consistent it was still really stressfull

You are aware you can check exactly how they calculate that there is a ~2% inflation per year right? It's not like it's some conspiracy fake number.
If they felt 4% was optimal they would change their policy and aim at 4%. Simple as that.

Is 250mb blocks unthinkable in 30 years? Block reward isn't going away for a while.
250mb blocks aren't really unthinkable even today. 13tb per year, 1 transaction every 5 days would be enough to pay for a full node, not that we could even reach that many transaction within a few years anyway.
There's really no good argument against doing ~4-8mb blocks today except "it has to be done in a hardfork". It doesn't cause centralization or make bitcoin less safe. Even when we have lightning and other solutions we will still need larger blocks because you still need to settle onchain at some point. It's cheaper to run a full node with 4mb limit for a full year than doing 2 transactions per year atm.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:43:10
I haven't done any argument here. Just stated that 1 transaction costs more than storing the entire 8 year history of bitcoin.
Where did you get the thought that i support increasing the blocksize into infinity?
Here comes my opinions on the blocksize debate if you wish to argue it:  
My opinion is that a 4mb increase today wouldn't hurt bitcoin decentralization in any way - would probably increase the amount of nodes since bitcoin can now be used in transactions for more people - and the only REAL reason for running a node is to do transactions.
If the fee pressure gets too high in the future and technology has progressed far enough that increasing the blocksize again isn't unreasonable, then you can do it again. Maybe LN and other solutions help relieve the fee pressure and that's great as well. There's not much point in discussing if bitcoin will need more increases in the future or not today, nobody knows.
But as it is now the balance is totally out of what - ONE transaction costs more than storing the entirety of the 8 year history of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:36:12
Not harder than to lump sum and withdraw over time. takes like 2-3 months for OP if he uses coinbase doesnt ask for his limit to be raised.

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:17:59
Yes. They are increasing primarily because the fed's goal is to have 2% inflation and since the economy is in a high conjecture there would be deflation without taking those measures...
If you just want to look at those stats then you could argue that bitcoins inflation rate is 4% as well, which is a naive way to look at things. Of course the inflation rate of dollars is higher than 2% if you're measuring it against the amount of dollars in existence.

Afaik mtgox had around 75-150k (1%) btc in its orderbooks at any time when they had 90% volume.
Wouldnt be surprised if the number is still roughly the same split over the largest exchanges
Would be surprised if gdax only has 0.001% aka 160btc.
Edit: gdax is 7k btc above 12k/ea. So a bank would have to acquire 7k btc at 18k ea (100 mil$) just in order to push the price to 12k on just one exchange, not even the largest one. Hf trying to explain how thats 100mil put to a good use

Not sure what you are trying to argue with the paper. In a 12-month period they show that an alternative index can differ by -16.9% (aka instead of 2% you'd get 1.66%).
The alternative index puts LESS emphasis on medical care and other(+education) relative to the actual 1982 weighting. 2016 Index puts MORE weight on on medical care and education(+other) which means that if we used the same weighting as in 1982 we'd have LESS than 2% inflation today, not 4%.
Not going to argue about if CPI is a good measure or not. Your statement that inflation is actually 4% is just invalid, that's all. If you aren't very risk averse it's a good tip to not pay off the mortgage if the interest is low though.

Increasing the limit is still negligible to actually using the blockchain. What's the point of running a node if doing a transaction is too expensive?
Nothing says you can't increase the limit and have the techs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:39:09


Doesnt this fall apart when the fee is as high as it is? If you use the money spent on fees and put them towards hosting full nodes while increasing the blocksize to 8mb you'd still probably have more than 1000 times the current nodes even if every block is full.
Lets say such a node costs $1 per hour to run (600+ per month), youd be able to run 700k nodes (120k$ avg fees per block * 6 per hr = 720k)
You would have a more accessible coin. Right now doing one transaction costs more than having a full node for a month. As a currency, bitcoin is (atm) a big failure in anything that is not a big international settlement.
Note: i do not endorse bch, just wish bitcoin would fix it's shit, and like to argue for arguings sake.

Held on since $10/btc haha. Don't believe in the tech as much today as i did those days - do believe btc has a pretty good chance to reach 100k+ still anyway.
The current price is based on future merit IMO. Wouldnt necessarily call btc overpriced for that reason but as you said it feels very much like a gamble right now, until bitcoin proves itself and gets more established in the real markets.

It goes to the change address.
Lets say you have 2 inputs; they are 1 BTC each, you try to send 1.5 BTC to "someone", 1 BTC from input 1 and 0.5 BTC from input 2 will go to "someone", 0.5 BTC from input 2 will go to a change address. So you're essentially splitting it into 3 inputs. You cannot split input 2 into 2 inputs without doing an transaction is the reason (for bookkeeping reasons, have to broadcast that you want to split the input so that everyone knows -&gt; broadcasting = making a transaction).

Someone sold $10mil (15k) worth of bitcoin and didn't care to set a price limit, aka bought pretty much the whole orderbook.
I think something similar to this happened on an exchange in 2012 - it was a pretty small exchange and someone sold around $20k worth of bitcoin, ~$15k of them went to someone who had a bid order at $0.01/bitcoin or something like that, making him a very lucky guy.
Numbers of the 2012 incident pulled from my ass but i believe it was somewhere around the $10-20k range.

1-4min wouldn't give very high orphan rate methinks. Also i believe all pools are connected to pretty much the same nodes as to reduce the latency/orphan chance as it is already.
1% more orphans at the reward of 5%-hashrate pools being viable is a worthy tradeoff.
edit: 2.5 min confirmation time = ~2% orphans, 10 min = ~1.3%. So instead of 2 orphan blocks @ 10min blocktime we get 9-10 orphan blocks @ 2.5min blocktime per day. Pools that are 4 times smaller at 2.5min have the same variance as one at 10min. Smaller pools have pretty much the same chance of getting an orphan as a big pool.

You actually control your own money - it cannot be frozen by anyone who has the power to do so.
No one controls how much is printed and where it goes - everyone on the bitcoin network needs to agree on the rules set on day 1.
Low-fee instant transfers.
Irreversible transactions, can be both good and bad but it can create some new interesting businesses.
Anyone can open an "account".
Not much else to it really - it just works as money should work, easily transferable from anyone to anyone without a central authority that decides how much money there is and what it's worth.
Sometimes you might not want other people to know who you transact with, with bitcoin nobody needs to know. The most obvious reason would be because you're doing something illegal but there are some other "legit" reasons why you would want to be private.
Creator might have wanted to remain anonymous because bitcoin might anger some powerful people - or maybe because of something else, nobody really knows.

Honestly, yes.
There's some improvements that bitcoin could have but require hardforks, sadly it's almost impossible to have consensus on hardforks in bitcoin though. The way segwit activated was also shady af.
Bitcoins inability to change is a good and a bad thing at the same time. Slightly bigger blocks wouldn't really hurt at the moment as well.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:43:00
At the same time the network is so big now and it's quite difficult to organize hardfork changes. Some might not want any increase at all, some may reason that a small increase now may set a precedence to increase it further later which they might think is harmful for decentralization etc. As much as I would like a slightly larger block I also accept that it may never happen.
I do not support BCH as well, it's fracturing the community and a lot of the people behind it are acting quite crazy. IMO segwit2x would have been pretty good idea if it had consensus with a majority of the current dev team, most other parts of the network was willing to adopt it.

Because of variance.
Easier to get lucky 6 times (to mine 6 blocks faster than the rest of the network) than 60 times. Even though both require the same amount of work on average, there's a higher likelihood of getting a good streak and finding a block faster than average 6 times in a row vs doing it 60 times. It's easier to get lucky 6 times in a row on the 1-min chain vs the 10-min chain though because the required work is less on the 1-min chain.
I MIGHT be wrong on this. And also it's a pretty low likelyhood to get "lucky" 6 times anyway unless you have &gt;30% hashrate so it's not a huge difference anyway unless that's the case.
Lets say someone gets super lucky and mines 2 blocks in 1 second - in the 10 minute chain he'd be way ahead of everyone else and might have a good shot at getting the remaining 4 blocks before the rest of the network manages to find 6 - also he can choose to give up the attack and relay both blocks in case someone else finds one block. In the 1 minute chain he's not really that far ahead in the same scenario - as he'd have to keep up the block lead for another 59 additional blocks or risk losing all his work.

@_date: 2018-07-28 22:23:13
Where do I talk about orphan blocks? To do a double spend you need to mine more blocks than the rest of the network, and removing the transaction you made from the blocks.
If you are able to mine 7 blocks (and not published them yet) while the rest of the network has only mined 6, you can publish your 7 blocks without your transaction to the other party being sent.
There's a slightly higher chance of succeeding when the blocks are 10 minutes vs 1 minute. Even though the amount of work is the same you have higher variance in the 10 minute blockchain, which makes it a slightly higher chance to succeed such an attack by luck.
[ it yourself, if the person trying to reverse a transaction has 40% hashrate he'll be able to reverse the transaction 50% of the time at 6 blocks but only 0.8% of the time at 60 blocks.
The probability to succeed a double-spend is identical after the same amount of blocks on both networks but it's cheaper to attempt to do it on the 1-minute network and you can try to do it more frequently on the 1-minute network. (since you only lose &lt;1/10th of the work if you fail on the 1-minute network vs the 10-minute network). Trying to double-spend in the case where someone waits 60 confirmations in the 1-minute network is way more expensive than 6 confirmations in the 10-minute network though - because you'd have to try way more than 10 times to outmine the rest of the network on 60 blocks vs 6 blocks (unless you have 50% or more hashrate, in which case both networks are just as unsafe no matter if you wait 1000 blocks or not.

Yeah that is one possibility which would make the whole patch kind of pointless if it's intentions were to battle/hinder coinvalidation. It would however work pretty good if someone was trying to make a blacklist.


Encouraging it sounded pretty good to me at first but when you think about it it's kind of pointless since that alone won't stop people from reusing addresses. It won't really benefit many people but it will be a pain for a lot of others.
Well, it will be interesting to see how it works out in the end. I doubt anything will ever progress with coinvalidation though - and even if it does it doesn't prevent non-whitelisted bitcoins from actually being transferred. I don't see why anyone would even trust coinvalidation with their own identity.

Yeah we haven't seen merchant acceptance quadruple, no large money has been injected into new bitcoin startups. Bitcoin ATM's hasn't started showing up here and there. Bitcoin did not frontpage several big magazines/newspapers. The value was over/around $100 before all of this happened. God this fucking anti-circlejerk-circlejerk is fucking annoying, why don't we say everyone stopped using bitcoins and it will go down to $0 tomorrow, it's inevitable and if you say otherwise youre just hoping for a get rich quick scheme.
The ATM's will be vandalized, the merchants who started accepting bitcoin will stop (because that's what happened the last 3 crashes), the $100mil pumped into startups will be written off as a loss and the startups will shut down. It's inevitable guys, we're going back to AT LEAST 2011 infrastructure &amp; prices.

You put up a buy order for 70.012345
Lets say someone wants to sell 100 bitcoins and they set their selling price limit at 70 usd.
What will happen is that it will match him up with people buying bitcoins at 70 usd or higher. It will start by selling to the one who is offering the highest price, so if someone wants to sell 75 bitcoins for 70.1 USD it would first sell those 75 bitcoins at 70.1 USD. Now if the next person with the highest price are you with 70.012345 it would then sell 15 bitcoins at your price to you and then go on to the next person until 100 bitcoins has been sold or until no one else is buying bitcoins for at least 70 usd (and he would have to wait until someone sets up a buy order for 70 or higher).
What happened in your case is that you were the one with the highest buy order price, and there were 5 different people that sold at average 3 bitcoins each to you.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:36:21
The patch was made to make blacklisting harder (blacklisting an address would only blacklist the bitcoins made from one transaction instead of several transactions). However if an extended key was used you could blacklist all the addresses the extended key can hold?
I didn't mean an address would literally be private - just that it would be very hard to identify all transactions made to X blacklisted person to be able to blacklist all bitcoins gone through him.

Okay so people missed the quotation around true worth and are now upvoting "it hurts reading comments in this sub" and suicide threads gets 1000 upvotes because of a 15% crash.
With "true worth" I obviously didn't mean intrinsic value but the value of the whole network itself. How do you measure true worth of a piece of land, do you look only at size or do you maybe take location and other things into consideration too? Now apply that logic to bitcoin, then you have what i meant.
I don't really care that much about the value of a bitcoin, actually if it could remain forever stable at being worth $500 of a 2013 dollar that would be awesome (obviously impossible though...).

Prretty similar indeed.
The chart on blockchained is also not log, thus slightly misleading.
A few weeks ago i remember the ask sum for mtgox+bitstamp+btcchina was at a alltime low of around 25k COMBINED. Today it is around 65k + price per bitcoin is higher, a pretty huge difference.
Sure, in 2012 the ask sum was at around 200k, but bitcoins were also at around $10 (70x decrease). 200k/70=2.85k
But yeah it's not that simple either - the chart with bid/ask sum in USD is a fairer representation though.

Earthcoin will only be mined by people on earth, so doing transactions with it on earth will be done just as it is with bitcoin right now.
Marscoin will only be mined by people on mars, so doing transaction with it on mars will be done in the exact same way, no delays etc.
People in earth will mostly use earthcoin, people in mars will mostly use marscoin. Earth will have "earthexchange" where you can trade earthcoin/marscoin, "marsexchange" will do the same.
If you are currently on earth and want to buy marscoin you will move your money to earthexchange -&gt; buy marscoin -&gt; move it to your own marswallet (last step will take a lot of time because earthexchange cannot do fast transfers to marswallets due to lag).
If you are currently on mars and want to buy marscoin with earthcoin you will move your earthcoin to marsexchange (will take some time due to lag) -&gt; exchange it to marscoin -&gt; move it to your own marswallet.
So if you are in mars and only have earthcoin you will have to wait a few hours to exchange your earthcoin to marscoin but once you have done that you will be able to do fast transactions. The same applies the other way obviously.

You're not taking into calculation that nobody knows that you used the sentence "IJustPutARandomPasswordInMyPasswordRightThere" - it can be any phrase you want it to be. It's 1.2 billion combinations if you know the phrase, if you don't know the sentence you're gonna have to do it for all sentences that exist.
OP's obscure sentence took almost a year for someone to crack, now imagine if he would have used my method, there would have been ~27 million extra combinations for every word the bruteforcer tries (assuming his sentence was around 46 characters), making the time to crack the password somewhere around 27 million years. There is simply no one who is even trying to crack these types of passwords yet because it's pretty much impossible.
Come to think about it you also assumed the bruteforcer knows it's uppercase,lowercase,number,symbol - it doesn't have to be in that order so it's actually even safer than i wrote...
Also if someone were to find out the random 4 characters it would make the password around 46 times harder to crack AND it would only be 1 person cracking vs everyone.
I simplified the whole thing a little, it would be a little less than 27 years because the majority of sentences would be less than 46 characters long. Would probably be about ~25% less characters on average (number taken from ass).

Well I'm not 100% sure it was a ddos but almost, most exchanges are live now and probably have MUCH more traffic than they did just before the price dropped, yet they went down for a minute or two before the price dropped. I actually semi-jokingly called the drop before it happened to a friend on Skype haha ("Will probably drop to $190-210 today, someone just started the weekly ddosing").
I don't really have anything i can't afford to lose either, but it's pretty sad to see almost 50% of the value of what i do have in bitcoins dropping as it's a pretty huge part of my money (I'm not close to losing any money yet (bought in at $10) but it would have been a VERY big win if i had cashed out this morning hah).

re-replying because this is actually a bit false.
You would have 21.7 BTC @ 500 in the end, if you now sell the bitcoins and rebuy you can write off $9000 of those taxes making it $10k(*0.3)=$3k instead.
Also the 21.7 bitcoins you have @ 500 are now "taxed" -&gt; if you withdraw again you don't need to pay tax again. If you had bought 20 btc and held them until price is 500 and then sold - you would have had to tax $2880.
So to conclude: You end up with either 21.7 btc @ 500 and have to pay $3k in taxes, or you end up with 20btc @ 500 and have to pay $2880 in taxes. The first option is clearly favorable.

As long as you don't have fees fucking with you short term trading is very easy. bitcoin-24 and bitfloor offers 0% and -0.1% (Yes, they give you 0.1%).
Easy how-to guide to pretty much guaranteed profits (I'm probably shooting myself in the foot for sharing, but it's not that great of a source to earn money)
1. Don't trade during uptrend (thu-sun is are nice days to be trading)
2. Check if price on your exchange is high relative to other exchanges, bitfloor is usually around $4 higher than mtgox usd most of the time. If price on your exchange is low relative to other exchanges refrain from trading.
3. Check that the spread between ask/bid is higher than $0.3-$0.5.
4. Put limit order at 0.01 or whatever less than highest ask.
5. Once you have sold your bitcoins try to buy as quickly as possible (0.01 above highest bid).
6. If you can get a sure $0.25 profit per bitcoin (e.g. sold at $195, can buy back at $194.75), always buy back if you are not 100% sure you can get a better deal.
7. Doing this with around 3 bitcoins at 0% fee will earn you a minimum of $0.75, You can probably repeat it around once every 10 minutes for a total of 6 times per hour. A lot of times you will get a lot more than $0.25 per bitcoin, and some times you will lose a small sum of bitcoins (unexpected uptrend - I tend to sell at a small loss when this happens)
Personally did this with 4 bitcoins the Saturday before last, had 4.75 btc 5 hours later. Been doing it on and off since that but it's been mostly around $4-10 per hour after that. My biggest losses have been around $6 because of mistakenly putting in bids instead of asks during unexpected uptrends (aka selling bitcoins when trying to get more of them).
Maybe this is just short-short term trading, but since bitcoin is much more volatile than stocks it's in effect the same thing as short-term trading, you just need way less funds to start doing it. The day I earned 0.75 bitcoins I wasn't even using the full 4 bitcoins when selling since I was still kind of unexperienced, mostly sold in lots of 1-2 btc.
[Proof - because why not]( (seems like I lied a bit, was trading up to 8 btc at the night! I think the bulk was from before I was playing around with 8btc though - seems like i had more balls then than i have now haha)

And to extend on how that happens; When a miner finds a block it takes some time before it is relayed to everyone else - until it is relayed to all the other miners they might still be trying to find the block that's already been mined (because they don't know it's been mined). So if they now find the same block there's gonna be a problem with whose block is going to be accepted and whose block is gonna be orphaned.    
tl;dr: It's basically due to latency.

It was not consistent with the mass sell off today.
There was a few semi-big selloffs before the lag started (500-3k btc total)
5 minutes after these semi-big selloffs ALL top 5 exchanges went down COMPLETELY (except mtgox; they just got 500sec+ lag)
Around 2-3 minutes pass with all exchanges but mtgox being down, the drop has not yet officially started but there had been a slight downtrend ever since the ~500-3k btc selloff. Most exchanges are back online with only small lags by now.
5 minutes later mtgox is starting to go beyong 1000sec+ lag, downtrend starting to get really heavy. All other exchanges are almost totally fine.
10 minutes later; the crash has begun. Mtgox is at 1500-2500sec lag, all other exchanges are mostly fine (small lags).
1 hour later: Price has dropped to around $215 but it's starting to cool down, mtgox has slowly climbed back down to 300sec lag.
..5 minutes later: All exchanges go down once again for about 2-3 minutes but quickly come back online with only small lags; mtgox go towards 4500sec lag through the hour. Crash  happens.
Now (3-4 hours later): Mtgox has recovered slightly from $108 to around $140 and lag is "only" around 500sec (or they have halted trading I'm not sure, bitcoinity acting weird). All other exchanges go on as they have done for most of the day.
Worth noting is that almost all of the other exchanges only had a VERY slight lag and only went offline *when things started to cool down*, I've been able to trade on bitfloor, bitcoin24 and slightly on btc-e without any problems (other than the two times they went down for a few minutes).

0-25sec is okay'ish if you are trading on MtGox, if you are trading on other sites you need to watch out for ~150sec+ (on mtgox, other sites rarely lag they simply work or they don't most of the time) as it sometimes can lead to a pretty big drop or gain.

That seems to be it; the problem is that you didn't send any fees (0.0005 btc is standard but even 0.00001 would have worked).
It might take a while for that transaction to go through, I can't say exactly how much time it will take as I'm not that familiar with 0 fee transactions.
What client did you use to send that transaction? I think almost all clients will warn you that 0 fee is a bad idea.

It depends on timing.
Sometimes there are big bids or asks close to market price and sometimes there aren't. If you are lucky you might be able to clear around 100-200 bitcoins without changing the price. Mostly the asks/bids are around 25-100 bitcoins to move the price with around $1. Simply waiting an hour between each 25-100 bitcoin buys will let the walls come back and you can buy at the same price again (assuming mtgox usd price hasn't changed).

Note that i've been doing this for a year and probably have over 2000 trades averaging about 0.2-1% profit each, approx 1 out of 25 trades go wrong and end up costing me approx 0.2-1% each or so. But yes keep circlejerking about how it is impossible.

If this works as i think it does it doesn't really simulate the markets completely.
The part where it goes wrong is when you do a simulated buy/sell the bid or ask doesn't disappear from the real markets. eg; sell 10k btc; wait 3 minutes; buy 10k btc - the simulation won't be able to accurately do that.
As long as you trade with very small amounts you're okay. However you can't take your gains or losses and multiply them by x "because i would have traded with x times the volume on a real market".

The company is "kapiton" for anyone interested. They used to be a solid exchange up until around the beginning of November. After that shit slowly just got worse and worse, first deposits stopped, then withdrawals and now the trading engine is also broken. Long stretches without communication + their ETA's until the site should be up and running was "48hrs from now" a week or two ago.
There aren't really any other exchanges operating in Sweden, there's btcx &amp; Safello but they're not really an exchange, then we also have FYB-SE but i believe they are operating from Singapore.

I believe they only charge VAT on the fee and not the total sum. Also the VAT is included in the 2.4% fee. So you're essentially paying what's on their frontpage + 2.4%... Just as advertised.
edit: For me it says they charge a 4% fee not 2.4%, so frontpage price + 4% (vat included).

It would cost ~150 bitcoins if the attempt to mine 6 blocks in a row to reverse a transaction fails. Also if the attempt to reverse the transaction fails you will not get the money you sent back (duh).
And almost everyone mining at the pool would change to another pool when they notice something shady is up meaning you just fucked up a business that earns ~5-20k bitcoins per year.
So in the end you get one shot to reverse one transaction, if you fail you will not have many ppl mining at your pool anymore. Unless it is a 10000+ bitcoin transaction it would be a very very very stupid move to try to reverse it. I assume that someone who accepts a 10000+ transaction would also wait more than 6 confirmations.

Mostly ~~anonymity~~ privacy reasons. You don't really want anyone to be able to check what services you are using and where you are sending your money to all the time. You're basically taking a screenshot on all of your bank transactions and uploading it on internet. If everyone was using just one address it would be very easy to put a name on almost every single address in existence and then you could easily track exactly who sends money to where for all bitcoin transactions.
It's fine in some cases, but it's recommended to use different addresses when receiving money from different people/services at least. Obviously too late in this case :)

In theory yes. The value is still pretty high compared to before the bubble started (5x increase). But adoption has also increased.

I don't know, I'm guessing anything that is not bitcoin is probably harder, do people actually have problems with being able to capitalize a little on crashes?
Is playing on the spreads and 0% fee's possible outside bitcoin?
I mean I'm actually in the red if you think about the value of bitcoins decreasing, sure i have more bitcoins and more usd/euro than before but they are still worth less combined unless bitcoin recovers.
Edit; well I could probably have euro/usd in my accounts to complement bitcoins and then earn money regardless if the value is going up or down I guess.. Market going up? &gt; earn usd/euro, market going down &gt; earn bitcoins. Never even though of doing the reverse of what I'm doing now lol.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:40:32
Look at market depth on all exchanges. There's less than 200k bitcoins up for sale. And they would have to use their whole market cap to buy it (market cap doesn't equal money on hand so tl;dr they can't afford it unless they sell their whole company - and even if they do so they haven't even bought 5% of all bitcoins)
But as i said - even if 100% of all bitcoins were up for sale you cannot wipe out money by throwing more money at it, it's not how things works.
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:43:42
Bitcoin is volatile because it is not used on a widespread basis by consumers and business owners. As it gets used more it will get more stable.

Silk road automatically converts it to USD during escrow if the seller wants to take less risk.

The one who sets the highest buy price or lowest sell price gets to buy or sell first.
If 2 people set the exact same buy or sell price i believe the one who offered to buy or sell is prioritized.
[Let me explain with a picture.](
Edit: If the current highest price is 30 USD and you wanted 1 bitcoin for 60 USD you would get 1 bitcoin for 30 USD and then get 30 USD back into your account. It kinda depends on who does the puts out sell/buy order first. If you put down a buy order for 60 USD and there is no one selling for that price or lower, you will ALWAYS get 1 bitcoin for 60 USD. However if there was already a sell order for 30 USD and you put down an order at 60 USD you will pay 30 USD and not 60 USD.
If you for example just want to buy 1000 bitcoins and don't care for what price you would just put in "1000 bitcoins for $9999", you would pay whatever the lowest bid price is until you have 1000 bitcoins or until there are no one selling any more bitcoins for $9999 or lower.

I don't think anyone is gonna playback minute by minute on something a year ago (unless it was during a large crash or something). I don't think you would be allowed to refresh full depth every minute anyway - i think the limit is at around 5-10min or you're gonna get blocked.
Anyway: get full depth every 10 minutes, parse out everything that existed in the previous "getdepth", make a note if something from the previous "getdepth" is missing -&gt; congrats, you have probably cleaned out 95-99% of the file.
On mtgox api i think you can use "stamp" to identify if an order is the same as from your old file. You can also remove amount_int and price_int to decrease file size by ~35%. If you do this you're probably gonna end up with files smaller than 50kb per 10min.

Been to all of these links (before), redditisland have been a bit of a help but it's a very different idea though.
I'm from EU where landwatch doesn't seem to list that much cheap land. US seems like the best country to do this in though (some county's don't require building permits - I can't seem to find any information on other countries with no building permits/very relaxed rules).
It's leaning towards trying to figure out if something like this would be possible around eastern Europe. Czech Republic/Slovakia/Hungary/Bulgaria seem to be pretty good locations, bitcoin adoption doesn't seem too high over there though and I'm doubtful if anyone would actually consider moving from their home country "just like that".
If there is actually people who are interested in something in the US i would perhaps sign up to help or set it up (depending on if the law would allow something like this without massive funding).

I'm not sure if I'm correct or not about this but:
Lets say you have an address that has received 2 transactions; one with 1.2 bitcoins in it and one with 1.6 bitcoins. Now if you want to send 1.5 bitcoins to someone i imagine it will take the 1.6 bitcoins (it must take all of the 1.6 bitcoins because the whole sum is connected) and make a "split transaction" where it sends 1.5 bitcoins to the address of your choosing and the remaining 0.1 is sent to another address you own. It can't simply split the 1.6 bitcoins locally into two parts, it has to do so through a transaction in the blockchain.
If you were to send 1.7 bitcoins it would take both the 1.6 and 1.4 transactions, split (let's say the 1.4 transaction) into two piles of 1.3 and 0.1 bitcoins, the transaction will look like this then: 1.6 + 0.1 bitcoins are sent to whoever you want to send 1.7 bitcoins while the 1.3 is sent back to an "change" address.
I might be totally wrong about this though, if someone could confirm or deny that would be great.

~$200 ($201) might be a good idea to buy at if you have dollars on an exchange.
Check [bitcoinity]( for signs of the lag decreasing and if it looks like the downtrend is ending (33%+ green arrows for a minute or two).
You might still get screwed even if it looks like the trend will change, but it's easy to only lose around $10 (buy 5 bitcoins @ 200, if downtrend continues sell them at $198). If you are on mtgox i urge you to not do any shortterm trading due to the lag though.
However if the the downtrend stops you will probably be rewarded with around $50-200 if you bought 5 bitcoins at $200 (small correction into $205-$220).
Just make sure you don't buy in a strong downtrend (basically LOTS of red arrow @ bitcoinity).
edit: Probably not a good idea to buy yet, still lotsa lag and heavy downtrend @ $205.

Have a shot, you know the system (which you shouldn't...), the private key is safe anyway.
It goes this way: private key (DER) -&gt; remove 8 characters -&gt; encrypt -&gt; reverse.
It would be possible to crack it but in real life it is not worth the cost.
Conclusion: it is still much safer than a regular brainwallet passphrase even if the whole system is known due to: 1. needing to know the position of the passphrase; 2. you are using a unique system, brainwallets all use the same system, and because there are a lot of targets a lot of people will be trying to bruteforce passphrase 24/7. If the whole system isn't known it's practically uncrackable (unless someone hacks your brain, preferably using a wrench).

If there is already someone currently selling an bitcoin for 64 USD, you will automaticly accept that offer and pay 64 USD for 1 bitcoin even though you specified 65 USD.
If there isn't anyone selling for 65 USD or lower, you will have to wait until someone is selling for 65 USD or lower. You will always pay 65 USD for the 1 bitcoin in this case because you are the one who waited for someone to sell lower.

Your chart is a little bad (there is a buy and sell order at 622.499, they would match and the 0.01 buy order would dissapear leaving 0.38 in the sell order) - Since this leaves 0.38 in the sell column you would be able to buy 0.38 BTC @ 622.499, the remaining 0.62 BTC would be put as a buy order @ 622.499
2. You are correct - the sell order would be 0.39 (or 0.38 if we consider the 0.01 buy order)
3. No, you have to go for the highest buy order or the lowest sell order first.
3. grey = small order, regular = regular sized order, bold = big order

$10bil is more than 10% of the richest person. He's would be better off actually buying bitcoins with the money he was gonna use attacking bitcoin. Bitcoin takes off? -&gt; He will be much better off than he is now. Bitcoin doesn't take off? -&gt; congratulations, you didn't actually have to spend any time and energy actively trying to kill it.
And for the first paragraph, yes - I just said the money is better spent lobbying against bitcoin. Still, the lobbying might not actually work out in the end and even if it does it doesn't really kill bitcoin, it will only cripple it in the country it gets banned in. It could contribute to the ultimate downfall of bitcoin but not singlehandedly kill it.

It makes the whole thing muddy and hard to do legit bitcoin transactions.
Other bitcoin gains are taxed + Bitcoin mining is taxed, you're getting taxed on all bitcoin transactions pretty much. Impossible to enforce but also almost impossible to follow, so if you want to be legit it will be very hard.
I would say it's a bad thing as this pretty kills legit business unless you get it reviewed on a per case basis.

Has anyone shown interest in buying with bitcoin (mail, forums etc)?
Are bitcoin holders a demographic that play LoL?
How big is the bitcoin network, would it be profitable to adopt bitcoin payments?
One reason why many torrent sites accept bitcoins are because it's been frequently discussed by their members on their forums. A bigger reasons are is of course that it is impossible for them to accept CC/paypal and such.
Simply showing interest where people in charge can see it will help in the cause of them accepting it, people showing interest is probably not the biggest reason anyone accept it though but likely to be in the top  reasons to accept.

Putting a random short password somewhere in your password would probably work much better.
Write down the short password and at what position it occurs (if you think you will have problems remembering it). Even if someone finds the paper you wrote it down on you'll only have 1 person trying to crack your password vs thousands of people - It won't be randomly stumbled upon while doing random bruteforcing.

Don't think it's possible to do it more accurate really.
Scenario: you do 500 trades of $200 in a day, 250 sells 250 buys. Simulation will not even give you close to the same results as the real market would. If every trade impacts the price by $0.1 you will be very very off at the end of the day.
Scenario 2: bitfloor used to have -0.1% for market makers (limit orders i believe?). It wasn't unusual that asks&amp;bids were $0.01 apart. Something like this would again be impossible to simulate.
If you are doing trades that do not have small margins and are not larger than $1000 this simulation kinda works exactly like the market though. $0.1 doesn't matter too much when the difference of the buy/sell is $20+ and $1000 wouldn't move the buy/sell price very much for it to matter.
I guess you could clone the trading api+orderbook of e.g. mtgox and then let whatever the user does actually impact the cloned orderbook making it looks slightly different from the original, then sync with the real orderbook after ~30 or so minutes. It would be quite a lot of work to get everything to work correctly though heh. Whole different ballgame.

Sadly there is not much you can do with only ~$1 worth of bitcoin alone other than either saving it hoping for that $1000000/coin that will probably never happen or passing it on to someone else in a tip.

I have been thinking about and digesting bitcoin information since 2011. Did i anywhere in my post mention anything about getting rich? I wrote that bitcoin is likely not going lower than $200-300 in this crash due to adoption having more than quadrupled in the last 2 months and the price being $100 before the bubble started.
y'know $600 to $200 is a 66% drop. Would I say that I believe the value might go down that much if I was trying to pump bitcoin?

Some critical mistakes, eg:
If you remove ALL the addresses with 0-0.001 (they own 0.00% of all bitcoins together... aka do not matter/are spam)

A 1min block creation time would help for this. Less variation for smaller pools.

Because the blocks go through the pool - and the pool can insert bogus transactions into the blocks.
If more than 50% of the blocks mined has these bogus transactions in them, it makes them non-bogus in the eyes of clients (aka they will be accepted as a real transaction)

Kind of hard to say how much is held by the top 50 - have to take into account that a lot of high value wallets are shared wallets. I would personally guess it's around 25-35% depending on if you count satoshis wallet or not. But who knows.

Every time bitcoin is in a bubble we see adoption and new services grow at several times it's usual speed. Bitcoin also gets a lot of media attention during the bubbles which in turn brings in a lot of new people who are interested not only because of the potentional gains but because of the technology.
There was not much you could do anything with bitcoins 2 months ago, today it is very different. A lot of funding has also been poured into startups that has yet to deliver their product yet so there is more to come in the close future.
Look at it more as a small shop somehow making its way to reddits frontpage. Their sales will "bubble" that day, but some of the customers are likely to be repeat customers. 1 week later the shop is still worth more than it was before it frontpaged on reddit.

It does not matter what professional crackers have broken. It is just not feasible to try to crack what I proposed. Cost would be higher than gain.
The problem with brainwallets are that most of them use the same decryption process. If you add a simple additional step to the decryption that no one else is using it would make your wallet "not worth to crack".
The fact that thousands of people use the same way to generate wallet files (but using different passphrases) makes it worth it to try to crack some of them.
And really it does not matter if it's a professional cracker or not, you would still need to bruteforce the passphrase. The "reverse the text and then decrypt it"-part is something amateur crackers would be able to figure out... To get the private key you need to: bruteforce the password (AT THE CORRECT POSITION) + do some basic character shuffling (reverse the text) + use the correct decryption algo. 3 steps vs 1 step (passphrase WITHOUT correct position required).
The thing that makes it almost impossible to crack is that even if you get 2 steps right you won't even know that you got them right (thus the next bruteforce try will very likely not even get 1 step guessed correctly)
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:52:45
So you're gonna have code to monitor if an address has been used (what if 2 people send at the same time?) AND run a fucking cronjob.

Decided to check up if what i wrote is correct or not.
Seems like my guess was actually correct \o/
*When the output of a transaction is used as the input of another transaction, it must be spent in its entirety.*
So further theorycrafting: I'm guessing it would be possible to create a split transaction that takes all your money, split them multiple 1 satoshi transactions and send them to an address you own. If you do that you will never have to use a change address (because you now have several 1 satoshi transactions on your address and not 1 big transaction).
I'm not sure if this would cause loads of transaction fees or not though.

I think it's actually all the way to around two weeks ago. If you look after 19/10/2013 it extends approx half a bar, half a bar = 1½ month = early december'ish. The last 2 weeks would also be interesting though.
But yeah, price looks more stable at 2012 than 2013, the reason is probably because we've had 2 major crashes + a few "mini" crashhes whereas in 2012 nothing really happened.
Comparing 2011 to 2013 is more fair - 2011 had at least 1 major crash.
But yeah - volatility is a necessity in the early days of bitcoin for it to survive. It's looking like it's beginning to slow down a little though.

Probably the best suggestions. 500,000 satoshi = ~$1 right now.
If prices go &gt;$1000/BTC a change to satoshis are probably a good long term idea.
Maybe pair of 100 satoshi might be a good idea too. Aka 1 "whatever" = 100 satoshi. Then you get 2 decimals like a lot of other currencies have right now.

Yeah i understand that, we are using exchanges in different ways.
I'm merely a trader while you are cashing in/out.
Even a 2% fee isn't that big a problem if you are trying to cash in or out. However if you are trying to play the spread as a trader you will need much larger spreads to account for the fee.
Selling 10 bitcoins @ $149.99 and then buying them back at $150.00 might seem like a loss, but with a -0.1% fee you've actually earned $3.

What everyone is forgetting is how much acceptance it's gotten in the US and EU the last month. If the "true worth" was around $100 before the "bubble" it's probably around $400 now, doubt we'll ever go much lower than $200-300 again unless bitcoin just gets forgotten by everyone.
This weekend will be interesting.
Edit: reasoning taken from subpost:    
Yeah we haven't seen merchant acceptance quadruple, no large money has been injected into new bitcoin startups. Bitcoin ATM's hasn't started showing up here and there. Bitcoin did not frontpage several big magazines/newspapers. The value was over/around $100 before all of this happened. God this fucking anti-circlejerk-circlejerk is fucking annoying, why don't we say everyone stopped using bitcoins and it will go down to $0 tomorrow, it's inevitable and if you say otherwise youre just hoping for a get rich quick scheme.
Even if everyone in China completely drops bitcoin we "should" still be a little above $400, obviously not everyone in US/EU will hold while/if China completely sells out and thus we might go down to around $200-$300, and i DOUBT (still possible, only DOUBT) that we will go lower than that.

It's been much lower just a few days ago...
To bump the price from 70 to 100 usd you need 50k bitcoins, if this happens you will just see new walls forming because of more people wanting to sell out at this new higher price aka you will need another 50k to go from 100 to 150 a few hours later when the walls have been established.
Even if someone will instantly buy out all 68k bitcoins right now there will be new walls forming at around ~85-90usd for sure.
 shows pretty nicely what will happen (big selloff, but instantly goes back to regular price anyway)

It's already happened several times this week...
After the 2 25k BTC buys this week there was only around ~35k bitcoins left until "infinity price", but within hours there were already new walls at the higher prices bumping it up to around 70k bitcoins until infinity price.
It's just that people haven't set up their sell walls yet (because their bitcoins are in their wallets and not on the exchanges).
I think the mtgox EUR market was around 2-3k away from having all their ask walls gone a few days ago, now it needs 68k.

[Another site that accepts bitcoins](
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:03:35
I know - what i mean is that your text could have a random password in it and when that random password is added, the text is reversed and you apply some random algorithm on it, it would reveal the private key.
Even if you were to give out the random text nobody would ever find the private key.
How to do it backwards: generate a private key -&gt; run some random algo on it -&gt; reverse the output -&gt; remove 5 characters from the text and save those 5 characters (and their position) in your mind. Now even if somebody finds your text they won't be able to ever crack it anyway. It's basically the same thing as a shortened wallet file.

Well you could just go ahead and start a new country and not care if it does get recognized by any other country, the problem is that you will have to defend it against countries coming to claim (or reclaim if it was politically their land from the beginning) the land.
[This]( might be a short but pretty interesting read for you.
Afaik there is no single piece of unclaimed, livable, land. So to start your own country peacefully you would have to create your own island or get the blessing of a country when buying the land (which may or may not be impossible).

1. You did call it a malware. Also installing bitcoin won't suddenly make you more prone to malware, you just need to be more careful about not getting it in case you store the bitcoins on your computer.
2. You can buy a lot of things with bitcoin, of course there is a lot of things you cannot buy with it because not everyone knows of bitcoins. If everyone had your mindset there would be no reddit because once upon a time reddit had no users so why would you use reddit? To talk to yourself? Pfft. The first internet page? What a fucking waste that was.
3. Mybitcoin, bitcoinica, bitcoins s&amp;t, instawallet are not exchanges. A regular user should not have used any of those services for obvious reasons. Bitfloor got their bank account shut down but I guess that counts as bad security (if you have shit for brains). Same goes for DDoS, I don't think you understand the size of DDoS MtGox is getting. Liquidity is only a problem if you are trying to buy &gt;$10mil.
4. Regular uses who do not speculate or keep their funds somewhere stupid have a very little chance of getting "burned". I have never heard of a merchant getting burned.

Its during long declines (edit: not long declines, i was thinking fast ones, when the market is not very active it's no fun trading, takes too long to fill bids/asks) that making profit is the easiest. You just have to adapt a little depending on if it's trending up or down.
Going up? Use USD funds to put bids a cent above big wall, when someone take your bid you can easily ask for a higher price and get it filled almost instantly.
Going down? Use BTC funds to put asks a cent below big wall... -&gt; pretty much reverse the tactic used when going up.
You're either increasing your USD holdings or BTC holdings. The stress is not really worth it though haha.
Right now i just fill the ask/bid gap on btc-e fiat currency markets. Fluctuations almost never happen there so it's not very stresfull, easy money.

Please sell your bitcoins and buy them up for $5 cheaper, but NOT on mtgox. This ensures that more bitcoins go to people with brains..
Look at the order book on your exchange.
Does it look like bids get taken? If yes: try to sell for a few dollars above the highest bid (put yourself a cent under the biggest sell wall).
If you are lucky someone will buy your bitcoin; now put a bid a cent over the highest bid.
Congratulations: you just earned $10-50. (Good amount of bitcoins to do this with is ~2-10).
(It *might* be too late to do this today - mtgox looks to be coming back to a semi-uptrend right now, but during strong downtrends this is very easy to do)

I have never used bitstamp (I refuse to use big exchanges if they have fees for limit orders). btc24 offers 0% fees while bitfloor gives you money (0.1%) for limit orders.
But as I updates - the problem has been resolved but they don't seem to have given a reason why it happened to begin with. I may or may not have lost some potentional profit because of this freezing but ultimately I'm not mad about it since it's their exchange their rules, i knew this when I deposited.
I will continue using them anyway, since I the risk of losing the bitcoins I have there doesn't outweight the profit I make from trading with them.

The real money might have come from China (or it might just have been traded on chinese exchanges due to 0% fees) in the beginning but the real progression happened in US &amp; EU methinks, user&amp;merchant adoption has more than quadrupled even if we remove China from the equation.

It's accurate but it should be transaction volume measured in USD divided marketcap, not total transactions divided by marketcap. (chart would show a 2-3x growth this way, not a 16x decline).

It's always too late or too early.
You have a few options if you really want to buy in:
If it's a small amount of money:  
buy now or wait for a dip, no one knows if it will dip anytime soon or not, both are equally good options.
Large amount?  
Spread out your buys over a one/two year period.

@_date: 2013-11-22 20:32:27
Yes you're missing that it's likely just 25k bitcoins at most being traded back and forth. Not 150k bitcoins in solely one direction.
If someone sold 150k bitcoins at an instant evenly spread out on all exchanges it would bring the price down to around $120, however note that there would be a huge gap between bids and asks ($120 bids - ~$750 asks).

On active days i do around 25-35 trades. But the spread is usually not this high on active days so earnings are not close to that high per trade. I'm rarely trading actively though, just a fun thing to do every now and then (crashes).

You're selling and instantly buying back. You still have your 21.7 BTC but you only have $10k tax liability @ 30% ($19.6k profit - $9.6k loss)
If you hold your 20 BTC from $20 until $500 you are tax liable for $9600 @ 30% if you try to sell.
If you NEVER intend to cash out it might be advantageous to not trade because then you never actually have to pay the taxes. (unless you are trading without reporting your gains, easily done on almost any exchange since most of them don't require you to give your real name as long as you don't cash out to your bank - not sure whether it's technically illegal or not though)

@_date: 2013-03-23 02:01:55
Not really - it depends on if there are already someone selling for a lower price than you are looking to buy or if there is someone buying for a higher price than you are looking to sell.
Lets say someone puts a out a buy order for 70 usd, however the highest sell order is 70.1 usd. The person with the buy order will have to wait until someone who wants to sell bitcoins for exactly 70 usd or lower while the guy selling must wait for someone who wants to buy for 70.1 or higher. It's the person who already has an existing sell or buy order that gets all bitcoins at exactly the price they specified.
If you want to sell all your bitcoins instantly for "whatever the highest price is" you would typically put in that you want to sell all your bitcoins at "0" price, it will then look for the highest existing buy orders and go through them until you are out of bitcoins. If you are looking to instantly buy bitcoins for all your dollars you can for example put in that you want to buy bitcoins for 100 usd each, this will use all your money to buy bitcoins from the people who have existing sell orders for the lowest price out.
Simply looking at bids/asks on [this page]( might help you understand exactly how it works.

I think you only have to wait for 1 confirmation before it's very likely that it's your money if you have no reason to think someone is trying to cheat you. 2 confirmations and you are almost guaranteed that it is a legitimate transactions, more confirmations after that will only give you a tiny bit more security. 6 confirmations are recommended to be completely sure that it was a legit confirmation unless something is seriously wrong with the blockchain (like the fork a week or two ago).

Oh, but it is a monstrous server side code, the website actually has to connect to a wallet and generate a new address all the time. Not only is it monstrous code it is also resource heavy.
Are you saying online merchant sites do not require monstrous code relative to a simple text page?
In the end I kind of support the change - as long as it only delays transactions to the same address by a few blocks. If you are receiving bitcoins to a public address odds are you don't need the transaction to be very quick (you passively received bitcoins).

Because liquidity. You will have a very hard time selling @ $175.99 because no one will take you up on the offer for many hours (and people will undercut you before it will happen).
It is sometimes possible to buy bitcoins at ridiculously low or high prices on smaller exchanges if you are patient.
For example a Swedish exchange called Kapiton had a high of 1100 SEK aka 170 USD while mtgox were around the 120 USD mark and dropping.
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:28:55
low = trade with the lowest price last 24hrs
high = trade with the highest price last 24hrs
last price = the price of the last trade
weighted average = ~~Basically the average "last price" of all trades during the last 24 hrs. Really it's a bit more complicated than that though - example: there has been 2 trades the last 24hrs; 1 trade that was 10 bitcoins for 10usd each and one that was 1 bitcoin for 9usd, weighted average will be = (10 * 10 + 1 * 9) / 11=9.909~~

Did google, apple or microsoft actually take out any loans to start up?

Sadly you cannot make up your own laws by purchasing an island. Although it would probably be pretty easy to hide small time illegalities.

Or when there are enough speculators to drive the price high enough.
I believe infrastructure will slowly lag behind market price in bitcoins case. Very hard to say anything for sure but looking at the last 2 months this seem to be the case.

I believe it is a php/mysql combo. I'm also guessing the trades are handled in a very resource intensive way. MtGox claim 10gbps+ traffic, yet their exchange can barely handle 3+ market orders per second.

Mindset needs to be "I want to earn more money" when trading short term, not "I don't want to lose any more money!".

OP's suggestions is better.
Don't try to sell the concept of bitcoin, better to just tell them you want the option to buy with bitcoin... Let them research it for themselves..

Indeed, not sure why he wants the BTC symbol instead but I only answered why he doesn't have it :)

They are not in hold anymore for those who is wondering (not sure why they were in hold to begin with but there is a BitFloor notification about it that doesn't really say why they were held to start with, maybe hit a threshold)

HDD's 10 years ago were ~10x more expensive than today.
Going by that logic it's still ~$40 per day in SSD storage to do 20k tps to run a full bitcoin node in 2024.
$4 by 2034.

Manually change the fee to 0.00005.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:07:59
That's pretty strange.
Since I'm not sure how to help you i suggest you make a post @  (or try this subreddit, it has very high traffic right now so your post might get buried here though), it might be possible to invalidate that transaction and resend with a fee but I have no idea. If you just let it be it will likely go through sooner or later however, my highly speculative guess would be around 20-30 hours but I might be way off.

2nd password hides 50% (or any other number) of all your highest value addresses. This way it will still look like a pretty legit wallet that has valid, recent transactions.
edit: Didn't read the comment you responded to too closely at first - so this post is not really directed towards what you said, but i will leave it here anyway :P

Normally you use a wallet file to store bitcoins in (the file kind of acts like a really long password).
You used a brain wallet - you probably either used a very short password or a sentence, these are very easily cracked.

Daytrading is definitely not like flipping a coin. Even pretty simple bots can make easy profits on some of the BTC exchanges as it is now.
eg: i have around 2.5k trades on btc-e, ~2400 of them have been 0.2-2% profitable while 100 has been 0.2-2% unprofitable. If you plug that data into a calculator you will see that even if there are 99 trillion people flipping 2500 coins once every second for 100 000 years the likelyhood of someone actually getting those stats are [7.44*10^-546](
How do you explain that? (In reality my stats are a little better than that but whatever + any time i "lose" it's likely because of fees..) Daytrading does not exclusively mean guessing highs and lows..

Umm, they would just do it and if you don't follow their rules you are breaking the law? Just like with anything else.

Yeah, failing to see that not even 10% of all bitcoin are up for sale is a pretty huge blunder and doesn't even deserve any discussion.

To instantly dump the price down to $25 someone would have to sell 125k bitcoins aka $13mil.
Ofcourse the market would rebound to some middleground if that happens though, probably around $75 or so, pure speculation.

Yeah, some btc &amp; cash withdrawals seem to have gone through for some people the last month so it doesn't seem like kapiton is out to really scam people, it's very possible that they somehow lost part of their money though. Having solely technical problems for 1½ month is not very believable, it's been long enough that one could even create a new exchange from scratch and sites rarely just break like that.
My money is on big backlog + owner of kapiton unable to deal with it all, i would probably also get very distant if i was in his position. Imagine you have a big mob of people waiting for their money and you cannot get it out quick enough, morale = 0, time to hibernate through the Swedish winter and pray for better times.

Even if the coins are 4 years old you would need at least 92k coins.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:45:20
Do you have to be verified to be able to sell bitcoins?
I thought it was just to be able to withdraw &amp; deposit fiat.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:41:16
No they wouldn't because they wouldn't have let it happen in the first place with the ridiculous 70 minute lag. All of them worked fairly good today (&lt;10sec lag). Most exchanges went down for 2-3 minutes 2 times today, mtgox had a constant 30 minute+ lag.
Also MtGox "only" did around 50-55% of all trades today.

I don't see any events similar to burning man that has thought about it yet. It's honestly not that surprising that they hadn't considered it yet, it might have been a little surprising if they had never heard of bitcoin but it seems like they had.
