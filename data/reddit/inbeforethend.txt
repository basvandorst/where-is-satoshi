Uh, so just wait until Monday?

This reeks of insecure, volatile human, no business in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:48:14
If this applies to you, get out of bitcoin, you're not cut for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:13:34

Big ups on your big day, big guy!

Let's not use the word "retarded" to describe asinine things we don't agree with. There exists better words to voice our displeasure while maintaining an aura of intelligence. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:51:18
Gosh, if only it was that easy to get tips when I posted questions :(
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:33:10
So here's a solution but all you can say is "thank you"? So the coins are going to go unused/untouched..
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:32:52
And you stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:31:43
If he doesn't plea, the prosecutors get an even bigger win. There's no light at the end of that tunnel. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:27:28
And OP uses the: "English not first language defense" &amp; also doesn't bother to respond to you. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:36:02
The incompetence at Newegg is outstanding. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:38:30
4 hours later and no response.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:07:58
OP posted in another thread 19 minutes ago. You stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:37:35

Swedes are so docile, what would have even do if he found him? 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:06:52
As someone who just bought two S3's..dang it.
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:35:03
Regardless, it seems a representative from the site has even reached out to you directly. His statement even goes to reduce the worry you have. Oh well, my time is done here.
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:41:47
Internet is serious business folks.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:03:49
This breaks a core rule of reddit and should be reported &amp; the user banned.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:56:49
I still don't think bitcoin is really ideal for younger folk. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:30:27
I'm sorry, can I please be my own charity?
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:31:07
Probably best to delete the post and resubmit. Self promotion is also a big no no.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:46:28
At least 7.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:02:33
Civilised AF.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:30:01
Fuck @_date: 2015-11-06 17:44:20
I'd do it.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:51:53
$20k on a bet that had no guarantee whatsoever to pay off? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:31:50
Shame on you.
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:52:10
Trillions 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:09:07
Hey thanks, please let me know if anything comes up!
@_date: 2015-11-18 02:21:41
Way late to the party bro 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:49:35
How come my iOS mycelium can't sync?
Edit: I'm sorry, but I'm just spooked because I keep getting a "can't synchronize, please try again later", error.
