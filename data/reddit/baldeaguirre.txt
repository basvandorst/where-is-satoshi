@_date: 2019-11-26 17:48:51

@_date: 2018-10-16 00:31:29
someone's getting a Lambo and plenty of hookers soon..
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:46:24
we are not at the bottom.. just look at the charts.
@_date: 2018-10-12 22:17:11
I'm from Mexico, can I make withdrawals using this platform?..
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:49:08
No one will get lambos after all.. BTC was a huge scam.. if I only invest that much money.
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:06:35
money laundry.
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:25:51
Stop leaving the sink open.
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:58:02
you look super nerd.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:43:39
$5K - $10K USD..  seems the normal fluctuations rates for BTC price after it overpass those levels the price becomes uneatable.. at least is what historical charts shows... correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:08:30
I want to buy some crypto..
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:14:24
Coinbase sucks Central Banks ass.

skyrocketing to the Moon.. this how it should be done!!
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:35:21
The year is over... buy low.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:32:38
Bitcoin is the present.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:02:41
It's a scam.
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:18:06
when the price is right for you just tell them who are the idiots now...
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:08:52
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:03:36
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:08:46
I hope the price will reach $5,000 USD soon ����
@_date: 2019-02-16 00:41:42
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:52:15
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:37:23
They do.
@_date: 2019-12-08 20:09:49
lol, this is me..
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:54:22
Invest in Bitcoin then don't give a shit about the price for at least a couple of years then see the dividends..
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:40:54
seems like malware to me.. lol ��
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:35:41
It's definitely not going to happen.. at least for the moment..
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:00:22
are you telling me that by 2023 BTC price at its worst will be above the $10K?.. damn... I knew I was late and buying BTC early this year was a bad decision.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:19:38
lol. ������
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:49:19
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:46:35
no shit..
@_date: 2019-01-01 03:23:16
Congrats, I'm still going for the lambo though.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:51:37
doesn't seem legit to me.. right now $4,000 seem more probably than reaching $13,000 USD.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:17:44
RIP bitcoin.. long live to BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-01 21:43:58
that's why I sold all my altcoins.. ETH &amp; XRP..
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:34:42
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:05:41
I'm planning to buy some crypto as a way of investment if the price goes down again.. which cryptocurrency would you recommend me to buy BTC or ETH?..
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:45:46
BTC is not for exchanging.. is for investing trough several years in a row; that were the mistakes you were making in those 8 months.
Never sell BTC, only buy when the price is low and don't sell no matter how low is the price, BTC is not going anywhere and the price is expected to rise in the following years; hope you take my advice, otherwise you will be losing money by buying and selling just like in a Casino.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:30:52
It will go up and higher! ��
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:55:53
LOL.. HODL!!
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:12:18
buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:04:47
this is why bitcoin shouldn't be used by stupid people.
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:46:20
You could wait a little more; BTC price is still supposed to go lower before the price start to rise again.. it's still two years before BTC start to see earnings again.
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:28:40
buy Bitcoin if you want to buy lambos!
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:29:26
We should wait a couple of years until the price rise again..
