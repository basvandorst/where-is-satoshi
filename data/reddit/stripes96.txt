I don't know what the transaction times are like for LTC, but yes this is called arbitrage. The issue is that by the time the LTC confirms and appears in your second account, you might have lost your margin. Again, depends very much on the LTC transaction time, as I've only seen this referenced RE: bitcoin vs fiat.

No hard feelings, not in the mood for a heavy Internet argument - too much to do! Merry Christmas :)

Sorry, should have made it clear that the analogy was hypothetical

this is becoming a farce...
EDIT: well that had my palms sweaty...

How can somebody so clueless be paid to talk about something they clearly know so little about?

Surely the method by which you lose value is irrelevant? Value was lost. Period. Not saying that it wasn't one's own fault. Merely saying that potential gains were lost.
Edit: you mention time lost. So if I value my time at $300/hr, and spend an hour setting up a coinbase account and ledger nano s, etc etc. Buy my coins, and then sell for $150 profit. That also means I've lost money then? No - only if by spending the time doing that I passed up the opportunity to earn $300, which is only the case if I turned down work.

Ah. I just reread my comment and see that I wrote "they cost me money" - my mistake. That was an error and not what I mean. I should probably learn to read properly or something.

Just because I didn't sell my coins at a loss, doesn't mean that I didn't lose money. I could have sold my coins yesterday for 50% more. Just because I didn't cash out and rebuy at that price doesn't mean they didn't cost me 50% more return.

If you'd read my other comment, you'd see that I retracted my comment about it being their fault. My apologies for not making that clearer to you.
Edit: from your post history I see you're a trump supporter. Now I understand your moronic delivery of what was actually a fair point

OK: an analogy. I mined a load of bitcoin in a country where the electricity is free. I borrowed the hardware from my brother for free. It cost me nothing to mine the (let's say) 0.5 bitcoin i have. Then it gets stolen. But i don't mind because it cost me nothing so I haven't lost anything anyway /s

Serious question; so we saw the crazy rise to $19k, then the crash, and now it's back on the up again... are 35% rises in a single day ever sustainable? Is this just the entire "mini bubble" happening again? Surely this kind of growth isn't sustainable?

I'd be satisfied with 500k... Then I won't have a student loan ��
