What are you referring to with him coming out of hiding?

You can't make wild untrue proposals. If they aren't fufilled this actually looks really bad on the community in general. Instead, reach out with a suggestion to accept a service such as Bitpay for as low as $30 a month. Then they can accept money from the community without even having to worry about the volatility of the market as they can choose to have it instantly converted to cash as they accept payment.
It's also against reddiquette to post something as personal as someone's email address on here. Did you get her permission to do this? Your heart is in the right place, but you really are overextending your boundaries with what you should be doing to get more people involved in Bitcoin.
**Edit**: It's not just against reddiquette to post someone's personal information against their will. It's against the rules of reddit. I reported this to the mods but maybe if you take that off nothing will come of it. You could inadvertently be creating a witchhunt for trolls and such to flame her inbox.

Thanks! I missed that the first time around. Interesting.

Whatever the default is, there should be an option to alter it to your own personal preferences. Mycelium defaults to mBits and I had to adjust it to Bitcoin simply because that's what I've grown to make sense of.

Now that he had to sell that, he can at least use Lyft.
