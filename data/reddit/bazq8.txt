Well in Kuwait electicity is probably the cheapest in the world and also almost free.  Anyone want to do a project? ��
Edit: people complaining about it being hot here...yes it is. In the summer it gets around 58° C  but to counter that every single place is air-conditioned. And I'm not talking about European air conditioning....I'm talking freezing cold if you want it.

Well, I am pretty disappointed with coinbase.  They actually lost me money because it took 3 to 4 days to transfer the bitcoins I had purchased and they wouldn't allow me to sell them when I wanted to which was a day before the crash.  I should have been making a 50% profit and now have a huge loss.

OK, I have a question.  I heard somewhere that the market cap is 20 million bitcoins? that means its finite amount and not everyone will be able to own bitcoins, thus limiting its use to the world population? SORRY I'm a newby just trying to get my head around this new concept.

So why are these crazy price drops and jumps happening right now while for the most part it has been stable?

Ya but dont forget to factor in electricity costs.  Outside the US you pay little to nothing for electricity depending on where you live.  [Electricity costs]( will also eat up profits once the difficulty gets higher, try organizing the list by price to see the best locations for running miners.
