Morality is 100% subjective. To claim otherwise is incredible ignorant. It's a set of rules a society creates collectively, which change over time. I feel like there's a lot of teenagers in this thread beating off while watching V for Vendetta.
You're not freedom warriors kids.

You're responding to a comment that identifies this as a BitPay problem.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:07:44
Did you read the statements?
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:06:36
I have no idea what that's supposed to mean.

Still not a Ponzi scheme.

Jesus fucking christ this subreddit is full of idiots.

It's just called Bitcoin Wallet. By 'Bitcoin Wallet developers.' I think it's a pretty standard choice. I have a couple bitcoin-wallet-keys-[date] files on my internal storage but frankly I don't know if that's what I'm looking for.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:56:09
How could it be a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:26:20
None of what you just typed changes the fact that it appears that he clearly and knowingly broke the law.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:36:26
You have got to be some kind of parody account.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:43:32
Thanks trollbox.
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:42:28
Taking the battery out allowed it to load. Thanks so much! I'm going to learn what the fuck I'm doing now...
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:00:35
None of those things make it a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:26:24
Who decides what's correct? Not you.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:25:57
You would say a lot of things, because you aren't thinking.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:52:52
Give it a rest.

If he's not an idiot he's doing a pretty good impression of one.

Note what this comment is really illustrating though. This is a problem primarily with customer support, which you'll find at any large retailer, not specifically with Bitcoin. Naturally Bitcoin exacerbates the issue but I wouldn't characterize this is a "BitCoin horror story."
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:59:15


No, it's not.

Recognizing that knowingly assisting in tax evasion and money laundering is a crime does not make one a government shill.

Ponzi schemes are false investment opportunities with wildly inflated rates of return. MtGox does not have the characteristic of a Ponzi scheme.

You don't have ideas. You have an empty space with a snarl tacked on. It's like watching a toddler try to formulate a political opinion while simultaneously being turned down for prom.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:50:17
Society does. Because there's no objective set of rules for what is "moral." "Morality" is a human invention.

Nice clean interface. Minimal latency. This type of service is desperately needed. I would just recommend making it clearer how to submit a merchant into your index.

It appears he gave advice on how to get around the law.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:29:03
No, it's not.

Coinbase has two primary focuses. One is allowing individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin through bank transfers. The other is to provide merchants a way to accept Bitcoin, which is BitPay's sole focus.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:19:35
It doesn't really need a special name, it's either a massive fuck up or an amateurish theft. A Ponzi scheme would imply some level of sophistication.
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:33:37
Well this is embarrassing.

Price at time of purchase, which I would expect had I actually completed the purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:03:05
 A popup appeared. It said the transaction would take four business days. It had an "ok" and a "cancel" button. I clicked cancel. The transaction *never completed*.  Coinbase took the money anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:34:15
 I cancelled  because I  didn't want to wait four business  days and the Coinbase  code presented  me with a cancel button. I  very much doubt you put much thought into your condescending bullshit  response. GFY.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:46:47
Uh, I'm upset that a company I was doing business with took my money when I canceled a transaction. Do you think that's unreasonable? What's your point?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:49:18
You get what? I searched and all the threads were about not receiving their Bitcoin. This is an entirely different issue.
