I tried to mine coin back in the day. I'm a pretty smart guy but I couldn't figure it out. I didn't want to be part of a pool of miners because I have trust issues. There were some stories about people just taking the coins mined by the pool. I never figured out how to mine and gave up on bitcoin after Mt gox got hacked.
I'm still learning about bitcoin. It's hard to get into it if you don't have an understanding of how it works. I don't want a program to just do it for me without understanding what that program is doing.

Someone puts up like 920 bitcoin for sale at 17250. People well sell lower to get in front of the wall. It can sometimes start a waterfall effect downward because people think that's the top.
The person can take down the wall and buy up the people that sold.
I have seen walls eaten before so it can happen. Someone buys the lot and people jump on the buy train so the price goes up.

To cash out you have to go though an exchange. I'm pretty sure the exchange can lock up or just limit thouse cashing out. Sorry guys our sever is locking up and going down for maintenance. For you to cash out you also need a buyer. If no one is buying then it's worth nothing already.

14.29% if you bought at 17.5k and sold at 20k. Then take a small amount from that for any fees/taxes.
Dealing with an exchange to make the purchase may take time. Getting your money in and out will take time as well.

Bitcoin can't support the network load. Miners loving the extra fees so why change?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:50:30
Then entire pools switch over when mining a diffrent coin is more profitable. When the fees start piling up they just switch back to rake in the profit. Is that right?

"Shoot for the moon. If you miss your frozen corpse will be a monument to your failure." Taken from a comic I seen pop up on reddit. Every time I hear "to the moon!" I think of this.
People that were obsessing over silver during the rise said the same thing. Maybe one day silver will be $40-$60 per oz but it definitely didn't turn out like people thought. I'm not saying bitcoin is going to be the same or diffrent. Just hedge your risk instead of loading the boat and praying.

Bitcoin is a great concept. I just hope banks and governments don't ruin it. If your trying to get rich quick then don't risk more than you can afford.

How much was the fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:32:04
People mine bitcoin by solving a puzzle. If you solve the puzzle you are awarded bitcoins and a block to fill with transactions of your choosing. You also receive any fees of the transactions added to the block. To make it profitable people take the transactions with the largest fees.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:58:47
You're not alone there. Maybe a hand full of people even know about bitcoin in my town. Most of them could care less about it. Cryto has some work before it becomes appealing to less techy people or even just less of a hassle. Good chance to get in semi-early and see where it goes.

On coinbase, last time I tried to transfer, it was $4+ usd. That seems kinda high. Is that because coinbase is setting that fee? Is there a way I can lower the fee if I don't care how long it takes?
Any speculation on what fees will be when most of the coins have been mined?
I read somewhere that fees are high due to the amount of transactions going on right now. If it's crazy now wouldn't it be super high later if a majority of people are doing daily transactions to purchase goods?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:40:50
I can buy on coinbase at 6% using a cc and get 2% back in points. I don't know anyone in real life that owns bitcoins. This is the cheapest way I found. Maybe they charge less for bank transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:07
I sold most at 13 but played the market on the way down. Lost 16% of my investment including fees. I think it was a cheap price to pay just to be apart of what happens in a panic.

It probably doesn't help with csi like tv shows where people are asking for bitcoin and not usd as ransom. I'm sure criminals have used bitcoin to move currency. It's not the only outlet for laundering or moving money though. At least it's transparent. I don't know why any citizen would be against net neutrality unless they own an isp.

I don't know what gdxp is. Average fee for bitcoin tx is $20-$30. You can go lower if your willing to wait though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:31:34
Not just the fees but they mark up the price by $200 when buying and lower the price by $200 when selling. Convince percentage? I don't mind the fees but would like to buy at your own market price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:10:48
If your worried now then how would you feel if it dipped to 10k? If that is stressful then I would sell some. No point in having a heart attack over bitcoin.

I tried to buy $10 worth of bitcoin today just to play around with it. Holy crap. I  registered at coinbase and had no clue they needed a copy of my DL. So they have all my bank account info along with my drivers licence. Pretty scary thinking about identity theft. I gave up after trying to get my ID verified for the last couple of hours. I thought it would a lot easier.

Why would banks want to borrow money for a day with interest? How does this benefit the borrowers?

Just between you and me, you don't believe it, do you? You don't believe this Bitcoin is the One?

Not sure. It was in 2018. Looks like a few min apart. Did you keep clicking something? I never used that wallet before. Why did you send money to yourself? Is that your wallets address?
Thats about $100 in btc with $91 in fees
