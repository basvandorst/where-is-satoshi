'there are tax consequences'
yeah-  like there are even more ways to write down or ignore the value of it and not necessarily have to pay tax on it.  What a moron

I work in the markets and as such, charting is like 7th nature to me at this point, so-  assuming his was referencing simple BRK, it just hit a new high only like 2 days ago (highest in 3 years) and the 50SMA just crossed the 200SMA.. top to bottom, the opposite of a golden cross.  So a pretty easy bet to make.
That's just on a quick technical glance, no clue what ol' warren's up to, so who knows maybe it's sustainable.  But the market thinks not.

How quick the moronic american consumer is to forget.
You fucks do recall that Paypal *voluntarily* suspended payments to:
- support groups for Julian Assange
- support groups for Occupy Wall St.
- Anonymous
among others of the like.   
And a company that enthusiastically does this... goes ??well?? with the fundamental concept of BTC?
How fucking stupid are you people who think this is a good thing?

I guess you're a moron too who knows nothing of GAAP or other auditing/accounting standards.
Not knowing doesn't make you a moron; making proclamations on a subject you know you know nothing about makes you a moron.

.... lets not go overboard folks.. when people get a bit too 'ambitious' i'll say with these ideas, makes it too easy to disparage the entire BTC ecosystem.
Maybe just stick to widescale adoption of btc in general, and let the users/consumers decide where we all want it.

what is bitlicense?
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:07:21
ya.   Just saw your comment, and those facts underlie what I said a couple days ago.   
-not going anywhere-
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:06:28
yep.  and same as the OTC market.

thanks-  i genuinely didn't know.
On reading your description, my knee-jerk is that this would strike at the heart of what bitcoin is;  as soon as someone needs a license, there needs to be an agency, with criteria, which they must apply to.  As soon as some entity holds that power to say yes or no, the balance of what bitcoin is (as in having no such centralized-anything) would be massively skewed.
edit, and upon just skimming the article.. yeah.  fuck that.  I don't even own any btc, but am interested in it and love the concept-  and i say the beginning of the end will be marked as soon as one such regulation as is proposed is allowed to go into effect.

... as someone who works with and directly in the securities industry (and &lt;3's BTC btw) i have to say that they're not going anywhere.  
It will take nothing less than a complete dissolution of our entire world's entire electronic infrastructure to see that happen.   Not the introduction of BTC and other crypto's into the mix.
