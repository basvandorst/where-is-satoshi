They know the merchant ID of the exchange you're changing fiat into crypto at, so my advice is to just avoid the topic of where you're sending your hard earned money and instead contemplate the ridiculousness of a bank having any right to know what you're doing with your money.
Great ad for Bitcoin, really.

That's fantastic!

Is Bitcoin less efficient in its energy use than the banking system? Recall that banks own office buildings to house their centralized services. Often these buildings are in metropolitan areas where the employees must commute through rush hour. 
Conversely, Bitcoin is mined where electricity is cheap - often near hydroelectric dams or other renewable energy sources.
It's worth noting as well that large mining operations work closely with their local utilities during times of power surge or limitations. The power grid relies on corporate partners to help load balance the energy network.

What could possibly go wrong?
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:45:22
You bring up a really good point, and thankfully it's one that history has already solved.
Crypto gives people the power to be their own banks, but doing so is a choice that as you point out, many don't want to make.
There is a place for banks in crypto, to offer many of the same services that they offer now like banking (custody) and loans. 
A problem in the banking industry that crypto strives to solve is the manipulation of monetary policy done by the central banks.

I consider Bitcoin the global reserve currency against which I would trade any number of assets including equities, commodities, currencies, and really anything else.
Vivat Rex Bitcoin!

I'm into freedom and liberty. 
I have not seen a politician who has the bests interests of the people ahead of their own.
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:09:01
I agree, the free market needs to make the call. 
I'm no fan of BSV, but the focus should be on educating others about what a scam looks like, and acts like, and smells like.
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:31:28
It's pretty direct, to be honest.

Perhaps, but if the clients don't own the private key, that makes ownership questionable

People use cryptocurrencies because they are the third evolution in accounting - solving the problem of trust. 
First evolution was the concept of writing down your transactions. I bought 2 cows for 30 bushels of hay. Civilizations were built on the back of the idea of record keeping. 
Second evolution was the idea of two people writing down the same transactions; debits and credits. And so born was the industrial revolution. I bought 2 cows for 30 bushels of hay, and you bought 30 bushels of hay for 2 cows. 
Still though, if I only received 20 bushels of hay, and you changed your record of the transaction to say that I paid 2 cows for 20 bushels of hay, then it's a he-said-she-said argument for the courts to settle. 
With crypto, I can sell you two cows for 30 bushels of hay where you and I both write down that transaction, agree to it, and every other person on the blockchain works together to defend that record from ever changing. I no longer have to trust that the other person isn't going to change the books and fight the validity of the transaction because it's written in stone (block). 
What kinds of unimaginable advances in civilization and society will be predicated on the idea of reducing the cost of doing business with strangers by eliminating the risk of needing to trust them?

Indeed, especially when you read that there was no written agreement between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital despite Bitfinex holding over a billion dollars in that account...
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:04:54
There's truth to that. Most established banks don't want to deal with the headache of remittance for a crypto exchange. Ironically that is great advertisement for crypto, but in the meantime the industry will continue to struggle. The Office of the Attorney General specifically listed Bitfinex's many troubled banking relationships as a roadblock for the industry.

Or buy Bitcoin :p
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:08:37
You are correct when you say the current legal framework is not sufficient to provide clarity in how to report crypto taxes. 
My suggestion is to first consult with a CPA, and ask them what options you have including filing for extensions until the alphabet soup government agencies all get their ducks in a row.

OG players have definitely been gobbling up the sub 5k prices. Some of the biggest wallets have been buying at these prices.

Frame your question in terms of % return on investment. 
Use that to establish what your risk to reward tolerance is. 
Build a plan with that information. 
George believes that Bitcoin could double in price from 5,200 to 10,400. ROI would be 100%
George believes that Bat could go from $0.44 to $0.88. ROI would also be 100%. 
I know you're only investing $25 and are probably willing to risk it all, but for the sake of the example let's say George is only willing to risk half of that. If things go sour, George wants to make sure he can at least get $12.50 back. 
Risk is 50%, Reward is 100%. 
With that information, George can now decide between buying BTC at $5,200 and selling at either $2,600 or $10,400 - whichever comes first, or buying BAT at $0.44 to sell at either $0.22 or $0.88.
To decide which to go with, you need to plug in the numbers that make sense for you. Where do you think BTC can increase in price to? What about BAT? At what point does it become clear that your plan isn't going to work out? What is the % risk for that price?

Seeing a list like that gives you some perspective.
Also the name Orbitcoin is pretty funny

Day trading is not easy, but it is simple.
Buy low sell high is simple, but how do you know what is low and what is high?
There are hundreds if not thousands of people out there that draw pretty lines on charts and pretend they know anything whatsoever about how markets moves. Hah. 
I aim to make at least 1%-3% ROI per day trading, and I do so using algorithmic depth chart micro analysis. That's a fancy way of saying that I measure how the depth chart moves and can use that to determine with startling accuracy how price is expected to move in short time frames.
The power of compound interest means that I'm pulling 20% ROI per week, and as I grow my BTC stack I use the same basic strategy on Bitmex for nearly limitless liquidity.
If you want to experience profitable day trading, my advice is to start with the basics.
Here is a free, no strings attached, webinar that you can use to get an idea of how it all works.

Of course I can lose a trade. I employ stop losses so that I cut my bleeders before they do any real damage. 
Here's some fun example trading math for you: 
**If my profit target is 4% and my stop loss is 1%, paying Binance fees at 0.075%, then I only need to be right 40.57% of the time to net an average of 1% profit, compounding excluded.** 
The algorithm is not right 100% of the time, nothing in trading is. The algo is based off probabilities, and has a base success rate of upwards of 70%. Through the use of the algo I can make my trades in ways that are statistically smart. The risk versus the reward makes sense. Couple that with skills and techniques that I've learned through trading with the Voodoo Crypto community, all of a sudden the profitability skyrockets. 
Does it sound fanciful? You bet it does. Does the math check out? Why yes, it does. Am I incredibly excited about my financial stability and future trading full time? Absolutely! 
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:01:19
Return on investment doesn't necessarily mean I reinvest all of my profits into the next trade, or that I trade with my entire stack for every trade. I generally stash aside 30% of a trade's profits into BTC cold storage that I'm saving for my great-grandchildren. 
And "free webinar" is just that - a free webinar to share our strategy and promote our community. There is no form to input credit card information, there are no requirement to purchase anything, no commitment necessary of any kind. 
At the end of the webinar there is an opportunity to spend real money investing in yourself with an education course, access to the algorithm, alerts, live chats with other traders, ya-dee-ya-ya. The decision to make that purchase is entirely up to you, nobody else.

Bitcoin is a risky asset to most people. When shit is hitting the fan, people tend to offload risk.
That said, Bitcoin was born from the ashes of the last financial crisis. Nobody knows how it will react to the next one.
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:38:40
You make a strong point that a currency needs a reference currency, but don't bring up that Bitcoin is already doing just that - trading against other currencies. 
When bitcoin trades against USD or EUR or any other Central banks currency, I'd argue that the competitive coin you're talking about bitcoin needing is really stable coins. Ultimately the Fed should create their own stable coin and allow people to pay taxes with it. Unfortunately, that would expose the Fed to having to talk about how the issue new coins...
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:15:44
Analysis of Bitcoin can broadly be described as technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis.
**Technical** analysis is the study of market behaviors, attributing probabilities to outcomes of specific patterns.
**Fundamental** analysis dives into the utility that Bitcoin provides.










Then you can also do meta analysis on how the users are using it over time, what are the behaviors of different types of wallets.
**Sentiment** analysis is based on how people collectively perceive the asset. Are people FOMOing like crazy or panic selling? Analytically this is represented by the order books, the depth chart, and how it reacts to changes.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:55:21
Some will view it that way, sure. Some will view it as just the opposite. I just don't have enough data to predict which will be the stronger force. Bitcoin has never witnessed a financial crisis, these next few months/years will be very interesting.

You can never know what price is going to do, but you can understand risk versus reward and put yourself in positions where the probabilities work in your favor.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:50:21
The risk of doing business with an entity as shady as Bitfinex can be calculated out to an exact premium you're willing to stomach. Different traders will stomach different premiums and the market decides at what price it's collectively worth it.

As an avid trader I've loved this volatility and have made good money doing it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:12:42
My day trading strategy requires a few hours of focus per day, make a few percent, call it good. With volatility like this, I might spend 8 hours a day trading, but that's because I love doing it not because I have to.
