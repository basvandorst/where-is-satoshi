You might be right I just found this map 
but if I buy a BITCOIN made in china it could be lower?

That is good advice but isn't Crypto Currency the safest of all? It can not be burned down like a house or stolen by the government, property taxes. Physical gold can be stolen or confiscated like it was before. And it is hard to move if I have alot of it.

Yes I am informed but that was back when BITCOIN was sold on some mickey-mouse playing card website and not what we have today!

Wouldn't that be a good idea for a new Crypto-coin, one that is stable forever at a value everyone agrees on when it is first created? With technology today it is possible I think.

Ok Thank You
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:06:12
How can we make BITCOIN stay the same value, or is there another coin I should look at that we buyers can all agree to stay the same value? Thank you.

I have one more question, if someone steals my crypto-currency by force, won't the theft be recorded in the block-chain and wherever it ends up will be known by all? Thank you.

But WHY would it ever drop or go up? In my eyes it is like we are all putting our FIAT paper in before the government can mess it up, but we will always know forever that I put in 5 thousand  2017 "dollars" worth of value. So, it does not matter what the price of one BITCOIN is right now when I buy it. Lets say that right now one candy bar cost one dollar, I buy 5 thousand "dollars" worth of BITCOIN today, I should be able to buy 5 thousand candy bars next year because the cashier will know that is what I put in. That is the beauty of the whole thing.

I want to buy 4 coins for One Thousand Dollars each but it has not reached that point all night so I am going to bed. Good night.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:03:58
Okay but if the price goes up after I buy, my coins will buy more goods later then they would right now, and that does not really make much sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:13:14
Yes it might start out slow but when people see the truth about FIAT money they will be quick to switch. You don't think BITCOIN will become top currency?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:29:03
Well what if they stopped mining any new BITCOIN right now, the value would be locked in at this price right now. No de-flation or in-flation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:12:59
If the thief was caught and confessed to stealing a bitcoin, on a video to prove to the internet that the bitcoin was stolen, could the coin be 'blacklisted' from the block-chain somehow? Or returned to me first. That seems like it would be a good feature.

Well in my idea, the total amount of coins in existence could never change so the value of each coin would never change. If there is one million coins total then each coin is worth one millionth of the economy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:11:02
That makes sense because government keeps printing more paper and de-value the dollar. BITCOIN should not have that problem?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:00:04
Why do people say 'comfortable with losing' when Crypto Currency is the safest way in history to store value, can not be copied or faked or hacked. Or controlled by government. It is math.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:23:15
I am not trying to make money, I am trying to protect the money I already have. I do not want the price to go up or down AT ALL. What crypto-currency is available that will never change? There is so many. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:56
I don't think so now, for some reason it don't seem to go below 13 thousand which is way too much.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:36:04
Almost $200 a month, that is absurd.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:03:13
What are the taxes like?
