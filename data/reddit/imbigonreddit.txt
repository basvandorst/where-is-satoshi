Sounds like customer support reassuring and anxious customer.
Remember that this is a forum and not necessarily news. And please don't say anything about buying on the rumor… We all know the cliché goes.

I've got to admit, I spent a few seconds waiting for it to tick off one Satoshi and then decided, nah, that's just silly and then spent a few seconds more.

Deep web: Websites not indexed by Google like the internal payroll section in a car dealership.
*Not to be confused with…*
Dark web: A smaller subset of the deep web that needs special routing software like ToR to access.

You don't realize how much work that would be even for a team of mods. It's the subscriber's job to downvote and report spam accounts.

We already have a reputation for 'hounding' retailers to except Bitcoin payment. I don't like being not welcome because we're pushy.

Unfortunately for many of us in the US, yes, this would be very bad on your computer at work. And I hate it when someone has to yell for the NSFW tag.

It's been talked about numerous times in here.

you would have to ask the moderators. They turned it off using CSS for a particular reason unknown to me.

RES, by the way, stands for [Reddit Enhancement Suite](

Same here. I made a new BoA account for Bitcoin only, separate from my regular credit union which I can't afford to have frozen since it's what pays the bills and whatnot. declined. High-risk.
So I figured, okay, they see it's a brand-new account. I caved and tried to buy, several times, from my credit union account that I've had for many years. declined. High-risk. 
And this is **with a credit card on file.**   
Once CampBX's ACH deposit method goes online (11/20 with fingers crossed) i'll feel much better.
*Worth mentioning, I guess, I've made a few successful withdrawls to those accounts.

you can doublecheck by going to my comment history and with RES, hover over where it says Bitcoin next to my most recent comment. A pop-up window will appear showing the creation date and number of subscribers.

That is the way I would prefer to do it but my database is corrupted and at the rate it's rebuilding, it'll be a couple days until it's finished.
I'm currently looking at using Armory to import wallet.dat but I'm using a Mac and the release is in beta so I'm a bit concerned about that too.
Thanks for taking the time to answer.

I recently tried out electrum and practiced recovering it on another computer just to be sure I'm comfortable with worst-case scenario type problems. 
It's definitely awesome. Thanks again.
