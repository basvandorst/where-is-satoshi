Dude dont tell people to get out man. If they all sell they will tank the price for us. Instead tell them shit like: “buy the dip” or “average it out”  so chumps would stay in the game.

Always wondered this myself. Can anyone explain?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:40:07
Honestly i dont give a two fuck about bitcoins success, i just want my lambo. If you think greed wasnt the main motivation behind the conception of bitcoin you must be naive.

I sold as soon as it started to drop, fuck that.
