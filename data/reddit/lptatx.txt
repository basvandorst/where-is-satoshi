I work for Dell and wrote the Direct2Dell blog post announcing the bitcoin pilot. New to Reddit, but heard there were a lot of questions here about the announcement, so hope you don't mind me chiming in to say we'll be gauging customer reaction and bitcoin usage to determine expansion plans to other countries. Adding your thoughts to the blog post comments ( will help us do that. Thanks! ~LPT

I work for Dell and just wanted to confirm that yes, the bitcoin promotion will be for Alienware: 10 percent off a new Alienware system purchase (up to $150 limit) when checking out with bitcoin. 
As my blog post noted,  we've been moving very fast on this so, the promotion has not launched yet, but I'll add an update to the blog post when it does.

I don't have access to customer accounts to see exactly what happened in this case, but just one example of something that might lead to a request for verification is a shipping address different from a billing address. We want to protect customers from the possibility someone could be using their information fraudulently.

I work for Dell and wrote the announcement about our bitcoin offering  I hate to hear that you've had trouble. We distributed training documentation to our teams around the globe, but it sounds like not everyone has read it yet. I see that Coinbase has already reached out to help, but if you'd like to work directly with Dell on resolution, let me know.

At this time, it is only possible to purchase with bitcoin in the U.S., but our employees that support U.S. customers are based in a variety of our offices around the world. We'll be gauging feedback and usage during this pilot to make a determination on further roll-out.
