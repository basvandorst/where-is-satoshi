woops,  sorry I'm in litecoin world for some reason.  nm.

are you below the limit?  they require transfers to be above .1 btc.

Lots of lag for me right now,  but it's up.  the market was showing a 4 minute lag time about half an hour ago.  not sure if trading is actually working currently.

And in the process destroy any value in the company they created.  They'd rather sell you hardware than destroy the currency.  It's not something that should be worried about.

How do you guys feel about buying stock in mining companies like cognitive and basicminer?  I like the idea of a dividend,  but the prices seem to bounce so much I'm not sure when to get in.
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:06:59
When you pay a transaction fee to get your verifications done more quickly that fee is added to the block.  So at that point the miners will be mining for the fees.  That is the incentive to keep mining.

Even with crypto coin mining,  Stales are a legit concern,  wasting cycles on completely useless "work"  I agree that some problems are solvable by high latency distributed computing,  but I still think this comparison is silly.

Mining on you own hardware?  Probably very difficult to get back the money you paid for the hardware.  I think It's a much better investment to buy stock in a company that already has the hardware.  Asicminer is a popular and expensive one.  I'm a fan of Cognitive as it's a very transparent company,  but it's got a lot of it's value hinging on BFL,  so who knows if it'll ever pay off.

Maybe next time consider paying a few cents to a graphic designer,  or atleast choose a color that isn't the exact same as the sky behind it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:57:48
If your electricity is free and your hardware is already paid for then yes it's worth it.

I'd recommend doing a "moronic monday" thread for newbies to get their questions answered over creating a new sub.  We've had lots of good luck with this on and This sub isn't yet popular enough to warrant fracturing the userbase with multiple subs.
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:00:27
I think cognitive is under valued right now.  Buying it is basically betting on bfL delivering in a reasonable time.  Its one of the most transparent mining companies around.

The whole point of a currency is that it exchangeable for other things.  If mtgox only traded btc's for oyster crackers it would still be an exchange.  Having a built in exchange to USD would also break the non centralized nature of the currency.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:17:26
Why does Btc-e's price per usd lag behind mtgox by around 8% on average?  Is it just that much harder to get USD into their system?
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:08:23
That single entity is then paying almost half of it's mined coins to owners of it's stock weekly,  Which decentralizes the payments quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:43:49
Nothing really,  Though btc does have a good head start on the things needed for a virtual currency (infrastructure, users, markets, value, etc.)
@_date: 2013-06-16 03:52:25
A single company controlling 20% is unprecedented.    I'm not saying they will ever reach 51%,  but at no other time since maybe very early on has one player had this much hashing power.
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:14:10
Sorry, lag was the wrong word.  Yes it's usually under by about 8%

For anyone who attended the convention,  whats the most interesting news or information that came out of it?

After some research,  it appears that this might be the source of it.  Why does this exist in a public exchange,  and is such a feature available to someone like myself?
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:24:12
was worth a shot...
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:16:54
The price seems to be far more steady these last few days than anytime in the last month.  Do you think the market has matured or is this just a calm before the storm moment?
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:48:17
those are 5000 series gpu's  so yea the number is probably correct.

They are currently mining on fpga systems.  They have several orders for other asics and have assets in place for new systems as they become available.

Beyond what's already been argued it should also be noted that a great many supercomputing tasks require the results from a previous task to move on with the program.  Making a program wait while your pentium 4 in the basement finishes it's math problem so my radeon 7970 knows what it needs to calculate is why you can't really consider the bitcoin network a "super computer"

Duplicate headers error for a bit and now they are back to 1.4

Anyone care to guess what these are actually costing asicminer to produce?
I'm guessing it's less than 15 bucks.
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:41:25
Wow,  that's pretty telling.

He seems to have hidden himself just about as well as satoshi did.  Am I serious,  no.  Are they both anonymous,  yea.

They are as real as gold coins in WOW are.  That's not to say they arent't legitimate,  but real isn't a word I'd use to describe them.

It used a forked kernel for some time.  It's since remerged.
