You only truly know how low it went once it starts to go back up again.
And even if I knew how low it would go, I wouldn't know when an exchange might run out, like Coinbase has.
In that case I'd rather buy at $500 then have nothing while the price is $400.

Sorry things have been down for you, but I'm glad you're getting your laughs in spite of it!
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:37:07
Yeah, I feel like I'm constantly reporting that crap.
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:22:00
Niiice :)

My favorite thing is that it was a true original. Just the completely revolutionary aspect of it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:06:00
Good on them for being upfront about it.

Hey now, show some respect for Bobandy! :)

Fantastic. So how was it? :)
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:22:15
You'll need it.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:58:42
I don't...
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:30:37
Ahh yeah, I had a good laugh over that one too.
I felt like I was in a bar and a friend was drunkenly expressing his love for everyone at the table.

As though they've never had a debit/credit card malfunction when they want to pay for something.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:51:10
Hmm, they haven't incorporated any of the changes, even still calls Gox's actions "abhorrent".
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:43:35
Thank you very much for the bits :)
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:45:49
"Report" "yes" is like second nature to me now, just because of this. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:32:49
It only has to be done in full like that once.
Having to be very patient is well worth the security that wallet adds.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:30:38
Fantastic :)

If they are the only ones who haven't edited their version, it certainly tells me a lot about them as a whole.
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:06:19
Frankly, for a take like this, I can't imagine risking this sort of 'public' sale.
Whoever it really was probably had a buyer before they even started.

Here's how the ancients and modern memorization champions do it - 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:59:14
I hate you for that. Take your damned upvote.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:07:40
Great catch.
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:04:15
Yeah, it's offensive with the -r on.
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:02:58
Everything in the past was grey.

*How did I not see that??*

Here's what the official Bitcoin site has to say about it:
"Bitcoin-Qt is a full Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It offers the highest levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, it has fewer features and it takes a lot of space and memory."
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:01:39
That makes sense.

I'm on another world... can you hide some here?

Please consider looking in on these subreddits:
There are a lot of resources waiting for you there, and many people in the same boat.
Take care.

Sorry, am I seeing that asking price correctly?

Thanks! Hope your cakeday has been a good one :)

Happy cakeday! Also, happy stuffed reddit inbox day! :)

Please don't stick things on banks. Very risky.
