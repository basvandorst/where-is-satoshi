this article has less substance than air  
(I'm not saying a bubble burst is not possible, it's just that the article was a total waste of my valuable time)

1) it shows what kind of a (good) person you are to be able to admit your own 'flaws'  
2) I must have said this over 9083 times. I'm here cause I believe SO FREAKING MUCH in the blockchain. I think it's going to revolutionise some parts (not all) of how we live and work on this planet. If you are in it for the right reasons you think long term (unless you are speculating) and you hodl long term.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I've put some of my money in some ALTS that since then have halved in satoshi value, but I really don't care (at all) ... cause I'm not there to make a quick buck, I'm hyper enthusiastic about their projects / roadmaps / devteam, and possibly all of them combined.

there is only one way this (cute) story has a nice ending: if they both HODL'ed on for dear life.

I'm brand new in the cryptomarket. 
Bought most of my BTC at the $2400 mark.
I can sincerely NOT believe the childish shortsighted behavior of people on here that panicsell.
I mean - even as a newbie I know how bumpy this ride was going to be. I bought the bitcoin (and eth), put it in a safe and I'll open the safe 10 years from now. 
And even so - Currently BTC is worth less than when I bought it , but would you children please look at the graph at a little higher range than just 7d ... Look at the progress we've made in a year.
Stop whining, man/woman up !
