In world where exchanging thousands of cryptos for each other is virtually effortless and extremely minimal in fees, and completely anonymous, you will see every medium-to-major organizational unit of humanity having its own currency, with different fundamental properties.
The Great Evolution will begin, and by the 2050s, we should have some EXTREMELY high-fitness currency systems in use, but even these will merely be forked and used en masse by different entities. THERE WILL NOT BE a single or even MAJOR currency in the future, because per economic physical laws, the smaller the currency, the more all people prosper and the more nimble that economy.
Every city, corporation, etc. will have its own by the 2030s. Hell, I started my own family paper-based currency in 2008 and it's taught my stepkids so frickin much, you have no idea!

I have a contact in Colombia who has bought several big items for me off of Amazon at a 10% discount. I, of course, being a diligent person, inquired of him why he is willing to lose 10% on the transaction.
He informed that while he lives in Colombia, he runs his own business and has his own American travel credit card, but that few merchants in Colombia accept credit cards, especially for larger purchases, due to rampant fraud in the country. He also explained how he accrues even more points via Amazon.
He also explained that buying tickets from inside Colombia to other countries costs roughly double their fair market value (if you go from Texas to Colombia, it costs $500 round trip, Colombia to Texas costs $1,000+), but the cost via frequent flier miles is constant.
So for him, it is a no-brainer. Subsidized airfare at 50% off his otherwise cost for 10% cost in Amazon.

Excuse me. I have many thousnads equivalent in bitcoin, and I simply do not worry about the possibility of inflation in an appreciating currency.
Let's talk again when BTC is somewhere around the 10th most appreciating currency / commodity in the world, not  by a huge margin!
Realistically, bitcoin supply could inflate by several more multiples than the 12.5 BTC per bock, and I would be fine, as long as the Bitcoin GDP grew at a higher rate.

Shapeshift still has unpublished bugs that result in, at least temporary, loss of coins!
I, personally, had 359 ETH, then valued at $5,385 USD get LOST via Shapeshift because, as their owner told me via Twitter, the Jaxx wallet I was using did not properly support the Precise payment method, and that I was supposed to only use Quick.
I did the first 150+ ETH transaction on a Sunday, 10 July, because I predicted ETH's price would start really decreasing, and I sent the support ticket in at 6 AM CDT. 
I did not receive a reply back from support.
On 11 July, I started seeing ETH drop a lot, and I felt like I had to risk another large transaction, so I made another trade at 6:55 EDT, but it too got lost. I submitted another support ticket.
At 10:30 EDT, I became gravely concerned, since it was near the closing time of Shapeshift (in the UK) and I had not received a response, and ETH was decreasing in value, and my funds were lost. So I posted a [**twitter post**]( and started talking with the Shapeshift CEO.
Hours and hours later, my funds were still not able to be returned. ETH had slipped from about 15 to 12 in the interim, and I got pretty frustrated with support for not being able to quickly make me whole. Apparently, commenting about two losses on one ticket confused them.
 By 7:13 PM EDT on 2016-07-11, all of my 359 coins had been returned and this was the message I received:




But at that point, the price was now at $10.5 USD. So I sold all the ETH for around $3,776.68 more than 37 hours after I had made the initial exchange.
Total loss: $1,608 (29.87%) minus Bitcoin opportunity profit.
I have been exceptionally wary of Shapeshift since, but I do not know of any alternatives.

Hey buddy. Give me your private bitcoin keys, destroy your copy for safety reasons, and I will store them in geographically dispersed locations in a cold storage wallet.
When you want to withdraw it, it will take me a lot of time to unlock the multiple safes in multiple countries and warm up your cold BTCs, but just wait a few hours, maybe a few days, and we'll be good, right?
That's assuming I can find someone willing to sell more BTC to me at hopefully a cheaper price. I know! I can get a shitcoin to make a shitty decision, have it's controversey bleed over into BTC and then buy both the shitcoin and the BTC at reduce rates! I stay in business, for now, and make money!!!

Suppose you transfer 10,000 BTC to a paper wallet in your safe in Mexico City from, say, your smart phone in Phoenix, Arizona. Then you drive across the border.
Is that illegal? I have paid a serious law firm some serious money to investigate this issue, and no, it is not illegal in any means, since bitcoin is a commodity and you can ship commodities anywhere, without the U.S. needing to know.
Now, suppose you take the same cell phone, but you keep a wallet with access to 20 BTC stored on it. Then you drive across the border, without declaring it.
This is **probably** illegal, in both the U.S. and Mexico. I say **probably** because semantically, the coins are on the phone (it does have access to them) but *physically* they are in The Cloud, which is spread across a great many countries. *Technically*, it is up for intense legal debate whether having access to the funds is technicaly transporting the funds. Because, right now, it's totally legal to cross with a debit card with more than $10,000 accessible, and that's *sort of* the same thing.
But GOOD LUCK explaining that to customs officials, of any country! You're probably going to have a horrible night's sleep, at a minimum!

I have a legit question, from one web CEO to another.
When you knew that ETH was going to hard fork days in advance, why did you consider it a good corporate strategy to officially support ETH within the same 24 hour window as the ETH hard fork?
Certainly, isn't it more ideal and intelligent to ... i don't know... WAIT A WHILE (like a month, 6 months, *certainly a week!*) if only to see how this event, which may be the first in the history of the entire Galaxy, would unfold????
It seems like it is outright treacherous and scandalous to execute such a huge floating target upon the heads of all of your staff, not to mention the millions of customers, who could have been DEVASTATED if Ethereum had failed outright at the date of the fork... and let's face it, that was NOT outside the realm of possibility.
It seems like this decision to add Ethereum support to coinbase on the very day of the Ethereum hardfork is such extreme negligence and so cavalier that I, for one, think you must have some sort of negative ulterior motive.
After some thought, riddle me this.
You have a personal stake in Ethereum, and you probably are good friends with the Ethereum CEO. 
Post The DAO being launched without suitable code review or auditing, and your friend being out of pocket by several millions and pretty disgraced in the hackerspace, he decided to hard fork and set the date for July 20.
After the fork, as a major holder of ETH, he also had the same shareholding in ETC immediately after the fork, right?
So What if the plan is to fuck over Bitcoin, fuck over Ethereum, and cause their huge market caps to *FLEE* into Ethereum Classic?
Coinbase, having complete control over their ETHC wallets, just keeps hoarding.
Coinbase then lets lie a software bug everyone from ETH devs to CB CEO admits they had forknowledge but everyone chose to do nothing... Coinbase then doesn't immediately fix it after some guy exposes the exploit on twitter... An ensuing rumor develops and BTC's price quickly goes from $655 to $610.
Now, let's continue and say that in the coming days Coinbase admits that, surprise surprise, they are insolvent due to numerous issues (there was speculation prior to all this Eth nonsense).
If BTC flash crashes to $100, ETH goes to $0, ETC goes to $600. 
Cui bono?
Suddenly, gross incompetence on the parts of both CEOs doesn't look so incompetent... It looks like a possible design... 
Rockerfeller and Morgan conspired much the same with the dismantling of Standard Oil in the early 1990s. Sure, it disappeared, but several mom and pop gasoline stores went national, and Rockerfeller and Morgan ended up with far more valuable stock in 6 companies after about 20 years.

Um... Look at it this way:
I traveled from the U.S. to Colombia two weeks ago. When I left, I had 15 bitcoins worth, at that time, $6,750 [ ea], sitting in my Coinbase.com account. When I was in the two countries' airports and at customs, I only had $100 USD and $100,000 COP [~$30 USD] in my pocket. And I declared as much on my form, completely truthfully.
As soon as I was in my Colombian apartment, I sent the bitcoins to my wallet, now inside Colombia. As of today, those 15 coins are worth $8,625.
I run a corporation here. Today, I spent $14,000,000 COP for 8.235 bitcoins. The man was panicking about bitcoin dropping to $570, so I got them for $1.70 million each ($567) while every other seller wanted $1.8 million ($600).
Now I have 23.235 bitcoins on my phone, right now, in multiple accounts (I certainly do not co-mingle non-US-sourced coins with U.S.-sourced ones, for obvious reasons!).
Right now, 23.235 bitcoins is WELL OVER the $10,000 USD (or $30 million pesos) limits for traveling undeclared in both countries. ($13,360 @ $575). BUT!
Whenever I want, I can easily send any amount to my two cold storage wallets (I have their addresses stored in my wallet).
In a possibly over-abundance of caution, I always zero-out my wallets to cold storage before I leave a country. Then I have my secretary show me my private key via webcam and I load up whatever I need once I arrive.
I have discussed this with two attorneys (in each country), and they both said, per letter of the law, there is nothing wrong with simply sending the equivalent of an email to myself containing money, just as I could, almost as easily, with my multinational Paypal Account (banks in multiple countries).
Unfortunately for me, Paypal pulled out of Colombia in Dec 2015 [and took my business' payment processor with it! Urgh!] But honestly? I see Western Union, Paypal, et. al. as being obseleted mainstream in just a few more years.
If you utilize this knowledge, please consider giving me a [small bitcoin tip]( This trick has saved me thousands of dollars and months of time getting money in and out of Colombia (bank transfers take 2-3 weeks; western union over $500 takes 1-2 weeks).

OTC in America and Europe largely avoids taxes, particularly when the bitcoins are housed, stored and used outside of the United States, there is a 100% legal tax avoidance scheme.
You will NEVER EVER see Elites use bitcoin on exchanges, because right now, one of its primary utilities is as an ALTERNATIVE to Bermuda, and its second primary utility is to escape capital controls.
Both of these will set you up for investigation and taxation and so you're never, ever going to use an exchange.
For instance, an early bitcoin adopter [2009] who has 10,000 coins isn't going to sell on an exchange and get a 44.9% tax bill on 99% of the sale!
No, that person is going to 
1. Hire a Swiss lawyer specializing in cryptocurrencies [I know for a fact that several high profile ones exist]
2. The lawyer is going to scour the globe for Elites who have Deep Pockets. Hell, I know a guy who's lawyer has contacts in the UAE and convinced a sultan to buy his first bitcoins. $100,000 was nothing to this guy. 
3. For serious transaction trades [in excess of $50,000], it is very customary for the trade to happen like this:
    1. Rich Person meets Attorney in a Conducive Country [Bermuda, Cyprus, etc.]
    2. Payment is made, usually in Gold, sometimes in cash.
    3. Rich Person is given an encrypted paper wallet, in person.
    4. Rich Person stuffs the paper wallet in their gold safe.
    5. Gold is liquidated at set intervals, into a Trust for The Seller, owned by the Law Firm [to avoid FACTA and other restrictions on U.S. citizens],
    6. The Seller is advised to never move the money into the United States, to travel and spend it abroad [perfectly legal, tax free], and to live outside of the U.S. for 336+ days a year, they can co-opt it legally back in at $100,000 a year. Or have a foreign wife who is -not- a green card / citizen and lives outside the U.S. for more than 6 months a year, and then The Seller can transfer up to 10.5 million a year through her without raising flags.
    7. At $650 a coin, the lawyers usually do this for 15-20% over spot. Usually it is the seller that pays, because everyone knows the primary reason elites do this is tax avoidance.
Hell, I know a guy who got married to a trustworthy woman in a foreign land he hardly ever sees, just to implement this.

I don't regret it so much, because now he has millions of views, I watch his vids every day, and he's positively affecting millions of people daily, too.
In 2017, I sold everything at around $18,500. I've been in gold and oil futures and, since January, shorting the fuck out of the FANGs. I'm betting hard that Bitcoin is the harbinger of the next wave of worldwide bearish market sentiment.
This bear trend is going to wipe out all the weak cryptos. And from the perspective of someone who runs several major ecommerce deployments of bitcoin, I can tell you that these bear markets *really* increase demand for the actually as-a-currency *primary* usecase, as people find it easier to buy products with a falling bitcoin than find actual buyers-of-bitcoin. 
My crypto carts are booming right now! 10-20x volume as of Winter 2017.

Most of the foreign holders of Bitcoin I know (largely in Colombia and India) are used to the banks charging 10%, the government taking 5%, the banker outright stealing 5% and threatening a 90 day "investigatory hold" AND a 2-5% rape on the currency exchange.
Then you have the local currency exchangers who just implement all that into one and rape you with 10-20% currency fees up front, but this is almost always cheaper than the bank wire, but you can only do a max of $9,900.00 at a pop, or you get arrested at either side of the Customs fence.
-OR- You can buy bitcoin. Problem is, there is no bitcoin exchange in your currency at all. So you have to find ways to find bitcoin. You find that you can buy Amazon gift cards with your Colombian credit card. But that does no you good, because Amazon stopped allowing shipment to Colombian addresses in December 2014, because Colombians like you were buying physical goods, getting them shipped via the bulk shippers at very low costs, and hawking the goods directly.
So you learned that you can buy Amazon gift cards, sell them to Americans for bitcoin, and you don't mind losing a certain percent, because 1) you don't have many other options, 2) you're going to lose 20-30% anyway, even if you had cash, and 3) you believe bitcoin will rise more in value in the future.

Seriously, I buy drinks with Bitcoin from CVS (I don't smoke), I buy my groceries from WholeFoods with Bitcoin, and I buy coffee at Starbucks with Bitcoin. I buy burgers at BurgerKing with Bitcoin, and I buy GameStop gift cards with Bitcoin and then immediately trade them in for Shell Oil and Taco Bell gift cards.
I really like how I can pay for IHOP with Bitcoin, too!
And people sell me Amazon gift cards at 40% markups for Bitcoin!!
I have lived 99% off of Bitcoin since March. You just aren't trying.

I just want to know why I was cut from $2,000/day limit to $100/day. I need to move $2,000/week just to move my paycheck... 
It was certainly because I sent a single 0.25 BTC bet to BitBet the day of the drop.

The problem is that the blockchain is public, and I'm pretty sure they'd want you to prove it. It's better to buy gold and hide it.
@_date: 2016-07-17 01:24:47
This is exactly what happened to me... I made a bet on BitBet via coinbase wallet 2 weeks ago and BAM! $2,000/day limit reduced to $100.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:18:35
I got banned from coinbase 33 days ago for sending 0.05 to my girlfriend's coins.ph account. I still don't know why.
I was buying $10,000/month. Now i can barely scrap by $500/day via localbitcions at incredibly poor margins.  Bank-to-Bank WF and BoA seem to be my only options. 
I am an American citizen living in India, do not have an Indian bank account, bitcoins here cost $3300, so I'm better off at LocalBitcoins for $3000. But no one in India or LBC have the means to sell me anywhere near $10,000 a month.
I currently have $80,000 i want to invest, plus $60,000 in gold and silver i'd like to convert. But I just can't move it! Kraken.com took OVER TWENTY EIGHT DAYS and they just approved me for Tier 1 (ability to DEPOSIT crypto) and NO ONE ELSE has approved me.
I last bought bitcoin at $1850 and feel like i totally missed the wave, HOWEVER I still have to pay employees in Bitcoin across 4 continents and 8 countries (US, UK, CO, CR, BH, IR, IN, and PH) and I can barely get 2 a week, but only if I stay up til 1 to 2 AM cuz of the 12 1/2 hour time difference.
I've aksed everywhere... no one has advice. HOW DO YOU DO IT?!
@_date: 2016-07-17 01:33:47
OK what at less than 5% over spot?
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:49:09
I would just buy a few gold coins, with Bitcoin, every week, after filtering the coins through ShapeShift IO to one of the unknown cryptos and back again. The tricky part is figuring out how to get each shipment sent to a different address not tied to me... 
A million dollars would fit into 50 pounds (714 troy oz / 14.5 troy oz / lb).

On 12 May, I had 1.00000 BTC arriving from my Bank of America bank account, for $1852. $1852 was withdrawn from BoA then 23 minutes later, I got a "Your coinbase account has been closed due to violating the terms and services" but i hadn't been.
It took 10 days and a twitter storm for them to finally contact me, via twitter (their email-only support is an absolute joke) and give me my coins back.
I applied to every USD exchange except Bitstamp (cuz of FACTA requirements) and NONE of them have approved me except Bitwage, yesterday. So I still do not have the capability of buying BTC.
I buy $500 worth of BTC every 3rd day via LBC if I stay up til 1 AM. I am an American citizen living in Hyderabad, India, for the last year, so cash deposits (all the rage at LocalBitcoins) is unavailable to me.
Did I mention that I have 35 employees and I'm struggling to pay them for over a month now?? At this point, I need to purchase something like $10,000 worth of BTC immediately and I'm looking to move $50,000+. But that seems impossible these days. No one helps.

Hi, I am American who recently moved to Bogota, Colombia, last year.
Many Top 10% Colombians have American credit cards, with reward miles. Unfortunately, very few places in Colombia accept credit cards, so day to day, usually only the grocery store, and restaurants will accept them (you have trouble at tech stores, because usually, due to fraud, they are not accepted on purchases over $200).
I have met several over LocalBitcoins who offer 20-40% off Amazon.com Wishlist purchases. I queried two of the guys I've done repeat business with, and he told me this:
Buying $250-500+ worth of Amazon wish list items greatly helps them accrue credit card points, mainly used for air travel.
It is no joke that when I try to buy a ticket from Colombia to the United States, when I am in the United States, it costs $500. When I am in Colombia, the exact ticket costs $850-1000. The websites just charge the poor Colombians double.
This may be a legit reason why some foreigners choose that route.

On 16 May, Coinbase closed my account apprently because I sent 0.05 BTC to a brand new employee in the Philippines to what turned out to be their coins.ph account. That is the ONLY non-standard transfer.
I run my own multinational corporation with branches in Nevada, Houston, Costa Rica, Colombia, The Bahamas, Ireland and India, with employees in all those countries plus The Philippines and UK. 
Until now, I have used BTC to pay everyone. Prior to moving permanently to India where I have setup and am running a new and my biggest venture (25 employees), I routinely traded via LocalBitcoin in the United States, the few times I was there. But I haven't set foot there since Dec 16, and I won't be back for months and months.
I have relied totally on Coinbase since arriving in India last July, and now apparently I'm screwed.
I have registered at Bitfinex (then found out no USD deposits, fuck), Poloneix, Kraken and Bitwage. Everything is pending. Bitwage doesn't like me because I"m a Texan living in Hyderabad on a non-permanent visa and live in a hotel. I'm not permitted an Indian bank account, ID card or any suitable "proof of residency", but I have all that for Texas. Still, they don't like the idea, because I guess it's pretty non-standard.
I wrote this post on last week but the mods deleted it.
I just don't know what the fuck to do!!! I can't buy bitcoin in india. It's NOT AVAILABLE, the government has HUGE capital controls on money (~$200/week is all that's allowed to withdrawn) and wire transfers from Houston to Hyderabad are flagged as "fraud" by both my bank and Western Union, despite me on the phone constantly. 
NO one gives a damn.
Western Union has refused 4 payments from me via both bank account and credit card, despite me on the phone with them for literal hours, to both the Philippines and Colombia an Costa Rica, and also to India.
So right now, I literally have 35 people who haven't been paid since before May 16. NONE of my accounts have been verified... People are LITEREALLY being kicked out of thier homes, because it's June  7 and the rent is way past due.
I feel sooo fucking hopeless and helpless! I have tens of thousands of dollars in U.S. corporate and personal accounts but find it nearly impossible to get the money moving!!!!!
MUST I fly back to America and use localbitcoin?!?
Right now, I've resorted to buying gold from APMEX.com, shipping it to my brother, and having him go to Western Union with cash, because my bank accounts REFUSE to let me do a wire transfer over the phone and no one has a Bank of America account.
I've also setup XE.com xfers to the UK, which work in a relatively reasonable time frame (2-4 business days), however, from past experiences, it takes 2-4 weeks to do the same to Colombia and probably the Philippines. Plus with Colombia, I have to submit complex bureaucratic proofs of "origin of income" for every cent.

Right now I literally have my mom and brother pulling out cash from my bank account and sending via Western Union. WU blocked me because they say they will not do business with an American in India with no proof of address (i've lived in a hotel for 12 months).  But even they are limited to $1,000 to $2,000 per transaction and they can only have time to do it 1 to 2x a week.
I'm paying three employee's apartment bills and everything via my credit card, cuz at least that's international and available. But only in the UK and Ireland. Everywhere else, no one accepts cards for such things.
