I'm confused how this is supposed to work. It's not like crypto is a piece of land that will sit there and anybody could potentially come and start using it. You still need the keys. And nobody is just going to abandon crypto along with the keys, where it could be taken and sold.
And if say a person dies and the keys are with their documents or whatever, shouldn't that just be considered part of their estate? And treated the same way as the rest of their property?
I almost think the people proposing these laws don't actually understand how crypto works. They have probably heard stories of it being lost, either by losing the keys or the computer or whatever, and they think that the coins can somehow be recovered. They just need to be found or something first. Lol

Are you done buying Bitcoin? If you're never buying any more, then yeah you need to stop looking. But if you might want to buy more, maybe put aside $20 a week (or whatever amount works for you) and then when you check the price and see it has dropped, you can use some of the money you set aside to buy a bit more. Make it a positive experience instead of a negative one.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:20:48
Thanks, but now I feel like a jerk because I wasn't trying to ask for tips, lol. I was just hoping for a witty joke or something.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:57:36
I was looking into getting some Bitcoin when it was under $100. Honestly it was only because I wanted to buy drugs on Silk road. So if I did buy any I probably would have spent it all. Although maybe I would have seen what a good thing it is earlier and got some to hold on to. Oh well.

Easy there. You have no proof Trump supporters are racist. I mean, it's not like Trump is going around telling people of colour to go back to where they came from, even though they were born in America... What's that...?  He.. he said that today? Oh. Well, I'm sure there's some easily explained reason other than that he's racist. There must be.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:25:57
Thanks for the info. I'm never going to touch the day trading aspect of Bitcoin because I know I would go broke. I just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:51:25
Chances of me becoming a millionaire using that: 0%
Chances of me becoming a millionaire if I just buy and HODL:  Also 0%, but at least I won't go broke this way.
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:01:15
I see. I'll probably try it out tomorrow. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:50:18
Hm, maybe saying not to do it is the real joke.  I better send mine, just in case.
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:52:16
But but but you lose money if you don't sell!
I'm fine with not losing my entire stack trying to day trade. I just know if I ever tried it, the price would instantly skyrocket after I sell. And that would be actually losing money.
Not getting extra profit isn't the same as losing money.

Before Bitcoin people had no choice but to ride the ship down. At least now lifeboats are available and if people are smart enough and quick enough they can jump onto one. Unfortunately for a lot of people it will be too late by the time they realize the ship is sinking.

I've been using Shakepay for a month now, and any time I move crypto to my own wallet it's pretty fast. Would definitely recommend them.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:20:38
So answer this for yourself. Is it more important to you to get small profits here and there that you admit you want and don't need? Or is it more important to hold off on those profits for a larger return in the future?  Since neither is a need, both can be valid options, and I don't think it's dumb to take profits just because you want them. Maybe not the best plan financially, but if it's going to make you happy to take out profits and buy something nice for yourself that's ok. As long as you are aware of the reasons you're doing it and ok with less future profit.

Thanks to this post I spent some crypto at the online poker site listed. Started with $50, lost $10 on the slots because I'm stupid, but now playing poker I'm up to $55. Once I hit $100 I'm going to withdraw in BTC and HODL!
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:41:23
Damn, that's sad.
Downtown in my city is seeing a lot more ranting, paranoid, mentally ill people walking up and down the streets these past few years. It always makes me sad to see them, because nobody chooses to end up like that. Hopefully this dude gets some help and doesn't end up like that.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:13:11
Not your bad. Your good. Since it's dropping we can all buy more to hodl!  :D
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:40:23
But if you are using a hardware wallet you have to put in the PIN, and then confirm on the wallet, to send anything. So Microsoft can't just hijack and empty it.

Because you can only pay in crypto. Also, even if it wasn't a scam, and that was how you get verified, it's still a scam.

Oh, well $2600 a month, that changes everything. Now it's totally legit and not a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:54:19
Bringing up gift card scams is important. They need to understand that the ATM location is no more at fault than Walmart when they sell gift cards that are used for a scam. Just because your location is used doesn't mean you are in on it. People also get scammed all the time through their own bank account. Again, it's not the bank doing the scam.
Vast majority of people using Bitcoin aren't doing anything illegal with it. Point out how most people use it as ways to send money, purchase legal things, or invest.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:22:29
I've read that now is a good time to underpay your taxes. IRS has lost a lot of their funding recently, and don't have the number of people they need to do everything properly. So instead of going after audits on people with a high income and more complicated taxes, they are going after the easier audits on lower income people with simpler taxes. So if your taxes are really complicated due to crypto, and you did pay something, chances are they aren't going to spend the man hours to dig into it and make sure it's exactly correct.
But really, don't listen to me, I can't even remember where I read that. It sure sounds like it could be true though, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:47:35
So why not just buy and hodl it all? Do you need the profits here and there or just want?
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:08:58
Well, of course you shouldn't be proud of it. But honestly, you should be proud that you are willing to put yourself out there and tell others about your experience. Potentially saving others from having the same thing happen to them, even if doing do might get certain people to laugh at you. Most people who get scammed are so embarrassed that they fell for it that they will never tell anybody what happened to them. And the scammers love that, because then less people are aware of their scams.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:38:21
Your question has already been answered, but I just want to add something. Never be embarrassed about asking a question. If you don't know, ask. I'm sure there are many people out there who got into crypto, but didn't want to feel embarrassed, so they didn't ask. And then they messed up. Lost their coins or got scammed.
Sure, I've seen a few people on here give a dickish response to a noob question, but vast majority of posters here are helpful and don't want to see newcomers screw up and lose their coin. And hey, what would you rather happen, ask and feel embarrassed but gain knowledge, or don't ask, and screw up, and lose your coin?
Also, you can check out r/BitcoinBeginners and ask/learn a lot there.

Dude, I'm not trying to make you seem stupid or sick because of your opinion. I don't even know what your opinion is. That is part of the problem. Your writing style comes off as unhinged and almost manic or paranoid.
Maybe you are perfectly fine. Sorry if that's the case. It's just that if you are having mental issues, I would rather you get help and tackle those issues instead of ignoring them and possibly ending up as one of those ranting people on the street.
So maybe just try to calm down and take it easy when you are writing out posts, and people won't think you are crazy.

Is it the job of a business owner to make as much money as he can even when it breaks the law? As long as they can get away with it, is it ok? Because many many businesses do that to their employees, and they get away with it either because the people don't have the money to fight it, or it doesn't get reported, or whatever.
I'm sorry you view the world as a place totally lacking in morals, and that it can never change. There are many people out there who aren't like that, and eventually things will come around to that way of thinking. In the last few hundred years humanity has come leaps and bounds in how they treat each other. Yes, there is still a very long way to go, but just because something is a certain way now doesn't mean it can't change.

I'm new to Bitcoin, and I stay far far away from the day trading stuff. I've seen a few posts in the past few days about "longs" or "shorts" being liquidated. What does that mean? If I'm just doing the hodl thing, should I care about it?

I was wondering, I don't think governments can really stop Bitcoin, but could they stop Bitcoin mining? Once it gets really lucrative, it could reach a point where the US government makes a law that only they can mine Bitcoin. And of course then other countries could follow. And now even though we tried to get away from governments controlling our money, they would now still be controlling it, just in another way.
I don't think it would be too difficult for them to stop mining either. Law enforcement already can track down people with grow ops due to their energy consumption, so it wouldn't be difficult to track down mining ops by the huge amounts of energy they are using.
Just a thought. I honestly am the furthest from an expert, so I would love to hear how I am wrong on this. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:00:05
Interesting read for a crypto newbie like me.  I'm only about half way through so far. One part that stood out to me was this:
"A good X that was in the process of being monetized may be outcompeted by another good Y that is more suitable as money, and the monetary premium of X may drop or vanish entirely."
That sentence tells me that while crypto will last the long term, it won't necessarily be Bitcoin. I'm still putting most of my crypto money into Bitcoin, but that reason is why I'm not 100% into it.

A buddy of mine at work sold his at $12k. He's now saying he's waiting for it to dip more before getting back in. I'm trying to tell him about the greatness of hodling, but he wants to do the day trading thing. And today was telling me about the money to be made with shitcoins once Bitcoin starts to take off. I can't stop him from making bad decisions, but damn it sucks to watch somebody get ready to throw away money and there's nothing I can do to stop him.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:22:13
If you come across something that looks like the most amazing opportunity ever and guarantees a great return, first thing you do is STOP.
Just like everything else in this world, if it looks too good to be true, it is. Don't get scammed. If you are unsure of something, ask somebody else about it. Google it. Don't become another story on the internet about how you got scammed out of your Bitcoin.
Also, if you plan on having enough BTC that you'd worry about losing it, just spend the money and get a hardware wallet.

But are you doing it for fun or because you think there is big profit in it? I don't know the specifics of Dogecoin, but I'd assume, like other coins, there isn't a lot of profit to be made unless you really invest into it.
If you just want to have fun and set up your own mining rig, and make a few bucks, sure, go for it. But you aren't getting rich off mining. Because if you could get rich off mining with minimal investment, everybody else would already be doing it.

And know that in a year I will also be looking at this post. And I will be laughing from my solid gold house at you. Hey future you! This is future me! I made a bunch of money and you didn't because you got scared and sold! Now I own THE MOON! What do you own? Not any Bitcoin, that's for sure!!!
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:37:14
Do NOT try to chase your loses. You already tried it once and it lost you half your coins. Count this as an expensive lesson. Yes, it absolutely sucks, but those coins are gone. If you keep trying to find a way to get them back, chances are you will just lose more.
I know you said you just want to gain a few % back, but what if you lose instead?  Nothing is guaranteed in Bitcoin. And what if you DO gain those few %? Do you really think you will stop there? Most likely you will think you found a good way to get it all back, so you keep trying, and then you lose even more.
Your best bet if you REALLY want those coins back is to make some personal sacrifices, either put in overtime hours, or sell something you own, or cut back on your spending, and use that money to buy more. It's the only way to get it back without probably losing even more.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:50:11
You are way too late to the game to make any decent money mining. If you're mining BTC then you need to spend a lot of money just to get a tiny bit of profit. Or you can invest less money and mine shitcoins, but then what's the point?  You also have to keep in mind the cost of electricity while you mine. So if you just want to mine shitcoins for fun and maybe make a few bucks a month, go for it, but if you're looking at making real money, you're better off just buying BTC with it and hodling.
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:51:58
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:37:29
But but but, they are going to pay him just to go to an ATM! $2700 a month!! It couldn't POSSIBLY be cheaper for them to buy BTC elsewhere!
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:57:54
In that case, who determines if it is abandoned? Maybe somebody is just hodling for 20+ years. Or maybe they passed on the key to somebody else. I don't like the idea of the state determining whether they can take money or not.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:20:53
Hmm, I seem to have failed at this. I can't do anything right. I did like the story though! :(
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:52:53
The exchange I use to buy BTC gave me $10, but that was only after my first $100 deposit. And if I refer somebody we each get $10. But if they are going to give you money just for signing up, then that is definitely a scam. You don't get something for nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:03:14
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:15:08
I'll take that bet (and also not pay).
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:18:49
Correct, it's not a responsibility. But if you want more people to use it, a lot of those people are going to need a bit of help or pointers when starting. If a bunch of new people try to adopt crypto, but then get turned off because of high fees they could have avoided, or scams they didn't know weren't legit, and the crypto community just gives them a shrug and a lol, that isn't good for anybody. Doesn't help the new users, and doesn't help the crypto users. Maybe helps the fiat banks because now they run bank to the banks and tell their friends how shitty and stupid crypto is.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:12:19
Apparently once bitcoin reaches mass adoption there will be no more speeding fines.
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:06:39
Lol! Alright then. I was thinking maybe it was the name of some bitcoin guy who was behind some exchange or something.

@_date: 2019-07-15 16:52:47
Does the amount of confirmations matter?
I was just looking at my wallet and noticed different transactions have quite different amounts. Most of them are between around 170 and 430, but I have one from yesterday still at only 2, while the other one from yesterday received at almost the same time is in the 180s. Not sure if this is something that matters.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:36:57
Pretty sure you can ask ANYBODY "Would you like to go back a few years and buy some Bitcoin?", and the answer would be yes.

You spelled hodl wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:23:09
By moving around, I mean from where you got it to your own wallet.  For a first time user who has no idea what they are doing, it's not a dumb idea to practice that with an amount where if you screw up, it's not going to hurt you. And sure, if he wants to see the process of sending it to another wallet as well he can do that. Again, better to do that with a couple bucks and figure out what you're doing than to do it with real money and screw it up.
@_date: 2019-07-21 07:04:21

I also want to thank everyone here who answers questions. A lot of the stories about crypto I have seen in places that aren't strictly about crypto are almost always about people losing money. So it was a little scary to take the jump and get into it. I wish I had stumbled across this place back in March when I was first thinking about buying some, but oh well.
@_date: 2019-07-13 19:23:45

It's actually the same building as the Bitcoin Cash CEO, only the Bitcoin CEO is on the top floor, while the Bitcoin Cash CEO has a small corner office in the sub basement.
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:02:39
I agree. That paragraph might scare a lot of people away. It's good to talk about the responsibility aspect, so they know that if they lose their keys they lose their coin, but talking about how it's a paradigm shift might make some people think it's just some crazy scam. Especially if they just want to get in to invest.
First get them into it, and show them how it's not that difficult. Then talk about how it's the future of money.

So for once I'm NOT grouped with the fools. Awesome.
A guy at work that I talk Bitcoin with has said he wants to do the buying and selling thing. Not daily, but still trying to buy and sell repeatedly as it rises. He told me he recently sold at around $12k and was waiting to get back in. It worked for him this time, but I'm trying to talk him out of doing that because I don't want him to show up one day talking about how he lost thousands.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:15:34
What, you mean to tell me every fruit vendor on the street isn't sitting there with over $4000 cash so they can provide change to somebody paying with a gold bar???

@_date: 2019-07-27 18:09:37
I wouldn't store a paper wallet in a safe deposit box. It's not super uncommon for a bank to mess up and empty your box by mistake when an account is past due. All property in it is supposed to be kept safe at a storage facility, but often times things go missing. And if somebody finds your paper wallet and they know what they are looking at, bye bye coins. At least if you have a hardware wallet in a safe deposit box, if somebody finds it, they wouldn't get into it.

I'm learning a lot on this sub, but as a new crypto user it can be hard because a lot of people talk about general concepts that it seems everyone else already knows about, so it's nice to be able to read something that gives me a better handle on how to do things.
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:46:38
I'm new in crypto but I'll give you my answer. I just started buying BTC less than a month ago, and I got a hardware wallet before I even bought any.  I've read too many stories about people losing their coin that I didn't want to become one of them.  So if you are planning on holding for the long term I'd say just get one.
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:45:22

I've gone through longer periods of unemployment, and it does get boring. There was things I could have done to better spend the time, but I think just having so much time made me lazy and just want to put things off.

You're saying a guy who has no idea how to invest in something should just drop $500 on it? Yes, of course it would have been best if he learned before putting any money in, but if the guy just wants to see how it works and practice moving the money around $40 is way smarter than $500.
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:13:32
When you say that won't appeal to a large part of the population, do you mean just the crypto population, or the population as a whole?  Because I think the population as a whole doesn't care as much about those things. So if Facebook released a coin that was super easy to get into, it's possible for more people to use it, and then it becomes full scale accepted as money, even though technically it's a lesser coin.
Not saying I think that's going to happen, just talking future possibilities.  When it comes to getting the average person on the street to adopt a system, they won't always pick the choice that is in their own best interest.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:51:27
Got it. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:14:40
And I don't know so much about Alibaba, or Airbnb, but Uber and Facebook are just generally horrible. Facebook because of all the obvious private data/privacy concerns and they have also admitted to manipulating the way people feel. And Uber takes advantage of both their customers and their drivers in horrible ways. Surge pricing during disasters/attacks. Drivers aren't actually employees so Uber gets away with treating them like shit.
So I'd rather Bitcoin not get lumped in with them.
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:48:09
If somebody is so worried about it they are having dreams it went to 0, maybe they just shouldn't buy. It seems like either it will go up a bit and they will cash out because they are afraid of it dropping, or it will drop and they will cash out because they are afraid it will keep going. Shouldn't put in scared money, too easy to make mistakes that way.
I want it to get more widely adopted, but I don't want people to have bad experiences and then tell everybody about how they didn't like it.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:46:13
I think he means by buying it, they are hoping it will go up and result in a profit. That's the gamble. Not that they are sending the BTC to poker sites to play with.

I'm loving this dip. I was wanting to start buying BTC back in March, but I'm lazy as hell and procrastinate. I only started buying a few weeks ago so it's nice to be able to get some more money in a bit cheaper.

I'm no expert, but I'll give it my best shot.
One is Bitcoin, the other is a shitcoin.
All jokes aside, I don't really know anything about Bitcoin cash, but the mere fact that they try to pretend to be Bitcoin by using r/btc is enough for me to stay away.

I'd love for it to go that low because I got in recently, but I really don't think it will happen. I'm happy it went as low as it did so I could buy more for cheaper than I was.

Unfortunately my oracle is in the shop, so I can't foresee anything until the winter. I'll just have to hodl for now, I guess.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:05:54
There are also a lot of people who have BTC on multiple addresses. So every address does not equal one user.
Also, when talking about less than 1% world population, you have to remember that is worldwide. How many people are invested in gold or silver? And the currency of most countries isn't used anywhere other than that specific country. Very few currencies are actually used worldwide. So yes it looks very small, but it's still used more than many other things out there, and it's only getting bigger.

@_date: 2019-07-21 17:37:41
If you want to buy and hold, definitely get a hardware wallet. You mentioned stolen often, but that is only because people don't keep their own keys. If you leave your coins in somebody else's control, they are easier to get stolen.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:52:27
But you can't tell which addresses are linked to a wallet, right? So as long as they use a new address on that wallet, while it is traceable to that address, it's not traceable to the wallet owner. I'm new to crypto so idk maybe I'm wrong, but that's what I had read before...
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:07:25
Anybody mind explaining what this means?
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:42:32
When he says sorted, I think he means how does it choose between two transactions with similar low fees. So if there are 2 transactions and both have the exact fee, which is a low one, which will get taken and why?
At least I think that's what he means...

I'm not angry at the rich/business people who provide services and pay taxes, I'm angry at the ones who make it their life's purpose to suck up every dollar from any place they can. Dodging taxes, paying minimum wage (or less) when their workers work their asses off, laying people off just to get another decimal point on their bonus. Those people don't want the best for their country, they only want the best for themselves.
AND I'm angry at the government and banks.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:57:31
Are you French french, or Canadian french? If you're Canadian you can use Shakepay to buy BTC. It's super quick with interac e-transfers. I just started buying there a couple weeks ago and no problems so far. I buy there and then send to my Trezor.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:50:23
I don't know about NYC, but the Bitcoin ATMs around here start at a minimum of about 6.7% in fees. Most of them are 10%+. Basically they are only good for a lot of money if you are a drug dealer and can't just put it in the bank.

@_date: 2019-07-14 19:24:32
I'm not the one you asked, but to answer number 2, no, they wouldn't cash everyone out. If they had the money to pay every out for their current value, they wouldn't be bankrupt.  It's possible you could make a claim to what they owe you, and get in line with everyone else they owe money to, but you definitely won't get everything you are owed.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:08:28
I'll use BTC as primary currency when it's accepted everywhere, easy to do, and cheap.  What's the problem with that? If I want to hodl, I can just buy more BTC with secondary currency.  A lot of places might even offer BTC discounts, so it would be cheaper that way as well.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:10:03
Nope. There are buttons and a screen on the wallet. So when I want to transfer money out of it, it will show the address on the wallet so I can confirm it with the one on my computer screen. That way if my computer is trying to send it somewhere else I can see the difference. And then the wallet will ask me if I want to confirm I am sending that amount to that address, and I press the button to confirm.
It also shows the address when receiving coin as well, so I know that it's going to my wallet address. So if I have a virus on my computer and it is changes the address that coins are being sent or received to, I will be able to know and cancel the transaction.
Honestly they are super simple to use and give great peace of mind. I'm very glad I got mine before I started buying any. If you are going to be buying any decent amount of crypto, definitely look into it. You can get one for less than $100.
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:27:55
Yes, but if I try every 12 words I see, I'm bound to eventually get a correct one! It's like free money! How has nobody done this before???

That's true about friends. But it also matters the value of what was given. I looked at a chart, and the original gift was worth anywhere from $150 to $4500, and I seriously doubt it was at the higher end. But even if it was, this "friend" gives a gift of a few thousand and now expects over a million back? Nah. Give him a few BTC and tell him to go away.

For me, I'm checking pretty often so I can buy more when it dips. I was late to the game and only got in recently. I didn't want to put all my money into it right away in case I missed a good dip. This weekend actually let me get some BTC at a bit cheaper than if I had went all in at the start.

If you can't find reviews, I'd say avoid it. Why take the risk when there are a bunch of sites that are confirmed legit? Even if it's going to save you a tiny amount, let other people take the risks, and when they review it and say it's safe then go ahead.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:36:52
Good on you for doing that. Big banks get away with so much because people don't want to go through the hassle of looking for a better one. They rely on people being compliant. If more people do what you did they might actually think about changing the way they operate.

I would do it if I got a discount for using bitcoin. But I'm not going to spend my bitcoin, pay a purchase fee, and then pay another fee when I want to replace the bitcoin I just spent. There is zero advantage to doing that.

The value of Bitcoin goes up when more people have it because that means more people are buying it. When more people are looking to buy it, then the exchanges can charge more. Same reason why when less people are looking to buy Bitcoin, the exchanges have to lower their prices to be able to sell it. Hope that makes sense, because it did in my head.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:20:49
It's definitely going to cause a lot of confusion as crypto gets more and more mainstream. I only started buying last month, and I wasn't sure about what relationship, if any, there was between the two. I knew it wasn't Bitcoin, but I thought it might be tied to it somehow. 
I can easily see people wanting to get into crypto because they hear about how much BTC is rising, and then they see bcash and how much cheaper it is. So they buy that instead thinking they are somehow buying something that is related to BTC, just cheaper.  
Now yes, these people SHOULD be doing their homework before buying it. But let's be realistic. A lot of people won't. And those people will have a bad experience with crypto because of it. If it happens to enough people, it could slow down mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:19:44
I'm Canadian and use Shakepay. Send them an interac e-transfer and it arrives within an hour and I can buy BTC right away. I don't know if the spread is better or worse, but it's quick and easy and I like it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:01:09
Also wanted to add that when more people own Bitcoin, the supply has to be divided up into smaller portions.  For example, if there were 100 coins in existence, but only 5 people owned them, that works out to 20 coins each, so each coin has smaller value. But now if 500 people own those 100 coins, they only get 0.2 each. So assuming each person held the same amount of "value" as before, each coin has a higher value.

Good for you for not backing down after they returned your money. Shitty businesses count on that, they want people to just go away after getting money back. But when you had to threaten police action just to get it back, then that seems like it wasn't just a mistake.

If you have more than a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin, you should think about getting a hardware wallet. If you have more than a thousand you should get one for sure. I have a Trezor and it was super easy to set up and use, and I was a noob at the time. It also shows the exact amount of confirmations.

@_date: 2019-11-05 06:16:13
No, a seed is not your password. It's basically the key to access your bitcoin across any wallet. So if you buy a Trezor (I have one, it's super simple to use, I was a noob when I started and had no issues), you will have both a pin and a seed.
The pin is like a password. You use it to access your Trezor to either receive or send bitcoin from it, or even just to look at how much you have on it.
The seed is only ever used if something happens to your Trezor. If you lose it, or it gets smashed, you can take your seed words and enter them into another Trezor or another wallet, and you will be able to access your coins. The seed is MUCH more important than the pin, although both are important.
If somebody happens to find out your pin, but you still have your physical device with you, you are safe. You can change your pin and no worries, your coins are fine. If somebody ever finds your seed phrase, you are fucked. Even though you have your Trezor with you, they can still access your coins and steal them. You never EVER give out your seed phrase.

"Don't all non-privacy coins like Bitcoin have a fatal flaw, in which the fact that all transactions are public, you're literally giving away everything regarding your financial situation? Given that it is a taboo today to even ask for a person's salary or wealth and money is a fairly looked down upon subject altogether, how and why would people even use money that would make it possible for "everyone" to know about everything you're doing financial-wise? "
Me sending somebody BTC doesn't give them access to all my BTC info. Not even close. I could send you $5 worth of BTC and you wouldn't even be able to see 5% of what I have. At all.

Hey, I'm far from a pro, but I think in that situation you would want more than 1 copy of your seed phrase.

10 out of 12 words is definitely possible to get them back. If you have an idea of what the words might be (length, or maybe a letter or two that is in it) even better. Seriously, do some research on brute forcing and get your coins back. There is also a legit guy I've heard about who will do it for you if you can give him enough of the information. He will take a percentage of the coins for a fee. But you are so damn close it's probably very possible to do it yourself.

Sounds like a scam to me. One of the biggest selling points of bitcoin is that it's trustless. I don't have to know or trust you that the bitcoin you send me is legit. I can look on the blockchain and see it's real. Or if I send it to you, I can look and know that it was received at the address I sent it to, whether you said it arrived or not.
Something like this, the way you described it, if you sent me one of these tokens that represents a Bitcoin, sounds like I have to trust that I can actually exchange it for a real one. Unless there is more to it, I would never use it. What's the point anyway? If I want to send a Bitcoin, I send one. Why bother getting a token that represents one and send that? Seems like added steps for no reason.
@_date: 2019-11-29 05:55:55

Did you look into the address it was changing to? I'm just curious how much coin, if any, was there. I wonder if malware like that would use the same address for every victim, or if it would keep using new addresses to make it harder to see how many people are getting scammed by it.
Also, thanks for posting this. I hate scammers so much, and people need to post stuff like this so other people can have a good idea of what to look for to keep from being scammed. You may have just saved people a lot of money for anybody who didn't already know about this scam.

I can't understand why anybody would listen to the scammer if somebody is there saying it's a scam.

I almost thought he was serious (just misinformed) until he said bring your money to the casino. The odds of losing it all at a casino are waaaay higher than the odds of bitcoin going to zero. And the odds of multiplying your money by 10x, 20x, or more at a casino? Get the fuck outta here. Even if you see bitcoin as just a gamble and not as the future of money, it still has much better odds than any casino will offer you.
@_date: 2019-11-04 03:41:40
Honestly, I still spend a few mins collecting from a couple faucets every couple days. It's almost worthless now, but if bitcoin moons, like we all hope it does, it will have been worth it. And it's usually time sitting at home after work where I wouldn't be doing anything anyway.
I also do surveys, which pay a lot better than just doing faucets. Made about $40 in a month. And I know it's legit and not fake numbers because I already have withdrawn to my Trezor.
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:57:50
If it's a scam, why would they cancel my order of 4, telling me there was an order limit of 1 per customer? Apparently there was a glitch (more likely somebody forgot to actually set a limit in the store) that allowed people to order more than one.

Some exchanges just have the spread, some will have both a spread and a fee. Different exchanges will also have different spreads as well. So the buy/sell might be 7950/8050 on one, but 7900/8100 on another. Just one of the things to look into when you're deciding on which exchange to use.
I've also seen some have a fee to buy, but also another fee if you want to withdraw your coins to your own wallet. So there are a lot of things to look for.

"Then how do you make money off it? Just hold on to it and sell when price increases?"
Yes, that's the best and safest way to make money with it. People will say they can invest it for you, but it's all a scam.
"What do you know about localbitcoin.com to buy BTC and find a safer wallet to keep the BTC? "
I've never used localbitcoin.com, but I've heard both good and bad. If you find an honest seller on there it's good, but there are also scammers on there who want to steal your money. I wouldn't suggest it for a newcomer. Your safest bet is to just find an exchange that works in your area. You will have to verify your ID, but as long as you use a known exchange you won't get scammed. If you are in Canada I would recommend Shakepay. In the US a lot of people seem to recommend Coinbase Pro. Other than that you'll have to do some research.
The safest wallets are hardware wallets, like Trezor or Ledger. But those cost money, so if you just want a couple hundred $ worth of bitcoin, I wouldn't recommend them. I use a Trezor so I can't recommend a software wallet for you, but if you just do a search you will find many posts asking for suggestions, and find one there.

Some of these companies are scams. And the rest of them are "scams".
The outright scams will take your money, tell you how great you're doing, and your profits are huge, and you should invest more money. Then your "profits" get bigger and bigger, while they tell you to invest more and more. Then when you finally say to yourself "well, I'm up $500k in 3 months with an initial investment of only $32k. I think it's time to cash out." Now they will tell you there is a "processing fee", or a "withdrawal fee", or some other fee to get your money. And you are already up almost half a million! What's another $1k? Or maybe $5k? Or maybe $10k? So you pay that. And then you get silence. Or maybe another email about another fee. What you don't get is your money. Ever. It's gone and you got scammed. They might string you along for a while, but it's gone. Too bad.
The other companies are "scams". They will rent out mining time on real mining machines. You will sign a nice contract telling you how much money you'll make. So you pay them, and they mine for you. And hey, they actually pay you. Month after month, they pay you your "profits". Minus their processing, and energy, and storage fees of course. But you get paid! And after a year, you've been paid $10k! And you only invested $9k! So that's a real life $1k profit! But you're so happy, you never sit down to actually look at the numbers. If you had taken that $9k and just used it to buy bitcoin at the start of the year, when the price was only $3k, it would have got you 3BTC. And after that year, that 3 BTC would now be worth $22.5k. So yeah, you didn't get scammed, but you got "scammed", because the company you rented the miner from knew exactly what they were doing. They profited a lot more off your mining time than they did.
The days of the little guy making a lot of easy money from Bitcoin mining are long gone. You won't make money from it, you'll probably lose money. If you want to get involved in Bitcoin, just buy some instead.

The title is incorrect. This isn't about buying and selling, it's about day trading. You can buy and sell crypto with being a trader trying to beat the market. I have some better golden rules for buying crypto.
1. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
2. Research your exchange. Don't use one just because it promises the best rates. Great rates mean nothing if they don't let you withdraw your coins.
3. Research your wallet. There are enough legit wallets that you have no excuses if you use a scam one that steals your coins.
4. Not your keys, not your coins.
5. Don't try to mine, it's not worth it.
6. You cant predict the market, so don't try.
7. HODL.

I agree that most people won't sift. Majority of people don't need to have the "best" wallet. They just want a good one that works and isn't difficult for beginners.
I think a bigger hurdle is the massive amount of scams. Seems this sub can't go 2 days without a newbie asking if some site or some wallet is legit or not. People don't want to have to figure out if they are about to be scammed, they just want it to be safe without having to research it.

When you buy bitcoin on Robinhood, you're not actually buying Bitcoin. You're buying an IOU for the value of Bitcoin. When you actually buy Bitcoin, you are able to withdraw it from the exchange and hold it in your own wallet, do whatever you want with it, but you can't do that when you buy on Robinhood.
That's the point of OPs comment, that because you can't withdraw the Bitcoin you buy from those exchanges, you should avoid them.

If I was in your position I would probably do the exact same thing. I say it's a smart move even. Sure you could put that money somewhere for a pathetic couple percent interest, and then when you come back you have a bit of money. But why do that when your situation lets you take the risk and have a potential huge payout? The fact that you're young means you have plenty of time to recover if it goes south.
Go for it man, and good luck.

The days of people turning a few hundred/thousand dollars into millions are gone. They are done and over. If you missed that boat, too bad (don't worry, a lot of us did, including me).  However, this doesn't mean bitcoin can't be a solid investment that does very well for you.  
There is still a chance for great reward though, but it also comes with a lot of risk. Bitcoin is still far from a sure thing. So don't pump all your money into it thinking it's guaranteed to make you rich. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Luckily because you're young, if you want to take the risk, if you go bust you still have a lot of time to make that money back.
Also keep an eye out for scams. You'll have people telling you about great ways to invest in crypto with amazing returns, and it might seem legit because in the past people turned a few thousand into a few million, but again, those days are over. Anybody who tells you about an investment that makes you super excited because it's going to make you rich in a few months or a year? They are scamming you, and you'll only lose money. Anybody DMs you out of the blue about crypto, it's a scam, every time.
Do your research, stay smart, not your keys not your coins, and welcome to the club.

Why do they have to sell them on a public exchange? Private sales a a thing.
Also, the wallet isn't public, the address is.
It's not like the hacker is going to take $1 million that they stole and send it in one transaction to an exchange to sell. They will break it up into smaller more manageable pieces. And they will send them through multiple addresses so you can no longer know who owns the address.
So say it's been broken down, and some bitcoin worth $1k arrives in an address. That coin is clearly from the hack, but what happens when $1k that is completely clean now arrives in the address? How do you determine what's from the hack now? If that $2k is again split into $1k again and sent to two addresses, which is from the hack? You can just blacklist any coins that come into contact with coins from a hack, because then the hacker can just send coins around to random addresses and blacklist completely innocent people. Or send coins to an exchange wallet and now the exchanges coins are dirty.
It's very complicated and there is no easy solution. You can't just say blacklist and that fixes the problem.

"OP, think about how you would go about writing your own scam to steal someone else's Bitcoin. Really think about it."
I think part of the issue is most people out there aren't shitty, scamming, immoral, trash people. So even though once you talk about it, it does seem like an obvious way to scam people, I think that many people wouldn't come up with that on their own because they aren't that type of person.
Combine that with the fact that bitcoin is still a new technology that majority of people don't understand, and it makes a lot of scams seem almost plausible to a lot of people.

Let's pretend the price of BTC is 8000 euros. When you want to buy from an exchange, they will show that the current price of bitcoin is 8k. But then when you want to actually buy some coin, the cost you pay will be 8050 euros (not real pricing, just using that as an example). If you wanted to sell bitcoin to them, the cost they pay you would be 7950 euros. That difference between the buy and sell pricing is called the spread, and it is how exchanges make their money. So when the price is 8k, and one user sells 1 Bitcoin to you, you will pay the 8050, and the seller receives 7950, and the exchange keeps the 100 euro difference for themselves.
@_date: 2019-11-20 10:45:55
That's really cool, I like it.  As bitcoin becomes worth more, it will be worth it for thieves to invest the money to manufacture their own tamper proof materials and boxes, so after they break into a shipment they can replace it. This is a pretty good deterrent to that.

The thing is, as of right now it hasn't been long enough to be sure that any coins other than ones at a burn address are actually lost. There could be people still hodling coins from 8 years ago. So it will be a long time before we can really say we know which coins are lost.
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:18:48
I know you said about following the bitcoin from address to address, and it remains "black", but there is no real way to do that. Let's say address x receives 1 Bitcoin from a tainted address. It already had 4 Bitcoin in the address and now has 5. It then sends 1 Bitcoin to 5 new addresses, a b c d and e. Which address now has the tainted one? The first? The last? Is it split evenly? Then those addresses send 0.2btc to 5 addresses each. But all those addresses already had some bitcoin. What now? Eventually you're either blacklisting an address that received 1% of a tainted coin from many transactions ago, or you're blacklisting addresses that just happened to be sent the coin first (or last) from a tainted one, while other addresses get off free.
None of it really works in a reasonable manner.

Get a hardware wallet. Put it in a small safe and lose the combination. Wrap small safe in 4 inches of duct tape. Encase duct taped safe in 6 inches of concrete.

Please don't rely on only having the seed memorized. If you are in an accident, and receive head trauma, you might lose that seed and if you don't have a backup it is gone forever.
You need to have a physical copy somewhere, although your situation might make that difficult. You probably don't want to bring it with you because if you get robbed then they have your money. Maybe try to figure out a way you can leave it with people you trust, or hide it somewhere but have it in code so if it's found it will be useless.

The physical wallet is a definite no, and him saying he will help show somebody the coins are in their wallet, idk why but it made me think of him setting up the wallet and having access to it, then showing them it on the person's phone. A newcomer could think because it's on their phone only they can control it.
Guy could be totally legit, but I don't like a couple of things he said.

Buy the dip IS good advice though.
Also wanted to add, might be too late now, but next time you do a giveaway for the crypto community, maybe make one of the rules be that the winner has to have previously made a comment in one of the crypto subs. I think it's awesome what you are doing, I just think it would kind of suck if people who don't care at all about crypto found out about the contest and came to enter just for the free watch.

"Can't I just create a wallet offline, write down its seed and delete it before going online?"
I guess you could do that. And if you are only buying, and want to send it to the same address every time, that would work. But if you want to use your crypto at all, or use multiple addresses to receive, it would be a hassle. Although I guess you could write down a bunch of addresses before you delete your wallet. But make sure you don't make any mistakes writing them down, or typing them in again.
"What happens if the Trezor breaks down? I need to have my seed somewhere, either in paper or encrypted on my disk."
You have a 24 word seed for your Trezor. If it breaks, you still have access.
"What if someone steals my Trezor device? Is the 4-digit pin the only thing keeping him from accessing my funds?"
You can use up to a 9 digit pin. And every time a wrong pin is entered, it locks for a longer and longer amount of time. After 15 incorrect attempts, the device wipes itself. So they can't just brute force it. And then you use your seed words to retrieve your coins.
"Thus, isn't a normal wallet just as good as trezor for me?"
If you are 100% sure your wallet will never be compromised, then sure. I'd rather not take that risk. Even if my computer has malware on it, it won't be able to access my coins. That peace of mind is worth the less than $100 the device cost. If you are great with computers and can make sure your devices are safe, then maybe that cost isn't worth it for you, I'm not an expert so the cost is worth it to me.

And the more acceptance Bitcoin gets, the more we will see stuff like this. Imagine how bad it will be once we get to a time where it's normal for the elderly to have crypto. They are already a huge target for scammers, and once they carry any crypto they will be an even bigger target.
It saddens me when I see people on here put 100% of the blame on the victim, saying they shouldn't have been stupid and should have protected themselves. Yes, people need to keep themselves safe, but if it wasn't for the scammers those people wouldn't be in such danger. And it's not always stupid careless people who are victims to these. Somebody can be safe 99.99% of the time, but they make one small mistake one time and they deserve to lose all their crypto? Or even if somebody is stupid and careless, does their entire family deserve to go hungry because of that? Kids can't help it if their parents screw up. The blame should always be put on the scammer, while still trying to educate the users to protect themselves. I think it's a benefit to all of us if scammers aren't able to operate so easily because there is more information on how to be safe.

All good. Basically anything promising daily or weekly or promising ANY gains is going to be a scam. There is no guaranteed profit with bitcoin, nobody can predict if it's going up or down.
 I have read a couple things about sites that will lend out your bitcoin for you and pay interest on it, but you're looking at around 5% a YEAR, not weekly or daily. Plus, you don't control your coins if you do that, so if the price jacks up and you want to sell quickly, they have control and maybe don't give them back. I'd rather just be safe and keep mine.

I get that, but how is somebody going to get bitcoin in the first place if they don't know anybody who will sell them some?

Don't buy/keep a coin just because you think the price will rise. Do it because you have looked into the coin, and like what it offers that others don't offer. If the only positive about a coin is that it might make you money, that coin probably isn't going anywhere.

People value their privacy, but just because you value it doesn't mean you will never ever sell it.
For $100? No thanks, I'll keep it. But when you are talking buying and hodling, and long term, and you believe Bitcoin will rise greatly in 10 years, that's a lot of money. So if I'm going to spend 13% more in fees for an ATM, that value in 10 years could be $100k. So yeah, while I value my privacy, I'll sell it for $100k.

I hope this experience hasn't completely put you off cryptocurrency. There is a learning curve to it, so if you want to try again in the future you should educate yourself somewhat before any money gets involved. It doesn't take a lot to learn the basics and get comfortable with it, I only started buying a bit over a month ago. But I'm still learning new things and there is a lot I don't know. I've found r/Bitcoinbeginners is a great source of information, because other people will ask questions you didn't even know you had. And people there can point you in the right direction of a site or video that can teach you the basics.
No offense to r/Bitcoin, but I've found r/Bitcoinbeginners to be a better place to learn for a newbie.  While the majority of users here are very helpful and will answer any questions, there are a minority who will make rude comments or talk down to people for asking a question, and that doesn't happen at the other sub.

With all the shady exchanges out there it shouldn't be surprising when tons of people recommend a good one.

Also, it says no fees, but that doesn't matter if they have a huge spread.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:25:12
Another vote for don't mine. It's long past the point of being profitable for a person just messing around in their home. You are going to spend more money on equipment and electricity than you will get out of mining. Better off to just take that money and buy bitcoin with it.
And I'll throw in another vote for Trezor as well. I'm a Bitcoin newcomer and I found it very simple to set up and use. Definitely think about getting one if you are going to be investing more than a few hundred bucks.
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:51:11
I can't compare the two because I only have one. That said, I only got into crypto about a month ago, and I have a Trezor. It's super easy to set up and use, I think it's great. You can't go wrong with either, I've heard, but I do really like my Trezor.
@_date: 2019-08-10 08:23:51
Any time you send Bitcoin, there is a transaction fee that takes a tiny bite out of it. So if you send 0.01 Bitcoin, only 0.00999 will arrive at the destination (as an example, not the real cost). The fee goes to the miners that make it all possible, because they aren't doing this for free.
Any time you buy Bitcoin from an exchange, they might say no fee, but they charge a spread. So you see Bitcoin is at $10 000 and you want to buy, they will actually charge you $10 100 (again just an example, not real numbers).
So if you buy from an exchange and have it sent to your own wallet, first they hit you with the spread, and then the transaction fee when they send it to your wallet. You set out to buy $10, and end up with $9.28. It's how it all works, so either accept that and hold on to your coins because you believe in the end the price will go up enough to cover those costs, or stop buying bitcoin.

Get a hardware wallet to store your coins.
Contact your bank ahead of time to let them know you'll be buying crypto so they hopefully won't try to freeze any transfers. I think this really depends on the bank, some are ok with it, some aren't. I'm sure you could search online to find out for your bank.
I don't use coinbase, so I can't help you there. Although from what I have read on here, dealing with smaller amounts seems to have less issues. Or at least people don't post about the issues with smaller amounts. If you don't want to use them though, you have options. If you're in Canada I'd suggest Shakepay. If you're not in Canada you'll have to ask somebody else.

Of course they will be worth something, as long as bitcoin is still around. Or by "worth something" do you mean worth a lot? Because then that all depends on how much a bitcoin is worth. Right now 100 sats is worth a bit more than a penny. In 50 years is that going to be worth $10,000? Probably not. But depending on how high Bitcoin goes could it be worth $100? Maybe.

That's definitely true for some of them. But when you look at the massive list of altcoins, most of them were definitely a greed thing. Especially all the ones that were only created after bitcoin started to take off.

I don't know how much BTC you have (and I don't care so don't tell me, never tell anyone) but if it's getting close to $1000 or more, I'd say just go for a Trezor. It's not just for hodling. Even if you are buying and selling, unless you're doing that every day, it's safer to take your coins off the exchange while you wait to sell. Even if you have a wallet on your computer, a virus could wipe that out and take your coins. With a Trezor even if your computer has a virus it will protect your coins, you can send them without physically pressing buttons on the device.
I guess it all comes down to whether you think $100 is worth it to protect your coins. If you'd rather take the risk, that's a valid decision, just that for me I gladly paid so I could have peace of mind and not worry about a hack or a virus.

Also want to add, if you have specific questions, you can ask at r/Bitcoinbeginners and they will help you there. You can definitely ask here, and most people here are happy to help out, but you'll find a few here and there who get all salty when newbies ask questions.
Most importantly, NEVER respond to any DMs about crypto. They are always scammers. They will pretend to help you out, and steal your coins. Any questions you have should be answered out in the open, where other people can see it.

Yes, they technically work and mine, but when you factor in your costs vs the money you get out of it, it's practically a scam. You will not make tens of thousands of dollars by investing a few thousand, or even ten thousand. All that will happen is you will pay a bunch of money up front, and by the time you also factor in added fees and electricity charges, you'll be lucky if you made more than a few hundred bucks in a year. Just buy Bitcoin and hodl it.

I don't think there will be widespread adoption until the price is much more stable. Just a steady 3-5% growth a year. Before that many places will accept Bitcoin, but they won't be pricing items on the shelves in Bitcoin. You will go to pay for your items, and the cashier will accept BTC at whatever the current exchange rate is. You probably won't see BTC prices on the shelves until the dollar has completely gone away.

Never buy bitcoin from somewhere where you can't obtain actual ownership of the coins. What happens if the price of Bitcoin shoots up, but they just decide they don't agree with that price, and only off to buy it back at a big discount? You're stuck because you don't own the coins. Sure, that could happen other places too, but at least at other places you can remove your Bitcoin, then if they start to get shady you can take them somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:23:40
No no no. Absolutely not. Make $100 a day using only $25? Not gonna happen. And if he wants access to your bank account, there is definitely something shady going on, even if there will only be $25 in it.
I'm not expert, so I don't know what the actual scam is, but it is one. Maybe he will use access to an account in your name to steal your identity, or open up more accounts or a line of credit? Either way, if something looks too good to be true, 99.99999% of the time it is, and the other 0.00001% of the time is because you're having a coma dream and it's not actually happening.
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:09:58
Good for you! Gotta start somewhere.
Now, you didn't "screw up" by choosing Coinbase, but it is more for buying/selling Bitcoin and not for holding. Of course, you can hold there if you want to, but many of us don't hold on an exchange because you don't control the private keys of your Bitcoin when it's held in an exchange wallet. If the exchange gets hacked you can lose your bitcoin.
Now it's no rush to get it off there, so spend some time to look into some wallets, and also learn about private keys so you know why it's important to control them yourself. Then when you pick a wallet just send it to that one.

@_date: 2019-10-12 17:08:27
I don't think you could buy a single sat, just because the value is so low. It's less than 100 sats is equal to 1 cent. So if you can find a place to buy one somehow, I guess you could, but it would be pointless.
Now if you just want to buy small amounts, like $5 or $10 worth, you can definitely do that. Look into exchanges that work in your area. Make sure you research them and don't just pick the first one, so you know it is legit.
You can leave your bitcoin on the exchange, for example leave it on CashApp, but many of us don't like to do that because then we don't control the private keys, and if the exchange is hacked we could lose our coins.
I don't know your knowledge level, but there is a lot to learn before jumping into buying some Bitcoin. Take a few days and read up on it. If you have any specific  questions about something, I suggest asking on r/Bitcoinbeginners instead of here. There are plenty of good people here who will help, but there are also jerks who will treat you like an idiot for not knowing something.
Perhaps my most important tip, absolutely NEVER accept help from somebody in a DM. They are always scammers. They will pretend to help you and then steal your coins. Only accept help out in the open on a post where everyone else can see it.

If you're doing this at her request, you should be passing the fees on to her. So if you would normally pay her $1000, but it costs you 3% to change that into BTC, only send her $970 worth of BTC.

Hey Sept isn't so bad. I started buying at the start of June, and kept buying as the price went up. So at least for you, the price is dropping and you can add more at a cheaper price. I just bought a bit more right now and it's the lowest price I have been able to buy at.
If you're in it for the long term, dips are good because you can buy at a discount and lower your average price.

Hopefully this isn't too off topic. It has to do with stablecoins. But also bitcoin that's why I'm asking it.
So I understand the point about stablecoins is they are stable and the price doesn't fluctuate so much. Now let's say in a couple years bitcoin shoots way up, like $100k+. Now that it's up so much, many people want to keep their money in crypto, but don't want to lose it all when the bubble pops. So they trade it all for a stablecoin. Now with so much money going into stablecoins, how do they stay stable? Wouldn't supply and demand make it go up like anything else?
Also, what happens when the bubble pops, Bitcoin nosedives, and now everybody wants to sell their stablecoins for Bitcoin again. With everyone trying to offload all these coins, how can the price not drop? Who is going to buy them all when everyone is selling instead of buying?
Thanks for any help. I've just been wondering about this because I was thinking about what I would do if bitcoin shot up in price really quickly.

Back when I was poor, but not 100% broke, I'd try to make it a point to spend my change as little as possible. At the end of the week I'd put it in a jar and forget about it. Doing that, once Comic Con came around each year I'd turn it into bills, and have some money to spend instead of being able to afford the tickets and nothing else. Was able to get a good $200+ to have fun with.
Now that I have a half decent job and don't have to save up for events I want to go to, I have all this spare change out of habit. I think I'm going to have to start buying BTC with it now. Hodl and stack those sats!

It's all like that. When you buy it from an exchange you just enter the dollar value, and it sells you that amount in Bitcoin. So if I want to buy $100 CDN worth, I just put in $100 and it gives me 0.0089 BTC.

On Shakepay you can use interac e-transfers for up to $10k. I don't know if there's a daily limit. For wire transfer, it doesn't say any limit, just $1k minimum. So maybe check that out. I don't use it for anywhere close to that amount, but for my smaller amounts it works great.

You don't need to leave anything in the wallet. I'm assuming you are talking about covering the transaction fee? That fee is taken from the amount sent, not from the wallet. So send a small amount first to make sure you have the address entered correctly, then just send the rest.

I don't know how true this is, it's just what I have read before. Coinbase only insures the amount of USD you have in their exchange, not the entire value of the crypto you are holding.  So you send $1000USD to Coinbase, and use $500 to buy some bitcoin, and just hold the other $500USD because maybe you think bitcoin will dip. If coinbase gets hacked and your entire account is drained, only the $500 that is still USD is insured, and you are out the other $500.  Again, just what I've read, I don't use Coinbase so I haven't done research on it, so if you want to hold some serious coin on there I suggest doing your own research.
Also, I've found Coinbase is very popular here, but only as a method of buying bitcoin, not to hold it. Many people here use Coinbase to buy, and then immediately transfer to their hardware wallet, which is your safest bet. If you're going to be buying more than a couple thousand dollars of Bitcoin, I'd suggest getting a hardware wallet.

If you bought them from a legit exchange they are clean. If you bought them from another person or maybe slightly sketchy exchange, you should use a coin tumbler to clean them.

@_date: 2019-08-12 12:59:17
Definitely watch that video. It's clear from your questions that your completely new at this, and that's ok, but you need to learn a bit before you dive in.
Also, just a tip, if anybody EVER messages you about investing with them in bitcoin, it's a SCAM. You might think you won't get fooled, but it happens to people every day. Especially if they aren't completely sure how crypto works. They will message you and talk about how if you invest X amount, they can give you 20% profit every month, or week, or DAY. So people see those insane numbers, and they stop being able to think clearly. Don't get sucked in. If it sounds so great that you get excited over the opportunity, it's a damn scam.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:49:10
Especially since a lot can happen in 10 years. I don't know this guy's situation, but if he's worried about spending it he's probably not so well off that money problems are just not going to happen.
Put it away for 10 years, and a few bad things in a row happen and that money could have been a huge difference. Say something unexpected happens that eats up all your savings. Not so bad, right? Still have a job, can recover. But then driving to work your car blows it's engine. Now you have no car, and your job isn't on a bus route. Already struggling, it's going to be hard to pay for an Uber/cab to work every day. Late getting to work one too many times and get fired. Now you're SOL. Could have cashed in some or all of that BTC to buy a car to get to work, but wanted to make sure to HODL it for 10 years. Now have to take a worse job, blah blah blah, everything goes to Hell. You're so poor and depressed by the time 10 years is up, that when you finally get your coin you waste it all on hookers and blow. And then die. Idk. Maybe a bit extreme, but it CAN happen. Best to just have some self control and keep the coin available for emergencies.

In the future, do not deal with ANY person who private messages you. It's always a scam. That's why they private message you, so nobody can see it and tell you it's a scam. I don't care if it's the damn pope and he can prove it with a selfie. A private message = scam.
Hopefully somebody else can see this and stop themselves from getting scammed.
Also, try not to beat yourself up over it too much. You're not the first to fall for it, and you definitely won't be the last. These scumbags have trained themselves to be able to talk to people and sound normal.

I've looked into the ATMs around me before I decided against them. On those ones it would either show a QR code you could scan, or it would print out a paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:26:03
Your phone will be fine. You don't need a great one to buy BTC. You might be thinking about mining, which takes a lot of computer power, and isn't something you want to get into because there is no money to be made doing it unless you have a very large operation.
Because you're new I'd suggest sticking to an exchange at first, that way you don't have to worry about getting scammed buying it from a person. Also the Bitcoin ATMs are easy to use but have very high fees. If you are in the USA, I see a lot of people recommending CashApp or Coinbase Pro for buying. I'm not in the USA so I don't know which exchanges are available there, and can't recommend one.
@_date: 2019-08-10 09:10:58
If you're going to invest more money than you would care about losing, look into buying a hardware wallet for your coins. If you keep them on an exchange you are in a greater danger of losing them to a hack.
Also, if you have a lot of questions check out r/Bitcoinbeginners for help. A lot of your questions have probably already been asked there, and they are always happy to help out newbies. Most people here are happy to help as well, but some don't like it too much when people ask too many simple questions, lol.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:54:39
Really? Because I'm sure there are places you can buy much cheaper than 50%. Even the most expensive bitcoin ATM in my city is only about 18%. My guess would be that this guy has an account on there to buy bitcoin at 50%, postshere so people think it's legit, then he'll do a chargeback with PayPal.

@_date: 2019-10-23 16:41:31
Gotta stay positive or I'd just be freaking out and sell my coins for a loss, lol.
It also helps that this investment isn't a make or break thing for me. I'm not rich, or even well off, I just spend very little money. My city has a low enough cost of living, I got a new job last year that will be long term, and I've grown out of my days of blowing money on drugs/partying. So now I have a bunch of extra money that otherwise would just be sitting in a bank earning me almost nothing. I'm also young enough that if this Bitcoin thing crashes, I can still save enough for retirement that it won't be a huge factor. But if it does do the moon thing, that's just a bonus on everything. Even if it doesn't moon but still does well, I can take those profits and do something else with it.
So yeah, I'm not worried, and every time it dips I am happy because I get to buy some on sale.
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:02:32
Every time he makes a sale, have him send the money to me, and then I'll send him BTC.

It's amusing to think of every bitcoin transaction being done in whole bitcoins. Go order some coke off the dark web, only option is to buy a kilo.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:11:49
What exactly do you see the problem being though? Yes, it's finite and some will be lost forever, but so what? You don't need a full Bitcoin, that's what the sats are for. As more people get into Bitcoin, the sats are more valuable. And if the day ever comes where a sat is too valuable to use in day to day life, if will be broken down further, into millisats or whatever. So there is no problem. There is enough supply for everybody.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:04:18
Ok, but then you would also need a wallet that lets you try to send more BTC than you have, which I don't think any wallet would let you do. So... Sounds like a scam.

So that instead of having your coins spread out among many addresses in your wallet, it is all in one address. That way when you want to send bitcoin further in the future, it doesn't have to take coins from multiple addresses. Using less addresses for a transaction means a smaller transaction size, which means less transaction fees. Hope this makes sense, let me know if something doesn't and I'll try to explain better.
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:36:22

@_date: 2019-10-04 16:22:51
There is a transaction fee every time you send Bitcoin. It varies depending on how much you set the fee to (sats per byte) and how big your transaction is (in bytes, not BTC value). Usually when sending from an exchange to your own wallet they set the fee on their own, and it will be a bit higher to make sure it arrives quickly. When sending from most wallets you can set the fee.
Also, the fee isn't a lot. If it's a small transaction it will be less than a dollar.
Edit to add: I'm no expert, so hopefully this answers your questions. If you have more questions, you should head over to r/Bitcoinbeginners and ask there. A lot of knowledgeable people who want to help out newbies, I've learned a lot of my info from there.

That's a crazy situation. Sucks for the people involved, I'm just glad I'm in a position where I was able to put some money into bitcoin so I don't have to rely on banks if something like that ever happens here.

The problem with your idea is that there is no way to make everyone do things the right way. First of all, who decides when to do it? There is no way I'd trust some internet random to not buy a bunch of coins first, and then tell everybody "ok, we are buying now." Since they had the info first, they will benefit by getting the cheapest coins. And then you will have more people, whether it's the guy who said to buy or not, who will use this opportunity to buy a bunch, wait for the price to rise, and then sell it all for a profit while everyone else is holding. Now they are benefiting off the work of everyone by not playing along.
I would never get involved in something like this, because while it might benefit me slightly, others will benefit much more on the back of my money.

Keep in mind that exchanges will track where any bitcoin you send them has come from. So for some exchanges if you receive Bitcoin from a gambling website or from "nefarious" things, and then send it to the exchange, they will ban your account. There are was to avoid this, but it's too complicated to describe quickly so just look up coin tumbling.
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:40:18
I first heard of bitcoin when it was around $1, so fucking right there are regrets, lol. I first looked into buying some when it was around $30-40 because I wanted to try out Silk Road. But I never really looked into the details of what it was until this year.
So while I regret it, it's not that big of a deal to me. Sitting around crying and boohooing because I'm not a millionaire isn't going to change anything about my life. Not going to let a past mistake control my state of mind.

I agree. If tomorrow we started talking about sats, the vast majority of people out there won't know what that is. All they will know is that Bitcoin used to cost $7k, and now you get a hundred units for a penny. They won't take the time to figure out how many sats in a bitcoin. They will just know it was expensive and now it's not.
I do think it will change over time, but there is no reason to try to rush it. Let it happen naturally and that will be the best outcome for all.

That's a good point, probably true. They have seen it a few times already so they want to get out while they can. I wonder if there will be less trading happening in the lead up to Jan 3, due to people pulling their BTC off the exchanges.
One shitty thing is that most of the people holding the bag of failed exchanges will probably be newer users who don't know what happened in the past.

I'll fully admit that I haven't read up much on these situations, but I recall that in most cases people/companies who get their data hacked and held for ransom will get it back after paying in the majority of cases.

No worries. Pretty much if it looks too good to be true, it is. The days of turning a couple thousand dollars into millions are long gone, but scammers count on people who are new not knowing this. Also, only buy from well known sources. There are plenty of real exchanges, so there is no reason to risk your money on some obscure exchange just because it saves you a few dollars in fees.
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:23:53
I don't think there is any way to make a bitcoin buying group big enough to actually affect the price and still prevent this from happening. There will always be people who don't play by the rules (even if those rules are just made up by a BTC group) in an effort to benefit themselves at the cost of others.
The best way for the people to win is to spread adoption and let the price grow organically, imo. Give it time and it will happen, I don't think it needs any help.

"And just focusing on the issue of scammers, at what point does a scheme become a scam?"
It becomes a scam when the only intention is to lie to people to steal their money with no intention of following through with your end of the bargain. You could argue that most of the altcoins are "schemes" because they are created for the most part just to hop on the crypto bandwagon and make money. But even most alt coins at least attempt to follow through with what they hope to accomplish with new uses or whatever. An alt coin is a scam if the creators has no intention of keeping up with it, just does their ICO and then fucks off with the money.  This YouTube scam OP posted is clearly a scam because they lie about what they are doing, they have zero intention of sending bitcoin back to anybody.
"Should we protect people from gambling - lotteries, scratchcards, etc etc. They exploit human weakness as much as any outright scam does, so should advertising any form of gambling become illegal? "
Again, those aren't scams because, while unlikely, you CAN win. Nobody is being lied to. They aren't selling scratch tickets that say "top prize of $50,000" but in reality no prize is over $100. Most people don't understand how long their chances really are, but that chance is still legitimately there. On these YouTube scams there is ZERO chance of getting any money back, so it's a scam.
I wish everybody was smart enough it be able to spot these scams and never fall for them, but unfortunately that's not the case. I don't think it's a nanny state to make it illegal to outright steal from people just because they couldn't spot a scam. And most of the people who fall for scams are the most vulnerable. Elderly people need to be protected because they aren't always there mentally or have somebody in their life who can help them out (he'll, sometimes the elderly are scammed by the people who are supposed to be helping them). Somebody who grew up in poverty through no fault of their own shouldn't be targeted just because they had shitty parents and went to an underfunded school that didn't teach them critical thinking skills.
To me it's a pretty easy answer when we are talking about those situations. Now if you want to talk about shitty businesses that take advantage of people, like MLMs or door to door salespeople who sell a real but absolute garbage product, then it gets into a more grey area. People get screwed over but it's not outright theft.  Making those things illegal would be a nanny state thing imo.

I've heard some exchanges don't like to accept Bitcoin from gambling sites. I haven't done it myself but you should be very careful to make sure you don't lose your coins.
My suggestion is to absolutely do NOT try to withdraw it all at once. Do it in small batches of maybe around $500. It will take a lot longer, but that way if the exchange tries to get shitty you will only have $500 at risk instead of the entire thing. And that means only send $500 to the exchange, then withdraw that $500 to your bank, and only after you have received the money would you send more.
You will have to find from somebody else which exchange might be more gambling friendly.
Also wanted to add that it's awesome that you won! I used to play a ton of poker but never got up to that amount of money. Congrats!

And one wallet can have multiple addresses (thousands, actually). So when you're moving it around to practice, you just send it to another address in the wallet you own. Doing this will also give you an idea of the transaction fees it will cost.

"You have a tremendous opportunity to cut expenses and make a budget and a life plan."
This is so true. I had a rough couple years a little while back. I was on either unemployment or welfare for most of it. Before that happened, I was living paycheque to paycheque. I wasn't making a ton, but it's not like I was getting minimum wage either. But those couple years made me figure out how to not spend so much money on stupid shit. Used to get fast food or delivery at least 4-5 times a week, now we get pizza once a week (and on the day where it's all 50% off), and maybe order delivery once a month other than that. Cut out going to bars and wasting money on booze and drugs. Got rid of satellite tv (well, it got cut off because we couldn't afford it) and now I don't even want it back because it was such a huge cost and I'd sit there watching bullshit just to have something on the tv. Even changed cell phone companies to one that's almost half the cost.
Now that I've been working again, instead of wasting money on all that crap and having nothing to show for it, I'm able to save a large chunk of my pay. So in the end, I think it really was a good thing that it happened.

If people knew how many silent vegans they cam across, there would be a much better opinion of vegans as a whole. The reason many people generally dislike vegans is because the only ones they hear about are the super vocal ones who also insult anybody who isn't vegan.
And with bitcoin, I only know 2 people in my life that are into crypto at all. Both are at work, and the one guy only brought it up once when I asked if he was into it, and the other guy talks about it with me a couple times a week for maybe 5 mins. Not exactly cult levels here. Maybe I'm just lucky with the ones I've met, but I think you are correct that most are pretty silent about it.

People would literally throw thousands of BTC in the garbage. I bet if you compare the actual value at the time of the coins lost now vs then, probably losing is more costly now, because when people fuck up it's thousands of dollars compared to back then when it was 10s of dollars.

It might be ok because your xrp is still there, or they might be waiting you out, hoping that you'll deposit a larger amount for them to steal.
When I got my Trezor, while doing the set up instructions it even says that if the box was tampered with to contact them immediately. Personally I wouldn't trust it with any more crypto than the cost of a new one.

I definitely FOMO'd at that time. I had started planning on buying my first bitcoin around March, but I'm a lazy idiot so I kept putting it off. I finally got my account verified and bought my Trezor in June. I was seeing how fast the price was rising that I was worried I'd miss out on a cheaper price and that this might be on its way to a new ATH. I was putting my investment money into bitcoin faster than I should have, I wasn't DCAing like a smart lad. Aaaand then it dropped back down, lol. So I'm definitely losing money right now, but I'm also hodling and not selling. And now I buy every time it dips to try to get my average price as low as I can.
I know I missed out big time by procrastinating, and it most likely won't drop to March levels again. But meh, I'm into it now and that's what matters.

When you factor in the cost of everything, including time, I don't think bitcoin is valuable enough yet to make it worth it. Pretty much just like a lottery.

Since you're new I'll give you the newbie advice. Others have already told you that you can't make money mining, and that includes cloud mining or mining services.
Any "investment" that promises to bring you great profits is a scam. There is no magical Bitcoin investing that earns you 50% a month, a week, or a day. Not even a year. It's all a scam, so any time somebody comes to you with a great investment opportunity, it's a scam.
Also, any website that gives you free Bitcoin but you have to "verify" by first depositing some Bitcoin before you can withdraw, scam. Every one.
The only way to make any money is to buy some Bitcoin, wait for the price to go up, and then sell it. That's it. Don't get greedy and lose all your money.

Right. It's a similar situation to the pirates off the African coast who hijack ships and demand ransom. If they didn't return the ship's after ransom was paid, there would be no incentive to pay it. It's a business transaction, they don't actually want the ship's, just like the hackers don't actually want the data.

I would, but I'm poor. And then I'd use 0.2 BTC to get it covered up by the guy who does my tattoos.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:33:47
And even if you didn't sell at that point, there's a pretty good chance you would have sold well before $20k. Not many people can resist selling when you bought at $75 and then it hits $1k.
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:56:57
I've grasped that. I'm not saying it's a horrible idea or that it would never work. Its just that you say that it's likely, but you don't have anything to show that it's likely other than your own ideas. Especially when you consider that right now the US government is neutral to Bitcoin at best, and negative towards it in many ways. Maybe that will change in the next 30 or 40 years, but unless something really big happens it isn't at all likely.
"The only thing the Chinese have a big stake in is mining bitcoin, and they’re incentivised not to try and cheat..."
When it is the miners who vote on new bitcoin protocols they have more control than just how much they can mine. They are currently incentivized not to cheat, but a USD backed by bitcoin will give the Chinese government a huge incentive to get involved. They can take over all those Bitcoin farms and now the US is in big trouble because their economy is at the mercy of the Chinese government. There is no way the US government would allow another country to have that much control over them.

You're getting super defensive over nothing. The "like you" wasn't an insult. He's literally saying that the website tries to trick and confuse newbies who don't have all the info (newbies like you) into buying into their scam. It has nothing to do with an insult to your intelligence. I'd say somebody taking time out of their day to explain how a website tries to scam newbies is actually a pretty friendly thing to do.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:29:12
I can't help you, but good luck. It would be nice to see a happy ending to a "lost Bitcoin" story.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:53:35
I mean, I don't know the guy personally so I guess it could have been an insult, I just don't think it is because there are a ton of scammers in the crypto world who rely on newbies who don't know exactly how things work. The scammers don't go after people who have been around for a while because those ones know all the scams to look out for.
So if you do get into buying some bitcoin, be careful. Basically any sort of bitcoin investing is going to be a scam. They will tell you about great profits whether it has to do with mining or trading, but it's all bs. Only legit thing is to buy and sell on a legit exchange doing the work yourself.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:44:28
Dude why are you still talking to me? I know you're running a scam. You're never going to get any money out of me. I'm clearly just wasting your time so you have less time to try to scam other people.

I'm going to give you some advice here. Please don't take it as an insult, I'm not trying to insult you I just want to help you out.
Stay away from Bitcoin. To be frank, if you couldn't tell that this was a scam right away then I fully believe you will probably be scammed at some point in the future. This was a very obvious scam, so if you couldn't spot it now, well there are much better scams you will come across in the future and I doubt you will be able to resist them. 
The stage that Bitcoin is at right now is not for everyone. There are A LOT of people getting scammed out of a lot of money. So this is not a personal attack on you. A lot of other people are falling for scams too. I'm just trying to help you out because I don't like it when people get scammed. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:24:08

I'm jealous of your $9k average, lol. I didn't start buying until June, so I'd have to put a lot in to get my average under even $10k.  If Christmas wasn't coming up I'd be able to put more in, but I don't think the family would enjoy stockings full of Bitcoin and nothing else on Christmas morning.
@_date: 2019-12-23 14:09:03
When you set up a wallet it will give you 12 or 24 words (depending on the wallet). You absolutely MUST write these down. On paper. Do not enter them into your computer or take a picture of them. If your device that has your wallet gets lost or destroyed, you can use these words to retrieve your wallet on another device. You must keep them safe though, if somebody else gets your words, they get your wallet. Treat them like cash.
I'd suggest not using anything that makes you sign up with an account just to use their wallet. You shouldn't be giving anybody your information for that. However, if you want to buy Bitcoin off an exchange you will need to make an account for that. Most people suggest not keeping Bitcoin on an exchange, because if I gets hacked you can lose your coins. Move them to a wallet you control. If you are dealing with more than a few hundred USD worth of coins, look into getting a hardware wallet. They cost money though, so it's not worth it for just a hundred bucks worth of coins.
I've never used PayPal, so I don't know about that one, but watch out for scams with PayPal. Since they control your money, if they decide you did something they don't like they can lock your account and you can't do shit about it.

To be honest, I almost bought in 2012 and for that reason. I never did though, it seemed tobe a really complicated way to just buy some drugs. I'm buying now though, and I'm hodling.

Maybe he means the current average transaction fee? I don't know if that would be correct or not though. Seems a bit high since so many people do min fees.
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:35:03
I think (well, I hope) that he didn't mean billions of BTC, but billions of dollars worth of BTC. The 21 million coins thing is such a basic part of Bitcoin that it would be super weird if this guy didn't know it. But then again, some people purposely buy bcash instead of Bitcoin, so you never know.
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:37:33
Most wallets you can set your own fee.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:24:47
I don't know what you mean by chargeback on hardware wallets. Do you mean if somebody sends you Bitcoin to your hardware wallet, can they get it back with a chargeback? No, there is no way to do that.
Bitcoin isn't like a bank, once it is sent it is GONE. It is impossible to get it back. I don't know what you mean by chargeback on exchanges either. They can/might refund money or crypto if there was a mistake, but even an exchange can't do anything about returning crypto once it is sent.
Also, a very common scam is "investing" in bitcoin mining or trading. They will promise great returns but it is always a scam. The only way you'll make money from bitcoin is buying low and selling high. Never send bitcoin to anybody who says they can use it to get more, it's a scam.

If you need it done quick, this is the way to go. But it won't be cheap. Bitcoin ATMs can have fees above 10%.

I've never heard of this, but it just doesn't seem legit. Saying they handle the legal? What legal aspects are there to giving somebody Bitcoin? You hand it over and it's theirs. Idk, just seems like they are purposely making it sound more complicated than it is to try to reel in people who don't know about Bitcoin. I'd stay away.

I have zero reason to not trust the exchange I use, but I still took my coins out yesterday.  I feel it's important for exchanges to know that their customers won't let them get away with screwing around. If they know proof of keys is coming every year, they will be less likely to make stupid decisions. And it's important for scam exchanges to get found out, and if most users withdraw once a year those exchanges won't be able to last long and will be able to scam less people.
@_date: 2019-12-11 03:29:21
And there are people who don't think reading instructions are very important, and don't record the seed at all. I believe there was a "lost Bitcoin" post a while back that involved that. The guy said he didn't think that step was that important so he didn't bother, lol.

Its not about coinbase BTC not being real. Its about Coinbase not having as much BTC as their customers have deposited. So basically if you add up all the BTC in all the Coinbase accounts, it comes to X amount, but if you add up all the BTC that Coinbase actually controls in their wallets, it comes to Y amount, which is much less than X.
Don't know how true this is, but that is what they are saying.

"The cheap way is to sign up for two exchanges, one to take bank deposits, and one to trade at good rates. This is a huge hassle, and will take a month, when all is said and done, because most exchanges that take RL money will hold it for a period of time, and will need your identity documents."
Some places it takes a month? That's crazy. (Not crazy as in I don't believe you, crazy as in that's a long ass time to wait) Makes me glad I live in Canada. I sent documents to verify my ID in the morning, and when I was heading to work at 10pm that night I was able to buy BTC and withdraw immediately. It frustrates me to read about how other people have to wait so long just to buy Bitcoin.

Nobody knows what is going to happen. A good example is your coworker acting like he knows, but he was wrong. If you think it will go up, buy back in. 
Personally, I would buy back in at a loss. And then if it keeps going up, great. But if it drops again, well still great, because now I can buy in for more at a better price.
But I'm holding long term. So I am stacking sats every time it dips.

That's great! I don't think any of my family would be interested in crypto, so I'm not going to bother. Most likely they would either sell it right away and I'd just be out the fees, or they would forget about it and it would be another addition to the great pile of Lost Coins.

When I was first setting up my Trezor, I read the first couple words out loud as I wrote them down. Then I stopped and realized I probably shouldn't do that. Phones are listening even when you don't think they are. It may be paranoid as fuck, but I'd rather be paranoid and safe than to take a risk even if that risk is a million to one.
My gf and I have had too many experiences of us talking about something and then one of us starts getting ads related to that thing on our phone. Never looked it up online or anything, just talked with the phone sitting beside me, then bam, ads. So they are listening.

Ok, I see what you're saying, but none of that makes it LIKELY that it's going to happen. It could all work, but I seriously doubt that the US government is going to back their own currency with a digital currency that they don't completely control. Especially with the amount of mining that is done in China.
If the US government went ahead and did that they would be at a great risk of China being able to manipulate their currency. I just can't believe that the US government would allow a foreign power to have that much control over their dollar.

People talk about their personal lives on here. A scammer could go through your post history, learn about you, and use that to come up with a way to find out who you are. I'm not an expert, I'm just repeating what people who seem to know more than me are saying. Imo, it's best to be safe.
Of course, if you have a username that is only used for Bitcoin talk that is a way to be safer too.
Best way to be safe is to own a max of 0.001 BTC, like me. If it moons, I'll finally be able to buy that 2001 Ford Focus I've had my eye on.

Also if China tried to tank the world economy by tanking Bitcoin, not only would they hurt themselves, but it would give the rest of the world the chance to snatch up all that cheap Bitcoin, both to recover the economy and so that they would own a greater share of Bitcoin when it recovers. So it would hurt them all in the short term, but if bitcoin was able to recover then China would be the only loser long term.
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:37:19
That's why I love the price dips. I first got in at the start of June, so I bought some when it was pretty expensive. Now I buy more every dip to get that average cost down. If it moons I'm gonna be happy whether my average is 10k or 7k, so no point in whining about it.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:27:00

It's tough to understand what you are saying. I see that English isn't your first language. From what I can gather, and from the response from the Jaxx rep, it's very possible that because English isn't your first language you didn't understand how important it was to back up your wallet by keeping the seed phrase. I'm sure they said to because that's what wallets do. So it sucks that you lost your money but it's not really their fault. They didn't take it.

I'm not saying you're wrong, just kinda blows my mind that it is THAT hard to crack it. I know it's impossible to know the future of computers, but I was assuming by that time they would be able to get it down to a manageable level. Thanks for your reply.

I think you are confusing a couple things. There are wallets and exchanges. A wallet stores/holds your coins, while an exchange lets you buy/sell coins. There are wallets that are not associated with any exchanges, and there are wallets that are. An exchange will have their own wallet, so that you can keep track of how many coins and fiat you have stored with them.
I don't think there is any wallet that is not connected to an exchange where you can buy and sell crypto, but I could be wrong. So you won't be able to buy from a KYC exchange, and move to a non custodial wallet and sell your coins on it.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:59:24

I don't know his situation, but some people are just really bad with money, and know they are. In that case it would make sense to let somebody who is responsible handle everything. So I'm just going to pretend that is what is happening here.

Let's see. First you lied about how you got downvoted when the other person asked about it.
Then you lied about me posting on a forum for women. It's called askwomen. People go there to ASK women questions, ya Dingus.
Then you lied about my question being removed for being creepy. It was removed because it was a yes/no question, which apparently they don't want.
So, three strikes makes a liar of you. Maybe try not to lie so much in the future. Liar.

And honestly, his 99.9% figure was very optimistic. You're being scammed. If I could somehow find a betting website that would lay odds on this, I would go there right now and bet my entire wallet that you're being scammed.
Think about it. Why would some guy approach some random person THEY DONT EVEN KNOW and send them thousands of dollars? They wouldn't. That's like walking up to some random person and handing them cash, and saying hey just be a pal and hold on to this while I turn my back and count to a thousand. Nobody would do that because people would run off with the money.

I have no idea. I don't know what that card is, I just know that when money is involved some people will do what they can to steal it. You said the card has their name on it? Maybe do a search on Facebook, might be able to find them that way.

That sucks you got scammed. Thank you for posting your story though. It's possible by posting it that you will keep somebody who is new to crypto from suffering the same fate. The more people who post about scams, the better for the community. If more people are able to see and learn about them, then scammers will be less successful.
I don't know why some people give others a hard time on here when they admit to being scammed. It only slows down mass adoption when somebody looks into crypto and sees people getting laughed at or insulted after being scammed.
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:53:55
You done messed up, now I got your promo code! They even say in the message not to share it. LoL That BTC is all mine. Now I just have to send them 0.1 BTC to release the funds and I'm laughing all the way to the bank!
@_date: 2019-09-14 08:57:15
In the article it says it's not physical cash, but cash transfers to a bank account. So basically a scammer/hacker steals a bunch of money, and then instead of risking themselves, they sell it at 10-12% of its value for bitcoin. They then transfer the stolen money to the purchaser, who now has the risk of being caught. But the study never actually tested any of this, they just found it for sale in dark web markets. So it's very possible or probable that it's just a scam, and when you send the BTC you'll just get a "lol n00b" sent back to you.
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:27:22

Yes, but he's just 14, so I'm assuming he's not going to be depositing $100+. So if he only buys $20, and doesn't set the fee low, he could use up a lot of it just practicing.

You can use a Bitcoin ATM.  You will pay higher fees, but it won't be connected to your name. Just make sure you research it first so you know the ATM is a legit one and you don't make any mistakes that could cause you to lose your coins.

@_date: 2019-09-02 11:54:21
I'm assuming that in the future, when computers are advanced to the point where it won't take billions and billions of years to brute force a private key, that bitcoin wallets and addresses will also be changed so that they can stay a few steps ahead of this.
So assuming this happens, at this point would it also become feasible to "mine" Bitcoin in this way out of all the current and future wallets that own bitcoin but have had their keys lost? This way, depending on how far in the future it happens, some people will mine bitcoin the standard way, as the rewards slowly drop to zero, but you will also have people putting their efforts towards recovering lost Bitcoin.
Could this have a huge effect on bitcoin? Because by that point, the mining rewards will be pretty small, but you'll also have certain people cracking open addresses that contain hundreds or thousands of BTC. 
I'm sure somebody has thought of this before, I just haven't seen it.

Some people see those $$$ and lose all ability to think rationally.

@_date: 2019-09-03 12:36:51
People like those nice round numbers, but they also known that OTHER people like those numbers. So you won't just see a huge sell off at 50k, because some people will want to beat the crash and sell at 49k, while others will want to beat THEM and sell at 48k. And those coins getting sold will be bought up by people who are hodling to 70k, or 100k.
So while I think it will probably crash at some point after next ATH, I don't think it will be as easy to spot as just every upcoming round number will have one.
Ps. I'm the furthest thing from an expert, and generally have no clue what the fuck I'm talking about. I have nothing to back up my statements, it's more just how I feel about the nature of people.

I don't know what the correct term is, but the rules of bitcoin would be changed where a Satoshi would no longer be the smallest amount. It's possible some miners would not agree to this change and then it would cause a fork, but I doubt that many would not want to change it because not changing would make people use it less.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:48:07
Embarrassment is a killer in Bitcoin. There are no stats but I'm sure the number is quite high of the amount of people who got scammed because they didn't want to ask an "embarassing" question. People don't want to seem stupid to a bunch of strangers, so they don't ask, and lose their coins.
I know it's too late for you as it already happened, but you could save others from the same fate by telling it. Yeah, it's probably stupid, but I guarantee you that there are people who have done way worse.

Never respond to DMs about crypto. They are ALWAYS a scam. Nobody is helping you set up a wallet out of the kindness of their hearts. If you have more questions, ask on here or on r/Bitcoinbeginners, where other people can see the responses so you know it's not a scam.
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:30:50
Would you be comfortable doing that with any amount of bitcoin though?
I agree with you to a certain point, but if I struck it rich and suddenly had an extra half million to buy coins with, I wouldn't feel comfortable having it all on a single wallet. Maybe spread it out over a few different hardware wallets. Like buy a Trezor, Ledger, and Coldcard, so if one fails I don't lose everything.
I know that if you do everything right it should be safe, but I think for personal peace of mind I would spread it around a bit, once you are talking about that amount of money.
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:22:13

Anybody can absolutely track the movement of Bitcoin. It's all public for everybody to see. The hard part is knowing which Bitcoin belongs to which people. Now if you buy your Bitcoin from an exchange after doing KYC, your coin movements can be tracked and connected to you.
I don't know a lot about different wallets, but I think most have apps.  And different wallets can use different coins. I assume you mean altcoins when you said trade between several coins. So depending on what coins you want to buy, you'll have to look into which wallets support them.

There are thousands of alt coins. And 99.9% are a scam. They weren't created to to solve problems, they were created to make money for the person/people who started it. There are a few (less than 10), that seem to have legitimate use cases and aren't just gambling. Also, there have been many cases of people making a new coin, pumping it up, and then dumping their own holdings while leaving everyone else holding the bags. That can't happen with bitcoin because it's not controlled by just a few people.

" Essentially the only way in owning bitcoin is through the website which someone else linked. "
Incorrect. There are many ways to acquire Bitcoin, that was just one way. You can buy off one of many exchanges. You can buy it from bitcoin ATMs. You can meet somebody in person and buy it for cash. 
But you need a wallet to hold it. When you buy it from an exchange, you can hold it in a wallet on that exchange, but most don't like to do that because it can get hacked. Get a personal wallet and then you control your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:41:54
Basically it works like this. If you do KYC you will be able to buy Bitcoin easier, cheaper, and more securely (as long as you're doing it right). Buying without KYC will usually be more difficult, more expensive, and more likely to get scammed. Without KYC you can use BTMs, but those always have high fees. You can buy from other people, but you might get scammed. And I don't think there are many (if any at all) places you can buy with a debit card without KYC. From what I've seen, non-KYC purchasing can be a bit more complicated for a newcomer.
So basically it comes down to how much you value your privacy. Just sending out your ID doesn't automatically mean you'll get scammed, there are legit places that do it. Just research them first. Don't just use any old exchange that pops up on a Google search. There are lots of posts on r/Bitcoinbeginners about how to buy.
And just a tip, if you're asking for help about buying, let them know your country, because not all exchanges are available in all countries. So it can help people give your advice for where to buy.
