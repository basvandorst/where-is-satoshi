That’s why you only make 49 trades a year and then just do that every year, to get over on THE MAN.

I like mine. I’m a little bummed that my Nan S can only install 3 of the apps I needed before it was out of space.  Need to buy another if I want more coin storage, seems a little short sighted.

Only losing because you are choosing to sell low. This has nothing to do with bitcoin or cryptocurrency. You can do the same things with stocks or commodities, lose money because you buy high and sell low.

Redditor for 3 months?  Maybe you are too young to remember when banks started using websites for account access. Wasn’t exactly like you describe but not far off. And banking was a mature business model, unlike crypto. 
Don’t let the door hit you on the way out, I’m sure everything will fall apart without your support.
