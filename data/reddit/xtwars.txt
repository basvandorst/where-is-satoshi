Governments will always attempt to ban encryption or privacy-related technologies because it restricts their power over sensitive information of their citizens.
Bitcoin will eliminate or at least take away the majority of this power of the government. Until then, don't be surprised to see governments pulling off these kind of unethical and immoral proposals.

You can put anything in front of "Could Deliver Gains of Up to 1,450% by 2025" and be mostly correct. That doesn't mean anything.

I remember when Putin appeared on national television to talk about bitcoin and its regulatory policies in Russia. He knew absolutely nothing about bitcoin and why it is valuable. Neither does this government kiss ass. Eventually, they will realize that bitcoin will not be regulated.

One interesting characteristic of bitcoin is that its price or value is primarily affected by the demands of its users unlike fiat money. People seem to struggle in understanding the merits of a decentralized currency. It is not affected by political events or government actions. This is what makes bitcoin so great and the world's first genuine international currency.

These congressmen / members that have absolutely no knowledge of technology and economics dumbfounded by their fellow government scammers try to shut down any form of technology that could potentially replace existing government operations or systems. If anything, this is positive for bitcoin because the congress believes that they can't compete with bitcoin and fears it. They're scared they'll lose the only source of power they have which is their control over monetary systems.

I think it directly relates to what John McAfee stated in a recent interview: "We are in the world of digital transactions and the digital glue that holds everything together, do you think paper money and the gold standard have any meaning whatsoever in that world? It does not"

Like every other technology, i believe smart contract systems need trial and error to perfect it (if it can ever be). I think Charlie makes an excellent point. In a digital world, paper contract could be replaced with smart contract-based systems.

It is incredibly easy in Asia to do all 4 of them with bitcoin. Startups like Coins.ph and Coinplug enable users to settle utility bills, pay for food, settle rent and others using bitcoin. Also sending remittances is possible through convenience stores, bank ATMs, etc.

I'm the author of the article and I believe it was not terrible reporting. That is one comment from one supposed creditor.
The WSJ reported that all proceedings will be settled in the value equivalent to yen in 2014. 
"We submitted our claims for what we had on our accounts at the time that Mtgox closed in whatever currency we had." -&gt; if this is true, then there should be no controversy beause they can simply file a lawsuit.

We need more of this. More merchant adoption in general so that bitcoin users can utilize the currency with ease.

I can confirm I want fully electric airplanes and eliminate fuel-based aircraft from the global airline market. The question is how. If its going to be a centralized system that will replace yet another centralized system, there is no use for it. IMF can hope to remove all cash. Bitcoin will achieve that hope.

Author of the article here.
First off, i apologize to both Greg and Warren for the inconvenience i have caused.
Second, what i meant to actually suggest in the article was, even if Warren still works for Theymos (he obviously doesn't)
1. He has absolute freedom to work for Theymos outside of the Blockstream work that he does. 
2. If Theymos paid Warren, that wouldn't mean a connection between blockstream and Theymos exists, as it is Theymos paying a blockstream employee, not the other way.
3. Even in the situation in which Theymos pays Warren while his stay at blockstream, the entire argument that blockstream is connected to Theymos is not only illogical but insensible.

Its not that simple. Why would Charlie Shrem decide whether Segwit is getting activated or not. If it was, Segwit would have been running months ago.

A market that has less than 6 percent of global bitcoin exchange market share could push bitcoin price beyond record levels??
Top five markets are Japan, US, South Korea, China and USDT. EU is not even in the top 5. 
More than anything, bitcoin price is currently being driven by the Japanese bitcoin market's explsive growth.

It was $900,000 and they compensated that.
More to that, they compensated extra $3 million to users as an apology, $90 per account that was affected.
Also, they opened a new customer support center (shown above) to make sure they can handle all requests 24/7 and prevent any delays.
Remember, they have more than 1 million active users and they're striving to provide live customer service to all users.

All jokes aside, the institutions, government agencies, and establishments that have supposedly been testing or "pilot testing" the blockchain technology on their 1980s IT systems have nothing to show.
Take R3 for instance, they have all the resources in the world they need. Multi billion dollar banks, companies, and developers helping them. After a year, they don't have a fucking thing to show.
More importantly, people should recognize that bitcoin has been the only working product of the blockchain technology upto date. Sure the Ethereum network has been a little of bit of success. But, is the network's 1 billion dollar marketcap justified? does it have any commercial value? or real world value?
The decline of blockchain hype should have occured months if not years ago. If all these resources spent on building bullshit "permissioned blockchain" technologies were used for bitcoin startups and infrastructure, we'd have a far better bitcoin ecosystem right now.
