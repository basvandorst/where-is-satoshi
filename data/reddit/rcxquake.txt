As someone who went through the exact same problem, let me give you the answer nobody else has chanced upon:
The version of armory you downloaded is for an online version of ubuntu.  It assumes you have access to dependencies.
There is a version of armory that includes all dependencies that was specifically compiled for an offline computer.  Go back to the [armory download page]( but instead go to the "linux" section.  You want the "offline" bundle. Read the text if you are confused - it talks about the offline version.
Also: good job on being proactive about understanding the security and taking steps to be secure.  It's confusing at first, but well worth it.

No, just more than the honest fork.


Nope, he just needs to get ahead of it once, and the honest fork will seed to the 51% attack.

You are making the assumption that one block = one vote.  That's not how it would work.
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:50:23
I see what you are saying about each point and how it affects *you* directly, but you aren't taking into account the motivation for these attacks.
I don't see very much motivation for an attacker to execute number 5.  What groups of people could an attacker have motivation to block that would constitute a sufficiently large coin-age percentage of transactions?  Perhaps a country - what others?
The motivation (and thus, the likelihood of a 50% attack actually happening) is far larger for the first four.  Remember that a very large reason that bitcoin is even taking off is because of the difficulty to execute attacks 3 and 4.  In bitcoin's infancy, wikileaks had its donations from visa, mastercard, and paypal all blocked.  Bitcoin started to reach the public eye because wikileaks transitioned to it for donations.  It appealed to many people because *no* central authority could arbitrarily decide who could and could not make or receive payments.  Take this away, and what does bitcoin really offer over its competition?
The answer is less than nothing.  
~~"But the transaction fees!" you cry.  But wait - the attacker can raise the transaction fees to higher-than-paypal levels, and you would be forced to pay them.~~  Not only that, but they could (and will, given the reward involved) execute double-spend attacks whenever they wanted.  
Until these problems are solved, scenario  can be ignored, as (I hope) I have shown that it is small potatoes compared to the other implications of a 50% attack.
EDIT: actually, transaction fees won't rise significantly.  The attacker needs to include transactions in order to maintain control of the blockchain.  The other points are still valid, though.

IIRC even the net votes aren't real once it's larger than a certain number.  Reddit figured out that users like to see a net vote as well as up and down votes, so include it in there even though the numbers are made up.  Obviously your votes are still kept track of, and used to make up the fudged numbers.
@_date: 2014-01-12 10:58:07
The problem with this "solution" is that it doesn't really fix anything.  What does a 51% attack allow you to do?
1. Obtain 100% of mining rewards
2. Execute a double spend attack
3. Stop specific people from sending bitcoins
4. Stop specific people from receiving bitcoins
5. Stop a large percentage of transactions from receiving confirmations
Now, which of these are solved by the linked solution?  The *only* time this solution would help is in case number 5, where an attacker is attempting to prevent a large percentage of transactions - and I see very few usage scenarios of this as compared to the far more juicy fruit listed above.

Not quite.  &gt;50% is significant and it is absolutely different than a 10% attack.
When you mine a block, you can choose which block to mine it from.  So a person executing a 51% attack could simply choose to ignore any block mined by the other 49%.  In this way, they *will* mine every single block in a row simply by ignoring every block anyone else mines.  Since they have more hashing power, they can do this indefinitely and nobody else will be able to make a longer chain in the long run.

Of the 62 possibilities each character could be, 26 of them are upper/lowercase.  The chance of finding all upper/lowercase would be (26/62)^33, which is actually higher than the palindrome (1/62)^7.
I'm actually most impressed by what they list as   There are less than 20,000 12-character words, so the chance of getting one is (2/62)^12 * 20,000.  That's over 10 times less likely than the 1234**4321 palindrome.

That would be possible if it were one miner that decided what to include in the blocks and could recoup all of its own transaction fees.  However, there are many competing miners, so what would end up happening in practice is that any miner that attempted to do this would simply be giving away its bitcoin to the other miners.

Do miners primarily get blocks through non-mining nodes?
Seems like miners should prioritize giving blocks to other miners first (it is in their best interest to ensure the network is mining off of their block and not a fork).
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:41:38
While full nodes do validate blocks, they do not help keep validation of transactions decentralized - that is the role of the miners.  Hosting a full node reduces strain on the network by helping to relay blocks to other nodes.
Unfortunately there is little to no benefit to the host of the node.  The only one I can think of is that you have indepedently verified the blockchain and thus aren't open to a MitM attack from a third party you are trusting to update balances (phone apps, web apps are open to these attacks).

I don't think saying it reduces the performance of a network is accurate.  Rather, one full-speed node is better than two half-speed nodes.

@_date: 2017-10-02 17:34:44
Right...and I just realized, Moore's law can also be considered a "steady state".  If we are continuously increasing efficiency, we can say that we will also continuously increase hashing power.  This equates to a 1.3% increase in hashing power every two weeks, so about 1.3% extra blocks mined (continuously, in steady state) due to Moore's law.  This equates to less than 1.3% extra bitcoins due to the halving, however.

I just took the example to one block further.  In reality, you can keep moving it on, just the calculations get more complex.  The selfish miners can get two, three blocks ahead and nullify ever increasing amounts of honest miners blocks.  And when the honest miners do finally get a block, the selfish miners hop on and start the cycles anew.

They only have 45% of the hashing power, so of course they will more than likely lose the first block.  If that happens, they just accept it and move to the next.  They really benefit when they are the first to generate the block, as the chance they will generate subsequent blocks goes up (as the next block generated by the honest miners are effectively wasted).

To expand: Let's look at an example where the selfish miners control 45% of the hash power and see how much money they make.
Block 1: 45% chance selfish, 55% honest
If Selfish win first, they release it when honest generates one.  At this point, there is a fork in the chain.  Now, 45% selfish AND 27.5% honest are mining on the selfish chain, and 27.5% are on the honest chain.  In addition to this, the selfish group have had additional mining time equal to the difference between when the selfish group generated a block and when the honest group generated a block.  
Thus, there is a &gt;72.5% (guess off the top of my head: actual ~85%) chance that the selfish block chain will be the dominant fork, nullifying the honest block generated.  This is key to their strategy: nullifying the honest group's time spent generating blocks.

From what I understand, they are actually correct.  You attempt to disprove  the paper by picking an arbitrary number and showing that the conclusion it draws is false.  Of course, if you were right here, you would have proved their conclusion was false.
Unfortunately, your example that if (a) = 50% the attacker takes all the money is actually TRUE.  It's called the 50% attack (some people prefer the term 51%).  When the attacked controls over half the hashing power (remember, in reality this is 50.000000...1%, or practically just 50%), they can refuse to "recognize" an honest miner's block and put in their own.  Since they have over half the hashing power, their block will grow at a faster rate and be the new standard.
TL;DR: OP made a false assumption, everything is wrong.

The client receiving the block still validates it.  If it is invalid, it is rejected outright, even if the blockchain is longer than the current valid blockchain.  
Current bitcoin protocol (afaik) requires validating every single block in the chain from the origin.  I have 15gb of blockchain info on my hard drive.  I believe there was talk about making trusted blocks to act as an "origin" every so often, but I don't think it was ever implemented.

Actually it does work like "that" (I put "that" in quotes, because you don't state what you are referring to).
If you read the paper, you would have browsed past [this]( graph.  I do not claim that with 45% hash rate they will completely bar honest miners from making money, simply that they will make a disproportionate amount.  


Unfortunately, this isn't true.  A selfish group will "store" their generated blocks and only release them enough to stay ahead of the honest pool.  If the selfish group has over 51% of hashing power, *any* block generated (even a string of them) will simply be ignored by the selfish group, and in the long run the selfish group will produce the longer blockchain devoid of a single honest block.
