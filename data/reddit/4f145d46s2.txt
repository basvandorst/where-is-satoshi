Do *you* understand why it was going up, though?

Public keys are generated from private keys. Addresses are generated from public keys. A public key can only correspond to one private key, but many public keys (and thus private keys) can map to the same address.
So any of these two can actually happen:
* Two people get the same private key, public key and address. Both people can access the wallet and sign transactions.
* Two people get different private and public keys, but the public keys both map to the same address (this is possible because to go from public key to address you use a hash). Both people can again access the wallet and sign transactions, even if they use different keys (i.e. you can actually tell *who* authorized the transaction, but it's still the same wallet).

Yes, you are printing keys that **your customers send you**. By "you" in my previous comment I wasn't referring to you, but to your customers really.
So the key is already *in the wild*, no sense in covering it afterwards.

Ah, so BIP 38 keys. I still don't understand the usecase. The only rationale behind BIP 38 keys is that exposing the key is safe as long as the passphrase is secure. This means that the "scratch off" stuff is rather useless.
Besides, to me, these sort of "BTC card wallets" seem to be only useful for handing them out (as gifts I guess). If the key still requires a passphrase, that's a piece of information that has to travel through a different means than the card, and that has to be a secure channel. If a secure channel must be used for that, why not use it for the whole private key?
Sorry, not trying to be an asshole, but I just can't see the usecase for these at all.

You still had to send the key in to get it printed. It has been written *somewhere* and transferred over the internet.

So what you're saying is basically "stop trying to use a currency for currency-stuff for 3 days every time someone wants to break it!", right?
Yeah, this sounds super useful.

Arbitrage cannot "fix" market differences because there is no fast and cheap way of moving assets between exchanges. At least not with the current mempool.

You can only do that when solo mining, so only applicable to around 0.000001% of BTC users?

You do realize one (or possibly more) employees of whatever company you got to etch that HAS the private key (or keys if you did many of these), right?
Edit: If you actually did that yourself, what's the point? Is it for yourself only? Anyone you give it to shouldn't trust that wallet for the very same reason I explained above.

Of total supply of what? If I find a rock in the street and claim it for my own does this mean everyone else gets deducted some BTC to allocate for the new value I've just *created*?

Might want to return that sarcasm detector of yours.
