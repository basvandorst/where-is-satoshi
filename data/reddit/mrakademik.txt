Needs more creased khakis.

But what about Ripple?
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:52:43
$206.54 per bitcoin.

I did not add a credit card, but I have a Level 2 verification.  I have purchased from them twice in the past with no issues (linking to the same bank account).  It's clearly a result of them not wanting to lose money.

Is there any service in which I can instantaneously order bitcoin without having to wait 7 days?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:15:43
You're correct, that's what I meant.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:37:54
I've sent them a letter and received an auto-response.  I have a feeling I won't be seeing them honoring the order at the order price (unless, of course, the price of bitcoin tumbles).

I'm with you.  I need to double-verify.  Without double-verifying, I agree that it's totally reasonable to expect that an ACH transfer will take a few days (as it does when transferring fund between banks).  My only issue is with the "high-risk" flag and resulting 10+ days trying to deal with it (and the initial lack of responsiveness from Coinbase.com)
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:59:45
Not if they decided to push the transaction through at the original price.  That's my point.  The uncertainty and lack of expectation that the transaction will occur (and if so, in a timely manner) that is the real annoyance.

Thanks for the info.... its appreciated.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:33:54
How is anyone expected to do any business with these assholes if this is the shit they pull?

I've been through the same thing, and it was finally worked out 14 days later.  I'm glad it worked out, but there are quite a few issues:
1) What if the price of bitcoin tanked during that 14 days and I was unable to unload my coins if I wanted to?  Also, the money was not in my bank account either, but 'in limbo.'  As a result, I had neither my cash nor did I have the bitcoin.
2) Coinbase responded to some of my emails, and others were ignored.  I had to email them numerous times with increasing frequency in order to get the issue resolved.
3) I included the transaction information/tracking in my emails, but it seemed to be ignored as they were referencing a different transaction than the one I was inquiring about.
With that being said, I echo OP's sentiments.  "I was pissed for days, but it's all good now. Coinbase honored my original orders. We cool now. Thanks Coinbase."

The only problem, is that by tomorrow those bitcoins will be worth half as much as they are today, or twice as much.  The volatility of this currency is going to be what kills it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:40:21
Haha, thanks man.  Although I have no idea how to redeem that tip.

Just used bitquick for the first time.  Found this old post so i figured I would pile on the compliments (especially after just being burned by Coinbase).  The service was very straightforward and I receive my bitcoin almost instantly.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:24:01
Agreed.  I understand that they are busy now, but when dealing in ForEx, timing is crucial, especially with such a volatile market.  With that being said, I DO appreciate them honoring the original purchase price.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:00:41
I understand that, but I would like that to be my decision, and not have bitcoin force me into that position.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:20:00
That's the real question... from what I can tell, it seems incredibly arbitrary.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:09:10
Or, Option C.  I order bitcoins and Coinbase.com sends them quickly at the price I intended to buy them at.  I'm not trying to have my cake and eat it too.

Looking at your user history, and it checks out.  You're a cunt.
