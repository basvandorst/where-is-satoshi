Mining is worthless rn. You're talking pennies a day, while the electricity to power that will cost you tens of dollars a month. Don't do it rn unless you have free electricity and an insane mining computer. Seriously 
You get a few satoshi every now and then. Use faucets. Same amount of btc and not any electricity used (negligible)

Sorry but he didn't have that kind of power. It was a correction. A market soars 400% and when it corrects to still 250% gains you blame it on an inside job? Come on man, this is basic market watch here.

That's why I asked this aiming towards people who ARENT in it to flip it. I'm asking about its future as a currency and if it's actually viable. Just made me think due to the recent news press about government already trying to regulate it and get a cut (go figure). Not doubting it, just asking everyone how they think it'll pan out in the years to come.

Everyone, he just admitted to being a shill through DM's. that's his referral link. Don't sign up. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:13:42
That's great news to hear. You sure about that though? Do you happen to have a source 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:37:34
Dude you spread so much FUD and bs. You're "involved" in like 10 coins and sell out immediately. This isn't a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:17:08
How is it bullshit that you spreading a fake coin got deleted from bitcoin only discussion? Dumbass. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:44:04
You're completely right. It's the base. Bitcoin needs to pick up its slack. I know everyone here is a circle jerk (not exactly a bad thing always. Morale is good), but we gotta focus on getting things like lightning networks in play. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:08:28
Despite what people say, if you're really living paycheck to paycheck, and you have bitcoin, don't feel awful about cashing out and paying off debt, or funding school. I know that's not the purpose of bitcoin, but nobody could blame you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:55:14
So how much money would they start off being worth? Like let's say I had 1 bitcoin. Would I just have 1 bitcoin diamond? And could bitcoin diamond be worth $25 while bitcoin platinum is worth $100?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:39
I'd say this could be true long term. It'll bounce back tomorrow due to people wanting back in, but unless they fix fees it probably will have some issues coming soon 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:23
$23,000 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:19
Litecoin is the most promising right now. Even at bitcoins price it would have 1/4th the fees. Bitcoin just needs to use its massive support and donations and get a lightning network asap.

No you just don't understand crypto and you're account is 2 weeks. You just got in and take any media as fact. Tell me, how did roger purposely crash the market? What's your evidence?
I see it as-
Everyone heard people were becoming millionaires off an online coin. Easy enough right? They all buy into it. Boom, it skyrockets. Everyone is making money. Now that we've all made money and we're seeing stable price, that must be the peak. Let's sell off. 
Then everyone sells off (tonight) and the prices plummet. Bitcoin cash plummeted too. Why would Roger sabotage his own crypto. I hate roger with a passion, but this just isn't what happened.

This was golden. The black lady accurately represents every elderly parent/person not tech involved. The white friend is every person who hears "free profit!" And jumps on board.

It's a 2.57 now 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:30:50
Meaning 5 different types of bitcoin? So if I bought bitcoin gold would I not have any in bitcoin diamond? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:15:43
Why does everyone spell it "loose" on here. Jesus

Fake. Don't use this. OP is a scammer. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:14:03
Don't need it to work again lol. This is pretty accurate. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:23:02
Sorry. Out of the loop, but what are the futures?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:56
You're a dumbass 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:27:23
Sorry, not trying to be a jerk, but these type posts are FUD and people believe what they read. Word spreads fast and next thing you know there could be a CNBC report about how roger crashed the market and to get out quick. Just be careful what you post. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:49:02
I know! Satoshi and whatnot. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:29:27
"Free bitcoin" on iPhones is nice. On the App Store. 
Also it promised that much? How? If you don't earn that much it gives it to you?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:17:54
Hm. Definitely possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:35:49
Damn so you got money to spare. It's pretty cool of you to just offer some money like that to me honestly 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:13:52
"Rich" whatever man lol. You don't pump and dump anything. Nobody takes your Reddit posts seriously to buy coins. You're gonna lose money long run. Stop trying to ruin other people's investments 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:43:22
If I bought BTC in November, are there any forks that I would have? If so how do I access them
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:16:38
You've been here less than a day and are complaining about every second post? You've only had time to even read a few. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:43:09
Lol you *really* shouldn't have invested in crypto. You expect it to always be up? It's at $8000, that's about $7500 more than it was worth a few years back. Sorry if you bought in at 18k and expected it to hit 100k, but the entire stock market is currently crashing, not just crypto. do you wanna tell Wall Street investors to hold onto their emotion support stocks as well? Markets, including crypto aren't always in the green. Get used to it or don't stick around. Pretty simple. 
Also based on your post history it seems you sold. If you sold then why're you even here? I'd guess because you took some losses and now, feeling angsty, want to convince people that *you* were the smart one for getting out now, so that they sell too. See it all the time here, each and every dip.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:51
I'm interested in learning about this. Where can I go to do so?
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:14:20
Okay, that's an entirely different way of putting it. If you believe in blockchain, don't convince people to sell. We all knew a bubble burst was coming, just as it does *every* January. The stock market has absolutely plummeted and people are selling coins to cover their stock market losses. Once the stock market rises again and people are comfortable, then the price will increase again. Don't make people scared of it going to $0 though if you plan on buying back in.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:47:09
Obviously that's not the case considering the crash with bitcoin. It shot up when the stock market did, and crashed when it did. Why would people take their money in an already risky investment, and move it to an even more risky investment. People aren't putting it under a mattress, they're putting it in their savings and waiting for it to bottom out. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:56:43
"Redditors for a day"
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:19:35
It's not your responsibility to warn anyone. It's the validation syndrome. When you buy and are invested, everyone (including me even) posts "hodl to the moon! Nows the cheapest you'll ever get it!" Then the second you sell its "anyone who's still in this is stupid. Sell now before it's too late"
Edit: also charts show that we've basically bottomed out, or are relatively close to it. Has happened every year since 2013 yet people still freak out like it's the first time it's happened. Sure this is a relatively bad crash, but we've seen worse. Tends to rebound by march or may, and then by December it's hyped back up. 
Obviously nobody knows jack shit about the prices and nobody can time it, so don't make yourself responsible for somebody losing or gaining money. Make your own decisions and leave it at that. Also the fact that you plan on buying back in just reassures me this is the case for you (not a bad thing, it's human nature. I admitted to it as well). Bitcoin isn't dead, the stock market is just crashing hard right now and people who are losing money are cashing out on their bitcoin. Here are some reasons for the recent crash:
Chinese New Years- self explanatory. Happens every year. 
Tether: this is currently FUD and will be fixed with time
Stock market: people usually have more money invested in the stock market than crypto, and when you're in the hole there you usually sell the other assets you don't care as much about. They're scraping the barrel for money. This crash could be huge and if it is, we might not see crypto rebound for a while, but it will. 
FUD in general: people freaking out not knowing the reasons for the crash and telling everyone to sell. 
Reasons bitcoin isn't crashing-- it being dead or the technology being obsolete. Give it time man, and in the meantime just keep your eye on it, and leave your advice to yourself, as everyone should.
