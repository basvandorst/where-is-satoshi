You're missing my point. The fact that it was "new way" to do something is what attracted the attention of the crowds. Bitcoin is a "new way" of currency. That doesn't mean it is destined to fail, like the south sea company, but that it has not yet stood the test of time to accurately value it.

Indeed, I am not arguing that bitcoin is worthless, I am arguing that it is currently in a bubble. It may be worth $25k plus some day, but I think we will see 10k or lower before then.  You are correct about the timing point.

Could you explain the fundamentals backing Bitcoin? Based on my research, I think Bitcoin is being driven up by 1. Block chain technology, 2. Security of the currency, 3. No sovereign control of the currency.  Also, euphoria of the crowds has begun to kick in, driving the price higher. 
Am I correct in these assumptions? I would like to understand what (if any) fundamental value bitcoin holds. 
Edit: I would like to add that history rhymes, but it is not identical.

First, I did not make this chart. The reason the author did not include the dot com bubble was because it's % gain was less than the 1929 bubble. The 1929 bubble is included here. 
Not sure how you concluded I have confirmation bias.

South Sea Company bubble was during the 1700's, so I was never employed by them. 
Was a similar experience with a "new way" to do something/make money.

I was researching bitcoin and have knowledge of historical bubbles. This image, mainly the text below the chart, spoke to me as an investor.
