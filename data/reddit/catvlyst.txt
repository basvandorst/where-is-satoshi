I know it sounds terribly ignorant, I didn’t know how exactly bitcoin exchanging worked at the time. I just bought them for certain purchases.

Shame they longer support trading bitcoin

Boy I feel stupid then. For whatever reason I didn’t pay attention to the fact that you could sell on there when I joined. And I preferred using circle initially because the fees weren’t as bad. I’ve learned my lesson.

Unfortunately it has not because I spent all my btcs before the boom. Seeing how things were going though, I stocked up on litecoin a few weeks ago and have been seeing good returns on that. So I have my head out of my ass now.

Really don’t need need the shitty attitude I just asked a question

I have 11 lite coins right now and if they rise by even 100 that’s a good gain for me

You don’t think there is potential for the growth of litecoin? Nabbing LTC for $86 right now rather than dropping 9,000 on a single bit seems to make sense to me for longer term investments when money is an issue.

I just don’t have $9000 on hand right now for one bit

I keep my coins on Coinbase right now because of the ease of reselling. If there were to be a spike in lite coin I could simply press a button and there would be money in the bank. I know I could get an extra wallet but I’ve just kept things simple for now

I don’t really have the money to invest in a meaningful amount of bitcoins right now so I’ve just been stocking up on lite coins with the hope that they become a more common bitcoin alternative in recent years.

I know realistically I wouldn’t have. When I started buying bits in 2016 I was just using it for the occasional dark web purchase like many others. I was not mentally in: “investment mode.” Now that I am a bit older and more conscious of that I’m frustrated with myself for not being aware earlier.
