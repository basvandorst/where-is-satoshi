I'd be happy with just a TL;DR of what happened between the first time Bitcoin went $1000 (November 2013 IIRC? That was the last time I remember being involved with Bitcoin) and now. One of the most intriguing points being, what is SegWit and why are people going crazy over it?
Yes I'm *that* lost but not that much as I've read recently that EU wants to tax Bitcoin and/or make it non-anonymous or something of the sort. I mean, ain't that completely against Bitcoin's own nature? Why do they want to do this? Actually why do they even think they are capable of doing this?

Being a somewhat "new user" that image speaks more than I ever could.

Welp, things are fucked already and I didn't even notice.
Either way, these are pretty detailed recaps, nice work there! Got any advice for someone like me who never actually bought Bitcoin (all I ever had was the result of experimenting faucets, like a few thousand Satoshis)? What should I do regarding all of this?

Bad as in "Fiverr quality"?

Brazilians going batshit for Bitcoin. I actually am.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:04:55
What makes me most depressed is the fact Venezuela is doing it like a pro but Brazil is the same piece of shit every day.
I'm happy for our "hermanos" though, rejoice and carry on.

Whatever, my point still stands. It's really hard for people here to act without the state's intervention, this could be a revolution for us as a big "fuck you" to the government.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:21:08
Well that's the reflection of a country whose government is constrantly trying to eat the shit out of everyone when there's literally nothing else to eat. Nothing new under the sun.

ITT: "Congratulations, I'm the Nth person who's here to remind you that you were such a retarded being back in 2009 that didn't mine Bitcoin when it was still possible with your bare CPU at the time due to fear of setting your PC on fire :D"

If I had BTC I'd give you gold right now, people are totally missing the point.
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:16:18
Fuck's sake, Brazil isn't even on the list.
Well I didn't even knew what I expected tbh. i cri

What, do you want to switch your USD with my BRL? I'd be happy to.

So essentially I just do nothing on August 1st whether we get a hard fork or not?
