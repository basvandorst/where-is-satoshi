Thanks guys! Nice to know it's not just me. Phew!

I sent from coinbase to my ledger and it's still pending. Same?

Heading under 18k :(
Think we'll still hit 20 by new years?

If it's anything like cboe it'll spike up and then settle down. Hard to tell really.

Been waiting to buy rest of my way in, but this dip aint happening! Anybody think Dec 18 will be any different?

I tried to move from Coinbase to my ledger this morning and it's listed on Coinbase as Pending and not showing up in the block chain yet. Assume it's due to Coinebase shitting the bed today, hopefully it should go through in a few hours like others have said.

Explain on your theory?

How does everybody feel the CME futures on Dec 18 will affect the market? I know the longer term benefits it brings like legitimizing and bringing big money in, but how is everybody strategizing their buying? I've been waiting to put in the other half of my initial buy in but been waiting for this "impending drop." Thoughts?

Still not listed on the block chain. Says pending on coinbase but nothing. Eeep!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:33:56
What time should I be watching GDAX to monitor the CME futures launching?

So did I, it's all good though these movements are typical. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:51:24
Care to elaborate? Looking to put the rest of my initial buy in but it keeps being so unpredictable!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:56:30
Waiting to see it test the recent 17k high point again and hold before buying rest of way in. Feel like a larger drop still incoming. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:53
GDAX back up around 17.2k
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:16
gotta wait, goin up too fast. We were under 14 yesterday.

I'm a believer. I want this thing to work, and I also think it's a great (albeit high risk) investment. I've just heard how you can do this to keep yourself afloat when the market dips but I lean more towards what you said. I bet the more I traded the more I'd probably stress and screw up trying to time the market.
