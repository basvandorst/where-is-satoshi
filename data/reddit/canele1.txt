Can’t disagree with much of what you say from a short or medium term perspective - as I said, the crypto ecosystem has a lot of work to do when it comes to actual practical utility use. Just don’t underestimate the work that’s happening out there to increase viability. The technology has amazing potential for good, but as they say Rome wasn’t built in a day.

Facilitating that is part of the many challenges the crypto ecosystem faces in order to increase user adoption in developing economies. But I see no reason why a crypto like Dash, for example, who is keen to gain traction in failing economies like Venezuela couldn’t set up a physical money exchange location in somewhere like Caracas, where someone could exchange their paper USD cash for Dash crypto. Once it’s in crypto you can then trade off into other cryptos, like a stablecoin. But this is only a small piece of the puzzle - increasing user and business adoption is multi faceted and we will not be able to solve all those problems on a reddit conversation. The fundamental concept of a decentralised crypto is broadly similar to the challenges faced during the dotcom boom ... how do you get more people emailing? How do we increase bandwidth? Etc ... all I am saying is there are potentially vast benefits in terms of borderless, fritctionless trading with this technology. It’s easy to keep saying “just use USD cash”, but then what is the point of any country having a domestic currency if you take that approach? It’s messy, expensive, inefficient, and the world is moving to a cashless society.

Epic thread ... makes me want to do some crypto mining for the hell of it

Will do - thanks!

Thanks for sharing. My journey of learning over the last few months has been an enlightening one but a steep learning curve. I’m actually not sure if it can be any other way - you need to have the passion and desire to consume a lot of material across multiple platforms, and enjoy it. I look forward to checking out this resource you shared and evaluating if it’s any good for a newbie or only digestible for people with some crypto transacting and trading experience

Thanks - your post inspired me to do a bit of digging. I mined some Litecoin for the first time ever! I used this beginners guide for joining a mining pool to mine Litecoin using a MacOS cpu! Lol ...  ... I will never get a payout using a cpu but fun to get some experience from a hobby perspective. Any tips on another alt coin I can mine using a Mac CPU with an actual chance of getting some coins / tokens paid out. Don’t care whether I spend a bit more on electricity than mining returns - it’s more about the fun and experience. Thinking of also getting budget mining rig and doing some proper hobby mining ������

Many in the west just don’t get the issues and disadvantages people in troubled states or broken economies face. Crypto is a lifeline for many that simply don’t have access to banks or have rampant inflation domestic currencies. I don’t know much about stable coins like tether and dai, but if I was in a developing country without bank account access, I would be thinking about keeping my money in one of them

You can be sarcastic if you like ... but just imagine being a Venezuelan that kept all their money in the bolivar. Their cash buys them nothing now. Why do you think Dash is making such inroads in that basket case economy?

Sorry if I was a bit snarky in my response to you too. What you say makes sense - I do agree, I would certainly see USD cash as the safest store of value in a developing economy. But I do think crypto can be part of the solution, even on a local level if you can increase both user and business adoption. Having worked for a cryptocurrency, I can tell you that most interest in terms of actual utility use comes from developing countries (by far!) - there is a reason for this. Suspicion comes more from the West, as does large trading activity. Getting access to a cheap smartphone and the internet is far easier than a properly functioning banking system. From my frequent trips to India for example, I can tell you it can be hugely frustrating getting banking and ATM access. You also see the government making a grab for cash in the black economy, severely reducing the wealth of many poor people. In a decentralised crypto ecosystem, this wouldn’t happen. And I can tell you, getting a cheap smartphone and internet access is far easier than getting a bank account and working with the corruption and red tape in a country like India. I don’t doubt that crypto has many challenges to increasing user adoption, security, ease of utility use, etc (to name but a few) ... but the up side is also huge on a global level if these challenges can be solved.

Would love to go back in time, watch those fringe news reports about bitcoin, and experience buying a few bitcoin for peanuts. That would be so fun �� nostalgic article - thanks for posting
