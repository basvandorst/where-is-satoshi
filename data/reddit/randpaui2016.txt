So you can see what was censored, here is the original text of the thread that was removed:
This July 4th, in honor of the Declaration of Independence and the Founding of America, I hereby announce a Bitcoin Bomb for Senator Rand Paul's campaign for the Republican Party nomination.
Polls show that if he wins the Republican nomination he may be the best candidate to defeat the Democrats.  Rand stands for freedom and unregulated Bitcoin.  He is accepting Bitcoin on his donation page and is the only presidential candidate to do so.
Please consider supporting him this July 4th.

All of these claims by the agent and the IRS, and FinCen also are just claims and opinions. And the various government agencies' claims contradict each other, ha! Nobody knows if these claims can be held up in the court of law, as they have never been tested in any courtroom.  The person's lawyer may be right that if its under $1,000 then the license is not needed.  They should argue their position, and its for a court to decide.

Well I do agree with that 100%, we should vote with our feet, and let the market work. Unfortunately it is the government and regulation which causes coinbase to behave this way, interfering with the free market.  But complaining does do some help.  Notice on the e-mail coinbase at least offers to use a secure drop box whatever that is.  I am guessing its a way to encrypt the data for more privacy.  At first they did not offer this, but as the community complained they added the feature, if I recall.

Well I dont know if he will say that, but it does seem like he is coming our way.  Here is a good write up on one of his appearances at a recent bitcoin event: 
It seems his view is mostly positive towards bitcoin.  Although he admits he is not an expert and is still unsure of its value of money, he thinks it could be useful for transfer of assets like stocks, etc...  So I bet he wouldn't rule out that Bitcoin technology would be the future of freedom and mankind.

MoneyBomb was pioneered during Ron Paul's presidential campaign.  Its a day everyone picks to donate in order to make a big splash and get attention.  It tends to generate more donations.  Now we are doing it Bitcoin style, because Senator Paul is the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin.  Nobody is making you donate, that is your choice.  Perhaps you don't want a president that believes in constitutional government and you want another Clinton or Bush in office instead.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:07:17
I have no idea why this was censored.  Its really scary actually.  The government is so out of control crazy, that they may say a MoneyBomb is a threat against the government.  That is how much they attack free speech.  Or reddit is just super scared of anything because they are scared of the government. I heard one time they raided someone over saying "tonight is going to be da'bomb" on twitter when going out with friends to party.  So I would like to specify that by promoting this MoneyBomb, there is no intent to do violence of any kind.
A MoneyBomb is not a real bomb.  It is just a day that everyone picks to donate money on that day.  Its ridiculous that you have to specify this type of thing in a so-called free country.  But with the atmosphere today, I feel it should be done.

This article seems to claim something along those lines:

Well I am seeing pretty good results from Rand Paul already.  Whether he succeeds at becoming president or not, he is having a positive impact.  He is changing the narrative.  He is speaking out about the NSA spying on us and violating the 4th amendment. He even did a 10 hour filibuster to stand up against the Patriot Act.  He is speaking out against violations of the 6th amendment as well, which is the right to trial by jury.  He says that this amendment is violated when the police seize people's money with no crime required.  These are things that Bitcoiners hold dear.  Bitcoin is about liberty, and Senator Paul is promoting liberty.

There is no proof that global warming is real. This last year was some of the coldest temperatures on record.

Not sure if its possible but its an interesting idea.  I think cryptography at least can play an important role in more secure voting.

Could be wrong but it feels like the price and market has taken a bullish turn.  The long consolidation after the last bubble feels like it could be ending.  I think that the recent developments with BIP 100, sidechain elements, and confidential transactions being embraced by the community are helping the price.  It is starting to look like Bitcoin is evolving in a positive direction and this could be attracting more investors.

@_date: 2015-06-08 05:22:20
Your food tastes bad.  The unions are pretty powerful in a lot of places, and they become corrupted and lobby politicians for laws that line their own pockets.  There should be no laws against people forming a union of workers and demanding whatever they want. But there should be no laws against businesses either.  Businesses are now overburdened with regulations.  They must provide minimum wages, and compete with those who scoff the law and hire illegal immigrants instead.  They must provide insurance for their employees and pay huge taxes.
Workers have a right to quit whatever job they have.  Giving money to corporations and banks in banker bailouts is bad not good.  The money is going to the ultra-wealthy who are scamming you for your tax money and putting you out of business with regulations so that they can secure their oligopolies.
@_date: 2015-06-08 05:03:29
It does not work well.  It allows people to buy off influence so they can be the ones that benefit.  It leads to corruption and poverty.  There is even a plan to make everyone poor because people actually fall into the trap of believing your utopian fantasy.  Please look into the [Cloward and Piven Strategy]( devised by Columbia University Professors and activists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven.  They called for overloading the U.S. public welfare system in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to a replacement of the welfare system with a national system of a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty.
If you want to have a safety net for those people then fine, start a private charity.  Private charities are much better since they can't just be bought off by people like governments can and they have to compete in a market.  With government they force you to give your money with taxes, so this makes it possible to buy off the politicians and become the recipient of the money.  This is why corporations get huge corporate welfare, and banks get banker bailouts.  
Also getting rid of the taxes and socialism, allows the free market to be more prosperous which is better for everyone.  If you want the best standard of life for the most amount of people, then capitalism is the answer, and this is backed up by many scientific studies.  Also don't point to things now and how they are bad and then blame capitalism. We do not have free market capitalism right now in America.
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:00:42

In some ways it can be traced on the blockchain.  But there are tools and ways to gain anonymity to escape being tracked. You can see this since often there are thefts of Bitcoin and most of the time nobody ever gets in trouble, which shows the criminals are able to be anonymous enough to get away with it. We need to extend this anonymity to average users and make it easier.  This is why I like the recent advances on this front with the sidechains elements release which features confidential transactions.  If CT can get implemented into Bitcoin's core then there will be very strong anonymity/privacy using CT plus coinjoin, and users will be able to avoid being traced much easier.
I think physical cash can be subverted easier than Bitcoin.  They can track physical dollars using serial numbers as well.  But the big thing is cash can  be seized without a crime needed as we have seen.  This happens to many people pulled over on the highway as well. With Bitcoin, if you encrypt it and back it up somewhere, its basically impossible for them to seize. They also have cash sniffing dogs, and want to make you feel like a criminal by using cash.  The government has even suggested using cash could mean you are a terrorist. 
I think Bitcoin is resistant to being subverted because it can't be stopped by government.  For one it is decentralized and has no central point for them to attack.  Also you can encrypt it so that they cannot seize it.  Also you can use the technology without permission.  With bank accounts you need permission.  Bitcoin is like a bank account and you are the bank, so the only one giving permission is yourself.
Edit: Also with physical cash its hard to hold and transfer large amounts of it.  With Bitcoin you can hide millions or even billions of dollars on a small usb flash drive, or on a paper wallet, or even in a brain wallet.

It seems coinbase is being a bit preemptive.  They are so scared of the regulations, that it seems they are taking even greater precautions than the law demands.  This may have to do with a lot of propaganda around Bitcoin and money laundering and terrorism.  They want to show the government that they are being really vigilant when it comes to monitoring customers.  Otherwise they risk more heavy handed regulation coming their way in the future as we have seen with BitLicense.  
But banks are being pretty invasive lately as well.  To open a bank account you really get grilled with some invasive questions these days, as they are subject to AML/KYC compliance.  Here is a good example: 
Part of the appeal of Bitcoin is you don't need permission to have your own address like with electrum.  You need permission to use coinbase and third party on ramps and off ramps sometimes, but Bitcoin itself is permissionless, which is one of the things I like best about it.

Yeah I believe he is basically the same as his dad, but he is better at playing politics and blending in with the Republican party, while still staying true to his belief in constitutional government.  As a Senator he has really done a good job at forcing the conversation on NSA spying, and other constitutional issues.  He filibustered for 10 hours to prevent the extension of the Patiot Act, and 13 hours to protest the droning of Americans. 
He has been outspoken on declassifying the secret 28 pages about 9/11, which show the connection to the Saudi government and possible coverups.  Also he is outspoken about making the text of the secret TPP trade deal treaty public.  He also thinks politicians should read the bills before they vote on them and has put forward bills and amendments like the Read the Bills Act. He promoted auditing the fed as well.  Also he has criticized the government for helping to fund and arm ISIS.
He also thinks the Department of Education is unconstitutional, and is against the common core curriculum across the country.  He is for reduced penalties for drug users as well, although his rhetoric is not as strong as his father's when it comes to the drug war, probably in an effort to seem less fringe to conservative voters.  He has proposed a 14.5% flat tax plan.  His dad endorses his presidency, and I believe he has a much better shot at winning than his dad did.  I like that his dad was a little more hard core with his beliefs, but he was not as good at playing the political game.  But after seeing Rand's success as Senator of Kentucky and promoting freedom and the constitution, I really like what he is doing. I think if he becomes president we can possibly start to turn this ship around in the right direction and get our country back.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:02:34

If you don't know what Rand Paul is about, he is about freedom.  He is continuing his father Ron Paul's legacy.  He advocates for free markets and limited constitutional government.  He recently spoke for 10 hours straight in a filibuster to prevent some elements of the Patriot Act from being renewed. He believes in privacy and putting an end to NSA spying and violations of the 4th amendment.  He is also against police seizures of money and property when no crime has been committed, saying they violate the 6th amendment right to jury trial.  These are things many Bitcoiners care about.
Here are a couple interesting video interviews, one from the other day to help see what Rand Paul is all about:

Yeah we should complain to the government also.  But sometimes the government doesn't like to listen to the little guy.  So we complain to coinbase, then coinbase doesn't like losing customers and bad press, so they complain to the government and are much more influential than the little guy.

Here is a great video by Greg Maxwell at about 35 minute mark talking about Confidential Transactions: 
One thing I worry about is the pro-regulation crowd who may be against confidential transactions and privacy, in the name of stopping terrorists and money laundering.  I liked Greg Maxwell's rebuttal to this by saying that already we have enough privacy for criminals to be anonymous, but the average honest person does not get any benefits of privacy because they do not go to the lengths that criminals do in order to achieve it.  So adding CT to Bitcoin will allow regular users to have privacy, and the criminals will exist anyways whether we add CT or not.

The Tea Party started out as libertarian, and he was actually at the first tea party event and it was for his dad Ron Paul.  The mainstreamers are the ones infiltrating the tea party trying to make it more mainstream republican.  He is very critical of the drug war, and is for reducing penalties for drug offenders.  He does not go as far as his dad when it comes to the drug war, probably for political reasons.  Of course parents always had the right to choose whether to vaccinate, are you for forced vaccinations?  That is incredibly dangerous to our liberties.

You should be very careful when importing keys to electrum however.

If you are worried so much about following laws, then why does the government not follow the law?  They don't obey the constitution the highest law in the land.  They violate your 4th amendment with illegal NSA spying.  They violate your 2nd amendment with gun control.  They violate your 6th amendment with illegal seizures without a jury trial.  They violate the constitution every time they enforce a drug law.  Why? because there was no constitutional amendment to authorize the drug prohibition, like there was with the 18th amendment authorizing alcohol prohibition.  Why don't you lecture the government about following the law instead of some small time people trying to take part in non violent human interactions?
Dont forget the other unconstitutional agencies like the Department of education, the EPA, the BLM, etc....

What you are describing is basically the same thing as a central bank, and what we have already in the financial system.  It would be too centralized.  Possibly it might be *slightly* better, and slightly less centralized, but it will still be too easy for the nodes to team up and collude.  All it takes is some scandal, or some economic emergency, and then you have them teaming up to change things and run economic policy.  Or you have government pressuring them and since the number of nodes is smaller its easy to control them all with government.  Bitcoin is so much more decentralized that it is much harder to do this type of thing, so it is much more secure and effective when it comes to eliminating counterparty trust.
Blythe Masters one of the "most powerful women on wall street" has an interesting [talk about this]( recently.  She mentions the problem that after the 2008 crisis, things have gotten even more centralized with central points of failure.  She is looking at the "blockchain" for an answer to these problems as well.  I guess I can see them attempting something as you are saying because they are so in denial about Bitcoin, and they hate the politics surrounding Bitcoin.  Also they benefit from the current model of Fed money printing and banker bailouts.  But it just seems that the Bitcoin blockchain is the most decentralized of all, and if these banks want to take advantage of the benefits of a true decentralized system then they are going to need a decentralized blockchain on the level of Bitcoin.

Its a tough issue, and I think he dances around them a bit, since you are right they are very important distractions.

I think he wants the states to take care of it, and handle the laws on gay marriage.

The FullTilt situation was exacerbated by the seizing of millions of dollars from their bank accounts.  The government seized the money and gave it to law enforcement agencies to use in their budgets.  It was PokerStars that later came and bailed them out buying the site and paid off the FullTilt players years later.  The owners of FullTilt were scumbags and running a Ponzi scheme, but this was largely because of the onerous regulations and threats from the government which pushed ownership of existing Poker websites into the hands of shady operators.  Since the enforcement effort, the existing American facing sites have moved to even shadier operators who have also run scams, thanks for the protection.
Also I am pretty sure Howard Lederer the leader of FullTilt and others never got in trouble either, so I don't buy your argument that Preet was a great guy helping us at all.

Neither do I, its a false left/right paradigm that they try to force us into.  But Rand is not a regular Republican.  He is continuing his father Ron Paul's legacy.  Rand believes in freedom and government that is limited by the constitution.  It just seems like common sense that we should follow the constitution and the rules that the country was founded upon.  America was a very free nation, with a lot of prosperity, and that is now dwindling every day.  Lets go back to that model, which our founders risked their lives to promote.

You must misunderstand how the American system works.  The president is not the "head" of the government.  The president is just one branch of a three branch system.  There are three branches of government in the United States, the executive/president, the legislature, and the judicial branch.  All three branches are supposed to share the power and have checks and balances on each other. I hope they still teach this in school.
You must have thought since Obama does a lot of unconstitutional illegal executive orders and acts as dictator that the President is supposed to be the "head" of the government.  Rand Paul hates that our system has been usurped.  He argued that the worst problem in our government today is that we no longer have separation of powers and instead the president acts as dictator.  Hope that is food for your thoughts.  Good day sir.

Other ideas I like about Dr. Paul:
Calling out Obama to declassify the secret blacked out 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report which are believed to link Saudi Arabia to 9/11: 
Calling out ISIS as being created by our own government: 
Also he believes in reading bills before voting on them and believes the trade treaty deal shouldn't be held secret from the public: 
Him standing and speaking for 13 hours, and 10 hours to filibuster the senate to stop dronings of Americans and to prevent the extension of the Patriot Act.
First President to accept Bitcoin of course.
He is the son of his Dad, stays true to his belief in following the constitution.
His joke about putting Clapper and Snowden in the same jail cell.
Also he is against seizures of property and money that violate the 6th amendment right to jury trial.
Declaration of Independence is important for July 4th, this quote sums Rand up: “I want to unleash the American Dream.

Oh so you came here to just be a jerk, nice.  You must feel like a big man.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:02:59
Ohh you mad? Maybe you like central banks and the communist manifesto, and think the Fed quadrupling the money supply since 2008 is a good thing, and banker bailouts are a good thing. Just keep your money in your bank account like the Greeks did, and see what happens.  Hint:  You don't have any money in your bank account, you only have a promise to pay.  
Also Bitcoin may indeed fail one day, but at least we were not cowards who licked boots our whole lives groveling to the government and monopoly banks that run your life.  I can sleep good at night and die happy knowing I am not a coward like you.
Edit:  Also Bitcoin isn't about getting rich, its about moving to an honest system from a corrupted system.  Getting rich is a nice byproduct.  Also you chime on about how Bitcoin might fail, yet the current fiat central bank system is much more likely to fail than Bitcoin because it has become so corrupted as was warned by our Founding Fathers.  Fiat currency systems fail all the time all around the globe, all throughout history.

Every transaction involves a miner putting your transaction into a block.  So this is usually going to require a fee.  But even with Bitcoin, fees are not always needed.  Some transactions have priority and can be sent with zero fees.
It will be interesting to see how sidechains are secured and how the merge mining works.  Perhaps POS will play a large role in securing sidechains.

Thanks for this, not sure why this is downvoted.  I really like the anonymity provided by zerocash.  I just hope that we can work towards the goal of privacy, anonymity, and better fungibility in Bitcoin.  I was really happy that people seemed to be embracing confidential transactions, but I hope that we can go further with a cryptographic solution like zerocash.  I hope zerocash can be embraced the same way, but it seems like there needs to be more discussion about it.

Thank you for referring to my post as euphoria.  Liberty is indeed very euphoric.  Also thinking about 800 years of history and the men and women who risked their lives, and died in the battle for freedom against tyranny is very inspiring.  It culminates to the point we are at today in history.  It is indeed euphoric to honor them, and to continue their legacy by seizing our own freedom using the power of Bitcoin, mathematics, and cryptography.  It is sad though that people like you will dishonor their legacy, it can't be good karma for you.
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:37:14
Anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin are of the utmost importance.  I was glad to see a little progress on this front with the new sidechains elements release and confidential transactions.  I hope these measures and more will be implemented into Bitcoin's core in the future.  I hope for a cryptographic solution some day, and not just mixing, or value blinding.

What are you accepting Bitcoin for? Are you running for office?  Do you have a foundation, charity, or organization that is not illegal?  Then sure I will make a thread for you if common sense dictates, or you can make your own.  The beauty of freedom.  But if someone does not like what you do or say they can censor your thread here, just on a whim. So I guess there is no free speech here.

@_date: 2015-06-13 20:12:26
Bitcoin certainly has its advantages.  I think in an environment where everything is highly illegal, and the government could be waiting around the corner to wreck you and your family's life any moment, then yeah Bitcoin is good because it helps you survive in that environment.
I think Bitcoin has a natural law about it.  Its there and its permissionless, it can't be seized, and government can't really stop that.  Its the same with privacy.  Sure they can pass the Patriot Act and spy on everyone illegally violating the 4th amendment.  But there is also PGP and encryption.  Encryption has a natural law about it, that allows you to take back your privacy, the same way Bitcoin allows you to take back your freedom when it comes to money, finance, and economic activity.
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:03:01
I can sympathize with that sentiment.  But perhaps we should not just blame a piece of paper for what has happened to America.  Maybe we should blame ourselves instead for not remaining vigilant enough.  The founders warned us that "the price of liberty is eternal vigilance"
Also Ben Franklin said "we have a Republic if you can keep it".  They knew that there was always a contest between tyranny and liberty.  They lived through the same times as we are living now.  They suffered tyranny from the British.  Read the [Declaration]( under the indictment and list of grievances against the king.  Its very similar to what is happening today.  Perhaps these things go in cycles.
I do know that looking at history, the American system ushered in an era of freedom that resulted in the greatest technological boom in the history of civilization.  America held a huge percentage of the world's wealth. I believe that is because of the design of the Founders, but also their will to stay vigilant against tyranny.
Also its not the piece of paper of the constitution or Declaration of Independence that matters.  The Declaration says that we have natural rights, given by our Creator.  So there are natural laws and rights that are always there, whether there is a paper or not.

You are just a government loving ideologue, which is why you hope so much that it will be the "blockchain" to win and not Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is naturally opposed to your statist view of the world.  The central bankers and government people have much the same cognitive dissonance as you, which is why they will attempt their own centralized blockchain and fail, and Bitcoin will reign supreme as the true decentralized immutable ledger.

Yes, the divine rights of kings goes back thousands of years and is also evidenced in the bible.  I agree these rights should be extended to all, for we all have natural, inalienable rights, as described in the Declaration of Independence.  It is just that the barons asserted their rights, it was a stepping stone towards the common man asserting their rights as well.  When America was formed, the Founding Fathers also asserted their rights, and much of it was inspired by Magna Carta.  Later African slaves asserted their rights during the end of slavery, and with the civil rights movement. I agree with Thomas Jefferson, all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights. Today it feels like we are asserting our rights, and taking our rightful freedom back by using Bitcoin.  It feels much like a divine right, because it is given to us by mathematics and cryptography.

Well I do agree that giving banker bailout money to the people rather than banks and corporations would be better than what we have now.  But remember that there are some flaws with pure democracy.  A pure "direct democracy" is an interesting concept to think about as well.  But someone said democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what is for dinner, I thought that is a good way to describe it sometimes.  I guess that is why we had a Republic and not a pure democracy, so some rights were guaranteed no matter what the people voted.
People will then mention how slavery was unjust. I agree, and even after slavery ended we still had civil rights issues.  It was the people that needed to change in the end, not the laws, and we still have a ways to go in our society on that front.
An interesting Bitcoin related video by James D'angleo of the World Bitcoin Network shows some flaws in the way our democracy is working because of a lack of secret voting and lobbyist influence:

I hate the state too brother. So how do you suggest we spend our time and energy, if the goal is liberty?  I like agorism, but what else can we do? Interesting how the founding fathers said government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
Another interesting quote by poet William Blake "I must create a system, or be enslaved by another mans".  Perhaps this is why the Founding Fathers created America.  They needed to create a system to repel the tyranny of the British crown. A necessary evil if you will.  They tried to chain the beast down with the constitution. I wish life were simple and there were easy answers, but we just have to put our energy somewhere.

Yeah they want a cashless society. So they can control everything, and also fractionally leverage the money to infinity without you being able to withdraw from the system.  Its happening already in increments.  They are already putting limits on cash withdrawals, and acting like its illegal by seizing it with no crime required.  
But remember they also do not want Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is in essence digital cash.  Its harder for them to control cash whether its digital cash or physical cash.  They want a cashless society meaning a centralized system that requires permission from them to use it.  Bitcoin is permissionless as is all cash, and that is why they hate it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:35:50
Straw man much?  There are constant oppressions on the American people due to regulations and government beaurocrats.  Why don't you read the Declaration of Independence and look at the list of grievances against the king.  Our king government has sent swarms of officers to eat out our substance the same as the Founders said in the Declaration.  The IRS targets people for their political beliefs and also steals the money of old women with [no crime required](  The police are [out of control]( seizing people's money and property to spend it on margarita machines, while violating the 6th amendment right to a jury trial.
The bankers got a blank check for trillions of dollars during the 2008 banker bailouts.  We do not have free markets or freedom.  If you want to start a Bitcoin business in America you are threatened with fines and imprisonment.  If you think this is still a free country, that is pretty amazing.  The reason we are in so much trouble is because trolls like you who are in denial about the state of things.

You would be deranged to think that everything is ok, and there is no risk.  All over the world they are starting bank runs by governments on central banks for their gold.  Even some states like Texas are demanding their gold now from the Fed.  Also a lot of that gold could be fake for all you know.  There are even rumors that there is a lot of fake gold [filled with tungsten](  It would be delusional not to question known liars and fraudsters.
Don't forget that the government seized gold from people in the past, and if you don't hold your gold yourself then there is a much higher risk the government will seize it.

Oh are you one of the "scientists" that are hired by GE to be global warming promoters?  I don't care if most of academia has been brainwashed by professors installed by corporations that benefit from the global warming hoax fraud.  They used to lock people and burn them alive if they said the Earth was round, or the sun was the center of the solar system.
Since you are so lazy and can't look at real research yourself, sure I will google that for you: 
You are a scientist? What are your credentials?  I probably have studied it a lot deeper than you.  The global warming thing is so ridiculous.  I used to be brainwashed too until i really researched it.  There are so many factors that contribute to temperature and climate.  The biggest factor is the sun.  Since we are in a less active period of the sun, we are actually experiencing extreme cold weather.  This last winter was some of the coldest on record.  The global warming proponent's data is always flawed.  There are also so many factors that go into it, like ocean currents, albeto/reflection from clouds and ice, sunspots, the Earth's magnetic field, volcanoes, photosynthesis and lunar cycyles.  Plants breathe CO2 and give off oxygen and humans exhale CO2 and breathe oxygen.  Its called a symbiotic relationship, and the Earth has natural ways to balance itself.  
In the past the Earth has gone through many cycles, and many ice ages.  Usually it is volcanic activity that builds up over thousands of years that contributes to warming, helping the Earth thaw from ice ages.  The reason it builds up is the planet gets so cold in a runaway iceage, and everything turns to white sheets of glacial ice.  It reflects the sun and plants can't grow.  Because the plants cannot grow, they don't absorb the CO2.  So the volcanoes erupt and put out CO2 and it builds up, until finally the ice age thaws out.  Yes CO2 has that effect in large amounts, but the amounts humans produce are ridiculously low compared to that, and its absorbed by further plant growth which thrive in high CO2 environments.  If anything our planet is CO2 deficient because so much of it has been locked up inside fossil fuels.  
To think that any scientists can ever prove that humans are having a warming effect is the biggest hoax the scientific community has seen in centuries.  They thrive on the fact that it cannot be proven false or positive.

This subreddit and bitcointalk.org are the main forums you want to check out.  I think youtube is a good resource too.  You can find some good [resources here]( for news and information.  Mainstream news about Bitcoin can often be misleading or wrong.
As for mining, its very difficult to be competitive these days.  It might take significant investment and knowledge and is always a risk that you may lose money.  Usually people don't recommend it for newbies.  However you could do it as a fun hobby if you want as well, and who knows if you become an expert at it over time, maybe you can be successful with the right amount of investment and timing.
The massive amount of computing power is not just wasting energy.  It is securing a global worldwide immutable ledger and allowing this new technology to exist.  There are other ways to secure ledgers that may or may not be better.  Bitcoin uses Proof of Work.  Look into Proof of Stake (POS) if you want to learn another way in which a ledger can be secured without miners.
Bitcoin is not perfect of course.  There are flaws with anything.  It can be tracked easily, and if you are not careful you may not have a lot of privacy on your transactions.  Also there are 10 minute confirmation times, which makes it harder for some brick and mortar transactions, because of the increase risk of double spends.  The block size debate is a big issue right now as well.  
I think that Bitcoin is improving on those flaws over time.  The advancement of sidechains, and also confidential transactions could solve a lot of the problems of helping Bitcoin to scale, and also providing more privacy and tools to protect against being tracked.  The lightning network could help provide much faster transactions.
Sure you can lose your private key and your coins are gone forever.  But people lose cash in housefires, or gold on sunken ships.  This happens with lots of forms of money.  Bitcoin is divisible to at least 8 decimal places (and possibly further), so the amount in circulation does not much matter.
If I were you I would just dip your toe in a bit.  Buy a small amount, maybe 20 dollars worth.  Get a coinbase or circle account and link your bank account.  Then you can purchase bitcoin.  Learn to download your own wallet like Electrum, Multi-bit or Bitcoin Core wallet. Learn how to send and receive Bitcoins to your own wallets.  Learn how to secure your Bitcoins against hackers.  You do not want to invest a lot without knowing how to secure it.  I think hardware wallets like Ledger Wallet and Trezor are good because its easy to secure your coins and make them pretty much immune against hackers.

The system has been usurped.  The Founders always said that the price of freedom was eternal vigilance. Our system was a Republic not a pure Democracy and it was the best system that ever existed, spurring a technological and industrial revolution the likes of which the world could never have imagined. Unfortunately Americans are too busy soaking up liberal propaganda from the unconstitutional education system, television, and video games these days, and they are not being vigilant about their liberties.  Everything the government does is the opposite of capitalism and the antithesis of the individual rights and government limitations outlined in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence.  This is why there are banker bailouts, NSA spying, illegal wars, regulatory burdens, civil asset forfeitures with no crime required.  The constitution is trash to this government, and the people are to blame for allowing this usurpation to continue.

Its such a shame that we do not even have the freedom to innovate and start our own businesses in America without worrying about attacks from regulators and governments.  Thanks so much for your pledge, it means a lot.  If everybody can donate even a smaller amount, it will add up significantly.  Small things add up, maybe sooner than later we can get our country back, and our freedom back to innovate and create jobs.  This country was founded on capitalism, and because we enjoyed so much freedom it helped usher in one of the greatest technological revolutions in the history of mankind.  This country was not founded by forcing the greatest minds and innovators offshore.  Good luck, and thanks again for the pledge!

I see a lot of new stuff.  There seems to be progress being made on the blocksize debate with BIP 100.  Also the sidechain elements release was huge.  Also confidential transactions are really important for privacy and fungibility.  These are all reasons for investors to start becoming more serious about investing in Bitcoin.
Also Greg Maxwell made a good point when discussing confidential transactions and the importance of privacy for commercial businesses and thus investors, starting around 35 min mark: 
But also the key point at 38:15: "Even the most boring traditional institutions look at this and say I dont want to be transacting in a way where all of my moves are telegraphed by my transactions": 
So I think there are definitely big reasons for more money to be invested with these developments.  I think people who are not very knowledgeable about the day to day progress of the technology are trying to correlate the price increase to other events like Grexit and I think they are wrong.

I heard one time they raided someone over saying "tonight is going to be da'bomb" on twitter when going out with friends to party. So I would like to specify that by promoting this MoneyBomb, there is no intent to do violence of any kind.
A MoneyBomb is not a real bomb. It is just a day that everyone picks to donate money on that day. Its ridiculous that you have to specify this type of thing in a so-called free country. But with the atmosphere today, I feel it should be done.

Also in an unprecedented move, in 2011 Preet Baharara was the one behind the seizure of millions of dollars from PokerStars and FullTilt bank accounts.  This means even foreign Bitcoin businesses could have their accounts targeted as well. Bahararar's office sends out agents to [over 25 countries]( in investigations and brings them back to Manhattan to face charges. No wonder the smart Bitcoin businesses are blocking NY customers after the bit-license.

It was 378 billion by Wachovia, and nobody got in trouble, and they only got a small fine less than the profits received from the laundering: 
That is only 1/3 of a trillion in that one case.  They even had a suitcase sized hole in one of the banks designed specifically for a type of suitcase used by the cartels to deposit suitcases of money through.  If this is one case that we know about for 1/3 of a trillion, then you can bet the amount is well into the trillions added up, especially over the years.

Which ideology? following the constitution is far out there now?  Long way we have come towards tyranny.  True it would be better if he kept some of the Bitcoin.  Perhaps we could convince him of this in the future.  There could be many benefits for a campaign to hold Bitcoin.  Especially when bank accounts can be seized and that sort of thing.  Bitcoin could be an emergency stash that cannot be seized.  Probably there are other benefits as well.

Awesome idea!  Glad to see grassroots efforts helping to promote the Rand Paul Bitcoin Money Bomb this July 4th.  I think some imagery dealing with the Declaration of Independence or Founding Fathers would be cool.

Well I don't know if that is his exact viewpoint, he did make a tongue in cheek joke about putting Snowden and Clapper in the same cell for the same period of time. He also seems to sympathize with the reason why Snowden did what he did. So people can see what he really stands for when it comes to Snowden, here is a good interview about it at 6:30 mark: 
Rand also has an amendment to make it easier for whistleblowers like Snowden to come forward without breaking the law.

This is interesting, but you wonder if they would have invested in this without considering the possibility of regulating what items are on OpenBazaar.

I am interested in the certain constraints some of these systems have.  I know ring signatures are said to cause a lot of bloat.  Also I think the confidential transactions are said to be ready for pruning already while zerocash is not.  I wonder what the chances are of ever getting full privacy and fungibility built into Bitcoin.  I think its super important.
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:56:37




This seems wrong to me.  To use the sidechain you will sort of burn an amount of bitcoin, locking it so it can't be used.  Then present that cryptographic proof to the sidechain, and it will allow you to create an equivalent amount of sidechain coins.  Then you can reverse the process to lock the sidechain coins and recreate the coins on the regular blockchain.  This is called a 2-way peg.
Someone could do billions of dollars worth of transactions possibly using some colored coin asset using a few satoshis, but what you were saying doesn't seem right.  
Possibly the OP may be referring to the fact that some people claim that a sidechain could be used as a way to escape the main chain, should mining ever become too centralized and corrupted.  Here is a video by Andreas Antonopoulos addressing this question:

Consider the results of socialism, which we basically have already.  Or maybe its more like fascism, the marriage of corporations and the state.  Socialism allows the government to give out the money, so then it becomes super profitable for lobbyists and corporations to buy the politicians off so that they can be the recipients of that money.  Hope that is food for thought.

Another good thing about Rand Paul, is he is fighting to get the government to declassify a 28 page redaction from the 9/11 commission report.  The report is largely believed to establish ties between Saudi Arabian funders and Al Qaida, establishing a chain of liability around the attacks:

That is your opinion, and not fact.  Also one thing is for sure Thomas Jefferson the author of the Declaration of Independence believed that all men had God given rights given by their Creator.  He called them inalienable rights.  Also if you read the [Declaration]( then you will realize that the paper is irrelevant.  The paper is try to assert rights and freedmos that already existed naturally.  So does Thomas Jefferson believe we should also rewrite the natural laws handed down by our Creator? I think not.

So you are admitting its the same as the current system, which I already told you.

If regulations are working, then why did the banks get away with a blank check worth trillions during the banker bailouts of 2008?  Notice Mt Gox is no longer with us, yet the too big to fail banks are still here because of bailouts. Also the banks got caught laundering trillions in drug money for murderous cartels and only got a slap on the wrist paying a small fine, which was less than the profits received from the laundering. In a regulated world you have a lot bigger scams going on.  The free market is the best thing to regulate things.  you have "regulatory capture" which Patrick Byrne often goes into depth on.  Anybody with half a brain got their coins out of gox, the writing was written on the wall.

Well look what happened to Charlie Shrem when he thought he was safe, and tried to play nice with regulators visiting Lawsky every week.  Then he got snapped up. You can argue he made some illegal mistakes, but still look what happens when you try to ignore the perils.
Look at the comments against the Bit-license from prominent members of the community.  Erik Vorhees for example also was forced to leave the country citing regulatory burdens.  Roger Ver is another example.  People are fleeing America in droves.  Even the wealthy and rich people know to put all of their stuff off shore as not to deal with the regulatory burden.

Yeah its been a slow march towards tyranny.  But this happened before to America back when the king was tyrannizing the colonies.  But I see your point about the post-collapse solution.

Probably because there are a lot more interesting things than the price, like the type of freedom that Bitcoin allows.  We now have digital cash, a permissionless currency that allows you to hold your own money without it being seized by anyone.  You can send money around the globe and no permission is needed.  Those that love freedom see Bitcoin as a tool and technology that advances liberty.
Also many people here got into Bitcoin when the price was well under 100 dollars, or even under 10 dollars.  A lot of holders are not under water in their investments, and with $100s of millions in VC money pouring in, NASDAQ experimenting with Bitcoin, Paypal looking at it, Presidential candidates accepting it, sidechains in the pipeline, there is a lot to look forward to.
Also Bitcoin is still in the distribution phase with 25 bitcoin being mined every 10 minutes.  With that type of inflation on a small currency its pretty impressive that the price remains very strong.  If the price went to $10,000, and then dropped to $5,000 you would still claim victory and troll us about the "elephant in the room" that the price dropped 50%

If you don't believe in God it doesn't matter.  There is still a [Natural Law]( of the universe determined by Nature.  Natural Law has self evident truths to it.  They are obvious and common sense.  The Declaration speaks of this Natural Law.  Also the constitution and Bill of Rights are an attempt to assert some of those natural rights and record some of them on paper.  However the documents explicitly state that there are more rights that may not be listed.
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:27:54
I agree in a sense, and hoping that would be true.  But we don't know for sure.  Maybe if things get really bad we just turn into a super prison and can never get out of it.  I think morally we have a duty to resist.  But also we need to get these ideas out there, so that when it does collapse people will see we warned them about it.  Then they will see the answer is limited constitutional government and free market capitalism.
Look at the [Declaration of Independence]( Please read the whole thing.  Independence Day is in the next couple of days.  What do you think would happen if the Founders had laid down to the king and did nothing?  We wouldn't have had the success that America had leading the entire world in inventions, technology, wealth, and prosperity.  The whole idea of the Declaration is you need to resist tyranny, and declare your Natural rights..  They said the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.  So lets not lay down and do nothing.  That is not what our nation's Founders would do.
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:19:45
Yeah Rand Paul liked the idea of the Freedom Act, but he was also forced to come out against it because of the way it was written.

Even if he does not win, at least it legitimizes Bitcoin by now being part of a presidential election.
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:36:43
Go ahead and mock.  Win or lose we are promoting the ideas of liberty and common sense.  The intellectuals are on our side, the rest are busy watching television doing whatever they are programmed to do.  America is supposed to be a Republic not a Democracy.  A democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what is for dinner.  When 51% can vote to take away the rights of the 49% you do not have freedom.  
The reason America is getting worse is because of socialist ideas.  The [Cloward and Piven Strategy]( is designed to overload the welfare system making everybody dependent and poor so they can bring in your socialist utopia.  Socialism and big government is the problem, and Liberty and constitutional government is the answer.
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:09:52
I think you are not realizing the importance of a blocksize increase.  Big institutions, markets, and billionaires are not going to invest or utilize the technology if it can only do 7 transactions per second. If they start to see that Bitcoin can adapt and scale then it will open up a whole new world of investment.  Also what Darft said is right about the fees.
We at least need an increase now, and hopefully in the future we will have something like Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin for high frequency trading on markets like NASDAQ.

Senator Paul is a doctor himself.  He understands that free markets are what provide the best care for the most people.  Socialized healthcare is a nightmare.  The Affordable Care Act did not make your care affordable.  Government involvement is the problem.  More government involvement in the form of single payer will just make it worse.  Senator Paul routinely gives free surgeries for chairty in places like Guatamala and the United States.  Charity and free market are the solutions, not more government.  The reason costs are so high is because of government involvement.  Take government out of it and watch your health care costs plummet, and watch medical innovation soar.  The reason America had the most advanced medical system is because we had a lot more freedom before the government slowly encroached on us and strangled our economy and free market.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:25:32

You need to understand that its not just constitutional government that allows for freedom and prosperity.  Its also the people's will to be free and assert their freedoms, and to assert the constitution.  We are failing at that today.  It also depends on the people to be vigilant against tyranny.  The Founders said this over and over again, and warned us that constitutional government would be doomed to fail if the people themselves do not lust for freedom.  It may not be a perfect system, but it was the best there ever was, and it lead to more prosperity, and technological advances than the world could ever have imagined.

It is needed now for ISIS, because [ISIS was created and funded and armed]( by our current administration's as well as the neocons' actions.  Senator Paul has said that ISIS is so strong now that we should declare War against them, and I tend to agree.  But we should admit how ISIS was created and made to be strong.

I believe its a precedent in the court of public opinion.  Since before nobody ever believed it and tried to debunk and deny that it was happening, and now it is being admitted out in the open, but now its for our safety.

Oh I understand now.  While he believes in traditional marriage, he has said it should be left to the states to decide. Just because he doesn't believe in something morally does not mean he thinks it should be illegal.  At the end of the day he thinks people should be able to do what they want, as long as they are not hurting anybody else. He thinks government should get out of the marriage business, and people should be free to enter into private contracts if they wish.
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:51:36
Since it worked so well all throughout history, lol.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:36:13
Not true, he thinks people should be able to enter into private contracts with each other.  That is all that marriage is. He thinks governments should get out of the marriage business.  But he also thinks states should be able to do what they want when it comes to marriage, because states are supposed to represent the people within that state, and its how our country and constitution was designed with the 10th amendment.
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:37:06
That is why the state is supposed to be chained down by the constitution to limit its power.  Like fire, government is a dangerous servant, and a fearful master.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:01:45
Well I think part of the reason for his position on this is to appeal more to conservative voters who don't want to be soft on national defense.  He plays more politics than his dad.  But defending our country is one of the few things the government is allowed to do within the confines of the Constitution.  However Senator Paul believes we should declare War and have congressional approval which never happens for military involvement anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:47:39
I think it depends on how that money is being used.  If its truly for defense like the constitution allows, then it would save American lives.  If instead the money is used to prop up governments in countries that hate us, or to [help fund ISIS]( or [to help grow poppies in Afgnanistan]( then defense spending can be very bad.

Well presidential candidate Senator Rand Paul stands for constitutional government, and is very against NSA spying.  He even [filibustered]( speaking for 10.5 hours to delay the extension of the unconstitional Patriot Act because of illegal spying.  If you want to get your country back then support Senator Paul.  He is also the first presidential candidate to [accpet Bitcoin](  We are even having a [Bitcoin MoneyBomb]( for him on July 4th in celebration of Independence Day and the founding of America.  Please consider supporting the Constitution, [Declaration of Independence]( and Rand Paul this July 4th.
Edit: Senator Paul even [sued President Obama]( over illegal NSA spying.  This guy is legit.
Also I don't think we should just give up and forfeit to the status quo.  Lets not lay down, that is what they want us to do.  Lets stand up and resist this tyranny.  Even if we fail, at least we kept our honor.  Rand is our man.

Studies show that capitalism provides the best quality of life for the most amount of people.  Why do you think America was so prosperous and ushered in the industrial and technological revolution?  It raised the standard for everyone, and inequality was far less than today, now that crony capitalism has taken over.  Its a result of socialist government.  Once you have government handing out the money, it messes with the free market and causes special interests to buy off government, and write laws so they become the recipient of that money.  Hope you understand.
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:59:29
Probably, and there were NSA whistleblowers before Snowden as well.  William Benny is a great example.  But recently its become more widely known and even discussed in congress and other places.  But that can be a bad thing too, because they are now setting the precedent that all of this is ok.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:07:51
Actually we are supporting constitutional government and the ideas within the [Declaration of Independence](  Maybe you should read our founding document to understand.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:50:17
God's Natural Law as spoken of in the Declaration is what is flawless.  The constitution and Bill of Rights is an attempt to assert those Natural inalienable rights.  Maybe you should read the [Declaration](  Then maybe you will understand the importance of it, as well as the relevance of Senator Paul, and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:17:20
What do you mean? He filibustered for 10.5 hours protesting the extension of the Patriot Act. He even sued Obama over illegal spying.  He has been in heated battles over civil assert forfeiture, and other problems of the police state. He is agains the TSA. He has criticized the government for funding and arming our enemies like ISIS and Al Qaeda.  he filibustered the droning of americans for 13 hours.

If you want to know the dangers of socialized medical care, learn about [death panels]( as promoted by Bill Gates.  They are going to deny people care so they can save money to hire more teachers for the brainwashing education system.

The fact is the USD money supply has over quadrupled since 2008: 
We saw what happened in 2008.  Even Blythe Masters who engineered much of the 2008 crisis with her credit default swap scams has warned that things are now much more centralized, meaning the risk for another bigger collapse is probably inevitable.  The too big to fails have gotten even bigger.  So when we do finally have to face reality its going to be much worse.  The longer we wait the worse its going to be.  We are already seeing what happens when people trust in banks and government too much in Greece and Cyprus.  
I think about the pain people are going to experience like an old woman in greece who waited 3 hours outside the bank to get her money, then they came out and said the bank is closing and she fainted and they took her away in an ambulance.  Our families are going to suffer under this, and the longer we wait the worse its going to be.  If people could wake up and use Bitcoin instead, or at least hold their own assets instead they would be prepared for what I think it inevitable.  If its not inevitable, at least Greece is proving its a major risk that people should actually think about instead of living in la la land.  Its already starting, and those people in Greece are learning a painful lesson.

Yes but unfortunately the law forces them to use their best effort to collect yout identity.

Pretty much, why is it so hard for people to understand?  Our country was founded on freedom.  Land of the free they called it.  We were the most prosperous nation because of our free market capitalist system.
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:46:18
ISIS has become a threat because of our government funding, arming, and training them in places like Syria.
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:54:30
Well I agree that terrorism is a false threat and you have a better chance of getting killed by a honey bee sting, or a falling air conditioner.  However ISIS has grown significantly and seems to be a far worse threat than Al Qaeda.  Just as they planned eh?

Please everyone take time to read the [Declaration of Independence]( today.  Sadly many people [do not even know]( what “4th of July” is really celebrating.  We should take a moment to remember what our Founders did.  By signing that paper they were risking everything.  If the war was lost they would have been sentenced to death by the king.  They helped usher in an era of freedom that was responsible for the biggest boon to civilization the world had ever seen.  America led the world in wealth and prosperity.  We had the most inventions.  Our capitalist free market system spurred the industrial and technological revolution. 
Rand Paul supports a restoration of that old America.  He [filibustered]( speaking for 10.5 hours to delay the extension of the unconstitional Patriot Act because of illegal NSA spying.  Senator Paul even [sued President Obama]( over illegal NSA spying. He [has pledged]( to eliminate the unconstitutional Department of Education, and [audit the Fed](  He filibustered for [13 hours]( protesting the use of drones on American citizens.  He has blasted others for voting on Bills without reading them, and has supported the [Read the Bills Act]( He has supported the repeal of Obamacare saying [we should try freedom instead]( and called for the [declassifcation]( of 28 redacted pages from the 9/11 commission report that is believed to prove a Saudi Arabian link to the attacks.  He has also [spoken out]( against the secret TPP trade treaty deal, saying that it should be public before being voted on.  He is for states rights when it comes to marijuana laws and has even [raised money]( with the Marijuana industry in Colorado.  
Rand stands for freedom, if you want to get our country back, then please [support his campaign]( and spread the word.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:58:44
I am glad Sanders is against NSA spying, but I don't like how his solution is MORE government on healthcare and other things.  I along with Senator Paul think the better solution is LESS government, and govenrment that is chained down by the constitution as this country was designed.  More government only makes the problems worse.
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:20:58
Well I understand your point that he plays more politics than his dad.  I like his dad better too, because he just stood for the truth and didn't play politics here and there.  I think Rand is basically has the same beliefs as his dad, but he is just using a bit different strategy.  He is trying to remain true to his belief in constitutional government, while blending in with the Republican party and mainline conservatives.
I think Ron Paul was the one that would have been against the civil rights act, and business owners refusing blacks.  People called him racist for that, but he has that view because of his belief in freedom.  He thinks society itself can fix these problems without needing laws.  Rand Paul I think takes more of a political stance and says he wouldn't remove those laws.  I think he believes the same as his dad on the issue, but is just compromising because of what is politically correct today.  I think he may have changed his opinion to be more politically correct over time, as [this article]( outlines.
I can understand criticism for that, but also I can see that his tactics are effective.  He is able to appear more mainstream while still advancing his core beliefs in liberty and the constitution.  For this reason he has a much better chance of winning the presidency than his dad had.
Also as for drones, he [filibustered]( drones for 13 hours, and has spoken our loudly against them being used on citizens.
