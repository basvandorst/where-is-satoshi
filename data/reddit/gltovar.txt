I would be an interesting en devour to create a non-profit trust worthy source to research, investigate, and rate charities use of donor funds. I am hopeful that it would be less of a which hunt and more of a help to streamline efforts so less money is wasted.  An example is food shelters turning to an auctioning system to improve the type of food that different areas around the country need: 
To take it a step further, offer (free?) contracting and counseling to improve the charity, finally open sourcing what improvements were done so other charities and business could review the methodologies to improve their systems.
So instead of just straight up blasting money to these places, you could start a trend that improves money use across the board. With the information opensouced/shared your reach can be greater than you alone could reach.
Feel free to PM me, I'd enjoy exploring different less obvious ways to utilize this money in ways that have some great social ROI.

Nice. I had a similar idea for something like this that replaced floor vent grates and did things like crunch numbers for folding at home. Then the  air coming out would get an extra boost of heat to help heat the room.

Say something like square iPad POS would take a photo and record a transaction I'd when the customer signs. Then that gets backed up off the iPad so you could store months or years worth of photos? Why would a charge back still get through?

Not to mention the black out that would have rendered Bitcoin unavailable to use for the majority of the population

Would have to be a Sat phone. Cell towers require electricity.

I seriously don't understand why people use venmo over square cash. I can't ever think of a reason to have my payments telegraphed on some social feed. Especially when something like this could happen

How does this conflict with FDIC insurance?

Love the idea of this place paying via western union instead of bitcoin
