True, but that's not it either. There are something like 40m distinct addrs.

I think the idea is that the redeem script will begin with op_true so that old clients will accept it (but not really validating the script) and new clients would skip past the op_true and actually evaluate the rest of the script.. But I guess that both old and new clients see the same script hash address. To spend a p2sh output the script must be revealed, but in the case of old clients that only process the op_true part the signatures would not be required.

Probably the same thing?

Hmm you sure? Silkroad was in 2011 probably some agents would have been tasked with investigating..

No. Bip141 could be activated at any time.. But requires 95% of the hash rate to signal. Combined the supporters of bip148 and segwit2x could just activate it directly just by starting to signal bip141. Instead they are going to try and activate it by orphaning non segwit blocks.. That means the effective signaling for bip141 immediately goes to 100% and it activates (assuming either can muster enough hash rate to stay ahead of non segwit signaling nodes). Bip148 has a time based activation on Aug 1st. The whole thing is political nonsense and makes little sence - especially when if I'm right the Nov hardfork of segwit2x fails to achieve a meaningful following.

The real question is what will they do about Nov 15 (or whenever the HF might be)

It'll be like  except with a different block size and starting at a different block height and using the original proof of work mining. Also bitcore didn't preserve small balances choosing instead to clear out the utxo pool.

Localbitcoins.com is usually pretty safe for buyers as long as you use their escrow and pick sellers with lots of good feedback. Some sellers may not take funds from a company account but tbh you'll have problems with doing that on exchanges too. I would recommend wiring the money to yourself and then transferring from there.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:37:16
You could reveal the script (which contains the hash of the public key), the public key and the signature of the message you want to sign. That would prove ownership.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:40:21
Wiring money to yourself has no tax implications if you are merely acting on behalf of the company as a bitcoin purchasing agent. The bitcoin would be owned by the company. Check with an accountant, and I guess if what you're doing is also illegal in some way you might not want to draw attention to your connection to the company, but just because you help some company get btc it doesn't mean you got the money as income or ever owned the btc personally..

Bitcoincash.org is still doing a HF. It probably won't be a very notable coin, but if you withdraw from coinbase before the HF, you'll be able to sell it if any exchanges bother to list it.

Could be the corrupt us agents Carl force and Shaun bridges used their agent credentials to get access to the mtgox Colo server to get the wallet file.. Then coordinated with Alexander to offload the coins.

There's always localbitcoins.com - you can often find deals with 5% premium.. Not bad if you're in a hurry.

Soft forks can create a chain split in which you end up with two coins. Hard forks always create a new coin. Bip148 and segwit2x both force activation of an already deployed softfork bip141 (segwit) by orphaning (refusing to build the chain on top of any block that doesn't signal bip141 readiness). Segwit2x will start this forcing procedure once 80% of the hash rate signals readiness for bip91. Bip148 will start forcing on Aug 1st unless bip141 is already active by then. Segwit2x is trying to beat bip148 so that miners can say they activated bip141. Assuming this happens there will not be a chain split as everyone will activate bip141 including all the already deployed bitcoin core nodes. This is the most likely outcome IMO. If segwit2x fails to activate before Aug 1st then bip148 will attempt activation in the same way. Bip148 currently does not have much hash power, but it is only fighting the non signaling part of the network, so if it obtained 30% of the hash rate it might still succeed in activating bip141 in which case again no chain split. If it fails to get enough hash rate and the non segwit chain remains with a higher hash rate then there will be a chain split and two coins. Also if miners continue to run segwit2x after segwit activation then there is also a hardfork built into it for three months later (mid Nov). Also bitcoincash.org are going to do an unconditional hardfork on Aug 1st so there will be at least one fork then. Also maybe bitcoinabc will do a hardfork. Also  is an already existing and trading bitcoin hardfork. There will be a few bitcoin, but probably not many important ones.

Securities are regulated. Probably not just anyone can start issuing them regardless of what technology is used. If those who do issue them want to they probably don't need explicit authorization from the sec to change database providers. I think this report is pretty much what I expected to see.. Most icos are trying to avoid being securities by basically offering no benefit to the buyer. That may succeed in making them not be securities but ultimately when the bubble pops people will not buy stuff that has no benefit other than selling it to a greater fool. If you allow tokens to vote or receive dividends that gives people a reason to buy them, but unfortunately it makes them into securities. Maybe some jurisdictions will regulate with a light enough touch that tiny startups can start issuing securities, but that probably isn't the current reality.

It isn't the right thing. It isn't about compromising. If someone wants to fork to a worthless altcoin noone can stop them.. Hell it won't even be the shittiest altcoin and probably will retain some value.

I don't get it, there are something like 44million unique utxos but this page is graphing numbers between around 500k-750k.

Of course. Just because 80% of the miners leave doesn't mean bitcoin will somehow not exist anymore for the remaining 20%.

I think hungryhouse.co.UK accepts bitcoin so does scan.co.UK. mostly its used to gamble (sports betting, casino games) and to speculate on other cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens.

If you withdraw it you might be able to sell the split coins on some other exchange. They probably won't have much value, but you won't have the option if you stay in coinbase.
