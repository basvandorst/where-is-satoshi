also make sure you’re not on the bitcoin cash tab. i’ve done that before and freaked out seeing i had no cash or coins
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:27:14
check under orders. do you have a pending order?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:06:46
someone accidentally put in a buy order for $17,250 instead of a sell order and the trade was instantly executed raising the price for a brief moment. Imagine being that guy.

i believe, not positive, that they hold the majority of their coins in cold storage and those are not insured, but the ones not in cold storage are insured. 
Again i’m not positive, i only day this because the wording of their terms of service gave me that impression.

i’ll buy 5.25 for $99k

i think when the prices start to move really quickly coinbase stops using the live gdax price and starts using a price a good distance away from the live price.

do not ever sell bitcoins to someone via paypal. they can reverse the charge and you’ll never get your bitcoins back. DO NOT DO THIS
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:08:56
I saw it hit 7990 with a massive 1000btc wall at 8k so i said to myself "no way its going to hit 8k, im going to make a coffee".  5 minutes later i come down and its $8040. Blew my mind.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:35:25
million dollar question 
i’d wait to buy in at $7290 and sell at $7355 then buy back in at $7199 and hodl

This is a shitty article because in the first graph, why is the google trends data starting around 4800 when the bitcoin data is starting around 2500.
I stopped reading at that point
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:31:07
