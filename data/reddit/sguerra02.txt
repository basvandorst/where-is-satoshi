So November 8th Bitcoin neared 8k and then dropped and started to settle to about 5k over the next 4 days, each day dropping in value. What are the chances we're not done with this exponential climb and it shoots up again in a day or a week?

Is there a way to see what the price of Bitcoin was when I traded it in GDAX? I've got the time stamp and quantity but can't find anything that will give me an accurate number of the price

Not at the moment, shooting upwards now

Being that all of us use the internet and there's a large number of users from the U.S. I'd suggest donating twords someone fighting for net neutrality

Took all my litecoin and traded it to Bitcoin. Put in a deposit to buy more later this week. Then watched litecoin triple while I have 0 in it... That takes talent

The Altcoins are traded with Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin is going down people unload it into the altcoins to avoid the loss in the drop and when enough people are doing it the altcoins go up in price. When Bitcoin is rising it's the opposite

Yep still new to this. But opportunities missed like that make you learn quick. Ended up buying some back and I'm up since then just not nearly like I would've been

Yes and no, I've had my bank and credit card linked since 2014, sad I only bought $5 back then but I had no job. Logged back in when it was around 7k and had no issues whatsoever

Don't get too down, that'll happen from time to time. I am new to this too and I realized that trying to trade everything or large chunks isn't working for me. I've only lost out on about .02 btc but i had a lot less interested into it. I try take it as a lesson learned.

It takes a while for it to show in Binance, I've done this from Gdax to bincace a few times and its usually around 30mins to a few hours to see it in the account

I'm surprised I haven't seen this anywhere on this sub. Even if the exchanges are low bandwidth a lot of people get their news on what's happening in crypto from other sites like YouTube.
