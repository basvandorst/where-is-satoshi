Worth noting however that countries with high inflation usually don't have the general want of adopting a currency that as of right now can be turned down by anyone or the widespread access to the mediums required for this to work without becoming a major clusterf**k.

It's hard to make that distinction with hyperinflation.
Now you're middle class, next year you are only middle class if you money went into buying things that still hold value.
That is why hyperinflation is so damn scary, you can go from comfortable to broke unless you have material wealth (such as houses, cars, appliances, even jewellery) and not virtual wealth [is that the right term for it?] (such as currencies) .

There is the problem that unless you are wealthy enough that you can get by without that money, the plan does not work. 
So rich people could theoretically hold down on the inflation via the use of alternate currencies (they already do that with investments), while everyone else is screwed. It also does nothing to actually slow down the inflation.

100F is just a bit above your body temperature.
On stock clocks and voltage, a pc can run 8-10 hours a day at double that temperature for well over 5 years before things start going south.
I realize this comment is old but people still use this thread for reference and 100F is lower than the idle temperatures for most systems.

I figured that.
Sorry if I came off as the pedantic jerk I sometimes post as.
