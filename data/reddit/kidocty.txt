When you buy every month do you take it out of the exchange straight away and move it to a wallet or do you wait until you have a few months in there?
I’m thinking about taking up this strategy along side my retirement plan

I’m trying to low cost average so I’m not worried about previous prices I’m thinking of what my next price will be. Also silicon is a great alternative to ceramic mugs. It doesn’t get hot and it bounces!

Surely everyone wants it to go down so we can buy more and then have it go up?

It'll probably still happen. I'm expecting a big dump this evening or early next week

I’m in the US but moved from the UK and I miss how my UK bank account used to operate. 
I’m with Bank Of America and I feel so out of control of my own money it’s ridiculous. 
If I want to transfer money the same day to a different bank it’s $30 no matter the amount and I can only do that during business hours

But.. there's people out there

OP is trying to show their disgust in the current banking situation. I feel this way every time I’m charged a transaction fee or when it takes a week for me to move money between my own accounts at the same bank
