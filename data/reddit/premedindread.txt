He's actually right.  You're making it harder to experience DCA if in the future the price drops again - and even if the price goes up.

Does this ever work? I mean, I've successfully sent BTC to myself, but I've never tried posting my address.  16mu9KQtKm9RfvDFbPYTmkoNz9sF1zcJKG

Is this a real post?  Why would your wife and kids leave you over bitcoin?  OP, I hope you're alright, and I hope you conveyed to your wife and kids that nothing has yet happened to your assets.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:44:57
To be fair, I think he's making a point that OP is being a dick.

Can I have a bitcoin?  Seems like the moral is crime does pay - or, at the very least, crime doesn't hurt.

Thank you for this.  I've been using Coinbase. What is the easiest wallet to manage?  I've looked, and all of them look so complicated compared to Coinbase.

Any idea what's causing the explosion? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:10:18
"accidentally" includes how many BTC he has

What's going on with the sentiment in this subreddit? Usually everyone is circlejerking each other off during a drop. Why's this time so different?

I follow the do unto others rule, but in reverse:
Would they have given you your refund if you didn't complain?  Wait until they complain and issue the refund.
Otherwise wait 90 days or however long they refuse refunds and then keep it.

I literally sold yesterday the bitcoins coin base wouldn't release (kept locking and holding my account) for months just so I could get everything out and be done with them.
They had half of all my coins so kinda bummed but whatever. I'm a holder who switched from coin base to Gemini and keep my coins in Wasabi as recommended by you guys
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:48:51
Is Wasabi a safe way to store one's bitcoins?

For me it's just a lump sum that goes into my account. I budget it accordingly but if I didn't, my own (ie my parents') money and the loan money is indistinguishable. So I'm sure some people do this but given how little they give you for living, I bet most are using Mommy and Daddy for BTC

Agreed! remind me! in 2 weeks (I don't think it'll fall in two weeks, just don't want to lose this post)
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:27:14
This is savagely beautiful! If I could give you more than one upvote, I would.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:37:38
That's what I've been doing.  Now I'm hungry and want to invest more (not beyond what I'm willing to lose, but reallocating some dull investments).  Just want to know if I should wait or just have a recurring buy setup on Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:15:17
I was waiting for this! Buy Buy BUY!
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:44:59
Give everyone who posts here 1 BTC. Girls like generous guys.
I'm waiting.

I'd keep it and let it grow.  Then, when I need it to pay down my ever-growing debt, take it with the growth that BTC will have. That $100 will be $1000 come next year!

BTC --&gt; profit --&gt; Gyft for amazon giftcards when I buy something --&gt; awesome
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:19:16
How are the dividends given out? As BTCs?  And where are the BTCs sent?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:13:04
Yeah, that'd be a pain, but with a generated password history, I wouldn't call it cracking.  See here in the "Update 1Password's Local History" section:
It shows you a history of all the passwords 1Password has generated, regardless of whether you saved them or not.  If KeePass has the same thing, then they might not need to crack it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:33:30
What you just described yourself doing... That's what most people are supposed to be doing with money.
Just keep that in mind. =)
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:19:17
Really? Please share! I would love to do this!

Sigh, 26k could get me out of debt.  With all this accumulated wealth, one of the most awesome things fellow Bitcoin users could do is give it to those of us who wish just to break even.  Imagine that, a goodwill gesture that makes BTC even more awesome.
This is cool, but I don't know how badly that kid needed it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:08:30
Ouch, I wonder if someone could crack it for you or something.  I find it hard to believe that there's NO way to get your coins back, and it's a sizable sum to find someone to grab it.
Are you sure KeePass doesn't have a "generated passwords in the past" section? I use 1Password, and every password, whether it is used or not, is saved.

I left BoA long ago.  Ally Bank has been very good to me, though cash deposits are the only thing lacking.

Yeah, when the crash comes, no one will really predict it.  The one who predicted it will just happen to be the one who published his post that particular day.  Bitcoin apparently has crashed every second of every hour since inception, if we looked at all the articles.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:43:37
I'm enjoying this.  I'm buying 0.1 BTC with every drop of $20.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:43:02
I wish there were more cerebral places that take bitcoins!  Rather than risk/chance, it's all about how good you are.  Maybe a site where you gamble on Chess games (though preventing cheating would be difficult).
I don't like chance.  Ironic, since I'm enjoying bitcoins!
