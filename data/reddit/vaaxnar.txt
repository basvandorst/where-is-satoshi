This is the reason I understood Bitcoin and the reason Im allin with it even if it fails. Its just EV+++++ and I do believe we need it to purge the financial system and the vicioua cycle of economical crisis

Thats fact. You gotta be selfish to think like libertarians honestly. Like dont care at all about other people. And people who only want to be rich are people you should get out of your life
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:14:56
We need Bitcoin, thats fact. But please rethink about the libertarian american-like economical system. We in Europe just think is insane. Your medical system and university debts... I just cant understand why would anyone find that acceptable.

Nice. So you are the type of people who needs to find evil people so you can feel better about yourself. I only think libertarians are selfish and/or ignorant about how the world works.

En mi pais hay gente tan simple que vota a los fascistas porque dicen que les bajarán los impuestos. Las consecuencias ya tal, eso la gente ni lo piensa.
Mi ideologia es sanidad y educacion publicas, ademas de controlar el precio de alquiler de vivienda porke ya se ha ido de madre. Economicamente podria ser mas de centro, entiendo qe a veces hay qe elegir macroeconomia o pueblo. El problema es que ultimamente estoy viendo una falta de ética acojonante en todo el mundo. Personas y politicos.
Estos dias ha muerto gente y han abortado como 6 embarazadas por culpa de listeriosis en un producto carnico. Obviando que el gerente de la empresa muy espabilado no parecia, tardaron en dar el aviso porque les joderia economicamente, y no se pararon a pensar en las vidas qe se ha llevado ese lapso de tiempo.
A estas cosas me refiero, antes que un avance economico se necesita urgentemente un avance ético y moral. En mi país voto existe UP y PSOE. 
PSOE se ha destapado como partido de centro y UP el unico de izquierda.
Yo creo que lo perfecto son ambos (si son capaces de entenderse) y por eso voto UP.
La izquierda de Suramerica nada tiene que ver con la española. Tú de lo que te quejas es de corrupción y de no usar bien los impuestos recaudados. Y eso es por la gente, no la ideologia.
Durante años PSOE y PP aquí han sido la misma mierda corrupta de distinto color.

My bank banned me to do the transaction online (did it before). Went there, they did it for me and there was no apparent reason.
Days adter they told me that they marked coinbase as fraudulent and need my permission to accept the transaction that is now blocked (TELL ME THAT BEFORE FCKING IDIOTS).
25 days have passed and my 100 euros are in the cloud. 5 more days to go there again or bring them to court if they dont give me my 100eur
And another reason to change to bitcoin. I want to manage my own fucking funds. Cant even do a simple transaction without bank fucking it up

Im from Spain, right parties here used Venezuela for years to scare people about the left party in here (which is the most prepared by far, others are just selfish leeches whose only job was in politics. And corrupts, gotta laugh).
So at some point you have to do research. And, like in everything in this life, theres no bad and good guy. America rules the world, America wants you to think Venezuela is a dictatorship and the guy in there is the bad guy. Same with Cuba. 
Im just saying this bc they tried for years to use Venezuela against our left party, the new ETA. If someone insists than something is bad... Dont believe them

Im here because I know this is a once in a generation opportunity and I dont want to miss it.
And because I think the world economy definitely needs some kind of "healing". We are in a vicious circle of growth and recession, with inequality increasing last years... Idk how would Bitcoin mass adoption affect that. But I want to see it

Not mentally inferior. Just people who didnt see into themselves. Almost everyone can be educated in STEM or other reputated studies.
Problem is those who feel superior bc they learnt objective info. The difficult part is the subjectivity of moral and ethics. And its something most people only do when needed. When you go through hard times and you just need to think about these things to get on again and functioning.
This is why I identify as a leftist. Not for the economic side or form of government. In my country I know which is the party we need to progress and thats the left one. Wont say anything about other countries government bc I just know the context in here.
I just think theres too much irrational hate in 1st world countries which is caused by poor mental health. And thats bc we are raised to just be functional. And although I agree thats logical, we reached a point were we need to educate people in psychology, filosophy, history, politics...
I wont dicuss macroeconomy, I know politic economy is finding a balance between state and citizens. And thats something difficult and with no objective answer.
@_date: 2019-09-15 07:13:03
We need bitcoin because is the next step for globalism after internet.
But it will be taxed just like every other currency. A lot of people here are libertarians. I dont agree with that. Governments need to take action in things free market just dont work in a fair way. 
Plus thats a system where rich get richer and poor have it waaaay more difficult to be able to go up in economic status.
Government needs to be there to provide some basic things like Health System and Education. Without that you just cant have a meritocracy (which I agree on even if I stay a little left on the ideology spectrum)

Sois tan simples que no entendeis un carajo. La inteligencia de verdad se encuentra en la gente que tambien ha sabido desarrollar su inteligencia emocional y que sabe que ambas dan conclusiones contradictorias a veces.
En esa contradiccion es donde reside la politica. La politica de altura. Y no los idiotas que basan sus decisiones unicamente en numeros.
Pero no os culpo, yo me di cuenta de todo esto porque estuve enamorado y feliz y se acabó jodiendo precisamente porqe era un inmaduro emocional de la ostia y tuve qe aprender a entrenar esa parte de mí.
Ahora que lo he hecho distingo muy facilmente a la gente de derecha y izquierda. 
Y no voy a generalizar a toda la derecha pq no seria correcto, perp sin duda los de vox sois ineptos emocionalmente. Arrastrais traumas de la ostia y los transformais en odio por baja autoestima. (Lo de presumir de inteligencia es el caso mas tipico de baja autoestima.

I feel like wanting Bitcoin to succeed because of liberal economic thinking is both stupid and not even understanding the point of it all.
Every government will tax them. Most people will use exchanges as banks (if its mass adopted) and people who dont will be prosecuted just like now.
Real problem in politics is populism. 20 years ago muy country political system was corruption. Left or right, just corruption.
Now that things are starting to see the light and politics are starting to get convicted by their crimes, comes populism. In Spain is happening, USA with Trump, England with Boris Johnson... Thats the real threat right now. Real politics resigning and populist scumbags rising in popularity
@_date: 2019-09-06 07:56:16
And I believe Bitcoin is only a global currency, backed by people, that we dont actually need in first world countries but is key for people in other countries that are either in recession or live in countries that are just a shithole.
I support taxing Bitcoin, obviously. I oppose nationalism and support globalism. A true leftist would think like me. This is actual equal opportunity for everyone (not really, but it helps for sure).
Former poker player, Im here because this opportunity is EV++++.
I dont need to lie to myself. I already worked on it and know my true values. And it is not about logic but about ethics. Thats why Im usually mad at society bc of people not even trying to look deep into themselves.

Selfish freedom aka just getting rich yourself. Thats why people are so easily ridden by "lower taxes" and cant look deeper and know what socialism means. 
I support the freedom for everyone to be able to live a decent life. You support the freedom for medium-class people to accumulate money.
And I truly believe people who have actually understood life knows that you only need money to live a decent life. Happiness comes from other things. Thats the core of socialism and why some people will never understand it. Is ethics

Im actually centered in economy, but leftist socially. And thats my priority.
The consequences of Bitcoin mass adoption are really difficult to predict. But now that I think of it, its not about leftism but about the ultimate goal. Giving something to the people. Something we need.
I believe you gotta play the system by its rules. Thats why I like so much what Elon Musk is doing while still being a right-minded way of making things maybe?
I think Internet was a revolution for the people. And now Im starting to see all the bad things it can lead to for weakminded people (theres people in Spain being radicalized by ISIS over internet). Still, is something good for humanity.
Bitcoin is also a thing we need. Now America sets the price of things, and China is about to catch on them. Thats a nationalist centered macroeconomics system.
I want globalism, I believe we need it to stop hating for irrational reasons. And I dont know if Bitcoin is the solution but its certainly the most exciting thing since Internet

You are just dumb. I can easily spot someone rightminded that its intelligent and logical and someone thats just a clown who cant understand opposite ideologies.
For me rightminded and intelligent people are people that forgot about their emotional side and only focused on their logic.
You cant understand leftist ideology if you are one of those guys. Some people will never look into themselves and find what makes them happy. Bc thats scary if you dont find an answer.
Just like playing a videogame can make you have a good time, thats not happiness. Thats just distraction. And I know for sure a lot of people grow up and live their life searching for distraction and not happiness.
Whatever, I actually think whoever criticizes other ideologies for the sake of doing it, is just dumb. Know your enemy and understand their reasoning. Thats when you can call yourself politically intelligent.

This is not about first world. This is about the part of the world that libertarians seem to forget or dont care about.
I believe in globalism. And Bitcoin is the first step to that. Globalism is kind of the opposite of nationalism.
I see a lot of people here who have no clue what having a leftist ideology means. Im only in the social side, economics is something way more complicated. But unfortunately in my country right parties come with shitty ethics (even a fascist party) so theres no way I could even think about voting them even if I identify myself as a left-centered depending on topic, in economics

Yo voto Podemos porqe qiero PSOE-UP gobernando con los mismos votos. De todas maneras yo creo que soy mas Errejonista. Pero sin duda Pablo Iglesias es el politico mas inteligente de los 5 cabezas de partido y el que tiene mas claro sus ideales. Es un hecho que la izquierda tiende a meterse en politica por ideales y en la derecha por el poder. Es 101 de psicologia humaba y teoria politica.
Luego muchos se corrompen, el ser humano es debil. Por esto hay que relevar partidos de cada lado porque cuanro mas acomodados mas corruptos. Y en un tiempo hacer lo mismo.

And btw, I cant understand your point of me having to come back to reply? I hope you are just a teen, serious shit you got in there. Dont assume Im typing out of mind coz it couldnt be far from reality. Search for serenity, you need it

Just read two paragraphs and you said exactly what I told in my other comment.
You are proud of using logic and deduction to reach your conclusions... Thats your problem, and thats the problem of most righty people. Life is waaaaaaaaaaay more than logic and deduction. Politics would be a done game if it was that easy.
You forget about what makes us human. Thats emotion. And I will not explain further bc I find it obvious you wont ubderstand. Bc thats something you cant understand if you dont experience it yourself.
True happiness is in connecting with other people. We just need emotional intelligence to be trained in school. The system wants us only functional as a productive member of a society. They dont care about our happiness. Actually a lot of people dont even care, they are fine with the daily distractions that are just an illusion of happiness.
Thats the next social revolution we need. Psychology. Machines are better than us in every logical sense. But not in psychology. What makes us human is subjectivism (aka emotion), and we are just forgetting about that

Marijuana is not the problem. Your head is the problem.
Im not gonna read this wall of text (paragraphs pls?) but stop with this bullshit of blaming drugs. If you smoke marijuana and it affects negatively your life you got 2 options. 
Stop taking drugs and just try to be a functional member of society.
Or look for whats wrong in your head and solve it.
One is easier, the other is an introspection process that a lot of people never do in their lifes. And thats sad.
Edit: ok just read it. Same thing happened to me, the moment of realization that this is something unique and an opportunity I just cant miss once understood the economy behind it.
Look for real_vijay in Twitter, his articles enlightened me.

I know. This must be a dream come true for programmers and cryptographers.
Actually I can understand it bc Ive been always into statistics and the big data is giving those opportunities.
But in a politic/ethic way or whatever you wanna call it, I think this is all about globalism, just like internet.
And globalism is the opposite of nationalism, which can be left or right so I guess my approach to globalism and equal opportunity comes from lefty ideology but the globalism itself is about a different range of ideology.

No. Thats like cheating for a 10. Smart people would know the max number you can get until its suspicious.

I believe you gotta play the system by its rules. Im here because I believe Bitcoin needs to succeed and it will inevitably do.
Then its when I invest the little money I can because "rooting" for Bitcoin and not investing in it would be dumb

Well then tell me who is doing this? All I know is that everyone is copying Netflix and now you have plenty of stream services to choose from (I stay with Netflix and download the rest).
And all these new services have just come. What you say makes no sense. Its an option in the future, but the present is how it is
@_date: 2019-09-06 06:04:34
You know absolutely nothing about ethics. Nothing. If yoi believe a social ideology is a way of government... Jeez, we live in a society. For real, and thankfully this time Im not alone in this.
One is socially leftist because of ethics.
Could also say that libertarian have 0 ethics and live for themselves and only themselves. Selffish people.
Seriously, this is not about learning politics. If you truly believe leftist equals no ethics youve been brainwashed or you are mentally limited. For real. Im starting to understand a little bit more why society is going downhill pretty fast

Gotta love special snowflakes with them special thingies going in their brains
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:37:49
This. I know a lot of people here is libertarian and actually want Bitcoin because they will be rich.
Im a leftist and Im here because of decentralization and giving the opportunity to everyone to have access to a global currency. This is real power to the people. Equal opportunity

En serio me da mucha pena la gente como tú. Mezcláis la inmadurez emocional que os hace vivir odiando con la estupidez del que le dicen que le bajan los impuestos y le convencen. Estudia un poco de teoría politica

Dont start trading. Its a battle you cant win as a single normal person. Invest in studying if you want to succeed in economic terms.
Bitcoin is all about the idea. A lot of people are here because of money (Im still amazed some people cant understand the leftist side of it) but it actually is the first step to globalism. Well, the first step was internet. This is the second

Are you 60 years old to not be able to cancel a sucription plan? I mean for real, are you into crypto and cant even solve this "problem"?
Mass adoption will never be possible. Because theres people like you
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:13:27
Then you are rightminded. I believe in states interfering with markets when necesarry. And I give you an example. In Spain free market on house renting has led to an average per month in bcn (1200 aprox) higher than the minimum legal monthly salary (less than 1000).
In this particular case I want estate to intervene because having a home is a basic human right and theres lots of empty houses in hands of speculation companies. Thats not correct imo.
Im glad you dont think getting rich is your main objective in here. I just think that a lot of people is here because of this. Selfish objectives. Valid, but selfish.
And I think right/left ideology is exclusively a battle between moral and logic. Its something subjective but its something you gotta work on. I just think the real problem in the world is mental health and ethics. Thats why I vote left even if it will negatively affect my pocket. Thats just my particular case. Been through some shit that made me realize what really matters
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:18:17
I just think a lot of rightminded people are like that just because they havent worked in their inner self. Be blind and dont care about the rest of the people outside your tiny circle 
This is just tribalism, something we got coded in our primitive brain. But we are humans and we can decide how big our tribe is. And thats were nationalism lies on. Im totally against that. Against any kind of nationalism
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:58:42
For real. Thats some serious shit you got stuck in there to act like this. If you are a teen its ok, if you are 20+ it definitely isnt

Why do people use similar colours for graphs? Honestly, im seeing this situation a lot. Is not so difficult to draw one line red or even green (fck daltonics)

Whatever you wanna think. I talked about psicology and philosophy being something I got my nose in for years. And still do.
I know my motives. I only have 50eur in bitcoin, wont be rich anyway. Im here because I saw internet rising and emerging a new era of entertainment and globalization. Now I see its time for Bitcoin to maybe not be mass adopted but sure will make a change in the next years.
An anonymous decentralized competitor that will threaten the stablished economy system of the big nations.
If you are here for the money... You are just not getting the point of it all. But think what you want. Its not about being educated in STEM. Its the same reason I support Elon Musk and Tesla and SpaceX. Its an humanity-changing scale and I love to see how it evolves
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:51:17
No, no matter how hard you think on it I know my standards. Worked on them. Im an industrial engineer and Im curious about new tech and astronomy. Love philosophy, psicology and how does that affect society. Bitcoin is a great experiment about this.
Not everyones ultimate goal is the money. Its actually sad if thats true imo

Who cares about the naming of the currencies? Between BTC and BCH theres one that is 10x+ more valuable than the other. Thats the real bitcoin. Easy
