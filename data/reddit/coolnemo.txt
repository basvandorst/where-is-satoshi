I don't know.. I think he may just be a dick eating idiot.

Well.. I don't ... know... I'm like. ... super offended.. by what you.. said.  You know.....?

Fuck.  Does someone have the link the actual paper rather than this hack piece.  First sentence of the article they spell skeptic as "sceptic".  That almost makes me want to sell my bitcoin.  I'm done.

jeez... right of the bat I can't take this seriously as a bitcoin newb due to the grammatical problems.. i know it's crazy, but that in and of itself makes me worry about bitcoins eventually seeing there true intrinsic value of zero.  Apologies for my grimness.

If you don't believe in a degree of an efficient market with the bitcoin market then by extension you have to believe that they're truly worthless.

Surely you must use some of that "worthless" fiat to survive.  The bitcoin infrastructure just isn't there right now.

None of this applies if Donald Trump is president.  You'll see.  It'll be great.  The best.

well, he ain't wrong

Please don't forget (or for your sake learn this concept now) that markets are priced based on information that is available right now.  The halvening is information available right now.

from the article: "And how about growing social inequality? Through the blockchain, we can go from redistributing wealth to distributing value and opportunity fairly in the first place, from cradle to grave."
wtf, huffington post?  I don't get it.  I'm probably just an intolerant bigot or something. :-)

what grocery store accepts bitcoin?  where do you get your food?  Does your mortgage company or landlord accept bitcoin?

this old balding koot doesn't know shit
he should have advised to take out loans for as much USD as possible, REGARDLESS OF INTEREST RATES, and just willy nilly put that shit in circle and convert to bitcoin.  
Happy 4th of July everyone!
