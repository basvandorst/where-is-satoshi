Yes those offspring will be needed to sell BTC at new ATH because their parents (real fcking HODLERS mutherfckers spartians) died before that :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:29:22
Yes but those people are crying because it is not growing constantly.
I point it clearly
AND You my little fellow looks like a troll/fud guy/wallstreet wolf
want to scary those little sheeps...
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:02:26
Look at the chart.
Rebound, small recovers like this is a normal situation in this long downtrend movement (in fact it is normal for any trend)
For now nothing big happens.
We could see a new way down in some time...
You are panicking and crying and see the end of the world when it goes down 
(Dammit I should sell before it fall down to 0)
and do the same when it goes up ( Dammit I should buy before it is skyrocketing right now)
Take it easy ladies. Loosen your seatbelts if You want to take a long ride with this market
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:45:28
Yes You should. Buy when it is red and there is a blood on the street.
You Can find this advice in any investor guide, read at least one of them. There are problems with guys like You investing and do not know anything about it because It is not good for market stability and for your money.
Be aware of what you are doing. 
Please find some basics guide.
No one will tell You anything for 100% because if someone know what will happen tommorow He will be a billionaire
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:39:08
I didnt say current price is good. I dont like magicans with magick ball. But You say it is 300$ You are a GOD or something like that ?
Thats why I asked about Your formula

Gerard Butler is a real guy !
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:20:41
So what.
It doesn't prove anything.
You cannot say for 100% that trend is changed because of that.
I know You want it to rise but be realistic
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:36:00
No matter..... They HODLLL, They NEVER give up like.....Rocky Balboa
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:55:51
;) corrected
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:16:15
I`m going sleep.
I expect 19k$ on the morning.
Dont fail me guys.
IN GOD WE TRUST
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:11:38
daily discussion are fun :D also You Can find a lot of news from the blokchain industry BUT do not learn investing from people here.
There are a lot of TROLS, FUDers and lambo dreamers panicking all the time. It is not good to learn investing movements from there.
But like I said before You Can read it to find some cool news about techology, goverments moves etc and You Can also buy Your popcorn and watch all those funny people reactions ;).
You should find another place to learn about market investing, taking positions.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:11:37
We are at november ATH.
It tooks 1 month from november to december to reach 19k from this.
So We need to wait 1 month. NO problem.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:11
It is simple each hour more and more people will be crashed and braked and they will sell.... 
Only few HODLErs will survive (300 spartians motherfuckers...)
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:02:55
It doesn't prove anything.
It is too early to say that trend is changed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:42:05
I am buying even If I am wrong and it go down to 5500$ there is straight road to the new ATH from there.
Rich guys want to earn money. 
They exists because of Your fear.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:38:28
For GOD SAKE. Where are those people come from.
They bought at insane fast reached ATH in december and sell in February with so big loss. WTF ???
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:54:17
:D bueheheheheheheh
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:47:56
December rise was insane
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:24
You are insane or You do not know what You are talking about.
How did You calculate it. Pastie Your formula
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:52:55
Going down....
BTC Like to sing britney :
"oops I did it again"
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:11:31
Good point. 
It is still 2017 NOVERMBER ATH.
STOP PANIC FOR GOD SAKE.
IT IS A CORRECTION
Think of this like that:
If You bought 1btc in January last year.
You still have ~10x profit.
It costs 800$ one year ago.
