Only to confuse people.
They think they're better than bitcoin (and so did every altcoin in the history of altcoins), but they call themselves bitcoin to confuse people.
They could have called it anything else and no one would have minded about another altcoin.

It's not lost.  You can rebroadcast with a higher fee or just wait for everything to chill out.
I would suggest using a segwit address from now on though.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:36:30


You have seen nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:04:51
I only did it with the core wallet.  You launch with -walletbroadcast=0, then select the bad transaction and "Abandon" it, then redo the transaction as the funds are back in your wallet.
Paste the raw transaction to blockchain.info and they'll propagate it.
You can also restart the wallet without the argument too.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:29:05
He'd buy BTC though.

Edit the OP with the public address.
When the owner is googling for it they should come across this post.
You can confirm it's then by having them sign something you come up with with the private key it came from.
Unless it came from an exchange.

Try out lightning network so you can be on the forefront of the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:47:42
If you REALLY want you can abandon the transaction and push it through instantly with a higher (30) fee.
I've done it before, it's easy, but annoying.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:21:38


I noticed that as well.  If someone does a GDAX withdraw, check the tx and see if it's batched.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:42:51
combination of segwit, lightning, and getting large exchanges (like CB specifically) to behave.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:21:15


Yes people do...
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:28:56
It has to do with the data size of the transaction, not the amount of BTC.
If you received bitcoin from 100 sources it would be much more expensive to spend than from a wallet where only 1 transaction would be made into it.
This is basically the perfect storm of massive interest before segwit and lightning are fully rolled out, which is why fees are high.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:27:31
Because steam doesn't have lightning, but bitrefill does.
It's an ingenious POC imo.
Hopefully bitpay is testing LN too and prepping.

Until it's included in a block.


Not unless there's a chain split or the block is invalidated for some reason (super-rare).
Right now the mempool is huge due to people moving BTC to exchanges due to the high price, which is in his favor... if he didn't use a high TX fee himself.

That's probably very early bitcoin-qt, which means there's a high likelyhood the BTC are still on that computer.
Search for "wallet.dat"
Edit: the BTC wiki says "~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/", but I'm not sure if that's true for old versions (highly unfamiliar with Mac)
Edit 2: Actually just run that and see what the bitcoin balance is.  You'll need to update to the latest version and download the blockchain to do anything with it though.

No.  And I've been interacting with LTC for a LONG time.

It means less people will hold cash.


I was very careful to not say that I supported any one method.  I simply explained what DOES happen.
@_date: 2014-01-31 11:45:15
inflation is bad for people who have cash or static wages (read middle-class and poor).
Deflation is VERY VERY bad for the entire economy, companies, and rich (capital invested people).
It causes people to stop investing, which causes the market to drop, which feedbacks less investment, and you get a crash.
TL;DR: It's actually sorta complicated.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:14:06
Indeed, but I feel they will only mitigate the issue (which is certainly better than doing nothing).
In any case, local wallet or cold storage is the way to go.  (With backups obv.)

wtf lol
@_date: 2014-01-31 12:46:52
Deflation means everyone hoards money and does not invest (because simply holding it makes the value increase).
Without investment, you don't get companies expanding, this reduces economic output, and investment viability.
Investment viability directly translates to decreased investment return, which further opens the gap between holding cash and investing.
And then it loops.
Your statement is correct, but it doesn't counter mine.

That's because of the college loans causing tuition inflation.  That's a socialist policy that backfired when it intersected with for profit universities.  Needs to be one or the other.  (controlled cost public universities with student loans, or private for-profit with no (or low capped) loans).


It's a question of long term stability.  I don't like the debt, but a LOT of that is discretionary spending like military (including defending europe, which I forgot to mention, while most (not all) of the european countries were slacking financially)

So there is bitcoin.
Then there are these things called altcoins, which basically fork (copy) the bitcoin code, and then change stuff (hashing algorithm, variables,etc.) and the branding and name (litecoin, bitcoin cash, etc.)
So there are THOUSANDS of these.  With the exception of very very few, they're basically all scams.  A few act as interesting testbeds and operate side by side with BTC without anything weird happening (ETH, LTC, etc.)
Now, basically every scam altcoin says it's going to overthrow BTC, and it would be worth a lot, so sometimes people will buy it in hopes that happens (like buying a lottery ticket, 99.9999999999999999% not going anywhere).  Although other people may buy it from you for more or less.
So the newest of these comes along, "Bitcoin" they call it to confuse people.  Everyone else ignores them and calls it "Bitcoin Cash", which pisses them off, but everyone ignores them.
So it forks the BTC code AND BLOCKCHAIN.  So if you have 1BTC, you'll also have 1 BCH.
So the people behind this have a LOT of BTC and money.
So they launch this, and the price crashes because it's worthless.
These guys behind it (which includes some of the BTC miners) buy up a bunch, then launch an attack by having the difficulty in BCH drop low, and shifting miners off BTC to slow BTC down and look like there's a problem.
They then sell BTC into BCH to crash BTC's price (though crash is relative, $7900 to $5500) and pump BCH's price.
They then dump all their BCH at the peak (it was close to $2500-$2800 IIRC) and make off with their money.
A pump and dump if you will.
And everyone who bought BCH got suckered, which is par for the course for altcoins which will "overthrow bitcoin".
A fool and their money are soon parted, especially in crypto.

You can't do that, and it wouldn't help them.

Those are some socialist policies in a capitalist country.
Actual socialism is WILDLY different (See USSR for a classic example and Venezuela for a more modern one).  It also doesn't work.
Having a few socialist polices isn't a problem, having a lot is, and full socialism always ends the same way.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:34:20




That's correct, and also irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:39:25
Are there more detailed instructions on sweeping old addresses?  I have dumped some, but not all of those.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:45:16


Sure buddy.
Some people do that.  Some people held millions on mtgox too.
Most don't.


That's not relevant to the discussion, considering how many ways there are to calculate that number, nor is it even that large.


Yes that is how it works.
Not for people who have the vast majority of their fiat outside of the exchanges like a sane person.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:41:01
It's lower than that on this due to LEO satellites.  I did the calcs a while ago but forgot.  It's feasible for FPS gaming iirc.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:08:55
It's too late for that.
Though I can see adding another PoW as an auto fallback if less than X number of blocks are generated in Y hours.
To prevent someone from switching hashrate elsewhere as an attack....
But it's WAY too late to switch.  Jihan has too much money.
Though if he attacks BTC again, then it might be worth considering.
Or having it already in code to spook him.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:44:59


Sane people don't hold BTC and fiat on exchanges.
BTC can be moved 24/7. fiat can be moved 9-5 weekdays only (with a several day delay).
That is your answer.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:21:56
We're talking about real money, which is SWIFT/ACH/Wire transfer/etc.
Not people using debit/credit (which I note some banks have banned or put ludicrous fees on.)
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:18:36
It's other way around.  It spiked for a very short period of time due to a bunch of stupid shit (primarily Coinbase), and the fact that it was just before segwit rolled out to GA.
It basically immediately returned to normal.
The weird "drops" in colors just before Dec 24th and just before Jan 8th are the spikes.  Everything else is fairly normal on the fees.
And yes, fees are a couple cents like they normally are.
You probably ran into someone shilling for a scamcoin if they were still parroting that line.

Just a note.
Dollar inflation == good for BTC.
Stock market crash == Dollar **deflation**.
You want dollars and not worthless stocks and stuff.
Long term it might be good, but it's not going to be good for anyone (except people holding cash) immediately.

I argue that the price of bitcoins has very little to do with the price.
Everyone knows exactly how many are going to be produced, and the exact dates of production are fairly easy to predict, so the market has already taken that into account.
@_date: 2013-04-28 07:16:33
It's handled slightly differently as far as WHAT it is.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:36:57
That would make bitcoin a foreign currency, rather than a good.
That could cause tax and legal issues.

The heat goes away into the air (and IR).  It goes at a rate that is relative to the area.
The heat sink has more surface area, which means more heat dissipation, which means faster heat dissipation, which means less heat, which means lower temperature.

Not before it reaches the point of no profitability, or someone develops even faster ASICs. 6TH/s per chip or something

The best thing would be reducing the amount they put in for each referral.

Correct, they're valuing it on the short term potential.  The stock HAS no potential after a couple months.
