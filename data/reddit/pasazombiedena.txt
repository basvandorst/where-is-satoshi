I was always curious. If the whole world eventually comes to agree in backing up this "crypto-currency" with some sort of other value rather than electronically. Wouldn't that make it worthless just so as long as people realize it's starting to have no value? How would inflation or any other type of change to normal currency in rotation alter how much crypto-currency is actually worth?

I haven't read the article but in all seriousness, to me it seems like it'll be complicated to get this established worldwide due to not being able to back it up with any physical value that people believe in, things like diamonds, gold, etc..

Dude, you must of read the wrong article. Or decided that the 1 paragraph was worth and adding whatever else. The article states that they are a non-profit company focused on researching and finding cure for aging diseases. Those disease include and aren't restricted to muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's, etc... it also states the price of the bitcoin currency they received and acknowledge the Pineapple Fund and mentioned that it was part of the total 86 million dollars worth of bitcoins donated across the world to other companies as these. So maybe they did donate some of those bitcoins to companies who deal with hunger and sorts. Stop festering my redditors with lies. ;)
