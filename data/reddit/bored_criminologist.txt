It's a band-aid on a wound that requires stitches. There is nothing to stop another pool from rising and screaming, "Look NO FEES!" Such a policy would definitely work in the short-term, but as bitcoin grows this will require a more technical solution as the players become increasingly less interested in the success of bitcoin over the long term. This is not a Ghash problem. It's a bitcoin problem. Eventually the players are going to be more interested in their own success rather than the success of the currency.

Credit freeze.Thaw it when you want to open an account. It's free and it only takes a phone call to enact or thaw. It's really easy. I've had one since an attempted identity theft in 2004. Not an issue since. The rest of your points are valid, but for the average consumer they likely will barely notice any incremental increases that card issuers implement.

You are absolutely right! I can't believe the amount people in this thread screaming for Ghash's head on a platter, and failing to recognize that this is simply a flaw in the protocol. Nearly everyone in this thread apparently expects miners to be interested in the preservation of bitcoin first and themselves second. It's like they haven't spent one day in the real world.

I think a difference here is that he's being deposed because he's seeking the protection of our courts. If he was being deposed as a witness or even just being sued he'd have a better argument. In this case he wants our courts protection without ever having to deal with our courts.

You're right. I'd argue that a metric such as *daily sales* would be the exception. Sales don't abide by business day if you're open on weekends. In this context it makes much more since to specify business day if that's what you mean because otherwise it's somewhat misleading. It inflates your *actual* daily sales. For instance if he left off the $300,000 a month and said we are averaging $15,000 in bitcoin sales a day would anyone logically think that he was referring to business days when his company operates and makes sales 7 days a week? Would those reading this interview be misled? I'd say so. They'd think he's averaging $5000 more in daily sales than he actually is. Now for this interview because he included the monthly figure it's trivial for anyone actually looking into it to figure out he's referring to business day. That doesn't mean the statement isn't a bit misleading though. Also the argument that bitpay doesn't forward payment until a business day isn't great. Credit and debit cards aren't instant for the receiver either, but the sales are still logged on the day they happened. Not when the bank finishes processing payment.

It's not weird for the big warehouse stores. They're low margin businesses that really only generate large amounts of money through membership fees and attracting bulk buyers who create rapid inventory turnover (large dollar profits, but low percentages). This means that every dollar is important. For this reason warehouse stores often negotiate lower processing fees with the card companies. The result of this is that Costco only accepts Amex credit cards, and Sam's club only accepts discover and mastercard. BJ's wholesale took a different approach and allows nonmembers to shop and buy items, but charges them a 5 to 15% surcharge on their bill. This allows them to accept all major credit cards due to the extra revenue from nonmembers making up some of the difference, in theory, from not receiving a preferential processing rate. BJ's approach has been called into question as they've had to do some restructuring in recent years (closing stores, removing pharmacies from all stores, and shedding jobs from their headquarters).

Not really. There's a balance here between intent, implied intent, and the perception of those being victimized. You maybe only intended to use it to B&amp;E, but its presence serves as a threat to the inhabitants. It is that threat of violence that is keeping them in line. So thus you now have a deadly weapon. Even if the initial intent wasn't there, it is manifested in the burglars continued stealing with the crowbar visible as a weapon. It's the same reason we charge someone with armed robbery even if they use a realistic looking BB gun. The person being robbed can't know whether the threat of violence is real or not.

This a really good point that I think gets glossed over. Also, most people don't seem to want to talk about miners. Once mining rewards decrease significantly the transaction fee needs to increase in order to compensate the miners who secure the network. Whether or not that fee will increase to the level of cc fees is an open question, but even if they don't any increase eats into the slim benefits that using bitcoin will offer. I don't know that I've heard a satisfactory explanation for why this won't be case, but I'd love to hear it so I can provide good explanations to naysayers.

The first issue is that sworn statements cannot be questioned. Your lawyer doesn't have firsthand knowledge. Only what you have told him.  A sworn statement and a stand in is fine for simple matters. It gets a bit more problematic with a case like Mark's where there are significant questions over how forthcoming he is being about his company, his liabilities, and how the money was lost. It's arguable that direct dialogue and questioning would be the superior method in getting questions answered.

That's not really surprising. To me it seems like lots of people in this forum don't have much experience in writing academic documents and communicating about them. Most people will communicate differently when talking about their field. There's a precision to the language that you learn when you write about your field. If you read an academic paper and then looked through the author's personal emails you'd see pretty stark differences in writing style. The gulf would be even larger if the person is writing in their second language.  Another example would be reading stuff written by lawyers. Would anyone think they write even close to that manner when they communicate informally?   Not to say that I'm sure that this is our Satoshi. I'm just saying that it's pretty weak evidence to compare professional communication to informal communications about trains and amazon reviews.

Well, if we want to get extra accurate we'd have to use something like this:  "If I walk into an art gallery that charges admission without paying, and make indistinguishable copies of artwork that normally has to be paid for to be viewed and distributed it for free, would that be theft?"

Yeah and usage didn't pick up until the introduction of the GUI which simplified things over command-line.

That's still kind of a weird way to think for a company that operates and makes sales through the weekend. The sales would still be registering on the weekend even if the payment doesn't process until Monday. If I worked for Walmart and said I averaged $500K in gift card sales per week would anyone logically think I was referring to a 5 day week and pushing all weekend sales to the business week? When I worked for target and we had both daily and weekly sales goals were we excluding weekends because they aren't the business week? Of course not. I think it's disingenuous to use this sort of monthly average when your business runs 24/7. It might make sense in some contexts, but not so much in the context of daily and monthly sale averages for a business that doesn't close.

I've always thought they were at risk of being insolvent since their US accounts were frozen.  They lose that money and then possibly sell some stored coins to cover some costs that the USD was meant for hoping that they could make it back quickly with transaction fees, but instead they kept encountering more problems. Couple that with lawsuits and the costs of getting AML compliant and I don't think it's difficult to see insolvency on their horizon.

You need to read the act. It's not about wget. It's about accessing a protected computer. They could've used ctrl-F on a protected computer and still been charged under the act. For goodness sake read about the law.
Edit: I'll even help. Here is the definition of protected computers.
The only computers, in theory, covered by the CFAA are defined as “protected computers”. They are defined under section 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2) to mean a computer:
    exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or any computer, when the conduct constituting the offense affects the computer's use by or for the financial institution or the Government; or
    which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States...

I think you're assuming way more investigative effort than law enforcement would ever expend on a case like this.

I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that bitcoin and its security will continually get easier. The design of bitcoin makes it somewhat difficult to have easy and secure storage. I'm somewhat optimistic, but it needs to be nearly as easy as setting up a bank account for widespread adoption. I don't know if that's really possible while maintaining security.

If I walk into your unlocked house without permission and steal your TV, have I still stolen your TV? Same thing. The crime is illicitly accessing and distributing information that he knew he was not allowed to access and distribute. We can disagree over whether we think that info should have been readily available, but it is not up for debate whether or not he illicitly accessed information and distributed it.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:39:20
Once again it's not about the tools. It's about illicitly accessing the information. If you illicitly accessed it through a command line interface the crime would be the same. Your focus on tools is wrong. It's the illicit access regardless of tools.

So without knowing how an exchange tracks transactions, how do we know that our exchange of choice is safe?  Doesn't this introduce some fairly significant doubt into the use of unregulated exchanges?

That sounds reasonable. Very glad I stopped using MtGox after their US accounts were frozen before. I really feel badly for anyone that still had BTC or USD stuck there.

I get what you're saying, but this isn't really a ton of benefit if you're in the US or other similar countries. For the first point there is an easy way to deal with that problem. Freeze your credit. You call to thaw it when you want the report pulled otherwise it's not accessible unless the thieves have the PIN number that you established specifically for the freeze and of course know that you froze it. For the second point, until most merchants accept bitcoin and also offer a discount for using it the benefit is purely theoretical and not of interest to the average consumer. 
That said I love bitcoin and its potential, but is right when he says there's not a lot of upside to bitcoin for a consumer in the US or similarly situation nations.

Not necessarily. My girlfriend was recently deposed, and they flew her across the country instead of coming to her. It can really occur either way. Not nearly as cut and dry as you're attempting to make it.

Using a tool to steal is a crime independent of the tool. No one is in prison for using wget. They are in prison for stealing data that didn't belong to them. I don't get why you are upvoted right now. What you said is the equivalent of, "I wouldn't go to the US. You can get decades in prison for using a crowbar." Yeah if you use a crowbar to take what isn't yours.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:22:23
You're right it was technically illicitly accessing and distributing information from a protected computer. My point was simply the crime is illicitly accessing that data regardless of the tool. Which is why I used that comparison.

That's true, but if you're interested in a store of wealth then gold is probably safer for the long term. Bitcoin is still too volatile to be a realistic savings instrument.

I don't really think it's being cynical. It's one thing to recognize that most people day to day aren't harming you personally. I think most people would agree with that. It's a rather large leap from that thought to the thinking that most people are honest especially in the context of people stealing from nameless, faceless companies/stores. It's even worse when you factor in that those who are dishonest most frequently give the least signals of dishonesty. So the most dishonest are the hardest to identify. So in the context of double spends I don't think it's cynical to be wary. If the double spend becomes easy enough it will be abused to hell by seemingly honest people. It's just the nature of the beast.
