in electrum it's the default setting for the transaction fee slider and its a blank, unlabeled control. you don't actually see the fee unless you hover over the slider and get the tooltip. 
absolutely i overpaid and it's what i get for not paying close attention but maybe if the fucking software was user friendly and bitcoin wasn't so vulnerable to mempool attacks this wouldn't be a problem.
and the "you're using it wrong" argument is comically reminiscent of steve jobs childish outburst about people getting poor reception on their iphones for "holding it the wrong way". stop blaming users for a systemic problem.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:24:13
Alright. OK, OK. What is better: a medium amount of Bitcoin or all you can eat Bitcoin Cash?
Medium amount of Bitcoin!
Honestly the whole scene could be adapted for the comparison
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:14
Goddamn people on this sub are borderline retarded sometimes. I understand there are changes coming to fix the tx fee problem but IT IS STILL A PROBLEM
Tried to donate $50 to Archive.org last night using Bitcoin, cost me $77 total for confirmation in 5 blocks. Felt really stupid after the fact.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:00:00
Honestly I don't know, but it seems like you would have some warning and should be able to move your coins back if that were the case.
Stuff like this is what worries me about off-chain solutions to the scaling problem, though. Seems to undermine the idea that Bitcoin is not some weird version of PayPal.

Watched it last night with my girl and we thought it was decent. Good history and look into some of the behind the scenes of starting Bitcoin related companies, laws, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:55:04
Told my girl about it when i bought in a month ago and she thought it was interesting. 
Been keeping her updated on the spikes these past few days and talking about the basic principles, community and potential futures of the technology (whether good or bad). She's been researching the tech all on her own now, couldn't be prouder. 
I think i'm gonna set her up a wallet with some BTC so she can start hodling.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:31:05
This is awesome! Congrats!
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:05:15
Yeah I have used it for a year and it has been straight forward.
That being said i'm sure somebody who didn't want to hand over their personal information and use a different form of funding than debit could say the same.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:20:46
Bitcoin is deflationary - there are a fixed number of coins available with the ceiling being at 21 million coins total. The more people buy the more the price goes up since there is a finite amount available.
Exchanging Bitcoin for any other currency makes the price go down.

@_date: 2017-08-01 04:41:14
it wasn't a real audit. by allowing people to withdraw their btc it proves they had the coins all along.

@_date: 2017-11-02 20:51:17
same but i'm kind of glad i have had a few days to cool off. i think instead of buying ath i'm going to wait for the fork and buy it during the inevitable dip. 
the idea that people will cash out and move back to altcoins after the fork seems most likely.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:12:26
seems likely that people will be cashing out gains and spending their extra money elsewhere during the holiday season
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:27:49
Perfectly valid reason for cashing out and I applaud the fact that you used Bitcoin to make your life better - congrats on being debt free!
One way or the other isn't what all of this stuff is about anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:00:03

think i'm going to wait to see what the next 7 days brings. 
don't know if i'll be selling the coming high but i'll definitely be buying the dip afterwards.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:03:01
My mom came up for thanksgiving and asked me about bitcoin and if i could buy some for her
shes the kind of person that thinks you don't need an internet subscription to watch netflix and creates a new facebook account for every device she has.
i told her i'd make her a wallet and hold on to her private keys for her.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:37:08

honestly we're not that far off from that. i always wondered why we couldn't implement some kind of behind the scenes micro-mining/crypto reward system for things like torrents or even websites instead of ad-supported services. 
want a torrent? want to read this article ad-free? your computer participates in a miner pool for x amount of time. not sure how feasible something like this is for smartphones but definitely seems possible for contemporary laptops or desktops.
edit: linked an interesting idea that sounds similar, pretty cool
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:30:28
seems plausible

The chain split was in august, so anything before the split WAS copied.
Copying from the BTC chain after the split doesn't make any sense - it's its own thing now.

lol this is so dumb. he wasn't right in the least. telephones were a massive success and they have immense utility as communication devices.
smartphones are, in part, telephones. the basic principle of making and receiving a voice call is the same, the only difference is the technology and implementation.
even if we were to ignore your ridiculous restriction on what constitutes a telephone since when does 100 years of use equal failure?
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:21:17
there's zero incentive to seed a torrent beyond what is offered by a tracker and/or your own desire to share the content of said torrent.
bitcoin miners still get the tx fees on a mined block. if we get to the point where all bitcoins are mined (many decades from now) you'd have to assumed that Bitcoin has survived that long and has a massive adoption rate. 
i'm sure it won't be an insignificant amount.

There doesn't seem to be an overt danger now that Coinbase has drawn a line in the sand about their stance on the UAHF but it is considered good practice to move your coins out of an exchange to a local wallet where you can control the private keys. 
Controlling the private keys is important since they are literally the keys to the kingdom that is your BTC wallet (where your transactions and balance is stored). If you lose the keys (or they become compromised) then your coins are toast. Keeping your coins at Coinbase means you do not have control over the keys.
I'm still new here so somebody please correct me if i'm wrong!
