No, you can buy GBTC stock. Greyscale, the company behind GBTC, owns Bitcoin and the stock price is related to the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:54:54
I can with Schwab.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:03:51
Good grief, $7500 of USD won't even be worth $7400 in a year. 
My point is that you seem to be only viewing the stability when compared to USD. If you look at USD versus Gold or BTC over time, it looks like the Dollar is tanking.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:35:55
Steady value against what other standard? The only monies that wouldn't move over time would be a basket of Fiat and commodities.

This a misleading title. Should say, "An online class on Blockchain and Bitcoin Fundementals is now 86% off".

Here are statements from the linked video:
1) Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that is not regulated by any government or bank.
2) If money were likened to a record, bitcoin would be the MP3.
3) Bitcoins are stored in third-party websites that provide online “wallets”.
4) The value of a Bitcoin fluctuates like a stock.
5) Bitcoins are sometimes used to buy illegal items, as the purchases cannot easily be traced and can cross international borders without tax. 
6) Bitcoins are minted in a process called “mining”. 
7) Available Bitcoins are hidden in a complicated encrypted computer program. 
8) Hackers use computing power to discover the Bitcoins. 
9) The most easily found Bitcoins have already been discovered and the more are revealed over time to adjust for inflation.

The premium has fallen to 6-12%

Both currencies can coexist and still have value. Happens all over the world.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:00:01
I think you might be right on a bounce back up to 9,000 if we hold at 7,700. However, the others have valid points that BTC has struggled to break 9,000. It does seem like a quick way to make 10-15% though.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:34:02
Who knows, but BTC tends to test and retest the 1000s. Pass through to 12,000 without triple checking the support at 11,000, not a chance. BTC does make quick jumps of $200-300, but seems to retest the waters to let others but in, probably due to profit taking sales after the spike.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:39:48
And in 8 days they'll be giving it away! /s
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:23:55
With this very fast recovery, it seems likely that we could reach 35-50k and then see another significant correction by mid-year.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:55:52
We're only going to knock nicely on the door of $9000 so many times. We're either going to turn away or kick down the fucking door.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:02:13
FOMO can be a powerful force in BTC!
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:11:55
You got me. Now you can go back to whacking off to BTC under $10,500.

My dear Lord. Just admit that you were wrong. You, and many other people, probably put too many commas in your sentences. I use to put too many in as well until my English teacher colleagues let me know.

The difficult question around 25-35k will be to hodl or try to time that correction.

This is just like in high school when the Goldbergger of my class would work up a really good comeback, just to have everyone stare at him and wish he wasn't there. Classic Goldbergger.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:37:51
I agree that we normally test the lowest value a few times, but I think we've jumped up too much to be in that pattern. We're up 30% (approximately 6000 to 7800). I think we'll test some other low value in the 6600-6800 range... just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:06:08
I never believe people who say they bought at (x) or sold at (y). Certainly not people who create accounts just to say so. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:51:18
Keeping the total pool mathematically capped at 21 million prevents the inflation of printing more coins at a future date. 
There's no need to make more Bitcoins. If 1 Satoshi becomes too 'valuable' to be used for say a cup of coffee, we will simply go out to further decimal points. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:05:08
There's even room for grammar Nazis here too ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:32:46
Even in it's current volatile state, shop owners can accept Bitcoin and adjust their prices on the fly to collect a desired total in fiat. And if they really believe in the future of Bitcoin, that shop owner can choose to hold on to the Bitcoin instead of converting to fiat. 
So why not accept Bitcoin if you own a shop. Bitcoin cannot be forged so you know that you aren't getting counterfeit coin. Also in the near future, your revenues will be near instant with lower fees than credit payment systems and no chance of chargebacks. 
Lastly, shops that adopt early will win over customer loyalty from those that support Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:17:46
That was a pretty good entree as well.

120 billion dollars for a global currency is ridiculously low. Canada alone has 70 billion in cash circulating. Canada also makes up 2% of the world GDP. You get the idea. 120 billion USD marketcap is the tip of the iceberg.

And yet they did enter a short position a the low point.

I respect wikileaks and think they do a public service. However, their boycotts don't carry much weight in this case. Coinbase is the onramp to crypto for the average American. The average American also thinks wikileaks is an evil anti-USA terrorist organization. The kind of person that values wikileaks' opinion already knows Coinbase is shite.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:35:19
It's at 80% now, but sat around 60% for most of the last few months. Nonetheless, the premium rises because of interest in the stock and belief that BTC will go higher in the long run. I've held GBTC since October and it's been great to get in and out of. I don't have to pay the taxes on crypto that I would normally be charged if I was trading BTC. My GBTC are in a Roth IRA.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:46:24
True, the purchasing ease has been slow to come, but it is coming. Even as a pure store of value, consider gold's valuation at 8 trillion worldwide. BTC is now only 1/64 th in value to gold, yet is easier and safer to deliver.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:47:52
Nice and slow
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:09:01
Easier and safer to deliver for what purpose?    
Money. It's money dumbass. It's secure, fast, finite money that cannot be copied. If there's fomo, it's because most people see it's value in the future (and they're greedy as shit)

@_date: 2018-04-06 17:52:32
BTC is a currency, and as a currency is used to purchase goods and services. A country can't have say 1 million USD in circulation because the demand requires much more than that to handle the flow of goods and services. My argument is that the global economy's sum goods and services requires a much higher market cap. It has little to do with speculation, unless you're speculating that BTC will become that global currency. Do you think a global currency would have only 120 billion USD marketcap?
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:04:01
If that scenario plays out and the difficulty increases, will the global amount of energy devoted to mining increase? (Assuming these new mining rigs use the same electricity)
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:07:30
Many finance leaders from all around the world say that crypto currencies are here to stay. BTC is the leader of that technology. The current BTC market cap is ridiculously low for the leading crypto. If you believe that the future of crypto is bright, there is no reason to get out of BTC long term.

Might retrace back to 5,000-6,000, but I would would not sit on the sideline waiting for it. Just as likely that it sits here around 7,000 or runs higher.
