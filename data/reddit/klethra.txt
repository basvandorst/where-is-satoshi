Last time BTC was trending down for over a month, it stayed trending down for a year and a half having dropped 75% in value.

I remember it like it was yesterday. I had just opened my Roth IRA and deposited some money in it.i was feeling so responsible for my choice to save for retirement, but I knew that I had to pick an investment that would make me money and be something I supported. Lo and behold, Morningstar showed me that this great company Biogen ($BIIB) was an absolute bull of a buy. At $375, it was a guaranteed winner, so I bought a share. Years later, it still hasn't gone back up to my original buy price, but they did split into two stocks. I almost don't think my limit sell is ever going to trigger.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:33:17
Because it is utter shit right now. That was exactly my point. People buying it believe that it won't be as development continues. It's one of the reasons that I think the hatred people have of BCH is completely unwarranted. At worst it's competition that forces their favorite coin to win its support by improving. At best it's a band-aid that keeps crypto functioning while the development teams steal from each others' successes.

1. I just demonstrated with real and current numbers that there is about a 2% annual difference between the best-paying dividend stock and a fund that tracks the total market.
2. If you read the second half of my post, the difference in risk is only over the short term. That's why anyone planning on holding for the long term should be investing in stocks that will provide growth. It's right there in the terminology.
If you're 100% in dividend stocks, then your low tolerance of risk is delaying your retirement. Everyone should have a number that they're aiming for. Most people pick 25 times their expected, annual expenditure in retirement, so they can follow the 4%SWR. A low return means you hit that number slower than you would if you have some diversification.
If you're less than half way to that number, there's no reason to be gimping yourself by fearing a two-year downswing.

* If you believe BCC is designed to be a better currency than BTC, it would directly harm BCC to become the dominant crypto as the added volatility from speculators makes it harder to adopt
* 8mb blocks wouldn't be enough to fix scaling issues for the crypto that holds over 50% of market share. If everyone we're to migrate to BCC, the same transactions that are taking hours to confirm would still be taking too long.

You could lose everything and probably be fine. Since crypto is such a volatile asset, you would want to balance it out with assets that provide more stable returns. Your emergency fund should be relatively stable (I personally aim to have 6 months of spending plus 30% in a brokerage account that's divided into a three-fund portfolio, but this is atypical. The 30% is in case the market hits a bear run). Your Roth can be more growth-oriented because you won't need it for half a century.

Anyone putting their money into BTC right now is doing so not in the belief that it is a viable currency now, but in the belief that future developments will make it a viable currency.
It needs more price stability. Increased adoption, futures, bank involvement, and fewer people seeing it as quick money will hopefully eventually lead to this.
It needs lower fees. This issue has been beaten to death, but the existence of ETH, LTC, and BCH along with their ready availability to the general public are stopping people from completely counting out crypto right now. If it weren't for altcoins, faith in the future of BTC would be incredibly low.
People can meme about hodling all they want, but all it does is artificially force BTC/USD higher than it would otherwise be and increase their reliance on the support that altcoins with lower transaction costs give in the short term. If you think there's a future for Bitcoin, you're already trying to keep a steadily-increasing value and dollar cost average your way down whether or not day traders tell you that you'll double your money

But that's absolutely bullshit. We already have the need for development of these tools because we're already producing energy at an unsustainable rate. Even if these innovations are developed, it doesn't fix the problem of unsustainability.
When demand for energy increases, oil reserves increase in size because they're calculated based on profitability of extraction and refinement. We don't need to melt the polar ice caps to be more energy-efficient. The demand for sustainability is not economic in nature, so a free market will not address the problem.

I think BTC is either worth the market cap of gold, or it's worth nothing. Since that's over 300,000USD per coin, I'm picking up 10% of my savings rate in BTC while it's still 95% undervalued. 
Once I have a certain percentage of my net worth in BTC, I plan on rebalancing every paycheck. If BTCUSD goes up, I either buy USD or invest more of my paycheck in it. If BTCUSD goes down, I buy more BTC. Autoregulation to protect from emotional decisions is an absolute must for me.

I feel like this is only related to Bitcoin in only the most tangential way. Feels like a bit of a reach
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:57:57
You sure? Because it's probably the most Reddit comment I've ever seen.

I get the point. I just think it's stupid to talk about money until you've been dating for a while. Spend according to the lifestyle that you want to have for the rest of your life, and if your date is interested in sharing that life with you, keep dating.
Once you've been going steady for a while, you should be able to honestly say where you got your money from.

Spend some quality time at learning about these because they're worth knowing about.

Dim, hello. WYD?
I see this low-effort greeting transcends language.

I bankrolled a very reasonably priced psychedelic trip with a friend a while back for ~0.11BTC. My consolation is that I helped the currency grow, and I would have sold way before it got to 10k anyway.

You caught us. Everyone here ignored the lesson on diversifying assets, and you're the only one who knows how to rebalance. I'll be financially ruined when Bitcoin inevitably plummets into worthlessness because that's where I'm holding 100% of my assets. I've actually totally ignored my Roth because I can't invest in Bitcoin on it ������

Or you could take the example of lottery winners and recognize that a massive windfall changes the way people interact with you for the worse.

Hindsight is not an investment strategy.

Hmmmm. That sounds like a scam artist to me.

Didn't Charlie Lee sell all of his Litecoin in December?

CEOs are paid in stock options because it gives them a vested interest in the price of that stock. Nobody thinks twice about it. The winning move was to hold on to his crypto as proof that he is interested in seeing it remain above the status of penny stocks and shitcoins.

Rather, I only remember to buy more when I see Reddit posts.

80% eth and 20% btc. Can't complain really.

I prefer the "only remember to buy more when it goes way up because of Reddit" strategy

It's like having a subreddit about the appreciation of trees and calling it @_date: 2018-04-24 20:39:53
Tomatoes and onions are regulated by the FDA, and you're required to follow their regulatory requirements to sell food. Who exactly regulates which currency is called "Bitcoin?" You can call it fraud all you want, but that doesn't make it true, and if your lawyer is actually real, they'll tell you that you don't have a case unless you can prove that BCH cannot be called "Bitcoin." Good luck.

Ah yes. So much smaller with much less money in play when he sold his holdings in December 2017.

There's also no such thing as Bcash. Why is everyone getting so triggered at Ver playing the exact same game they do every single day?

And is full of arborists. What's your point?

Then why did nobody on this sub take issue with Charlie Lee selling all his Litecoin.

Who holds the patent on the Bitcoin name?

Man, it's a good thing you have a lawyer to do the leg work on this one.
If I sell you "a sandwich" and give you a hot dog, is that fraud too? By all means, waste your money on an unwinnable case if you want to, but I reserve the right to laugh at you for it.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:46:59
You know what I think of when I hear "credibility?" I think of 38-day-old accounts with literally no activity except shitposting against BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:39:53
But a hotdog is a kind of sandwich
