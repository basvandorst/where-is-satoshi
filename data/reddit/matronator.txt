‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

Oh, sorry. Yeah, I think maybe even closer to $50. I thought it wouldn't recover since it was stagnating for some time, but then shit went to the moon.

And I thought it was only good for buying drugs back then :(
All my money is in Bitcoin now, so see you in 5 years..?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:19:50
Too late, money spent.
Since April I have all my finances in BTC, but it's ridiculous compared to what I had in 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:06:58
Now I know. I don't even bother with altcoins anymore, just HODLing what I have.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:57:22
Not anymore, lol. I was 18 and stupid when I made that and wasn't prepared for that kind of money. I spent the last of it at the end of previous year and went completely broke. Start of April I finally got my shit together (at least to some extent) and now I'm holding some few coins again, though nothing nearly close to what I had.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:06:08
Yeah, if not then, I would've probably sold during the next crash. But that would still be about $800 more per 1 coin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:26:01
Don't remember exactly, but it was somewhere between 1200-1500 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:10:52
The difference would be that they didn’t had over 1000 bitcoins back then, I did. Moral of this story (post)? HODL
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:38:48
You'd need to have more than just wheels to qualify as a wagon.
^(EDIT: Sorry, didn’t recognized the South Park reference.)

Well he owes me some coins, if that counts as debt :D
:) Thanks, I hope so too
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:32:37
Nothing now :D . I tried getting a bit into alt trading, but after several hit&amp;misses I realized it was more profitable for me to hodl just BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-21 01:07:27
Haha, exactly this same rule I started using when I got back into crypto in April. But it didn’t even crossed my mind back then (2013-14) to keep at least some - I thought it would die along with SR.
Well at least I learned from it and hope to never make the same mistake again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:32:35
Yeah, back then nobody knew about it and we thought nothing more of it than just a way to buy drugs online. So with the Silk Road bust, when the price started to plummet down we thought that would be the end of bitcoin. 4 years later and it's just beginning to really grow.
("we" as in my friend and I)
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:21:09
That’s how I try to think about it. Because even the half mil I made from it took me down a very dark path and I started to get better only when the money ran out :D so yeah, I’d probably be dead within a year or two if I had that 10 mil.
It’s just that my friend reminded me of it today (he owned 50% of that and takes it much harder than I do) and I thought it to be fascinating how much bitcoin grew since just 4 years ago.

Lol, most grammar nazis I see all have English as their second/third/n^th language.
I'm not native as well, but I always get "mini rage-attacks" when I see native speakers using the wrong form of *your*/*you're* etc. Like "'cmon brah, you had your whole life to learn that shit..."
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:28:59
Well all the money I made, I made in cryptocurrency so I didn't had any fiat money to begin with. Also this way I don't really have to pay taxes :D
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:01:02
BitcoinGold obviously.
^(Just kidding, don't ban me plz)
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:15:48
No joke, my friend with whom I shared it 50/50 is now legit suicidal.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:44:06
I don't think so since it was all cash transactions with few trusted people.
But a sweet dip it was nevertheless.

Or just in a wheelchair.
