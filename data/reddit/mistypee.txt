Sipping on some Talisker Port Ruighe (Scotch beats craft beer) and watching the latest episode of “As the cryptoworld turns”  ����

I'm in the same boat.  Started a transfer 6 hours ago with 0 confirmations so far.  This is, by far, the longest I've ever had to wait for a BTC transaction.
Really wishing I had converted it to ETH before sending now.  Haha!

Head over to r/bitcoinCA
Almost every single thread is about how to sell BTC for CAD.  Haha!

No different than if someone held a gun to your head for cash.  You call the police and report it.  Oh, and you never get your money back because there’s nothing they can do about it {shrug}

Cryptofolio.  Old school, but it works.

Yes.  It will either arrive at the destination address, or it will be refunded back to your sending address.  It'll turn up in one or the other, eventually.

Pffft!  Of course not.  Everyone knows you can only mine using an Atari.
Some people’s children...

Haha!  And here I was thinking it was a slow day for crypto.  There hasn't been much movement or volatility at all in the last few hours.
If you think this is a fast drop, you're in for a world of hurt when it really starts to move! :D

Glitchy.  Very, very glitchy.  You can theoretically sync your wallet across your phone, desktop and chrome extension, but they will all show different balances, no matter what fix you try.  There is also no transaction history available for many of the altcoins.  The integrated Shapeshift is unreliable.  The security PIN is only used for making trades, so anyone can pick up your phone, open Jaxx and see all your balances.
Lastly, they have a known security vulnerability

Coinbase doesn’t allow withdrawals for Canadians.

Apparently r/bitcoin is the new r/theredpill...

The most concerning part of this post to me is the fact that your parents have visibility on your bank account at 16.  Why?????
Open another bank account.  There's no reason for them to be monitoring or accessing your money.

Do you mean Coinbase &gt; Hardware Wallet &gt; Quadriga &gt; Fiat?
If so, that will cost more because of the extra transaction.
The fastest and cheapest route would be Coinbase &gt; Quadriga &gt; Fiat.
If you want to keep the fees down it might make sense to make the transfer in ETH or LTC rather than BTC.

You can't withdraw to CAD$$ from Coinbase.  You need to open an account with an exchange that deals in CAD.  QuadrigaCX and Kraken are two options.  Transfer BTC from Coinbase to Quadriga/Kraken.  Withdraw from Quadriga/Kraken to CAD$$.

It's already above $10k in CAD :D

Never invest/trade/gamble money that you can't afford to lose.  If today's price movement is hurting you this badly, you're doing it wrong.

Ahahahahahahaha!  3 days.  I submitted all the info/docs for Tier 1, 2 and 3 at the same time.  It took a week just to get my Tier 1.   Close to 2 weeks now waiting on my Tier 2.  
Get comfortable, my friend.  It's going to be a while...
