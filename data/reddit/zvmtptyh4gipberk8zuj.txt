How will the wealth distribution look a year from now? Ten years from now?
Is it widening? Are more people being included? Or is it consolidating like the USD?

I don't need you to die, by the way. I understand that we're all going to.

A hardware wallet!
Solar powered, no electrical connections, no wireless interface. Uses QR codes and a camera to talk with phones and laptops, displays and signs transactions.

Following this with my knowledgeable estimates (an ASIC miner):
24 hr * 3600 s/hr *  235 PHash/s
=  2.03 * 10^22 hashes per day
At 1 J/GH (estimate, I get 1.16), 
= 2.03 * 10^13 J/day
ans * (2.778 * 10^-7 kWh/J) = 5,639,340 kWh/day
At $0.08 / kWh, (estimate, minimum of stable countries)
$451,147/day to mine 3,600 bitcoins, a cost of $125/bitcoin.

Of course these two things are coming.

Thanks for working on this! Can you create a simple Gini coefficient over time, and redo this with a rainbow of colors? It's hard to tell one blue from another.
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:48:02
Thank you, you got it.

I agree. I posted this to raise the arguments that new people should hear about economics, currencies and what we are doing here. We're bootstrapping this global currency - it's not the best currency today. We need less inflation, and more adoption.

And noob, thanks for asking!

No, these are not as safe as bitcoin. They have almost no network hashpower behind them, in comparison.
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:52:25
It's a vague statement of preference among currencies, weighted by inflation, adoption, desire as a commodity, and transaction frictions. It'd be better to include a history and future prediction of market cap, transaction volume, and per capita usage.

$32 to $2 was more fun. Would you buy $32 bitcoins today?

I do know how all of Bitcoin works, but I want to give the most simple and short answer possible. I'm rounding out over most of the details.
Bitcoin is like Bittorrent with cryptography that only lets an owner of bitcoins send those bitcoins. 
Similar to Bittorrent, users of Bitcoin share a decentralized ledger that lists accounts and their balances. They do proof of work to modify this ledger, which prevents bad actors from manipulating the order of transactions.
Computing proof of work is rewarding by printing new currency, called bitcoin. This reward is halved every four years, such that by 2140 we have 21 million bitcoins, each divisible into 0.00000001 pieces.

Two related ideas here.
"harder to mine" is the idea of "difficulty", where more computation makes mining less likely to win. Roughly every two weeks, the difficulty is retargeted given the apparent power of computation, aimed so that it will take two weeks until the next retargeting.
"Getting more rare" is the halving of the mining reward. Every block prints new money, a reward for the miner of the block. Roughly every four years, the reward halves. 2009 was 50, 2011 was 25, then 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, all the way down to 0.00000001.

Proof of stake breaks the feedback loop that keeps miners honest: irreversibly destroying energy at a real value cost. Instead, people with "money" are rewarded with "money".

I'm demanding these bitcoins.

This is actually good news.

Hopefully in a decade. We know that the monetary inflation rate will be below 1%, and we can hope that the market capitalization of Bitcoin is the largest currency in the world.

That would require retargeting on a block by block basis, with a moving average of the past to smooth out the randomness of difficulty in solving a block. That's a bit more complex, but I too wish it were that way. Block rewards would change every block, but would be more accurate in sticking to a schedule.

I believe in Bitcoin. It's a bigger idea than the Internet, because it brings quality public-key cryptography to the people. It will shock nations and international trade.
There is great discussion on this post, and I'm happy to see the important points being hit.

I have only played with a trezor. They are secure for cold storage, but not practical as a daily wallet.
I am working on this idea for the best of both worlds:
