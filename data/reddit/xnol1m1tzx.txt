Not many companies are accepting bitcoin, they are using bitpay. That being said, i will find it very interesting to see who in the future DOESN'T decide to accept bitcoin and either gets left behind and dies, or comes ahead in the event of a protocol failure (every outcome is a possibility).
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:41:36
Well I took what he said to mean physically as well. That much in cash would be physically difficult to move and transport where as that amount in BTC could easily be carried on a cellphone or less. (not that I would recommend that....)

I was referring to the "new" one but I did get them confused. Thank you for the clarification though.

If that's true then why does gold still have value? Can't recall the last time I bought my quarter pounder w/ cheese with gold.

B) PEOPLE STILL KEEP BTC IN ONLINE WALLETS???!?!?

Interesting question, do you really think people would be more willing to pay their taxes if they had a say in where it went and their was transparency with the where the money goes? Some part of me feels that people, no matter how it gets used, will act this way simply due to the fact they have to give up their money.

I don't understand the point you are trying to make. You can claim all you want that the sun orbits the earth, and can be against the theory that infact the earth orbits the sun, but you are still wrong.

I doubt they opened your computer and did something to it unless the resorted to something extreme like attaching a USB miner to one of your internal headers, pretty sure that didn't happen. Mining bitcoins requires software, so just look and see if anything unexpected is running, either taxing your GPU or CPU (unlikely) heavily.

No its not, hold onto it and eventually you will have 1/21000000 of all Bitcoin to ever have existed. That's a big deal. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:09:11
Besides the fact that BTC is in its infancy, you are correct.

lol says who?
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:10:32
You should see the transaction appear in your wallet almost instantly, i wouldn't consider it complete for anything important until around 4-6 confirmations. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:13:22
Unless you used an online wallet, that is most likely the case unless by some miracle you have the private keys.

No, they are two completely different operating systems, and that's disregarding the fact that ANY OS can be the victim of an attack.

Forgive my ignorance, why does this matter?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:11:38
I think we both know that claiming the market is only filled with speculators is bullshit. However, even with the percentage of speculation happening, not every speculator is selling at 1k. What we are seeing is simple panic selling causing more panic selling and the price with correct to around the old high.

Exactly, so he's telling you to sell now so you can buy even more when it gets lower. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:35:11
I would highly recommend getting most of that out of there and into cold storage...

My biggest qualm with the adoption of the Satoshi is the fact that we have been pushing so hard to get "Bitcoin" into the public light, and for the general masses to even know what they are that a change in naming convention would be counterintuitive. If a name change is going to happen, it needs to happen now or yesterday. Tomorrow or a few months may be too late and more confusion is not something that would aid the adoption of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:59:29
Well I'm guessing volatility will be a talking point... 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:07:06
That's not the same since most paper wallet generators can run completely client side. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:26:55
The attack described in the link only works if there is a receiver of sorts on the cold-storage computer. If it is clean there is no way for an attack like that to be effective against it. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:34:45
Probably not until the price is more stable as well. You know how much they care about their profit margin. That being said, fuck eBay and their 10% seller fees.

Nothing? People do it all the time, it just not as easily said as done. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:36:50
Charge anywhere near eBay's fees and its not going to happen. Cover overhead and take 2-5% tops. Don't be greedy and you will have much more traffic. That being said, i would be very much interested in a site where i could easily sell my unwanted items for BTC.

I apologize, I skipped right over the Debate tag. That being said, any indepth argument i would make has been mentioned by the two individuals you referenced with regards to the cold storage issue. That being said, I don't quite understand the difference between the divisibility and just reintegration in the very long run.

I see, thank you for the explanation.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:42:16
I believe the correlation you are looking for would be more popular, and in that case you would obviously and logically be correct.

If your going to give these out, i would also take the time to educate them not to accept them from other people as they could have recorded the private keys.
