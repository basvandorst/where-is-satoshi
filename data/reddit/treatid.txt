Just buy the altcoin you want at whatever price it is now (and whatever price the intermediary currency is).
You really don't want to be betting on USD, BTC and altcoin value at the same time. Choose your preferred currency and buy it.
(There is no guarantee that bitcoin will (or won't) dip by a given amount in a given time. Yes you stand a chance of kicking yourself for buying (or not) down the road).

I'd say that bitcoin is looking like an excellent gamble at the moment.
Investing your life savings is a different animal.
If you have spare money that you can afford to lose - I think Bitcoin stands a really good chance of paying off handsomely.
If you have money that you are relying on for retirement - I *think* bitcoin will payoff - but there are no guarantees.
i.e. past performance is not proof of future performance.
(It isn't too late by a wide margin - but you really shouldn't be basing investment decisions on a reddit comment)

You seem to be confusing bitcoin with an exchange that allows trading in bitcoin. They are not the same thing. Thinking that they are is a good indicator that you shouldn't ~~be trusted with money~~ be trading in bitcoins.

You have evidence for this? You can find an exchange that was shutdown for purely trading reasons?
[NYSE closed down]( for Hurricane Sandy, 911 and delayed opening on the 1st anniversary of 911.
It did not close down between 2002 and 2011 despite one or two market blips in that time.
You may be mistaking the closing of certain stocks for a market shutdown. This typically happens when a company declares bankruptcy - but the trading is halted because of the bankruptcy - not because of market movement.
I would be very interested to see your evidence that markets routinely close down based on market movement...

Because a month ago the load wasn't increasing at an exponential rate.
They have been expanding in line with increased load. But the rate at which the load was increasing suddenly shot up in just a matter of days.

Because it isn't their job to make judgements on people's behaviour. It isn't their job to stop panics. This a a financial market. It is your responsibility to understand what that means and the possible consequences.
Money isn't magically appearing out of nowhere. For everyone who makes a $ profit from Bitcoins - there is someone making a $ loss. While the value of bitcoins goes up - the money that you take out has to come from somewhere external to bitcoin.

It isn't Mtgox's job to hold your hand and protect you from the nasty traders. This isn't the tutorial level of a game. If you don't understand the market and the exchange - that is your lookout.
A market closing Trade is a **HUGE** deal. Think "banks not allowing customers to withdraw their money".
Thinking that closing the market is a sensible option shows a staggering amount of ignorance.
[Hmm - if only I could find a way to refine raw ignorance... Seems to be no shortage of supply...]

If you are basing your decision on the last hour of trading - you are not being rational.

Interesting. Excellent reference. Point well made.
Except - those triggers are for the entire market - not a single commodity within that market.
Which puts MtGox is an interesting position, being a largely single commodity market.
An economic collapse - such as those triggers are designed for is quite different to a single market collapse.
Even so - You have demonstrated my remarks to be overly general. There are circumstances under which the market will stop trading - even though those conditions are quite extreme and support my assertion that short of catastrophe - markets don't close just because of a bit of movement.

[A timeline of NYSE shutdowns...](
You may note that Hurricane Sandy interrupted proceedings. 911 (and the 1 year anniversary) interrupted proceedings.
Nothing between 2002 and 2011 - a period which included... Let me think... Can't have been any market collapses in that time - or there would have been a shutdown...
There *are* rules in place to manage automated trading which can lead to runaway cycles. An exchange certainly should be taking measures to protect itself from various forms of attack. These rules are there to keep the exchange running.
Shutting down an exchange is the equivalent of Mutually Assured Destruction - if you have to resort to it - you have already lost.
Large movements in the market are not a reason to shut down an exchange. Or should MtGox have shut down the exchange 3 days earlier because it was rising so fast?
How can you complain about lag and then think the exchange should be shutdown (so you have a day of lag rather than an hour)? Perhaps the exchange should have waited until John Smith woke up so he wouldn't be caught out?

There is an idea that this 'correction' is solely the fault of lag...
Apparently that exponential growth begging for a cash take, the massive number of inexperienced traders ready to panic and some attempts to force matters in a (relatively) shallow market had nothing to do with it...
Shutting down an exchange is the equivalent of a bank preventing depositors from withdrawing money. It is a **VERY BAD THING**.
One does not close down an exchange (unplanned) except for disasters. A market sell off is business as usual - not a disaster.

Lag is an issue. Less of it is definitely better. But it can't be disposed of. If Lag never goes above 5 seconds there will be people frustrated that their milli-second trades aren't being handled instantly.
More important than lag is the order that trades are processed in.
A good trade includes a stop options. That MtGox is limited on this front seems to me to be more of an issue than lag.

Their customers lost their own money. For every dollar that someone has taken out of the market - someone had to put a dollar into the market. There is no magical money fountain here.
