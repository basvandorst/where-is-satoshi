People at work ask me how much I have and I say "obviously not enough because I'm still here".

So he tipped $2K into escrow and then his account got blown away?  
Will he realistically be able to recover this?  
I understand he was vote-whoring but it seems like his intentions were legit.

I was expecting fine print when I read the self post title.

And people are getting into it.  We are mining.  CPU miners can still amass some dogecoin (No investment - you can set your perpetually-running work PC to do it overnight).  People are building or re-tasking GPU rigs as well, just for dogecoin. 
I don't know if it is much of an investment per se.  One would think the ease of supply will guarantee it never reaches BTC pricing.  But even if it hits $.10/DOGE one day, it's a great hedge for some of us with nothing better to do and no resources to set up a "real" mining operation.

Drew: [while doing Stu's taxes] We've got shopping lists, candy wrappers, and what appears to be a moldy bag of fries. 
Stu: I always keep a record of everything I buy. 
Drew: That's nice. But why didn't you just... 
**keep the sales receipts**!?

Bitcoin- it's still over some peoples' heads.

Try mining dogecoin.  Much funny.  Very laugh.

So technically my multi-month CPU mining "operation" that netted $10 worth of Dogecoin was more successful.
I'm a successful venture capitalist!  Somebody tell my wife!

These Exchange collapses have another facet that interests me greatly: the tax implications.
Since the US Feds consider Bitcoin an asset, and capital gains losses are tax deductible (to the point of being allowed to eliminate your tax burden across multiple tax years), will there be a rash of people seeking these deductions this year?  And how would auditors prove you had coins in the exchange that you lost?  I wouldn't be surprised if there were bogus claims here.

The copy on this site is incredible.  "Fuckcoin is based on the same principle and finally you can give a FUCK. Pass a FUCK to friends an family. Do whatever the fuck you want."

No idea if the projections will bear out, but I'm upvoting because of Asuka.

Holy shit. I actually have a fair bit of equity in dogecoin.  
Such awesome.  Very excitement. Wow.

There are several benefits to Postal Money Order. It's basically a check that cannot bounce, it can be cashed in many locations, and can be replaced if lost or stolen.

We do not want people like Bloomberg anywhere near Bitcoin.  This is the guy who thinks he can tell individual New Yorkers how much soda to drink, and thinks he can tell other states what type of gun laws they need.  Anything he touches will surely be turned to statist crap.

Can New York encounter *any* phenomenon, naturally-occurring or otherwise, and *NOT* attempt to regulate it?  
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:19:49
Unfortunately this logic doesn't stop idiot politicians in the US from proposing things like gun control. 
Probably won't stop them with Bitcoin either.
