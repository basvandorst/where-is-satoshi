As someone who had 5 figures USD worth of BTC on bitfinex at the time of the hack and who just got REKT,  I appreciate the steady stream of info and updates that have been posted. The most disappointing thing about this is not being able to capitalize on all the cheap coins available today. In the long term, I don't think this hack will have a huge effect on bitcoin. Just another centralized point of weakness being attacked that down the line won't matter. 
With that said, bitfinex can minimize the effect of this hack by acting swiftly and making whole everyone affected. I would hope that bitfinex doesnt worsen this situation by their actions from here on out.

Good night, sweet prince
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:27:37
I just checked my bitfinex deposit addresses that I sent btc to and only about 20% of my coins appear to have been moved by the hacker. Small sample size but maybe only 20% of bitcoin held by bitfinex was stolen? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:27:10
If thats the address then around $800k stolen? If thats the extent of the hack, I feel much better and I feel confident that bitfinex will be able to make affected users whole again

Thanks for the laugh 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:27:54
My main question is after the haircut is applied, is the remaining 64% of assets able to be redeemed on the same asset? I.e. If I had 100 btc and after the hack/haircut I have 64, am I able to withdraw 64 btc? I want no parts of a USD amount equivalent to 64btc, only actual btc.

Wondering this as well
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:18:41
I think this is the fairest outcome and considering the circumstances, while it sucks to experience any losses, overall I am pleased with the outcome. I can only speak for myself, but the way this is being handled by bitfinex makes me want to remain a customer, provided the security model for bitcoin held by bitfinex is completely overhauled.

Best post I've read in months. A++++ would read again
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:11:58
Ive explained it to a handful of my close friends and all of them are skeptical at best. I'm not the best orator to begin with, and that combined with the ideas that it is only for buying illegal things and a ponzi scheme are already ingrained in their minds. One of my friends was mildly interested, he's a pretty bright guy and his first thought was that it was unstable due to the vulnerability from a quantum attack. I wasn't able to refute that directly and the converasation tapered off. 
Lately I've been asking random people if they've ever heard of bitcoin and what are their thoughts. Out of the 20+ people I've asked, only 1 had heard and he just mentioned silk road. We are a LONG way away from mainstream adoption.
Its sort of frustrating. I started buying bitcoin exactly one year ago today and like most of us here, it has become one of my favorite things and really is a big part of me. Not being able to share it with people is tough. My wife kinda gets it, and has her own personal wallet (and we also have a joint wallet) Aside from her though, its a tough sell and she only came around after me talking about it for months on months, watching youtube vids with me etc.

I just got into Bitcoin in the beginning of December and my holdngs are at 2.89 worth right now. Just placed another order for .25 more. Call it blind optimism if you will, but I'm not going to give up on what this technology can do for all by panic selling. I do worry that the masses will be too blind to see the potential of Bitcoin and it never makes the massive societal impact that we all know it can. Even if that is the case and it goes to 0, I can die knowing I did my part, and that provides enough peace of mind for me to weather these tough times. Also, not checking my balance helps :)
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:28:12
To be honest I never probably would have gotten involved with Bitcoin had the price not crashed. I just started buying in December, buying $20 here and there and I'm now hodling almost 5 coins now. For alot of us middle and lower/middle class folks, it just wasn't feasible to get in with prices near $1000. I can only hope that the price continues to be stable in this $200 range or lower for the next few months so that I can continue to slowly accumulate more
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:13:38
Oh no, 2.89 is my total holdings in Bitcoin :)

Did the same thing though I did it around February. My only regret is that I didn't take the maximum loan allowed by my plan. Now I'm trying to figure out a way to get more of my 401k funds into bitcoin
@_date: 2016-03-30 14:56:29
I actually feel like this is what is going to happen as well. I think there will be a huge selloff dropping us down to around the $300-$320  range. Although from there I think we bounce and price continues to rise. Just feel like there is too much hype around the halvening and when it doesn't provide the rocket fuel that people are expecting, there will be selloff overreaction.
From a technical standpoint, price still hasn't retested the $310-$320 area that it finally broke out from late last year. I feel like this has to happen first before we go for all-time highs in price that everybody thinks is coming.
Obviously I hope I'm wrong, but its a realistic scenario that I am planning for.

Like Novogratz said, the herd is coming. I have a smiliar experience. Gotten about 10 people involved buying BTC in just the last week. Two of these are good friends that I told about BTC almost three years ago that I gave long 1 hour+ talks begging them to get in but they didn't see the utility proposition at that time. Better late than never I suppose.
We are entering the parabolic phase of S-Curve adoption IMO.

Never used gyft before, how do you buy mutliple gift cards at once? It seems to only let me buy from one retailer at a time?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:19:07
Both of them see the utility. One more than the other, but for both of them I think when I first proposed bitcoin, the idea of it being a scam and fiat being the end-all-be-all was to ingrained in their heads to really give it an honest look. I was just looked at as crazy.
Nowadays, the idea of cryptocurrency "becoming money" in the broader sense isn't as crazy. Outlets like CNBC are posting videos seemingly every few days talking about bitcoin in a neutral-positive light. Reputable people have made substantitated claims of bitcoin price reaching levels of $10,000+ in the not too distant future. We just had an article posted the other day where Deustch bank says fiat may be coming to an end. 
Things are changing rapidly, and people who didn't initially allow themselves to see the value proposition are becoming more open to the idea of bitcoin. We have to always remember that the vast majority in this sub whether we want to admit it or not are out of the box thinkers. We wouldn't be here if we weren't. It takes others more time.  Of course the price rise helps with the excitement from new users, and of course that can lead to some weak hands getting into the market, but I think it is more than just the $$
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:23
95% of my portfolio is in BTC. Only small amounts in shitcoins that I feel might provide passive income down the line. I think we are going to look back on this as the year of the shitcoin bubble, not the bitcoin bubble

Hate to be that guy, but if you bought them without telling her and have kept them a secret for this long you married the wrong woman.

Gemini seems to have a much lower fee at .25% compared to Coinbase at 1%. Also, seems like they have a better price. on Gemini 1 btc is $419.82  vs $424.86 at Coinbase with fees included on both. Not sure if this is a unique situation or if this is the norm. I've been exclusively a Coinbase guy up to this point but I'm thinking of switching

Seems like a solid model. Bitcoin allows companies to charge users on a per use basis. They could sell movies for .$05 a piece. I'm sure a ton of people would be interested in that. Hell I might actually pay for a HQ movie every now and then if that was an option

Hold me close
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:12:38
I beg to differ with you, in terms of being profitable. If you would have placed sell orders at $420, you would have made quite a bit of profit today depending on where you entered long. Anybody with a grasp of TA could see the $420 area would be a key level and you could have placed sell orders around that resistance zone to capitalize on it. Just the same way you would have placed buy orders around the $310-$320 area  once we broke out of the triple bottom.
I dont trade bitcoin, I only buy and hodl and sell when I purchase goods using bitcoin (which I replenish quickly therafter) but the charts especially on higher timeframes gave clues as to what was happening. I posted 2+weeks ago that once we broke past the $310 levels it would be a relatively quick move to $420. This is the type of stuff that traders look at to make money
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:57:05
No offense, but thats kinda crazy talk and I think you're missing my point. In my view, TA tells me not what will happen at the critical levels, but simply that these are the critical levels where we can expect something to happen. So for instance, if I was a bitcoin trader and long from $310 (or some level lower), I wouldve considering exiting a portion of my position at $420 because TA tells me that price has a good chance to stall or reverse there due to it being a resistance zone. If I wasn't in a position, TA tells me I can take a short at $420 and have a good risk/reward in my trade, or take a long position if were able to chew through the sell orders near that level and continue pushing past. My initial post was that I thought price had a good chance to reach $420 today because of the momentum and that it was the next critical level and it was close. I stated that if it broke $420 (which it didn't) then all bets were off because given the momentum and the fact that there isn't another resistance zone very close, the upmove could have easily continued. S/R levels are just levels where there is heavy buying/selling pressure. Once we know we are at a S/R level, you still have to watch the price closely to see how it reacts IMO
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:02:04
In terms of technical analysis, a break of a level means that price went past the level and typically closed above (or below) that level on a higher timeframe (one hour chart would probably be the absolute lowest timeframe we reasonably consider for an asset like bitcoin, but really a 4hr, daily, weekly or chart would be more suitable) Today the price went past $420 (depending on the exchange) for a few minutes maybe (5 at the most?) and then promptly dropped down decisively under $400. That sharp move away from the $420 level means the price didn't "break" through, it was actually repelled by the $420 level. There were a ton of sellers who though it would be a good idea to sell at $420, thus the reason it acted as a resistance level today.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:34:09
Thats the next resistance level. Id be surprised if we dont "touch" it today with all this momentum. Now if we break $420, all bets are off
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:43:50
Thank you based bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:46:02
Yup, it looks like just a touch of $420, we never broke through. Not sure why all the downvotes to my original comment, its just basic TA, which to this point seems to be spot on
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:01:23
I know we hate technical analysis, but there is a nice triple bottom formation on the weekly charts around the $220 area that we seem to be rising from. This breakout could be the beginnings of a very long term upward climb
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:07:49
I have real tears in my eyes. This is gold lol
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:28:31
I think if we break $310, $420 ironically enough is the next major resistance area and would probably be tested not long after the break of $310
