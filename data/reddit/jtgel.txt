I tried spamming them with invalid logins, then they started forwarding my IP to the legit site. The one I got hit with, they give you a 24-48 hour blocked for security reasons message, and if you use a new IP,  it's game on for them

I was confused when I first signed up too. I thought they wanted my bank PIN (that would have been a big ol' nope!)...luckily they don't. In your Coinbase profile, you made a password to be able to do transactions...this is the PIN they are referring to. (to prevent theft from phishing attacks I think)
edit: sorry, that was for Quadrigacx (Called a transaction PIN in your profile)

I almost got hit on Nov 19. 
Part of the problem is the "Let's encrypt" ssl certificate makes it appear more legitimate than it is. It's basically a self-signed ssl certificate, with no trusted authority.
The Secure lock needs to be green...not grey. 
It seems they are using ordertld.com as a registrar...it's very fishy, the website doesn't even work. the "abuse" team I contacted appears illegitimate.  A google search links it to a whole honeypot of websites that phish.
I've reported it just about anywhere I could, including Coinbase.

Sure is making me paranoid about security...this is the 2nd time I've been phished this month...it would never had happened if gdax didn't have such a horrible interface for uploading ID documents that it forced me to use a mobile phone instead of a computer...I clicked a google gdax paid ad link...last time I do that.

Coinbase was quickest to approve me...I bought with credit card...they limit to $250 per week for the first while though...I signed up to an exchange located in my country for the lower fees, and ease of transferring money for the rest of my purchases. I bought a hardware wallet, and plan on getting all my bitcoin off the exchanges as soon as the wallet arrives. I'm a little worried that the exchanges may be forced by regulators to freeze all funds they hold in the event of potential economic collapse.

Damn, that hurts...I wonder what the quickest way is to get this site taken down. This needs to move up so more people can be aware.
