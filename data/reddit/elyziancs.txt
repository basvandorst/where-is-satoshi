A year ago i made a post about taking a loan to invest in bitcoin, people told me no.
Today I would have retired.
Always listen to yourself, dont believe anyone else.
 This is a 0 or 100 investment for sure, but the risk / reward potential is so huge that you should invest more than you can lose.
Its a bigger risk holding fiat than btc.

Isnt bitcoin supposed to be a store of value, gold 2.0?
so what if bitcoin cash exists, in the long term both will probably be worth something.
So cant the price off bitcoin cash be based of bitcoins value in the long term?
like usd was backed by gold long time ago.

I believe the rally is starting now c ya @ 6.8k, will be more bear markets though, never to &lt; 3k i dont htink but around 3.5k-4k for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:00:52
Its no longer a question if, but more of a question when the economy will collapse.
What would happen to Bitcoin if this were to happen in the near future?
Would Bitcoin be considered a safe haven or crash with the rest?
If safe haven my bet is $1million per bitcoin within 4 years
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:27:00
Its all rigged btcoin will reach  $1million but under controll

@_date: 2017-09-04 12:39:43
Meh, Bitcoin has gone through worse.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:12:09
Its completly different times my friend, its like a new world...
pushing into digital world crypto being one of them we will within a couple of years after the economic collapse become the one world currency.
Road there might be shaky but its all preplaned so hodl and buy urself a nice house in 4 years.
Netflix bitcoin documentary is the most undervalued news, you need to know how this world operate to understand this.
