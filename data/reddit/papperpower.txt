It is one of the most exciting Bitcoin Expos I ever saw! Thanks!
I especially liked how the topic "Bitcoin and regulation" is told.

I'm jealous those people who have the opportunity to attend such conferences. This is an invaluable experience!
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:26:29
This is a huge breakthrough for Bitcoins!

Where can I see a list of stores which are located on this street?
PS I'm very happy! This is great news!

I am glad that the payment for goods and services using Bitcoin begin to develop around the world! When I'll be in Paris, I visit Chez Sof. This trendy bar can be a sign of France, as the Eiffel Tower, but only for the owners of BTC.

It seems to me that the best way for you  - ATM
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:24:19
It looks amazing! Have you developed design by yourself? 
Ps thank you to developing a  Bitcoins system by accepting it as a means of payment.

The full  interview with the google guys is very interesting. I thinks they said about interesting things

IMO, it's not good news for gamers.
 Now you can loose not only your cash :D

Is the price of goods in the Bitcoin less than price of goods in usual currency?
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:24:03
I'll added Greece to this list. 
I don't agree with the existence Ukraine in this list. 
Now they must settle the political situation in the country at first. And introduction of a new and incomprehensible to the masses currency can generate new excitement.

It is interesting approach. I never thought about this issue with this position. Banks are ruining our society! We need to use independent currency as Bitcoin to protect yourselves.

Do you know what pizzerias accepts Bitcoins as payment today?
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:25:53
Are there pictured the blockchain?
PS graphics is pretty damn good!
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:39:17
IMO, this is not such a BIG news. In this case, the government has got a typical loan from householders and not "stolen money"
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:22:04
Cool! Your store is awesome. I was ordering "Darth Vader Star Wars Pop Bobble Head" as gift to my nephew. He was delighted! I'm glad that now I can use Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:54:36
I like it! This system  provides an additional protection. 
I like the idea with SMS (especially that they are free).
Paper OTP Login is new and more difficult, I meet this mode first time in my life. I don't understand how can i get the A0 to this mode? From SMS?

It's awesome! You should provide the parameters for the experiment for other universities.
MIT has always been a leader, but now it has proved its openness to innovation and the development of their students.
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:48:58
I hope so! 
I'd be happy to pay for the app with Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:18:12
I decided to diversify storage of my Bitcoins in order to protect them. So I use a Dark Wallet and I like it cos it's easily accessible and understandable.

As any other business out there, they have only profits at heart. And looking from business perspective, they are right.

It is great that this resource has become more interactive. Hope, that cryptocurrency fans will like it. I have no cryptocurrency of mine but I really enjoyed the new look.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:43:51
I wonder how many % of Bitcoin these 1586 readers have?
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:23:59
