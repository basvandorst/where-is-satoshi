Probably because anarchy would be expected to start around that time due to massive job losses, starvation, etc, etc.

I also support it. A dumping of 200k btcs will just kill the price of btcs immediately as the market currently can't absorb such a large supply.

Yes, but how can we mine without electricity, see?

I'm liking this. We've now established that it's potentially very difficult to lose power all at once, and now we've established the possibility of radio transaction broadcast in the case of total loss of connectivity. Looks like we're addressing those flaws he mentioned. Definitely liking this :)

I think what he's saying is that if the miners aren't doing their "public ledger" ing then no transactions can occur hence bitcoin becomes valueless. This makes sense.

Hmm.. makes sense.. I guess total loss of power is pretty much impossible, you're right. What about internet, is there a possible scenario where we could lose total connectivity?

Ok, thank you! Great answers!
He wasn't arguing for the sake of arguing. As I said he has a brilliant mind, and I just picked his brain by asking him what he thought of bitcoin. He was humble about his knowledge of bitcoin which he said was minimal but managed to come up with those two very valid points.

Sorry for being slow, it's late here in Oz :) but how can bitcoins take advantage of no internet, no electricity and no network (as mentioned by canad1andev3loper above)?

OK, I'm getting a general drift here. Basically what everybody is saying is that the only 2 things that make bitcoin inferior to gold are not worth talking about, because when those things come into play, we're already finished as a civilisation anyways, right? And I do agree, come that time, water, food, guns are probably more useful.

Thanks Andreas for all the hard work you've done for our community.

Ah wow! That's another flaw in bitcoin I didn't think of! I originally thought as long as I could have it in my USB my bitcoin is safe! 
Then, how come you are still saying that bitcoin still has a much higher upside after we just exposed 3 flaws now? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:35:49
Yes! I thought that too! When things get that bad, there's probably not much of civilisation left and owning physical gold is probably creating more of a danger to your well being! :)
