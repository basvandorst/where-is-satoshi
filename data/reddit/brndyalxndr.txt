How come the spread has been reduced to pretty much 0 in the last few days?

Without going into too much detail, i am running a similar operation but my arbitrage window closed today as prices on both of my exchanges are basically the same. Would you expect this window to open up again soon?

Sounds good, message me when you're free, we're still figuring out our model so there's no rush. Take care of your personal stuff and we can talk, best of luck!

You and me both. One of the saddest days of my life was when I had to sell my 98' Camry. Best car I ever had.
