It's just a method to smooth out losses/gains - you just buy $50 a month (or what ever amount you can on a regular basis). This cost averages your BTC holdings vs. USD (since you'll buy high and low) - but in a market like this it could just lead to constantly buying a lower and lower dip.

Please don't..... he's become a tea party darling and wants theocracy and more benefits for the rich instead of rebuilding our infrastructure and helping the poor that are actually suffering.....

I get it just fine - all transactions are still recorded by the buyer and the seller - these get sent to the tax man buy the seller (and sometimes the buyer, if it's a big ticket item, for the tax deduction). 
This is the same as doing cash business - those people still pay their taxes.... and if they cheat and get caught they get in trouble. Same would apply in a BTC based economy.

Have you read his platform on social issues? 
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:58:32
Who's been shot in the head in this country for not paying taxes?
Yes, you can go to jail if you don't pay your taxes - because they are your fucking taxes....
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:27:54
this x 1000 - Bernie is what we need - Rand is more of the same with a slight libertarian leaning..... wanting less regulation of the already out of control banks and big oil..... that's not what we need at all.
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:36:01
It's called taxes - it's not theft. You are paying for services - fire, police, roads, healthcare, education - ya know - the things we need to survive as a society.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:23:52
I can understand that viewpoint.... But some of his social views are still pretty ass-backwards....
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:57:01
Yes - what's wrong with that? He's a democratic socialist - ya know - like the best countries in the world for healthcare, lifespan, crime-rates, education, etc......
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:25:49
Exactly.... don't act like he's the libertarian champion we all want and need - he's actually just a right winger that's trying to keep big business as happy as the rest of the GOP crowd (and Hillary)....

I will process all of your bitcoin for bitcoin purchases for the low-low fee of 1% of your transaction!
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:24:32


First off - all bitcoin transactions are traceable through the blockchain....
Second off - there are many untraceable  transactions that happen today - and they are taxed based on people reporting them correctly. if you get caught doing it wrong (via an audit) - you would owe back taxes for what you didn't report. This is the same as if you were trading cash for foreign money too. 


Not sure you've really read up on Bernie Sanders..... 
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:51:13
He favors a national ban on abortion (except for a few cases where the life of the mother is at risk).
He is against gay marriage - saying it's not biblical.....


Guess fuck that whole first amendment....
He wants to tear down anti-discrimination laws:


Guess he also isn't aware of how hard it was for a black person to get into a restaurant before the civil rights movement....
He wants to give voting rights to felons (I actually agree with him here).
He wants all gun control laws struck down - guess he hasn't seen the murder rates in the US....
He thinks vaccines should be completely voluntary and refuses to spread important, verified scientific and medical data on the subject:


He also couldn't give one actual case where that happened..... but fuck logic!
He wanted to have travel bans to Africa during the Ebola outbreak - a move that would have cost many more lives.
He just wants to build a bigger fence here in Texas to keep the Mexicans out instead of resolving bigger issues at hand....
He's opposed to medical marijuana laws (on a plus not he also says it's a states' rights issue - I agree with the second half of this) - although he's also for much greater leniency for drug offenders (something you'll hear few on the right say).
He opposes legislation limiting the amount of money individuals, corporations, and organizations can give to candidates. He thinks the way that campaign finance is going now is just fine and fucking dandy.

What does being a democratic socialist have to do with use of a cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:26:50
Bernie Sanders 2016 - an honest politician that supports the middle and lower class while also wanting to bring us into the 21st century regarding healthcare/R&amp;D/etc. 
But, then again, as you mentioned: 


It's too bad that we have allowed dishonesty to be OK as long as you look good on camera and cater to the right companies. We're so fucked.

To go along with this questions - I have been lending coins on Bitfinex for a while to gain some interest waiting on the eventual rise (to the moon) of BTC's value. I use 2FA with my account as well as a complex password. How safe do you guys think I am?

This may be an OK place to ask this - and perhaps is a great person to have answer this...
I've been curious, how do offline wallet generation tools guarantee that you are creating unique wallet IDs? How would your copy know that nobody else had generated the same wallet ID? I understand there are a shit-ton of available IDs (like 10^48 or something), but is it just random chance that prevents collisions? 
I understand that the chances are astronomically small that there would be a collision, but is there any active collision prevention on the offline generators that seeks to prevent this problem ever occurring? 
Also, I love what you did with this CD, and will be buying one in the near future! Thanks for your work on this.

First - I was just being silly....
Second, I do, but it's hard to have more than my $60 stolen if someone takes my 3 20s. It's a bit more dangerous if someone were to take your wallet address and private key without your knowledge, even on a small paper wallet - they could take any future money you put on that wallet if they were sneaky about it and didn't empty it immediately (you could, potentially, put more funds than the 100 mBTC on there at some point in the future, if they stole several private keys and only emptied the wallets when the value went above some amount)..... this is all stupid and hypothetical, I'm only going this far because I've slept about 6 hours in the last 3.5 days..... 
TO THE MOON, or something. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:16:02

Was doing some door-to-door politicking yesterday trying to prevent some awful bills from passing here in Texas. One of my neighbors (only a few doors down) has an older kid with autism, and a younger kid they refuse to vaccinate.
They berated me for about 20 minutes (I wasn't even there talking about vaccinations at all - they brought it up then went into attack mode). They threw out everything - "There's mercury in them", "You don't know who did those studies", "my doctor said that vaccines cause autism - and you have no idea how many doctors think that"
My kid's not going near their house, that's for sure.

Not necessarily. We rely on something called Herd Immunity - immunizations only work for a majority of people. For other people, they decrease but don't eliminate the possibility of getting the disease. Others that are too young or immuno-compromised can't get the vaccines either. The rest of us need to be immunized to protect all of us.

But you can actually read it if you were so inclined. You can learn everything about bitcoin without faith if you want. The same can not be said for any religion I've been made aware of.

Which god? Why do you believe in said god? Why do you think he is against lying and stealing? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:21:22
If someone could learn about these unknown unknowns by experimentation - then they are testable, repeatable, falsifiable.
In faith-based world-views this is not the case. By current definitions a soul is un-testable. Same for ideas like Heaven/Hell/Gods/Demons/Angels/etc.
There is still a huge difference in a faith-based idea (religion being the most prominent) and a difficult to understand or not-yet-fully-understood concept (like bitcoin).
