Hi, very interesting paper. For operational, flexible, "general purpose" quantum computers we are likely to have to wait for one or two decades, but how about a custom board for quantum mining? Could something like that be developed in, say, ten years, at a price affordable to consumers?

"I like children but not sex"
This position is sensible (just like "I like the blockchain technology, but I don't believe in bitcoin as a currency"), but the fact is that it's our built-in drive for sex that ensures having enough children for a next generation. Similarly, the blockchain technology is awesome but it would never have taken off without the financial reward.

Good question! I guess you are thinking that if the economy is a zero-sum game, you don't get rich without making others poor.
But in this case you don't take a lot of money from one person. You take a bit of money from many persons, those who are invested in things that go down if bitcoin goes up.

A few hours ago I posted similar thoughts to Bitcointalk. See also the discussion so far, interesting:
Who will maintain the post-mining Bitcoin network and why?
It is often said that, once all bitcoins have been mined, the miners who maintain the Bitcoin network will be compensated with transaction fees. But that will kill one of the main competitive advantages of Bitcoin, which is very low transaction fees.
OK the day when all bitcoins have been mined won't come for decades. But in a certain sense we are already in the post-mining phase, because mining is no longer profitable enough for most individual users. So I think we are beginning to have this problem now - no miners = no Bitcoin, mining not profitable = no miners.
Of course a new altcoin can be created to make mining (of the new altcoin) profitable again and thus provide incentives to new miners, but the new miners would be maintaining the new blockchain, not the Bitcoin blockchain.
Any new thoughts and perspectives on these related issue?

Some people in this thread express disappointment and think that Musk, by focusing on Silk Road and similar episodes of illegal use of Bitcoin, shows that he doesn't get Bitcoin and its revolutionary aspects. It's possible that Must hasn't paid too much attention to Bitcoin so far - he is, after all, a very busy leader who wants to save the planet, take us to Mars, and then colonize the planets and live in outer space.
But I think Musk's observation is worth listening to. Some things shouldn't be illegal. Laws are a product of their times, and evolve with time. All serious politicians and lawmakers know, though they seldom mention it in public, that some degree of creative experimentation outside of the laws, and even against the laws, must be tolerated to permit the evolution of the laws themselves and society as a whole. In other words, society needs bridges between legal and illegal.

A sidechain can be implemented as en entirely separate blockchain without changes in Bitcoin Core, and there is a test sidechain developed by Blockstream on Github.
But if the sidechain is to carry bitcoin as a currency and implement the possibility to transfer bitcoin from the main blockchain, suitable hooks must be implemented in Bitcoin Core. I do expect considerable resistance to that.
But sidechains can add so much value to Bitcoin that the change is likely to be implemented. If not, Bitcoin might soon become obsolete and give way to an equivalent network that implements extensibility via sidechains.
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:00:44
I guess Bitcoin will play both ways.
In view of current trends, it seems likely that the Bitcoin network will be de-facto owned by banks and governments. Circle is a good example - a service that makes Bitcoin easy and safe to use, but it's owned by a company that must comply with all applicable regulations, including reporting its customers to the authorities.
My point is that we should protect and foster underground pockets of resistance and technical means for private, untraceable transactions. Of course such means will be beyond reach of most users, but it's important that they exist.
One possibility is that, if (for example) somebody deploys a zerocash-like sidechain interoperable with Bitcoin, the authorities will just attack the weakest point and make Bitcoin exchanges illegal. But that isn't very effective if users buy and sell with bitcoin instead of converting to fiat.
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:11:33
Thanks for replying. In the (still very fuzzy) scheme that I have in mind there is no ownership of real shares, but ownership of micro-shares (meta-ownership of fractions of shares). It works more or less like this (I am calling the system bitdaq, just to call it something):
* I but 1/100 FB by sending $0.93 to bitdaq.
* When there are enough buyers bitdaq buys one real FB share.
* I receive ownership of 1/100 FB on bitdaq (minus fee). That doesn't imply ownership of FB. It's an agreement between me and bitdaq.
* I can sell my 1/100 FB to other users and buy other micro-shares from them.
* If I want to cash out I place an external sell order with bitdaq.
* When there are enough sellers bitdaq sells one real FB share and pays me 1/100 of current price minus fee.
Of course the problem is trust - what happens if the bitdaq operators take the money and run.

This is really great news, especially if the card will be available internationally. Looks like the best way to spend BTC in the meatspace "real world" and a huge boost for the BTC economy if it takes off.
I must say that I find difficult to suspend disbelief. I think the paperwork  behind a BTC debit card is huge, especially if it is backed by major banks and credit cards.
A debit card is good enough (asking for a credit card would be a little too much, wouldn't it). What I want is a quick way to pay for a beer in BTC. Once we have that, BTC will grow exponentially.

Video and quotes from that talk here:

Values goes down as soon as somebody converts bitcoin to cash. Value goes up as soon as somebody converts cash to bitcoin. Now more and more consumers buy things with bitcoin from merchants, merchants convert to cash, and so the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down.

Thanks! I called Vit Jedlicka for a short interview, will write about Liberland.

If you have cash, there are lots of things that are both doable and needed. But consulting isn't free ;-)

I am listening to the talk now. I am afraid Negroponte's "middle of the road" approach is too much for hardcore libertarians to swallow. But he's just saying that _also_ governments can do good things.

Very cool! Questions to tobyai:
1. what is the role of Mastercard in OneBit? Owner? Funder? Partner?
2. "The magic that happens underneath is done by BitPay who converts your bitcoin and MasterCard, who sends the money to the restaurant" seems to imply that Mastercard is directly involved in the operation, which would be a huge first. Confirm?
3. ETA?

Nigerian scams only work because sending email is free, wouldn't work on paid services like BitcoinFax.

So 130 people died horribly, many others are dying horribly, and you only think of bitcoin? Fuck you, asshole.

Unless the altcoin has lost all value when you want to exchange back to bitcoin.

I am afraid you will have to create a custom wallet service for your site. Then you can implement 2-3 multisig between buyer, seller and you as escrow, and collect a fee.
Of course the ideal implementation would use external wallets instead of custom wallets, but there is no way to do that (yet) that I can see.
I am looking into that for a betting service (same mechanism). Once the two parties agree on a sale/bet, implement 2/3 multisig transaction. If both parties agree the transaction goes forward, otherwise the escrow must take a side.

This is super cool. I guess what will happen is that the powers that be will crush the initiative in no time and persuade Serbia or Croatia to claim the territory. But I will follow the project with very keen interest and I hope it will survive.

I did read the instructions, but assumed solving the problem would take much longer. My bad.

You mean a thought-cop who claims the right to tell people what they must think? No, thanks, my BTC stays in the wallet.

Pichai’s words, “We are doing it in a way so that anybody else can build a payments service on top of Android,” seem to clearly imply that any external Bitcoin payment service will be able to channel bitcoin payments through the Android Pay platform.

re "This is not what bitcoin (proper) needs for mass adoption." - This is what bitcoin needs for mass adoption. Once that happens, there will always be room for bitcoin (proper) being used by those who want to go through the DIY hassles.

UPDATE - I am happy to report that Circle support solved the problem rapidly and professionally. I was advised to use a Circle tool to upload a scanned ID and a selfie, and a few minutes after that my account was updated to $3,000 weekly limits, which is sufficient for me. Thanks Circle, and I apologize for calling you useless. Bitlicense and over-regulations are a pain in the ass, but I see that you are doing your best.

Nothing new here, big money just knows how the market works. The involvement of big money will help stabilizing Bitcoin, which is godo for all.

Because if you want privacy you don't go to a public place where others can see you, take pictures, and report you. You go to a dark street. However, problem solved now - Circle support raised my limits rapidly and professionally.
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:06:44
I never used it, but I think the world needs localbitcoins. Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, regulated (which is probably a necessary condition for future growth), and owned by Bankers&amp;Bureaucrats. Therefore, it's important to keep, protect and foster private cash-in-hand exchange options.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:27:33
Often if you ask for permission you never get a reply, or you get an ambiguous one. So if you want to do something, just do it, and then ask for forgiveness if you have to. It's often the only way to get things done.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:40:38
I think we need a way to exchange physical tokens pegged to bitcoin hand-to-hand, like cash. Like a physical sidechain. Difficult and probably impossible with bitcoin core as it is today, but I guess it can be done.

I am afraid that's always the case, money and sex are by far the best motivators. Nothing to do about that, it's human nature.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust (ticker GBTC)  is the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. It's sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a part of Silbert’s Digital Currency Group.

I believe they are about to start trading now:
The Bitcoin Investment Trust, the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, on Thursday received formal approval for listing on OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX exchange. The fund is listed under the symbol GBTC, and trading is expected to begin early next week.

The post was published in 2014, but it's still interesting in view of current events.
@_date: 2015-10-06 08:04:41
Of course everything can still be of value despite limitations, but sometimes the limitations become too limiting. I earn bitcoin and convert immediately to cash to buy food and pay bills. A $300/week limit means that the rest stays on Circle as volatile bitcoin that can lose all value from one day to the next. That is _worse than useless_.
@_date: 2015-03-12 08:08:30
Did anyone find the report yet?

This is very cool and a very useful service for those who earn their living, or part of their living, in Bitcoin. I can't use the service because I don't live in the US but I can see that it can make life much simpler for bitcoiners in the US. Yes, the fees seem a bit too high.

I guess you are right, all services like Circle are on their way to become useless due to over-regulation. Better the old-fashioned DIY way. I wouldn't like to meet strangers in dark streets to cash out though.

Google Wallet doesn't support Bitcoin.

Wow, FedCoin and EuroCoin implemented via IBMCoin's technology. Something like that is bound to happen, and IBM (if the rumor is true) is making a smart and potentially very profitable move.
IBMCoin would import into mainstream fintech the "real" advantages of Bitcoin - faster and cheaper payments, permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger.
Of course, the cost is giving up the privacy of pseudonymous transactions.
But I am persuaded that privacy solutions like Zerocash (perhaps implemented as Bitcoin sidechains) will be developed, as well as exchanges and bridges to Fedcoins.

Very cool! I will follow this project.
@_date: 2015-10-06 07:24:37
Of course, I could run a client or use a blockchain.info wallet. Circle is convenient because it's a solid mainstream company, they have good security with multi-factor authentication, and (especially) customers deposits are ensured. But I guess one can't have the best of two different worlds at the same time.

They could release some kind of "weakly decentralized" version with the decentralization aspects they want, and without thos they don't want.

Perhaps. This is not cloud mining.
