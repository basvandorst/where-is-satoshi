You asked for proof of people warning that Bitconnect was a ponzi, or that Tether dissolved their auditor relationship. WE DID. Yet you ignore it all and double down. I'm tempted to believe that you're just trolling at this point. In which case good job, everybody believes you're as fucking stupid as you seem.

[I made a post]( in r/tether specifically calling out BitConnect as a ponzi before they tanked. There are also a ton of videos on youtube that were calling it a ponzi / pyramid scheme. People were trying to sound the alarm but these warnings usually fall on deaf ears because of people like you. 
I'm a regular on r/buttcoin but I have traded crypto in the past and made some nice profits. I want crypto to succeed but I don't want to touch the market while Tether has infected 60-70% of all the exchanges. If you look at 24h volume on coinmarketcap you'll see Tether is always  This means that hundreds of millions of fake dollars are artificially inflating the prices of ALL altcoins. 
Tether has basically become crypto's Federal Reserve, but instead of aiming for 2%-4% yearly inflation they print out Tethers willy nilly to raise the price of everything to the moon. If you don't see a problem with that then you deserve to lose any money you've invested.
