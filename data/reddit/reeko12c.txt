The biggest threat to the printing power of the federal reserve is crypto. Medicare, Social Security and the Military depend on America and its unique position to print money. If a goverment entity or maybe some orgainization wanted to destroy America, this is one way to do it. 
As per game theory, I suspect the American and the Chinese goverment have been quietly buying crypto. 
Quite frankly, It wouldn't surprise me if bitcoin was created by either government as we all know the actions of the federal reserve are not sustainable.

8 years? The SEC, IRS, and the FBI have been eyeing bitcoin since its inception. The FBI shutdown of the silk road was in 2013.  In 2013 most Americans didnt know bitcoin existed, but the FBI did. I can guareentee you that much. The average congress person might be clueless, but never underestimate bankers, those in charge of defense, lobbyists, the wealthy, and the vultures who undermine and influence the goverment.

A small minority already own most bitcoin. Bitcoin is a transfer of power from the elite to the elite. Whales have manipulated bitcoin and the entire crypto market for years now.

The elite are not stopping bitcoin because the elite are already in. Whales have been manipulating crypto for years. The elite dont want you or the IRS to know. Why would they? Keeping quiet is smart.

Blockchain is in its infancy and Crypto is setting the stage for permenant seat in Austrian economics. Trump should be loving bitcoin but he's full of crap

doubt it. most of the boomer wealth is tied to real estate. That's why they never shut up about real estate (but they will once the bubble pops)

Bitcoin is manipulated by whales, mastermind group, big banks and governments worldwide. Crypto is not some utopia that protects the smaller fish.
