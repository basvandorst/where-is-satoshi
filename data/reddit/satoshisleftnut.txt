Yea I know.

That amount decreases as more people join, and obviously those with deeper pockets pickup more slack. The point is we need to turn the bitcoin price ship around. A rising price is the best magnet for users. Nobody likes things that sink.

Yea thats the defensive line the developers use so they don't get caught up in legal problems.
Bitcoin can work if we work together instead of everyone attempting to fuck the next guy over.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:24:30
You can't.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:28:07
Because users leave as price declines.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:48:34
Um that makes no sense. A government issued currency supply tends to be manipulated by um the government...
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:46:34
Yea yea bullshit. Nobody likes to be sold. A rising price sells itself.

This is just this subreddit. I'm saying this community MUST turn the price ship around or else we are going to bleed out

Dude you act like the "free market" is some all knowing third party magical entity. A market place at the end of the day consists of people. We are the market. We can decide how something plays out.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:10:34
People like things that rise in value. Fact backs that up. Users surged during every price rise, and stagnated or declined during lengthy price declines.

Stock investing works on tithes....
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:47:51
Tipping is a stupid idea, and no evidence exists that it encourages users to learn about bitcoin.
The best mechanism that encourages user adoption is a RISING PRICE. Nothing else is as important.
The impediment to the rising price is the miner supply. We collectively must absorb this to prevent further price declines. In the long run we will get rewarded with more users and higher bitcoin prices.
If we have 140k in this subreddit buying $8 of bitcoin each, we can effectively absorb all new coins for the next 1.5 years.

The problem is the miners are forced to sell since the hashrate constantly makes it more difficult ie more expensive for them to mine. The supply is hardwired into the code, I agree it would be better if someone developed an algo where crypto supply is based on market needs instead of a linear constant expansion.
We have to deal with what we have, yea Im advocating propping the miners up in the short term to reap rewards down the line. As more and more users come online, the burden is spread across everyone.
Do you understand with a declining price you get a declining interest and userbase? That is not theory that is fact. With a price decline we've seen major slowdown in users...
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:04:30
A rising price is the only sure thing that gets the userbase increasing.

Bitcoin is not new it's 6 years old. Stop giving me the stupid pitch I'm on your side lol.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:51:43
Um real world losses and real people? This is the problem with libertarian computer types they think everything is a 1 or a 0.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:47:26
How do I setup a ponzi scheme ? It's clearly YOU who can't see the problem with the miner subsidy.

Branson is an idiot. Heres a guy who sells airline tickets to none existent plane seats.
Yep strap yourself to a couple ton rocket loaded with jet fuel just because you want to float around in space for 10 seconds. Then act shocked when it ends in disaster.

Actually tithing was in the Old testament, Christianity made it voluntary. Yea nice try at ignorance though.
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:56:57
The problem with falling price is you get people with paper losses who start eventually panicking and selling. Today there are more people with losses then gains, this is pure psychological. They will have a bad taste in their mouth and tell their friends to stay away.
It's better we have a rising price as that attracts more users.

If you can't come up with $240 a month living in a first world country you should reconsider your life choices dude.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:56:36
Im not pumping anything. Everyday miners create 3600 BTC, I am saying we can collectively absorb that supply preventing the price from declining. This will lead to stability and MORE user adoption. Nobody wants something that is declining month after month pal. Bitcoin is in a death spiral...
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:19:02
Dude. The miner subsidy was a major flaw that we are stuck dealing with. Wether you me or r/bitcoin likes it, they are rewarded 3600 BTC per day regardless. I'm trying to come up with a solution so the subsidy doesn't end up killing BTC completely.
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:57:59
Anything you can contribute will stop this bleed.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:27:16
Only Gavin Bell can change the protocol dumbass. You obviously haven't been around long enough.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:17:45
Great job.
Now set another goal, getting into the 10 million club. After that 5 million and then 1million.
One step at a time buddy.
