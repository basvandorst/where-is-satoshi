Not because you acknowledge that networks can grow in either centralised or distributed direction you going to give up your ideology. I think we all agree that we at distributed side. If you check any text book about network theory ( not only data network, but also social network, neural networks etc..) You will see these types of interaction among nodes is even older than Internet itself. But if you agree that centralisation is OK then we all going to be happy inside Google's datacenters ... Is even better for me since we don't need to implement IPV6 ...

Cheap is relative, botnets can be very expensive just try to buy or hire one at deepweb. The point is we don't do science without data to support ours hypothesis. If I had more time and more expertise I would be fascinated to build network models to study how bitcoin networks had grow and perhaps get an analogy how internet become what it is today. Anyway the whole point for me is that now I see that bitcoin network is very centralized and even if is true that ASIC had helped bitcoin at some stage. I dont see now bitcoin as a truly distributed network. Networks are dynamic in the sense the way they grows .. remember that in history banks used to be very decentralized too and that's why I cant give up my ideology, my ideology is my compass that tells me where am I, and what I live for.

As far as I know the AES private key is not generated inside the token, although like ISO 7816-4,-8 specification the key cannot be extracted. It's the same situation where you ask to somebody else to generate your bitcon private key.. How do you know that a copy has not been made ? The token is security as any other OTP is.. like RSA SecurID for instance.

OK lets draw graphs, topology and some story line. In 2008 the was 6 hosts controlled by Satoshi him self. The nature of decentralization among these hosts relays on that the seed nodes have hard-coded network address where other hosts can connect to until it forms a consensus/convergence ( to understand it from networking perspective just do an analogy to tcp/ip layer 3 routing protocol like RIP (the simplest one to understand) so it fair enough one arguers that Satoshi centralized the mining processes at very low diff... even because nobody else except few heros was interested about bitcoin. You can play a bit with simulator like Simbit,   (selfish mining) we going to visualise that the bitcoin network is very vulnerable at this embryo stage. You don't need to be a genius no see that. You argue that botnets would kill bitcoin network at it's embryo stage.. I keen to agree with that but to support that hypotheses you need to show data of botnets attacking bitcoin infrastructure.

Technically two factor means " what you have, what you know " eg. Your chip'n'pin smart card is considered two factor because you have a private key generated inside card that's never goes outside and you have the thing you know, witch is the pin number. It's is not possible to have a copy of your private smart card key. Once you lost your card another key will be generated in another card. Two steps authentication, like google authentication, you have two separated logins. One is time based, the other is your password. Both can be duplicated. Roughly that's the difference between "two steps authentication" and "two factor authentication" ...

You can shutdown botnets because they're illegal. In other hand there is nothing you can do about legal businesses like cex.io to take control of bitcoin mining and in the end of the day the only thing you can do is begging then to switch off their miners. They're more dangerous in that matter for bitcoin eco system. Cryptonight, X11 et al provide a nice balance between CPU and GPU.

How many ASIC manufactures do we have ? from cryptonote white paper "Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto described the majority decision making algorithm as “oneCPU-one-vote” and used a CPU-bound pricing function (double SHA-256) for his proof-of-work scheme. BUT ... Bitcoin creates favourable conditions for a large gap between the voting power of participants as it violates the “one-CPU-one-vote” principle since GPU and ASIC owners posses a much larger voting power when compared with CPU owners. It is a classical example of the
Pareto principle where 20% of a system’s participants control more than 80% of the votes.

Thanks for a nice article. Btw any thoughts about ... "The majority of deployed asymmetric cryptography implementations (RSA, DH, ECDH/ECDSA with GF(p) curves) need to perform calculations on integers that are larger than a single machine word. Just like every software package, implementations of multi-precision integer arithmetic sometimes have bugs. This talk investigates the implications of these bugs and shows how they can be used by attackers to exploit asymmetric cryptographic primitives. Isolating bug patterns and understanding exploitation requirements allows us to develop strategies for automated bug hunting." Source:

Based on CERT’s own disclosure policy, CERT will publish an advisory related to the vulnerability approximately forty-five (45) days (more or less depending on extenuating circumstances) to the general public.

people bought pizza for 10.000 not exactly because the controversial Keynesian school probably they even was aware about it , but because 
1 - It was easy to mining bitcoin; 
2 - nobody knew who, where or how to convince people trade goods/bitcoin.
But the debate is cool and "egos" apart I think it's healthier our community think about it again ...
so let me cut and past from bitcoin wiki..
"Because the monetary base of bitcoins cannot be expanded, the currency would be subject to severe deflation if it becomes widely used. Keynesian economists argue that deflation is bad for an economy because it incentivises individuals and businesses to save money rather than invest in businesses and create jobs. The Austrian school of thought counters this criticism, claiming that as deflation occurs in all stages of production, entrepreneurs who invest benefit from it. As a result, profit ratios tend to stay the same and only their magnitudes change. In other words, in a deflationary environment, goods and services decrease in price, but at the same time the cost for the production of these goods and services tend to decrease proportionally, effectively not affecting profits. Price deflation encourages an increase in hoarding — hence savings — which in turn tends to lower interest rates and increase the incentive for entrepreneurs to invest in projects of longer term."
my doubt here:
"In other words, in a deflationary environment, goods and services decrease in price, but at the same time the cost for the production of these goods and services tend to decrease proportionally"
As far as I can see mining bitcoin just became more and more expensive, bitcoin mining did not get cheap over the time.

How could we call that movement ? millenniusm ? (since the state controls money supplies for millenniums instead ages) LOL.. Secularism's  ( etymology comes the ages that church ruled the europe in middle age isn't it ? .. ( 'Secular', as mplungjan or another good dictionary will tell you, comes from the Latin saecula. There is no perfect translation for this, but 'age' , as in 'spirit of the age' is fairly close.
And that is the cause of the opposite meanings. To an economist or a journalist who is used to thinking of a decade as long enough for entire theories to rise and fall, an age is the longest period imaginable; durable ideas can be age-old and this age is synonymous with 'this world' or 'everything'. But to a theologian, who naturally contrasts 'time' with 'eternity' (hence temporal as both 'time-related' and 'not related to the church') an age is a fleeting moment. Isaac Watts wrote "A thousand ages in Thy sight/ Are as an evening gone"; the mediaeval Dies Irae has the line "Solvit saeclum in favilla", 'he dissolves the age into ashes'. Nineteenth century freethinkers, looking for a term to reflect a philosophy with no belief in eternity, reasonably chose secularism.)

He is a great communicator ... but I prefer when instead talking to the general public he goes more technical... for instance, I wonder what he thinks ( from distributed networking point of view ) about the paper "Optimally Efficient Multi-Valued Byzantine Agreement" ABSTRACT
All known proto
ols for Byzantine agreement (BA) among n players require the message to be 
ated at least (n2
) times, whi
h results in an overall 
ation 
omplexity of at least 
(`n2 ) bits for an `-bit message. We
present the  rst BA proto
ol in whi
h the message is 
ated only O(n) times (the hidden fa
tor is less than
2). More 
retely, for a given syn
hronous broad
ast proto
ol whi
h 
ates B(b) bits for rea
hing agreement
on a b-bit message with se
urity parameter , our 
tion yields a syn
hronous BA proto
ol with 
omplexity O(`n + nB(n + )) bits. Our redu
tion is information theoreti
ally se
ure and tolerates up to t &lt; n=2
orrupted players, whi
h is optimal for the 
onsensus variant of BA. Although this resilien
e is not optimal for the broad-

"The tech giant’s second-quarter results, released last Thursday, came in above expectations, making investors happy, but Google’s revenue growth has been slowing, falling from 29 percent in 2011 to 22 percent in 2012, 21 percent in 2013 and 19 percent last year.
Expenses, meanwhile, increased 22 percent in the last quarter of 2014, rose 13 percent in the first quarter of this year and rose 10 percent in the second quarter.
Google, which provides free meals and many other employee perks, such as massages, gyms and even laundry service, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on data centers and other projects, including self-driving cars, aerostatic balloons to offer Internet access to remote areas and a plan to create high-tech clothing.
The tech giant’s growth rate, however, has slowed and the advertising fees generated by its search engine are under pressure from the small screens of smartphones and other devices, as well as the proliferation of apps for mobile devices.

@_date: 2015-04-13 19:10:28
Maybe, well my view comes from pure networking theory and communications protocols..  It's not easy to explain because we need to breakdown the networking 'actors', 'behaviour' and 'processes' into its essential definitions in orther understand where the scalability limitations can appears. The problem is that generally when we get down to that level networking pitfalls becomes much more abstract and often its not easy to drawing an analogy. TCP/IP works like, imaging a room within 10 people and you need to know what time is at the moment, then you go to each individual asking; 'do you know what time is it now?' , until someone tells you the time. On dissemination model you ask to the crowd (broadcasting), hey does anyone knows what time is it now? The one who knows will tells you, then you can cache the information, and if a neighbor asl to you the you can answer the question much more like how p2p topology should work at networking level... TCP/IP is about location source/destination ... Or you are connected or not that's why we have billions of potential devices capable to receive and forward data but you pay an ISP the get connected. I think the problem is that you guys at application layer are trying to solve problems that should be solved by guys here below at layer 3, but instead you guys develop a p2p model and we do the nasty plumbing down below ... Now imagine if a huge ISP decide to traffic shaping Bitcoin packages ... You need go to Congress asking for politicians to protect net neutrality ... But in practices on daily basis if you pay more you get the best ports on switch .. Simple as that and guess what ? Its hard my friend to have a reliable metrics about it ...

mostly of google's core software are close source protect by well defined patents they're evil like anybody else. 
There have always been closed source Google apps. Originally, the group consisted mostly of clients for Google's online services, like Gmail, Maps, Talk, and YouTube. When Android had no market share, Google was comfortable keeping just these apps and building the rest of Android as an open source project. Since Android has become a mobile powerhouse though, Google has decided it needs more control over the public source code.

There were 756 people in the building at the time.) and why people had made choice to jump even thought they knew they would die anyway. The simplest answer is to stop the pain. Some people have a very sensible personality, lets be honest the prosecutors made huge pressure on him and his family for a Knowledge that mostly should be free.

I need to read the technical white paper, just read on cointelegraph 'Blockchain bloat is a big problem and probably one of the key hindrances to adoption by mainstream institutions. I really like Gavin's proposal to increase block size and believe that will help tremendously. 
Factom takes a slightly different stance. We believe that blockchain technology (like the internet) is made up of layers.' Is he talking about analogy to OSI network layer encapsulation conception ? Like bit (Layer 1) frames (L2), package, segments, data ... ? Its reminds once I was so drunk that I thought my old jalapeno was like a network card...yes need go into matrix down to machines city..) I'll try explain... The only immutable part of networks devices is actually the factory/vendor serial number (Extended Unique Identifier) hard printed on mother board... thats the reason Xerox (who invented Ethernet) has EUI-48bit MAC address 00:00:00, then Cisco ..etc (of course you can trick your OS kernel network stack to forge your own MAC, but the real machine numbers can't be changed ...

I' not talking about individual merits I agree that from that point of view we always going to see contrasts. To clarifies my option I'm talking about the average of collective opportunities. To try to better explain my point of view..

4 - Oh common Idiocracy is a fantastic movie in my opinion.  I'm really skeptical about humanity are getting clever. Here goes my hypotheses -&gt; Individuals have more access to information and it's true since Gutenberg's revolution. Internet makes easier to any individual in the planet to have access to very elaborated and large knowledge database but society as a whole is more crowded and as the French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon well pointed out in his book The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, "The Crowd" is stupid. I think even his work made centuries ago still have support by recent scientific finds, collective mind have IQ like 30 :P . Anyway IQ tests are ok, but one can argue that there are differents types of intelligence like Emotional Inteligence for instance. BTW emitional intelligent is so important that finds from Neurologist Antonio Damasio while studding individuals with brain damage and unable to feel emotions also could not able to active the decision-make part of the brain.
