Question: though crypto is known to be completely unpredictable/highly volatile, if enough people begin applying traditional trading couldn’t it influence the market to behaving traditionally? If institutional investors really are entering the market (with far larger amounts to invest than the layman or “crypto kid”) could the market be manipulated into performing more like the stock market?
Again, there are no answers, it’s crypto. Just food for thought...

Here’s my DIY hardware wallet that I use with Electrum. Like to hear what you guys think

There are different stories with different characters and actors,
But yeah.
Every episode a pig gets banged.
Except in season 3 when a cat got banged, but it turns out the cat was a simulation and it was a pig the whole time.

Thanks! I'll have to check that out.
I have made a segwit enabled wallet on electrum, it's one of the options you can select if you create a normal wallet. I got coinomi on my tablet just to check it out before i did this, tried to send it to the segwit address and couldn't get it to send. Sent it to a basic wallet, then to the segwit, and was able to send to coinbase. Hoping for more segwit support in the future.

For sure. If you're looking for max security, they're the best way to go. My thinking with this is it's my wallet on a device of it's own that I can keep offline. It serves a single purpose and gets my coins off an exchange and in my control. I use all of my devices and all of them on a network and I think would be more at risk. It's an option.

Simple Rick works with crypto more than he works with polarity plating, but he’s no dummy. Simple Rick realized the great potential of crypto currencies watching the price sky rocket to 19k. We captured that moment and run it on a loop for Simple Rick’s mind and the chemicals it makes his brain secrete goes into every single Simple Rick’s Simple wafer cookie.
Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. 
Come home to Simple Rick’s.

I haven’t researched LN as much as I should have(for the longest time it was articles about how it would be adopted  “SOON!”...) it sounds great, but I have some questions
Is it a lightning wallet? Lightning address? What are the main differences between lightning and segwit? Can I send from an electrum wallet to a lightning and vice versa? 
Thanks for any info
