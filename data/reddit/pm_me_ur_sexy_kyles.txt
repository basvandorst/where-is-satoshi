but it's taken 3 days.. that's super long no?
usually deposits to sites take like a few minutes.. i think.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:34:42
yes a copy and paste directly from the binance site, i even did it again today with a smaller btc amount (25$) and it still has yet to process... maybe my friends 3K+ transactions go thru faster like you said, but ill be worried if the smaller amount is credited before the larger one is. :(
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:10:47
is there a way to cancel it? or at least let me pay more in fees to get it quicker?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:15:41
but why? my other friend did a transfer of about 2,000$ btc and it was done in less than 1hr, is that normal?
thanks for your help man, i'l contact coinpot next time for sure!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:44:05
no shit, it's the only terminology morning-chub and cucks alike would understand.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:58:56
nice, now you can buy back in at low 18's
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:36:09
... it looked so good, then i saw it was a fucking superhero movie
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:32
this is what i predicted yesterday, we will hit 50k before the year ends. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:00
holy fucking fuck
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:42:10
if you really don't care about that spare 500$, put it in coinbase, right now, and forget about it, make pretend you cannot touch it for at least a decade. don't sell whatever you do.

when i was 16 i learned about the darknet and buying drugs, i bought 80$ worth of BTC which came out to be 39 btc
spent it all on weed, and every day i wake up i'm a bit sad, because i missed out hundreds of thousands of dollars. today, it hit 500k.
but i still won't let that be the end of it, i'm back up to 2.8 btc, with my goal being at 10btc in the next year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:16
17.5 as we speak
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:27:44
lol we will hit 20k tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:07:50
yeah dude, ok, you mean BTH not BTC.. BTC will never go close to 500 again
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:17
you're a bit late m8
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:46:54


coinbase is more popular, and thus more trusted and known in the community.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:59
I KNOW, IVE HODLed for so long, but my nerves got to me, gonna buy up all the BTC i sold when it dips under 14k. i'm taking a loss,  but better then nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:41
you're absolutely right, this is mostly heard behavior and weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:28
same as calling someone a hood rat, or ghetto. 
it's pretty problematic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:51
not sure if i should be happy, or worried
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:32
i told ya'll 20k before the day ends
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:29:43
it feels fishy, but im getting richer so im happy :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:52
it went under 13k on gdax
12.7k iirc
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:42
yeah, wtf is going on, it went up 20% from yesterday.
i sold at 13.2k a few hours ago expecting it to dip after the 60m hack..
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:27:08
I still have yet to hear the argument as to why insider trading isn’t considered bad... 
I’d like to hear it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:53:54
can help you with that...
and on that note, woody sell all your s&amp;p500 shares and invest it all in bitcoin. 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ profit.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:23:07
what the fuck
buy a plane ticket,
go home
right now
this is like a winning lottery ticket.. almost.
goooooooooo hurry
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:14:29
same thing happened to me, turns out calling them will help
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:11:42
don't invest it all at once.
maybe do what i do, invest 100$ weekly, or daily, that way you can sorta average out your profit/loss.
right now, the market is near an all time high, so just put 100$ a week, or every few days, when it dips under 8k i'd put the rest in at once if it does happen.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:15:52
I'm new to this sub and BTC in general, is saying go to the BTC subreddit bad? I thought they were they same?
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:48:54
look up dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:55:18
if this isn't the greatest bitcoin success story, i don't know what is.
i'm glad that seller scammed you, look at where you are now :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:09:09


@_date: 2017-11-22 23:12:37
i don't even try at this point, everyone just calls it a scam and calls me stupid for wasting time and money into BTC 
sure, ok we'll see about that.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:20:17
is dash a good investment? form 8$ to 450$+
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:05
It definitely is an addiction to food, and an addiction to living a sedentary life style.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:11:33
that or zoechase
22grand just sitting there..
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:40:49
10k is vastly different from 1,000,000
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:23:00
bought one of these for 100$ on ebay, and thought about investing 1k in btc...
it's been sitting on my desk since coinbase can't verify i'm actually a living person. :{
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:06:59
bitcoin won't reach 1 million in your life time, guaranteed.
