people are sick of these bullshit fees and transaction times when there are clearly better coins out there. Literally the ONLY thing btc has is being the first. But remember AOL Motorola and Nokia? The wheel is spinning but the hamster is dead

Also check the part where he’s opposed to a block size limit
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:12:49
slim to none. Just add the market cap of the bottom alts and see how many hundreds it takes just to get to 1 million dollars total

@_date: 2017-08-15 17:47:35
5 euros of btc will be eaten up by the transaction fee. I would wait and save up for a bigger transaction 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:24:10
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:06:25
The value of the alts will tank but the technology will still be there. Something like Ethereum does not need bitcoin to succeed. Something like litecoin would probably fail alongside bitcoin. Blockchain technology is NOT cryptocurrency

you'd make higher profits with cheaper/riskier altcoins but no it isn't too late for Bitcoin. Scared money make no money. This is only the beginning

I have the Trezor and I’ve never had any issues. I like Trezor’s UI. Can’t say anything about the Ledger. Trezor sounds cooler though but it’s all just personal preference

there will be a dip. There are always dips after breaking an all time high. But it could also keep going. But you should definitely get in before B2X

Personally I would buy 2 antminer S9s. Use a few hundred bucks to build a small shed (if you have a yard and don't want to hear 2 hairdryers running 24/7) or make a soundproof enclosure with a cooler (youtube) and use the rest to buy some coins to start a position in Bitcoin.
These things break even in under than 6 months and currently output around 0.9 btc in one year (less as the difficulty increases). A nice trickle of bitcoins beats having a set amount, just like the beauty of passive income. 10k today would get you less than 1.4 btc. 2 antminer S9's will get you 1.8 btc in just over a year. Plus once they become unprofitable (not for a while) you can sell them on ebay for no loss as they would have already paid for themselves in bitcoin. This is just what I would do with $10k right now.

Bitcoin Cash was controversial. Prices dropped and starting rising a couple days before the fork. After the fork the prices kept going up and people were given free money in the form of Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:26:05
you don't care about bitcoin you just care about it's short term market price. GTFO

If Trump REALLY was anti-establishment why has there been no mention of Janet Yellen or the Federal Reserve? Why doesn't he ever mention the 6 CEOs who control all the 'fake news' outlets he loves talking about so much? Why has he continued the war in the Middle East and INCREASED drone strikes on civilians? Why has he never mentioned the Rothschilds, Morgans or Rockefellers? He's just another bankster puppet.
