Yes man. For a start I'll buy some.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:01:59
Typical person, yes man. I was more interested in stock markets. Now, I want to give this a try as well, since I am somewhat convinced about Bitcoins.

Makes sense. Corporates entering would mean a big hand is coming into play.

But unlike stocks which are a derivative of company's performance why would bitcoin crash. Bitcoin is under a bubble and will always remain a bubble. It'll never burst unless some stupid events occur in the globe which would threaten its existence.

Nothings going good in stocks for me, so the reason I felt bitcoin would be much better off
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:53:34
Yes, I know. I hadn't seriously thought of buying until now. I am tracking it since $4500 levels though.

Okay. But I hope, people saying it is a big time fraud, won't turn out to be true. My only fear is if all the major countries join hands one day to ban cryptocurrencies. Still, I think if you need gains, you have to take the risk.

And they don't hate him in a biased manner. They'll compliment him for good things as well. They'll call spade a spade.

I don't take sides, say whatever you want to say. And I don't hesitate to point out rumours however trending the post might be.

If you feel the current Indian govt is left wingers, then get out of your bubble.

Public sector companies are getting privatised, fuel pricing is being directly linked with the market prices, corporates are being given freebies. Whereas there is hardly any socialist reform being pushed. And we certainly can't assign every thing that the govt does is right or left. Govts do tend to extract the pros of right and left wing ideologies. If this govt is leftist we would never be seeing gst being pushed hastily. Though the capitalist reforms might not be visible but certainly they have been atleast initiated.

Lets end here. No point in mudslinging. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:57:29
Anything else to defend?

Don't believe the OP, he is a jackas*. Most idiots have misinterpreted the Prime minister's statement. He had said that if India manages to bring back all the black money, it would be equivalent to Rs.1.5 million per person of the country. This statement was twisted by many and spread the rumours that he'll give each person Rs.1.5 mio once he comes to power.

makes the world blind?

Lol, get your facts right before posting non-sense.
