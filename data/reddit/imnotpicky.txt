Did you read the readme.txt? I think you just have to open the command line and navigate to your python folder. And then run the file with the appropriate options, explained in the readme.txt

I would suggest to make your page more mobile-friendly, it looks kind of weird on my galaxy s3

Altough bitcoins are transfered very fast I think the shipping would take too long for your munchies :)

Are you serious? Money on the bank is considered safe, but speculation is not.

Try to start your command line as an administrator. Instead of windows+r you open your search and type in cmd until it shows up and then right-click run as admin

Well... if you dont have to pay for electricity it will pay for itself eventually, but it will take you a long, long time. 5 GH/s is nothing these days and its only going to be worse

I would advise you to put 50-70% of your paycheck on a bank account. Why? Because you wouldn't be a broke college student anymore. Problem solved!
Seriously, don't do it. Save your money and maybe put 10% of your paycheck in bitcoins. Nobody knows where this ride is going.

I found this
python pywallet.py --passphrase=mypassphrasehere --datadir=C:\path\to\recovered\wallet --dumpwallet

I really dont recommend it if youre not going all in. Since bitcoin got the media attention, the average Joe is buying usb mining rigs from ebay. Im selling my old stuff there too. Everyone wants to mine. Difficulty goes up and will be significantly higher than now because everyone starts mining. If you invest 20k you might do well.  But investing in a single hardware piece against the madness difficulty?

Thanks for your input!

Well no...you have to navigate to your python folder first...you see your current path at the beginning of the commandline... and this wont be your python folder i assume. And maybe copy your wallet in the same directory so you dont have to enter a long path for the wallet

On windows you press windows+r and type in "cmd". This opens the commandline tool. You navigate through folders with "cd &lt;foldername&gt;". You may have to google basic command line tutorials...why dont you post the exact error you got?

Buy low sell high? Why is the amount of BTC more important than anything else to you?

Did you install the necessary plugins as stated in the readme.txt? Anyway, i could try to fix your wallet if you send me the wallet.dat.  I know that if im able to make it work again I could do whatever I want to the wallet, but if you dont manage to solve it you get nothing anyway. There are lots of tools and stuff but nothing noob friendly.

If you get it tomorrow it would be a good investment. But you wont. You will get it in a year, and the difficulty rises about 20% per week. Do the math :)
