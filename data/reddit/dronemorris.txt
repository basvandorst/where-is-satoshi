Nice joke with Bitcoin : D

Perfect and short explanation of this funny crypto pic : D
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:58:44
Even more funny is that many still don't understand crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-30 12:18:06
Very nice Bitcoin price!
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:13:44
And let's hope that Bitcoin will be up at least next 832 days.

Big companies like Starbucks could do even for global crypto adoption.

I like the slogan "your Bitcoin shop" most of all. Cool news anyway.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:43:08
It's always very unpleasant even to think about this possibility.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:31:49
This video with Bitcoin always makes me laugh.

Pure crypto history, hope that these 11 years were just a start of everything.

Very interesting and not popular decision taken by this exchange.
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:00:40
Maybe rather soon they'll understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:53:54
Hope this won't happen with Bitcoin.

Offline ads with crypto are cool way to promote assets among people.
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:56:05
Seems that you're right regarding Tether. Everything is just a result of hysteria and journalists unprofessionalism.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:22:58
Yes, many have already compared Bitcoin with the start of Internet.
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:06:58
Cool that such big companies make tweets with crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-06 09:22:26
Very funny video with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:56:39
Really like Bitcoin promotions like this one : D
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:02:33
Cool ad with Bitcoin. Very nice that there are more and more offline ads with crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:54:07
We need more crypto ATMs like this one : D
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:35:01
People should be aware of crypto and everything connected with it.
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:25:03
During recent months everybody wants to regulate and people using it.
@_date: 2019-09-13 13:29:07
Regarding crypto more and more governments press the second button.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:49:48
Tether is the part of the market and it just follows market law.
