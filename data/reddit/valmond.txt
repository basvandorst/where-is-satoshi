Pump &amp; dump scheme ensues...

Can yo, at all, stock say a string in the block chain today?
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:59:08


There is only one way to do a double spend. There are no other "exploitable vulnerabilities" to do that except if someone was able to use GHash:s hashrate at its own will (which I doubt but I don't know for sure).
A double spend can be successful with 25%, and is 100% guaranteed if you have 51% as GHash has today.

Well you are right there, it is sensationalist but IMO it should be!
**This might be the worst thing that have ever happened to bitcoin** and maybe to all of the crypto currencies.
I get the impression that saying "FUD" is an easy way to just try to forget about the problem, a problem that should not be forgotten at all.

hey, check this out:
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:47:47
Well, you can print new dollar bills but you can't make up for lost Bitcoin by making some more.
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:02:37
Isn't the weight-problem the same as the pruning-problem?
All old transactions nobody cares about lies around in the block chain and takes up space :-)
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:04:05
Sure, the article can be a fake, then please say so.
But you are talking strangely:


That seems very very strange, if that was true then it is bet coin dices security that has an enormous problem because just by orphan forks they'd loose transactions.
And if GHash exploited that then well yeah, they are "known 51% attackers" to me anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:56:30


Wouldn't it be an interesting solution for an alt-coin with a fast payout (like Doge who 'finishes' in June 2015)?
With another algorithm and low incentive, there might not even be an upgraded software? Of course, if there is enough incentive by the price of Doge, software might be written.
But, isn't it an arms race anyway? Maybe the protection must adjust dynamically because there will always be a loophole when you trust a global network?
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:15:11
So you were lying about nr 3 ?
Can't find any pointers to any ownership change.
You are from GHash.io maybe?
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:49:09
A 50 yard dash to start with...
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:36:52
But true :-)
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:30:31
Had to read up a bit about colored coins and I see, it is brilliant actually! Thanks for telling me about it.
I'd love to see the blockchain useful for other things too, a sort of decentralised internet of sorts...
The back side might be that it's maybe too brilliant to be created/accepted/used (or at least for a long time) 
now when there are so many of those alt-coins everywhere where you can get scammed much better and so.
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:55:35
Except that you don't want to create an ASIC for a heavy memory intensive algo. A CPU is actually better and cheaper here as it is Versatile. *sigh* this Lee character... in his Litecoin world...
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:17:28
Okay Downvotor, you are right and GHash are the nicest people out there, lets trust them as they only attacked once when they didn't have the full power... sigh
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:20:56
Well hopefully but I don't think it will help make it happen faster if people scream FUD when you talk (even sensationally) about it.
I mean, I'm not here screaming Everybody Panic Sell or something... just raising (again) the question that isn't resolved and that Will break cryptos if not solved.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:17:27
1) They do occasionally and that is like the big problem here. not if they have 51% at 11h00.
2) This, for me, just shows that they ARE people attacking! Those people are bad guys and they (see 1) have had and most probably will, have 51% of the network making it very probably they'll do it again!
3) Fair enough didn't know but haven't seen the slightest info about that, can you link some proof about it?
4) When they have 51%, they don't need that, they can revert a 100 confirmation transaction if they want to. Back then they couldn't so they just did what could do at the moment. Bad enough IMO.
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:55:56
I have not lied or spread FUD except if that article is a scam.
Well whatever, talking about it seems forbidden here.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:00:34
Hi killerstorm, you seem to know your way around.
What do you think about those two questions / ideas?
If I were to move some big money, I guess this is what I'd do:
1) Monitor the altcoins network hashrate.
2) use a lot of confirmations (I understand this doesn't make it more secure per se but it would take more time)
I'm from the Dogecoin community so say 60 verifications would take 1h.
If there is a 51% attack in the making, someone is taking a lot of hash rate off alt-coins networks and that would be seen (say 60GH/s hash rate disappears from LiteCoins network a couple of minutes before the transaction).
Wouldn't that be enough to show an attacker is in the works?
Secondly, what do you think about changing the Scrypt algorithm to another one (roughly the same memory requirements but different), wouldn't that make it complicated for multi pools to switch miners hash rate from/to that alt coin?
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:49:54
A second question,
Couldn't the solution be a combination of a special algorithm and ASIC:s for a specific coin?
It would create a network linked to one (and only one) coin.
Isn't this what makes Bitcoin so strong, there are no other networks with hash that is usable on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:50:51
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:13:36
Or more like 0.0000000... fuck did I put in enough zeroes there?
Doge really Is easier, just sayin
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:54:57
Well, back it up with some facts then. Just you Saying it is FUD is not enough.
Whatever, the attackers now control Bitcoin, welcome to the new Bitcoin 2.0 Centralized currency.
@_date: 2014-06-17 08:58:43
Well it is not, at least according to the article, GHash have tried to do a 51% attack and now has the possibility to actually do it fully.
Please specify why this is FUD...
[edit] and yeah, downvote of course.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:35:20
Well hopefully someone will be smart enough and cook up a solution so we won't know if it breaks it or not.
But old attackers gaining control of the network, I think most people doesn't really understand how bad it is. There is most likely a very big resistance in the bitcoin holders though and we'll ride out the storm eventually / hopefully. It's not up to GHash though (there can/will be others), it is up to the miners IMO.
Anyway, downvoted to oblivion, I'm off, thanks for the discussion though.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:23:53
(Only to clarify myself, I didn't think of any special modification of the blockchain itself, only the POW.)
Ha, yeah but you are fighting a loosing battle there (people even spawn alt-coins just for fun). True about ASICs though, LiteCoin is already valuable enough for it (even if the ASIC:s aren't specially powerful yet).
But do you think there should be only one coin, or if you think it should be only one alt-coin, why not stick with Btc?
Anyway, is it even possible to merge say LiteCoin &amp; DogeCoin? I'm asking as you seem to suggest something like it.
Please do tell what vision you have of a modified block chain and why/how it might work.

I'm sorry but my government is not allowed to take my things because I forgot to fill out a form or if I carry around cash.
If I make a (IIRC) 35.000€ wire to another bank account, TRACFIN will be notified for example, but no rights violation will occur.
I live in France.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:23:48
No, is either misinformed or full of bs. There is a lot of counter examples but that doesn't seem to matter.
~~Maybe lives in Sweden? It's worse there for cash and so.~~
[Edit] Seems like prepaid cards do exist in Sweden. Still a hassle to pay with 'ol cash :-)

Yeah, and it's called fake news.
It's complete bullshit.
