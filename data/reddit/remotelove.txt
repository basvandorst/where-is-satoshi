If I am not mistaken, Amazon handles the streaming traffic so it may be a geo-location thing. I never missed a beat on GDAX through this ordeal. 
Edit:  Correction.  There are actual humans trading on GDAX now.  The bots are all confuse, and there is real lag. Lulz.  :P

Been looking over the code for the last few days.  It's just as bad as anything I have ever seen come out of the government.  The exploits are nifty and all, but the rest of the code is shit.

Well, to speak frankly, its you and everyone else that is trying to panic sell is the problem.   CoinBase is not a trading platform, its a bare-bones user friendly exchange platform.  GDAX might fit your needs.
Panic sells always lose you money.  If anything, you should be buying more to cover the loss... Well, its probably too late for that now too, as we have just seen a massive snap-back.

Zero-day exploits only become outdated when they are public or are no longer relevant to the hardware/software market.  I assure you, many companies are still running those older versions of firmware.
The tools that were included are hardly any different than the tools used now to build and deliver exploits.

User created DoS.  GDAX is fine.

Cool.. scrypt or scryptN?

ButtCoin already tanked with LegCoin, ArmCoin, PenisCoin and some of those others...  did I miss any?

People don't realize how fucking difficult it is to cover your tracks.  I gave up on this alt a long time ago, so my life is basically an open book as far as I am concerned.
WordPress?  Really?  That is just utterly stupid.  What the actual fuck is this fake-satoshi thinking of besides web traffic?
I am 99.999 percent sure that some good 'ol statistical text analysis will debunk this.  I  know jack shit about statistics but the data is there to enjoy and fondle.
I'm with Lee on this one: Genesis key signing or STFU.
Edit: lulz. "99.999% percent" is not a thing.

This sounds really dumb.  To some degree, I understand runaway inflation, but wouldn't the simple solution be just to stop printing physical money and cause a supply shortage of cash?  By updating the currency and dropping zeros that is just making the problem worse, right?
There would need to be severe restrictions imposed on digital banking to curb the issue as well, but I doubt that is much of a problem in countries that have this issue.

"I, I, I, I, my, my, my".   That's all I read in the opening paragraph of the reveal.
"when its usage was hijacked for illicit means"...... Oh STFU.  That's not how any of this works.
Fucking kids.
Edit: I put more thought into this Reddit shit post than that kid did in the first two paragraphs.  AND I am still a bit tipsy from last night.

Yeah, actually.  It is.  Bitcoin completely numbed me to buyer's remorse.  If I don't lose 10% the second I decide to make a buy, I start worrying.
Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down.  It always goes down after you buy and it always goes up after you sell.  (Ok, this is silly, but it's a good mental exercise to help avoid bigger losses.)

Fuck yeah!  But she dropped the barbie stage about 10 years ago, though.  We like making money and stuff and the only thing that makes her happy are technology things.  Hell, she inherited a 4 GPU PC from 2014 to get her through her gaming stage.

Fuck-off downvoters.  If this is not pro-BTC, you need to go back to STR or something.

Agreed.  Having a massive wallet makes someone a target, pseudo-anonymous or not.  The only way I would touch a massive wallet is through a burner phone in a third-world country before I lost most of it through shoddy coin tumblers....
... unless, of course,  you are Paul Vernon and you can move coin out of wallets into other exchanges virtually​ unnoticed since he was in China and all...  
Sorry all /s and still a bit bitter about my 5 coin that I gave to that dude.

That would be me.  Just pay the xfer fees of 6.99BTC and you can have a miniscule sum of my fortune.

Agreed.  I am actually surprised they still published.  Granted, we are only at ~28 day lows, and its not really _that_ big of a swing in price compared to what we are used to.

Umm... Speculation reasons are silly.  It's simply a math issue. IE:  You don't make money "on the way up", you make it "on the way down".
At the end of the day, some old fart had 20k coins to dump the price.  Once he dumped those coins, he could then profit off of the volatility of the market after that event.  What is the goal?  Do you want more cash, or do you want more coin?  Increase the price of the item to get cash, decrease it to get more coin.
Multiply that by the number of rich fucks out there who like to trade BTC, and it turns into a bag-holder game.  Note how the price (After the last $700 spike) looked like someone held a long pipe at one end and snapped it.  (ie: Sproioioioioioiiiiing!)  All the involved "high-stakes" traders are bound by liquidity and volatility.  They can move the market, but there are a million more people who can move the market better than they.  So, its easier to operate trades in percentages.  While I don't know the proper terms for this, you can negate the cost of a high-price trade over time by ensuring that you can continue to trade that capital/coin several times.  Most "pumps" or "dumps" operate on some simple rules:  Your profit must increase, or your coin must increase.  To move a market just for the hell of it is a loss, and free coin for all! 
It then becomes a high stake-holder game of trading 200-300 coin at a time for cash.  When you get too many coin, you sell in hopes of getting more coin to buy at a lower price.  When you get too few coin, you sell at a higher price to get more cash.
Regardless, If I had a few thousand coin to dump, I would sell most of it, and enjoy the market volatility that ensued.  Sorry for the alcohol induced shit explanation.
tl;dr: These are coordinated dumps to generate volatility.  Study your time-zones for more info.
Edit:  There are limits to what one or a group of people can do.  In this case, we had major exchanges involved in this one, most of which affected each other.  Once you start the volatility, have fun and enjoy the ride.
Edit2:  You may have heard the  rule in trading anything:  Buy low, sell high.  Well, there are modifications to that:  Sell low and buy lower, or Buy high and sell higher.  Same thing, just a different twist on the perspective.  If you have the capital to move a market, all three of those "sayings" will get you a net profit.  Even more so if you know what direction the market is going to move in.
