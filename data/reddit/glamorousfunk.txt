Yeah, you're totally wrong.

That's usually how my deals look in civ 5.

Bitcoin Unlimited would be 'Bitcoin'. You'd be selling your BTC for the minority chain which is not 'Bitcoin'. 
You might want to read up on the white paper as it seems you don't understand what Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin Unlimited will be BTC though. So you'd be selling BTC for the minority chain coin which is not Bitcoin as per the white paper. 
Maybe do some research.

Bitcoin Unlimited would be 'Bitcoin'. You should read the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:32:51
'Their' chain would be 'Bitcoin'. Try reading the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:31:07
Minus the fact that it would be 'Bitcoin' and thus BTC. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:27:28
Uh no it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:43:10
You're doing the same thing buddy.  
Edit: someone has to provide some truth here. So I'm starting small with a simple message in the hopes some of you can actually understand.

No BU would be Bitcoin as per the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:37:26
Which would be Bitcoin Unlimited.

That's not even remotely close to what he's saying. What a misleading title. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:14:49
Man you're an idiot and so are the people who believe you. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:40:34
It's almost funny how insecure they are
@_date: 2015-11-25 23:14:55
Why do you have so many bank accounts... 
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:22:20
Oh god I decided to sell some under performing stock last week and I still don't have the money in my account. It's actually ridiculous the hoops I'm jumping through just to access my own money. Bit bummed I missed this initial rise because of that.

Domino's in Canada really stepped their game up and was my go to place for delivery a few years back. Moved out of country so can't comment on the current quality.

No only Apples. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:57:47
I tried doing this myself to myself. Australia to Canada. I lost about $100 than if I had wire transferred to myself.

Hire me to go door to door telling people to use Bitcoin at your shop. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:57:52
You're a good man. Or woman. Let's just go with person.

You sir, are one cool cat.
