If you've held this long, might as well go all the way man.

True, you can't know for sure. But you also don't NEED to know for sure. You don't need 100&amp; accuracy, you only need to predict with a 51&amp; accuracy to turn a profit in the long run. You just need a slight edge so that your net wins outweigh your net loses. Combine that with smart risk management and you can do alright with swinging.

On binance you can just sell into tether instantly.

Also forgot to mention, if you buy btc on another exchange, it might be cheaper to turn it into LTC or ETH first before transfering it to binance, to reduce fees.

If you get into the exchange it's really easy. But tether it (supposedly) going to stay at 1USD at all times. So if you see BTC start going down, just buy USDT.. then when it starts going back up you buy BTC. You can check a youtube video to see how it's done, it's pretty easy. This all assumes that tether doesn't one day collapse though...

So what I did was buy some btc on another exchange, then transfer that to my wallet in binance. I don't think you can buy directly with fiat on binance. Once you get the btc on binance it's easy trading.

FYI, 50% accuracy is considered perfectly fine in TA. Risk management is more important. If your wins are 2x as big as your losses, you still make money even with a 50% (or even 40%) winrate.
