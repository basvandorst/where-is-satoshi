"The bitcoin growth curve mirrors the standard chart of virus expansion."
lol, is this what the bitcoin community is telling themselves now? You know what the growth curve looks like: a bubble. 
fk me running, i want to meet the delusional chump who gave you gold. Amazing. And you know what the worst part is? The bubble you guys are helping to blow up with these false equivalencies will take out not just your shit currency, but tons of other ones that actually have something to show for in terms of technological progress.

Don't delude yourself. The bitcoin network is in many ways now already owned by blockstream. This has now been clearly shown by the fiasco that was segwit2x and the hard push towards the lightning network. This will only get worse as the congestion and fees on the main bitcoin chain get worse. When the lightning network happens naturally most if not nearly all transaction volume will move to the lightning network or any other liquid sidechain blockstream develops (if they ever develop it and it works successfully, but that's another topic with more math). Here's the part I can't stress enough: Currently all tx fees go to the miners, which maintains a decentralized system (when we disregard that most miners are in China), however under the lightning network all fees will go to liquidity providers/exchanges. Per blockstream themselves:
(Lightning fees are paid to peer-to-peer liquidity providers, and not miners) — Nov 2017 Blockstream leaked investors email
So there you have it, with the lighniting network the decentralized / miner controlled network is now a centralized exchange/bank controlled network. That's the bitcoin "unowned" vision for the future....controlled by exchanges....real nice 
As a side note Alts don't need bitcoin, the dwindling bitcoin transaction volume compared to alts pretty much proves this.

I've been using btc since 2013. I no longer do at this time for any of my crypto transactions because the network is useless.

you don't have to get on with the moral part, it's business after all. It is what it is and we don't need to virtue signal. What you should care about is the fact that future investors will. The "green police" and the hippies out there will eventually make this a big deal once POS becomes available from other protocols such as Ethereum. Investors grandstand and virtue signal after all even if on an economic basis it makes no real sense, that's why every major corp has shareholders demanding "green initiatives". Its just one of the many ways that bitcoin is falling behind technologically and one of the many reasons it's death is inevitable...not today probably...the issue isn't big enough yet, even though many developers who know better have jumped ship to other crypto projects months ago. Bitcoin Core will never allow something as drastic as POS even if we get to an absurd level of congestion and energy use where one transaction will be equivalent to a small towns daily power consumption (only one order of magnitude away).

also I find it morally wrong at this point to even support a network as energy inefficient as bitcoin:
