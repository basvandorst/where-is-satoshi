The chances are low, but not zero.

I don’t have the money could also mean he doesn’t want to dip into savings or emergency fund, so he “doesn’t have the money” even though he has thousands in the bank. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:28:08
Your "I told you so" will come shortly. This shit is nothing.

In the short term. Having more credit cards will boost your score in the long term.

I didn’t say it will crash. I’m commenting on his logic based on the worry about it crashing. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:48:09
If the worry is the USD completely crashing, paying that penalty is nothing if you wanna hedge. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:06:27
No, actually its value might even go up. It’ll just be bought and sold in the black market. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 06:41:34
Is that a mining CPU?!
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:28:54
Every philosophy is self serving.  Hers is just honest about it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:10:15
How can they prove you are aware even when you're using it?  Aren't you just sticking with "not guilty" and not actually saying anything about nullification?  They'd have to prove you actually knew about nullification to charge you with perjury. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:54:33
Nobody knows 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:27:03
I don't disagree with any of that. Just pedantically pointing out it wouldn't literally be impossible. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:57:43
Which is the same as selling.

Your not going into debt if you have the money to pay the cc bill in full.

You don't understand ponzi schemes and probably don't understand why bitcoin is valuable. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:24:12
Bitcoin is simply the first to gain this much traction. Bitcoin is not the end all be all. If it fails, that says nothing about crypto as a concept. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:51
No, more people buying it isn't what's driving up the prices. More people wanting it is. The act of buying implies that someone is selling, so obviously that person in particular is no longer hodling. It's not a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:10:55
Of course. It'd be a completely different world. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:59:32
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:32:10
Because another coin that does more transactions better probably won’t be as good of a store of value. Probably won’t have the deflationary aspect. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:14:00
People falling for this means miners predictably make more. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:51:49
Exactly. If the community as a whole didn’t find it helpful, it would be downvoted. If it’s upvoted, it’s still informative. If you’re here so often that upvoted posts are all reposts for you, maybe you’re here too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:05:11
It hasn’t run its course, it just might be taking on a different role than everyone originally thought. It’s looking like a better store of value than a day to day currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:58:25
No it wouldn't, it would mean the dollar tanked. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:29:09
Practicing online against bots could be a good starter for playing people live.

Those flags are not where they should be. They’re just scattered randomly.

What's an investment that doesn't have this issue?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:32:22
Have you ever listened to Joe's podcast? It's not an information dense seminar. They're having a conversation and at one point bitcoin is explained. 
Even if it was 3 hours of dense information, that's pretty accessible. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:51:41
Bitcoin has no central operating authority, so nukes are pretty useless against it unless you nuke the world. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:47:11
How much is the most you'd keep on a single hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:16:17
Seems like the community is just gonna avoid these shitty iterations these guys come up with. Why are they a threat? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:37:44
This is the exact same thing as saying "don't buy that with cash because it can go toward bitcoin and be worth blah blah blah later." There's opportunity cost with everything you spend money/time on. Can't live life penny pinching. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:16:30
Lol on its face it is funny 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:19:01
Holy shit that's crazy. 
Who's your go-to to buy? I have a trezor wallet, so I just need somewhere to buy and pass along. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:32:41
The US Dollar is the world's reserve currency. Things have to change on a massively larger scale than those other examples. We probably won't see it in our lifetime. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:45:08
What's your sense of a good number for the average person? Does it vary so wildly you can't answer that?
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:26:20
It's not likely to the degree that it's worth the risk. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:05:11
Ok, so stop using my coin base account. Got it. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:22:28
2 things. 
1. Understood that it wasn't your main concern, but I don't understand how it's a concern at all. Logically I don't get it. How does the amount you have to contribute factor at all and what's an investment that doesn't have this concern attached so I can get a comparison to better understand. 
2. What barrier of entry? You can go to coin base and buy bitcoin in about a minute. Now, setting up your own bitcoin wallet and storing large amounts of bitcoin if you don't wanna put all your trust in coin base? That'll take about 30 minutes of research to learn, if that. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:43:52
You did get lucky. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:57:51
I'm pretty much Joe Hodler. How do I ensure I don't help them in any way? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:59:29
Do they have any good points? Anything valid about the move to 2mb making it easier for bitcoin to be controlled centrally?
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:25:24
No, deflation means the reduction of the general level of prices in an economy. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:00:38
There would simply be a mad scramble to hide bitcoin in anonymous addresses. It's too easy to hide and governments are not as all powerful as you seem to think. 
Shit, it would probably make it more valuable after the initial drop.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:26:09
What's wrong with it?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:30:46
Is Breadwallet an exchange, or do I actually own/control the bitcoin I have there?
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:55:20
Come again?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:04:34
Language is a consensus. You're going against the consensus. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:16:46
Right, so he needs to cash it and get it somewhere safer. Not change his fucking identity. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:56:19
That would be an example of things changing on a massively larger scale. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:00:21
Watch the Joe Rogan podcasts with Andreas Antonopoulos. They're 3 hours long each and get really in depth. You could probably just watch the first one where they really get into the basics of what it is. 
Just google:
Joe Rogan experience 446
Joe Rogan experience 581
Joe Rogan experience 844

Isn't bitcoin slow in nature? Especially if it gets adopted by a significant portion of the world ?
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:17:46
Yeah. Not really relevant. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:46:00
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:24:47
Deflation- Reduction of the general level of prices in an economy. 
That's the definition. So you're right about it being misleading, just wrong about who was doing it. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:05:59
Read the whole thread. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:13:43
Who are you satirizing?
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:54:43
Exactly. In the system we have, the way to do that is charging them with fraud. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:58:16
People thought the first death that occurred because of driverless cars would destroy the idea in the media. People have died and there really was no impact. 
You don't know that it'll be a big deal. Might not even be much of a story when it happens. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:20:13
Social networks work exactly the same way though. Facebook had to overcome the same problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:43:38
Ok, well this is a situation you would use private security or vigilante justice then, correct? They stole your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:13:58
Would you consider that event to be on a massively large scale?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:28:46
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:27:59
Not if society as a whole has decided to call tungsten gold already. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:36:08
Well, not completely. Keeping it on an exchange really isn't hodling, right? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:52:34
The level of security you get from a software wallet is adequate for $600. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:53:38
But I'm pretty sure it's common even among economists. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:05:18
Wtf? No. Rich people dont have to change their identity. He just needs to be careful for the next few months, especially before he cashes those coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:40:31
So much in the same way MySpace was carried for a few years because its name was dominant at one point? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:57:50
GOX was hodling. Anyone that had their coins there didn't have actual possession. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:33:58
Ok, but you do realize we don't exist in your ideal system right? In this system, the government handles fraud and theft. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:34:26
In your voluntarist system, how is fraud and theft handled?
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:49:30
Does Bread wallet on my iPhone work too?
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:21:30
Also, anyone you trust on twitter I should follow?
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:27:59
So litecoin, ethereum, and ?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:57:27
GOX was hodling. Anyone that had their coins there didn't have actual possession. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:28:11
Ever 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:03:52
I'm just buying some every paycheck. I don't wanna deal with the headache of trying to guess when to buy. It's too unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:11:28
Plus, with so many people speculating there is bound to be some that have been very right all along the way. Still doesn't mean they know what will happen again in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:44:02
Dude, this has nothing to do with bitcoin as a network. This is a company taking your money for bitcoin, then switching your coin to something else. Is the new coin having "bitcoin" in the name confusing you? If coinbase switched all your coin to ethereum without asking you, would you still think it's not a fraud issue? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:39:16
Nobody was hodling on GOX
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:55:45
Do you think the government should be involved in cases of theft?
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:54:00
Can't you just write the numbers down instead of printing?
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:49:52
Read the whole thread before replying without understanding the context. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:48:57
We're talking about a moral hypothetical. Jesus, never mind. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:03:40
This has nothing to do with protecting the coins. This is fraud/theft. That is the governments domain. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:12:05
I'm just buying some every paycheck. Not even going to attempt to buy low. Too unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:18:57
I didn't say impossible. I said a massively larger scale than those other examples he tried to equate it to. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:15:24
What do you say to those that think bitcoin is the MySpace of cryptocurrency and something else will be the eventual king?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:50:00
By that logic, you shouldn't use any government supplied benefit at all. I know you don't stick to that. You use roads, you rely on the police, etc. The world you're describing is a fantasy. If you want to indulge in it, cool. But silly to criticize others for using the tools at their disposal, especially considering if they tried to use the method you describe it would get them thrown in a cage. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:57:39
GOX was hodling. Anyone that had their coins there didn't have actual possession. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:45:35
They did have one in MySpace. But yeah, it wasn't a need in the same way. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:04:38
On a side note, since you seem really into the theoretical side, I've found [geolibertarianism]( to be a way government could "tax" in a way that isn't theft. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:21:51
No, small pockets can be while the consensus decides what goes in the dictionary. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:42:44


Problem?  Shit, I'd say bitcoin did its job at that point.
