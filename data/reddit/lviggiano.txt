It's a bug in the mobile client. Check the desktop client, it will probably be fine.

I use coinbase pro. 0.25% fees, they support instant fiat transfers from my bank.
Widthdraws are quick and they do not apply miner fees.

Ask an expert to mentor you.
You need a wallet. You need a sticker "we accept bitcoin". You may need to let people know: write a letter to the newspapers so that you get also some free advertising on the news. I would pay you in btc with no problem: at the current exchanges it makes no difference in paying with btc or fiat. You may want to grant some discount to btc payers (like 5-10%) to incentivate people to spend. If they are savy, they should be glad to spend bitcoin (they can buy btc any moment).
You need a mentor to know how to store your btc safely and advice you on taxes. I am available in Italy to help any vendor who is willing to accept bitcoin.

My brother had his account and apartment seized by the bank after losing the job. His neighbor too.
Got my house almost seized in 2012 for a tax misunderstanding that I demonstrated to be ok, but I had to pay 1200 euro to my accountant for doing so.
Italy here.

He coul have spent way much lower fees. The inputs are strange, a lot of tiny tx. Many of them 666 sats. Dust attack maybe. 
Possibly he upgraded his wallet to a new one.
