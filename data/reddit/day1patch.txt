For anyone unaware this is pretty big as far as Germany is concerned. Sido &amp; Savas are two of the biggest names in German rap, still heard by many and Sido has hit mainstream (with less liked but still good pop-rap mix). Actually the song is pretty nice on its own. If anyone's interested I'll write up a translation of the lyrics. 
Edit: Urg, some of those lesser known names... The song is like Crypto itself, a couple big names and a lot of shitcoins.

I connected both the phone and the desktop eclair to the acinq node so in theory routing should be possible and easy. 
I chose 'open channel' in eclair windows, is there something else needed? I'll see if I can send from windows to yalls.org or there is something basic wrong. 
Edit: Sending works yes.

I've been saying for some time that the best way to drive adoption would be to create a crypto-only porn site. Not even 'we accept crypto' but 'we accept nothing but'. Get people on board, I know steemit for example already has a decently sized nsfw community and grow it with exclusives.

If that makes it to mainnet that'll be a really nice entryway for people to get into lightning. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:36:34
Amazing, I can't wait for that. Could you give a short overview of how you built that? I just finally managed to set up my full node (yeay) and I'm not sure how exactly you'd accomplish receiving on a phone. I think the other day you mentioned a 'workaround until watchtowers are here', I'd love to know how. 
PS: Amazing how fast progress is being made these past weeks.

@_date: 2018-05-03 14:31:33
I think that is pretty safe to say. You can use eclair on android right now just fine and it takes very little reading, but you can only send LN transactions from mobile and not receive until watchtowers are implemented. 
Sounds all very technical but it's really easy, just one bitcoin transaction to the lightning wallet, a click on 'connect to acinq node' and then you can start paying with LN. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:06:41
You seem to be deeper into the whole developement, is there a timeline for watchtowers?

Damn you are right about the attack, the others you mentioned are within the white part of the B.

it is a trade-off, the only way to monetize a site like reddit with a 'service worth paying for' would be to limit already existing services with paywalls, pay-for-running-your-own-subreddit etc. I'll happily buy the odd piece of reddit gold for a service this good and free.

the only thing really working and being used right now seems to be main.yalls.org, but there's also the blockstream store etc. 
It's a bit weird actually, the phone app seems much easier to use, for example when opening the initial channel my phone offered me to connect to the acinq node and on pc I had to manually find and copy the node uri for some reason

* The little icon seems to be [this]( as per a comment above. The log of the number below it comes out to 2.40993312333, no idea if that means anything though. Maybe if multiplied with the longer numbers they are part of the seed, who knows. 
* There are exactly 24 bip39 words fully within the white area without any intersections, I feel that is too much of a coincidence. Posted below because I'm seriously running out of my skills here. OP also hinted that at least half of the words can be ignored, I think I might be on a right track there. 
* I also ran the words that intersect with the white circle, but it only comes out to 6 or so matches with BIP39
Edit: It's also exactly 24 matches for intersections with the white line:

Most likely we are looking at the words that make up your mnemonic phrase for the private key to the wallet. Most likely it's a 24 word seed (could be 15-24 in increments of 3 and 24 is pretty much standard). 
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:01:01

I see the greatest potential in self-publishing of ebooks and media files, something like amazon kindle / smashwords etc. just based on BTC. 
That lightning as a service would be quite useful for the time being, but eventually it would become obsolete as soon as there are proper ways for the average user to receive funds on phones so that time would likely be wasted.

A lot of people are against exchanges because you technically don't have full control over your money as you have when it in your own wallet. That being said coinbase is probably the entry point for a majority of newcomers (myself included, used litebit.eu for recent purchases) and I think that makes them an important part of the whole BTC world. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:46:37
I love this trend so much. Also I'm envious of all you lucky fucks who can afford a tesla. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:50:21
The fees are relatively high as opposed to other methods, for example using litebit.eu with sofort (instant) payment is still a bit cheaper than the 6% you pay before your BTC lands in your wallet with coinbase. That being said I don't see any problems with Coinbase and find them to be very convenient to use so there's nothing totaly wrong there.

What I thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:40:19
I've read that bitcoin traffic is relatively easy to identify for internet providers so in theory there could be a soft-ban if governments become really anxious of crypto (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't actually verified this). Of course there would still be the possibility of peer-to-peer networks at that point, but it would make it hard for average-joe to use crypto currencies and mass market adoption is exactly what drives its value.

You do you man :)

Nothing really, it just always strikes me as odd and I decided to poke fun at it :)

Absolutely, I also talked to him on Slack a while back and he's a super helpful guy.

She's a beauty! A little less BTC, but [here's what I got](

I read up on that the other day, it does look like a great software.

I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to buy fiat no'mo
They want Bitcoin I'm chopped liver.

You're doing god's work man.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:23:02
That is true, but with lightning we can expect small sums of money like under 50$ and if those get forwarded to a BTC wallet once a day or week or whatever that is an amount of money I could trust to a third party for a short time. That's what I mean by buffering, for the time being I see great potential in that interim solution.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:41:57
Cool concept, I dig the idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:17:20
uh...yes? No? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:43:05
planning to once I figure it all out. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:07:23


Not yet, I will read up on that. Thanks!

yes it doesn't work from mobile so far, you need to set up a real node for yourself. I'm actually not sure if that's intended to change, for the time being you need to run a server / spare computer. I'm no expert myself, hence why I'm asking for a guide :)

Interesting idea, if you could whip up a lightning invoice we could use that for testing, I have some small amount left from ordering a sticker this morning. Help the network and a starving artist at the same time, sounds like a winning combination.

Russian Sleep Experiment creepypasta. If you read up on it gobble up dyatlov path incident along the way, cool reads.

Serious question as a non-animal owner: How does one get a dog into a hoodie, glasses and chain? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:02:24
I think there is great potential for having buffering intermediaries, especially if anyone is free to run a full node if they want to. But having a one-click-Wordpress-plugin and a payment processor would make jumping on the bandwagon that much easier for average-joe and that would give a much wider audience for testing.

Right, I'm an Android user so I'm happy but that definitely has to be released as well.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:00:49
Is that planned already? I have been following LN developement on and off, might have missed that but it sounds perfect. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:07:21
Thanks and cheers right back!
