I think you're looking at this the wrong way. A miner can't say "I'll add every transaction that pays over XX sat/byte in the next block" because they can't predict the demand and there is a real limit on how big the block can be. If demand at that rate suddenly increases 10x they can't necessarily make blocks that are 10x bigger. They are limited by the current technology (bandwidth/latency)


Agreed. Keeping it for this reason is a terrible idea. I don't think this is a major reason that it hasn't changed though.


Me neither, it would be interesting to hear from a miner how blocks are made and if/when they're updated when new (higher fee) transactions are received.

Block space is a scarce resource, even without a hardcoded limit. There are real limits to how big a block can be and I don't believe that will ever be enough to include every possible transaction because possible demand is almost infinite.


I don't think this will ever happen. Miners are going to process the highest fee transactions first, why leave money on the table?
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:37:32


I agree with this.


This is what I think, but I might be wrong so if there's any good research into this I'd love to read it. 


In other words, for any given fee there is a limit to how many transactions are profitable to include in a block. Once the demand at that fee level is higher than that limit you get a backlog. Do you see what I mean? Even without a hardcoded blocksize limit we'll still have these issues.


The thing is that in bitcoin the costs are not just on miners, nodes have to be able to keep up with the blockchain. 
In your analogy the non-mining nodes are like the roads around the Coca-Cola factory. It might be fine for Coca-Cola to increase their traffic 1000x but the roads might not be able to handle it. The cost of upgrading them is not on Coca-Cola but the government who doesn't earn anything from the increase in sales (ignoring taxes because nodes don't earn any of the transaction fees)


You're making the mistake of only considering honest miners, a malicious miner can make as many transactions as they want for free. That's why the argument about how much miners could earn in fee's is irrelevant. You can have huge blocks with no fee's and everyone on the network has to process them.


I don't see what the average blocksize at the time has to do with it. I doubt that was what satoshi considered when he set it.
The limit should be the maximum it can safely be based on current technology.


I'm not trying to argue what the limit should be, just that there is a limit, even if it's not hardcoded in the consensus rules.

Are you saying you believe bitcoin would still work today if miners started making 10gb blocks? 100gb blocks? 
You have to admit there is some limit to how big blocks can be before we start having problems. Once it takes more than 10 minutes to download a block we're in "bitcoin-is-broken" territory.
It's fair to argue about what that limit is, but I can't believe anyone thinks there is no limit.


I don't think there is a set "profitable level" for fees. I think as the block gets bigger the risk of being orphaned gets bigger therefor the fee for additional transactions must be higher to offset that risk.

The 10 minute average (60 minutes sometimes) block time is a huge reason you wouldn't want to use the Blockchain to buy a coffee.

That's an interesting idea I hadn't thought about.
One idea I had that's similar to that is to allow multiple people to pitch in to buy the game. Eg. Game costs 30 euro, Person A calls the bot and sends 10 euro, the bot posts a reply in the thread with the bitcoin address saying it needs 20 euro to complete the order. Then anyone else can put in as much as they want until it reaches the goal and then sends the game. It would have a time limit to refund the payments if it didn't reach the goal. 
I think the idea is pretty good, but I can't currently do it with how the site is setup, maybe in the future.

This is how it currently works but that's what we're proposing to change. Yes, it's more complex then changing one constant but that is not really relevant.
Instead of stating at 50 btc and halving every 210,000 blocks the reward should be controlled by the market. Nodes can set an excessive block reward and an acceptance depth and the market will come to consensus on what the block rewards should be.

I think your example proves that even in best case scenario bitcoin still provides a sub-par experience. No matter how big the block can be, sometimes it can take an hour to find one, that's just one of the limitations of the system. A lot of services (like the one your friend was using) have assessed the risk of accepting 0 confirmation and decided the risk is too high so they force the user to wait (on average 10 minutes) before they can continue.
In terms of user experience, the difference between a 1 hour wait and a 2 hour wait is negligible. User experience degrades exponentially, the first few seconds are so much more important for a good user experience. We need to focus on solutions that are secure within seconds, not minutes or hours. 
The block size has to increase, no doubt about that, but it won't solve the big issues with user experience in situations like your friends. Real solutions to this problem look like lightning transactions, or Dash's InstantX (although I seriously doubt we could get consensus to make such fundamental changes to the core structure of bitcoin). These solutions scale not just the number of users bitcoin can handle but also increases the number of uses bitcoin is suitable for. That's the rocket fuel we need for the moon (mass adoption).

The scenes aren't fake, they are just accepting 0 confirmation transactions. 
This documentary was very misleading as to how bitcoin actually works. The idea that bitcoin is transferred instantly is repeated multiple times and it's just not true. Unconfirmed transactions can not confirm for a number of reasons, both malicious and innocent. Until your transaction is in a block there is very little that is protecting it from being double spent.

When you send Bitcoin you have to send the entire transaction output. 
So it sounds like you had a 0.2 output in your wallet (confirmed for months). You then sent 0.01 of that 0.2, and the remaining 0.19 "change" was sent to a new address. Then, before the first transaction confirmed, you sent the remaining 0.19 which is why you are seeing the warning.

This is a very simplistic view. What is "big"?

21 is trying to develop a bitcoin powered micropayment ecosystem. These are tiny transactions with no fees (because you're not going to pay a $0.02 fee to send someone $0.005). Most miners are not going to add these tiny 0 fee transactions to the blockchain. So by putting miners in their devices and controlling the mining power they are able to ensure that the blocks they find do include these transactions.
Your example cannot create the same ecosystem because your microtransactions will not confirm. Not currently anyway. I suspect in the future when we have better solutions to the micropayment issue (massive block size increase/lightning network etc) but for now this seems to be the only way to build the microtransaction ecosystem 21 is planning.
While I am pretty excited to see this develop, this is not necessarily good for bitcoin. It looks like miners will be forced onto 21's pool. If their products become insanely popular they could control over 50% of the mining power.

Only for transactions that are marked as RBF. If you want your transaction to accepted with 0 confirmations don't make it a RBF transaction. 
If this is not how it has been implemented someone please correct me, but if this is right I don't see the issue.
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:49:19


What you're saying here is that if we trust all the miners, even when they have incentives not to be honest, then 0 confirmation is safe to use. Bitcoins security is not supposed to be based on trust.


This is only an issue if you make your transaction RBF-able, if you want your transaction to be accepted with 0 confirmations don't use RBF. 
Payment processors are currently forced to make a tradeoff between usability and security. This is not a good situation, especially when it may be possible to eat your cake and have it too (ie instant and secure transactions). When there is a "close enough is good enough" method to do something there is less incentive to create a better method. 


It's not possible to have a non-RBF-able transaction because the miners are free to include any valid transaction into a block. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 04:03:49
As far as I understand it this will not break 0 confirmation transactions. Making a transaction RBF-able is optional. If you make a RBF transaction you should not expect it to be accepted with 0 confirmations. If you make a normal transaction it will work just as it does today.
The use case I see for RBF transactions is when you know the receiver will be waiting for confirmations and you don't want to risk having funds stuck in limbo. For example if you were buying a house with bitcoin you would use RBF because the seller will be waiting for 6+ confirmations anyway and you want to be able to increase the fee if your transaction gets stuck.

Who wants some XBL Gold? I will be giving away some 1 month subscriptions randomly in this post.

It's super easy, just reply to the person you want to send it to and make sure you call the bot like so:
1 month
edit: [within 30 seconds the bot will message you to confirm your order and you can begin payment.](
edit2: [Then you select your currency and send payment.]( and once the payment is seen on the network you can [continue to the order review page.](
After 1 confirmation the code is then sent to the user via private message on reddit.

This is a fair point, however BTC deposits are very quick and you can spend instantly so the amount of time you have to trust CoinJar is minimal.
Of course we need a whole bunch of companies offering this service, but I think that will come with time.

Also, unless the car has a flux capacitor it's not being confirmed in block 1887733792.
This seems to be a mock-up for demonstration purposes.
edit: or its not using bitcoin

Sorry, the bot messages the person sending the code to collect payment, the receiver will get their XBL code after 1 confirmation.
You can't use the bot to send the code to anyone else, but it's just a 25 character string of text so you can pass it on however you like.
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:17:33
The codes are either sent as an image or as text. It is possible for us to generate a QR code for the text codes, but we haven't implemented that feature yet.

Yes this is very centralised, but I'm not sure if you can interface with the existing system without points of centralisation like this. 
The CoinJar wallet can be funded with 1 confirmation, so moving money from keys that I do control to the card is not usually a long or difficult process. I can then spent the money instantly and only have to trust coinjar for a short period.

Nope, the codes will work in any country that has Xbox live.

You can't use the bot to send to yourself at the moment but you can buy for yourself on the site

Yes, we're currently close to the cheapest you can buy online. Newegg prices are a bit higher and they only service select countries. The codes are valid worldwide so we sell them worldwide.

Unfortunately Microsoft Points ARE region locked, so we won't be offering them on the site.

It's called Swipe by CoinJar, and it's basically an refillable debit card that can be used anywhere that accepts EFTPOS (Almost everywhere in Australia accepts ETFPOS)
The card is linked to your CoinJar wallet. The balance of the card is in Australian Dollars and I think can be spent instantly after coverting from BTC. Transferring BTC into the coinjar wallet is quick, so you don't have to keep a large amount in this hot wallet, but keeping a small amount here makes it instant to convert BTC-&gt;AUD.
I used it at the local supermarket today and had no issues. There is no NFC/PayPass/Paywave unfortunately, it's a swipe and pin.
As someone who earns some income in BTC I think I will be using this a LOT.
