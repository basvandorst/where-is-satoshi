Why exactly, would the wealth not be centralized - just like it is in every other currency?

But, I don't even know Abram... (Thanks Tim Calhoun SNL)

I love this!!
Comma separate the profit by thousands to make it more easily readable by separating the labels and the values.

Thanks, very nice. Does this contain all data points or are outliers to one or two standard deviations removed?

Nice site!!
I'm also noticing how much different, and positive the comments on this post are compared to those made on A node count would be nice, but for friends and family that are most likely not as knowledgeable about bitcoin, this seems perfect.

Not at all, don't remove it. I was referring to the comment about count vs percentage. The percentage makes more sense for the purpose of this site imo.

If you give me $1 and I give it back to you a year later, it is in reality only $0.97 
You’re forgetting about inflation. It’s taking away the purchasing power of your dollar. 
Now, how about that Bitcoin you were lent you a year ago today?

For even more clarity, as with any prospectus, you should also show the 2,5 and 10 year returns.

FWIW I was able to restore my 1.0 Mycelium backup using  Multibit HD. Hope this helps those who need immediate access to their coin.

“In the long term, don’t put in more than you can afford to lose,”
Same goes for any and every stock out there.
