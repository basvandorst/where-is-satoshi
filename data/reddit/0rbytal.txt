Can any wallpaper creators out there make [this image]( into a bitcoin wallpaper?

No worries. It wouldn't bother me a bit if nobody contributed to that address, because like I said in my comment: I'm not asking/begging for bitcoin.
I'm not scamming anybody, and I'm not asking anyone to trust me. I'm willing to give people my own money (about $3) just to encourage people to use/share bitcoin — regardless of the support I get from this subreddit.
My main goal in this post was to tell people what *I* plan on doing, and hope they do the same (*not* send me bitcoin).

What's the most "visible" way to suggest questions for Joe to ask Andreas &amp; vice versa? I've signed up for the joerogan forum, but I didn't see any thread for "questions for Andreas"... should I start one?
(I'm just hoping to avoid wasted time on ignored posts... I'm hoping if people suggest questions that they'll actually be *read* and considered.)

Call what you want, *Sir* — I do not seek, nor require your approval.
I just came here to share what *I* plan to do (follow the example Andreas' Antonopoulos consistently demonstrates advocating for Bitcoin), and hope that others will do the same.
How does your profession or relationship with the military would any more credence or weight to your opinion, *Sir*?

May your Bitcoin wallet be full until I'm paid

So, what is the moral justification for intentionally devaluing the currency? How the institutional devaluation (through inflation) different than intentional theft of value in those who try to save for the goods/services they want?

It's people like the OP that are going to get people *really* interested in Bitcoin. Just wanted to say: 
Thank You, for being awesome, [TABBYthis]( You friggin' rock!

Despite his crappy AMA &amp; bitterness for Reddit turning out so much more awesome than Digg, I still like Kevin Rose... I remember him from "The Screen Savers" on TechTV and downloading "thebroken" videos
I guess I just always saw him as being a normal dude who made it onto TV. (IMHO) Attack of the Show would have gone a much better direction if Kevin Rose would have stayed and the other (less mature) Kevin would have left...

[As you can see]( he wasn't very responsive, and kinda got reamed for it. His AMA made [the list of worst reddit AMAs](

Here's a technique I advise my friends &amp; family to adopt:
* Get [KeePass]( &amp; KeePassDroid for your phone (not sure if there's one for iPhone(?))
* Sign up for cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, OwnWeb, or run your own with BitTorrentSync) &amp; choose a long, easy-to-remember *for YOU*, but difficult to guess or brute-force, password
* Create a password database in KeePass with a long, convoluted (but easy for YOU to remember) password. 
* Save the database file to the cloud storage folder so that changes to it are automatically synced across all devices AND you can access your password database from anywhere there's an internet connection.
This way, you only have to remember 2 long passwords, because all of your passwords for your other accounts are stored &amp; accessible from KeePass (which allows for a 10-second copy-to-clipboard so you can paste into account login). 
You can make all of your passwords *ridiculously* long and completely random, and you don't ever have to remember any of them! And your passwords are accessible anywhere you have internet access and/or your phone.
