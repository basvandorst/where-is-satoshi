Uhm... what's stopping me from a pump &amp; dump? Let's say I pretend to have insider knowledge, buy up a few shares on a very controversial (49:51) issue. When the ratio gets to 55:45, the public realizes there's insider information and starts dumping the other option. At 80:20, I sell all my shares again. Because my shares now are only a small fraction of the majority, the ratio hardly even changes and I'm out with a net win without any risk.

Satoshi is probably using paper wallets. Being pieces of paper, it's impossible to hack them. They can be physically stolen, so I guess he stores them in a safe or bank locker.

For the purposes of this question, you can subsitute BTC with EUR. Someone sells you 75€ for $100. Now this person has less EUR and more USD. It was still a meaningful transaction that weakened the US economy by a tiny bit. Why?
Let's say you decide to spend the 75€ in Europe - for example, to buy wine in France. You won't spend your $100 to buy wine from California. So the French winery (and, by extension, the European economy) profits from your money.
Now to come back to the original question: BTC doesn't belong to any one country. But people are being paid in BTC, and people are buying food, cars and houses in BTC. So we have a parallel BTC economy, similar to the EUR economy. When you decide to pay something in BTC, you decide against paying in USD. This transaction is "lost" for the USD economy.
This decision has the same consequences for everybody - for you, and the person who sold you BTC. Ultimately, even for the miner who originally found and sold this BTC. And since even the miner can use their BTC to buy graphics cards and electricity, we have a working circular economy.

All alt-fiats are more or less strongly limited in their effective region, so they're somewhat hard to trade compared to cryptocurrencies. Liberty Dollar - with potential buyers from the whole US - could have had one of the biggest market caps. [Wikipedia]( mentions that the founder had to return $7M in coins to the state. Unless there was some fractional reserve banking involved, this was the market cap for the Liberty Dollar in 2011.
Other alt-fiats like the Brixton Pound or the [Chiemgauer]( are even more locally restricted, and must be even smaller than that.
The biggest alt-fiat I could find is the currency by the Swiss [WIR-Bank]( It's not obviously a currency, because it doesn't have an official symbol or exchange rate, but it's exchanged separately from the national CHF, and it's backed by 3 billion CHF. Still smaller than Bitcoin.

You reduce every transaction to zero-sum games, which is a bit oversimplified: there is a time aspect.
But even when we disregard that, you can't avoid the discussion about the origin of money.
BTC is created by the blockchain, and given out equivalently to people with the most hashing power.
Fiat is currently mostly created by commercial banks (by [fractional reserve banking]( and given out to bank executives, investors and the state (via taxes). Central banks have stopped playing this role a couple of decades ago.
When you use $100 to buy BTC, banks have $100 less cash to back their investments, so the fractional reserve ratio increases a bit. Higher ratios are more risky, so bankers will reduce their investments by $1000 (assuming a conservative ratio of 10:1) to compensate. Essentially, by withdrawing $100, you have prevented the creation of $900 that would have been used for the national economy.
On the other side, your $100 essentially end up at the miner who found the winning block containing the equivalent 0.3BTC. This miner has made a choice to buy their hashing power (electricity + gear) in BTC or in USD. If they bought their equipment in USD, the $100 end up on some company bank account and are used for fractional reserve banking. But if they decided to buy their mining equipment in BTC, the $900 stay permanently out the US economy.
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:19:11
I think the daily limit to 1000€ is a crappy compromise between convenience and safety. It's optional for me. But sometimes I need to transfer more, and I never make it during the bank's regular opening times.
Also, I'm pretty sure my bank doesn't charge back fradulent wire transfers.
Then again, my bank account is free. Bitcoin definitely can't compete with that, at least not yet.
But if someone steals your BIP-encrypted paper wallet, you're not "perma-fucked". It's just time to get your backup wallet and transfer your money to a new one. You have a few weeks of time until they crack your password.
Oh, and no need for fire-proof safes or safe deposity boxes. Just keep a backup wallet in a sealed envelope at each place you are regularly, and check the seals occasionally.
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:55:20
More like: I don't get paid for providing a fully-fledged server that requires a considerable amount of electricity, storage, maintenance and bandwidth?
I think that question is quite reasonable, at least with a long-term perspective. Nowadays, only miners (and mining pools) have an incentive to provide full nodes. It wasn't intended that way, and maybe this issue needs to be solved by incentivizing non-miners as well.

And even if the client software used checksums to secure the drive space with encryption and checksums and what not, it's still be possible to change the outgoing packets to other peering partners with fake values.

I'm willing to accept that. ASICs plus an exponential difficulty curve have lead to a strong centralization. I'm expecting this trend to continue for the next two years (while the reward is still 25BTC per block). After that, it's still up to speculation what will happen.

It's "just" 0.6BTC, so haven't put a ton of effort into my cracking attempts. The core of BIP38 brute-force attacks is, of course, the wallet encryption algorithm.

But it seems that the core algorithm at walletrecovery.com is not open-source. 20% finder's fee on the other hand seems OK; I might try that.
I've developed a suspicion that the website that originally created my encrypted wallet got the BIP-38 implementation wrong. After all, it was only in alpha when I did it. Do you think that's possible?

If the unpopularity happens gradually, difficulty would simply sink again. If it happens quickly, the next block would be postponed until the developers realize this and bring out an updated client with a much lower initial difficulty. Any way, the network would work like before.

You need to take the currently stored oil in relation to global demand. The amount of tankers on the open sea may seem much, but the global demand is much, much higher than that. I doubt that the oil on these ships would be kept unburnt for much more than a week if it was actually for sale.
So much for the short-term view.
Mid-term perspective: we have two scenarios.
First, the textbook theory. It assumes that demand is somewhat constant, and that it will meet with supply curve at, for example, $28 per barrel. Because the supply curve has a lot of momentum (it can't stop going down quickly), demand will quickly surpass supply, leading to extremely (x10) high oil prices in the short term. That's the event that the oil companies have been waiting for during the entirety of 2015. It would mean very high gas prices and shortages for the consumer.
Second, the alternative scenario: For some reason, demand keeps sinking together with supply. Then oil prices will stay low for a very long time, completely bankrupting oil companies and oil-export-dependent nations. This is the worst-case scenario that the experts fear. For the consumer, it means that he can't afford gas even at low prices (for example, due to unemployment, or because the national currency is in hyperinflation).
Now, the question is only in which scenario we are in right now. And the longer the oil price drop continues, the more likely we're in the second one.

The Brexit is predicted to weigh on the European stock market for weeks to come. That means that the Euro will devalue. Investors have already started exiting the Euro two weeks ago, because - like you mentioned - these things take time. A bitcoin-savvy investor would have transfered her ~5% of Euro to an exchange already and will be waiting for the friday 3 AM referendum results. If there will be a brexit, she'll convert her Euro to Bitcoin. If not, she'll withdraw her money again.
And if she's not that comfortable with the manic buying phase after 3AM, she'll start buying a short time before the event already. If the brexit doesn't come, she needs to pay double fees, but that may be worth it, compared to the possible price hike.

Good point - that actually reduced my thought "If it's so important, why is there no incentive?" to "So running a full node is practically a hardware donation to support the Bitcoin initiative".
I have three issues with that:
* Everything else in Bitcoin is properly incentivized, which makes it self-regulating. Why not this as well? Bitcoin was built explicitly to work in a no-trust environment with purely self interested actors. This detail violates the rule.
* The current number of nodes is nowhere near ideal. It's the absolute bare minimum, run by altruistic people. The number already declines over time, and there is no clear threshold that says "this is definitely too few nodes".
* Despite the number of nodes being critical for the network, there is no effective regulation mechanism for increasing it if it becomes critically low.
From what I've read, most people think they can sit out the discussion until the number of nodes is critically low - then the devs are forced to act. Guess I'll get a seat then as well.

If you're daytrading, staring at charts is essentially equal to staring at a slot machine. And if you're not, you're just wasting brain capacity. If you really want to predict the price, get into machine learning and start coding instead.

We're at 0.1 million transactions today, twice as much as it was two years ago.

Advice? Uhm...
Make yourself comfortable with all the **software**. Desktop clients, online wallets, smartphone apps, paper wallets - you will have to use them sooner or later, and it's better to be familiar with the pitfalls *before* you store larger amounts of money in Bitcoin. Almost every mistake means that your money gets stolen or is lost forever. This is very scary in the beginning, and you should start with very small amounts because of that.
Ask for **bitcoin support** wherever you pay something. Almost everyone here agrees that it's better for transactions than bank transfers, but almost nobody in the real world knows that. As soon as enough people ask "Can I pay that with Bitcoin?" they'll have to look it up and can discover the benefits. (Oh, and have enough BTC on your phone to actually pay what you asked for).
If the strong day-to-day price changes should seduce you towards **gambling** ("trading"), there's a few basic rules:
* Don't EVER buy more bitcoins than you can afford
* Don't buy so many bitcoins that you get into trouble if you lose half of them
* As long as you're a beginner: Buy when everyone's buying, sell when everyone's selling - trying to outsmart everybody just leads to more loss for you. There are few especially good times when to buy and when to sell, and most people know about them.

If you think **mining** sounds interesting, you should look into alternatives to Bitcoin (like Litecoin). Bitcoin mining is currently dominated by expensive specialized computing hardware, but you could still earn a few alternative coins on your existing graphics card.

Yes, I read the original literature. Yes, a digital deflationary decentralized currency/asset is interesting. Yes, it's slightly better an asset than gold. But its price is just an indicator of the adoption rate, nothing that didn't happen before with other technology.
I think that *global*, not local economics are where Bitcoin will be transformative, and that this could have drastic geopolitic implications.
I'm also trying to tell you that *other uses* for the blockchain may be even more radical than Bitcoin.

I don't see the reason for any rational buyer to spend more money than they have to. Merchants have a small motivation because they need to pay a fee to BitPay, which exists because of risk from volatility. BitPay relies on the stability of exchanges. And exchanges in turn become more or less stable with their trading fees.
Last weekend was a good example on what creates stability and what doesn't, because MtGox introduced a 0% trading fee. Compared to the weekends before, the market went batshit insane.
Therefore, it's easy to see a way for the price to stabilize:
* A competitor to BitPay opens, let's call it CoinPay.
* CoinPay makes a deal with Bitstamp to get more stable exchange prizes in exchange for an initial fee (or by explaining the following business proposal).
* Bitstamp introduces a flexible trading fee coupled to the age of the coins (since the last transaction on Bitstamp or the blockchain). Exchanging coins older than 15 days costs 0.05%. Fees increase with frequency, so that serious high-frequency transactions cost over 20%.
* People who use bitcoins as a currency flock towards Bitstamp because their exchange is the cheapest.
* Daytraders leave Bitstamp altogether; long-term investors stay there.
* Bitstamp enjoys the benefits from being the largest exchange on the market
* CoinPay offers Bitcoin payment for *much* lower fees than BitPay
* ...the price is stable and everybody wins. Except for BitPay.

MasterCard and Visa are companies which compete by using the same technology. Bitcoin and Litecoin are two different technologies which do similar things. The difference is that there's no competition, only a better system which will "win" in the long term.

You're confusing the order book with the real market depth. I don't have standing orders for everything in my exchange account - do you?
Yes, if the thief was the only trader on the market, it would be possible to buy all the dollars that MtGox has to offer. But as soon as the price dropped below $500, the thief would encounter heavy resistance from new money sweeping in to buy cheap coins.
And of course MtGox isn't the only exchange, so the chinese market would start buying as well to profit from arbitrage.
So, realistically, even in the unlikely event they cashed out everything at once (good luck with not being detected by the authorities for that), the price wouldn't drop far below $300, and that not even for long.

That's an agressive stance, and I doubt it.
I used the Bitcoin wave to get into the fundamentals of finance, and I'm sure plenty of other Redditors are eager to learn as well.
On the other hand, professional traders aren't that idealistic as most people on this subreddit. They don't have any trouble to run Bitcoin into the ground if it means profit for them. So, when the price eventually stabilizes, it will be caused by increased mainstream adaption, not by day traders.

5 years ago, it was **really** hard to know about Bitcoin. I learned about it on Reddit in 2011. I'm very enthusiastic about new technology and I had lots of free time to read up about it, so I mined for a while (on existing hardware only).
Compared to today, the mood in the forums was completely different. Lots of negativity, ignorance and insecurity. Most of the discussions were about hardware. There was (practically) only MtGox as exchange, which was a pain in the ass, and no way to spend any bitcoins anywhere. It was a purely speculative currency, with a badly volatile market and without any visible long-term upwards trend, Oh, and every week there was an alternative project that claimed they would fix the issues with Bitcoin. Litcoin, Ripple etc. - a few of them are still out there.
With all the negativity, I didn't even know if it was worth the cost of electricity, so I stopped mining after 5 days. But I followed the scene closely, using my existing bitcoins as motivation.
If you are really sorry that you didn't invest 2 years ago, *do it now*. The signs are lookimg better than ever, and certainly better than in 2011. And the price isn't nearly high enough yet to count as mainstream.

Interesting point! In fact, there have already been a couple of interfering strategies in effect during the last few weeks:
* Decreasing price differences between exchanges by putting up large sell walls on MtGox
* Deliberately crossing the $1000 mark with a single, 1500BTC buy
* Trying to crash the market with repeated big sales and buys during the last weekend
And when you think of the budgets of governmental sectors, they could very well provide a stabilizing influence on the market - but it would cost them big $$$ each time.

You're not too late. But you need to realize that in order to get some interesting gains, the Bitcoin exchange price needs to rise another 30-fold - which could take several years or even decades. It's also quite likely that everybody switches to some new coin by then and Bitcoin become worthless.
All these success stories we hear are based on people who forgot about their stash and didn't lose it accidentally in the meantime. Do you have enough willpower to care for this slowly growing heap of money in the meantime, while always resisting spending some of it?

Paper wallets aren't risk-free either. Thefts are actually easier for people with access to your room, because paper isn't encrypted right now. With every backup you increase your theft risk. But you need backups, or you're very vulnerable to natural disasters, accidents and human error.
So, mobile phone systems may not become completely exploit-free, but they could eventually get down to the same risk level of paper wallets, because that's much greater than zero.

That may be true when you describe the current implementations of mobile wallets, but in principle mobile wallets *could* be just as safe as private keys printed on paper. This is what we, as a community, need to aim for if we want to get adopted by the mainstream.
Online wallets should become safer too (because they're going to be used and the woes will be big when they fail), but that's not just a technical problem and harder to solve right now.
And visionary aspects aside, yes, we should definitely advocate for paper wallets as the main storage option right now. It would be just nice if it didn't have to be that way.

You use a log graph *precisely* to put different price jumps in relation to one another. A 20% spike will look exactly as big at a price of $10 as at a price of $1200.

The intrinsic value of a Bitcoin comes from:
* The ability to trade money globally, with an extremely small fee
* The power to circumvent local trade restrictions
* The increased amount of personal control (harder to seize or influence by the government)
* The increased price stability (in the mid-term future), simply because global currencies are less affected by national issues than national currencies.

Of course it works for generic purchases. For example, you want to buy christmas presents every year. Even if you could wait with your purchases to the very last second, you have a maximal time flexibility of 12 months.
Why do people buy new cars or new homes? Certainly not only because they want them, but because they *need* them. Yes, major purchases can be postponed by a few months or even years, but at some point the monetary gains can't be excused by the pressure created by ignoring those needs.
Especially since these monetary gains will be **drastically** lower than 100% per week from the current bull run.

Bitcoin is innovative in two ways:
* It's a global, unregulated digital currency
* It's a decentralized deterministic tracking tool without requiring trust
The currency's price is just a part of  and not even a very interesting part. For example, most national wars have historically also been wars between currencies. I'm curious if war efforts would be decreased when both countries have major assets in Bitcoin.
And why  may be interesting? It solves the problem of synchronizing thousands of accountants across multiple stores. It was the last step to make secure online voting possible. And I'm sure this is just the very beginning of innovations.
