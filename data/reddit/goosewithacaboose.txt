This isn’t like driving a car man, or fixing a pipe where general thoughts and advice are ***actually*** general thoughts and advice. 
Right now, no one has had any success finding real indicators. No one has any general thoughts or general advice beyond the riskiness of investing and the insane financial phenomenon that Bitcoin has turned into. 
You want to “know” what to do? Ask yourself, what do I value most? Do I value the high reward that tempted me in the first place more? Or do I value my desire to stay safe and expose myself to minimal risk more?
This is why I came in hot. You’re looking at the wrong places for advice amigo. What you seek, the ones who may have a good idea won’t (can’t) speak of, and the ones who will ramble on and on about what you *should* do end up filling the space of knowledge. They don’t know. No ones knows. With that in mind, what do you want to do? It’s most likely (if I HAD to bet I’d bet on this) never going to grow in the insane way it grew again. It just probably won’t. But do I know? No. It hit 20k two weeks before I believed it would (though it couldn’t stay, obviously). 
Good luck man. Take a look at other crypto’s too.

Any examples or evidence of this? Hearsay can sound very riveting. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:08:47
Sure, and that premise maybe correct anecdotally, but it wouldn’t remotely be considered as something worth considering. By that same conjecture I can write off every fucking person and non profit. Doesn’t do any good man, and it is delusional. Lack of evidence doesn’t mean lack of crime but lack of evidence certainly doesn’t mean crime (especially if your lack of evidence is filled in by your opinions/beliefs)

Idk I didn’t like the tone of the whole article. He seems like a presumptuous fuck who thinks he knows of hidden facts. 


Who is saying that? No it’s not.


Transactionally? Sure. To hold as an asset hoping it’s value remains the same? Obviously not. 


Ok, this one is just utter horse shit. Yeah, it’s not a centralized currency backed by a nation or commodity, but we give so much shit value that money isn’t even money. But I guess, some people might not realize this. 


This guy is dumb as shit. BTC intrinsic value comes from what it is: the tech that makes it a cryptocurrency. Unfortunately no one knows how to quantify that. 


Well, since we don’t know the intrinsic value we can’t determine if it’s in a bubble but it does seem like it’s in a mania, but that could just lead to new highs being the new questionable values    


Pretty self explanatory. This guy is stupid, of course people hold onto what made them money! 


I wish I hadn’t read this trash
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:10:09
I guess we will agree to disagree because you’re coming in hot as if you know jack, but honestly you don’t know shit. It is the same garbage argument made about currencies. Even when they were backed by a metal, those metals had no intrinsic value. Those metals may be used for other purposes, but gold was never the metal of choice because of its conductivity. We don’t build things with superior function because they have gold. Silver and Copper are far better conductors. 
Intrinsic value is something you dimwittedly thing exists even in centralized currencies, yet since the dawn of time any currency or placeholder of value has only had the “intrinsic value” people assigned it. From beads to salt to pepper and other things have been used as currency.

Fuck this HODL meme. Peoples money and lives isn’t a meme ( I guess) 
Quit being a bitch and do what the fuck you want. No one ***knows**** anything. 
It could be $20k tomorrow and $50k in a month or 12k tomorrow and 2k in a month. 
Both are possible. Lots of speculation. Guess what? This sub reads speculations. Watches with their own experience but it’s all subjective. 
Make a decision for yourself. These aren’t experts. And if they are, they wouldn’t waste their time responding to someone tripping out over a little fly of a scare in investing. 
***especially since you’re still positive. Amateur.***
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:34:15
Let’s be real man. This isn’t a stock that has limit orders execute almost every time. This isn’t something that one can even get in and out of at certain price points. The exchanges keep crashing.
BTC won’t make you much noticeable money if you’re making day trades under $10k. 10k+ it’s easy to get a $1k gain from trading and it is noticeable, and less isn’t worth the stress for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:53
I’m sorry! It was beautiful art. I am too pessimistic.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:00
I know but look at the rest of the comments you got. If I hadn’t seen so many HODL’s I wouldn’t have even felt annoyed enough to comment. It’s like when someone reposts something that isn’t theirs and reaps karma. Few people have authentic thoughts, creative and their own. We mostly echo the beliefs we took on. 
I would honestly say this: 
1) BTC is either gonna surge to unprecedented numbers in the next week or tank even more, can’t say which I feel will happen more because honestly, I don’t want to falsely deceive anyone with my subjective point of view 
2) Litecoin is doing some funny things, if I was in it I would’ve sold by now, but, I would’ve sold at $140 so I would’ve missed the $12 and change more it’s at. 
3) ethereum is really cool, idk a ton about it (there are experts out there) but I would observe it and hold unless you see some crazy shit happening.l
4) investing is crazy my man. It’s a gamble. A genuine gamble because we don’t know what causes what outcomes. A dice is random because each side is just as likely. If you weight one side, it’s not so random, but crypto is like a more complex more variable dice. 
5) think realistically. If you see yourself thinking in emotions—the emotion of making $$$$$, the feeling of crushing it, the feeling of losing all my money and having had warning signs but ignored them, the feeling of blah blah. 
They’re feelings. They’re real, but not reality. 
Sorry I came in hot. Our society has so much fluff where substance should be. Don’t get lost out there. ;-)

Lmao I would love to put this on You’re the biggest fool ever. You don’t know the meaning of intrinsic, probably are *actually* a teenager, and trying so hard to appear smart. 
I don’t need this shit. Google gold. It’s 30% less conductive than pure silver. So when you say it’s almost the same, you’re absolutely an idiot. You don’t have a masters, you have hate towards bitcoin and the things you don’t understand. 
Sad, really. Hope you learn some shit. 
Also, on the Internet, you only look like a little bitch when you try to flex. Your info is wrong, so you desperately try to insult your way out, and talk about some degree you don’t have because the info you supposedly learned is wrong. 
I’m done. You’re factually incorrect and have the audacity to pose as correct. Gold didn’t have intrinsic value and it still doesn’t. We assigned it one, like you assigned your pillow fuck toy a personality. It doesn’t have one, but you as a creature with imagination can assign it one. Later dude. Goodluck you angry little shit
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:13:26
I didn’t get banned. Cursing? What are you? 80? 
You don’t have a physics degree because you don’t know what conductivity is, and you said gold and silver are pretty much the same when one being 30% weaker is actually a rather large difference. 
You’re using my Reddit account join date to determine how much I know? You fool. This is an alt. 
Kinda crazy that you don’t actually have any degree in physics and will lie, then jump back and forth between different “things you do”.

Small amount? If you’re day trading under $10k it’s not worth it imho. If you don’t have $10k laying around for risky bidness then don’t day trade. This shit ain’t no joke.

Intrinsic value of bitcoin would be nothing if it were simply another currency in the current system. It’s not. It’s a new network and new means of interacting with currencies. Decentralized, secure transactions, faster transactions, the ability to remain anonymous (though this is becoming more and more challenging). These give it a value that the currencies we’ve used up to now (national/commodity backed/centralized in the authority of one entity) don’t have. 
It has an intrinsic value. How to quantify it is the question.

Is this a joke? As in, hobos are peer to peer because they ask for change? Or are you thinking I meant national currencies have technological value intrinsically? I was saying cryptocurrencies have intrinsic value that centralized currencies (the nickel...) don’t.

I’m just teasing, I think. Idk why people advertise products on Reddit without actually being good at it. “Got this HODL shirt” would’ve worked way better than look what I’m selling in a sub if probably many without dispensable cash
