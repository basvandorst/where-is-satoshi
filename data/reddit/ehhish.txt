A good portion of USD carries no intrinsic value as it is no longer backed fully by the treasury.

Are we supposed to get paid? I learned a lot of stuff in this post.

I think you are misunderstanding. How does the military make a piece of paper with 1$ printed on it worth something I can exchange with? Bitcoin, visa cards, fiat, etc. are all the same. It's something declared by a government entity to be legal tender, except in the case of Bitcoin and other currencies of the type, is that it is decentralized, which means the people decide what it's worth rather than the government. It takes power and control out of government hands.

I think your last statement is the point it gets down to. The only value any currency has is what people are willing to pay for it or accept.  I think this day and age, people are becoming more distrusting of the government, regulation has weakened tremendously. A global currency isn't the worst of ideas. I could see a crypto currency that becomes comparable to visa in the future.  (Don't forget there is a beginning to everything, visa wasn't always known, accepted, or recognized at one point)

Compare Bitcoin to USD on what makes it worth anything. How is a piece of paper or a few numbers in a computer at a bank (your bank account) worth anything? What is the USD represent? What is it backed by?
