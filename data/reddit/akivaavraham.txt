What assertion?


What about just having a greater control of their exchange? In this way, could they not implement a functionality or property that would help prevent pumps and dumps?

I disagree with this point in the article.


Bitcoin's value, unlike gold, is highly volatile to political action, because its value is dependent largely on the free flow between countries and individuals. I suspect when legislation catches up with it, its value will start to kilter off. Gold, even if you ban it, still retains the properties of the metal, and a more or less intrinsic aesthetic value. Thus when one wishes to hedge against inflation, Gold is a safer bet than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is certainly valuable, but it is far from being something like Gold.
I also do not understand how Stock, unlike Gold, must have a central point of failure. Perhaps I am not considering something here?

Could you not just have it so that the selling of your stocks would happen gradually? Say, you could only sell or buy 10 percent of your total existing stock in a day? They have done this with fractional reserve banking to some extent, although underhandedly at the time, and it seemed to have accomplished that goal.

I think perhaps a work around there could be in order to get an encryption key, in which you could decrypt your own data or to initiate your service, that it could be either a subscription model (Similar to how mining websites ding you to maintain their servers or website or whatever.), a minimum purchase or collateral system reducing the potential amount of double accounts, or perhaps a limit on users altogether, thus making an account a valued asset.
What do you think?

Where am I regulating? This is merely the company setting its own technology, much like how bitcoin sets an arbitrary limit on the amount of coin that can be mined.

I very much doubt it too. Bitcoin is young, and my guess it that people will only take pause on it when some sort of government regulation causes its value to plunge.

Its exactly the same as real corn, except moreso! It is Corn 2.0!

Why isn't it an improvement?

Fair enough. Not being a cryptologist, I will take your word for it. Are there any crypto attributes that could be applied to a stock based coin, that would give it value?
For my own part, when I look at people having bitcoin, I regard it as people having stock in that entity, "Bitcoin". If a Multi National Company started its own crypto stock, say Canadian Tire for example, could it not achieve relatively the same concept?

Could you have all the transactions tracked by their servers, but have the transaction data encrypted?

I always think analogies fail with Bitcoin.
At one point, he describes mining as if its like putting together a puzzle, and soon a picture is formed which gives it value. But that indicates some sort of intrinsic aesthetic property; bitcoin has no intrinsic anything.

Thanks; I did not see that.

I hate double negatives.
Well one reason could be just to avoid the conventional exchanges, and perhaps setting up their own; From what I understand, a lot of companies are trying to move away from the exchanges, although I can't remember the exact reasoning.
