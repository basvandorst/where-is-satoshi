It just seems like this video only shows the ltn transaction but doesn't show whatever setup was required.

The way you are describing the network makes it sound like every node is equal which is not the case. Nodes that have more money tied up can support larger transactions, and the more nodes you need to route through, the more you will need to pay in fees for each transaction. It seems to me that there is a good incentive to connect to a large hub with transaction bandwidth to handle larger transactions and also reduce the hops necessary to reach whoever you are paying.

I understand, what's the correct nomenclature for a very well connected node then? To improve user experience, it seems like you want to be connected to a well connected node so that you are more likely to be able to route to whoever you are paying without opening a new channel.

Thanks for the info!

If the fees don't even cover the power of a raspi then the only way to run a ltn node profitably is to do so at massive scale. Seems like a strong incentive to centralize. How does the multi-channel routing work? Would you need to split up the payment into two smaller payments? Is that automated?

In this video, did the user need to open a channel with the coffee shop first or was it routed through a hub?

Wow, look at this high roller with his Lamborghini branded legos sets. 
And me over here, with my Megablocks generic car set.

Agreed, just strengthening the BTC immune system.

Can you imagine what would happen to the market if Satoshi started moving their coins?

Simplified Payment Verification. It's how BTC light wallets are able to verify blockchain transactions without downloading the entire blockchain.
