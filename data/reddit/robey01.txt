They actually contemplated making google bucks back in 2011. Would have been similar to what QQ did in china, i would have guessed.

My Grandpa is 95 and working a pc for him is no problem. Is it so hard to believe?

Oh no, you should have bought at X now it is at Y. Just think you could have paid off Z.

You know, I think there are a multitude of learning opportunities here:
1) DIY Raspberry Pi: $35
2) 4gb SD Card: $10
3) A few USB ASIC Miners: $35-40
4) Powered USB hub: $15
Optional but nice to haves:
5) Case: $5-10
6) wifi usb $10
7) wireless keyboard/mouse: $20
8) video cable (if you're not ssh into it) hdmi or RCA
9) audio cable (for media use if not mining)
Now the family is in the bitcoin game for ~$100-$150. It will never pay off, but by the time they turn 18 have a head start for very little investment, and maybe it will offset those transaction costs after mining has been completed.
Your parents will see the physical assets so the investment isn't so risky, they can always ebay it they'll say.
A great bonding/learning opportunity can come from building a bitcoin miner with your parents.
My dad is 60 with sever Parkinson's (some kind of rare form of aggressive version), I did put one of these kits together with him just to spend time with him and make him feel like a part of my interests. He was so interested, and just spending time with him doing an activity he could still do, i could tell, meant so much to him. I've never cried over his condition, and I don't know, maybe it is progression and his rapidly declining state that caused me to lose it.
I kicked my own ass over not getting in on Bitcoin two years ago, but the experience I just shared with my own father will be worth a lifetime and no profiteering could have ever afforded that...

We can go to the looney bin together!

This too happened to me, I just had them call instead.

Raspberry Pies?
What is that amazing usb tray you are using to connect them?

If this were animated so the chart moves downward like an escalator and bitcoin man is perpetually trying to walk up. I think that would be a fitting gif. :)

No, my rigs have already paid for themselves. You could say the one I put together with my dad was paid for with house money.
Obviously you missed the underlying point of my post. I didn't know bit coining mining rigs have become the geek equivalent to a rednecks jacked up f 150 as a means to compensate for the little man.

maybe both or neither, but one or the other.

I agree, they aren't RPIs.
However, I did find the answer to the usb hub, [Anker 9-port powered 3.0 usb hub](

Doesn't make sense. I see no mention of dogecoin and it was downvoted? This is suspicious activity indeed...

It's 25 dollars if you run it as credit, no signature is required. This is a fairly recent change adopted by the credit card processing companies. I want to say, Casey's Convenience stores also follow this practice.
In my opinion, this change in practice probably stemmed from a financial study using methodology similar to those used in the [fight club auto recall scenario]( where insurance and auto companies determine the validity of the recall based only on financial outcomes and no value to loss of life (or in this case, your credit scores, assets, and identity).
