Left brain right brain is disproven. Has been for some time.

I actually found it incredibly odd when they said this as China is currently trying to replace the Dollar with the Yuan as the global reserve.

Are you aware of the difference between US and EU definitions of Libertarianism. The EU definition is left wing and the earlier by quite a long time.

This is pretty bad news BoE is the UK equivalent of the Federal Reserve in America
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:39:16
The owner ship is technically different but they offer the same function and ultimate the BoE responds to elites and not the public.

It would be nice but the fact that he's being looked into by federal agents for insider trading (I think that's what it was but whatever it was it was done really stupidly so the people getting ripped off could tell). I think it rings more true that he's just really short sighted and entightled.

The world and the economies within it do not exist in a vacuum. To fully understand what is happening within you cannot presuppose that something can happen without influence and as such I was making the point that Chile now and a alternate universes Chile which did not turn to free market thesis is a the only way you could frame your previous question without being ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:50:08
that's not a resonable point to make, as without the US pushing 'free markets' on countries many would be much more well developed, prime examples of this are Japan and South Korea who chose to spend heavily on state education and research i.e.universities (this is where real growth comes from as technology is the most valuable trade goods) countries told that the free market are the way to go are durastically worse off than those that have pushed high taxes to afford good universities.

I'm fairly well aware there are many areas of life that i have been indoctrinated on, however I can assure you after having been told constantly that marxism is completely useless I actually decided to read into it and to look at the countries where it had been implemented of which it turns out there are none more than a few policies with Cuba using the most and Cobane in Seria being the only other even close (which is not a country but a City). Now among other things I discovered was that even US presidents have attimited in closed talks that Cuba was far more sucessful than they could have ever expected and that if this became common knowledge it would 'destablise some of the biggest companies in the country'. However if you're going to refuse to believe me I highly recommend to have a read at Wikileaks or the intercept or even through the records of the CIA or other previously top secret documents that have since been disclosed. These topics are actually spoken about quite candidly and most of the time it was known by the people there that free market capitalism is supposed to make the rich richer without any benefit to the poor.

The Miracle of Chile did not help it's people only the very rich and really it was enstated for the US's gain it. Like pretty muchh every cases of 'democracy' being instated where the US found gain existed it was not true democracy if they chose to vote against US interest they would have been (at least attempted) overthrown, as was the case in Nicargua. The fact that the CIA were involved in the stratergy should have immediately shown you that the wikipedia article at the very least would tell a biased story and ontop of this if you believe that anytime the CIA is involved with something in another country that what has happened is good you are gravely wrong. This this thread shows a startling lack of knowledge in the history of these type of situations and I'm assuming doesn't realise that Cuba the worlds only true socialist state has had the most stable economy in the world for a very long time, even with the presence of extreme economic pressure from the US. If you actually feel like trying to understand the world you inhabit I suggest you read Naomi Klein and maybe Naom Chomsky too for further depth.

No I'm not and I have to assume you live in the US to not know these things. ever since you spoke the pledge of allegiance you've been indoctrinated.

Indoctrination is not blanket you can be indoctrinated on one thing and not another.

Fairly sure he isn't a libertarian, which in itself is a childish position to hold libertarianism is one of the most easily disproved thesis in existence James Madison realised it wouldn't work only 2 years after the consitution was signed(although it didn't have a name then).

Sorry just fed up of misinformation being spread around by people who have no idea of what they are talking about.

Is that the best reply you can come up with are you that indoctrinated?
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:35:57
One of the world's best healthcare standards in the world certainly ranked way above the US and the highest social mobility in the world certainly make Cuba more wholesome than the US. Say what you like about socialism and states (to things I do not think are necessary in the long run I believe ultimately we must move to direct democracy which by the nature of ulitarian equillibrium will lead to taxes and social fundings for schools/healthcare etc) but as a barrier against wanton greed they are the best tried method that exists.

"Would you rather be in Chile now or in Chile 30 years ago?" No I'm not it is you that has done that you can't just attempt to turn an argument to your favour by saying no you are, quite frankly that's the stupidest thing I've heard in an argument in a while and I've watched debates with Alan Dershowitz. 
Anyhow if we're to look at societies with socialism compared to those without there is only Cuba, the most stable state in the world despite having humungous pressure from the US, whereas you can look at every state that has taken the advice of people like Friedman nearly all are in frieghtningly impoverished or altogether failed. This is what you see all over Africa (something that hard line right wingers just ignore blaming it on either incompetence or lack of resources neither of which are true, but the blanket racism that exist on the west hides this) though where there has been a pull against this type of system Kenya for example their economy has started to stablise and poverty has gone down.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:37:44
You can only see what your media lets you to an observant outsider you can see there are advantages to both, though the US has been since the second world war on the down economically and in it's gotten expontially worse with every right wing administration yes it has been on the down with the left but not nearly as badly until the rise of neo-conservatism/liberalism brought by Raegon and Thatcher. 
I don't sing Cuba's praises I use it as a counter point to the US's propaganda and it is by far the most obvious example of it even with the US's extreme actions against it many of which you will likely have no idea of it manages to remain stable and it's people safe violence in Cuba is dwarfed by that of the US in fact the US has some of the highest violent crime rates of any country despite it's place as the richest country to have ever existed. 
However if you want to ignore Cuba there is also throughout the world but most notably in Europe better standards of living in every country (relative to their area of the world) who has more left wing policies the scandinavian are a prime example of this, with swedens move to the right even with US backing they are falling behind their neighbours in Denmark, Iceland and Norway. America remains the richest country not because of it's sound economic policy(/s) but because of it's foreign policy so strongly pushing against over potential countries, and more importantly because it was rich before, the US owned 50% of the worlds wealth in 1940 now it is closer to 20%.
