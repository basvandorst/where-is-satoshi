good article...great person
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:50:26
hilarious....and so true  ;)
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:32:50
thats the one thing that gets me...i cant send $ back from the card as btc...really inefficient in that regard.
other than that i love everything you guys are doing/ave done...keep it up ;)
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:21:59
first everyone is freaking out cuz of the backlog and the potential time it'd take for a tx to go through....
now every1 is freaking out cuz there are TOO FEW tx's???
it's called basic supply and demand....check a couple xchanges volume levels.
bitcoin is fine...every1 calm down
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:55:08
i hear ya...and every1 else as well. i just had my longest transaction ever...13 hrs for $50 trans. i said screw it and raised the fee on the deal, and WOLLA! it went through within the next 30-40 min....
coincidence? i think not...
bottom line - its segwit time...and hard forks are dangerous (plus they hurt when i eat..lol  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:38:16
exactly...i could give 2 shits about them now...
am giving 1 star and uninstalling app as i type....  
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:11:30
agreed...day or 2 tops. and ethought is correct as well....ethereum completes in an about an hr/little less
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:23:16
mem pool wasn't the topic @ that time in that reply...
i do think blocks need to be larger. how large? that's objective at best...
the point earlier was really about people and their emotions....topic coulda been summer dresses, rings, or how to raise kids...it just happen to be about btc.
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:49:04
and allow you to buy/sell btc w/o being in any way responsible...all while making a fortune on chargebacks.
im done with paypal, and i cant believe im saying that.
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:43:03
no shit....taper dude.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:41:22
lmao....touche'. btw, i personally hate ethereum....waay too much to deal with, esp if you have any on paper wallets, and simply not worth it imho...i was just commenting on what the other user said about it.

@_date: 2016-12-07 17:31:14
circle just hung themselves from the rafters.....
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:19:30
i hate coinbase.... i was overdrawn a couple times on my acct bcuz of lawnmower b4 it changed. bcuz of that i can't buy btc..... and uno what? i could give a damn.... their pricey, have crappy cust support, have the irs up their ass, etc..... so... imho? GOOD RIDDANCE! 
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:04:53
brother no offense, but wtf ru doing keeping THAT much on an exchange??
and btw, i need details....wtf happened? they just "outta the blue" locked ur acct? i doubt it....
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:52:13
bro thats a very good ?....
when i did my 1st initial/trial purchase, i did the min they offer which is $30....and for that i received .03168 btc...this was just a few days ago too....which was about $25 worth....soooo, i really dont know, lol....
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:11:27
btw - any1 hear of coinpayments? theyre huge, accept all coins under the sun, and are a basically a big online altcoin store....meaning there are real stores where you can buy all kinds of  sh*t with various altcoins.
xcoins should t o t a l l y check them out.....
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:32:24
UPDATE RE: INDACOIN:
there must have been a glitch yesterday...its back to normal today. theres a $5-$10 difference now depending on how much you get.....
*ALSO* USE THE WALLET APP - NOT THE SITE!!! YOU GET A SLIGHTLY BETTER DEAL!!!
just an fyi.....
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:33:18
ive been using bitpay (site and app) for a couple months now, and am overall pleased....
please keep adding features, and security.....thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:40:54
i soooooooo feel ya....i was with them from the very beginning as well...
im gonna try celery....sigh
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:49:45
but uphold is good....you can turn it into almost literally any currency you want
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:30:01
try indacoin.com.....thats their site. theyre the same people that have the wallet apps from Freewallet.org
ive used the btc (android) wallet for a little while now with zero issues....and its instant.
the support seems really good too. they connect with you immediately as soon as you go on the site or the app....main dudes name is narek.
*UPDATE* indacoin price back to 'normal'...BUT USE WALLET APP TO BUY...NOT THE SITE! (you get a slightly better deal)
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:21:45
virwox is waaaaaay too much work......
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:48:59
checked it....its interesting. im sure you know about celery.....
theres also wallofcoins.com, bitcoin insanity (little pricey and i think only 1 purchase per day), obv Bitquick, but who the f*ck wants to have to walk to the bank?! theres also a weird new company outta Finland called Denarium (Denarium.com) that sell ACTUAL PHYSICAL coins made of brass, etc.(theyve got a Christmas series as well, lol). the coins are worth varying amounts obv, from very very small to reg. amounts. the key is built in the coin, you can add to the amount thats on the coin, etc. its kinda a cool idea actually....DEF check out denarium.com
ANYway, thats it off the top of my head...oh yeah, 1 more is cryptonit.net. i havent used them yet but the site looks pretty cool, and im pretty sure theyre legit cuz they emailed me back asking for more 'verification' bs.....
anyway...gl guys
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:49:35
brother ive heard that from a couple different people lately....thats y i havent used them either.
glidera is supposed to be decent, but not instant...
for instant buys, lately ive been using the btc wallet app by freewallet.org. ive used it 5 or 6 times and its worked fine evrytime. very ez to use as well....
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:13:04
correct brother...they eventually realized they werent really making much $ (as you mentioned), and then how every1 started going apeshit over blockchain/payment processing/blah, blah, blah....
guess im gonna close my acct...i mean wtf's the point? i can store btc anywhere, &amp; what they're basically now offering i can do (and have been for awhile) with uphold...
s i g h....sooo disappointing though.
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:09:34
i used to love paypal....that's obv changed. you CANNOT allow something to be bought/sold through your system and have ZERO liability.....
that's f*cking insanity.....
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:09:49
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:07:07
lol....    ;)
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:00:54
uphold is pretty good...it used to be coinarch which i LOVED....but they obv went a different direction (like freaking circle....sign - still so unreal).
again, im trying a couple new places as well as going back to expensive cex, but if ne1 knows any good/legit sites to buy instantly with dc/cc...please lemme know.
thanks!  :) 
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:45:05
bro whatd you get taken for? im dealing with a very similar situation....
there is a new company that ive mentioned on here b4 and that ive hired...theyre a bitcoin bounty hunter/collections agency outta san diego with some contacts. if you really need some answers, i can tell you what ive done so far and whats the most you can do....
BUT  -  you GOTTA be proactive and be willing to do what it takes to go after the f*cker....(i realize it depends on the amount....)
anyway - gl either way my friend....
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:26:51
i did look.....its absolutely rediculous, lol.....i have no idea wtf theyre thinking.
on another note - ive heard from a couple people/friends that gocelery was very pricey and not worth it. i just looked and its not thaaat bad. the wording in the 'fee section' is weird. it makes it sound like they charge 10% AND $4.....its actually one or the other. for 20 of btc, its $24.....for 100 its $110.....the thing thats God awful is the TIME IT TAKES TO GET IT!!!! they say 'around 11 days'...
ru f*cking kidding me? 
update: i did just read this on celery..."Instant buying using a bank account is available to users who have a history of successful transactions. If you would like to request it, email us."
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:38:57
i just mentioned indacoin.com (they have the btc wallets by Freewallet.org as well), and what about bitpanda?
never used them but theyre listed in the US section, sooooo?
@_date: 2016-11-24 02:54:15
i hate coinbase as well....w/the privacy thing, and now this?!
plus i had lawnmower (in its early days) attached to my acct and it caused 3 overdraws of literally about $1 or less each, and they banned me from buying or selling btc!!!
ru f*cking serious??!!
screw coinbase....
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:08:04
circle stopping what they did best is a travesty and the ceo should be fired. what can they do now that i cant already do with uphold?? AND with a btc address??!!
they just screwed thousands of people, a LOT who were with them from the very beginning (yours included...), and they just decided to hang themselves from the rafters....
good riddance....
cex is expensive...period. bitstamp is ok....&amp; i HATE coinbase....period.
im gonna try celery....any better ideas from any1 im alllllll ears...
gl all....  
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:46:25
for the most part yes....they make it relatively ez to instantly buy btc, then when u receive it, you can send to any btc address obv. 
amount of time it takes depends on amount of btc bn sent and how bz everything is (like usual)....
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:53:43
yes....matter of fact i used them yesterday.they're not exactly cheap, but they are instant.
you should also check out Bitcoin Wallet by Freewallet.org
its for android (not sure ios), and you can buy instantly with them. the app is very ez to use as well...  ;)
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:20:11
shapeshift bro......also - do yourself a favor and LEARN....
with the internet, theres no excuse for ignorance....
(no offense....)
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:23:02
i def have my doubts about wirex/ecoin/whatever the hell theyre calling themselves these days.
they gave me an ecoin 'virtual' card, but not a real card cux im in the US.....
i actually downloaded their app, and to be honest, i found it quite useless and thought it sucked.
there are many (a good handful) other companies that one can use/register with instead witjout having to deal with this typical bs.....
do yourself a favor.....use one of them and dump 'wirex'
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:07:07
i was lending on xcoins from the beginning....doing well. 
then....got screwed sooo bad its not even funny. and when the buyers go thru their bank instead of actual pp acct? 
you're completely f*cked.....
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:49:28
no offense...but you're stupid and it's a scam. please people....this is soooo sad to read. WISE THE F\*CK UP!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:24
simply unreal where its at...and where it's still going
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:52:40
there is no defense for your actions....please, please, please....look up the word gullible. you deserved what you got.
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:37:36
same thing happened to me....i really thought they were legit cuz ive been using them for quite some time with really no issue.
then the price spiked to 500, and all of a sudden the sites down....and STILL DOWN, and NONE of their links work
coincidence...i think not
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:08:52
there's obv a lot of options, but for noobs, squares cashapp is really the easiest...and u can wd instantly as well.
