A lot of men in these crypto subs aren't great financial decision for women either hahaha. To many people throwing to much in. Lol

This is why they should have increased the block size just a little bit to ease the load a bit. Off chain settlements are the way to go with bitcoin but I feel they have screwed the pooch when it comes to market adoption with noobs. 
Noobs are finding litecoin and eth much more reliable and fast for getting into the crypto space so btc isn't really being used other than to trade alts with once on exchange. 
Saying that though, there was no way of knowing how much adoption was going to happen. Its been rather crazy. But lack of prep for a technology that has the potential to take over global currencies doesn't really scream confidence with the current devs.....
Glad I diversified and only hold 10% of my position in btc.

Subbed. Really good info! Specifically no memes, moon talk or price speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:43:31
Yup totally. The current dip is a great time to buy though. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:09:11
Clearly a shitty photoshop job! This sub is nuts!

Don't get me wrong, btc has had a major run and will be around for a long time....but when do you think it will be ready for mass adoption? It obviously isn't ready now....do you have any links on the timeline of scaling solutions being implemented?

Also says a lot about actual adoption as useable currently. The probability that these segwit addresses are new and hodl addresses means that the bitcoin as digital gold argument is still there. 
Adoption is adoption though, so there's that. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:14:54
You got a link to all that?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:24
Lol 72hrs isnt good enough.

That's a job for autodesks flame. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:46:34
Well then not photo shop that's a job for autodesk flame! :-)

But they keep adding more carriages to increase the amount of people they can move from a to b.....

What's bitcoin at now???
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:10:02
I bet you were all over the 1mill comment when it was all over r/bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:39:28
Awesome! Thanks for the info! When I watched Andreas talk and he compared crypto now to the early 90's email, that really put some perspective on it for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:50:15
Didnt your mom ever tell you not to believe everything you hear on the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:37:58
I personally am not coming back to bitcoin until I see fees and transaction times that are reasonable. Hence it only being a small percentage of my portfolio. 
Btc is only useful to me on exchange where I don't actually use the blockchain. To get some money in there I transfer my mined alts and then change when on exchange to bypass the block chain all together. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:57:13
Lol how? Buy a lolly pop for $1 pay $21 hahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:28:41
This guy doesn't get what crypto is/was trying to achieve...
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:42:07
Just use your btc? The network is still working right? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:35:46
TBH, if I was to go travelling in Europe or the States etc, I probably turn my AUD into Bitcoin and use Bitcoin ATM's around the world to access my funds. 
Only problem with this idea is its a little too volatile and ill have to take out 1000 at a time to make it worth the tx fees.
Plus the issue with FUD making the Blockchain at times pretty slow and expensive to utilise. I would have had to wait awhile last week if I wanted to get access to my funds lol. 
Looking forward to when litecoin adoption happens because it's tech is more advanced than Bitcoin and has more use cases other than a store of value. :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:02:48
There are a few articles around but I mostly look at the update and improvements stuff that happens. I'm not a litecoin fan boi or anything but they seem to have their shit together when it comes to implementing upgrades and changes etc. I suppose that is a benefit of the smaller market cap and less general adoption, they can be more daring and agile.
The first atomic swap between btc and ltc happened the other day which is pretty exciting!

How is this protection any different to a bank holding your millions when they are crashing. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:56:53
Yeah, say you wanted to change your litecoin to Bitcoin. At the moment it's pretty cumbersome to do it. Segwit upgrade that happened in August for Bitcoin enables this to be easy, and you don't have to wait for on chain confirmation for your funds to be cleared. Very cool
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:31:39
True. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:54:35
Nailed it!

Survivorship bias is the epitome of the crypto community. I just never realised it until you pointed it out... 
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:07:08
I was mining for the most part but I did put money in. 
Not alot of money tbh, there was more outlay for my amd Vega 56s and rx480s than anything else.
The point I'm making is that everyone wants adoption. I was apart of that massive uptake in adoption and the majority of adopters were burnt.
The narrative of only put in as much as you can afford to lose is fine and all but when you have adotopion that everyone wants and the people who are late to the party (who are the majority) get burnt, you can expect them to come back in in the same full force.

Most people who have bitcoin now is due to its crazy runnup last year. We got the raw end of the deal at the current price and will never spend it on something like a trip to a science center or a museum because we would be now paying 3x the price for a ticket 12 months later....
Untill the price of Bitcoin goes above 10-15k, people are in HODL mode like myself waiting to get their money back.
Edit: words.
