The same is true if they are kept in far-away safe deposit boxes. "Pick up your phone, tell them to send me the keys or I shoot you."

So are you trying to address the problem of an occasional delay when your customers are being paid by Coinbase users? I don't see how you could possibly solve that problem.

Who is "we"? Do you work for BitPay?

That doesn't seem like it'd scale very well.

Didn't seem to explain it. It's also slightly concerning that Brian's answer on the backend question is, "we try not to discuss the backend much because it might lead to abuse." A bit scary being made to think that if someone happened to know how it worked they could abuse it in some way.

No offense, but that doesn't really instill confidence.

Ah, I see, thanks. Just curious, but why is the 15 minute time frame important to your customers?

I have no problem with cold storage but their description of their procedure really doesn't make any sense to me. Why safe deposit boxes around the world? The private keys are strongly encrypted so you could keep them in redundant, and not even very secure, locations off-site to address the risk of physical attack/catastrophe but there isn't a good reason to not also keep them onsite and offline. And what do they do with the encryption keys for the offline wallets? Give those to another set of people all over the world?

No, I'd just like a more transparent understanding of how they handle customer coins.

It works that way because they say it works that way isn't really a sufficient answer IMO.

Is it that great for a day-to-day wallet if other customers can affect your ability to get your coins out when you need to? Maybe with current volume it's not much of a problem (maybe) but if Bitcoin is going to experience the growth most of us foresee how could this policy possibly scale with that growth?
