I bought a new motherboard, some thermal compound, and a new wireless adapter from new egg recently. Getting to be time to start adding some back in here.

This is really the only indicator that matters.

One thing Im not seeing anyone talk about here..... is the financial firms getting involved.  
I know that if I had a shit ton of money behind me, and a nice thin market to play in.... specifically one where lots of people had just spent way more money than they should have (remember some of the house mortgagers) at a price that was way inflated at the time...... I would be creating lots of selling pressure (by borrowing btc, and selling it) in order to force all these knuckleheads into selling to me at a much lower price where I could cover my short, and back up the truck to go long.

Believe me when I say that the price of BTC is not what threatens the banks.   
  
It is most certainly what threatens all the people who leveraged themselves to buy way too much BTC in the last year, but thats about it.

I was coming to post exactly this.  
At first glance I almost creamed myself. Then I realized the bit coin phishing had begun, and my willy wilted.

That depends.... If it was a freebie by the person who normally does $1 blowjobs, Id probably still pass.

Even Better :)

As far as I'm concerned....... THATS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR.

He charges in USD. So.. lets say he works 40 hours. The client gets a bill for 40 x $USD_RATE. Lets call the result X. The client then takes $X and buys bitcoins, sending them to PotatoBadger as payment.

lol off on paying people to mow other peoples lawn. Is there a subreddit for that?
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:48:56
I like that attitude!

Yes. This is the image they sell on TV. Ever seen futurama? Remember the character mom? Im convinced that character is based on Warren.

Couldn't agree more. Im not sure that the actual document says anything related to what this tl;dr does... but the tl;dr is a great read so we'll just go with that!!!

Where else can you get that kind of ROI?  
I dunno about you but Id love to have an extra 5k 3 years from now.
Worst case.. your out $35.
