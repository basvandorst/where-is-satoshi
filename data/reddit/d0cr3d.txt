Think of LN as the World Wide Web. To get from your phone to reddit you go from your phone to your home internet provider which then links up with another provider to share network, then to the hosting company then to the server. There's a lot of hops in there, even more than I mentioned \(just to keep it simple\). 
With LN, you would go from your computer to the node you've got a channel open on, and they are connected to other  nodes, so it routs to them, and then it goes to another node, and then finally to Amazon to but your goods. The system routes automagically to find the best route but the beauty of the system is that there can be multiple nodes inbetween you and your goal and that's ok, because they are all interlinked and get to your end result.

Awesome thread.
Protip for formatting:
Have an extra blank line between lists otherwise it's treated as the same line. Or use a bullet list (put a `- ` before each line). Or end each line with 2 blank spaces which will also force the lines onto new lines. To cancel a formatting put a backslash `\` before the item. So for your IRC channel do `\ so it doesn't format it.
You can also get  to show a preview of what the formatting would look like to help with it.

I would research 'bitcoin transaction fee amount' to get an idea what the fee is for and what the cost is based on.

This should be stickied to the subreddit. Mods please! &lt;3

TIL they are the founders of the Gemini Exchange. Interesting.

God damnit. I coulda used this like 10 hours ago when I was transferring to my Ledger.
Thanks for the info. At least now I know going forward.

No need to be rude and attack others.

There are projects being worked on to lower the transaction fees such as SegWit, Lightening Network, etc. So it will be cheaper, just give it time. It's experiencing massive growth.

Are you trying to cash out back to fiat, or are you trying to move it out of coinbase to a different wallet?

You should probably ask a tax accountant.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:06:33
Because this has legal implications and not many of us are certified in tax law, and even less in the US and wherever you're from to be able to properly answer that question.

It could be for a dummy account, or just random values he made up.

GDAX is Coinbase, so think of one and the same. There is also Gemini which I've found to work well. I've use all three I listed and have no issues. Obviously don't store significant amounts anywhere except your wallet. Such as only transferring to an exchange to trade/buy/sell then to your wallet for storage.

No there isn't a way as you are moving from one place to another and the transaction has to happen on the blockchain which means there needs to be a fee to move it.

Most of it is covering their ass, making sure they are legally covered by any regulations they have to follow.

Be sure to report that to the reddit admins and the subreddit mods by messaging and so these people can be stopped.

I've never hand anything stolen from my Coinbase account. On the contrary, Coinbase has done a LOT to help secure the accounts. They have 2 factor authentication, they have a whole new API Authentication system for ensuring you only provide permissions to those services you want. You can limit what IP addresses are able to login. In addition, you can even use your own offline wallet and secure it yourself if you don't trust Coinbase to secure it for you. Having security around your Coinbase account, isn't just about the Coinbase account, but about the password you use (hint, is it Password123 or is it something much more secure, with 12+ alpha-numberic-mixed-case-special-characters). Even more than that, how secure is your email? Do you use the same password for your email that you use for everything else? What about your security reset instructions for your email? Someone could get into your Coinbase account by resetting your password from your email then from Coinbase. That isn't Coinbases's fault, that is your own. Did you click on a link in your email that says "Please verify/login to your Coinbase account"? If so, you may have been a victim of phishing by willingly giving up your info to someone else. Again, not Coinbase's fault. What is your proof that this was Coinbase's fault? I think we would all like to see that, please.

So why did you actually sue them? I didn't see anything listed unless I'm blind.

What if Brett Stapper is Satoshi just trying to get his bitcoins back?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:26
He said that if the price for 1 BTC is equal to or greater than $10,000 in 2017 at any point (said 2 years ago) then he would eat his left ball.
