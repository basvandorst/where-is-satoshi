Scary. What if they had tweeted something to make the market crash?

If you read the post on git you'll notice this has been improved anyway already. 
..Or you could spread out of date info.

Who said anything about custodial?

.. All 25 of them reddit has founder over a 18 month period. Yup. Getting reaaaal bad.

Also,  they have more users than anyone else.. Which means the probabilities go up of some of those users getting malware,  phishing and whatever else breeching individual user accounts

Its a very naive viewpoint at the very least

... Before Coinbase there was BitInstant and Mt Gox. Just because companies sell consumers BTC and drive up the price in the short term doesn't mean they are necessarily a good idea just for the sake of it

Woah,   Facebook,  then Bitcoin leading the way on Internet privacy

How much do you practice?

FYI,  In that scenario Coinbase still knows who you are and can give anyone who either gets access to (hackers) or demands (government) Both your personal identifying information,  one of your keys,  and your address, name, phone number etc

It also just wasn't well organized this year

Hell yes! Finally

Its basically a page run by the hard core types who don't get that Bitcoin can't be huge if everyone has to download some 90s looking desktop client.  Shame though. A lot of people go there and get confused

Looks like it isn't back - Blockchain employee post

Go look at the thread...

Perhaps u/savant would also like to comment on Hive s inclusion despite:
HSTS concerns 
No secondary password 
Lack of strong PIN protection on devices

Congrats Marco. One lawyer that isn't a boot licker.

Its the way they are presented. 
Website gives the impression that to use Bitcoin you need a clean computer running multi bit or electrum. 
No sense of perspective or weighing security against how much risk one has
@_date: 2014-07-30 09:41:10
Well, also just to be clear you don't have an actual Bitcoin address with Coinbase - because you don't have a private key - you are just temporarily borrowing one of their so you can receive Bitcoin to their master wallet 
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:48:48
What about companies with multiple products?
