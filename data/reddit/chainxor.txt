Sad. What about doing something constructive instead? I am getting more and more satisfied that I dumped all my BTC for alts and the one that shall not be mentioned in this holy congregation (LOL). This community is going to shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:33:55
One thing is not ethical, it is also blatantly stupid, and prone to backfire (aka Streisand Effect). 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:31:18
Microsoft is mostly known for being late to the game, so I am not surprised at their position. LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:36:16
Tabs(tm) and Segwit - so engineer such wow :-D
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:04:11
Ónly if you assume a constant demand for txs. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:04:50
With the same amount of tx, perhaps. Whoa...the ambitions are sky high here...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:27:43
25% is not a huge gain. Right now there are over 100.000 unconfirmed txs and fees are huge. More like 1000% improvement is needed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:22
You do realize that all alts are pulled down, including BCH? Ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:03:40
...and that is why it is not inside trading. It was public knowledge and hinted MANY times over the last week. So wipe your nose and move on.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:01:43
SegWit is a trainwreck.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:08:00
Seems kinda stupid from a business perspective to cut off payment from the 3rd largest crypto. Sounds more like a Pirate Bay problem than a BCH holder problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:41:07
That is really retarded. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:04:49
Says the bcore moonboy. LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:06:15
Always close, but no cigar. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:17:25
No it is not. SehWit IS a trainwreck: 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:17:58
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:55:25
Funny. Pretty sure it was the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:46
Well, it has been public secret for like 3 weeks that it was going to happen. Just read something else than this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:03:04
Yea yea...keep lying to yourselves. You are in denial. SegWit also didn't solve anything. It was just piss in the ocean. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:59:32
bch is actually often cheaper than litecoin and there are some pretty smooth bch wallets nowadays. HandCash and CashPay are really nice to use and most merchants take bch today, so there is that.
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:28:08
Except p2p cash is very much part of the paper, and defined as a chain of digital signatures (non-seggregated). Jup, thats right. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:44:08
Agreed. This is a losers strategy.
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:24:08
If that would happen I know a couple of large pools that would be inclined to redirect hash to the Bcash chain, which actually could choke the BTC chain until  the next diff. adjustment. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:14:28
No need, but thanks. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:02:47
Adam B is happy now.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:10:23
The white paper does not explicitly state that it can't be segregated. That is true. However, if signstures are segregated they are not a chain of signatures as illustrated but something else where the nodes themselves validate. I know it is just a design choice that changes validation, but that is how it is. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:26:30
If you put the word "altcoin" in just one more time, I will believe you. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:43:42
The Satoshi white paper....and BCH is the one following it the closest. SegWit is not in the white paper for example. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:07:09
Say what you want it is in the title itself.
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:26:12
The updated code was put in in 2016. Long before Bitcoin Cash existed. BCH is not any more vulnarable to this than BTC is. 
You are just a low effort troll (apparently with reading dissability as well).
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:51:00
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:04:16
In the meantime use BCH or LTC.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:58:49
Call it what you will. I really don't give a shit.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:22:20
BCH 24h volume is at a record $2.573.040.000. Better get used to it. This is not a pump and dump, this is a significant amount of the people flipping. Sorry to say, but that is the reality. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:35:40
Of course...LOL
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:10:33
It is a free market. Deal with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:46:06
Pump and dump? How so? 
BCH has stayed afloat at above approx. $1100 since last weekend. Yeah, sure, it peaked at the almost $2400 a short while, but is up 300% compared to a couple of weeks ago. 
It is no different from the fairly sudden jumps in BTC or other cryptos. It is crypto after all, and it is volatile in nature. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:23:37
Using Bitfinex is a standard for conduct is like having Jordan Belfort formulate code-of-conduct with customer funds. Yea...that's right. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:17:27
Yes, it is a good idea to have positions on more than just e.g. BTC. I myself am hedged in a multitude of cryptos. Nobody knows who will win out in the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:46:34
I don't really care anymore. I have moved on - having spread out my portfolio. I just find the argumentation and cacophany surrounding what should have been a fairly simple upgrade...comical. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:51:10
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:53:56
The BCH developers are not against 2nd layer solutions, they are just against deliberately crippling on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:47:39
...and you know that because...?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:35:13
Ohh...and BTC has record volume as well while it is tanking. So no, this is real movement. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:41:44
Yet, they are adding BCash futures. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:29:24
Yes the FUD is becoming inconsistent. Better not give a fuck ;-) 
Meanwhile fees are still rising....
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:42
Calling something shit-"something" doesn't make it into a valid argument. 
Anyway, have a nice day :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:23:14
You have to do better than that. 
I could just as well claim that BCH has reached what took BTC 4 years to achieve in less than 3 months(!) 
Hell, most top 10 alt-coins are gaining ground like no other the last 12 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:20:26
Besides yourself and the rest of this echo-chamber, nobody else gives a shit. Yes, really.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:47:27
Spam on the blockchain...? 
Look at the blocks. It is ordinary (bit big amounts) transfers. Make your own conclusion.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:12:08
I actually use it quite a lot these days. A good number of my Steam games have been bought with BTC. However, I am using more and more BCH because it is cheaper and faster to pay my subcontractors etc. I would like to buy my games with BCH as well. Looking forward to that day. 
Yes, I know regarding 0-conf. My points is, that RBF is irrelevant, if the infrastructure is sufficiently scaled and keeps scaling with demand. That is where BTC fails so miserably. RBF is a symptom of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:48:09
A lot of volume in general is from Korea, but that goes for all cryptos. 
But keep living in denial if you want to. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:02:49
"No block size is ever big enough, but its easily too big. The only real solution to this is layered off-chain solutions, where you can selectively sacrifice some of bitcoin's traits (censorship resistance, trustlessness etc) for transactions that may not require it, but need to be cheap."
Allright. So why was 0-conf removed from Bitcoin? This was the perfect low-fee low-security transaction that was well-suited for small amounts of value for, say, a cup of coffe (and technically very simple).
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:44:30
BCH $1000 now. Still feeling clever? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:52:50
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:33:21
Maybe Ver just wants a cool product that has the potential to supersede cash as easy-to-use cheap tender. But I could be wrong of course.
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:58:51
The network fee is just the...well network fee.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:14:44
If that is the case, then I guess OP is irrelevant and nothing to worry about ;-) 
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:36:00
Roger Ver has the the exact same opinions today as he had 8 years ago. Mike Hearn rage quit, Roger decided to soldier on. Gavin Andresen keeps a low profile (idiots and trolls are aplenty) and works on BCH. Craig Wright...well....he keeps the popcorn sale stellar :-) 
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:20:19
There is no source, since it is complete horseshit.
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:55:25
The fact that it is neccessary with all these long winded apologetic writings about LN, just proves how far away LN is from a finished user friendly product.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:34:27
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:08:24
Exactly my point. Thank you :-)
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:06:37
Of course it is not a bible. It is just common sense. The Satoshi roadmap works. The proof is in the pudding.
