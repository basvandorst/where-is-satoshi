Yes. This is called LincolnCoin (LCN). Each one is worth ~BCN 0.00000249

People are able to buy way more ***on credit***. Consumer credit was barely a thing back then. You might have a  small tab at the butcher or tavern, if you were trustworthy and known. But you couldn't just walk into BestBuy and plop down your American Express for a shiny new horse and buggy.
And I would debate the ***better*** claim. Planned obsolescence hadn't really kicked in yet back then. You could still buy a lightbulb that would last you a decade or more. And you could repair just about anything you bought. They built things to last and to be repairable. Now they build things to fail/break/be replaced on a predictable schedule. We say that this is because of faster innovation. But Apple has shown us that you need a new iPhone every year because fashion. ***And*** they admitted to slowing down older phones to inspire upgrades.
So, no.
Wages may go up slightly year after year but they haven't been keeping pace with inflation for a long time. That = less net money.

Yes. Whether there will be power/computers in 100 years remains to be seen.

That’s if you live in California.
If you are in the gulf region it’s basically a 4 month long hurricane followed by an 8 month drought.
Don’t even want to talk about Europe.
And I think the Russians all get eaten by pre-historic giant mosquitos that come out of the thawed permafrost.

Any amount of time significantly less than a human lifetime would still be useful. So as long as it’s closer to 2 decades, I’d take that. Lol

The way the US Fed Gov is going, there may not be a functioning enforcement arm soon...

Already has.
The seed was planted in 2009, germinated 9 years later, almost to the day, and now we see if it Can break through the crust of the current economic paradigm and grow or if it dies in the dirt.
Personally, I think the banking system is a big ol pile of fertilizer and the trickle of people involved in bitcoin is going to grow to a flash flood.
The question is at what price point.
And even if bitcoin died, it has still introduced a whole new world of thinking and of transacting information. That alone will be transformational and it already is...

Why not both?

The way to get your own keys is to get your own wallet (off exchange) and move your coin to ***YOUR*** wallet. Exchange hosted wallets are actually owned by the exchange. Thus you don't have the keys, thus the whole "not your keys, not your coin..." thing.
I, personally, use hardware wallets. You can buy them from the maker or Amazon. Just make sure to get them from a reputable source and make sure the tamper seals are secure before using. Some have more or less alt coin support. All supper BTC but, depending on what, if any, alts you own, you may want/need to get multiple wallets.
It's not unheard of to buy a HW wallet from an Amazon store and find that it has been opened. This opens the possibility of the wallet being compromised and could cost you any coin you put on it.
The "seed" people are talking about is a 12 or 24 word phrase like "Banana Build Welcome Happy Dingo Blaze Craft Look Happy Rock Paper Scissors etc..."
That seed phrase can be used to recover your wallet in the even it is lost or destroyed. If you lose that seed and your wallet, you lose the coin.
So to help with that, it's a good idea to engrave them on a metal plate and store in a home safe or safe deposit box. You can also get these materials on Amazon. There are several steel/titanium plates and some cheap punch sets. It's a sucky process but once it's done you have pretty solid backups of your seed that is fire/water proof.
That's the gist, anyway...

And if that cold storage only ever received?

If you have more than a couple hundred dollars worth of BTC, you probably want a HW wallet.
Remember, it's not what it is worth now but what it may be worth in the coming years.
**Edit:** My opinion on HW wallet vs others is that it's simple and contained and pretty user friendly. I would say the most important thing is to have a wallet with a seed, produce hard copies of the seed and any other important info, and have multiple hard copies in multiple sites. Like 1 copy in a home safe and 1 in a safe deposit box, etc...
If you are buying just to have some coin and just want to sit on it and not accumulate more, I would park it on a HW wallet, sort and store your hard copies, and just forget about it for 5 years.

I still remember when credit cards were new and weren't accepted everywhere. They had to break out the "ca-chunker" thing and find the carbon slips and fill them out then ca-chunk it with your card but maybe they put it in upside down or the imprint didn't take so they had to get another slip and start over... Now they are ubiquitous and almost mindless to use... Although chip and pin really throws people. But that is usually the fault of the businesses/payment processors having different processes/standards.

This is correct.
The only way there will be an issue is if there’s less BTC on hand than is owed.
Otherwise it should be a ***great*** thing for the exchanges.

Or a conservative. Could go either way TBH.

I feel like it’s going to bounce between $3500/4500 for the next couple weeks and then start a slow climb up.
**Edit:** People downvoted yet here we are back below 4000 after hitting 4200...
**NotherEdit:** Hmmm
