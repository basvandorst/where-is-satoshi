Even better example of how far the **Internet** has come!  Yes, BBSs were private networks but they used some of the same file transfer protocols still in use today.  BBSs and Compuserve didn't go away instantly.  They were pioneering technologies that *merged* into the Internet we use today.  The Internet just worked better because we only needed 1 connection (to the ISP) rather than a separate connection to each site.  The original Compuserve didn't actually shut down until 2009 and Compuserve 2000 still connects to the broader Internet.  No one here can predict the future and you may very well be right that Bitcoin won't survive past a hard fork that is necessary to make it truly viable as a global currency.  If (or when) any true competitor to BTC arrises, Bitcoin investors will have opportunity to exchange their coins or go down with the ship.  Yes, investing in BTC is risky and no one should be loyal to a "brand" of crytocurrency that doesn't change with humanity.  Anyone who held their Books-a-Million or Pets.com stock past 2000 didn't do so well.  Where we differ in opinion is I think BTC is not a lost cause at the "ripe old age" of 6 years.

You do realize the dollar's supply has only been expanding since its inception, right?  So to own the same percent of all dollars, you will need to continually acquire them.  Oh wait, I just explained inflation.  Bitcoin's money supply is also expanding (but unlike dollars) its rate is not controlled by humans and there is an upper limit of how many will ever exist.

I was actually agreeing with:


Then disagreeing with:


What matters (if Bitcoin ever becomes globally 
"successful") is the percent of coins you acquire.  For long term holders, low prices are actually positive (what said) and detrimental to short term speculators.

I know the comparison is done a lot, but please think of the Internet in the 90's (if you were using it then).  On dial-up, I'd start downloading a 30 MB music video before bed (so that after 8+ hours, I could watch all 4 minutes of it the next morning).  Now I can watch YouTube anywhere I desire from the palm of my hand.  Bitcoin (like the Internet) is just a tool that humans can alter to fit their needs.  It improves as humanity demands before performance.  Obviously at this second, not many are adventurous enough to put their money on the line (or just don't have the desire) to use an experimental currency in its infancy.  However, as it becomes more clear that paper money was never designed to be transmitted over the Internet, trustless digital currencies will evolve at the pace humanity demands.

Not that its necessary, but here is another great quote that exposes the author's ignorance


What?!  To send a smart contract I have to send a whole bitcoin with it?!  So it would cost over $200 to use this silly blockchain thing for anything useful?  What a rip-off.  /s

I get your point, but it also depends on the buyer's intentions any time bitcoin is purchased.  There are many things Bitcoin does well regardless of its market price.  People who met Bitcoin in November 2013 (who had intentions of investing in the currency) have been screwed over by Bitcoin more than any central bank.

Do not leave out terrorism!  I hear Al Qaeda and ISIS have donation addresses.

Is it better than scribbling on a receipt and hoping your total is typed correctly (when your card is swiped)?  Bitcoin is push-only.  So once you pay, there is no possible way the merchant can extract a different amount.

Yeah, the screenshot is from accessing the US version with Tor Browser (not signed into Google).  I thought it was filter bubble as well.  But now that I access it (not even an hour later), Bitcoin has disappeared.
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:29:39
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:44:59
Yeah, it has since disappeared.  Screenshot was taken an hour ago.

[You betchya!](  Get you some!

You are doing the Lord's work.
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:36:36
Yay!  Much love!
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:22:56
Do you accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:32:41
That was anticlimactic and disheartening.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:40:05
The risk is low.  There's quite a few ways to integrate it into your checkout.  Go with Bitpay.  You can choose what percent you want to be in bitcoin/fiat.  You choose how much price fluctuation you want.  Best of luck!

At least someone can confirm I'm not trolling.  [Google Trends]( isn't too exciting and I don't think it updates fast enough to confirm/deny trending in News.  However, even at the current depressed levels, Bitcoin in 2014 is still (on average) twice as popular as it was in 2013.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:34:50
This is mostly true and [here]( are Blockchain.info's graphs that approximate USD transaction volume.  However, over multiple years we are still seeing over $40 million per day compared to 2013 when over $20 million per day was a rare occurrence.  Its hard to say how much of this is just reshuffling to different wallets and how much is "real" economic activity on the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:28:43
It would be easiest to claim a paper wallet with an application (referred to as a "wallet") that has "sweeping" functionality.  "Bitcoin Wallet" (Android), Mycelium (Android), Breadwallet (iOS), and others accomplish this.

Please do not find joy in the suffering of other crypto brothers and sisters.  We are all delving into this new realm of digital currency and must fight the urge to divide.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:08:55
I'd check out BitPay.  It allows you to easily accept Bitcoin as a merchant.  You can choose what percentage of Bitcoin sales to keep in BTC (or automatically convert to your local currency to limit your volatility).  Welcome to Bitcoin and thanks for supporting the economy!
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:33:38
If you check [Google Trends]( Bitcoin in 2014 was about twice as popular as Bitcoin in 2013.  Throughout most of 2013, the price hovered around $100.  So it would indeed make sense that $200 is about where we should be when you neglect the ridiculous rally (whatever that was) at the end of 2013.  I'm also neglecting the effect of new BTC entering the economy from mining (this should push price down).

Very good point.  I know its a rough estimate.  A lot is not being considered.
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:36:17
Please come up with a good plan on how to fairly distribute a new currency to humanity.  Yes, few people hold the majority of both bitcoin and fiat.  But how does this prove anything or make BTC inferior?
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:40:31
No, but I would trust multiple $10 USB sticks in different physical locations.
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:30:40
How can I use Bitcoin to encrypt my identity?  When was this functionality added and just how much of my identity will be encrypted?
@_date: 2015-02-14 04:17:43
Yeah, I know.  Even responding to trolls is a waste of my time.  Thought I might as well call out their bullshit and pose a question.  Not that any real discussion will come from it.

Or if you didn't lose them, theres a good chance you would have bailed once you were sitting on &gt;1,000% gains.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  If you still want on the Bitcoin train, there is no time like the present and only risk what you can afford to lose.
