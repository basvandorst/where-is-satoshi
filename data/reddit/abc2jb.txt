Holy shit I have never heard truer words spoken. I feel like all I do I check alt prices at the moment.

Is Request Network not going to be better at what the LN is trying to do? Would the fact that it is an off-chain solution be an issue?

I've already invested way more than I *should* lose. I'm just wondering how many Bitcoin I need to keep my future children out of the work house. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:02:28
That amount of BTC per person... it sounds awfully close to what the Bitcoin time traveller stated was the mean holding of the average person in 2025...
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:29:15
Maybe. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:55:44
Guys, how many BTC should someone aim to own? What's the magic number? 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:36:20
Do you think it's a good price to buy BTC now?
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:38:49
I'm hoping a similar thing will happen with my Vechain and Elastos investments. I don't think the price boom that BTC and ETH experienced will be the last of their kinds..

Isn't the valuable metals market one of the most manipulated markets in the world?

Just use cointracker.io
If your total trades for the year are under 250 (i think), it auto populates an 8949 form for you. Costs $110ish.

Good going dude. Do you have an opinion on any specific alts? I'm down 70-85% on a few different ones and I'm thinking real hard about if I should eat the losses and consolidate into BTC. I'm only now just realising the true value of BTC. But damn, swallowing such a huge loss feels wrong. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 12:27:09
Oh, great Lord of the future, please tell me more about what will happen. Your knowledge is vast and unequalled. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:27:48
Could you explain how?

Comparison numbers assuming BTC's future adoption rate
**World population**
40,000,000 (Estimated BTC owners) ÷ 7,530,000,000 (world population)
= 0.00531
Current adoption rate of BTC, if we assume a future adoption rate of 100% globally, represented as a %
= 0.531%
**Innovator phase**
**Individuals with a bank account**
40,000,000 (Estimated BTC owners) ÷ 3,937,000,000 (estimated number of individuals with a bank account) 
= 0.010
Current adoption rate of BTC, if we assume a future adoption rate similar to Bank Accounts, represented as a %
= 0.10%
**Innovator phase**
**Individuals with access to internet**
40,000,000 (Estimated BTC owners) ÷ 3,800,000,000 (estimated number of individuals with access to Internet)
= 0.0105
Current adoption rate of BTC, if we assume a future adoption rate similar to Internet access , represented as a %
= 0.105% 
**Innovator phase**
**Individuals with a Mobile Phone**
40,000,000 (Estimated BTC owners) ÷ 4,680,000,000 (estimated number of individuals with a mobile phone)
= 0.008%
Current adoption rate of BTC, if we assume a future adoption rate similar to that of Mobile Phones, represented as a %
= 0.8%
**Innovator phase**
If BTC breaks out of the realm of niche investment into a truly global phenomon like some of the above categories, then at this moment we are sitting in the Innovator phase.

If you were down 70-80% on some of your holdings, would you still be tempted to convert to BTC? thats where I'm at right now. I'm slowly coming around to just how important BTC may be and I think im willing to take a pretty big hit in losses. I just need validation...

I saw something called 'wallet of satoshi' earlier. Anyone know much about it?
