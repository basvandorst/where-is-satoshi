Agreed. I have a working theory that CCN was bought out covertly an individual or establishment with an anti-crypto agenda. I mean just take a look at stories they print since they were "going to close down" because they were broke, and now all of a sudden they're not. (not that they had top notch reporting previously, but it's become decidedly more negatively slanted) Stuff like: Australian Couple Loses $900K to Crypto Scam Despite Regulator’s Efforts and Disgusted Bitcoin Trader Says Price Charts Mimic an Ugly ‘Penny Stock’ are just two recent headlines that can be found on the site right now.

Thanks for playing everyone. The reward was claimed by u/Warglaaah who DMed me first with the location of the coin. 100,000 Sats sent. Congratulations. Hope you all have fun searching.

Can you back that up? It'd be great if you could quantify and qualify any of the subjective statements you just made. 
For example what do you mean by "like the Vatican or Caymans"?
What do you mean by "burn" and what do you mean by "tons" (in comparison to what? Gold mining @ 475M Gigajoules/yr? Paper currency minting @ 39.6M GJ/yr?)
No inhabitants? Maybe you consider a population of over 32 Million wallet holders almost none? Maybe you know many Bitcoin tourists? Data seems to suggest there are more HODLers and institutional investors than ever before.
Nobody really knows EXACTLY how high the share of renewables in Bitcoin is, but that's what the research aims to uncover. 
Bitcoin miners are much more financially incentivized to keep energy costs low than say, any average household, business, or nation. Doesn't that mean renewables?

Good start, thanks for humoring us. So you come here to vent but don't care to elaborate on your claims? That's not venting, that's throwing a tantrum. That shit's lazy. Starting arguments begins with slinging arrows. Starting conversations begins with asking questions.
How many minds can you change that way? All you're getting across is "Me Caveman. Me Mad."

The quote does not mention the "purpose" of central banks, just that central banks debase currency - because they do.
The problem with your view is that it both disregards the definition of money and ignores the process of creating bank reserves.
Money is commonly defined as “a medium that can be exchanged for goods and services and is used as a measure of their values on the market, including among its forms a commodity such as gold, an officially issued coin or note, or a deposit in a checking account or other readily liquefiable account.”
The Fed creates “readily liquefiable accounts” when creating excess bank reserves, so it is also creating money. Since inflation is properly defined as an increase in the money supply, the Fed unquestionably creates both money and inflation when it creates reserves.
Your error is to suppose that because the amount of *currency* has not grown, the *money supply* hasn’t grown. The Fed never creates currency – all the printing is handled by Treasury; instead, it creates bank deposits which are held at the Fed. In ignoring this “base money,” you make no distinction between having central bank balance sheets at $800 billion or $3 trillion.
Not only do monetary additions increase the money supply, but the effect can be vastly multiplied through the fractional reserve system.
I think you might enjoy reading The Bitcoin Standard. I think it will change your "fiat allowed for the creation of the modern world" theory. The modern world was built using Fiat, but it was only "needed" to serve the endless inflationary policies of over reaching governments. Any amount of divisible sound money is enough to satisfy the development and progression of a society. Many of the most important developments of the modern world went through a zero to one phase during periods of sound money.

Oh? Who's going to issue this fictional crypto? Who will accumulate, store and protect the gold and who will audit the reserve? Where will it be located? Who will trust the issuer not to remove the new gold standard at whim and begin inflating the currency (as has always happened throughout all of human history)?

Don't be surprised, XRP is just where disdain for "fake crypto" begins. It certainly doesn't end there. XLM sucks too, XRP just gets more attention, thus more bashing to keep it real. Advocates for fair, inclusive and trustless monetary systems take issue with any digital token that masquerades as a cryptocurrency without exhibiting the qualities of sound money because it deforms the original meaning of the word which stands for so much more than just money as 1s and 0s.
Real cryptocurrency (defined for clarity in this discussion) = SCARCE, decentralized, provably and reliably secure, fairly distributed, open source, permissionless, trustless.

The funniest thing (to me anyways) is that the head shot is from Elon on a Meme review video, laughing while reviewing memes. So many levels to this one lol.
With only 10 upvotes so far I was starting to wonder if I went way too detailed for a meme here. 
You made my whole night though, thanks. If even one person really gets it, it's all worthwhile.

Thanks for the positive attitude and rational words my friend I guess that's why they call you logical :) Yes, you are correct to say that I claim to have more coins than the wallet shows.
