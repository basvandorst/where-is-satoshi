I'm curious if you really think that people are getting into Bitcoin because a merchant with less selection than the ones they're already using (Amazon, etc.) started accepting a "currency" they have never used before.

Is Apple pulling an application from their own app store the same as killing a child to you?
Please don't answer.  I'm terrified of you if you think it's anything close.

It won't matter.  You know that.  This subreddit becomes more and more like a cult every day.  It is now within the collective groupthink to hate Apple.  Yesterday Apple was fine, today they're the enemy.  A year ago Overstock and Tigerdirect were terrible companies that they didn't care about.  Now they're "visionaries."

Truly the best way to "educate" people is to flat-out lie to them.

I got a similar response when I offered to pay my mortgage with old baseball cards and prize tickets from Dave &amp; Busters.

It's simplistic to a scary degree:  A lot of these bitcoiners believe that they're going to be the .01% of a new economy, and will only promote news that keeps that narrative alive.   They lack the ability to see that this is one of many reasons why the rest of the world would never adopt Bitcoin as the standard.

Wow, thanks for opening my eyes to that.  It's like Techno-Somalia in there.

Attacking comment without answering any of its points?  Big check on that.

That is a fucking nightmare.
