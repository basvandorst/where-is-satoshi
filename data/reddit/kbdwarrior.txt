The Deutsche Bank itself is one of the biggest risk factors. The whole "Greece bailout" was a bailout of the Deutsche Bank.

Now that the bitcoin price is a topic at work, and I've been talking about bitcoin now and then for the last few months, I was asked how much I have. I was stupid enough to tell them about my little coin stack (I only bought a few coins recently during the July dip, way too little, I regret not going all in), now they are giving me unsolicited advice to cash out and buy apple stocks, because "it's obvious that this will crash to zero soon". They think I'm stupid when I say no thanks, I plan to hodl for the next 10 years.

I'd never work with bitcoin (or other forms of money) on a windows machine. Way too dangerous. I did so many fresh installs of that crap on my girlfriend's laptop it annoys the fuck out of me. Install Linux. Or at least a dual boot with Linux that you use for Bitcoin transactions. Update it every time you boot into it and have peace of mind.

While those days where one could potentially invest a few hundreds and gain a fortune after 5 years (if one didn't sell in the meantime, what most probably would have done), it's still not too late. With 3% growth per *day* there is still a good profit to be made.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:36:56
The point is bitcoin is much easier to transfer than stocks or a balance on a bank account. No need for the dangerous part in kidnapping, the handing over of the ransom is a simple transaction.

I think there is still a lot of room for growth. Maybe there will be one or more major corrections along our way, but in 10 years you maybe will think you should have put just a little now and then into bitcoin and hodled it for those 10 years. I think even 10 bucks a month now will make a huge difference in 10 years.
When I first experienced bitcoin in early 2012 I looked at the volatility and thought this would be a great investment, unfortunately I was in debt and extremely broke and thought something like, well if I had a 10k now to invest, maybe that would be a 100k in a year or two. But I don't have 10k, so fuck it. It's for sure not worth to fuck around with a 100 bucks. Little did I know that buying for a few hundred then (what I could have afforded over the course of a year) and hodling them would have made me a millionaire 5 years later. Won't make the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:22:12
I have to admit I'm still a noob and miss the full historic context, but sitting in the audience during the announcement I have to second some of these concerns.  
What I especially think will be absolutely counterproductive are the announced marketing efforts. There are already enough loud people claiming to know the truth about the real Bitcoin, and now there is a whole organisation of important people who will tell the world the truth about Bitcoin. Also I have to expand on the point the OP is making, in the current state of the network, just having discovered a potentially fatal bug that slept in the code base undiscovered for two years, and the network still 80% running on vulnerable nodes, the last thing Bitcoin needs is artificially pushed marketing efforts. Just enjoy the bear market and let the coders code.  
While I respect the involved persons a lot, I also see some inflated egos. E.g. I really believe that the founding woman, whom I know nothing about, has only the best intentions, but the superhero drawing of herself with the "B" logo on her chest smelled really really fishy. I don't think that Bitcoin needs a self appointed marketing department in a superhero costume. That was really awkward. Reminds me a lot of Roger Ver's attitude.  
I think, if they really want to invest a part of their early adopter gains and personal efforts into the future of Bitcoin, the best thing would be to restrict their efforts to sponsoring development, coding camps, code reviews etc.  
And the name, are you guys serious, sounds just like "B" stands for "bad idea".

Honestly I think this video is mostly bullshit, western anti-cuban propaganda. Why? Well, I've been in Cuba for a few months in 2010, that was before the submarine cable from Venezuela was available, speaking spanish fluently and living with locals. As I wrote above, the whole island had only internet access via chinese satelite, some few hundred mbps for a whole island of the size of Italy. Locals had internet access, you just had to queue up. It was possible to have private internet access at home as well, you just had to pay accordingly, what made it available only in certain more upscale casas particulares (houses that host tourists). I frequently used those, and they were painfully slow but working, and I didn't encounter any censored websites, though I didn't really search for that. Probably they have a porn filter, as porn is illegal in Cuba.  
About the bloggers in Havana and the cyber militia, this is definitely bullshit. The famous blogger the video mentions, Yaoni Sanchez, has her "blog" online since more than 10 years, she lives in Havana freely, despite the proven fact that her blog is financed by "Die Welt", a german right wing nato propaganda newspaper, and the US department of defense. Now think, she openly calls for an overthrow of the government while being financed by foreign superpowers that actively try to overthrow the government. If someone did this in the US, like say being financed by Russia, IS and Al Quaida and blogging for an overthrow of the US government, what do you think would happen to them? Guantanamo is the answer. And Sanchez still lives free in Havana, is getting paid from US and Germany, is fucking rich for Cuban standards. So much to the cruel cyber police hunting down bloggers.  
Don't get me wrong, I didn't like the police there interfering into basic private stuff that should not be the concern of the state imho (eg. who fucks with whom), but the picture that is painted from Cuba being an totalitarian oppressive state is just bullshit when you've been there and lived with locals for a few months. People are insulting their government in public just the same as they do here, with no consequences at all. To go to prison you have to do criminal stuff, just like here.  
I don't know how much better the connectivity on the island could be today with the venezuelan cable, but given that the Cuban government is in a permanent struggle to build and maintain infrastructure, and the venezuelan help is down since a few years bcs they are in crisis themselves, they have probably more urgent things to fix than internet cables to every house, like build or renovate those houses before. Most people want a roof first, and then internet access. I guess people will still queue up in front of internet cafes like 10 years ago.  
The US could help to end the Cuban internet isolation very easily if they wanted, just end the bloqueo (the trade blockade) so Cuba can connect to the various submarine cables around their island, problem solved, everybody can have internet access. They would probably have porn filters, but hey, even the UK has porn filters, you don't have to search for shit like this in Cuba or China.

That's very true, but it's still concerning that the Ubuntu Software Center without warning installs packages from snap, what is basically a completely uncontrolled appstore where anybody can claim a namespace and publish whatever they want under this name. You can install all your crypto software manually and verify the packages, and still get rekt when you install some compromised software via snap that e.g. contains a keylogger. And yes, there has already been compromised software on snap, someone put miners into their packages to steal their users cpu cycles. Nobody knows how much malware floats on this snap crap.

Because that's the natural order of developing new features in a software stack like bitcoin core. First it has to run in the "core", the engine, than professional users can use it, like exchanges, and in the end you implement it in the gui to make it available to the non technical users. They decided to get it out without gui support to speed up adoption. If they had waited for gui support it would still not be released and a lot of people would ask "where is segwit?".


Man you're really lazy. May I again read from the release notes for you:
This is a new minor version release, including various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.
The third number after the second dot indicates a bugfix release, no new features.
And as I quoted above:
We decided to take the later option, but we’re also not going to wait the normal six months before the next major update
You will either have to wait for 0.16.0, join the development forces or pay someone to do it for you to speed it up. That's how FOSS works.

Well than you're using another paypal than I'm using. I'm using the paypal from paypal.com and they require that you connect your paypal account with a credit card or an account, and yes the fees are in the price you pay, they just don't advertise it. Ask someone who accepts payments via paypal, they know, or look it up on the website:
"Selling is 2.9% + $0.30 per sale"
You just don't notice, because it's already priced in by the seller for you.
Go buy something worth bargaining and look for the discounts you get when buying with credit card, paypal or cash.

Depending where he lives, he might be exempt from taxes on this (assuming the story is real), e.g. here, if you hold more than one year you are exempt from capital gains taxes. Some countries don't even have capital gains taxes on crypto.
But to the OP, assuming again you story is real, if you don't know anything I suggest you hire a trustworthy professional, a lot of people end up locking their coins away because they mess up chains or the like. Would be a pity sending 120 btc to the wrong address, wouldn't it?

Just for you my friend, I did your research, directly from the release notes:
As final preparations are being made to release Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, segregated witness has activated on the Bitcoin network and is now ready to use.
Bitcoin Core has supported creating segwit addresses since 0.13.0, but this support was designed for testing has only been available to expert users—we were waiting to see if segwit was adopted before adding segwit support to the regular user interfaces, both graphical and RPC.
The timing of segwit lock in and activation meant that we had to choose between either delaying the planned release of 0.15.0 and all its features described above or shipping 0.15.0 without a user interface defaulting to segwit.
We decided to take the later option, but we’re also not going to wait the normal six months before the next major update. Instead, our next feature release will generate segwit-compatible addresses by default. This will be made available as soon as it has been written and thoroughly tested.

This is all very inaccurate.
Almost all european countries have some equivalent rights in their constitutions that compare to the 1st and 4th amendment.
AML laws differ widely between countries, what's legal in Austria might not be legal in neighboring Germany etc., but it won't affect you as long you're not planning to do business with bitcoin.
Russia? Don't know what you're talking about. Russia is near to the Baltic, but quite far away from Portugal, in a geographical sense as well as in a political sense. Europe is quite diverse from country to country.
Terrorism is the same here like in the US, a false pretense to limit civil rights and liberties, and regarding bitcoin, a false pretense from anti bitcoin lobbyists to ask for tighter regulations. Doesn't affect you as long you're not doing business.
No bitcoin transfer, online or offline, will get you a visit of an anti terrorism police, if you deal with huge amounts you will get to know the local financial market supervision and tax authorities.
In some European countries you have a lot of bitcoin ATMs, though most are one way, change businesses etc. So you will be able to change to fiat though with bad rates and high fees. This again differs from country to country, e.g. Germany has 0 (!) because of financial regulations, Austria has &gt;60.
Check here where you want to go: 
If you want to have a bitcoin adventure and write a blog or so, go ahead.
If you plan do study and live a normal life, I'd suggest you check yourself a local bank account before.

Interesting question.
Why a laptop?
What are good sources of BTC without linking it to your identity?
What about buying a smartphone over the counter with cash, a prepaid sim, shutting down geo location, buying small sums from ATMs or in person without showing id and doing transactions in a camera free cafe with wifi where nobody knows you. And of course keep the phone and the wallet on it separated from the rest of your online or bitcoin life. Any holes in this?

That depends on a few factors.
To become a proficient programmer you have to put in many many hours for a few years, and this is hardly possible beside a full time job that has nothing to do with programming. Some people are able to do this, but this depends on how much of the rest of your life you want to sacrifice (all?), your talent, your age, how much your body tolerate sitting for hours without end etc.
If you're young, don't have any financial obligations like paying for children etc, and you're willing to accept a low wage for a few years and you really want it, I would recommend checking out companies that do bitcoin in your region or somewhere you would be willing to relocate to, and send them well formulated speculative applications where you try to convince them that you really want it. If you look at the Careers section of bitcoin related companies, they all are looking for several positions. Of course they want seniors, but sometimes you can find one who is willing to invest in a junior. Then work for 5 years and either advance to senior (and senior payment) at that company or look for something else, what will be much easier in 5 years.

Well, this is a bit misleading. This is "just" a shop where they have an ATM and OTC selling of various Cryptos. You can buy related stuff like hardware wallets (at least you can order them), t-shirts, order mining equipment and so on. And it's not the first one, it's their second shop, another one is "The House of Nakamoto" in the first district, and there is an older one of another company in the provincial town of Graz. Be prepared to pay high fees.

You should reconsider what news sources you follow and crosscheck for verification. It was Trump who threatened North Korea with complete destruction in front of the UN, it are the USA that have their fleet and bombers around North Korea, it was the US who attacked North Korea in the past, not the other way round.

Disclaimer, I'm a beginner myself, but if I got it right running a full bitcoin core node means that your node will reject transactions of the attacking 2x chain, isolating their nodes and in the end help making the attack fail. So it does make sense.
I run a node on an old laptop, you need 150G diskspace for the blockchain, once the blockchain is synced you don't notice anything anymore regarding resources.

Anybody of you guys who say "No" actually attended? If not how you know?
As a professional programmer I've been to a bunch of trainings and most were a waste of time and money, but some were absolutely worth attending. So imho it depends. A lot on the instructor and to some degree also on the other attendants. As I've not been there I can't tell. The price tag is the usual for professional trainings, so I would do it if either my employer sends me there and pays for the expenses, or I'd plan to venture into some bitcoin/blockchain business on my own and needed a jumpstart. Otherwise I'd hodl the coins or spend them on something else and work through some good books instead.

Depends whom you ask.
When you look at the all time data then there is a good argument that the price it way too high to be sustained, and a bigger correction is overdue. I think that's what's starting now (of course I might be wrong). Just like in the bubbles before, steep rise in price in a short time, then the bubble pops and the price goes down and stays down for a longer time. Until next time.
On the other hand, if you have the guts to hold over a long time, without worrying when the price is only a half or a quarter of the price you paid when buying in, just hold and wait until the next bubble.
You know that video?

As most countries we have AML/KYC laws here as well. All of the ATM operators will need your ID if you want to buy more than 500 Euros, many will want to copy your ID even for small amounts. So anonymously you can buy only small amounts at some ATMs. The vouchers you can buy at post offices etc. you have to exchange at their website, where you need a verified account. Not anonymously at all.

I wonder how ShapeShift is able to do this. I cannot imagine that they backtrack every address down to the coinbase where the coins come from to find out if a blacklisted address was involved. This would require scanning the whole blockchain on each transaction for blacklisted addresses and render the service unusable. So why did the wannacry guys not just move their coins to a couple of new addresses before sending them through ShapeShift?

Maybe he bought the top and paid a hefty withdrawal fee.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:29:39
According to  the
"fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 0.0000018 BTC/byte, [...].
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 0.0004068 BTC", 
what is at the moment 2.27 USD.
I always use the recommendation there if it's urgent, if not I go lower, you should be able to send for 70 cents and get confirmed within an hour or two.
So either your tx was not median sized but very big (had a lot of inputs) or your wallet does a bad job computing a reasonable tx fee.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:31:13
That's not correct. The fee is in satoshis per byte, therefore best calculated by the size of the transaction in byte, and the size of the transaction depends on the number of inputs and outputs. So spending 1 bitcoin as a whole in one tx is cheaper than spending 10x0.1 bitcoin in one tx, although the amount of the output (1 btc) is the same. That's confusing for beginners.
You can do transactions with very low or even 0 fees, some years ago this worked well, nowadays you will have to wait for ages until someone will mine it, eventually never.
You can use core wallet on the desktop where you can set the fees manually, I do this and calculate them from the website. I spent a few bucks on learning how to calculate fees and how long it will take.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:56:26
Don't care about that. The fewer people get in now, the cheaper it stays, the more can you buy and hodl. They will kick their ass in a few years like I do now when I think that I know about bitcoin since 2013 and was too stupid to buy then.
And if you convince someone to get in now, and then the price drops, they will blame you for losing money.

It's hard to launder relevant sums of money with bitcoin with all those AML/KYC laws in place.

I'm also rather new, I always have the same feeling, want to buy but for a better price, not now, don't buy, watch the price rise, FOMO'ing hard and eventually buying the first mini dip, but higher than I could have if I've bought in the first place.
Surprisingly I always feel relieved after buying. A bit annoyed about not having bought in the first place, and a bit annoyed about not having bought enough two dips before for a much better price, but generally relieved.
Actually, if you plan to hodl your stash for 10 years it's irrelevant if you buy +/-5%.
If I knew there would come a big dip or even crash, I'd wait for it, the point is I don't know, nobody knows for sure. I just always keep a bit of cash on the sideline waiting for the crash that will come for sure. Until I FOMO so hard that I have to buy a small dip and the cycle starts again.

As I'm on a learning path myself, I have to comment further.
While it is safe in a sense of not losing your funds, spending to the same address multiple times (i.e. "adding more bitcoin to the same paper wallet using the public key", I think with public key you probably mean address) is advised against for privacy reasons. Read here about this:
So best practice is spending **to and from** a paper wallet only **once**. If you need to add to your paper wallet it would be a better practice to sweep the private key to a wallet, and spend the new sum in one transaction to a new paper wallet, and do this everytime you have to add.
I'd recommend playing around with paper wallets, sweeping keys, spending to, etc. with small sums until you know what you're doing. Takes some time but is fun for someone with a geeky mind.

While I feel your pain and disappointment you still have to be fair to them, they have a colored box on the BCH deposit page where you have to acknowledge that **"By depositing, I acknowledge that Kraken is not responsible for any coins sent to the wrong address."**
I will continue using them because I understand that if I send BTC to a wrong address then it's gone forever, with Kraken and any other service as well as with my wallets on my various devices, so I always triple check before hitting the send button.

The main problems with operating an ATM:
First you have to find a bank that will accept the cash you bring them on a regular basis, because even if you operate a two way machine you will sell more than you buy, so there will be cash piling up.
Second is AML/KYC regulations, depending where you live. You will have to take copies of Id's for frequent buyers, check out your local laws on this.
Third is operating the things, 
 need places where to stand them up, theft proof, and someone who explains to customers how the stuff works, and emptying the cash and deposit it on the bank. As you want to set them up in your stores this is all easy for you.

A few techies buying their weed on a darknet black market is just peanuts compared to the above.

Install a wallet, go to an atm if one is near you: 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:53:02
Second bank account. Get some cash at the ATM, deposit it in the other bank account, claim you've had an expensive night out with your friends.
Alternatively grow some balls.

Thanks for the correction, you're right. I hope you can forgive me, I'm not a native English speaker, so I make mistakes now and then.
Btw, as far as I know English is not written all caps. Just saying.

Obviously you've been hacked, and obviously you're not the first one. Did you verify the signature of the download?
I'd format the disk and do a fresh install. I'd also not use Windows but Linux.
If you ever find out what happened please update, would be interesred.

Isn't it possible to construct a tx that spends to several outputs, e.g. one to whatever address one wants to spend a part of the paper wallet's value, another the paper wallet address itself, that way spending the "change" back to the paper wallet?

That's just me.
Just ask yourself the question, what do you think is easier to accept, a year or two or even three of a bear market where your investment is down to half or quarter or even sixth (happened before, look at the historic charts), or not being on board when it takes off the next time.
I had a definite answer for me.
Some people buy high and then when the price crashes they can't stand it and sell at a loss. I can go through that and hold. But for that you also must not invest more than you can hold for long.

Of course not, it's volatile as f****. You have to add a time frame to give your question meaning.

All the money in the world can't buy good taste.

Or maybe in a few weeks, or months, when the bubble bursts.

Go to a local Bitcoin meeting and trade in person. I'm sure you will find guys willing to help.

Why do you think they are safer in the core wallet than in a lightweight wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:04:01
That makes sense, thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:15:15
Why do you want to do that if you don't understand what you're doing?
