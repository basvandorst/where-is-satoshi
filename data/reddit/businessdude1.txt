I ask on reddit because I'm sure there are people here doing the exact same thing as I mentioned, so sort of looking for advice from experienced individuals.

But why is it a red flag and how could I do this without any red flags? I would like to do this completely in compliance with any laws or regulations.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:36:20
and this is a federal law correct?  
edit: and what sort of amounts are we talking about? what would be "okay" to do without a license. I'm not talking about huge amounts of money or anything, just a little side income for now.

Man this is all so confusing
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:28:05
even if I'm claiming them on my taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:31:37
is that what this is called? I'm trying to do research and learn about it, not having too much success.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:56:14
so then it is indeed ILLEGAL to trade btc on localbitcoin without a money service business license then correct?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:31:29
so if I dont require an ID, would that mean I am breaking a law of some sort?

I've seen so many conflicting things regarding this. what if I did a different payment method such as gift cards or western union transfers, would that be any different than cash deposits at banks.

I am just not getting the illegality thing. I've bought and sold mutual funds before and of course claimed them on my taxes. how is that any different than buying and selling cryptocurrency for a little side income?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:23:45
That's fine, I have no trouble doing all that. I think this is a great way to earn side income and I'm doing whatever necessary to do it legally and correctly. I don't want any trouble while doing this....

Thank you much. I will check that out now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:15:48
Thank you very much. I'm not trying to make it seem like it's an easy thing, I understand that there are many things to look into. It is just an idea that popped into my head and I am currently trying to do my due diligence. I just know that it is in fact profitable, but how profitable? I dont know.... but I am definitely interested in learning and have exhausted my googling. too many conflicting experiences. it seems to be quite a complicated venture
