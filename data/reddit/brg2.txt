"Once the public key is revealed in the presence of a
quantum computer the address is no longer safe and thus should never be used again.
While always using fresh addresses is already the suggested practice in Bitcoin, in
practice this is not always followed. Any address that has bitcoin and for which the
public key has been revealed is completely insecure."

Roger Ver is a dick but Bitcoin really needs to answer to the fact that it is less anonymous than giving someone cash. Anyone can track down and pull up someone's records simply by looking up their address. On top of that everytime you spend an address you give out your public key making it 50% more likely for an attacker to reverse engineer your private key. This is REALLY troubling to someone interested in crypto but sees these issues becoming larger when mass adoption takes place let alone when quantum computing takes hold. Then I have to create new addresses everytime I spend? Does no one else have a problem with this?

True coiners don't use transparent currencies. Btc was the prototype, now it's time for Alts

This is exactly why we need to change the financial system paradigm. When they can openly watch what you purchase and use with YOUR money and REJECT you for certain purchases, it's no longer your money, it's THEIR money you are ALLOWED to use. This is mind bogglingly outside of the ethics of self determination when the FREEDOM to use your money how you see fit is DICTATED by a private UN-elected company then there is a SERIOUS red flag. Crypto sets out to change this horrendously corrupt system by throwing out the need to have a bank in the FIRST place. Open a wallet and send money to other wallets. That is literally all we need for an economy. The audacity of these people makes me want to vomit and then back hand bitch slap every last one of them. Fuck these people and I'm sad that they still have customers they watch over like creepy little trolls they are. Sickening to say the least. Mass crypto adoption couldn't come soon enough to nail the coffin shut on this fucked up financial world we live in. Fuck I'm sick of this shit

Only invest what you're willing to lose. When BTC reached $1k, many investors with evil intentions caused a crash and a subsequent bear market when they were only in Bitcoin for the short term ride. Please, let's not make the same mistake at $10k.

This was the dip everyone was waiting for to get back on the moon rocket. Next stop: $100k
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:19:35
Exactly. Hide your money. Buy Bitcoin and never turn back. Never come back to USD. That ship has sailed and sunk. We are ALL jumping ship and getting the HELL off the island called FIAT money. We're DONE being screwed by the pseudo-intellectual elite that shove credit cards down our throats and tell us to read a book because we're so damn dumb. I'm tired of it, you're tired of it, EVERYONE's tired of it. Bitcoin will have a rough transition breaking from the old ways but it MUST happen. Hold strong and we will all make it through this.

So are BTC and ETH the two prominents? I'd like to see alt coins explode as well but I see most as bitcoin knock-offs. ETH has actual value in being Internet 2.0ish. Sorry if this teems of newbyism ;-)

except we have a real divide on precious metals. The ETFs have kept gold and silver down while central banks around the world are using those low prices to STOCK pile on the actual physical. You think Bitcoin is exploding now, wait until a real crash happens and ETFs/derivatives are meaningless. Gold will skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:41:46
Bitcoin used to be about independence from central bankers and the super wealthy running away with the average guy's hard earned cash. Now it just looks like the super wealthy guy has turned into some nerdy tech weirdo from the computer club. Same crappy economy, now with dorky annoying high school dweebs running the show.

@_date: 2013-04-03 00:33:29
it is all based off of [brainwallet.org]( which is [open source](
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:58:13
my version is [here](
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:11:27
[bitcoin.clarkmoody.com]( is great too
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:46:43
but how is it a crap site? it does what it intends to do. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:01:28
my vote's for [bitclient.org](
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:24:15
these cards are just a bad idea imo
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:25:40
bit cards are a bad idea. please stop making these

yup. It's almost like everyone WANTS another delay!!!

we need an open source, p2p, distributed bitcoin exchange. any ideas?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:07:31
with bitcoins i think it might be a little different. first of all you couldnt do much with a dotcom stock. at least with bitcoin it has usability (not a lot but it's growing) and so its better I think over stocks, which you would just hold onto.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:40:27
thirdfounder wants it at $2 so he can buy in :)
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:20:23
1. reputation - its based on brainwallet
2. no source code link - there is an image in the lower left corner that links to the github site that has the up to date changes for the site. and if that isn't good enough, you can literally view the javascript source code which is the only thing being run on the site (no php backend code)
3. no about - doesn't need it. it's self explanatory. it is a brain wallet and transaction generator in one.
4. doesn't load on https: why? is the site storing values? no. Is it sending anything back to the server? no. so it doesn't need anything other than the javascript, which anyone can see.
5. phishing? again, you can look at the javascript and all the code and see exactly what im doing.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:24:55
have you tried "brain wallets"? Essentially, you remember a long passphrase which is converted to a private key, and then a public address. [bitclient.org]( does this in one small simple script. Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:46:29
I don't see the fascination with having a file or wallet program stored on my computer. Hackers could easily break in steal the wallet file and everything would be gone. Can someone please tell me the negative to memorizing a pass phrase and using services like bitclient.org vs bulky programs like electrum, armory or bitcoin-qt. thanks
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:27:54
ive always wondered about the physical bitcoins. couldn't the original manufacturer simply copy the embedded private key? maybe we would have to trust no one did that! so, I'm not really sold on buying the physical bitcoins like this. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:51
