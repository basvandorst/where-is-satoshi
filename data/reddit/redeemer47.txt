If it goes below 6 this week, I'm selling all my coins and giving up on it

Not to mention the fact that Wikileaks was completely fine with using them and allowing transactions from them....Until they were banned. Now all of a sudden CB is "dangerous" and "unreliable". Also its a US company they have no other choice but to work with the government. Either that or close up shop. No different then any other US based company

That's true but because it was 10x less people moving BTC around so it had drastically less activity. If I had to make a guess,  It probably won't normalize until all the possible BTC is on the market or closer to it

"only own a few"   . Dude thats like over 20 thousand dollars worth. You own more BTC then probably 95% of the people on this sub

Than that means Lite coin is the lesser known Grandpa George. Poor bastard didn't get picked to go even though he shares the same bed as Joe

Well its also that until the market rate normalizes  in 10 years or so.

I'm not OP but I'll answer why. is going through a massive anti coinbase circlejerk right now. I don't like coinbase but it would be disingenuous to say its "unsafe".

I support the idea behind this but GOD DAMN is that tie fucking hideous
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:01:54
Ties are so fucking stupid. Literally just a piece of fabric we tie around our necks purely for show. Like why does this hanging fabric represent formality . Completely stupid AF

The only thing thats going to increase its value is people buying it. I feel whenever someone famous or an "expert" comes out and says its going to go back up , they are just trying to convinve people to buy in. This crash was prdicted to happen anyway. Bitcoin hit an all time high and everyone with half a brain sold. Its really that simple.   it will go bak up eventually and everyone will sell again...rinse repeat

lmao   I always tell people that whenever he says anything. Just because he's the founder of Mcafee doesn't mean hes not a total nutcase. That documentary made him look real bad

most people hate coinbase but to answer your question, yes its safe no doubt

Where did you order from?  I bought one a few days ago from the official website. I heard a lot of people had problems with the Amazon ones.
