That's awesome! I'm not really familiar with it yet but you can recover it right with the 12 work phrase..? Let me know how it works buddy! Hope you can login! Have you tried a other browser? Chrome, firefox, explorer etc? (Bet you did just checking!)

What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:20:12
yeah me too! hope it does drop alot! i bought it 3 days ago, not by mining too difficult and read online that the electricity costs more than your earning. you've got a whole bitcoin for only 320 euro's that time? ;O that's such a good deal

@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:27
True! If I'm gonna put more money into it I will indeed look into buying a ledger nano. But for now I want to keep it in a wallet and do you know if blockchain is safe or if I should use another wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:30:22
Awesome! When did you invest? Hope someone can help us!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:50:22
This is very clear! Thank you!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:21:45
Okay! I got the app for electrum how would I transfer it from blockchain to electrum?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:30:48
Thanks ! Is your bitcoin still on blockchain? (Gonna read your post)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:00
That's awesome! And I can use that with my blockchain app? Or only just the website?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:06:19
Yeah exactly, with my 50 euros worth of bitcoin gonna change it to a paper wallet I guess
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:35:19
Right! Thank you for the explanation! What phonewallet would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:43:48
Thank you! Gonna look into it right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:05
Oh yeah I get it sorry. Kinda tired thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:49
Have my stuff on blockchain as well! What is 2fa?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:54
Exactly! It works pretty good. Do you have alot of BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:35:34
Yeah I'd imagine!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:49:57
Thank you so so so much!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:36:19
200 is a good start! Think I'll be putting in some more this afternoon. What wallet do you use? Or are you still on blockchain?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:29:26
What does anyone use to check the price of bitcoin on their phone or browser? one that has a paragraph of an hour or a live paragraph!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:37:19
What is a paper wallet and how do I use that? Sounds alot safer!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:58:20
thanks i did !
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:54:04
I will! It's so much fun
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:01:26
You've got a whole BTC! That's awesome! I feel ashamed haha! I started about 3 days ago, got 50 euros worth of BTC not that much honestly it's nothing compared to anyone out here.. I really want to buy some more when it dips a little bit more! Gonna see what the upcoming years do to my 50 euros. I find it amazing honestly to see it going up and down like that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:17
using blockchain wallet as well, can't afford a hardwarewallet :/ just keeping it on their for the time being.. using all of their safety features. scared of a paper wallet. don't know what to do as well!
