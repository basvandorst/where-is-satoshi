Short answer: No, miners don't have control of segwit outputs.
Long answer: Segwit outputs only look like "anyone can spend" to old non-segwit nodes (earlier than 0.13.1). If a majority of the mining hashrate were to try to illegally spend a segwit output, they would create a blockchain fork, with only the (very few remaining) old nodes following them. The rest of the network would reject the fork block and carry on as usual, with a reduced hashrate as the only noticeable effect.

If the cap did succeed in driving the price of that sidechain's tokens up, that would be a disincentive to use it, not an incentive. Someone would create a new sidechain with the same features and no cap, and people who don't hold the expensive tokens would use the new sidechain instead. Those that did hold the expensive tokens would sell them for a profit and move to the new sidechain as well, bringing the expensive tokens back down to parity.
But really, that's such an obvious trap that no one would start using that sidechain in the first place.

You have to consider what kinds of ends people are seeking as distinct from what kinds of means they think will achieve those ends.
I want to maximize happiness, liberty, and prosperity for everyone. Those are the ends that I am seeking.
I am an anarchist. I want to abolish the state, because I think doing so will further the ends that I am seeking. Abolishing the state is the means by which I seek to achieve my ends.
I used to be a progressive. I used to promote democracy and involvement in the democratic process, because I thought that would further my ends of maximizing happiness, liberty, and prosperity for everyone. My desired ends were not different, just the means by which I sought to achieve them.
Progressives largely desire the same ends that I do. Progressives who support Bitcoin probably do so because they think it will further their desired ends more than it will undermine the ability of democratic governments to further those ends.
Some Bitcoin supporters think that Bitcoin itself will abolish the state. I don't think it will, and I assume that progressive supporters of Bitcoin don't think it will either. I do think that the existence and growth of Bitcoin will make the task of abolishing the state easier.

TBH, the dumb moon predictions, while dumb, are usually more realistic than the predictions of worthlessness. $0 a year from now is about as likely as $1M a year from now; the chance of either one happening is vanishingly small.
When Bitcoin was less than a dollar, did you think it would make it to $32? When it was $2, did you think it would make it to $266? When it was $80, did you think it would make it to $1100ish? With Bitcoin hanging around $300-$400ish, $10,000 a year from now seems unlikely, but given what's happened so far it's not totally implausible.

I think that's just something that the Darkcoin folks were spreading around. Lack of anonymity can cause regulatory problems too, on the consumer protection side of things.
The main barrier though is, what exactly would they implement right now? Zerocoin doesn't scale, and Zerocash is vaporware thus far. Coinjoin doesn't need to be built into the protocol, just into wallet software. There's some other stuff that some alts are experimenting with, but there's nothing solid enough to merge into Bitcoin yet.

Yep. A paper wallet is just a private key and corresponding public address that you print or write down on paper. You can send to the address more than once.
Once you're ready to withdraw your coins from the paper wallet, you should "sweep" all of the funds off of it, in order to avoid accidentally losing some. After that you shouldn't use that paper wallet anymore, and should create a new one if you want to put your coins back into cold storage.
Paper wallets aren't the only method either. If you have a spare computer, you can leave it disconnected from the internet, wipe it completely and install a new OS (or use a live CD), and store your coins on there. Armory or Electrum are good wallets to use for this.

* Plan on not seeing a return for 2 or 3 years. Do not panic sell if things are looking dicey before then. The Bitcoin market will try to scare you into doing so.
* Buy in gradually. Pick a dollar amount to invest each week or month, and just keep doing that. This makes price spikes (in either direction) not matter, and lets you benefit from a gradual long-term uptrend.
* Do not attempt to day trade or otherwise time the market. You **will** lose money. If you luck out with good trades early on, it'll go to your head and you'll keep trading until you end up at a net loss. Unless you're seriously planning to make trading your full time job, just don't do it. Even if you are, trading is a shitty high-stress job.
* Avoid altcoins and crypto-equities like the plague. Scam risk there is **very** high.
* As others are saying, don't invest more than you can afford to lose (both economically and psychologically), and read up on how to secure your coins.

Depends what your criteria are for that. Bitcoin is still a very young currency, so it's very volatile. The volatility makes it unsuitable as a unit of account. There's been more upward volatility than downward, so it's been a great long-term store of value, but an iffy short-term one. It's been working fine as a medium of exchange. Liquidity is low compared to major national currencies, but it's high enough that you can sell a few thousand dollars worth of it without much slippage.

You seem to misunderstand what an ASIC is. ASIC stands for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit". An ASIC can be made for any algorithm that you like, but it will only run that algorithm, because the circuit is carved into the silicon wafer and can't be changed. The advantage is that an ASIC will run that algorithm much faster and use much less power than a general-purpose CPU (or GPU, or FPGA) would.
So the distinction here isn't between Litecoin mining hardware and Bitcoin ASICs. The Litecoin miners are scrypt ASICs, and the Bitcoin miners are SHA256 ASICs. They are two different application-specific integrated circuits, for two different applications.
The reason I pointed out that there are now scrypt ASICs for mining Litecoin is that "ASIC proof" (and "GPU proof" early on) was one of the talking points that Litecoin advocates would bring up as an advantage that Litecoin supposedly had over Bitcoin. Now that they've got their own ASICs, they've generally shut up about that one.

Sidechains will be merge-mined with the main Bitcoin chain. Miners don't have to choose which chain to mine on, they can just do so on all of them.
Merge-ming does carry some centralization risk that will need to be addressed. At the very least I would expect that sidechains won't be implemented until after Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers catch up to current chip fabrication technology. At that point further gains in processing power will follow Moore's law instead of the current parabolic curve.

@_date: 2014-11-17 09:55:37


There's no real guarantee of this. Obviously we can't rule out that some altcoin will find a niche where it's able to survive, but it'll have an extremely weak network effect and poor security due to being confined to that niche. This also assumes that sidechains don't end up being implemented into Bitcoin for some reason. It's more likely that niche altcoin usage will be realtively short-lived.


Anonymity is a widely-demanded feature that the Bitcoin core devs are generally in favor of supporting. There aren't really any proven technologies for this that would be appropriate to implement into the protocol itself right now though. For now most anonymizing technology will be implemented outside of the protocol in the form of peer to peer mixing networks.
Blockchain-based currencies are not an appropriate technology for implementing loyalty points. Centralized servers are just fine for those, since they're issued and managed by a centralized entity. There's no actual problem that needs to be solved there.

Current Bitcoin ASICs are made using chip fabrication technology from 2010. Once ASIC manufacturers catch up to modern chip fabrication technology, gains in hash rate will slow down to match Moore's law. This means that each generation of ASICs will last longer before becoming obsolete. Supply will catch up with demand, and it will become easier for smaller mining operations to get access to the same units that the larger farms are running.

Maybe inquire with prospective charities in advance? If a whole bunch of tips are sent to a charity, but the charity decides for whatever reason that they can't accept them ([like the EFF in 2011]( it ends up being an empty gesture.
I'm also not sure how I feel about introducing ChangeTip as an intermediary between donors and charities. The strength of Bitcoin for charitable donations is that it removes credit card companies and their fees, resulting in more money for the charity (also there's that whole censorship-resistance thing). While ChangeTip adds a social element which can inspire more donations, their 1% withdrawal fee removes some of the appeal of using Bitcoin for this purpose in the first place.
If you want your donation to have that social element, maybe consider donating to a charity that already accepts Bitcoin, and then tweeting (or whatever) about it, linking to your transaction on the blockchain.

Sidechains aren't a competitor to Bitcoin, they're an expansion of the Bitcoin's capabilities. The sidechains feature will allow Bitcoin to copy any useful features of any of its current or future competitors. A sidechain isn't a separate system from the main Bitcoin chain, it's a new component of the existing system.
The primary innovation here is that there's a firewall between any new component that's added, and the stable, reliable main component that we use right now. These firewalls protect the main component and the rest of the system from damage if anything goes wrong with one of its subcomponents. This allows us to *safely* add experimental features, test them, and allow users to use them while they're being tested, without jeopardizing everyone's money. Without the sidechains feature, our options for adding new features to Bitcoin are:
1. Proceed *extremely* slowly and carefully, rigorously inspecting and debating each proposed feature, trying to build up a supermajority of supporters among both users and miners, while trying our best to counter misinformation from trolls. Once consensus is achieved, plan a date several months or years in the future to have a hard fork. Once the day arrives, hold our breath and hope that the transition goes smoothly and that we didn't miss some critical flaw in the new feature that will destabilize or destroy the entire system, potentially taking the entire global economy with it (depending how far in the future we're talking about).
2. Implement the new features on an entirely new and separate system, with a brand new ledger. The new system will be stuck with a tiny userbase, weak network effect, and poor security. Anyone who wants to use the new features will have to exchange their bitcoins for the new system's tokens on a shady exchange which has a nontrivial chance of losing or stealing their money. Further, the existence of this system will provide ammo to cryptocurrency skeptics to claim that Bitcoin won't survive in the long run, and will be replaced by something else. While this isn't likely to be the case any time soon, it does give people reason to doubt the long-term viability of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, which hinders adoption. The existence of the new system also puts the financial interests of its users at odds with those of Bitcoin's users, giving each group incentive to try to undermine the other.

When you say "open source software", it is most commonly understood to mean software that fits the [open source definition]( as in you can modify and redistribute it. While it's not unheard of to refer to "look but don't touch" style licenses as "open source", it's very rare, and not what most people are going to think of when they hear the term.

Altcoins can't copy Bitcoin's [network effect]( Bitcoin (the system) becomes more valuable as more people use it. In order to take advantage of this value by participating in this system, you need bitcoins (the currency), not altcoins.

If you say so. The altcoin market looks pretty weird right now if that's actually the case.


Did you actually read my comment? This is not exactly an ideal situation:


@_date: 2014-11-09 18:03:48
No. There's no decentralized way for the system to know what price its coins are trading at.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:36:23
Mainstream users, by definition, are going to be the last ones to get involved. They'll be pulled in by the network effect, once it becomes more convenient to use Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions than it is to use their local fiat currency.
What's important right now is going after the low-hanging fruit, which means black and grey markets. Drugs, evasion of taxes and capital controls, gambling, etc. As we draw in more of these users, they'll boost Bitcoin's network effect, allowing us to reach new demographics. We're starting to see some use for remittances, for example, but we've still got a ways to go in that area.
Buying and selling drugs has arguably been the most successful application of Bitcoin. Compared to trading in person, the price is lower, the quality is higher, and the risk of violence is far lower (from the buyer, seller, police, rival sellers, etc). There's been significant mainstream media coverage of these advantages. Hell, we've even got mainstream journalists criticizing the FBI for making the streets more dangerous by taking down Silk Road. If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.
There's still a lot of room for improvement, though. Only a tiny fraction of the drug trade takes place through Bitcoin, markets are still being taken down, buyers and sellers are still getting busted, and coins are still being seized. More anonymous transactions are necessary, as are multi-signature escrows (which are a feature of Dark Wallet). Better markets are necessary too, but anonymity and multi-sig are part of that.
You'd have a point if the vast majority of black and grey market trade were already taking place through Bitcoin, and the efforts of law enforcement to stop it were being thwarted at every turn. We're not there, and there's a lot to still be gained by focusing on anonymity.

Your reply is irrelevant. Re-read your original statement:


For your statement to be true, each new altcoin must be *guaranteed* to take market share away from Bitcoin. There is no such guarantee.
You're essentially saying, "there are lots of different things that people can use as money, therefore nothing will catch on as a widely-used standard". This is clearly false.

No comment on in particular, but the fact that someone hasn't disappeared yet doesn't mean they're trustworthy.

**Halfway through writing this, I realized that I probably should have just linked you to [this article]( Here goes anyway:
To say that a currency is "backed by gold", for example, means that you can redeem a unit of that currency for a fixed amount amount of gold, and that the bank issuing that currency has enough gold to cover all of the circulating currency.
It doesn't make sense to say that fiat currency is "backed by force", at least not using the above definition. You can't just redeem a dollar for one can of whoopass. So when people say "fiat currencies are backed by force", they're using a much less precise definition, something more along the lines of "fiat currencies derive their value from the threat of force by their issuing government".
Specifically, the issuing government demands tax payments from anyone who engages in trade or owns property within that government's claimed territory, and demands that those payments be made with that government's currency. Anyone who refuses will have their property forcibly seized, as well as possibly being beaten, jailed, or killed. In practice, this has usually been sufficient to create demand for fiat currencies, giving them enough value to act as a usable medium of exchange.
When skeptics say that "bitcoins aren't backed by anything", they're using the same definition of "backed by" as in "fiat currencies are backed by force". They're saying that there's no mechanism by which bitcoins can gain the initial value needed to be used as a medium of exchange. They of course have to ignore the fact that bitcoins have been successfully used as a medium of exchange for several years, by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people, and in the meantime their value has climbed rapidly. The skeptics see this as some kind of mass delusion-fueled fluke, and expect that bitcoins will lose all of their value just as soon as everyone comes to their senses.
So what did give bitcoins their initial value, though? While it may not be the only mechanism in play, one that's been identified is that Bitcoin (the system) is a unique payment system with some extremely useful features:
* Value can be transfered quickly over great distances via a communications channel
* The system is global; payments can be made to any account holder, regardless of national borders or political situations
* It is highly censorship-resistant; there is no mechanism within the system to block payments or freeze accounts, and there is no central entity that can be targeted to shut down or corrupt the system
* Payments can be made with a high degree of privacy; there is no need for payer or payee to identify themselves
* If secured properly, accounts are highly theft-resistant; it is much harder to steal well-secured bitcoins than to steal cash or gold
* Payments are non-reversible once settled; settlement occurs quickly (compared to established systems)
* Transaction costs are low (compared to established systems)
However, the Bitcoin payment system only allows transactions to be made with units of its native currency, bitcoins (note the lowercase). In order to benefit from any of the aforementioned features, one has to first acquire bitcoins. Even before the infamous "Bitcoin Pizza" transaction, early speculators saw the potential of this system (or maybe just blindly gambled on it), began buying bitcoins (using Paypal, cash in the mail, etc) from others who had mined them. These buyers gave the coins their initial value, making it feasible to trade them for other valuable goods.

It's not just about the tip amount. Remember how you guys used to use Reddit, and participate in non-Bitcoin communities before the great ChangeTip frenzy of 2014? When you are going to make one of those kinds of witty, insightful comments, that might be a good time to append a tip to the person you're replying to, **after careful consideration** of whether doing so would be appropriate to the situation. "Hey man I love that meme too! Have you heard of Bitcoin? Here's a dollar!" is **not** one of those situations.
Do not comment just to make a tip to some random person in some random sub that you would not otherwise participate in. Drive-by tip spam, even in $1+ amounts, is going to annoy a lot of people and **condition them to ignore the tips**. When devoid of context, it can look like a scam, like those random phishing/virus urls that sometimes get posted. It's much more effective to tip less often, in situations where the person is going to be receptive to it, and possibly have a follow-up conversation with you about it, and/or look into Bitcoin for themselves.
It is not unheard of for our critics to do us favors (anyone remember Bruce Wagner?). This is one of those times. Stop making asses out of yourselves, please

75% of hash power signalling for BU pre-fork doesn't guarantee that the BU chain actually gets 75% hash power post-fork. Miners have relatively little to lose by signalling for BU right now, since they get paid either way. Afterwards they'll have to follow the money.
If BU coins manage to gain a higher price than Core coins, then sure, miners are likely to stay on the BU chain. That seems unlikely at this point, though. As the secessionists, they'll have to prove themselves before any significant number of economic actors will be compelled to abandon the status quo to join them.

From the rest of what you've written, it seems you still don't fully understand proposal. To be fair, most people don't seem to understand it, including many of those who are advocating for it. That's a shame, because you are correct in that it *does* deserve to be seriously considered. It could work, but it is also potentially dangerous.
This proposal doesn't just magically make all segwit-enabled nodes start enforcing segwit rules. Generalized arguments for segwit don't really apply to it. We can't just hope that no one tries to do anyonecanspend shenanigans and triggers a chain split. This proposal is *designed* to cause a chain split. That's the point of it.
How it actually works:
Starting on October 1st, 2017 (going by blockchain time, not system clock time), any node that has been patched or upgraded to support UASF proposal will begin rejecting as invalid any blocks that aren't signalling support for the activation of segwit.
As far as code goes, that's the only change. What this does in practice isn't completely obvious, though.
Starting with a simple case, let's say you're the only one to apply this change to your node. Let's also say that the first block you recieve after the October 1st activation is flagging for segwit support. No problem, you accept it. The second block is not flagging for segwit support, so you reject it. The third block you receive... is dependent on the second block, which you rejected. The rest of the network didn't reject the second block, and continued building on it. All subsequent blocks will also be rejected. Since you are no longer accepting blocks, your node will be effectively frozen. You won't receive any transaction confirmations. You also won't know what time it is (remember, blockchain time, not system clock), so this behavior will never deactivate, not even once the rest of the network acknowleges that November 15th has passed.
At this point you're probably objecting, since the whole idea of a UASF is that it's supported by the economic majority.
Let's say that *every* node adopts this proposal, except for the miners. Well, we'll have the same result as above, except that now it's happening to *everyone*. The entire bitcoin economy would cease to function on October 1st, for as long as miners refuse to adopt this change and everyone else refuses to abandon it. Even current segwit-supporting miners don't help, since they haven't specifically adopted the UASF change. They're still building on the blockchain along with the rest of the non-segwit miners.
So, strictly speaking, a "user activated" soft fork does require support from miners. It doesn't need a majority of them, though.
In the second scenario, if 10% of the mining power also adopted the UASF proposal, the network would continue to function on October 1st, albeit at a much slower rate. Average time between blocks would be 100 minutes instead of 10, at least until the difficulty adjusts. Difficulty adjustment period would be 20 weeks instead of 2. Segwit would activate eventually, since your side of the network isn't accepting any non-segwit flagging blocks.
There also seems to be a problem specific to this proposal (though not necessarily to the concept of a UASF) in that the activation criteria for segwit is based on blockchain time, rather than block height. This means that you could potentially cause a permanent chain split *and* fail to activate segwit unless you gain enough mining power before November 15th.

Even at 40%, threat of a reorg (due to variance) probably makes the non-UASF chain too risky to use. That pushes users over because they don't want to lose transactions, and miners over because they don't want to lose income.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:03:46
The status quo is preferable to any of the "compromises" that have been offered. If they want to leave the network then so be it. Bitcoin's long-term robustness is far more important than the short-term price.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:35:59
I don't think that really works against a UASF. The forking nodes will start rejecting non-UASF blocks on the activation day. In order to orphan the blocks of UASF miners, the non-SF miners would have to abandon their own chain, accelerating the progress of the fork.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:36:08
Until the UASF achieves majority hash power (might happen immediately, might not), you would need to run a UASF-enabled node in order to transact on that side of the chain. After majority hashpower is achieved, all nodes will be able to participate in the network as normal, and 0.13.1+ nodes will actively enforce segwit rules.
Keep in mind that if you continue to transact on the old chain when the UASF has minority hash power, your transactions will get wiped out when it reaches majority.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:30:57
I think "emergent consensus" is a bad idea. The BU team and supporters don't help.
As for the block size, I favor a conservative approach, and my primary concern is the stability and reliability of Bitcoin. I believe we should do as much optimization as we can with smaller blocks before moving to larger ones.
I am vehemently opposed to any sort of "hostage exchange" arrangement where we increase the blocksize and implement optimizations as a package deal. Complaining about transaction capacity and then refusing to implement optimizations makes you look shady as hell.

I had assumed that's what you meant. How many people do you think are going to be actively paying attention to what's in that branch? Even with the debates among developers resolved, objections from users may not crop up until it's time for them to run the code. In an emergency situation, you can't afford to have a significant portion of your userbase balk at the "wishlist" updates you've included with the critical fix. Sticking with the lowest common denominator is important.
Also worth noting that keeping this extra code up to date with the main codebase and properly tested requires significant developer effort.

As you've pointed out (but then glossed over), a longer chain doesn't trump node consensus rules. 51% of the mining power can have a longer chain than the other 49%, but without sufficient demand for the coins on the 51% chain, they've just been wasting electricity.

I don't think the HitBTC market actually has an expiration date. At least I don't see one mentioned on their announcement.
Locking down BTC entered into the trading pair would at least make it possible to ethically roll back all the trades if the fork doesn't happen, since participants agree to that at the start. I don't think it would make for a very good market, though:
* Holding coins on an exchange carries a non-trivial risk of losing them.
* Having them locked down means that you have to be exposed to that risk for the entire duration of the contract, and can't put your coins to any other productive use.
* If the fork doesn't happen and the trades get rolled back, you've earned nothing.
The market would end up being very low liquidity, and would skew in favor of those who are optimistic about BU, since they're more likely to believe the fork will happen.

Not sure if you've noticed, but that feeling is commonplace on both sides of the Core/BU divide. People are seriously considering using a potentially-dangerous ["User Activated Soft Fork"]( to ram the segwit activation through and actually make some progress.
I get the frustration, and it's kind of tempting, but I still think it's a bad idea. It's not worth jeopardizing the future of Bitcoin (and potentially *all* cryptocurrency) just to gain a handful of new users now. That applies to both the BU and UASF crowds.

Segwit-enabled nodes and miners have code that directly reacts to segwit signalling. You could in theory get a bunch of miners to spoof that signal and cause segwit to activate prematurely. The effect would be similar to a UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:48:07
I'm skeptical of UASF plans, at least at this point, but I don't think this is a good argument against them. It's more of an argument against proof-of-work cryptocurrency in general.
The existence of a 51% miner cartel would be a problem no matter what. I'd be more concerned about them censoring "illegal" transactions at the behest of major governments than them throwing a hissyfit over a new transaction type.

Under the current proposal, UASF nodes would start rejecting them on August 1st. That would cause a chain split if the UASF side doesn't have 51%+ hashing power.
The idea behind this strategy is that if enough of the economy is on UASF nodes and refusing to accept coins on the non-UASF side of the chain split, non-supporting miners will be unable to sell their mined coins, or must do so at a severely reduced price. In order to continue being paid, they'd switch over to the UASF side.
If the UASF chain gains a hash power majority, the non-UASF chain will get wiped out by a reorg, and the network will reunite with segwit active. The danger of having transactions wiped out pulls even more of the economy over to the UASF chain. With enough support, it achieves a sort of snowball effect that ends any conflict quickly, possibly before it begins.
The primary danger of this plan, as far as I can see, is if it doesn't gain enough support to succeed quickly, but also has too much support to just fail quickly. Then things would get messy.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:31:34

If the inflation rate goes to zero, it invalidates his entire argument that "a transaction fee market exists without a block size limit". Given that the inflation rate will go to zero, and that he's expending all this effort to remove the block size limit, it follows that he thinks some amount of inflation needs to be preserved.
It's also worth nothing that he's arguing against a hard cap or flex cap on that basis that it requires someone to choose a correct price for block size, and that whoever is choosing gets to create winners and losers. However, he's also arguing that the price of block space is determined in part by the inflation rate. What he seems to miss is that someone would need to choose the correct inflation rate, so the same objections would apply.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:30:09


The idea is to get segwit to activate before the original proposal expires on November 15th. If you create a minority fork that only accepts blocks that signal, you'll automatically achieve the 95% signalling threshold on that fork. If you then gain 51%+ hash power and the rest of the network joins your fork, non-BIP148 segwit nodes will also see that segwit is active and start enforcing it.


They don't mine them, but they will accept blocks containing them, which means that they'll follow a segwit-invalid majority chain.


The sigwit-invalid transaction could be mined with rented hash power. There also may be miners that will mine non-standard transactions in exchange for payment. I know [Luke Jr's pool used to offer this service]( not sure if they still do or any others do.

It's an option if things get really dire. Barring a sustained 51% attack on the network though, it's unlikely to happen.
Apparently semiconductor advances have hit a wall, or are supposed to soon. A slowdown there would mean an end to the race to create more and more powerful mining chips. Price drops and increased production of mining hardware would then in theory lead to some re-decentralization.

@_date: 2017-03-25 07:39:37
The UASF strategy isn't dependent on 51% hash power, just on sufficient economic support. The idea is to create a scenario where coins on the UASF side of the fork are worth significantly more than coins on the non-SF side. This draws more mining power over, and as the UASF chain gets closer to 51%, the threat of the non-SF chain disappearing due to a reorg pushes everyone else over.
The danger lies in achieving a moderate amount of economic support, but not enough to pull everyone over quickly.

@_date: 2017-03-15 23:33:13
BU having a longer blockchain wouldn't cause it to be adopted. Core nodes will start rejecting BU blocks once a block larger than 1mb is mined. In order for, say, Bitfinex to adopt BU, they'd have to specifically start running a BU node.
Some will argue that obviously Bitfinex would choose to adopt BU due to the larger hashrate. Even if they would, it would have to be a conscious decision on their part. They can't simply be dragged into it by the miners, and neither can anyone else.
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:13:39


Can you outline an attack that could exploit this?
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:49:30
You are incorrect about the 51% attack. Upgraded nodes will reject transactions and blocks that don't follow the segwit rules. Non upgraded nodes *can't see segwit transactions at all*, so you can't pay a non-upgraded node with a segwit transaction. They wouldn't generate a segwit-valid payment address in the first place.
What you can do if 51% of the miners aren't upgraded is create a chain split. You'd generate a segwit-invalid transaction that the old nodes will still accept, seeing it as "anyone can spend". However, those are non-standard transactions, so they'll be ignored and won't be included in blocks by default. You need either mining power of your own or the help of a miner to create a block that includes your transaction.
The non-segwit side of this chain split would be unstable; if the segwit side ever catches up, the non-segwit side will be orphaned and the non-segwit nodes will start accepting the segwit chain as the correct one. This creates a pretty big incentive for miners to upgrade so as not to lose income.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:48:50
If the fake segwit miners build on any non-segwit signalling blocks, those would be rejected by UASF nodes, so things would proceed as expected.
If *all* non-segwit miners started fake signalling, segwit would activate on its own, without needing a UASF. However, a chain split would still occur once a block with a malicious segwit-invalid transaction was mined. From there it'd play out in a similar fashion to the UASF, except that we'd have the support of all the current segwit miners.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:33:19

I don't think we can count on that. Supporting the activation of segwit doesn't mean that they necessarily support taking extreme measures to do so. We would need to get explicit confirmation from the relevant miners and pool operators.


That depends in large part on how *much* of an economic majority that you have. If it seems plausible that enough economic activity would continue on the old chain, the striking miners have a much greater chance to succeed.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:13:45
No, has it correct. Non-UASF nodes don't have any code to reject non-signalling blocks, so they'll continue to follow the non-UASF chain until it's no longer the most-worked.

The only way GPU mining is likely to happen is if there's a 51% attack against the network that we can't defeat by any means other than changing the proof of work algorithm. The fact that we can change it means that such an attack is unlikely to occur in the first place.

It's weighted somewhat, though. Those who are more invested in Bitcoin have more incentive to educate themselves about the issue, and also more influence over the outcome due to economic clout.
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:58:16


More than that. Difficulty adjustments happen every 2016 blocks, which would be 2 weeks if you're finding a block every 10 minutes. At 50% hash power you're finding a block every 20 minutes, so the retarget period becomes 4 weeks. At 25% hash power, it's 8 weeks, and so on.

Making the signalling date sooner is a tradeoff. It means there's less time for the economy to come to a consensus on whether to support the proposal. Some may end up opposing it just on the grounds of "that's not enough time".
I would have chosen September 1st, as that's enough to get segwit to safely activate with only 25% hash power. Not going to nit-pick it though. If August 1st is too soon, then September 1st is also probably still too soon, and we'll have to make another attempt with a different proposal after the segwit activation deadline.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:13:11
Pretty much.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:57:38


Someone did suggest that (Luke?), though I don't think there's any actual benefit. You'd just be delaying the chain split by an hour or two at most. It also makes the code more complex. The current proposal is pretty simple, it just checks the time and whether segwit is currently active.


Yeah, that was my initial reaction. I moved from "opposed" to "hesitant" when BitFury came out in support of it. They've got 12% of the total network hashrate, so this thing might actually fly.


Sure thing, you too.  :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:40:02


It can signal for segwit, but I think the miners have to make that choice explicitly. That said, it'd be nice for miners to have a "both" option when it comes to EC and SW, so that support for one doesn't preclude support for the other.

You're not going to be able to coerce an entire 20 billion dollar ecosystem into switching on short notice. Even with 75% mining power on your side, businesses, exchanges, and hodlers are going to be slow (if not completely unwilling) to switch over to BU. Without them, BU coins will have very little economic value. Original chain coins will still retain significant value even if transaction fees spike.
So that gives miners a choice. Mine BU coins of questionable value and receive low transaction fee rewards? Or mine original chain coins with well-established value and receive inflated transaction fee rewards?
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:04:48
You mean [this issue]( Older nodes *receive* blocks just fine, they just don't propagate them very well. Most users aren't producing blocks, so this isn't a problem for them.
If you need to mine on an old node, you'll probably want to put a bridge node in front of it. That old node will still be able to use the network, though, unlike in the case of a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:37:27

I think the only case in which changing the proof-of-work algorithm would be justifiable, is in response to a 51% attack that we're unable to defeat through other means. "The miners refuse to activate segwit" or even "a contentious hardfork activated and we're down to 25% hashrate" don't cut it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:42:14
User activated soft fork. This particular one would start rejecting any blocks that aren't signalling segwit readiness starting on October 1st. The theory is that if enough of the economy runs it, miners would have to switch over as well in order to continue getting paid. It's essentially a boycott of non-segwit miners.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:35:56
Then it's just a regular 51% attack, which is unlikely to happen. Segwit will be active, miners will get over it and continue making money as usual. There's no reason to believe that 51% of them will commit to an economic suicide pact.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:21:04


You don't need hash power to stop segwit-invalid transactions. Nodes already filter those out on their own.
Do you think stopping people from spending money that they don't have is equivalent to stopping them from spending money that they *do* have? Doesn't one of those indicate that the system is functioning as intended, and the other indicate that it's broken? Are miners incentivized to break the system that provides their income?




I'm not in favor of a UASF, at least at this juncture, due to the risks involved. I don't think you've correctly identified what the risks are, however.
Changing the PoW algorithm would only be necessary if a 51% attack actual occurs (which is unlikely if the UASF has already succeeded) and can't be defeated through other means. Requiring miners to update their software in order to continue getting paid may annoy them, but it's not going to "lose their support" in the sense that they would start engaging in self-destructive behavior just to prove some kind of point.

There are reasonable objections to the UASF proposal, but "border nodes sound complicated" isn't one of them.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:39:49


Using order book depth as an indicator for trading is risky at best, and this situation is no exception. It's too easy to manipulate, especially on lower-volume markets. For example, a whale could fill up the BTU orderbook in order to encourage miners to support the fork. Just before the lock-in terms take effect (75% hash power signalling?), they pull their orders. Some miners will abort their plans. The fork may happen anyway due to momentum, but it's now much less likely to survive.




How are you going to prevent traders from acting just before your terms take effect? "The terms are secret" isn't going to fly, and springing new terms on traders at the last second is going to get the exchange sued.
At least on Bitfinex traders know what they're signing up for. There are some edge cases that they missed, but those can be planned around. The best suggestion I've heard so far to improve their market is to add a binary market on whether or not the fork happens. That way you can compare the BCU price to the price of the binary market token in order to get a useful indicator of hypothetical BTU price.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:48:40
I like the idea of moving the flag date up by a month, and starting on September 1st. It's a trade off, since the economy would have one less month to prepare. However, we'd be able to hit the segwit activation deadline with much less hash power.
25% would be enough to guarantee successful activation, even if the flag date falls on the least favorable part of the retarget period. We'd have a full 8 weeks to lower the difficulty by 1/4th, and then another two weeks to activate segwit.

Responding in kind is not profitable. They're not going to undertake that kind of effort, expense, and risk for no reward.


You would have to actually examine those reasons instead of just hand-waving. Those with reasons of "can't be bothered" and "general conservatism" aren't going to join your cartel. You won't get much support from the "delay change to keep fees high" crowd either, due to that whole "not profitable" thing.


That's not why the price would drop. The price would drop because the network is being hit by a 51% attack to censor transactions. That's going to cause some panic.


We're arguing about a scenario in which the UASF has already succeeded, so I'm not sure how this is relevant.
I'm not interested in painting the UASF strategy in an overly-optimistic light. It is risky. It needs to be discussed in depth. Arguments for or against it need to be *rigorous*, however. This one does not cut it. You literally just picked up a BU supporter's half-assed conjecture and ran it with.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:41:10
"Nodes" is somewhat ambiguous, since miners have nodes as well.
The number of non-mining nodes participating doesn't really matter as much as what portion of the economy is participating. With an economic majority, a UASF will be successful. Without, it won't. And yes, that's hard to measure, so it's important to aim high.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:07:59




The strategy isn't dependent on a best-case scenario. If it did, that would make it a bad strategy. The current BIP148 proposal doesn't actually allow for that best-case scenario, since it explicitly causes a chain split by rejecting blocks that don't signal segwit support. The best-case scenario for BIP148 is to just start with 51%+ mining power.




There is no neutral. Your node either recognizes what a segwit-invalid transaction looks like, or it doesn't. If it can't recognize one, it won't know to follow the chain that rejects segwit-invalid transactions.






There's definitely a danger for status quo users. If there's a chain split, that means that segwit miners aren't a majority, and status quo nodes won't follow the segwit chain, which sets them up to lose transactions to a reorg. The anti-segwit faction doesn't need any permanent mining power, they just need to get a segwit-invalid transaction accepted into the blockchain in order to cause the split.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:20:05




I was mainly trying to impart a technical understanding of the proposal. Economics and politics play a big part, but you can't properly analyze those without a technical understanding of what is being proposed.
It also needs to be understood that miners behaving in a completely economically rational fashion is far from guaranteed. If you can get a sufficient portion of the economy to engage in a risky boycott, who's to say that Jihan can't get a sufficient portion of the miners to engage in a risky strike?




It's a substantial enough point of weakness in the proposal that I don't think it can just be hand-waved away. It potentially deters support from the economic majority, and provides a plausible goal for the opposition to rally around. How confident are you that they wouldn't be vindictive enough to try it?
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:51:05
Yes, though initiating the fork prematurely would be disastrous for them. On the other hand, if they suspect that there are a significant number of miners falsely signalling, they may be more reluctant to fork because they don't have a reliable way to measure support.
It might even be worthwhile to encourage miners to falsely signal as a general defense mechanism, not just against a block orphaning attack.

It's likely to cause a chain split, but it's not a hard fork. Hard forks change the consensus rules in an incompatible way. BIP148 is a soft fork in that once the dust settles, non-updated nodes will remain compatible with the network.

Incorrect. Non-UASF segwit nodes will follow the majority hash power. If the UASF chain becomes the most-worked chain, *all* nodes will switch over to it, but not until then.

I have read the whole thing, and I disagree.  :)


"Anyone can spend" transactions are non-standard, so C's transaction will not be relayed by the network or included in a block by miners. Non-standard transactions are only respected if they somehow make it into a block. C would need access to mining power in some way (either their own, or by paying a miner to include the transaction).


Segwit nodes and miners *will* reject block 1002, as it is invalid according to their rules. They will also reject any blocks that build off of it. The blockchain will split at this point between segwit and non-segwit nodes and miners. The funds belonging to B are still safe on the segwit side of the network.
To be clear, I'm not claiming that the chain splitting isn't a problem. It is, however, a *different* problem than B's funds just being stealable. It's also arguably more of a problem for the non-segwit side of the network than for the segwit side.

This isn't about Luke. Convincing him to adopt your plan won't convince the rest of Bitcoin's users.
Personally, I am opposed to any sort of "hostage exchange" plan to activate segwit. If you want to increase transaction capacity, then support segwit. That doesn't stop you from supporting other solutions as well, but blocking it in order to have a bargaining chip makes y'all look shady as hell.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:47:58
That would just artificially force the market to a 50/50 split, since BCC holders would have to buy BCU to get their BTC back, and BCU holders would have to do the same with BCC.
Paying out nothing for BCU tokens if no fork occurs at least makes some kind of sense. Market sentiment of "BTU will be worthless" fits well with "the fork will not happen". Likewise, "BTU will be worth a lot" fits with "the fork will happen".
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:33:39
Eh, suspending BTC withdrawals from now until the hard fork (which may not ever occur) seems pretty shady. I wouldn't blame BU supporters for claiming this market isn't representative of what the BTU price would actually be.
Thinking about it though, how would you make a market that's fairer than what Bitfinex has set up? If BU hasn't forked by the deadline, what are you supposed to pay out for BCU tokens?
* You can't make them 1 BTC, since you issued a BCU and a BCC for each BTC split.
* You can't require people to recombine BCC and BCU to get their BTC back, because that would just force the market to a 50/50 split, which isn't representative either.
* You can't just give everyone their BTC back, because people who split their BTC and then sold the tokens are no longer the rightful owners of the original BTC.
* You can't get rid of the deadline, because then the market may never pay out.
There doesn't seem to be a good way to run a prediction market on BTC/BTU without also applying the question of whether the fork actually happens.

The main downside to it is the possibility of causing a chain split. If less than 51% of the mining power supports the UASF, the rest of the network won't follow when it activates. With sufficient economic support this wouldn't be a problem, since non-supporting miners would be facing a significant reduction or total elimination of their income, and would quickly switch over. With *insufficient* economic support, this would just end up creating an altcoin that would die off quickly.
The worst case scenario is if the UASF doesn't get enough economic support to gain majority hash power, but does get enough support that it doesn't die off quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:56:49
A chain split is a non-trivial possibility. If you think the UASF strategy can't prevail in that scenario, you probably shouldn't support or promote it at all.

Maybe. I'm inclined to think it might be better to just wait things out, especially if miners are being drawn back anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-29 05:34:09
If we're going to do a UASF at all, we should be aiming for the overwhelming support scenario that you describe, just for margin of error purposes. However, it would be a bad proposal if it relied entirely on that scenario.
A UASF only needs its token to be more valuable than the non-UASF token by a margin large enough to draw profit-driven miners over. Even if it only achieves 40% of the total hash rate, that's enough to threaten (through variance) the non-UASF chain with a transaction-wiping reorg.
Four months may indeed be too little time to achieve the level of support that we want. It's probably worth thinking about an alternative plan, to be deployed after the segwit activation deadline has passed.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:26:46
Do you mean this part?:




If means that segwit non-BIP148 nodes will follow a less-worked BIP148 chain instead of a more-worked status quo chain, he's wrong. The only way that 0.13.2 and 0.14.0 nodes will follow is if BIP148 miners have 51%+ of the hashrate.
I am open to being corrected on this point, but you're going to have to cite actual code to do so.  :)

But until the fork actually happens, there's no predictive power. Traders can pull their orders as soon as they believe the fork is imminent.

So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're talking about a situation where the miners would initially accept the UASF and activate segwit?
Once segwit activates, if they then undertake a 51% attack to censor segwit transactions, it would be like any other 51% attack, and the same considerations would apply:
* They would risk dropping the price of bitcoin, which they depend on for their income
* They would demonstrate that the incentive structures that make Bitcoin work are fundamentally flawed
* They would push the rest of the network towards using the nuclear option of a PoW change
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:34:25

50% of nodes, or of mining power?

Potentially, yes. Depends how much support it gets. If enough of the economy supports it to make the miners take it seriously, and it starts with 51%+ hash power, it'll go pretty smoothly. With only a moderate amount of support, though, it could get messy.
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:33:27
This is to avoid the failure case of not achieving enough mining power to actually get segwit to activate before it expires. If August is too soon, then we should probably scrap BIP148 and revisit the UASF idea after the November 15th deadline.

I somewhat fit the archetype of "digital gold fundamentalist" that is describing. I've been involved in Bitcoin for a number of years, and I own a decent amount. Not anything that's going to impress the other old-timers, but enough to shock the newbies.
I favor a conservative approach to any block size increases. I do want to see Segwit implemented, though, and I like the idea of Lightning and other decentralized off-chain scaling solutions. I do want to see Bitcoin become the new world reserve currency, after all.
That said, I find it rather alarming that the BU crowd and the "why not both" concern trolls are demanding that a hard fork occur before or concurrently with the implementation of Segwit. Segwit already provides an increase in transaction throughput, and there's no good reason that it needs to be hitched to a hard fork.
Holding a beneficial improvement to Bitcoin hostage in order to advance your agenda is not a good way to get me to cooperate with you. I'm perfectly happy to stick with 1mb blocks until the big blockers get this temper tantrum out of their systems.

I'm kinda hesitant to support a UASF at this point. My main concern is it gaining only moderate support and creating a non-decisive chain split. If it does appear to be gaining sufficient support, I'll join in as well.
That said, I think moving the start date up is a bad idea. It's crucial that we give the economy time to come to consensus around the plan.

So you think that because the miners are butthurt about being required to activate segwit, after the fact they're going to form a cartel and write custom segwit-blocking code for... what purpose exactly? Spite?
The best case scenario for them is that the market only freaks out and drops the price until they stop blocking transactions. They also run the risk of convincing users to activate the nuclear option of a PoW change. At that point their multi-million dollar mining farms are bricked and they go bankrupt.

Signalling for BU doesn't impose any obligation on the signalling miner to actually mine on the BU side of a fork instead of on the Core side.


Peter Rizun (one of the BU devs) [suggested that "it might happen"](


Segwit-enabled nodes and miners have code that directly reacts to segwit signalling. You could in theory get a bunch of miners to spoof that signal and cause segwit to activate prematurely. The effect would be similar to a UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:59:37

[One of the chains has to explicitly support merged mining on the other]( Adding that support is a backwards-incompatible change, requiring a hard fork. BU would have to create a new version that hard forks at a specific date, block height, or signalling percentage, and get all of their users and miners to update to it. That takes time, and gives Core supporters an opportunity to react.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:41:31


I'm one of the skeptical commenters there. I've since shifted my stance from "opposed" to "hesitant", or even "cautiously optimistic". Bitfury expressing their support helped, since that's a good chunk of mining power.
We'll see how things play out with code review and support/opposition from major economic actors. In the meantime I'm just trying to make sure people have a good technical and strategic understanding of what the proposal entails. It's entirely possible that we may have to scrap this one and wait until after the segwit expiration to make a new proposal and try again.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:54:13

We should keep in mind that just because BU activates their hardfork at 75-80% (assuming they can get that far and don't get impatient), doesn't mean they'll actually keep that hashrate post-fork. Currently miners don't have much to lose by signalling for BU, they get paid either way. After the fork they'll have to follow the money, though. We may not end up having to wait all that long for a difficulty retarget.

If 51% of the miners already support the soft fork, then yeah, falsely signalling for it isn't going to go well for the fakers. If it has less than 51% support though, prematurely activating it would play out similar to a UASF, which may or may not succeed.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:46:10
The UASF strategy assumes that someone will create a segwit-invalid block and split the network. The hope is that when that happens, there will be a significant enough economic majority on the segwit side to attract the rest of the miners. Once the segwit side has 51%, the non-segwit side will reorg out of existence.
Things can get hairy if there isn't enough economic support for the segwit side though, so a UASF should be approached with caution, if at all.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:44:31


Would it be obvious how many were falsely signaling and how many were sincere?


Exactly. False signalling introduces uncertainty, and uncertainty causes hesitation.

This would only be true if the UASF had the support of 51%+ of the mining power. If a minority of miners are running the UASF code, the chain will split, and only UASF nodes will follow the UASF side of the chain.
If the UASF chain ever becomes longer than the non-UASF chain, the non-UASF side will be lost to a reorg. Once the dust settles, yes, old nodes will work, but until then things will be really messy.

There's no such thing as a segwit attack block in this case. This UASF, by design, starts rejecting blocks that aren't signalling segwit-readiness on October 1st. Without 51% mining power supporting the UASF, a chain split will occur, no attack block needed.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:28:05
That is how it works, though. Without explicitly making a checkpoint where the chain diverges, all nodes will follow the longest valid chain.
Core nodes won't consider blocks larger than 1mb valid, so they will never accept the BU chain. BU nodes consider the Core chain valid, so the only thing stopping them from accepting it as the "one true blockchain" is that the total work done on the BU chain is higher.

Atomic swaps being P2P doesn't change the fact that you need liquidity providers if you want the conversions to be instant. Your decentralized order book is still going to have a bid-ask spread.
Market makers will place standing orders and wait for them to be filled. Market takers will fill whatever orders are immediately available. They don't have to wait, but they get the less desirable side of the bid-ask spread.
Staying in Bitcoin allows you to avoid this overhead. You also don't have to deal with multiple units of account, or exposure to the value fluctuation of a more volatile currency.
All the reasons that people give for preferring fiat currency over Bitcoin also apply to preferring Bitcoin over another crypto. However, Bitcoin also has significant advantages over fiat, but the advantages (if any) of other cryptos over Bitcoin aren't significant enough to justify switching.

Sure, the spreads would become small, *if* the multi-currency approach becomes popular. Until then, spreads will be yet another hindrance to multi-currency users.


This is basically the "because it's cool" argument. It's inspiring to nerds, but doesn't give any reason for the average person to bother using any currency besides the one that everyone else is already using. Since we're dealing with economic network effect, we have to care about the behavior of said average person, not just a small group of enthusiasts.
In other words, atomic swaps can make the multi-currency scenario easier to deal with if it does come about, but it isn't going to cause that scenario to occur.


Were Bitcoin to suffer a catastrophic failure that destroys the market's confidence in it, altcoins would not be spared from the ensuing rush to the exits. You would lose nearly all of the wealth that you have stored in crypto. The concept of cryptocurrency would be untouchable for decades after that.
If multi-currency provides any risk mitigation at all, it'll be marginal. It's not the kind of major advantage that altcoins need in order to survive and remain relevant.


Again, this would be the case if multiple altcoins were to become well-established. It doesn't provide a reason for those alts to become well-established in the first place. Just because your vision of the future is potentially stable doesn't mean we'll actually get from here to there.

Contract 1 is our control; just a regular futures market for 2019-01-01. Contract 2 gives us a percentage chance of the BIP being activated. Contract 3 gives us a hypothetical future price for the case that the BIP is activated, modified by the chance of the BIP activating.
We can take the price from contract 3 and divide it by the percentage from contract 2 to get the actual price prediction, and compare it to the price from contract 1 to determine the predicted effect of the BIP.
Downsides to this approach are that you're splitting your liquidity across 3 markets, and you need all three of them to be highly liquid in order to get good results. It also breaks down if the BIP is either extremely likely or extremely unlikely to be adopted. If contract 2 is at 1% or 99%, contract 3 won't give a strong prediction about whether the BIP is good or bad.

Maybe, but if Bitcoin becoming more practical for payments brings in more merchants, the total number that want BitPay-like services could go up even while the percentage goes down.

I'm not aware of any adoption of Lightning on Litecoin, though it's possible since they do have segwit active. Lightning has mostly been used on Bitcoin's testnet so far.
The idea behind the "silver to Bitcoin's gold" comparison (as far as I understand) is that you should keep your savings in BTC, and use LTC as your day-to-day transactional currency. Litecoin's selling point here is faster block times and lower fees (due to increased transaction throughput). However, with Lightning enabling instant, low-fee transactions, you may as well just use BTC instead of converting your money back and forth between two currencies.
I expect the value of LTC to drop, though I don't claim to know what it'll do in the short term. Maybe investors will find some other absurd reason to hold out hope for it and it'll stick around for a while longer.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:56:33
The 2x hardfork lacks replay protection, so your transactions can be copied from the 2x chain to the Bitcoin chain and vice-versa. Bcash had replay protection, resulting in a nice clean split; supporters of each chain could sell their coins on the other chain without a lot of technical fuckery and additional risk.
The 2x folks don't want to add replay protection, because without it SPV wallets can be fooled into following the 2x chain without the user's knowledge or consent.

@_date: 2017-08-18 18:12:16
You're mostly correct. The user will still have the private keys that control their BTC, but their wallet will be following the 2x chain. They might receive an invoice for a purchase denominated in 2x coins (at a higher price due to lower coin value), pay that inflated price, and end up losing their BTC as well due to a replay attack (transactions being copied from one chain to the other). I think the unreasonably high price of the item would be likely to tip them off that something is wrong, though.
The more realistic danger is that they bill someone in BTC, that person sends them 2x coins, and the recipient mistakes those for BTC because their wallet doesn't tell them otherwise.

The fact that coins are locked for 100 blocks after being mined helps here. If you switch to mining bcash for the higher profitability, but the price crashes during the 100 block window, you might end up at a loss compared to if you'd just kept mining bitcoin.
Different miners will have different appetites for and evaluations of this risk, so they won't all switch over at once. Bitcoin enjoys an advantage here, both because of a more stable price, and because more conservative miners won't switch at all.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:48:52
I was more wondering how payout is handled when the "if" condition is false. In the case of:


Let's say BIP123 does not end up being activated. What does the contract pay out? Zero?
If the contract pays out nothing when the "if" condition is not met, that will depress the price predictions. It won't be possible to distinguish sentiment that the BIP will crash the price from sentiment that the BIP won't activate, or from sentiment that the price is going to be lower in January regardless of whether the BIP activates or not.


Possibly, but it seems like getting there would be difficult. Don't the recommendations need to be generally followed in order for the market to provide good recommendations? I guess this is in part dependent on my question about payout structure.

The fix was a soft fork, not a hard fork. Even if you're using node software that allows the exploit, you're still following the same blockchain as everyone else. You moved on, but you're no longer running a fully-validating node.


That's also a soft fork. You're still using the Bitcoin blockchain, but at a reduced security level.


They are various implementations which follow the same blockchain. When 2x is scheduled to fork off in November, btc1 nodes will need to start actively rejecting the Bitcoin blockchain, otherwise their new chain will be vulnerable to being wiped out by the original.

We've been [vocally opposed]( to 2x ever since it was first leaked to the public.

A full node primarily benefits the person using it, by verifying that all transactions received are legitimate and that all blocks follow the proper rules. Using your own full node means that you can't be deceived into accepting counterfeit coins.

They were trying to pass off their code as a "necessary upgrade to support segwit" (it's not), without mentioning that it'll be following a different blockchain. No one is surprised that they support 2x, but trying to get people to switch to your code without informed consent is extremely shady.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:44:04
You should switch to a different wallet before November. Bitpay's Copay wallet will by default be following the 2x chain instead of the Bitcoin chain if Bitpay continues on their current course.
Also, unfortunately other commenters are trying to mislead you, due to politics. As an early-ish adopter (Bitcoin still isn't mainstream yet), you'll need to do a lot of your own research to determine what's actually correct. There are a lot of charlatans out there.

The point was for you to read, not count. Of course the term "segwit2x" is more popular now, both among supporters and detractors.

It's only SPV (simplified payment verification) wallets that would get confused, since they just follow the longest chain and rely on other nodes to make sure that chain is valid. If there's a 2x node telling your SPV wallet about the 2x chain, and if that chain is longer than the Bitcoin chain, the SPV wallet will follow that.
Full nodes are immune because they verify the entire blockchain themselves, and would detect that the 2x chain isn't valid.


2x referrers to the capacity doubling. Segwit already includes a block size increase to 2mb (on average). 2x will result in an average block size of 4mb. They want to double the block size again, before we have a chance to figure out what the effects of the first doubling will be.

Bcash (aka "Bitcoin Cash", "BCC", or "BCH") isn't really relevant to Bitcoin users anymore. It's just another altcoin at this point, like Litecoin.
2x is going to be another hard fork, unrelated to Bcash. It's scheduled to activate in late November, and is supported by the companies involved in the New York Agreement, such as Bitpay. Their goal is to kill off Bitcoin so that they can force everyone to use 2x, and take Bitcoin's name and ticker symbol.
2x currently doesn't plan to implement replay protection (prevents copying transactions from one fork to the other) like Bcash does, so trying to deal with 2x coins and bitcoins separately is going to be difficult. The whole thing is likely to be a giant mess if these companies don't back down. We'll know more as we get closer to November.

Because we have serious concerns about hard forking on a short timeline, and without having a chance to study the effects of the blocksize increase that's already built into segwit; and because designing based on political compromise is terrible engineering practice.
If you insist on ignoring our concerns and forcing 2x, it's going to be a contentious hard fork. You don't get to be surprised when that creates a "third Bitcoin". The only way to avoid that is not to hard fork without consensus in the first place.

Wants are unlimited. Once a blockchain reaches a certain level of popularity, its blocks will always be filled with something. You can't separate the question of "are blocks full" from "what level of fees is acceptable", and you can't separate that from "what block size is acceptable".

It only helps keep the network decentralized if you use the node for your own transactions, instead of relying on a centralized service to tell you about the state of the blockchain. Spinning up a thousand nodes on a VPS won't force centralized services to follow the rules and not lie to their users.

The price is extremely relevant. You're not going to get a majority of miners staying on the less profitable chain. Investors are the ones who determine the prices on each chain, so [they're the ones ultimately in control]( Businesses like Coinbase are beholden to their customers.

Buying drugs through darknet markets is something that you can't reliably do without cryptocurrency, so that provides some base demand that's never going to go away.
Bitcoin also has some unique properties that make it a good store of value. While this doesn't involve actively transacting, it still counts as "using bitcoin as a currency". This is different from using it as an investment; you aren't expecting the value to grow, you're just saving it for later.
If we were to come to a widespread consensus that BTC is the best store of value, everyone would just leave their savings as BTC rather than cashing out at a certain profit level. The price would remain stable rather than collapsing, as you wouldn't have a panicked rush of investors seeking to get out while they still can.

That's not what "backing" means, in a currency sense. If a currency is backed by gold, for example, that means that you can redeem it with the issuer and receive gold at a fixed rate. This guarantees that the currency will be worth something, even if no one else accepts it.
Bitcoin is not backed by anything (and neither are fiat currencies). You can't redeem BTC and get computing power back for it.

Liquidity providers are still going to take their cut. BTC-&gt;LTC-&gt;BTC routing would be needlessly expensive, since in order to do so instantly you're taking the worse side of the bid-ask spread (twice).


They would still have less utility than BTC. Lightning invalidates any claims of being cheaper or faster that these alts might have had before. May as well stick with the more secure, more widely-accepted currency and not have to pay to exchange it with every transaction.


Inflation is an anti-feature. No one actually wants the value of their money to be inflated away.

Of course there's going to be plenty of price chatter. Partly because the overall upward price trend is a measure of our progress, and partly because getting rich is exciting. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's also not the point.

You are correct. BIP9 uses epoch time, so BIP148 must use it as well in order to be compatible.

A hard fork, on the other hand, cannot result in a unified network in the face of a dissenting minority.

A UASF isn't actually dependent on miners for activation. You pick a date or a block height at which to activate, users update their nodes, and then when the date/block arrives, the fork activates.
In the case of BIP148, the current proposal to activate segwit via UASF, it works by simply rejecting any blocks that aren't signalling for segwit activation. Your node won't accept any transactions in those blocks, and a BIP148 miner won't build on them. The blockchain splits at this point (unless 51%+ of the hash power has joined in), and the BIP148 side of the fork will consist of only segwit-signalling blocks. Once a full activation period has passed, segwit will be locked in on that side of the fork.
The UASF strategy is dependent on the economic majority of users supporting it. If they do, and if the chain splits, many miners would quickly jump over to the UASF side simply because it's more lucrative to mine. If the UASF side for the chain fork ever becomes longer than the non-SF side, the non-SF side will disappear in a block reorg and the entire network will start following the UASF chain. Because of this, as more mining power switches over, it becomes increasingly risky for holdouts to stay on the non-SF chain.
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:39:43


It's the same as the standard Core node, except that [on August 1st it'll start rejecting blocks that aren't signalling for segwit activation]( This will cause segwit to be activated before the November 15th deadline. The idea behind this strategy is that if an economic majority of users support it, miners will be forced to also implement BIP148 in order to continue getting paid. Think of it as a boycott of non-segwit miners.


If there are any particularly important updates to Core, we should be able to rebase our code to incorporate those changes. The BIP148-enforcing code is extremely simple.

You don't get to count existing segwit deployment, since signalling isn't going to reach 95%. You only get to count your new "segwit is on now" nodes.
BIP148 has the additional advantage that if it's successful, it will turn on the existing segwit deployment. Then you have 100% of the miners and 80%+ of the nodes enforcing segwit.

"Anyone can spend" is a non-issue. If I send you coins via a segwit transaction, someone else can't just spend them.
If they have access to mining power in some form, and the majority of miners aren't enforcing segwit (in which case, how did it activate?), the most they can do is try to trick a non-upgraded node into accepting a transaction that spends those coins. If that node then tries to spend those coins, the rest of the network will recognize them as counterfeit and reject them.
If you are running a non-upgraded node, I can't send you coins via segwit in the first place, since your node won't generate a segwit-enabled address.

An anti-Asicboost UASF is unlikely to have a flag date before the BIP148 flag date or the current segwit activation timeout. If we use BIP148 to get segwit activated, that will make any use of covert Asicboost much more obvious, and make a subsequent anti-Asicboost UASF more likely to succeed.

Node count doesn't matter. It's only being used as one (vague) metric of support, and doesn't actually effect anything about BIP148 activation.
In the case of buying hashrate, they could do that in an attempt to temporarily stave off a reorg that would annihilate the legacy chain and cause the entire network to follow the BIP148 chain. They'd be burning a lot of money and operating on borrowed time at that point, though.
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:24:53
Segwit being active doesn't stop covert Asicboost from being used, it just means that Asicboost miners can't mine any blocks with segwit transactions in them. They would still get the block reward and the transaction fees from any legacy transactions that were available.

Transactions on the Lightning network (a layer on top of Bitcoin) don't get individually committed to the block chain, so they don't take up block space, require paying fees to miners, or require waiting for confirmations.

Sure, one could attempt a bad soft fork, as long as it's not trying to relax any rules. However, if we're just debating whether to do a particular change as a soft fork or as a hard fork, the inclusivity is a definite advantage of the soft fork approach.
@_date: 2017-04-05 01:40:23
Blocks will be slow, but they'll still be found. You'll still be able to send transactions, they'll just take longer to confirm and you'll have to pay a higher fee on them. The higher fees will attract more miners over to the BIP148 chain, speeding the process up.
If we do actually have an economic majority backing the UASF, it shouldn't take long for miners to switch over, since they want to get paid. At 50% the non-SF chain ceases to exist, so even 35-40% should be enough to pull any stragglers over.

A 51% attack against the BIP148 chain would be extremely expensive and likely to backfire. The attacker would be diverting their hashrate from the legacy chain. If the legacy chain falls behind the BIP148 chain (even if the BIP148 blocks are produced by the attacker), it will be wiped out in a reorg. Having 33% of the total hash rate would make us immune, and even at lower amounts we'd be fairly well protected.

It actually works best if exchanges join users in refusing to accept coins on the legacy chain. I expect some exchanges will list both, but any reduction in the available liquidity for the legacy coin will push its price down.
In order to establish valuations before the split, we can set up a futures market that pays out in whatever coin type you bet on, similar to Bitfinex's chain-split tokens, BCC and BCU. This also gives us an opportunity to abort beforehand if things look bad, to avoid damaging Bitcoin.


It's a soft fork, so it's different in the same ways that any other soft fork is different from a hard fork. If BIP148 is successful, any chain split that it causes would be temporary, and afterwards all nodes will follow the new chain. A hard fork always causes a permanent chain split, because it introduces incompatible changes that old nodes can't follow.


The side that's most advantageous for miners is the side that's worth more, so that's the side that they'll choose. If an economic majority supports BIP148, then so will the miners. There's a decent chance that enough miners will recognize this in advance, and there will be no split at all.


I was pretty skeptical of it when it was first proposed. Bitfury showing their support for it made me think that perhaps it could work after all. Given the recent Asicboost revelation, I think its chance of success is high.
We'll also get to see it in action on Litecoin beforehand, since they're planning a UASF that will activate on June 1st.
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:40:16

Allowing merge mining would be a hard fork change to the BU code, so they'd have to allow time for all the BU nodes to upgrade. That'd give us some advance warning.
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:30:52
Incorrect. The plan is to abort if we don't end up with majority *economic support*, since that's what the strategy depends on. It would be rational for miners to follow that economic majority, but they may not do so right away.
BIP148 starting without majority hash power support would cause a chain split, not a hard fork. A "hard fork" means an incompatible change being introduced, which old nodes will not follow.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:48:57
Wipe-out, not replay. Replay attacks involve copying transactions from one side of a split to the other, causing those coins to move as well even though the sender didn't intend them to.

If those rewards aren't entirely worthless, the miner can still sell them even if they switch over. If they *are* entirely worthless, then the miner has nothing to lose by switching.

Set up a futures market that pays out in the type of coin that you bet on (similar to BCC and BCU on Bitfinex). Whichever ends up with the higher price is the one with economic majority support.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:45:08
BU miners attempting their fork at the same time as the BIP148 UASF would just guarantee the success of the UASF. The UASF needs 51% hash power to avoid splitting or to reunify the network, and if all the BU hashrate leaves, the legacy chain won't have enough left to avoid being overtaken by the UASF chain.
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:47:53
Not quite. BIP148 requires miners to signal for segwit activation, but it doesn't require them to include segwit transactions in their blocks once segwit is active.
If your blocks have no segwit transactions, you can still use covert Asicboost, but it becomes a lot less covert. If you're giving up any significant amount of transaction fees by mining only non-segwit transactions, that's a good indication that you're probably using it.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:01:26
How would they do that? If they try to 51% attack the UASF chain, they're diverting hash power away from the non-SF chain, making it more vulnerable. If the non-SF chain doesn't stay ahead of the UASF chain, it'll cease to exist.

@_date: 2017-04-11 00:11:09
You'd have to ask Luke. One possible reason is that BU doesn't implement wipeout protection. When it forks, the BU chain has to remain longer than the Core chain, otherwise it gets wiped out by a reorg and BU nodes start following Core again. Miners running Core masquerading as BU (for stability) screw up the estimates of when to fork for other BU miners.
If you fork because you think you have 75%, and it turns out you only have 55%, your chain is going to be in danger of just getting wiped out by variance, not to mention if any other miners actually defect afterwards.
This doesn't apply in quite the same way to BIP148 nodes. In the case of Core-as-BU miners, they have to switch their software over to actual BU *before* the fork happens, and they don't know when that's going to be in advance.
In the case of BIP148, any uacomment nodes that don't switch over before August 1st can still hook up with the BIP148 chain later. They just have to make sure to switch their software over before making or accepting any transactions.

@_date: 2017-04-13 01:35:24
BIP148 is the UASF currently under consideration. Starting on August 1st, all BIP148 nodes will reject any block that doesn't signal for segwit activation. If BIP148 doesn't have majority hash rate at that point, the blockchain will split into a BIP148 chain and a legacy chain.
If the bulk of the economy is on the BIP148 side, miners on the legacy side won't be able to sell the coins that they mine, or will have to do so at a severely discounted price. If they switch over to the BIP148 side, they'll get paid a lot more.
Once the BIP148 chain gains majority hash rate and catches up to the legacy chain, the legacy chain will be wiped out in a block reorg and all legacy nodes will follow the BIP148 chain. Any further blocks produced by legacy miners will be orphaned.
The success of this strategy is dependent on the majority of the economy supporting BIP148, which is why you're hearing so much noise about it right now.

In general, most miners will mine on whatever chain gives them the greatest return for doing so. This is the case for a BIP148 vs legacy split, as well as for a Core vs BU split.
That said, BIP148 won't involve BU unless BU miners decide to split off at the same time. They would be guaranteeing the success of the BIP148 chain over the legacy chain though, by removing their hashrate from the legacy chain.

If BIP148 has activated and a split has occurred, with the economic majority on the BIP148 side, miners will still be obligated to switch over to BIP148. Users will have no incentive to switch back to the legacy chain once they have transactions on the BIP148 side, especially considering that the legacy chain might be annihilated in a reorg at any point.

@_date: 2017-04-13 06:15:42
It's not a hard fork in any case. "Hard fork" means that incompatible changes are being introduced. There are no incompatible changes being introduced by BIP148.
Until BIP148 wins, the chain split will persist. There is no provision for the BIP148 chain to reorg into the legacy chain, since that would be counterproductive. Allowing a reorg of the BIP148 chain would mean that all of its transactions would be wiped out, so no one would want to use it in the first place.
The fact that the legacy chain can be wiped out by a reorg makes it much more likely that BIP148 will be successful. At even 30-40% hash rate, it will be dangerous to accept coins on the legacy chain, so more and more users and miners will switch over.
Ideally 50%+ of the mining power will recognize this ahead of time and start running BIP148 before August 1st, meaning that there will be no chain split at all.

@_date: 2017-04-01 18:51:41
"Anyone can spend" is not an issue. If I send you coins via a segwit transaction, someone else can't just spend them.
If they have access to mining power in some form, *and* the majority of miners aren't enforcing segwit (in which case, how did it activate?), the most they can do is try to trick a non-upgraded node into accepting a transaction that spends those coins. If that node then tries to spend those coins, the rest of the network will recognize them as counterfeit and reject them.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:50:23
BIP148 compels miners to join, or lose income. Your suggestion wouldn't do that until a majority of them had already joined.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:10:47
They'll have to run a BIP148 node (or at least a border node) to follow the BIP148 chain, but yeah, they'll probably keep using Asicboost as long as it's more profitable to do so.
They'll only mine (consistently) empty blocks if they run out of legacy transactions. I don't see this as an attack vector per se (at least not any more than Asicboost already is), since there will still be non-Asicboost miners that will mine segwit transactions. It's not ideal either though, and we should probably implement a fix for Asicboost, either before, after, or concurrently with BIP148.
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:25:35
A hard fork with anything less than unanimous support will result in a permanent chain split.
A UASF with enough economic support to start with 51%+ miner support wouldn't cause a split at all. Even with less miner support, that split is still likely to be temporary.

The BIP148 activation date is set for August 1st.

The determination of which chain will win is likely to be made *before* the flag date, not just minutes or hours after. There will be futures markets set up that pay out in whichever coin type you bet on (like the BCC/BCU market on Bitfinex).
As we get closer to the flag date, the prices on these markets will converge on whatever the actual coin prices will be immediately after the flag date. Miners are likely to choose which chain to support based on these prices, so that they don't waste any hashes on the wrong chain.

The reorgs on the non-UASF chain are caused by the fact that their nodes will accept UASF blocks, but the UASF nodes won't accept anything built on a non-segwit block. In any kind of split like this, the less-permissive side is going to be immune.
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:51:53
This is not a useful distinction. Bitcoin needs to be just as resistant to special interests "inside" the community as to those "outside" it. Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are part of the Bitcoin community, but their interests are at odds with those of the rest of us. Jihan obviously has no problem with consolidation of mining power, and Roger wants to pump altcoins.

The ETH/ETC split was a hard fork, not a soft fork. With a hard fork, the forking chain is (potentially) vulnerable to being wiped out. With a soft fork, the original chain is the vulnerable one.

Any UASF strategy is dependent on the support of an economic majority of users. Without that support it won't be attempted or will be quickly abandoned. With that support, it will succeed.
I was initially very hesitant when BIP148 was proposed, but I think the recent Asicboost revelations will provide the necessary support. We should all be pushing for it so that it goes as smoothly as possible. There's a good chance that we'll even start with majority hash power, since Bitmain has been screwing the other miners.

Here's a simplified example of a checksum. Let's say we've got an address format consisting of 10 decimal digits, with a 2 digit checksum. An address might look like this (spaces for clarity):
`58434 91049 47`
To verify the checksum, we would add up each of the first 10 digits, and check that they're equal to the last two digits:
`5+8+4+3+4+9+1+0+4+9 = 47`
If we mistype one of the digits, checksum verification will fail:
`58439 91049 47`
`5+8+4+3+9+9+1+0+4+9 = 52 != 47`
The particular scheme I've outlined here will detect an error in any one digit, but could be fooled by errors in multiple digits, such as if the ordering of two digits were swapped:
`58439 41049 47`
`5+8+4+3+9+4+1+0+4+9 = 47`

I'm mainly concerned about the outcome. If the majority wants a particular outcome, but fails to create the necessary perception to achieve that outcome, then what they wanted isn't super relevant to me.
To be clear, I don't mean this to be dismissive of what anti-BIP148 folks want. It applies equally to BIP148 supporters; if we can't get results, then what we want doesn't matter.

The UASF strategy is dependent on an economic majority, including most of the exchanges, being on board with it. Presumably the exchanges that support BIP148 would not recognize the non-SF chain at all.


I'm not sure how this would be possible. The BIP148 chain needs to remain compatible with existing nodes.


This would be expensive and risky for the attacker. They'd be giving up their regular income in order to mine coins on a chain that they're trying to kill. Those coins are only worth something if the attacker fails. They're also making the non-SF chain more susceptible to a reorg by removing their mining power from it. If another block of mining power switches over during this, that might be the end of the non-SF chain.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:27:09

While it is potentially risky, it's still a soft fork, since no incompatible changes are being introduced. Any chain split that results would be temporary, at least in theory. Old nodes will still work once the BIP148 chain becomes the longest one.
A hard fork introduces incompatible changes, and necessarily causes a permanent chain split. Old nodes will never accept blocks created under the new rules, so they must be upgraded or remain on the old chain.
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:44:01
UASF stands for User Activated Soft Fork. The one currently under consideration is BIP148. On August 1st it'll start rejecting any blocks that aren't signalling for segwit activation. Think of it as a boycott of non-segwit miners.

The 70% would still need to be capable of enforcing segwit rules, in order to avoid a chain split if a segwit-invalid transaction is mined.
Other than that, whether an individual miner wants to include segwit transactions in their blocks is their prerogative. They'd be giving up some transaction fees in order to discriminate though, so it probably wouldn't be worthwhile for them.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:36:38
Without at least 51% of the mining power actively enforcing segwit rules, there's a risk that a miner will create a block with a segwit-invalid transaction in it. This would split the network into nodes and miners that enforce segwit rules on one side, and legacy nodes/miners on the other side.
What the BIP148 UASF does is, on August 1st, start rejecting blocks that don't signal support for activating the current segwit proposal. If it isn't supported by 51% of the mining power, this will still split the network, but in a deliberate, predictable fashion. The BIP148 side of the split will then activate segwit.
The advantage to this approach is that instead of having to deal with the uncertainty of when the network will split, you know exactly when it will happen, and can be prepared for it to happen.
This strategy should only be attempted if it will be supported by an economic majority of Bitcoin users. If it is, the UASF side of any chain split will ultimately win out, and because of this may even be supported by a majority of miners right away, preventing a split from happening at all.
It's most analogous to a boycott. Bitcoin users, in a coordinated fashion, stop buying coins made by non-UASF miners, and will only accept the ones made by UASF miners.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:11:39
As we approach August 1st, the price on the futures market will converge on what the price of the tokens will be immediately after the split. If you're going to buy or sell coins on either chain after the split, you may as well take the opportunity to do it beforehand.
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:05:44
If the majority of the economy is only honoring BIP148 coins, then to them, anything that happens on the legacy chain is meaningless noise.
That said, it's always wise to take precautions to protect yourself from replay attacks. In the event that BIP148 is backed by the majority of the economy but the legacy chain isn't immediately annihilated, you may still be able to squeeze a little bit of value out of your legacy coins.
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:04:53
That's not a risk. If miners opposed to BIP148 were to hard fork themselves off the network (by activating BU, for example), they would hasten the success of the BIP148 side of any chain split that occurs. Without the opposing miners contributing their hash power to the legacy chain, it'll be that much closer to being wiped out by a block reorg.
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:00:19
There are multiple metrics to measure whether a proposal has the support of an economic majority. Some metrics are better than others.
* [Counting nodes]( is a low-quality (but not irrelevant) metric. Mostly you can conclude that if there are very few nodes supporting a proposal, then there is a lack of support. Few nodes opposing a proposal would indicate a lack of opposition. Many nodes supporting or opposing doesn't necessarily mean much either way though.
* [Statements from Bitcoin businesses]( are a better, but still somewhat fuzzy metric. You can weigh statements by the size of the businesses making them. You can also assume a certain level of agreement from their customers.
* Futures markets, such as the BCC/BCU tokens on Bitfinex, are probably the best way to measure support. The market would pay out in whichever coin type you had bet on, once the proposal goes into effect. This allows anyone who would want to buy or sell a particular coin after a split, to instead do so before the split occurs, thus establishing a price for each coin. In the case of BIP148, having a price above that of the legacy coin would mean that BIP148 will succeed.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:55:28
It's not enough for the exchange to exist. It also needs to attract buyers for the miners to sell their newly minted coins to.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:37:25
**TL;DR-** You do, but you have to keep an eye on them.
The channel-opening transaction is a smart contract between you and your channel partner, through which you'll be routing payments to the rest of the Lightning network. You each lock some amount of BTC in the contract, and then can at any time update how much of that pool of BTC each of you owns. The channel-closing transaction releases the proper amount of BTC to each of you.
Your partner could try to cheat you by using an old channel state (where they had a greater balance than they currently do) to close the channel. Because of the way the smart contract is designed, you have a certain amount of time to catch them doing this, and can then claim the *entire* channel balance (yours and theirs) for yourself.
The downside is that unlike the rest of your bitcoins, any BTC that you have in a Lightning channel must be actively monitored. You don't have to be constantly online, but you do have to check no less often than the timeout period on the channel. This timeout can be set as long as you want it to be, but if your channel partner disappears, you'll have to wait for the entire timeout period to get your coins back.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:30:55
But that's true of chain splits in general. You can't just pick the one you like better, you have to factor in its chance of success. For example, I opposed BIP148 initially, because I thought it wouldn't fly. Seeing Bitfury come out in support of it started to change my mind.
The prediction market is just a way to pick a chain in advance, before the fork occurs.
@_date: 2017-04-11 23:15:14
Depending on how things shake out, there might be a chain split.
* If you want to be on the UASF side of any split that occurs, you'll need to update to a BIP148-enforcing version of Core (official binaries aren't out yet) before August 1st.
* If you want to be on the legacy side of the split, stay on your current client. Note that if there is a split, but then the UASF side gains majority hash power and catches up, all transactions on the legacy side will be wiped out in a reorg.
* If you aren't sure which side you should be on, then don't make or accept any transactions from August 1st until the dust settles and the outcome of the UASF is clear.
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:02:59
Doing it now, in response to know-nothings demanding it would be a failure. Doing it after:
* implementing segwit and studying the effects of segwit's block-size increase on decentralization
* implementing relevant non-HF optimizations
* adopting second layer solutions and studying their effects on the demand for block space
* determining that a hard fork is *actually necessary*
would not be.

BIP148 isn't dependent on node count. Counting nodes to determine support is a little bit like counting political candidate signs and bumper stickers to determine support. It's not useless, but it's not very reliable either.
There isn't really any "purely technical" way for opponents to block BIP148. The most likely attack vectors are social. They'd look similar to what's been done to promote Bitcoin Unlimited. Fortunately the community has become somewhat hardened against those tactics.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:42:18
We've started on a new design that shouldn't interfere with yours: 
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:27:37
It's user-activated in the sense that it's a boycott (implemented in code) of non-SW miners by users. It is dependent on miners in the sense that they are reactive to that boycott to avoid losing income. The name shouldn't be taken literally and without respect for nuance.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:44:10
Same way that you'd determine how much hashrate a BU hard fork would start with: count the total hashrate of miners that have indicated they'll support it.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:38:21
Even if they couldn't turn off Asicboost (they can), that wouldn't stop them from doing a 51% attack against the UASF chain. BIP148 only requires miners to signal support for segwit activation. Once segwit activates on the UASF chain miners still aren't required to include segwit transactions in their blocks. Including segwit transactions in a block is what stops covert Asicboost from being used.
A 51% is unlikely to occur though, unless the amount of hashpower supporting the UASF is *very* small. The non-SF chain needs to be longer than the UASF chain, otherwise it will cease to exist, and the entire network will start following the UASF chain. Diverting hash power from the non-SF chain makes it more vulnerable to being destroyed. If other miners switch over while the attacker is focused on the UASF chain, the non-SF chain might lose the race.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:41:54
Here's the diff between the UASF and base versions, if anyone wants to look it over:

Having a majority of any kind is not dependent on proving it to you, specifically.
An economic majority of users is a majority of users that is weighted by wealth or economic activity, as opposed to a numeric majority that counts everyone equally.
The most reliable way to measure which side of a chain split would have an economic majority is probably to set up a futures market that pays out in coins from whichever side of the split you bet on. The side that ends up with a higher price is the one that has an economic majority supporting it.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:05:07
It's not reliant on a particular node count. BIP148 will activate on August 1st, and the overall success of the strategy is dependent on support from an economic majority of users.

No it wouldn't. Any hard fork is going to be extremely contentious.
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:30:31
Hard fork means specifically that an incompatible change was introduced, and that old nodes will not follow the forked chain no matter what.
Soft fork means that all of the old consensus rules are still being obeyed, but new rules are also being added. Old nodes will still follow the forked chain if it has majority hash power. If it doesn't have a majority, a chain split occurs, with the soft forking nodes on one side of the split and the old nodes on the other.
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:59:00
Not true. As soon as the BIP148 chain has more work than the non-SF chain, the non-SF chain will be wiped out in a reorg and the entire network will follow the BIP148 chain. This is because all nodes see the BIP148 chain as valid, but BIP148 nodes do not see the non-SF chain as valid.
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:16:43
At 30%, attacking the UASF chain would be extremely counterproductive. 33% of the total hashing power performing an attack would leave the non-SF chain with only 37%. It's likely to get hit with repeated reorgs due to variance, and will basically be dead and that point.
@_date: 2017-04-12 22:33:51
Look, I get that you're opposed to BIP148, but none of these objections are a problem for the futures market itself.


If miners are successfully 51% attacking the BIP148 chain to block all transactions, that means buyers of the BIP148 token won't be able to withdraw their winnings, but the market has done its job by assigning the winnings to their accounts.
The possibility of this sort of attack happening may push down the price of the BIP148 token before the split. That would mean the market is functioning as intended. The whole point is to have these risks factored into the price.


PoW change also doesn't matter, because it happens after the fact. It will affect the withdrawal method, but not the assignment of winnings.

This is worse than BIP148. You still have the risk of a chain split, but it'll happen at some unknown time, and the network won't be prepared for it. With BIP148 we know exactly when the split will happen (if it does), we can plan around it, take steps to mitigate potential damage, and even back out before the flag date if we need to.
also came up with another versionbits proposal that can have mandatory signalling like BIP148 does:
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:38:16
The `invalidateblock` chain would be considered a new altcoin (just like if you were to do it right now) that would be even more likely to fail than BU is. You would only be able to access it by running your own full node (which most people don't) and doing some command-line shenanigans that most people don't understand.

The myTrezor web wallet that Satoshi Labs maintains is what would support (or not) BIP148.

@_date: 2017-04-02 12:08:56
Still not an issue in that situation. If the UASF was successful and we have a unified network, the majority of miners will be enforcing segwit.
If it wasn't (yet?) successful, there will be a chain split. All of the miners and nodes on the UASF side of the split will be enforcing segwit. On the non-fork side, there won't be any segwit transactions to "anyone can spend" from. Though, we'd also have bigger things to worry about at that point.

Exchanges, wallets, etc, are only a convenient proxy for "the will of the economic majority". If the customers of an exchange want it to support a UASF and the exchange refuses, those customers will leave for an exchange that does support it.
In an extreme(ly unlikely) case, where *all* of the existing exchanges were somehow controlled by Jihan, we'd just move back to doing over the counter trades. It'd be less efficient, but the end result is the same: UASF miners get paid, non-UASF miners don't.

Alright, I'm assuming at this point that when you say "coerced signalling", you're referring to miners that will say they're in support of BIP148 and signal for segwit activation, but then on August 1st not actually follow the BIP148 chain. Is this correct?
If so, this still isn't a problem. UASFs are designed around the assumption that a majority of miners are resisting a change that a majority of the economy wants. The chain split is expected and planned for. If the split doesn't happen, that's great, but adversarial thinking is necessary.
Let's run some numbers. Going by current coin.dance numbers with some rounding, we'll say:
* 30% of miners want segwit and will support BIP148
* 40% of miners want BU
* 30% of miners want the status quo
* Enough of the BU/status quo miners will also falsely signal for segwit and claim to support BIP148 to make it look like BIP148 has 60%
* 70% of the economy wants segwit and has been convinced to go along with BIP148
* 20% of the economy wants BU
* 10% of the economy wants the status quo
* Pre-fork BTC is worth $1000, just to make the math simpler
On August 1st, BIP148 activates, falsely signalling miners stop falsely signalling, and BU miners activate their hard fork (we'll assume that BU miners and nodes have implemented wipeout protection). There are now 3 chains:
* BIP148, with 30% hash power
* BU, with 40%
* The legacy chain, with 30%
The BIP148 chains are dead even. Due to variance, the legacy chain will pull ahead sometimes, only to be wiped out in a reorg. This happens repeatedly. No one on the legacy chain can make or receive any payments, and legacy miners can't receive any income (they have to wait 100 blocks to spend mined coins), even assuming the coins were worth anything.
Miners on the legacy chain have a choice to make, since staying on the legacy chain is non-viable:
* Mine BIP148 coins, which are backed by 70% of the economy, and have a proportional value of $700
* Mine BU coins, which are backed by 20% of the economy, and have a value of $200
Miners are profit driven, so they'll go for the coin which is worth more. Let's generously assume though that a group of them worth 10% of the overall hashrate will go to BU, and the rest (20%) will go to BIP148. Since the BIP148 chain is now permanently longer than the legacy chain, the remaining legacy nodes automatically follow BIP148. Now the split looks like this:
* BIP148 has 50% hash power, 80% of the economy, and coins worth $800
* BU has 50% hash power, 20% of the economy, and coins worth $200
Which one looks better to you? Remember that if BU hadn't forked, BIP148 would have had a much more uphill battle against 70% of the mining power holding out.

"Hard fork" and "soft fork" describe the type of rule change being implemented.
A soft fork is compatible with old nodes in the sense that it only tightens rules, and doesn't loosen any. Any new blocks generated won't fail the validation rules that old nodes enforce.
A hard fork is incompatible with old nodes because it loosens some rules, or implements rules that are mutually incompatible between new and old nodes. New blocks will fail the validation rules that old nodes enforce.
A chain split refers to the blockchain splitting into two chains, regardless of cause.
Soft forks may cause a chain split if there isn't enough mining power enforcing the new rules. This split is temporary, in the sense that if the new side of the split catches up to the old side, the chain will reunify by discarding the old side of the split.
Hard forks will always cause a chain split. This split is permanent because old nodes will never accept the new side of the split.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:19:24
If a UASF has 75% user support and 75% miner support, *there is no split at all*. Everyone gets to keep using Bitcoin as if nothing had changed.
If a hard fork has 75% user support and 75% miner support, the majority loses 25% of their hash power and 25% of their economy. The reduced network effect is a serious setback. *Maybe* some of those 25% will eventually see the error of their ways and start trickling back in, but it's far from guaranteed.

Even if segwit activates, it doesn't require legacy miners to change anything about the blocks they produce. They just won't be able to get the transaction fees from segwit transactions. Initially, there will still be plenty of legacy transactions for them to include in their blocks.

BIP148 starts out by rejecting blocks that don't signal for segwit activation, so that's when the chain split occurs.

At 33% the UASF chain will be completely immune. Even at lower percentages it'll be well-protected, because the attacker has to account for variance and for the possibility of other miners switching sides during the attack.

Core isn't going to sponsor that, for good reason. There are no paths forward that aren't contentious, so now it's a question of what changes can be implemented despite contention.
A UASF is far better than a hard fork because it can (and will, with enough economic support) result in a unified Bitcoin. A hard fork that doesn't have universal agreement will always result in two currencies, dividing the economy between them.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:54:25
Regardless of why, that 5% can still exist and remain compatible with the rest of the network. If segwit is activated via UASF, a much larger proportion of the mining power can potentially remain on legacy code.
Initially there may be enough legacy transactions available that there isn't much difference in income between segwit and legacy miners. Eventually they're likely to be squeezed out, but not right away.

Defining and measuring economic majority:
 What do you mean by "economic majority"?
An "economic majority of users" is a majority of users that is weighted by wealth or economic activity, as opposed to a numeric majority that counts everyone equally. BIP148's success is dependent on economic majority support. This majority would consist of:
* Bitcoin investors, or anyone who deliberately holds bitcoins instead of immediately selling them for fiat. In the event of a chain split, an investor will own coins on both sides of the split. They can sell the coins on the chain that they do not support in order to buy more coins on the chain that they do support. Doing this drives up the price on their favored chain, while driving the price on the other chain down. The more bitcoins an investor owns, the greater their contribution to the economic majority.
* Bitcoin merchants, or anyone willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for goods, services, or other currencies. In the event of a chain split, a merchant can choose to accept as payment only coins from the chain that they support. By making goods available, the merchant increases the value of their favored chain. The greater the aggregate value of goods sold by the merchant, the greater their contribution to the economic majority.
 How can we measure whether BIP148 has economic majority support?
There are multiple metrics to measure whether a proposal has the support of an economic majority. Some metrics are better than others.
* Counting nodes is a low-quality (but not irrelevant) metric. Mostly you can conclude that if there are very few nodes supporting a proposal, then there is a lack of support. Few nodes opposing a proposal would indicate a lack of opposition. Many nodes supporting or opposing doesn't necessarily mean much either way though.
* Statements from Bitcoin businesses are a better, but still somewhat fuzzy metric. You can weigh statements by the size of the businesses making them. You can also assume a certain level of agreement from their customers.
* Futures markets, such as the BCC/BCU tokens on Bitfinex, are probably the best way to measure support. The market would pay out in whichever coin type you had bet on, once the proposal goes into effect. This allows anyone who would want to buy or sell a particular coin after a split, to instead do so before the split occurs, thus establishing a price for each coin. In the case of BIP148, having a price above that of the legacy coin would mean that BIP148 will succeed.

Simply considering segwit active leaves you vulnerable to a malicious miner causing a chain split by mining a segwit-invalid transaction. You end up in the same situation as if you had just rejected all non-signalling blocks, as BIP148 does, but the split happens at some unpredictable time. With BIP148 everyone knows when the split is going to happen and can plan around it.

To clarify, a segwit-invalid transaction would be seen by legacy miners as non-standard, so wouldn't get mined by default. The person wanting to publish such a transaction either needs mining power of their own, or a miner actively helping them (for pay or otherwise). Not saying that it won't happen (it likely would), but it has to be a delibrate decision to do so by someone with access to mining power.


A hard fork will split the chain permanently unless everyone is on board with it. A minority hashpower soft fork will split the chain for only as long as it remains a hashpower minority. Additionally, if the soft fork starts with majority hashpower, there will be no split at all.
There's risk in both cases, but a hard fork is definitely more risky than a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:07:15
Why would they bother to hard fork? The ability to reorg the legacy chain is a strong advantage. Doing a separate hard fork after causing the split would give that up.
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:57:01
While I don't agree with the BIP16-style plan, it is better than a 55% BIP9, in the same way that BIP148 is better than making a new deployment of "segwit is active now" nodes.
A 55% BIP9 runs the risk of sliding back below 50% hashrate after segwit is locked in. This makes the network vulnerable to a malicious miner creating a block with a segwit-invalid transaction, causing a chain split. This would happen at some unknown, unpredictable time.
Actively orphaning blocks that don't signal for segwit activation forces *all* miners to upgrade to segwit-enforcing nodes. This pretty much eliminates any chances of backsliding down below 50%.
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:23:03
While you do have something of a point, the conflict of interest can't be ignored. Being invested in BTC means that your wealth is tied to its success. Being invested in ETH means that your wealth is tied to the success of a competitor. Taking action to cause harm to Bitcoin becomes a potential source of profit. Hopefully you would abstain from doing so, but the incentive is there.

51% isn't safely out of reorg range. Even at 60/40 there's a danger (due to variance) that the non-UASF chain gets wiped out by a reorg.

Coins on the BIP148 side of the split would be worth less than their main chain counterparts, so any mining power that the BIP148 side had would migrate back to the main chain, and the fork would be abandoned.
For the success scenario, just reverse all of the above, plus the main chain would get wiped out in a reorg once the BIP148 chain gained majority hash power and caught up.

It's a safer assumption than the opposite. ETC never had a higher price than ETH.


I was playing out the "miners respond to UASF by hard forking" scenario that you suggested. Did I misunderstand you? If not, then whatever hashrate you have on August 1st is what you'd be forking with.

Only if we accept your premise that hashrate is the leading indicator and price the lagging indicator.
Regardless, BU forking off isn't a problem for a UASF specifically, at least not any more than it would be for Bitcoin in general.

Incorrect. If segwit-enforcing miners don't have majority hashing power, attempting to claim a SW UTXO that doesn't belong to you would result in a chain split.
Segwit-enforcing nodes would follow the segwit-enforcing miners, legacy nodes would follow legacy miners. If the segwit side of the chain split ever becomes longer than the legacy side, the legacy side would be annihilated in a reorg, losing all of its transactions, and the entire network would then follow the segwit side.

It would be better to have a BIP148-specific futures market that pays out in whatever type of coin you bet on. The price of tokens on such a market on July 31st would tell us what the price of coins on each side of the split are likely to be on August 1st.

In the sense that non-BIP148 users would have sunk costs from transacting on the non-SF side of the chain split, sure. That's also an incentive to not use the non-SF chain in the first place, or to at least cut their losses.

The distinction between a hard fork and a soft fork is in what kind of changes to the consensus rules they introduce.
A hard fork changes the consensus rules to be more lax. Blocks made under the new rules will never be considered valid by old nodes, so a hard fork will always cause a permanent chain split.
A soft fork changes the consensus rules to be more strict. Blocks made under the new rules will always be considered valid by old nodes. A chain split can still occur if more than 50% of the mining power is still using the old validation rules, since they will produce and continue to build on blocks that the new nodes consider invalid. This split can be resolved if the fork side (re)gains the majority of the mining power. The non-fork side will be orphaned, and all nodes will follow the fork side, resulting in a single unified currency.

A futures market that pays out in the type of coin that you bet on (similar to BCC and BCU on Bitfinex) can measure economic majority support. It essentially allows you to buy and sell BIP148/legacy coins before the split actually happens, and thus establishes a price for them.

For the purposes of the futures market, it doesn't matter. After August 1st, each side of the market pays out whatever coin is available to pay out.
If BIP148 was abandoned before August 1st, the BIP148 side of the futures market pays out nothing. If it's abandonned after August 1st, that's no concern of the exchange, because they've already paid out the BIP148 coins and have fulfilled their obligation.
If BIP148 starts with majority hash power and there's no separate legacy chain, the legacy side of the futures market pays out nothing. If BIP148 starts with minority hash power and later gains majority, wiping the legacy chain out in a reorg, it's still no concern of the exchange, since they've already paid out the legacy coins and have fulfilled their obligation.
@_date: 2017-04-14 08:33:40


Nope. A UASF with economic majority support will keep the network together, because of backwards compatibility and the danger of holdouts having their transactions wiped. Once a certain level of support is attained, there's a snowball effect that draws in more and more of the holdouts until everyone is on board.
A hard fork is literally starting a new currency, using Bitcoin's existing ledger, and hoping that everyone joins in. If there's any disagreement, the result is going to be two currencies, with the economy divided between them. Also, unless you specifically make your changes mutually incompatible between the new ruleset and the old one, you have the danger of a wipeout working *against* you. The holdouts are in the safe position, while the defectors are in a dangerous one.


The early steps are informal, just generally putting the idea out there and rallying support from users and small businesses. As more of the economy joins, it becomes more enticing for larger businesses to pledge their support too.
A final step should be to set up a futures market for the UASF chain vs the legacy chain, should there be a split (similar to the BCC/BCU tokens on Bitfinex). The UASF side of the market will pay out in coins from the UASF chain after the flag date. The legacy side will pay out legacy coins after the flag date, but only if a split occurs.
As we get closer to the flag date, the prices of these tokens will converge on what the starting prices of the UASF and legacy coins will be. This gives us a final check on whether it's safe to proceed. If the price of the UASF token is the higher of the two, then that's the chain that profit-minded miners will follow, and the UASF will succeed. If the price of the legacy token is higher, then we pull the plug on the UASF project.
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:34:33


That's not any different than any other soft fork. Soft forks make the rules more restrictive, such that new blocks will be accepted by old clients, but not vice-versa.
Let's say, hypothetically, that for the segwit activation on Litecoin, 30% of the miners are signalling for activation, but not actually running segwit-enforcing nodes. 45% are genuinely segwit-enforcing. That meets the 75% requirement, so segwit gets activated.
Afterwards, if someone mines a segwit-invalid transaction, only 45% of the mining power will reject it, while 55% will accept. The network splits, with segwit nodes following segwit miners, and non-segwit nodes following non-segwit miners. The split will persist until the segwit side gains enough mining power to reorg the other chain.
The possiblity of this happening doesn't make the soft fork a hard fork. Soft forks do have risk, it's just a different kind of risk than a hard fork does. This is why Bitcoin has a 95% activation threshold for segwit. It would be nice if miners would just activate that, but since they won't, we're left with the less-optimal route of a UASF.


We have the advantage that the legacy chain will reorg into ours if it falls behind. At 33% hash rate, we're completely immune to a 51% attack, since the attacker would have to divert their hashing power from the legacy chain. If the attacker uses 34% of the total hash rate to attack us, that leaves the legacy chain with only 33%. Even at lower hash rates we're pretty well protected, because the attacker can't risk the legacy chain getting wiped out by variance.

It's still early on, so most companies haven't made any kind of statement. This project really got started in earnest with the Asicboost revelation. Smaller companies are likely to move first, and then as larger companies see more of the economy joining, they'll join too.
Businesses aren't actually stuck if BIP148 fails. If it doesn't look like we'll be able to succeed once July 31st rolls around, we'll be pulling the plug. If it looks like we are going to succeed but then something goes wrong later, businesses can start accepting legacy coins again. They'll still have the legacy coins that they started with as well.

You've got it backwards. Liquidity means that the commodity in question is easy to convert to cash. To have liquidity, you need people that are willing to buy it and hold on to it for investment or savings purposes. People playing hot-potato with it are the ones removing liquidity.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:28:47
Your opinion is unpopular because it's wrong. Bitcoin cannot be used as a currency without speculative investment first giving it some value.
If everyone is just playing hot-potato with it and trying to get rid of it as soon as possible, you won't have any liquidity to sustain trade. Merchants won't just have to worry about the price dropping before they're able to sell their coins; they'll have to worry about getting stuck with coins that they can't sell for *any* price for extended periods of time. Your darknet markets would have to go back to using cash in the mail for payments. For an indication of how well that worked, consider that you didn't know what a darknet market was before Bitcoin existed.
Investors (both short and long term) provide liquidity to Bitcoin, meaning that it can be easily converted to cash. The more investment, the more liquidity, the easier it is to convert, and the less the price slips when you buy or sell. As liquidity increases, new use-cases for Bitcoin get unlocked, since larger and larger transactions can be undertaken without sending the price whipsawing up and down.
So no, drug buyers are not doing more for Bitcoin than investors. Feel free to use Bitcoin for whatever you like, but stop shitting on the people that make that usage possible.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:03:24
Even if that were true and Silk Road were first, that would just mean that early merchants would be acting as speculative investors.

To be clear, this needs to be done after 2x activates, but before you make any other transactions.
If 2x implements the opt-in replay protection that they've discussed, and if your wallet supports it, using that is probably the easiest method. You'd have to send all of your BTC to another address that you control. The replay protection should stop that transaction from being copied to the 2x chain. After that transaction confirms, use a 2x wallet to send all your 2x coins to a different address that you control.
Note that this must be done in the correct order, BTC first, then 2x. Opt-in replay protection is only one-way. If you send the 2x coins first, the transaction is likely to be replayed to the Bitcoin chain.
If 2x doesn't implement opt-in replay protection, or if your wallet doesn't support it, the next best method is to obtain some coins that were mined after the 2x fork activated, and use the "taint method" to do the split. You can use newly-mined coins from either chain, but let's say for the sake of example that they're 2x coins. They'll only exist on the 2x chain, and not on the Bitcoin chain.
Once you've obtained the newly-mined 2x coins, use your 2x wallet to create a transaction that sends all of your existing coins plus the newly-mined ones to a new address that you control. Since the new coins don't exist on the Bitcoin chain, this transaction will only be valid on the 2x chain, and can't be replayed. After it confirms, use your Bitcoin wallet to send all of your BTC to another new address that you control.

* We need time to study the effects of segwit's block size increase on node/miner centralization.
* We should find out how Lightning will affect the demand for block space before increasing the block size.
* There are optimizations that can give us increased transaction throughput at current block sizes; we should exhaust those before increasing the block size.

They would have to take specific, coordinated action, essentially creating a competing soft-fork that's mutually incompatible with the segwit UASF. The UASF chain gaining the lead would still cause anyone who didn't update their node to be swept up in the reorg.
One of the big advantages of soft forks over hard forks in general is that soft forks include neutral/apathetic/ignorant parties by default, while hard forks exclude them. This makes soft forks much easier to organize, as you don't have to deal with the problem of shedding a chunk of the economy if not everyone updates.

The Bitcoin protocol *can't* require replay protection. By what mechanism would it do so?
Bcash has replay protection, so that Bcash transactions aren't valid on Bitcoin, and Bitcoin transactions aren't valid on Bcash. However, if I were to create a new fork off of Bcash (let's call it "Bbucks"), there's nothing forcing me to implement RP. Even though there's RP between Bcash and Bitcoin, if I don't also implement RP on Bbucks, then Bbucks transactions will be valid on Bcash, and vice-versa.


Why would anyone not care about coins on the other side of the fork, regardless of which side they favor? If you lose them, you can't sell them.
The lack of replay protection is at the very least an attack against SPV wallet users. Garzik and company want to force SPV wallets onto the 2x chain without the knowledge or consent of the users of those wallets. Replay protection would prevent that from happening.

If you fork Bitcoin, creating a separate blockchain (let's call it "Bfork"), transactions intended for the original Bitcoin blockchain will also be valid on the Bfork copy, and vice-versa. This is a problem, because if you try to spend some of your Bfork coins, the transaction can be copied ("replayed") to the Bitcoin blockchain. This causes your bitcoins to move as well, even if you didn't want them to.
Replay protection means changing the transaction format on the new blockchain to be mutually incompatible with the original. With replay protection, Bitcoin transactions won't be accepted by the Bfork blockchain, and Bfork transactions won't be accepted by the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows you to spend your coins independently on each chain without affecting the other.

Carefully split your 2x coins off from your BTC so that you don't get replayed, then sell your 2x coins for more BTC.
Note that if you don't feel confident in your ability to perform the split, just sit tight and don't risk your BTC. A bird in the hand, etc etc.

Do you mean that you want a further block size increase beyond what segwit already provides? 100% segwit utilization will result in blocks that are about 2mb on average. We're already seeing blocks that are bigger than the old 1mb limit.
Some have objected that the rate of segwit adoption is too slow to provide the needed capacity, but fees are pretty low as is. It's possible to confirm transactions with a fee of 1 satoshi per byte, and sometimes even zero-fee transactions.
If a demand spike were to drive fees up, that would increase the pressure to adopt segwit sooner rather than later. This is possibly why we're no longer seeing [large amounts of spam transactions](
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:18:53


That doesn't make sense. Segwit is not some sort of "separate container" for block data. There's no 1mb limit anymore, just the 4mwu limit.


* Fees are extremely low right now with ~1mb blocks, *and* we have room to grow
* [Doubling the block size is not safe](
* Hard forking on this timeframe is not safe
* Hard forking in the face of opposition (due to the other concerns) is not safe

It is this way. Like the 51% attack vulnerability, it's not something that can be designed around.


A bunch of exchanges released a [statement]( a while back that they wouldn't list any fork coin that didn't include replay protection. This is a good approach to take, but it seems like the NYA signatories among them are making an exception for 2x. On the other hand, maybe they actually do require RP, and just haven't gotten around to reining Garzik in.

According to basic morality. Can we agree that it's wrong to steal, even if you can get away with it? If so, is depriving someone of their property through deception not also wrong?


And many would be incorrect. On August 22nd, when Bcash gained majority hash power, did it become Bitcoin? I had already sold off my BCH. Did my remaining BTC become some other, non-Bitcoin currency?
I'm not talking about the name, here, but about the thing itself. Branding is a separate issue. If I'm using a wallet for currency X, it should always deal with that currency, by using that currency's blockchain, not switch to currency Y without me knowing about it.
If that wallet has a security flaw that allows X to be switched for Y without my knowledge, then exploiting that flaw is an attack, and is wrong. Perhaps I should be using a more secure wallet (maybe a full node?), but that doesn't change the fact that taking advantage of my vulnerability is wrong.

I'm not referring to segwit vs non-segwit transactions. Both are valid.
If you use a SPV (simplified payment verification) wallet, such as what runs on most phones, you're not able to fully validate the blockchain. When the 2x fork occurs, if it has majority hash power, your SPV wallet may start following the 2x blockchain instead of the Bitcoin blockchain. If someone sends you a 2x coin at that point, it will look like a bitcoin to your wallet, and it'll be possible to rip you off.
Full nodes are immune to this.

@_date: 2017-09-29 05:12:07
The lack of replay protection is at the very least an attack against SPV wallet users. Garzik and company want to force SPV wallets onto the 2x chain without the knowledge or consent of the users of those wallets. Replay protection would prevent that from happening.
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:41:29
Breadwallet is an SPV wallet. It doesn't download the entire blockchain, just a small portion of each block. This is different from pruning, where the entire blockchain is downloaded and fully verified, but parts of it are discarded as they are verified.

When people talk about "splitting" Bitcoin, they're talking about forking the blockchain, essentially creating another copy of it. The copy isn't like a stock split. It's a separate currency in its own right, and will have a different valuation than the original currency.
A stock split would be more like extending the number of decimal places that you can use in Bitcoin transactions. Currently a bitcoin consists of 100 million satoshis. If the BTC value ever got high enough that a satoshi was too large for day to day transactions, we could modify the protocol to allow for smaller units. Perhaps we could make it so that a satoshi consists of 100 million "finneys".

It's not obvious, though I was able to pick it up from context. At full utilization, segwit blocks will be 2mb on average, so it's important to differentiate. If you'd said, "I want 2x, maintained by Core!", it would have been more clear.

Eh, I guess there's a marginal benefit in that sense. The problem is that it's easy to counter.
As far as I'm aware, SPV (light) wallets connect to multiple nodes, not just one. You'd have to seriously outnumber the 2x nodes in order to prevent most SPV wallets from connecting to them. Full nodes will reject blocks from the other side of the fork, but SPV wallets can't. They'll just follow the longest block chain that they know about.

Contact the companies that you do business with and tell them that you oppose 2x. Companies ultimately have to follow their customers. Additionally, as more parties to the NYA back out of it, it increases the incentive for the others to back out as well. We're already seeing this happen.


Some sort of block size increase is likely at some point in the future, but it shouldn't be done prematurely. We need to study the effect of segwit's block size increase on node/miner centralization. We should also wait and see how Lightning and other second-layer protocols affect demand for block space. Additionally, there are further optimizations we can make to increase capacity before we consider a further increasing the block size.
In the meantime, we may find a better way of increasing the block size than doing a hard fork. The extension blocks concept might be developed enough to use, so that we can stick to backwards-compatible changes.

The majority of existing bitcoins aren't currently available for sale. The buyer could in theory wipe out the order books on each exchange. This would entice some bitcoin owners to send their coins to exchanges and offer them at the new absurdly-inflated prices established by the buyer. This process would repeat until the buyer runs out of money.
At no point would the buyer succeed in obtaining all of the existing bitcoins. There will always be hold-outs and people who are unaware that the buy-out is occurring. There are also new bitcoins being mined every 10 minutes.
If the buyer is a government, they could print more money in order to finance this project. However, even this has limits. They would eventually destroy their currency through hyperinflation if they persisted.

SPV is "simplified payment verification". Most phone wallets use SPV. An SPV wallet downloads only the headers of blocks, and verifies that they are valid and have the highest total difficulty available. Once the headers are verified, the wallet requests transactions matching the user's addresses from the nodes that it's connected to.
An SPV wallet does not download/verify all of the transactions in each block. A block containing an invalid transaction is invalid, even if its header is valid. They also have no way to check that a block doesn't exceed the size limit.
SPV security relies on the majority of mining power remaining honest. When 2x activates, this may no longer hold. If 2x has the majority hash rate, and you end up connected to at least one 2x node, your wallet will follow the 2x blockchain. At that point, if someone sends you a 2x coin, you won't be able to distinguish it from a bitcoin, leaving you open to being ripped off.


They are safe until they try to transact. If they try to send BTC, they may end up sending 2x coins instead (or additionally). If they accept a payment, it may be 2x coins instead of BTC.

Open source/internet engineering generally operates on the principle of "rough consensus and running code", but not necessarily unanimity. If a proposal fails to gain consensus, it doesn't pass, and we fall back on the status quo.


If they don't want to be called attackers, they should design their fork in such a way that it doesn't qualify as an attack. It's not hard; Bitcoin Cash did it just fine. If they won't do that, then fuck them, they're attackers and will be treated as such.

This is a major assumption, and likely wrong. Bitcoin investors don't need to be constantly transacting. They can just wait out the congestion and let the striking miners bleed money.

You're thinking of wipeout protection, not replay protection. Neither chain is able to "absorb" the other.
Lack of replay protection just makes things messy and puts users at risk of losing funds on one chain when they transact on the other.

Bitcoin Core 0.15 is fine to use. No version of Core supports 2x. The 2x software is "btc1".

@_date: 2017-09-27 21:35:07
In theory, yes. The ledger (UTXO set) will be the same on both chains at the point where the fork happens.
The problem is that 2x currently has no replay protection, which means that transactions on one chain are valid on the other. This means your coins are effectively "stuck together", and sending coins on one chain will cause them to also be sent on the other.
It's possible to split your coins so that you can send them independently, but it's somewhat complicated, and not obvious.

Miner coinbase messages are *under*whelming. They'll mine the most profitable coin.


And yet 2x supporters have been extremely reluctant to make 1:1 swaps for their supposedly favored coin. Meanwhile Bitcoin supporters are chomping at the bit for these trades.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:07:25
Miners can say anything they want. It demonstrates nothing until they actually start hashing. Kind of like how 2x supporters can crow a lot, but when it actually comes time to buy the coins, they won't do it.
There's been an abundance of offers by Bitcoin supporters to trade 2x for BTC at 1:1. If you can find any 2x supporters willing to trade, please point them out, because I want to take them up on the offer.
If any 2x supporters believed that 2x were going to trade higher than BTC after the fork, they would see this as an amazing deal. The fact that they're not going for it demonstrates that they have no such confidence.

In reply to your edit, if you're going to run Core make sure you have enough system resources for it. It's pretty heavy. I'd recommend reading this: 
Coins are held by "private keys", which are managed by your wallet program. These keys are what allow you to spend the coins. Each Bitcoin address has a private key associated with it.
You can make backups of the keys. Bitcoin Core stores them in a file called `wallet.dat`. Note that copying the keys doesn't copy the coins per se; any copy of a key can spend the coins that it holds, but the coins can only be spent once.
If you're storing the coins yourself, you'll need to make sure that your computer is secure. If a hacker or virus gets access to your `wallet.dat` file, they'll be able to spend your coins. This is why hardware wallets are a good idea, since they provide a specialized secure environment for coin storage. If you don't want to spend the money on a hardware wallet, but are willing to engage in some technical fuckery, "paper wallets" are a free option.

Before the fork:
Contact Bitcoin businesses that you deal with and voice your opposition to 2x. The more NYA participants we can get to drop out, the more incentive there is for the rest to defect as well. [Current status here.](
After the fork:
Sell your 2x coins for more BTC. This will drive the price of 2x down and BTC up, making BTC more attractive to miners. If 2x can't maintain a higher price, then all the doom and gloom scenarios that 2x supporters are painting for Bitcoin will happen to 2x instead.
Before you send them anywhere, split your BTC and 2x coins so that you don't lose any to replay. The best method for doing this may change, so look it up when we get closer to the fork date.

Also, if there's excess demand for BTC at 1:1, that means BTC should end up with a higher price post fork. Excess demand for 2x indicates the opposite. Whichever chain maintains a higher price will end up with the majority of mining power.

The idea that using a full node helps "secure the network" is mostly a myth. A full node secures your transactions.
To contrast, if you use an SPV wallet (the kind on most phones), you can end up following a forked chain instead of the Bitcoin blockchain. If this happens, when you receive fork coins, your wallet won't know that they're not actual bitcoins. You can be ripped off by accepting a payment this way.
A full node is immune to this, since it will only ever follow the Bitcoin blockchain.

I don't think dealing only in segwit transactions necessarily indicates anything about your position on 2x. Running a full node does protect you from shenanigans, and running a 0.15+ node does indicate that you've chosen to stick with Core instead of switching to btc1.
You should also contact any Bitcoin businesses that you deal with and voice your opposition to 2x. The best way to kill this thing before it gets off the ground is to pull its current supporters away from it. The more of them defect, the stronger the incentive is for the remainder to also bail.

@_date: 2017-10-11 16:41:19
That's true. The first 2x block could be delayed by a few minutes if there aren't enough transactions in the mempool. Keep in mind that 2x nodes will have a separate mempool at that point. Transactions getting included in Bitcoin blocks won't remove them from the 2x mempool.
Alternatively, 2x miners could just create some filler transactions (spending to themselves) to artificially increase the size of the first block past Bitcoin's limit.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:52:10
That's rich, considering that you guys are going to be fraudulently passing off 2x coins as BTC.

You're not risking anything by voting. It doesn't match how the market dynamics actually play out. In the event of a fork, a smaller faction that's willing to take risks has more influence than a larger risk-averse faction. Roger Ver can throw his stack of coins down on every vote that takes place, but if he's not actually willing to risk them, he's entirely irrelevant.

Outside enemies are more effective if they disguise themselves as supporters, or bribe certain high-reputation supporters to spread their influence. There's also people who are technically supporters, but seek special treatment for themselves at the expense of everyone else.
Granted, it's entirely possible to go overboard with paranoia and start believing everyone who disagrees with you is an enemy. There's a delicate balance to be maintained. It also helps to stick to principle and technical soundness, rather than pushing unity for unity's sake. Those who push technically unsound changes might be enemies, might be rent-seekers, or might just be genuinely mistaken. Regardless, we shouldn't give in to their demands.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:19:00
Yes, but beware of replay. Sending coins on one chain can cause the corresponding coins on the other chain to also move. There are ways to break this linkage, so you can look up the best method for doing it as we get closer to the fork date.
This wasn't a problem with Bcash because they implemented replay protection, something that the 2x developer is currently refusing to do.

Full nodes are for the most part only helpful if you actually use them to transact. Using a full node will allow you to stay on the correct blockchain, and verify that all payments you receive are actual bitcoins, not fork coins.
The primary benefit to the network is that if you can't be tricked into accepting counterfeit coins, there's less incentive to perform such an attack in the first place.

@_date: 2017-10-04 08:23:24
It's not segwit users that would be in danger, it would be those on pre-segwit nodes. If a miner were to produce a block that illegally spends a segwit UTXO, it would cause a chain split. All segwit nodes and miners would reject the block, and carry on operating as normal.
Pre-segwit nodes would follow the chain with the segwit-invalid transaction. They'd be susceptible to accepting these counterfeit coins, as well as to having their transactions wiped out once the segwit chain achieves majority hash power.
The UASF strategy is sound. If you allow enough time for most of the network to upgrade before the flag date, miners will play ball. The only difficulty that BIP148 faced was the short timeframe we had to work with, due to the segwit activation timeout.

Whether you see it as pragmatic or not, small blockers aren't ever going to accept 2x. We have a fundamentally different evaluation of how Bitcoin should work than you do.
Isn't that the point of Bitcoin Cash splitting off in the first place? So that big blockers can put their ideas into practice without being hindered by small blockers, and vice-versa?

2x nodes require the activation block to have a block weight greater than 4mwu, so that it's not valid to Bitcoin nodes. This ensures that the split happens, and also provides them with wipeout protection by making the chains mutually incompatible.

@_date: 2017-09-30 03:25:06
Not exactly. You're correct that for legacy transactions, their weight is 4 times their size, so a block consisting only of legacy transactions is still 1mb.
However, segwit transactions weigh less for a given size. A block consisting only of segwit transactions would be around 2mb. That's actual data size, not some sort of compression to fit more transactions into a 1mb block.
We're already seeing [blocks that are larger than the old 1mb limit]( This is possible because when a segwit node transmits a block to an old non-segwit node, it strips the signatures off of the segwit transactions first, resulting in a block that is within the 1mb limit required by the old node.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:30:24
These swaps matter because they're a form of futures market. We get to see in advance which chain is likely to win. If there's an excess of demand for the BTC side, it shows that BTC is likely to end up priced higher than 2x. Whichever chain has the higher price will also get the bulk of the mining power.
So far it looks like we're winning.

No, generally not. Forks of open source projects don't occur every time there's a disagreement. We don't create a new, competing internet every time someone raises an objection at the IETF.


Using 51%+ mining power to compromise SPV wallet security is definitely an attack. This isn't controversial to anyone who isn't desperately defending 2x.


You have an obligation not to steal, even if you see that someone has left their house unlocked.


The existing chain has no ability to implement replay protection. It is actually impossible. It's a change that can only be made by the forking chain.


If you have 51%+ percent of the mining power backing up your chain, then you have an obligation to do something to prevent the original chain's SPV wallets from following yours. Replay protection is one option.


You'd better spend some more time thinking this one through. Lack of replay protection doesn't absolutely stop everyone from separating their coins; there's no guarantee that any particular transaction will get replayed.

I'm not certain, but I wouldn't assume there would be any effect on the chances of connecting to a 2x node.

I'm not really interested in rehashing big blocker vs small blocker talking points anymore. It's been done to death.
If you have confidence that 2x will succeed, getting 2x coins at 1:1 should be a great deal. If you don't see it as a +EV trade, that means you think it's more likely that the original Bitcoin will prevail.
And if you don't have confidence in it, why would you expect anyone else to back it in order to make it happen?
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:47:59
1:1 is the ratio that matters. There's been a sustained propaganda campaign to convince people that 2x will win out and the original Bitcoin chain will no longer be usable. If that were going to be the case, 2x futures would be trading much higher than BTC futures. If 2x can't even attain parity, it's not going to be able to hold on to significant mining power.

Another myth.  :)
0.15 will ban any btc1 (2x) nodes that end up connected to it. Of course, 2x supporters threw a shit fit over this, and anti-2x folks got all giddy.
The purpose of the banning isn't to punish btc1 nodes or try to disrupt the 2x network; in fact it's the opposite. When the fork happens, any btc1 nodes (or pockets of nodes) that are only connected to Core nodes will end up isolated from the rest of the 2x network. They won't be able to receive any 2x blocks, and will ban any nodes that send them Bitcoin blocks.
Having 0.15 nodes ban btc1 nodes allows the network topology to change gradually as people upgrade. btc1 nodes will end up connected to each other and to a slowly shrinking number of pre-0.15 nodes. There will always be some older nodes available to act as a bridge up until the fork. Once the fork activates, the two networks will separate much more cleanly.

Don't worry, Bitcoin will survive and 2x will fail. It's just a question of how much of a mess it makes in the process.

It can't "become Bitcoin". It could outcompete Bitcoin (when hell freezes over) and take the top spot among cryptocurrencies, but it's still a distinctly separate thing.


I am absolutely willing to take the risk that 2x somehow wins out. I will be dumping every single 2x coin I own as soon as possible. If I feel nervous about Bitcoin's prospects at the time, I'll turn some of the 2x into USD.

I don't think there's anything wrong with Core devs being involved in other businesses. It does create the potential for conflict of interest, but they're not necessarily going to act on that conflict. It's more important that we are able to keep them in check if they misbehave.
To be clear, I don't object to having multiple node implementations, but I don't think having only a single implementation is automatically dangerous.
That's one of the things that bothers me about the mentality of "we must go along with 2x because it was agreed upon" or "we must go with 2x because that's what The Powers That Be have decided" (not saying that all 2x supporters think this way, but it's present). We as users need to be actively keeping the miners, businesses, and devs in check. We have more power than most of us realize.

~~Not sure about Crypto Facilities specifically, but~~ the [statement]( signed by a bunch of exchanges back in March requires "strong two-way replay protection", which means that transactions on either chain are always protected from replay.
2x has merged weak one-way replay protection, which means that users need to take specific action to protect each of their transactions from replay, and it only works on one chain. Their implementation is also an [ugly hack]( designed to bloat the Bitcoin blockchain, so it's overtly hostile.

Additional forks compete with each other far more than they compete with Bitcoin. People who aren't inclined to buy Bcash (through deception or conscious choice) aren't likely to buy Bgold either.

For 2x to succeed, it needs to maintain a higher market price than BTC, so that it can hold on to mining power. If 2x supporters actually believe that's going to happen, then 1:1 is a good deal for them. If they don't see 1:1 as a good deal, it's because they fear 2x will flop.

If you keep the same PoW, have 51%+ mining power, and don't otherwise make your fork incompatible with existing SPV wallets, then yes, it's an attack.
The SPV security model is dependent on the majority of mining power remaining honest. If the majority of miners go forward with 2x, they're no longer being honest. Though to be fair, they haven't stated explicitly that they approve of Garzik's implementation; perhaps they'll require him to fix it.

The mempool effectively becomes separate once 2x nodes start rejecting Bitcoin blocks, after block 494783. A transaction needs to be included in a 2x block in order to remove it from the 2x mempool.
Lack of replay protection just means that a transaction can be copied from the Bitcoin mempool to the 2x mempool, or vice-versa.

No, the blocks are actually larger than 1mb. There are fancy tricks done to get older nodes to accept them despite the 1mb limit.
[This recent block]( is 1037kb. Currently about 5% of transactions use segwit. At 100% segwit usage, blocks will be around 2mb on average. Actual data size, not somehow compressing 2mb of transactions into a 1mb block.

I don't think there's much point in setting up the trade if it's going to be anulled by 2x flopping. It screws up the signalling. 2x not launching at all is effectively the same as it launching with a coin price of zero.

* It's "design by political compromise", which is terrible engineering practice.
* We just did a block size increase with segwit, we don't need another one.
* It's a rushed hard fork, which made very little attempt to gain user consensus; consensus is critical for a successful hard fork.
* We need time to study the effects of segwit's block size increase on node/miner centralization.
* We should find out how Lightning will affect the demand for block space before increasing the block size.
* There are optimizations that can give us increased transaction throughput at current block sizes; we should exhaust those before increasing the block size.
* The project's developer refuses to implement replay protection, so that SPV wallets (the kind of most phones) can be forced onto the 2x chain without the users' knowledge or consent.

There's certainly a level of BIP148 hash rate at which, if it isn't growing, it will shrink to nothing. We were talking about 30%, though. At 15% (stable or growing), the BIP148 chain has a decent chance of winning in the long term. At 30%, it's a done deal and the legacy chain is doomed.
The majority can only ignore the minority if the minority is below the level of unsustainability. Otherwise, the individual members of the majority must factor in the odds of some of their number defecting, and what the effects of that will be.
The minority also has an outsize influence on the price of both chains. As the more radical, risk-tolerant group, they're more willing to dump their legacy coins to buy more BIP148 coins. The majority is more risk-averse, and more likely to hold onto both types of coins until the situation is resolved. A portion of the majority will also likely exit from Bitcoin entirely during this time, further reducing the majority's influence.




All legacy blocks and all of their transactions since the split discarded, and all legacy nodes now following the BIP148 chain.




Any coins that they received or mined on the legacy chain will disappear, since those blocks and transactions were discarded. If they've sold their BIP148 coins to buy more legacy coins (to mirror the stubborn BIP148 supporters), they'll end up completely broke.


Yes, this entire conversation has been premised on a chain split occurring and there being a competition between the BIP148 side of the split and the legacy side of the split.
I've been trying to get you to understand the asymmetry of that competition. It's not like the short splits and reorgs that occur during the normal operation of the Bitcoin network. With those, either side of the split can win, causing the other side to be reorg'ed away.
The BIP148 side of the split cannot be reorg'ed away, it can only be voluntarily abandoned. The legacy side can be reorg'ed away, even against the will of nearly half of the network.

The Bitcoin payment system has a unique set of desirable features that are not fully available to any other previously-existing payment system (irreversiblity, psudonymity, unfreezability, etc). In order to use the Bitcoin system to make payments and take advantage of those features, you have to first acquire the system's tokens (bitcoins).
Once a baseline demand and value for the tokens has been established, further demand is driven by the [network effect]( The more people there are using the system, the more useful it becomes; and as it becomes more useful, it draws in more users that had not been interested before, further compounding the effect.

No one is really sure at this point. We could end up with a long-lasting chain split, with prices on both sides in a death spiral.

When BIP148 trading opens, the order book will initially be empty, while the price of legacy BTC drops due to the uncertainty. People mostly won't place orders that allow for massive arbitrage profits between the BTC/USD, 148/USD, and 148/BTC trading pairs.

This is in fact the only option for activating segwit without waiting another year and a half. A whole lot of people are not willing to put up with that kind of delay, which is why ignoring BIP148 and hoping it goes away isn't an option.
The flag day was going to be October 1st in the original version of BIP148. Due to the way that BIP9 works, the flag day had to be moved to August 1st in order to avoid potential failure from a sustained loss of mining power.

Segwit is incredibly well-tested, and the BIP148 code is extremely simple.
BIP148 activating is also inevitable at this point. You should support it because it gets safer as it gains more support. The likelihood of a chain split is lessened, and any split that does occur will be shorter. It also puts pressure on miners to activate segwit before August 1st.

The fact that the legacy chain can be wiped out by the BIP148 chain will push down the price of legacy coins. The more mining power switches over, the bigger the risk premium becomes, causing still more miners to switch. At 51% the game is over, but even before that (probably around 30%) there's going to be severe panic on the legacy side.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:43:23


I'm a [BIP148 hardliner]( and I understand exactly what I'm advocating. Feel free to pick my brain if you like.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:30:34
No one can be certain that the BIP148 chain will not achieve majority hash rate. The closer it gets to 51%, the greater the risk. People mining, holding, and trading legacy coins factor that risk into their appraisal of what the coins are worth.
1. Risk goes up, demand goes down
2. Demand goes down, price drops
3. Price drops, risk goes up
4. Repeat
If it still doesn't make sense, imagine a scenario where the BIP148 chain has 49% of the hash rate. It's still technically in the minority, but do you think everyone on the legacy chain will just carry on as usual?
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:49:04
Separate deployment? I call shenanigans. BIP148 is already available if they want to activate segwit with less than 95% mining power.
I'm guessing they want to modify segwit to not interfere with Asicboost, and to distribute a Bitcoin client that has the hardfork activation code already built into it.

That tool isn't magic; you still need to have more hash power than the chain that you're attacking. If:
* the BIP148 chain has 33% of the global hash rate; and
* the attacker has 34% of the global hash rate; that means
* the legacy chain only has 33% of the global hash rate.
Since the attacker has more hash power dedicated to attacking the BIP148 chain than is left on the legacy chain, eventually the attacker's version of the BIP148 chain will become longer than the legacy chain. Once that happens, the legacy chain will be destroyed in a reorg, and all the legacy nodes will start following the BIP148 chain.
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:14:28

With the exception of Blockstream is not involved with BIP148. We do invite them to support it, however.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:35:32
We'll dump our legacy coins to crash the price and buy more BIP148 coins, driving their price up. Legacy supporters will largely be too conservative to take the opposite position (or [unable to figure out how to split their coins]( so the BIP148 price will rise above the legacy price.
At this point, profit-maximizing miners will start switching over to the BIP148 chain in order to increase their income. As the BIP148 hashrate grows and the legacy hashrate shrinks, users on the legacy side will get more nervous and start selling their legacy coins for BIP148, increasing BIP148's price lead. More miners will then switch over, and so on.
This cycle will continue until BIP148 has the majority hash rate. The stragglers will then be in full panic mode, rushing to dump their legacy coins for any price that they can still get before the legacy chain falls behind the BIP148 chain and gets destroyed in a reorg.

That's true, and still helps. Fear of BIP148 tanking the price puts pressure on miners to activate segwit early, either through the normal BIP9 (95%) mechanism, or through something like segsignal (basically early BIP148 done by miners). With enough pressure, even Jihan will get in line.
Note that you wouldn't be able to double your money by selling both sides of the split, though. Once the split occurs, the combined price of each coin will be equal to or less than the BTC price before the split.

That won't help them. It still leaves all of the passive legacy nodes vulnerable to re-org. If you're suggesting that *everyone* switch to node software that rejects BIP148, then *everyone* may as well just switch to BIP148 and actually gain the benefits of segwit.

The risks of BIP148 are more to Bitcoin as a whole than to it's individual supporters. Holding bitcoins leaves you exposed to that risk, so the least personally risky option would probably be to sell for USD until the situation is resolved.


I genuinely think we're past the point of no return. I was in the moderate camp (and even ready to give up) a few weeks ago. Since then I've flipped to being a hardliner, because I don't think we have any other option now.

We'll find out that support was sufficient when segwit activates without any issues. If support wasn't sufficient, we'll still have segwit, but also a giant chaotic mess. It's up to the miners and other stragglers which outcome we end up with, but either way we'll have segwit active.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:56:28

At 30% hash power, the BIP148 side will have effectively already won. At 51% the legacy chain will *cease to exist*, so 30% is enough to trigger a panicked rush of users and miners abandoning the legacy chain.

Good. You're proving my point.


We're only in this situation because there's so much demand for segwit in the first place. These arguments wouldn't apply if it were an unpopular change. On top of that, BIP9 likely won't be used to implement protocol changes ever again, so this situation is fairly unique.


They won't. Even if you were to somehow convince me to drop it (likely involving a gun to my head), that won't stop the rest of the fanatics. We're locked into our current course. The only choice you have is whether to join in and help mitigate the risks, or stay out and make them worse.

We're not backing down at this point. It doesn't make any sense to do so from a game theory perspective. BIP148 is going to happen, it's just a question of how disruptive it will be. At this point the safer option is for everyone to support it in order to make the transition as smooth as possible.

So you're going to accept payments through your node that follows the legacy chain? The legacy chain that's going to be annihilated in a reorg? Good luck with that.
On the other hand, if you're not using your node to accept payments, then your node is irrelevant.

At 10x the block size, the average transaction fee would have to be at least 50 cents for miners to prefer them over smaller blocks with $5 average transaction fees. In order for 5 cent transaction fees to be preferable to miners, you'd need 100x the block size.

This is incorrect. The split is entirely reconcilable. The danger for the legacy side of the chain split is that reconciliation involves wiping out all of the legacy blocks/transactions since the split and replacing them with the BIP148 side.
This asymmetry gives BIP148 a massive advantage. It's too risky to really commit to the legacy chain, so BIP148 supporters will face very little actual resistance. The detractors can't do much beyond "wait and see" (and whine).

No miners whatsoever is unlikely, though I guess theoretically possible. There's been talk of doing a PoW change in that case, but I think a coordinated sell-off would be the better option as a credible threat. If the price crashes hard, miners will be left with a whole lot of unprofitable hardware.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:28:02




Yes, they will. Your node will follow the rules of the Bitcoin network which are coded into it, which includes following the longest valid chain. Once the BIP148 chain becomes the longest, your node will follow that. If you then produce a BIP148-invalid block, the BIP148 miners (now a majority) will reject it and it will be orphaned.


That's a risky action to take, since they don't know which will prevail. The majority are risk-averse, while the minority is risk-tolerant. You can't just hand-wave the asymmetry away. You keep assuming that the BIP148 miners will stop supporting it, regardless of the incentives actually in play.

We're gaining more support every day, and there's still two months to go. Transactions on the BIP148 chain might be a little slow at first, but that's fine. The legacy chain being faster will make it easier to dump.

Hashrate attacks divert hash power away from the legacy chain, which it needs to survive. If the BIP148 chain has 33%+ of the global hash power, it's completely immune. Even at lower hash rates, the attacker is taking a huge risk and paying a lot of money, so while such attacks are possible, they're not likely.

You've got it backwards. The snowball rolls downhill, not uphill.
If the BIP148 hashrate gets above 50% and stays there, the legacy chain and all of its transactions will be wiped out in a block reorg.
At 35% hashrate, the BIP148 chain would present a severe existential threat to the legacy chain. This risk would push the price of legacy coins down, causing even more miners to switch over in order to maintain their income.

I recognize that measurements of how many people support it are going to be fuzzy at best. There has been an unmistakable steady increase, though.


I don't consider the Barry Accord to be particularly stable. I think it's likely to fall apart before August.
That said, it seems that Jeff Garzik has conceded that frankensegwit should be made compatible with the existing BIP141 deployment, and will activate BIP91 style. If he follows through on this, frankensegwit will ironically be dependent on pressure from BIP148 in order to succeed. Without that pressure, Jihan would likely flake out and deny frankensegwit the 80% hashrate that it needs. He may still flake regardless, so we'll need BIP148 as a backup plan.


I'm well aware. I don't particularly *like* that it's come to this, but I feel it necessary.

I agree that there's no point for Bitcoin users to try to destroy alternative blockchains.  However, the existence of viable competitors would not help, and in fact would hurt the cryptocurrency economy.
The value of bitcoins is based on the belief that they are limited in number.  A viable competitor would undermine this belief, as it would demonstrate that that value can be inflated away by simply creating new blockchains.  Fortunately no competitor has achieved viability, and Bitcoin's [network effect]( should be enough to prevent this from happening.

Assuming BIP91 locks in, you'll be fine for now. The Segwit2x folks are planning to attempt a hard fork in 3 months. Assuming they don't back down before then, there will be a chain split.
Users won't follow the hard fork chain by default, and many are explicitly opposed to it. Which chain prevails will be dependent on what users choose to do.
When the split happens, you'll have coins on both sides. The only thing you need to potentially worry about at that point are replay attacks, where your transactions on one side of the split get copied onto the other side in order to move those coins as well. I'm not sure if BTC1 has implemented or will implement replay protection to prevent this.

This is extremely unlikely. A hashrate attack against BIP148 would be expensive and have a high risk of backfiring. It would require diverting hashrate from the legacy chain, but the legacy chain needs to maintain enough hash rate to not be wiped out in a reorg.
At 33% of total hash power, the BIP148 chain would be completely immune to hash rate attacks, and it's likely to be relatively safe against them even at lower amounts.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:00:49


[The risk of a chain split is what makes this strategy work.]( In the end the majority will join in, because that's the only way to reduce the risk.


The reason we can force the change is because of the massive demand for segwit. Nearly everyone wants what we're offering, they're just apprehensive about the method of getting it.

Incorrect. BIP148 nodes see the legacy chain as invalid and will never follow it, so the BIP148 chain can never be wiped out by the legacy chain. Legacy nodes see the BIP148 chain as valid, and will follow it if it ever becomes the longest chain, discarding the legacy chain.


At a static 30%, the BIP148 chain would continue to function indefinitely, with the only downside being slower blocks until the first difficulty adjustment. Miners have no incentive to switch back over to the legacy chain, because it may spontaneously cease to exist, taking their mining rewards (which are locked for 100 blocks after generation) with it.


Even ignoring the fact that the legacy chain could die at that point just from a long enough string of bad luck, the miners remaining on the legacy chain would have a massive incentive to defect. Any one of them controlling more than 1% would be able to open short positions on the legacy coin, and then switch their hash power over. The BIP148 chain would then have majority hash power, and it would only be a matter of time before it becomes the longer chain and destroys the legacy chain. The price of the legacy coin would plummet as people rush to dump them at literally any price being offered.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:36:37
He's supporting the use of BIP91 by miners to force the activation of the current segwit deployment (BIP141). This approach is also compatible with BIP148. If segwit is already locked in on August 1st, BIP148 will take no further action.
We do need BIP148 as a credible threat against miners who would back out of activating segwit otherwise, and as a backup plan in case they still do.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:07:09
BIP149 just turns segwit on at the timeout. Non-segwit blocks would still be valid, so no split would occur at that point.
However, if a segwit-invalid transaction is included in a block, segwit nodes will see it as invalid and reject it. Old nodes will accept it though, since they don't have the code to determine what is invalid under the new rules. At this point, if segwit miners aren't in the majority, the network will split.
Segwit-invalid transactions are currently non-standard, so miners won't include them in blocks by default, but will accept blocks that include them. An attacker looking to split the network would need access to mining power in some way, though not very much of it. 0.1% of the global hashrate would be enough to find a block in about a week.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:39:13

Not at all. Just because you *can* use something for a particular purpose doesn't mean that that was the intended purpose.
The motivating for adopting BIP9 was that there were worries that users would drag their feet on upgrades if soft forks were implemented with a flag date. The idea was that with enough miners enforcing a new rule, non-upgraded users would be protected from attackers attempting to break that new rule.
It turns out that users upgrade relatively quickly, while miners are the ones that drag their feet.

His goal is more revenue, *regardless* of fees. suggested that:

The purpose of the discount isn't to incentivize adoption, it's to remove the incentive to bloat the UTXO set.

My point is just that the order books for BIP148 will initially be empty, with no buy or sell orders, and thus no established price. There won't be any point where you can sell both coins and "double your money" as you initially said.


It's still not symmetric. There is plenty of demand for segwit (which is what makes a segwit UASF viable in the first place), and very little demand for "not segwit".

Renting the necessary hash power is not a very high hurdle, considering the profit to be made from shorting BTC. 0.1% of the global hash rate would find a block in about a week. It's also entirely possible that an existing miner would decide to undertake the attack themselves.


They can mine a private chain if they like, but without an exploitable vulnerability (such as the one potentially introduced by BIP149), they can't make other miners join them. 0.1% of the global hashrate having leverage over the majority is pretty serious.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:32:35
You really need to let go of this false equivalence. It's preventing you from understanding the situation.
For the BIP148 chain to be abandoned as you describe, **all** of its supporters must give up on it. If a BIP148-supporting minority doggedly refuses to back down, their chain will last indefinitely.
For the legacy chain to be destroyed, it only needs to get down to 50% support. If a legacy-supporting minority refuses to back down despite the majority being against them, they will lose everything.
Do you see how this is asymmetric? Do you understand that 0% does not equal 50%?


You are presenting your opinion based on guesswork. In order to refute my points you need to actually understand the code. Feel free to cite code if you can.


That was written by moderate supporters of BIP148 who don't want to cause any trouble. They're saying that we *should* abandon BIP148 if it doesn't have economic majority support, *because* it will cause a chain split. There is no code that will cause this to happen, it's dependent on human decision-making.
What the person who wrote that didn't factor in is that there's [an "intolerant minority" of hard-line BIP148 supporters]( who will not back down no matter what, and will intentionally cause a chain split if necessary.
Since BIP148 is dangerous with few supporters, but gets *safer* as it gains more support, the hard-liners are effectively able to prevent the moderates from backing down. The moderates recognize that giving up would only make things worse, so the only option is to push forward as aggressively as possible. In the same fashion, the BIP148-supporting minority is gradually winning over the neutral majority.

Assuming you mean a "mine empty blocks" hashrate attack, it's not likely. The legacy chain will be wiped out if it doesn't remain longer than the BIP148 chain. Performing such an attack would be dangerous, as it would divert needed hashrate away from the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:26:17
It would certainly be bad to be a user on the legacy chain when it gets wiped. This makes using the legacy chain unattractive in the first place, reducing the likelyhood that there will be a chain split or that it would persist for long.
The disincentive to staying on the legacy chain provides protection against fragmenting the economy. Permanent chain splits have no such protection.

Maxwell is talented, but hopelessly naïve at times. Bitcoin exists for the benefit of its users. Miners are incidental to that. The needs of users must always be prioritized over the needs of miners.
There is a clear safety benefit for users to BIP148-style orphaning over BIP149-style "it's active now" soft forks: both carry the risk of a chain split, but with BIP148 we know exactly when that split will occur. With BIP149 we have no idea. We've already had such a surprise chain split occur due to BIP66, so this is not a merely theoretical concern.
Requiring miners to *correctly do the work that we pay them for* is neither reckless nor coercive, especially when we have direct evidence that they will behave irresponsibly when given the opportunity.

Realistically, the BTC price is almost entirely a result of speculation. Other economic activity has a much smaller direct influence on the price.

I think connection bandwidth is the primary bottleneck. People with bandwidth caps already aren't able to run nodes.
In general, "small blockers" don't necessarily want to keep the block size at 1mb forever, we just want to deal with the issue in an intelligent fashion. It makes the most sense to activate segwit, and then implement the various efficiency improvements that it allows. After that, study the effect of it's de-facto blocksize increase on the ability of people to run nodes, and proceed from there.
A lot of (though not all) big blockers want to force us to bundle a blocksize increase in with segwit (using its activation as a bargaining chip, essentially), or remove the limit entirely with nonsense like Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:06:57
The UASF strategy (even the "intolerant minority" version) doesn't work for undesirable changes. BIP148 is viable because the majority actually want segwit.

Because segwit hasn't been activated yet. There's nothing to study until that happens.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:41:45
There's a feedback loop here:
* As the hash power on the BIP148 side grows, the perceived risk of the legacy chain being wiped increases
* As that risk grows, the price of coins on the legacy chain becomes more and more depressed
* The further the legacy price drops, the more miners will switch over to BIP148 in pursuit of higher revenue
Once we get to 51%, the legacy chain is obviously going to get wiped out eventually. This feedback loop gets rolling much earlier than that, though. I would guess that once the BIP148 chain has 30% of the global hash rate, the conflict is essentially over.


Difficulty level doesn't actually affect the risk of the legacy chain being wiped. Competing chains are compared by "block weight", rather than number of blocks.

We fought against the hard fork proposals because they were *bad changes* to Bitcoin. Segwit is a good change. The method of getting it just isn't pretty. And even as risky as it may be, it's still safer than a hard fork.
If we can get enough user/industry support for BIP148 before August 1st that 51% of miners follow, there won't be any disruption at all. Hell, even if only the current segwit-signaling miners (30%ish) pledged their support for BIP148, the rest would have no choice but to join because of the reorg risk.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:16:28
Once 80% of miners are signalling for BIP91 for a full retarget period, and after another retarget period in the "locked in" state, it will start orphaning and blocks that don't signal for segwit activation.
Unfortunately due to the amount of time it takes (a full month), it won't be compatible with BIP148. 80% signalling would have to be achieved by the end of *June* at the latest, and the schedule doesn't call for this code to be run until *July* 21st.

Technically the BIP148 chain needs 33.3% to be totally immune. The attacker's chain doesn't build on the defenders', so you don't add their hashrate together.
That said, in practice the attacker needs a decent margin to account for variance, the possibility of other miners switching during the attack, and the psychological effect of the legacy chain appearing to lose significant hashrate.

Explanation of BIP148 that I posted earlier today:
In general, a UASF is a boycott of miners that refuse to implement a change that users want. Starting at a specific "flag date", users begin rejecting any blocks produced by those miners, until the miners relent.
This puts economic pressure on miners, because if a significant portion of users reject their blocks, the coins produced by those blocks are worth a lot less (or potentially zero). Miners depend on being able to sell the coins they produce in order to pay their expenses and generate income.
BIP148 is a specific UASF implementation designed to force activation of the current segwit deployment, which is set to time out on November 15th. It requires that all blocks signal in favor of segwit activation, which will cause the required 95% signalling threshold to be met.
The flag date for BIP148 is August 1st. If segwit hasn't been locked in by then, and if a majority of the mining hash power hasn't implemented BIP148 or some compatible proposal, there will be a chain split.
BIP148 nodes will only be see segwit-signalling blocks, so they'll be able to activate segwit on their side of the split. If the BIP148 side of the chain split eventually achieves majority hashing power, the other (legacy) side of the split will be wiped out in a block reorg, and all nodes will start following the BIP148 chain and have segwit active.
A block reorg that discards the legacy chain would also discard any transactions that were made on that chain. Losing all the coins you've received or mined since the split would be a very bad thing. This puts significant economic pressure on the entire Bitcoin economy to adopt BIP148 right away if it looks like there's a chance of it ever gaining majority hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:55:50


That's not quite right. If a bunch of mining power that would have been supporting the legacy chain switches to the hard fork chain, the BIP148 chain will have a larger percentage of the remaining hash power.
In order to wipe out the legacy chain, the BIP148 chain doesn't need to maintain a majority of the global hash rate, just a majority of the hash rate that legacy nodes can see.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:55:25
Accepting your lowball offer doesn't make sense in any way.
If I'm trying to maximize my personal financial resources, I want to sell for the highest price I can get. Even if I think the HF chain has only a 1 in 5000 chance of becoming the dominant chain, and I personally value the HF coins at 50 cents each, I'm still going to sell them for the best price I think I can get. Only after I've exhausted my other options would I consider taking your $1 option.
If I'm trying to make MyChain succeed and make YourChain fail, I still want to sell YourChain coins for the highest price I can get, and buy MyChain coins for the lowest price I can get. Supporters of each chain have finite financial resources, and want to remove as many of their preferred chain's coins from the market as possible. If I sell YourChain coins for $1 each, I'm allowing those coins to be taken off the market, while leaving the buyer with significant remaining resources to buy even more YourChain coins.

This is the only reasonable response to the transparent attempts to gain control of Bitcoin by Bitmain and the Segwit2x group.
If a large amount of mining power leaves Bitcoin and switches to a hard fork chain, non-BIP148 users are in far greater danger of having their transactions wiped out in a block reorg. Core should provide the tools necessary to ensure that no split happens and that segwit activates smoothly for all users.
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:11:47

You and all the other legacy supporters, apparently. You guys are essentially admitting that we're going to win. We have the conviction and coordination to see our plan through. You can't even commit any real resources to oppose us, because you rightly fear that you'd get wiped out.
You may as well just join us. You want what we're offering; just accept that the method isn't pretty. Let's get this conflict wrapped up early so that we can all relax and enjoy the ensuing renewed bull run.


We will get there. We don't even need to be faster, we just need to sufficiently spook the holdouts. Economic actors fearing a reorg will abandon the legacy chain, depressing the price. The depressed price will cause more miners to switch, further increasing the risk of a reorg. Once we start that feedback loop, it's as good as done.

It sounds like you're conflating replay protection with wipeout protection. Replay protection stops transactions intended for one chain from being copied to the other. Wipeout protection stops the less strict chain from being wiped out in a reorg when the more strict chain overtakes it.
Do you expect exchanges to refuse to list legacy BTC because it lacks wipeout protection?
Replay protection can be done manually, by tainting transactions with coins that were mined after the split occurred. This is what Bitfinex plans to do if the BU fork ever occurs, so there's no reason they couldn't apply it to BIP148 vs legacy BTC as well.

30% hash rate on the BIP148 side would induce full panic mode on the legacy side. There's a feedback loop, with reorg risk depressing the legacy price, and legacy miners switching due to the price difference, further increasing the reorg risk.

I will be dumping my legacy coins either way. If it looks like BIP148 really isn't going to succeed, more of my legacy BTC will go towards USD than BIP148 coins. I'll keep my initial stock of BIP148 coins regardless.
My motivation for this is partly because I won't be too keen on Bitcoin's short to mid term prospects if segwit activation fails, and partly because of my full commitment to the BIP148 strategy. If nothing else, we can punish the miners for their recalcitrance by tanking the price, which they depend on for their income.

Getting segwit activated via COOP or segwit2x before August would be great. The more pressure we apply via BIP148, the better the chances of those proposals succeeding.
There's also no reason that BIP148 itself couldn't succeed in practice if the other proposals fall through. Genuinely trying to make it happen makes it a much more credible threat than bluffing does.
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:18:37
It's user activated in the sense that it's a boycott by users against non-compliant miners. It needs miners only in the sense that it needs to apply enough economic pressure for miners to be responsive to it.

Regardless of whose fault it is, BIP148 is happening. [Blame me if you want]( I'm fine with being the bad guy. The only choice you have is to support it and make it safer, or oppose it and make it more dangerous.

The *accelerated* schedule for BIP149 calls for activating it 6 months after deployment, and it can't be deployed until the BIP141 timeout on November 15th. From dev-list discussion, it sounds like January would be the most likely time to start it.
So a year from now. 10 months from August.

A politically-motivated blocksize increase is a terrible idea. Segwit should be implemented first; the effects of its defacto blocksize increase on node count should be studied; and only after that should a *technically sound* blocksize increase be considered.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:51:07


You'd have to coordinate that with all the nodes on the network, not just the miners. With that kind of coordination, everyone may as well just switch over to BIP148 and have the benefits of segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:12:11
In general, a UASF is a boycott of miners that refuse to implement a change that users want. Starting at a specific "flag date", users begin rejecting any blocks produced by those miners, until the miners relent.
This puts economic pressure on miners, because if a significant portion of users reject their blocks, the coins produced by those blocks are worth a lot less (or potentially zero). Miners depend on being able to sell the coins they produce in order to pay their expenses and generate income.
BIP148 is a specific UASF implementation designed to force activation of the current segwit deployment, which is set to time out on November 15th. It requires that all blocks signal in favor of segwit activation, which will cause the required 95% signalling threshold to be met.
The flag date for BIP148 is August 1st. If segwit hasn't been locked in by then, and if a majority of the mining hash power hasn't implemented BIP148 or some compatible proposal, there will be a chain split.
BIP148 nodes will only be see segwit-signalling blocks, so they'll be able to activate segwit on their side of the split. If the BIP148 side of the chain split eventually achieves majority hashing power, the other (legacy) side of the split will be wiped out in a block reorg, and all nodes will start following the BIP148 chain and have segwit active.
A block reorg that discards the legacy chain would also discard any transactions that were made on that chain. Losing all the coins you've received or mined since the split would be a very bad thing. This puts significant economic pressure on the entire Bitcoin economy to adopt BIP148 right away if it looks like there's a chance of it ever gaining majority hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:02:20
If the legacy chain would be wiped out, that means that the BIP148 chain gained majority hash power. In order to do that, BIP148 BTC would also need to be priced higher than legacy BTC.
At that point there'd be no reason to save the legacy chain, especially because the BIP148 chain would have segwit active. Even if you do save it, who is going to mine on it when they could be paid more by mining on the BIP148 chain?
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:10:21
My remarks are based on [the code]( and [the stated timeline](
BIP91 as currently implemented requires a full retarget period at 80% signalling, then another retarget period in the "locked-in" state before it starts rejecting blocks that don't signal for BIP141 activation. That's 28 days, assuming the retarget periods line up perfectly.
On what point exactly do you think I'm mistaken?

BIP148 is a boycott of miners that refuse to activate segwit. Starting August 1st, BIP148 nodes and miners will start rejecting any blocks that don't signal for segwit activation.
If more than 50% (by hash power) of the miners support BIP148, any blocks produced by non-segwit miners will be orphaned. Those miners will be required to switch over in order to continue receiving income. Since all non-orphaned blocks will be signaling for segwit activation, segwit will activate before the November 15th deadline.
If less than 50% of the miners support BIP148, a chain split will occur, with BIP148 nodes and miners on one side, and non-BIP148 (legacy) nodes and miners on the other. If the BIP148 side gains majority hash rate later, any transactions made on the legacy chain since the split will be discarded, and the Bitcoin network will be back to a single chain.

A significant chunk (majority?) of Ripple's (the largest after Bitcoin, at $423,901,917) supply is held by the developers, and I'm not sure if coinmarketcap accounts for that. If they don't, then Bitcoin's actual share is even larger. The same applies to any coin marked "significantly pre-mined".

[About 10% at the moment.]( Someone keeps turning thousands of nodes on and off, so the graph has some weird spikes.
Absolute node count isn't what matters, though. The importance of any particular node depends on how much economic activity happens through that node. My node matters, your node matters, thousands of otherwise unused AWS nodes don't matter. The node of a medium-sized business perhaps matters more than yours or mine. Bitstamp's node matters a lot. Etc.
To further complicate things, nodes alone won't determine the outcome. If a chain split happens, it's highly likely that whichever side has the higher coin price is the one that will succeed. Bitcoin's price is determined much more by speculation than by non-speculative economic activity. Even with very little support from economic nodes, BIP148 or another UASF could succeed by support from speculators alone.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:34:02
Hard to say. Ideally it will end up being resolved *before* August 1st, with more than 50% of miners committed beforehand. Pressure from BIP148 may also cause them to activate segwit earlier by other means.
Futures markets could help with this, by allowing traders to "pre-order" BIP148 and legacy coins, similar to how Bitfinex's BCC/BCU tokens work. Prices on the futures market would give miners an indication of which chain is going to be most profitable for them to mine.
Even just getting the current segwit-signalling miners to support BIP148 would be enough to determine the outcome. 30% of the hashrate on the BIP148 chain would present an immense threat of wiping out the legacy chain. This would cause a feedback loop, with traders selling legacy coins for BIP148 coins due to the risk, further shifting prices, and causing more miners to switch over in pursuit of profits.
Hopefully another 20% of miners would be able to see the inevitable outcome of this scenario, and join the BIP148 side early in order to prevent the split from happening at all.

It's very important to be pragmatic here. Making some sort of quixotic stand on pride or "principle" doesn't help anyone.




You may be willing to wait, but there are too many people that are sick of waiting and are suspicious of any further attempts to delay. It's unrealistic to expect those people to pass up the opportunity that BIP148 presents. The attempt is guaranteed to happen, so we need to react to that in some way. I believe the best response is to push forward and make it successful.

Unless you're willing to commit to a side by selling coins on one chain and/or buying them on the other, or putting your resources on the line in some other way, your influence is negligible. Almost all of the other legacy supporters are similarly unwilling to commit.
The BIP148 side is both risk-tolerant and committed. We'll be the ones determining the prices of coins on each chain, and the majority of miners are going to mine whichever one gives them the greater income.
But hey, if whining is all you've got, keep at it, I guess.

Segwit2x does not use BIP148, currently. [Jeff Garzik has refused to implement anything to make it compatible]( If the existing segwit deployment (BIP141) were to be locked in by August 1st, BIP148 would be rendered inert and there would be no chain split.

If BIP148 has 33.3% hash power and you attack with 33.4%, you're only leaving 33.3% on the legacy chain. You need to leave more on the legacy chain than you're attacking with, otherwise the legacy chain gets wiped.


If legacy gets wiped, the conflict is over. No one is going to bother to stay on it at that point.


It won't be immediately obvious that that's what's happening, since it'll be obscured by variance. People will just see the legacy chain losing hash rate relative to the BIP148 chain, and start panic selling (harder than they were, anyway). That may lead non-attacking legacy miners to start jumping over.
Overall these attacks are just too costly and too risky to bother with. It's worth noting that ETC was never 51% attacked by ETH supporters.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:53:12
Hashrate attacks are unlikely. They're too expensive and present too much of a danger to the legacy chain by diverting hash power away from it.


33.3% is totally immune, since the attacker would no longer be able to keep more hash power on the legacy chain than they're attacking with. Even at lower levels, the attacker has to factor in variance and the risk of a chuck of hash power defecting from the legacy side during the attack. Even the *perception* that the legacy chain is in danger could be fatal.

In the case of BIP148, trying to get the miners to activate segwit (bugfixes and scaling improvements) before the deployment times out on November 15th.


Continued refusal by the miners to activate segwit, stalling tactics, and other shenanigans. The segwit deployment needs readiness signalling from 95% of the mining power in order to activate. Miners have been using this safety mechanism as a veto because they don't like the changes.


Yes. UASFs are dangerous if they only have a small amount of support, but get safer as support for them grows. If BIP148 is well-supported enough by the economy that a majority of the mining hashrate chooses to run it before August 1st, there will be no chain split at all.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:16:58
Yes, they do have to fear that. It's not pretty, and it's not nice, but the reorg risk is what makes the UASF strategy work.
Call it an attack if you want. I can see how it looks like that from the perspective of those who want to stop segwit or use it as a political bargaining chip. They can deal with it. I'm not interested in letting them block progress anymore.

At ~30% the BIP148 chain is still dependent on additional miners switching over to it, so it's not absolutely *guaranteed*. It is highly likely though, because of the wipeout risk exerting downward pressure on the price of legacy coins.

That would mean another year or more of waiting. With BIP148 available now, it's inevitable that people are going to try to activate it. We're past the point where it can be safely ignored, so the best option is to support it in order to reduce the risk and severity of a chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:02:00


Since BU is a hard fork with no wipeout protection, it has an asymmetric risk profile working against it. If they fork at 75% and the price of BTU doesn't stay strictly above BTC (it won't), miners will jump back to Core and the BU chain will be destroyed in a reorg.
In the case of BIP148, we have the same asymmetric risk profile, but it works *for* us, and against the legacy chain. If the legacy chain gets down to 75% hash power, it's in danger. If it gets down to 70%, it's as good as dead. It'll collapse the rest of the way in a feedback loop of defections by panicked holders and profit-seeking miners.


When we started, we had BitFury's support (which is what won me over in the first place). They've since gotten a bit wishy-washy, but that's not a good reason to abandon the project. We've still been steadily gaining support, and we'll gain a lot more (both users and miners) if the Barrycon agreement falls through. If it doesn't fall through, and they stick with BIP91 as they currently appear to be doing, then segwit will be active, and BIP148 will be unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:11:13
Sure, if the BIP148 hashrate is very small and not growing, everyone else will be able to safely ignore it. They can't ignore it if it's substantial (even if mostly static) or growing (even if small).

It sounds like you never understood the strategy in the first place, then. By backing out you're making the situation worse for everyone. With less support there's a higher chance of a chain split, and a longer time to resolve the split if it occurs.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:35:34
Ideally they would incorporate BIP148 into it too, that way they start orphaning non-segwit blocks when they get to 80% BIP91 signalling *or* on August 1st, whichever comes first. Would prevent any weird double-split from happening.

Hashrate follows price. Jihan may be committed to his position, but the rest of the miners aren't.


We definitely have economic power. Many of us are early adopters, and we're willing to actually use our coins.




If none of the legacy supporters are going to take the position opposite ours, there's really nothing to stop us. You don't get to stay neutral and still have influence.


So we set prices, miners follow prices, and the great neutral majority follows those miners. Glad you're comprehending this.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011, and have a solid understanding of how it works. I have a degree in CS (not that I think that's impressive; it just shows that I am technically-minded). I am extremely heavily invested; 95% of my net worth is in BTC. Not only that, I am willing to risk my coins in support of BIP148. I will be dumping all of my legacy coins once I have the opportunity to do so.
There are many others like me who support BIP148 to a similar degree. Yes, we have idealistic newbies as well, but trying to paint us all that way is either extremely misinformed or extremely dishonest.

@_date: 2017-06-07 00:33:13
The only way to avoid the split is either for BIP148 to have enough support that it starts with majority hash power on August 1st, or for it to have no support whatsoever. If nothing else, supporters will contract with miners to buy blocks outright. You can't stop it by opposing it, which is why the conservatives have been freaking out trying to convince us to give up.

We're past the point of no return, though. It's safer to join than to oppose. More support makes a chain split less likely, and resolves any split that does occur more quickly.
As an added bonus, BIP148 pressures the Barrycon folks into actually activating segwit using BIP91. Jeff Garzik appears to have agreed to it, we just need to keep the pressure up to stop Jihan from backing out of the deal.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:21:00

I'm fairly optimistic about it. It could succeed just on the basis of speculators buying BIP148 coins (or futures) and dumping legacy coins. I don't think many will be doing the opposite, due to the potential of the legacy coins being wiped out. The folks on the BIP148 side are also the more risk-tolerant ones.
That said, if more of the ecosystem is supporting BIP148, more speculators will be willing to take a chance on it, so it's always helpful to have feedback like this.

That doesn't work. Nodes accept the first valid block that they receive. Messing with the timestamp won't cause the original block to be replaced; the attacker has to get an additional block ahead in order to orphan the other chain.

That's kind of the point. Bitcoin mining ASICs will be pretty much exclusively owned by *Bitcoin miners*. Even government FPGA cracking clusters won't be sufficient. An attacker would have to specifically buy Bitcoin ASICs, and buy more of them than all of the legit Bitcoin miners combined.


Which is entirely feasible. You'd be able to rip off more money from the Litecoin exchanges than it would cost you to rent the botnet. And don't forget that unlike an attack on Bitcoin, you're not getting your payout in the currency that you're attacking.
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:15:35


The difference is that Bitcoin's hashrate will eventually be out of reach of any realistic attacker, while Litecoin will remain vulnerable. Everyone has Litecoin mining hardware available to them, whereas Bitcoin mining hardware must be manufactured/bought for that specific purpose.


Bitcoin is at 50 TH/s right now. You'd need more than 30 of those rigs to pull off a 51% attack. By the time BFL actually ships those, the hashrate will be even higher.

Nope. The wipeout risk exists because legacy nodes consider the BIP148 side of the chain split to be valid. If it ever becomes longer than the legacy side, the legacy nodes will discard all legacy blocks since the split and start following the BIP148 chain.
BIP148 nodes will never accept the legacy side of the chain split as valid, regardless of how long it is. They will always follow the BIP148 side.

It will happen. There's plenty of demand for it among supporters and detractors alike. Some exchange will take the opportunity to earn those fees.

Unfortunately, unless this is modified, or run by 80% of the hashrate extremely soon, it won't activate before August 1st.
The current code requires a full difficulty adjustment period to determine if it has 80% miner signaling on bit4, then another full adjustment period in the BIP9 "locked in" state. Only after that does it start enforcing segwit signaling.
This means that 80% signaling is necessary by the end of *June*. Their current timeline is to start running it *July 21st*.

Mostly from existing miners, as they gradually recognize that supporting BIP148 is in their interests. I'd expect those that are currently signaling for segwit to switch over first. If we get all of the segwit miners, that'll be enough to guarantee success.

Nope. Most coins aren't on the market.

Why would you have dollars? If Bitcoin's deflation prevents you from spending it, shouldn't it also prevent you from doing anything with your dollars/euros/possessions other than buying more bitcoins?

If it's four times easier for a miner to find a block, it's also four times easier for an attacker to find one. Don't think of transaction security in terms of how many blocks have to be found to reverse the transaction, instead think of it in terms of computation time needed.

My bad, I thought your comment was coming from the anarchist side. Carry on.

I haven't switched to Bitfloor yet because I'm not willing to pay a 4% fee to LocalTill when Dwolla only charges 25 cents. However, I just did some research and it looks like a Capital One 360 checking account can neatly fill Dwolla's role. They don't have any branches near me, but apparently you can link an existing checking account to your Capital One account, just like with Dwolla or PayPal.
As a bonus, they claim that their ACH transfers take 2 days, as opposed to Dwolla's 3-5 days.

Then swapping your plan B and plan A around should be pretty trivial, right? If not, you probably need to work on your plan B some more.

Source? This doesn't sound accurate.
In order to undo one 10-minute block with twice as much computational power as the rest of the network, it takes 10 minutes. In order to undo four 2.5-minute blocks with the same proportion of compute power, it still takes 10 minutes.
EDIT: I guess this actually has an effect if the attacker has less computational power than the rest of the network and is relying on luck to undo a block. More blocks means less variance in hashes per block, regardless of difficulty. Still curious about the source, though.

Bitfinex does need more bears. Most of my BTC are sitting unborrowed.  :/

Since the OP identifies as a leftist and thinks anarchy is baaaaaaad. Obviously anarchists must be just like Republicans and fascists!  /s

This is why it bothers me when people call the guy an idiot for buying the pizza. Clearly we should have all been going hungry and buying bitcoins, because food was so expensive back then.

The profitability of mining alt chains will always oscillate slightly above and below the profitability of mining bitcoins. As ASIC miners drive down the profitability of Bitcoin GPU mining, the profitability of mining alt chains will be driven down to match it.

It's not a good use of resources, though. All of the alt-chain enthusiasts seem to be thinking about the situation backwards.
Bitcoin wasn't created so that people could make money from their CPUs and GPUs, it was created so that people would have a secure, inexpensive, decentralized, anonymous, and non-inflationary means of exchange that could be used through the internet. These are the properties that give it value. Being able to make money for computing hashes is merely a side effect of the system's design, not a design goal.
None of the current alt-chains provide any value over what Bitcoin already provides. There's no reason to use them instead of Bitcoin. Litecoin is particularly laughable, because designing it to be mineable only by CPUs and GPUs means that it will remain vulnerable to 51% attacks by sufficiently large botnets. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will be completely immune to such attacks by any general purpose hardware.
This all seems to be lost on the alt-chain crowd, though. They're just going through the motions and hoping to magically replicate Bitcoin's level of success.

Maybe you should tell these guys that:
* Businessweek: ["Bitcoin: The Anarchist Virtual Currency"](
* Businessweek: ["Bitcoin, the Internet’s favorite, media-friendly, anarchist crypto-currency"](
* Business Insider: ["BITCOIN 101: A Beginner's Guide To The Unfakeable Digital Anarchist Currency Everyone's Obsessed With"](
* IEEE Spectrum: ["Bitcoin: The Cryptoanarchists’ Answer to Cash"](
Like it or not, the mainstream public sees Bitcoin as "the anarchist currency". It's not necessarily an unfair characterization either, considering how many anarchists and anarchist sympathizers have been involved and invested (financially and otherwise) in the project since the beginning.

Mutualist types are probably going to be the most receptive to it, if they aren't already sold.
The ones that want to abolish all money (primitivists, some anarcho-communists and syndicalists) are pretty much guaranteed not to be interested, though.

BTC in your MtGox account are in MtGox's wallet. They only get transferred to your bitcoin address when you make a withdrawal.
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:33:07
Each address has its own private key. Bitcoin QT's private keys are stored in wallet.dat, and they're encrypted if you specified a password (which you should). You only need to deal with private keys directly if you're migrating an address from one wallet to another.

If you're using Dwolla, you can set up recurring payments. I've got one set up to send money to MtGox twice a month, and then I have a standing buy order on my MtGox account. No intervention on my part is required, except for occasionally logging into MtGox to collect the accumulated coins.

Bitcoin is a hell of a lot more efficient and secure than sending cash through the mail.
