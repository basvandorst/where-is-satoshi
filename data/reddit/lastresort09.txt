I don't think he went around giving money because he cared but just to show off how rich he was. He is just an egotistical man who tries to gain power over others and doesn't seem to have an ounce of humbleness. I guess people like Bill Gates are seriously rare i.e. people who don't let money power go to their head. 
Maybe it is a great thing to not have people like that around.

I didn't really know much about how his recent things so thanks for waking me up to that. However, like I said, I am also going to try to read up on it and see what I can find concerning the topic but at least I know there is a problem. 
I mainly liked him because of trying to place importance on ideas through things like TED and also for helping with the making of the needless vaccines, which are also greatly useful. I will definitely take a look into the things you have stated and hopefully learn some new things and gain a different perspective.

I will read it but frankly the guy seems rather biased to begin against Bill Gates. 
I know about Bill Gates history and I know he wasn't really a good guy... but currently he is trying to do a lot to improve conditions. This guy is even making it sound like Bill Gates contribution to the world of computers is also bad. So I am not going to jump on either side but I will be skeptical.

I have heard of so many people getting rich from bitcoins but never had the opportunity of actually talking to one. 
How rich did you get if you don't mind me asking? How long ago did you start getting into bitcoins?

Don't worry man. Redditors actually gave reddit gold to Bill Gates... so yeah I am guessing that's just a way they express themselves now.

Did this just seriously happen? Damn.

Well a simple "No" was enough and he could even mentioned how he didn't like people pestering him about it, and that would have been the end of it. Instead, he went about to say how he will no longer do this anymore and everyone needs to blame the first guy who asked. That's just creating drama and made me lost respect for him. The guy who asked wasn't even rude about it and even did it in a joking manner. So the escalation, personally, was uncalled for and basically overreacting. He acted like a pompous king. I still decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, but then he decided to joke about wanting to deduct bitcoins from a guy for suppporting SabiWabi... again went well with the general "King" attitude that was displaying. Just look at his name too... that itself is rather flashy. 
That's not being generous but just a douche. 
P.S. I didn't downvote you in case it wasn't clear.

Yes his ego is the reason he wants to do this, but that doesn't mean he wants to do it through his main account and forever get messages from people begging him for money. 
I said he had an ego... I didn't say he was stupid.

Alright man... You are awesome.
