Great work. At the tender age of 16, you've created something truly productive and of a good quality. Not to mention you've got an interest in crypto at a really young age so are well on your way to future successes.

There are over 1000 cryptocurrencies on the market. Granted, a huge number are a pile of shite but, the fact that you think BTC is the entire market, makes me want to not talk to you anymore.

People are buying BAT because they want a better browser that allows them to reward content-creators rather than them rely on intrusive ads.
People are buying FUEL because they want to be able to create their own smart contracts with minimal effort.
People are buying XMR because they want to be able to transact completely anonymously.
People are buying REQ because they want to send and receive money and bypass PayPal and the banking cartels.
Etc, etc, etc.

Was there any point to this entirely made up nonsense?

1. You create a 1 stop destination that counters all fake news and corrects the misinformation. Had an idea for a blog for a while. It would basically take every single Daily Mail article, research the story and create a "this is what actually happened" article. The point is, the DM is full of shite and fake news so I would restore balance in the universe.
2. That's what this is. It's price manipulation to buy when they're cheap. But also to ruin the credibility of competing currencies.
Stay strong.

Are you all fucking stupid? I'm saying there's an opportunity, not a guarantee.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:34:05
Your ignorance is outstanding. If you really believe that's all crypto is for then you're out of your mind. And your point is even worse. Crypto is not purely speculation, some - certainly not all - are tackling real world problems.

Yes, it is. Withdraw, run and celebrate. There are always those who make bank in a ponzi for a while but it won't last and you don't know when the music will stop.

I'm confused, has BTC always been treated as taxable by the US Govt? If it's a new law then surely OP is safe unless it applies retrospectively.
Forgive my ignorance, AFAIK, it's still not taxable in the UK - happy to be corrected.

Sorry, I didn't realise I was speaking to the world's spokesperson. Thanks for setting me straight. I'll sell all my holdings now.

Although I don't believe in being litigious for every single scenario, doesn't some of the blame lie with Dropbox here? If things happened the way you say - and you are in the field - why don't you seek legal advice and see if there's any negligence on their part that enabled people to steal your BTC? After all, I'm sure they make bold claims about how strong their security is.
As an aside, I actually think putting things on the cloud isn't the worst idea in the world. Sure, I'd have a physical back up or 2 but, imagine your house burns down or you lose access to the physical ones, a cloud back up is a good way of regaining access. I guess the key is to not make it obvious what the file is.
Nevertheless, good luck for the future.

But that's not at all true. People have already made money, the tech has already helped people/businesses, there have already been tangible rewards. How can you say there may not be an opportunity?

It is hard. And that's coming from someone who doesn't panic and is quiet comfortable losing his entire investment. It is definitely hard.
I don't struggle with the drop in value against USD, I struggle with the regret of not using my BTC to buy something else before this correction occurred. A good opportunity to get coins relatively cheaply squandered.

Productivity is relative. If someone finds it useful, it's useful.

You're right. That triggered a memory in my brain. It's a difference in classification. The IRS consider it an investment while the UK see it more as gambling.

Your presence is appreciated. It's an interest in a new, emerging technology that will create plenty of opportunities in the future. Just because you've missed the boat, or are too thick to see an opportunity, doesn't mean there isn't one there.
