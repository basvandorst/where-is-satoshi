It's not a "possibility in some people's view": it is *already possible* to have 2 MB blocks right now.
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:34:18
Alphabet 400B? You sure?
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:44:41
What do you want exact: 32MB blocks or transaction fee of a cent?
By the way, you know that with "real huuge mass adoption" a 32 MB will not be enough to have transaction fee of a cent, don't you?
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:24:53
That will only affect half the globe, won't it?
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:10:13
Indeed, half the world without electronic devices. But it won't be the end of bitcoin.

To which question?
Yes, I know that Visa system is centralised, yes.
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:31:10
Do you know then that Visa system is centralised, don't you?
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:02:45
Exactly the same way you'll spend your USD ;)
By the way, the BTCUSD will be infinite then (undefined really, 0/0), as Bitcoin and USD will be worth 0... ;)
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:48:08


You are forgetting the condition: "and keeping Bitcoin decentralised".
Or maybe you don't care about centralisation.
You were speaking about 2MB blocks (as it they were something not possible now). You changed to 32 MB to achieve "huuge mass adoption". And now you are talking about 680 MB blocks?
As I said previously, you are not talking about increasing the blocksize, you are talking about deleting it.
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:16:23
You are not asking about a blocksize increase, you are asking about no size limit...
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:23
You can see it in this other way: Bitcoin in its current state is so much useful for some people that they are willing to pay the actual fees... Maybe it's unusable for you and for many other people, but there are people paying these fees right now because it's worth it...
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:14:46


How big do you think the blocksize must be in order to achieve that with "huuuge mass adoption"?
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:39:04
Maybe in US (Venmo) and in China (WeChat Pay) market saturation is near, but the work is larger than that, and I still see an open opportunity there. User Experience is the key. I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:38:35
Does Petro need a website in order to make a transaction? What kind of "currency" is it?
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:03:51
"media" just want a story to tell... or to say it properly: "a story to sell"... No need to check if it's true...
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:06:20
Let's discuss it theoretically then.
How much will the Blockchain increase daily with a 700 MB (let's round it) block full?
700 * 6 * 24 = 100800 MB -&gt; 100 GB / day (rounded)
Yearly: 100 * 365 -&gt; 36 TB / year.
Do you think a 36 TB / year increasing Blockchain will not produce a centralised system?
And we could also theoretically talk about bandwidth needed, CPU needed in nodes, CPU + bandwidth needed mining nodes in order to not produce orphan nodes... But I don't think it's needed. Just seeing the amount of storage needed is enough...
And that's trying to support today's Visa's payments.
But we don't need a system "as Visa's"... We need a system much better and powerful that could support *payment streams* (sat/second), a system that could support machine2machine payments, etc.
Try to look to what could be possible and needed in the future, not just to what it is happening today.
Edit: format
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:17:05
You know what we are better prepared to do than robots? To consume.
We are moving to being mostly consumers...
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:30:10
People want to believe anything... Much easier than reasoning...
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:50:19
Define "well informed"... ;)

Don't worry, the debt is in dollars... ;)
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:49:34
You'll find out about the important news, don't worry. Someone will tell you (friends, co-workers, etc).
There's no need to waste time and energy watching TV news.
Try it for a while...
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:02:55
That's something I have been thinking too: are the governments pushing FB into Bitcoin with all these Libra backlash?
If they are, I m sure they are not realising it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:45:13
It's not enough evidence, as other possibilities exist: he could have stolen the keys, or bought them, or crack them (in the future)...
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:31:38
The fiat finances are also electronic depending, but much more vulnerable as they are centralised.
So bitcoin is much more resistant to some electronic disaster.

Android here, not iOS.
Ok, I see the app permissions on my Google account, thanks! I've removed them, and I have checked that the Breez app is requesting again the permissions in order to being able to make the backup. Nice!
However, I still think more information about the backup status is needed somewhere on the app UI.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:05:08
I checked the app permissions and it didn't have the storage one. I checked on Google Drive Apps Backup folder, and I didn't find Breez subfolder. And I had no warning at all... Very confusing.
Yes, I think more information is needed.
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:34:33
Same problem here. How can I check if there is a backup?  How will I be able to restore it if my phone crashes?
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:31:16
True, but you can use the "remove funds" option to pay to a BTC on-chain address.
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:48:49
Thanks for the info.
But I don't know if when I installed it I opted for backup or not. Where can I check it? Where can I change that setting? Where can I check last time the backup was done?
Thanks again!
@_date: 2019-06-03 18:35:56

If he could, it wouldn't mean he was Satoshi though.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:34:35
I have not got an easy answer. I just know that Satoshi did everything possible in order to remain anonymous. And he disappeared.
So I doubt that he will ever tried to prove his identity.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:39:42
Why do you use "capitalism" when you just want to say "competition"?
@_date: 2018-11-04 12:57:58
Digital money exists since ~ the 70s when banks got their first computers...
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:21:48
Most of those technologies doesn't need a hard fork. They can be implemented with soft fork: segwit, schnorr... or don't need even a soft fork: lightning, sidechains/drivechains...
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:45:08
I reckon the most popular decision is to deploy it combined with taproot and schnorr signatures in the next soft fork. No ETA yet afaik...
Edit: s/noor/norr/

But couldn't sidechains have different PoW, even completely different (PoS)? As far as I understand, they would only share with bitcoin the asset. So, mining of a different sidechain could be independent. (I am not an expert, just trying to clarify myself. And maybe I'm completely misunderstanding the concept here).
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:26:05
Ah, ok! I get it now! :)

So, when somebody wants to transfer just BTC from ViaBTC to their personal wallets (because they've sold their BCC, for example), how will it work?
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:54:34
You do not have to trust a chinese exchange in order to sell BCH. You can also do it in Kraken, for example...
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:32:22
Because if you don't control the keys, you don't really control and own your bitcoins.
You depend on what the exchange decides: follow a hard fork? Offering bitcoins on more than one fork?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:27:51
Well, before doing that, you should move your bitcoins (just BTC, not BCC) to another address/wallet after the hardfork happened. As it's after the hardfork, your BTC will be on the new address/wallet, and your BCC will still be on the old address/wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:22:33
Any ETA for bitcoin sidechains? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:59:56
Becasuse segsignal it is just about activating segwit and it does not include the later hardfork?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:36:40
Mmm... I'm not sure about replaying transaction on both chains... I thought you will only be able to make transactions on BCC chain using one of their wallets... But I may be wrong... 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:06:57
It will depends which wallet you use and which fork will it let you work with.
If a hard fork happens, you will have the same amount of bitcoins in both chains (if you have them before the fork, obviously). And you will be able to import your keys in wallets that support both chains and work with your bitcoins in the two chains.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:40:10
I know Core weren't opposed to larger blocks, but I understand they want to test how the network works with segwit activated so that it safer as possible to make the next upgrade.
I reckon next January is in too short time to make that kind of hard fork. But that's just me.
Curious to see how all this evolve in the next months.
Edit: ok, I understand now what your comment was about, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:48:19
Would we? In January 2018? Who''s supporting that large block implementation release in January?
Edit: I'm asking a genuine question, not trolling. Just wanted to know if some developers are considering this path...
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:22:51
But how do you know that's a male and not a female?
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:32:22
Touché.... :D
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:31:37
I agree with you that we shouldn't give a shit about it, but I disagree that it's easiest to just assume it's a male... ;)
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:27:10

What about the water supply?
I've read you are using a well. Does it scale? Obviously it's not as the solar energy, as it is finite.
Have you considered it as a mid term risk? Or at least as a possible increasing cost in the long term...
I thought there is now a drought around California... I don't know if it apply to your place, but wouldn't it be possible in the future to appear some kind of regulation affecting consumption (and its price) from your water supply?
Just curious.
(Sorry if it has already been asked this question in this long thread...)
