Blockchain game In the short term, blockchain games are speculative users. In the long run, speculative users are only a small group.
Who is the target user of the game? Everyone who has time is the target user of the game! They spend money on the game with the psychology of consumption.
Who is the target user of the betting? Most of the gambling users are speculative users. Their participation in gambling is "investment psychology." They want to "earn" more money through gambling, and the purpose is very clear.
