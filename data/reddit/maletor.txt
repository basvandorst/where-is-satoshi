Categorically not. Must be 3 which only makes it a maybe. Any bech32 address is segwit though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:08:41
This is why we need unique addresses for send. I'm happy he got the money but it's better for privacy that we don't know he did. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:46:59
It's there for semver. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:36:45
We are getting pretty desperate for some news, I suppose. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 00:42:26
Definitely not. There are stop orders and limit orders (and even stop-limit). Stop orders carry no guarantees. It is an order to sell at market value once prices start trading at your stop level. Limits are required to be filled at your limit price or better. You can even combine these to little benefit.

They are blaming hodlers.


dangerous asset class to force into an exchange traded structure, including shallow trade volume,
extreme hoarding

What makes you think gold has no liquidity.

It does mean shit, though. I grant you that Bitcoin's market cap is lower due to "burned" or unrecoverable coins. Perhaps even as much as 50% lower but probably not quite so much. If you say Bitcoin's market cap is closer to $40B you will find tons of companies you have never heard of.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:30:01
What are you talking about? So GS and MS and hedge funds and independently wealthy people do not own BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:17:39
I can't help you at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:31:40
News. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:08:46
Wait, I thought Segwit allowed 4MB with a practical 2MB usable. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:35:13
But not really. It's FUD. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:54:47
Wow. Correct. 
I would argue the shit out of your last sentence to a judge if I had a lot riding on it. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:59:46
Not really. Some of those companies are recognizable and some aren't. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:40:04
Why do people keep saying this?
Bitcoin's market cap is $70B. That is bigger than Netflix or Adobe. While it's true that it's 1% of gold's market cap, it's far from dial up modems--it's getting to be mainstream.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:48:26
You can. But the loss has to be 2% of something something, I think. Tax law sucks.

Big investors trade futures where there is more leverage not ETFs. An ETF will allow for arbitrage though and increase liquidity and decrease spreads.

P2P is sufficient for now.

lol. fuck that. i'm not trust ifttt.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:33:20
Why would you do that? Each customer gets a unique account.

Ya but if you're in the same car crash...

This is why bitcoin etf is so important. It can be done without it but it makes it more complicated. Everything you said is 100% true and I hope this post gets more upvotes.

Still need _somewhere_ to store the private keys that does not include under my mattress.

This isn't the first time I've heard this. And i have to say it sounds like a conspiracy theory to me. Even if you have to buy oil in dollars it's not like the seller could prevent you from hedging with the real currency you wanted to buy. 
For example, I own international bonds but I buy them in dollars via hedging even though they are denominated in local currency.
