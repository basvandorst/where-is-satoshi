A lawsuit against the second largest isp in the US citing the [official Attorney General press release]( with stats such as




is not evidence enough that an isp can falsely advertise internet speeds to a large scale of their customers?
I'm confused about how you don't think it proves that Mundus2018's claim that 90% of isp customers is a bad assumption.

Ah, well i see your point there. I was making the case that generally speaking, ISPs can fall short. 
I have 0 knowledge of the isp landscape in brazil, or any sources about the reliability of advertised speeds there. So my bad. 
And i agree, this entire thread is off in its assumptions.
