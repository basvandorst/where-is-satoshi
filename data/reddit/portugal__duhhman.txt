Why are they soo good lol 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:24:00
Damn. Big drop just now
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:27:40
But have you sent money from coinbase TO BoA??
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:38:21
I invest in... BOTH ;) MOTIFF FOR THE WIN :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:39:31
Student loans and maybe even car paid off. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:08:24
I read that and others like it. It seems that some people say their banks work and others say it doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:03:54
Supports but not ready for buys 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:04:45
Hey BITCOIN. COME ON MAN! LETS PUSH THIS ISHHHHH PAST 20K!! LETS GET A MOVE ON! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:35:14
If only they BOTH would go up at the same time ����
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:48:58
Over 321K and counting. Dope
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:32:33
Pay off student loans :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:21:08
Really?! That's great. Was worried boA blocked withdrawals and deposits. How do you enable instant buy?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:23:33
And I'm assuming withdrawals to either checking or savings would work the same? Appreciate the replies btw!
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:39:23
If people could just stop selling. Then we can ALL benefit with higher prices but nooooo
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:55:48
I'm a noob too but I feel you 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:59:49
Fees? 3%? Or is it something else 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:34:15
Hit 15 then back down to 14.8. Sigh 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:21:15
Y'all think good or bad 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:39:00
Hell ya
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:44
But youll use who to buy before transferring to nano?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:26:20
You too!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:29:43
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:17:51
It's just that everyone makes it seem that it can be easy to mess and it be lost forever 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:12:06
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:35
You again:)
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:10:54
I sure hope that's not the case 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:29
But you reallllyyyy think we will get to that point?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:52
Haha right? Paying my car and student loans off is pretty cool to me! Money I save on payments will be Bitcoin money ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:58
What do you mean? Sorry if I sound stupid. I've been trying to learn as much as possible. Like I'm coinbase if I also want to buy BCash AND Bitcoin I'll lose my Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:05:11
Where! Send link
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:29:26
Same here. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:19
Yea no shit 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:42
I bought in at 10K and I'm as excited as anyone here. Shoot, I even have a shirt coming in the mail that y'all will probably like ;) but if this thing ever does crash. I mean collapse to the days of 10-100 a coin, I don't see how it ever returns to the present. 
Here's to hodling 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:26
Haha I saw it and think the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:43
Honestly. At this moment it's to get close to paying off student loans of 15K. If I could get to car payment as well great. If I could ever pay them off sooner rather than later then I would reinvest all that extra cash into bitcoin again.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:31:04
Nothing wrong with gaming and checking Bitcoin price during a few pauses here or there ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:02:19
Hah! I did the same exact thing 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:03
Good thing next year is so soon
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:11
For ME personally.. I'm out if I can make 20K. If I can pay my car I'm out. I'll pay the car off, use money I save on payments to buy back in! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:47
Right. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:25
Yea check it out on their site and tell me what you think
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:59:50
Man.. I got in when it hit 10K. then I kept waiting for that "dip" to fall more than it did. Didn't buy more and now it's at an ATH lol. Best time to buy is always NOW. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:29
My girl said the same thing lol. Soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:20:16
To clarify: I mean steady climbing and dropping INSTEAD OF the volatility we have been seeing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:17
✋��back at ya!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:53
Which is when? How will it change the way things are now? For fact fees will go down?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:16
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:16
I am really considering some B Cash, but i hate the whole this side vs that. I'm not going to get rid of BTC for all Cash. Just don't want to I guess miss out on some potential money just to stay faithful one way or another. 
I guess I'll wait for coinbase to start buying and selling, then make my decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:40:54
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:43:14
I'm considering coinbase vault for fear of transactions from coinbase to a hard wallet somehow going wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:47
Sigh. I really love this community man. I jumped in around 10K and at this point I'll hodl it out. Down or up. You win some and you lose some. Fingers crossed tho
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:26:07
Credit card purchases are the fastest. That's all I use 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:31
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:30:00
Ditto. Wish they weren't $180 on Amazon SMH
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:41:21
Lol ok
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:09
It’ll definitely add to the likelihood of early age heart disease 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:28
Ponzi scheme. Shut up lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:02
I'm KINNNND of in the same boat except with potential work bonus. I just got 2k in bonus, but I have 2 credit cards I can pay off within maybe a month or so with some saving and using the bonus towards them. I MIGHT also get another bonus but not sure how much and I expect it to be less than 2K. I have 14k in student loans. Also wanting to buy a house. Blah. 
I've already bought in at $200 and added some but thinking about adding more 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:07
But if you DONT sell your Bitcoin and just ALSO buy BCash..
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:35:51
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:14
How do you link PayPal? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:38
I believe so too. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:51
So do you believe it won't ever go up to the 20K or higher that others once spoke of?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:05:17
Same. Sold ethereum to buy more bitcoin. Wasn't feeling the whole cryptokitty thing going on over there lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:28
I'm not sure what to think.. obviously banks don't like Bitcoin, so is it overall good or bad for BITCOIN price?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:36:18
Haha same here! I just want Portugal to focus on the world cup for now ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:14:40
Ideally would be 5K or so.. I'm in it for the long run so if it wants to go down before ever hitting 20K and above I'm all for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:00
Haven't heard of that other trezor. Where do you buy from? Amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:37:47
Then you can buy bcash low and hodl while hodling your BTC lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:28
That's strange since I've never had that issue ever and if I check my account I see the charge pending 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:13
Yes thst is true...BUT people probably shouldn't have invested for a quick score 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:01:58
That's the spot with probably most growth potential.. drop a grand. Get a few coins and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:23
I want to reach "my moon" and then come back to Bitcoin. Others may not want to which I feel would be a problem. If I didn't have debt then my mindset would be different and I would act differently regarding hodling or cashing out 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:38:55
Thinking the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:20:09
To clarify: I mean steady climbing and dropping INSTEAD OF the volatility we have been seeing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:21:42
Same to you! :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:24:17
I was born on Friday the 13th... Just got in last week lol 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:35:55
Sure hope so
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:36:35
Uber 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:52:18
Lol idk how to take that man but happy holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:37
Hah exactly. That can also be a way to play through the cost average game 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:06:20
I'm just hoping to pay off 14K in student loans lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:31:25
No more 40K talk
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:54:30
Is this on the their site somewhere? Couldn't find it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:14
Everyone is different
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:21:06
Google coinbase fees 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:35
That might be it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:30:37
Sigh 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:26
As long as they pump me up to student loans being paid off...
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:17:02
Chilling over here. Thinking about doing some YouTube live for those who want to chat up some crypto currency
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:26
Same cause then from PayPal to bank is within mins 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:32:17
102k. 
JK. That was my moon talking 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:03
Lmao hell yeaaaaa
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:38:51
Hehehehe hoooooo
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:20:37
Hah. I thought the same exact thing. Faaaaak 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:35:53
I'm wondering the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:59:46
No it's instant. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:34
I legit feel it's the most well run of all the exchanges honestly. 
I also feel they being open and transparent is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:33:47
Preference based on what tho. I've heard Google will stop supporting chrome apps and isn't the nano based entirely on those apps?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:28
Like I sold some ethereum and then bought bitcoin from my USD wallet
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:24:20
I just stared last week with $100 lol. But I have student loans, car payments, rent etc. If I had 10k and no debt I'd do it. Or at least half. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:36:36
Everyone's comments on here so far are golden. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:23
Dropping hard now 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:23:52
I think it would be dope. Have a rough design? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:47
Nah it's the mirror thing. Lol it's correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:47
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:26:16
Lol no one can guarantee anything. My fear is that once 2018 hit in the states everyone will sell because those gains won't count toward 2017 tax season. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:06
That's just a TAD TOO STRESSFUL
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:06:38
Great read. I was anxious for them just reading along lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:02
Lmao it's already crashed 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:59:24
What about fees tho? You pay a lot to get it moved?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:02:12
Where is everyone seeing this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:17:13
Let's get it!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:13:44
That's. All. I. Do.
I purchased into Bitcoin for the first time last week.. that's all I do now lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:26:48
Haha perfect. I'm always pulling my phone out and checking Bitcoin stuff when no one's looking lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:50
You and me both. My moon is 15k to finish off them student loans
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:32
100 and have added more little by little 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:56
Hmm like 10-20 dollars between credit card fee of 3.99% I think?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:09:39
Thank you very much for this. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:34:10
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:33:57
This. Is my biggest fear when I finally get my HW
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:18:53
The hate is real with this one 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:40
Hell yeaaa
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:36:27
No not at all. Lol. NOT at all. I'm all for only buy what you can afford. Or invest what you can LOSE. All I'm saying is buying with a credit card is helpful for the times I KNOW I'll have the money let's say in 2 weeks (pay day every 2 weeks) but want to buy now for whatever reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:22:51
I've been trying to force myself to check only once and hour. So damn tough. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:52
I can't blame anyone for wanting to better their lives. IDK what other life I may be in after this one, but currently at 29 I have student loans and other debt. If I can pay some or all off, why wouldn't I? The money I save by doing so can go back into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:45
It jumped immediately right back up lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:29
I sure hope it's not lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:44
Lol I am buying. I'm just saying that there's no need to panic. If I'm out the money, I'm out. However, the potential is more than any other bank account etc 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:54:26
Ok. So most of these people worried about how long it's taking to send money form coinbase aren't usually to their Bank accounts, but to other exchanges or hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:38:55
I just got into it. 
However, if I'm ever fortunate enough to see some serious growth.. all I want to do is pay off my car or student loans. Loans at around 14k and car at 24K. 
Not trying to get rich. Not trying to be too greedy. Just one of those and I'd be so stoked. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:45:42
Damn. Mines at $750 but I've been buying up to that limit since I started like 3 weeks ago 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:38:22
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:10:43
My point exactly
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:42
Right. So if I never sell Bitcoin and hodl. But also buy bcash and hodl...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:06
Meantime peeps over at litecoin don't even bat an eye or care there shit popping 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:22:13
My biggest concern is moving Bitcoin from coinbase to a hardware wallet.
If I ever want to sell, what do I do then? Move from wallet back to coinbase or whoever and sell there? Then that USD I transfer to my bank account?
How hard is it to actually MOVE from a place like coinbase or whoever to a hardware wallet and vice versa? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:31:15
That's a good question. 
I just got into Bitcoin last week right after it hit 10K. However, my co-workers have seen me always checking news on Bitcoin etc and have asked me about it and if I've invested. I've just kind of beat around the bush and said I don't know much about it and left it at that lol. Almost like I don't want them to be part of the club IDK 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:43:50
At a boy 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:01
That's it. Exactly my thought process. Currently I Uber when I feel like buying the latest tech and now I'll just use it to Bitcoin it up. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:28:40
Coinbase? Is it working?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:59:18
How long did it take?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:24:16
When was the last time you tried sending to your BoA? No issues?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:23:53
Has anyone sold any to their BoA since this post?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:22:55
Have you tried sending money from Coinbase to your BoA? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:32:01
Has gone up a good bit last hour..
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:24:42
Have you done so again recently?
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:53:46
How long did it take for you to see your purchase on coinbase reflected on your BoA account?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:28:58
Have you sent any money from Coinbase to your BoA recently?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:14:14
Was JUST about to sell all last night.. now that I didn't watch me jinx it all and tumble to like 500
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:54:19
In other words.. act like an eagles fan?
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:54:42
Let it get to 50/60k then I'll bounce cause I'll have hit my moon. I'm not stupid. I like money. I also like technology and wish I could have both. However, Fiat is what drives the world and hey it is what it is 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:21:42
are you still having success sending money from Coinbase to your BoA account?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:28:13
are you still having success sending money from Coinbase to your BoA account?
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:10:28
I love money ��
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:58:44
Just keep on climbing baby..
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:18:46
Was this a Bank of America account? If so, are you still having success sending money from Coinbase to your BoA account?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:24:19
Blah! It's so funny but it's not. Everytime I read someone post stuff like that it happens. Soooooo
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:55:58
Dude. Before visa wasn't charging me transaction fees then for like 2 weeks I got hit with a big transaction fee per purchase. Then visa says no more coinbase purchases and coinbase then says no more credit card purchases. Whatever. I'll just deal with it 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:36:50
Please get me to like 15K so I can pay off my credit cards lol and feel like I've hit sort of my moon ha
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:43:02
Since I sold everything im totally fine with it dropping to like 1k lol
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:57:10
Exactly. I have student loans to pay so yea I'm bouncing the second I can pay it all off or most off. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:27:24
Nothing ever makes it go up or done
