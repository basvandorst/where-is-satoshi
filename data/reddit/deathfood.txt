Pheeva, pay for your own damn commercial. This is seriously one of the worst ways I could think of to promote Bitcoin to a general audience.  And on top of it, it seems desperate and scammy to crowdfund your marketing. Raise some money from investors who believe in you if having a superbowl commercial is a good idea, should be simple, right?

Not an accountant, but I'm pretty sure the rule is: First in First Out.
If you bought one BTC at $10 and then bought another one at $800.
And then you sold one at $800, you'd be liable for the gain on the one bought from $10, as it was your first purchase.  You couldn't claim that the second one you bought at $800 was the one you sold for $800 and therefore a wash.
Again, not a CPA, just my best recollections.  Any CPA's?

I think your accounting here is way too optimistic. 50k barely covers the overhead for one employee (insurance, space, etc..), and these are probably higher compensated employees than average due to many being engineers.
So, I'd start over assuming that the true cost of an average employee (salary, benefits and overhead) is probably closer to $120-$130k.

Should also be noted that they are traveling to CES at the moment.  I would hope when they are on the ground and have more information that they update everyone again.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:46:44
Be a little more speculative, why don't you?
I mean, seriously, they gave an update 3 hours ago.  Are they supposed to give an update every 5 minutes saying, "Still working on it!"?
3 hours of silence is indicative of absolutely nothing.  Stop spreading FUD.

You only need a 2/3rds majority to change the constitution and it has been 24 years since the last time that happened.
It is pretty difficult to achieve 75% consensus on any issue.  As the user base gets larger it will become even more difficult.
Hoping to stick with a 95% consensus when there could one day be 100's of millions of users is pure fantasy.  The only political systems that achieve that are ones that are totally corrupt.

The thing is, what we were always told is that Bitcoin is free from being ruled by a small group of elites because of the fact that "anyone can release a new client".
XT is NOT an alt-coin. It is a new client for Bitcoin.
If we can't have new clients become the standard, then we are stuck with Core forever and at the mercy of a very small group of people who are allowed to make commits to it.
That is not how Bitcoin is supposed to work.

Anyone who doesn't believe the block size is already a problem, probably doesn't do many actual transactions.
Ask any Localbitcoin trader and you'll hear stories of people waiting hours to get in a block for no other reason than lack of space. 
I suspect those that only see this as a theoretical problem and not the real-life use issue that it is, probably spend their time arguing on Reddit or designing vapor-ware solutions for a problem they believe is in the future.
Perhaps some of you people should actually use the currency from time to time instead of just hodling.

No. All You're doing here is restating a well established scientific fact.
Real heroes insist the whole thing was faked and the buildings are still standing.

Heresy! You must state an unequivocal opinion and defend it no matter how much data invalidates it later on.
It is the American way!

Any type of cooperation in the eyes of the Feds is a possible reason to offer a plea bargain.  So the short answer is, yes, they could consider his willingness to turn over his ill-gotten gains in any potential negotiation.
Prosecutors have a lot of discretion when it comes to what charges to pursue, etc... If they can let a murderer off with a life sentence instead of the death penalty for telling them where their victim is buried, I'd imagine allowing DPR to walk earlier than otherwise in exchange for his cooperation on securing the SR funds would not be a hard sell to a judge at all.

A Black-Scholes calculation will come up with different values depending on the inputs. I'm on mobile, but if I remember correctly this reflects an implied volatility of 40-45%?
I've seen underlying assets with a fraction of the historical volatility of ASICMiner go for higher implied vols. 
Considering all the inherent risk factors, and the fact that Puts should be positively skewed, I'd say 65%-85% is maybe fair value.
Just my opinion as a former option market maker

Not to be "that guy", but I guess I'll go ahead and say it.
Maybe you should, you know, tell them?
It's just that there are so few places accepting Bitcoin right now, why would we want to see one of them screwed over in some way?
Perhaps everything is fine, perhaps they aren't really aware of the MTGox issues and have just been accumulating USD over there not knowing that they might not be able to withdraw it.  Do they use the Gox Merchant tools?
You should do them a favor, let them know about it, make sure they are aware of what is up, and suggest ways they could mitigate the problem.  
I'm all for spending Bitcoin, but in this early stage I'd rather companies not have a negative experience with it.  Encountering a customer who was part of a community that wanted to help them fix their issue would go a long way to validating their decision to accept Bitcoin in the first place.
Just sayin'

The Network Effect is a thing.  You cast aside one of the largest advantages that Bitcoin has on any other digital p2p currency.  
It has without a doubt the largest network of them all.  In digital currencies, that is the biggest advantage you can have.  It might be more important than any other feature you could conjure up.

Your analysis also neglects a lot.  Dividend payments aren't the only thing that gives a security value. Heck, most stocks don't pay any dividend, yet still manage to be valued at many multiples of book value.
There are lots of reasons why ASICM has the value it does, dividends are just the easiest to analyze.

Well, as for the exchange related counter-party risk, I'm pretty sure writing an option on BTCT.co requires an escrow. If they go belly up, no guarantee I'd see my premium either. :)
On a related note. I was pursuing options at BTCT and actually purchased sims puts under parity! Locked it in and netted myself a few guaranteed bucks in 9 days!
Now, if only I could make option markets (two-sided) with a reasonable fee through a decent API, I'd be a happy clam too. Would love to see more option activity in the BTC Universe

Confirming that those using Google Authebticator, who are smart enough to not upgrade the app holding the keys to their money until it has been confirmed working as part of their standard operating procedure, were also unaffected.

I bought 12,000 PT shares on July 14th, with no special insider knowledge. I was watching what was happening at Just-Dice.com and took a spec. 
Sometimes it's just a coincidence, ya know?

There is Supply and then there Velocity. Supply in BTC is a constant. If that supply is getting used less (Velocity goes down), then the price suffers from lack of demand. What there is less of in this scenario is transactions. 
With that said, I doubt SR had much to do with this.

You almost got away with this, but I quickly CSI'd your profile and it was sitting there in front of me all along:
You remove the first 3 letters from your name, because of Half-Life 3.
Switch the next two letters and we get "satNameIsHo"
Obviously "Name" is the huge clue that you put in there so we would be able to prove to the world that the riddle has been cracked, so we throw that out and we end up with "satIsHo"
A simple algorithmic rearrangement of those letters reveals who the real Satoshi is, Satoshi.
satIsHo = satoshi
Ergo, mystery solved.  Where do I claim my reward?

If you own a whale-sized Gold position that has been getting pummeled while you pleaded with your broker to give it more time before making you go liquidation-only, there comes a time where "discretion" isn't really the issue anymore. 
Any single large holder would have a tough time being discrete, whether they sold on a Monday afternoon or a Thursday morning. Word spreads, there is blood in the water and all you can do is take your lumps.

You have been caught, Satoshi. Give it up, you must have been working on this by 2003.
