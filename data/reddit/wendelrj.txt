So far I've contacted support 6 times and nothing has been resolved. Xapo is not being trusted as it should. In the emails sent I attached the proof of my bank transfer, but nothing was solved. This is theft for me and I am very disappointed with Xapo.
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:57:39
I'm trying to get their support. I'm already waiting for a week to processing my funds. Has anyone ever experienced this? Their support are terrible. I think that they stolen my funds. 
I'm desperate. I thought Xapo was trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:06:36
I send my e-mail. I will come back here to talk what's happened.

In Brazil, 1-2% extra due to fees is more competitive that 6,5 % IOF (a govenament fee about transaction). Brazil is a shame!

In Brazil, Empiricus Research, a very popular financial consulting, said that Bitcoin was a Bubble (that Bitcoin wasn't a investment...) when the Bitcoin was in $1000 or $ 1200. The analyst from Empiricus Research was fired. After that it was propose an excited debate when Bitcoin was in $2500 between the ex-analyst from Empiricus and Fernando Ulrich ( very influential Austrian Economist in Brazil). The ex-consultant asked apologize to your own clients in the past. Now, when the price is $4000, Empiricus Research, is moving an massively publicity to buy Bitcoin. 
Today, I'm a lucky man for not listening to empiricus and continuing to hodl my coins. 
Rule number 1 - Do not trust anyone. Make your own analysis and build your own strategy.

This guide works for me. Thank you.

Great! =D

If you are in Brasil, try to use Foxbit, NegocieCoins, Bitcointoyou or Arena Bitcoins. In all of that, I haven't had any problems since now. 
Bitinka, I can't rely anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:30:12
Good Luck! lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:38:44
I agree
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:07:10
Please, did you solve your problem? I already used the WB21 6 months ago, everything went well. However, with so many people saying it's SCAM, I'm really too scared to use their services. Please, give us your feedback!
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:25:46
Yes, I agree. I hope Bitinka fix this problem. It has been a problem work with exchanges overloaded. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:44:48
The chance I have is that the localbitcoins can send me an email confirming that there was sale on the site. A third party attesting to the transaction makes it easier for me to go to a court of law.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:33:45


Are bitquick.co reliable?
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:20:12
I showed the proof of the transaction issued by LocalBitcoins almost three weeks ago, but it seems that the bank does not want to accept this voucher. LocalBitcoins says that for security reasons you can not release this user's data. In the meantime, my account is blocked. Has anyone ever been in this situation? How did you prove it? This opens up obstacles that make it impossible to negotiate Bitcoins by bank transfer.

Hello guys,
As an update, I made a post on my blog about this. I discovered many other sellers fell in this blow in Brazil.
Follow the link:
If you do not speak Portuguese, I'm afraid you will not have much interest in this post, now if you come to Brazil and think about buying / selling by LocalBitcoins, please use google translator to interact more about the subject And not fall into the blow.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:48:42
BitINKA, after 12 hours fix the problem. There are a absurd deposit delay in this exchange. Caution!
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:41:42
Yes. It was an account to account transfer in the same bank (Bank of Brasil). I send to my bank a picture that the user upload. But it seems the bank don't respect this. =(

Portuguese: Sim. Após muitos dias, eles creditaram meu depósito em conta. Mas suei tentando resolver com a Jéssica fom Xapo. As exchanges estão sobrecarregadas e isso é um problema. Eu tenho evitado usar a Xapo desde este problema.
Yes. After many days, they credited my deposit into account. But I tried to solve with Jessica fom Xapo. The exchanges are overloaded and this is a problem. I've been avoiding using Xapo ever since.

I think that you saying of this post:

I'll read carefully. 
Thank you!

Is it possible that Bitcoin is being used less? That is, people may be afraid of  SegWit2x or  of Jihan Wuu from Bitmain? I'm seeing Litecoin gaining more and more volume of transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:36:05
Ohhh Men! Why did they do that? How they did that? Did they possible make it  and Bitcoin fees explodes again?  
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:35:41
Valeu cara. Enquanto tiverem esses espertinhos no Brasil, fica difícil fazer qualquer tipo de transação em bancos brasileiros. Fica como aviso aos demais usuários que usam o LocalBitcoins.com;

Hi my friend. I have already had the same problems that you sufferring. I decided to use Bitex.la exchanges that accepts WB21 transfers. Could it good for you?
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:30:10
Yes. You have to put the reference and the number account correctly as Bitex.la show you. One observation is that deposits and withdraws are make on the bussiness hours in the week. I supose that they in UTC -3:00. Só, you have to pen attention it. Sorry for my bad English, I'm portuguese speaker, I've been learned English.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:10:08
When I see this post, I remember that I have to practice my English. 
I was not lucky and I was born in a Portuguese speaking country. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:14:47
Are you from Brasil? I'm not available too.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:07:01
Brazilians don't have options. There is a deep economic crisis here. I've even thought about leaving the country. This is a great opportunity.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:27:27
If you discover any other exchange that accept WB21, please talk to me. Good luck!

To say that we are in a bubble is very difficult, just as it is very difficult to know when the Bubble will burst, if it will burst. The fact is that since Bitcoin was worth $ 30 was said to be a bubble and today is at $ 2800. Can there be correction in price? Of course. But a crash of high proportions is unlikely at this time (Do not get me wrong, this is my humble opinion). See our colleague's chart. The interesting thing is that Bubble has become equal to the concept of fascism in politics. That is, if someone is against a controversial opinion, it is said that who said is facist. In Bitcoin, who lost the high tide, says that it is a bubble. Yes, if it is, it can burst, but it can reach $ 10,000 in a few years, and the same guy says it's a bubble. You see?. Have you thought if you believed every time they tell you Bitcoin is a bubble? You would have today only your $ 30 from the sale early on. When it comes to the book, from the reading I made, it is perfectly normal that when the price of an asset rises sharply, the volume in the transactions tends to fall. Think of the infinite, if Bitcoin tomorrow cost $ 1 million, not everyone would be able to buy 1 Bitcoin, the volume, the liquidity of the asset, tends to decrease. You see? I advise you to always be aware of the market cap. For example, I understand that Ripple is a bubble and I do not trust this token to be in my custody (See Ripple the market cap, it's strange!). Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Portuguese speaking country. I'm still learning English.

Good Observation. Sorry for my bad English, I'm a brazilian portuguese speaker. I recommend you to read the book "Boom Bustology" ( In the book the author talk about your observation. It's normal When the prices go up, the transaction volume go down, if the market is not in a bubble.
