if your card offers perks (flyer miles etc) youre most likely paying a fee. 
With credit you are borrowing money which you have to pay back.  Then you have to pay interest.  With debit cards there is usually an account fee for your bank account and deposits take a day (minimum) to confirm in your account. Not to mention they have your money and are making interest off it.  
Remember when we had to bail them out because they fucked off with our money? Oh theres another fee in the form of taxes.
Many places give cash discounts because of cc processing fees. Never seen a "pay with visa" discount.

And that makes it easier for carders to fraud. 
2. Monthly fees are usually pretty easy to avoid. With direct deposit or an average monthly balance, most accounts waive fees.
Oh right like the atm fee? Or the cash advance fee? 
3. All you need to enter is your credit card number. You still have to provide address details when paying with BTC, right?
And then they can take that credit card number and reuse it.. with bitcoin you give a PUBLIC key to BE PAID. With credit you give a PRIVATE KEY to PAY. 
4. Most banks/cards offer protection against all fraud.
Yea and they shut down your account for a week and make you prove it was fraud and then when you DO prove it, the business has to pay because they lost their goods when they gave it to the fraudster and got the money revoked.  
5. I don't think bank employees are looking up your transactions or anyone's for that matter. Fraud detection is generally automatic. 
Yes they do. Regardless, irrelevant. 
6. I have read about this happening occasionally but this sounds like a rare scenario most people won't deal with. 
Sounds like a rare scenario but isnt.

Use circle and verify a debit or credit card. Better prices, less wait. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 02:36:32
So as far as I know in my state they don't charge tax as long as they don't ship it to me from my state?

I couldn't figure out WHY to use it. It was saying 30% off Amazon but when I was looking stuff was more expensive than amazon. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 08:24:07
Coin base is cheaper price than circle, but circle has no fee so in the end is the cheaper choice.
Coin base takes a week unless you verify a credit card (not a debit card). 
Circle if you verify a debit or credit card they will give you $100 instant buy. If you message them on twitter they'll increase your instant buy.
