You see how I said SAR is flagged and CTR? "It would flag an SAR"
Mentioning both items in the context of BSA is necessary. But really it sounds like this guy/gal was up to fuckery from the beginning with putting student loans on the memo line as if that would help him/her. Knowing how the banking system works is a useful adult skill.

Do you understand the math here? I'm not sure that you do. You are doing 1:1 ratios of valuation and that isn't how this works. 
Let's say someone drops a grand into a penny shit coin. If it goes up to a nickel that same week they have gained 5x their investment. If someone put a grand into bitcoin in December they have not gained 5x their investment. That doesn't seem to hard to figure out. 
You are also assuming that total supply is necessary to value a coin. It is not. Do not get caught up thinking a coin is stock. Stock has many things working towards its value. Crypto has daily volume and an underlying tech platform. Supply and demand play a huge role here.
It's a lot easier and more probable for someone to buy a shitload of 3 cent coins, even if they have 1 billion tokens, and hope the coin shoots to $5 than to buy a bitcoin at 15k (just using whole coins for this example) and get the same gains. 
In the last 45 days i've made exponentially more from shitcoins than btc. Lots of people have. I apologize if you are a kid and this seemed harsh. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:16:45
This is part of BSA. They must fill SAR and CTR depending on the customer and amount. Since you probably do not negotiate 20k items often or at all it would flag an SAR (suspicious activity report) in the system. The compliance officer has to do diligence on the item. Doing all of this electronically will make wait times shorter. This is due to fraud and money laundering.

@_date: 2018-01-04 04:59:29
Does it matter? Let's say you dropped $250 on a coin and got 20k coins. That's about 1 penny per coin. Then the price goes up to $25. That's worth $500k USD. Pretty damn good for a measly $250 USD investment. Arguably more than anyone who is solely invested in BTC will realize within a decade or longer.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:50:30
Just asking does it matter if say TRX reaches 1000. If someone dropped 300 and got 4-4.5k tokens when it was below a nickel then if it hits 800 per token that's great. Just doing math in my head but I think that's over 3 million in gains. I just don't understand the argument going on here I suppose. 
Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Lots of people are bad at math or scared of numbers. Not every coin has to be 15k for it to be a great deal for someone. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:24:55
Take no offense but that is a tiny amount of money. I wouldn't be concerned with where I buy BTC with a $200 stake. There is a serious time value element to BTC in that it keeps going up after mild dips. At most you'd yield maybe $10. Point is that the % of a BTC you'll buy is so small that you don't have to worry about timing like say if you were dropping $5k on it.

Nothing in this response is close to my experience or really anyone else that I know. Do you live in an area where home prices are super inflated? In a previous reply I gave you numbers from MY experience. What is your experience? Are you a homeowner? Renter? Do you hate homeownership? I had a difference of $5k per year rent  vs mortgage for the same size house. In fact I bought a home in the area I was going to rent. Downside is that my house only sold for a few hundred more than what I paid for it, but I didn't lose money paying rent each year and I didn't some close to even 1 year's worth of rent in repairs and improvements. 
You do realize cap gains is only on the gain right? Not the full 130k you sell the house for. Interest is tax deductible. You can get a USDA zoned home and avoid PMI.

well we weren't talking about Eth but sure why not. I never mentioned it so you shouldn't extrapolate where my logic starts and stops. Tossing the name bitcoin in your name is definitely a way of getting carried. Do you not agree? I am not opposed to Bcash in principle. Competition will either make BTC better or it will be replaced. But using the brand name is definitely a rip-off. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:44:41
This makes no sense. 
So taxable incomes are cash events, which are calendar year. Unless you are special and use a fiscal year. So selling your bitcoin AFTER 12/31/2017 and BEFORE 1/1/2019 is an economic event for 2018. You'll pay those taxes 4/15/2019.

This is flat out wrong and bad advice. Market cap is not the end all be all of evaluating a currency. For Ripple to be successful it will have to be adopted by a lot of the big banks. If that happens then the price of Ripple will be in the triple digits. There is no other way to facilitate payments, currency xfers, and other banking business with a low value token at even Ripple's volume. Using market cap to evaluate the top end potential of Ripple is pure FUD. You have to look at it in context.
Too many ppl look at market cap for currencies the same as if it is stock in a public corporation. It isn't the same. For me market cap has been good for 2 things in crypto: seeing which are low and pointing me towards whitepapers since a crypto sub 100MM market cap has a lot of exponential growth potential and secondly being a quick estimate of the size of the crypto market as a whole.

I'm quite certain 5 years of rent is more expensive than paying capital gains on an appreciation of the real property. If you are lucky you'll pay 20% on $20k in 5 years? To top it off a mortgage is cheaper than rent in my area. You'd have to be pretty bad with money to decide to drop 6-8k per year more on rent to keep options open. 
Goes without saying that if you choose to live like a gypsy or just are a very transient person then the premium that comes with rent is necessary. At no point is rent a better financial decision. I get that it's necessary for some people but if you want to drop 20k then do it on something that will hopefully retain value if not grow in value. 
What does their age have to do with it? If their credit is poor and their financial situation is seemingly poor then it's solid advice. Paying rent doesn't improve either of those 2 things. Been there done that. 
Very much disagree on the 10 years part. I used this in another reply but the cost difference between rent and a mortgage in my area 10 years ago was about $550. That's inclusive of my property taxes and insurance. Let's just call it $6k per year. Over the course of just 3 years that's an extra $18k paid out. That to me seems wasteful.
Home ownership much like renting isn't for everyone. I've worked with some pretty smart people who have hated one or the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:00:00
if you've been purchasing for years then it is safe to assume you've held the asset greater than a year. it isn't hard to track what you have purchased in this calendar year. the annoying part will be determining the gains on what you purchased prior to 2017. you can't take a position that you purchased 70% of your wallet prior to 2017 but take out most of the gains in this calendar year. does that make sense?
crypto is still a grey area in this regard. the fact you can mine it and that the block chain tracks it all adds a few layers to this new paradigm. 
my advice is to keep it as simple as possible. when you get too cute you get billed more by your CPA and the IRS loves it when you are cute.

So you will either pay tax as ordinary income or capital gains. Cap gains are when you hold the asset for greater than 365 days. 
Even if you did withdraw prior to 365 days then you are liable for ordinary income liability which is a graduated scale so you don't just look at the top bracket and calculate on your entire wallet. 
Who told you this? Some old person that is afraid of math and ups the tax/depreciation in each subsequent convo or some clueless soul on facebook? This is like hearing someone who believes a car depreciates 75% as soon as it is driven off of the lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:07:29
I have to disagree here. I live in a rather poor state with one of the lowest costs of living and rent is as much or more than my mortgage. Anecdotal sure but before we bought our first house we hadn't considered a mortgage. When looking at homes less than 1100 square feet, rent was easily $1,200 per month in our area. Way over what we wanted to budget. My first home had a mortgage with escrow was about $750 per month. Like OP we had nearly $20k to put down on the home. I know people around me that pay more in rent than my mortgage + escrow. At the end of the day I'm investing in something I own and can sell for what I paid for the asset or even more. Of course in some cases the price goes down but then you are on the same footing as a renter since you have nothing to show for it. 
Home repairs are overblown too. Major appliances and HVAC can be pricey but do not occur on a routine basis. For major events you have insurance, plus for now you get a tax benefit for having a mortgage. Rent could be jacked up 10% per year to cover these things. 
There are legit cases for renting but long term it would be hard to make the case that it is the more economically sound decision. Especially the last few years with super low interest rates. I just can't agree that paying rent allows you to take advantage on investments when in my experience it just flat out costs more.

which part? a large supply dumped onto the market causing volatility or the existence of the wallet? i haven't verified for myself the wallet exists but it seems to be common knowledge. a large supply of coins would definitely effect the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:17:19
what i like about bitcoin is the seemingly nondescript community that supports it and gives it value. with this guy, Ver, you have someone who just seems like a rager pushing some modified crypto and goes out of his way to shit all over bitcoin. i mean if he has something better then people will use it. but there are lots of people who are invested deeply into bitcoin for many reasons and would prefer this guy not to shit all over their investments. also wanting rules on an exchange vs the financial system as a whole are 2 different things. i think it's a good idea that a public facing company like coinbase would have some strict rules about employee trading. it just seems reasonable. of course if that's anathema to a large portion of the community then another large successful public exchange will open up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:02
I'm in full agreement that the fees are outrageous. I wanted to dump less than 200 on an alt coin but the fee was 25. I'm not doing that. So I used LTC instead. Easy to get and easy to spend. 
I'm just saying Litecoin and Eth both have lower fees and faster times. Neither have Bitcoin in the name, so on the face of it, bcash feels not genuine and inflated due to the name and not its utility. Like a knockoff game console sold at a dollar store. Sure it plays games, and some might be fun, but it's not the genuine thing.

if it's a long term thing then really any time is fine. Don't take this the wrong way but you only dropped 1k. So buying at 9600 or 9100 won't matter much. If you were dropping 10s of thousands then maybe the difference starts to become material. This is all of course relative to your situation and goals. Maybe an extra $25 is worth you waiting a week for a dip or something.

idk what's up with the not being able to purchase but the limit is a weekly thing. mine began at 2500. So if on a Monday I used 2500 on BTC then each day I get a few hundred back in my limit. Same with the CC purchases. Maybe you are seeing what is freed up and able to be used vs an actual lowering? I don't know why you can't make a purchase at all.
I will say this though. The exchanges have to follow many of the same rules banks do. BTC has an earned stigma of being used to launder and hide funds. So the limits and restrictions they put in place especially on new accounts aren't that different from many other institutions. As time goes on your account will have greater limits etc. I think Coinbase is a good service, but quite expensive to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:39:54
the marketcap number will fluctuate. So for instance you can have a MAGA uncle who thinks your $1 coin is only worth a nickel. That doesn't mean you adjust your market cap to what he thinks the value is. The market sets the value. The exchanges all carry a consistent market value so we can extrapolate the value amongst the entire population. If anything we should probably determine what % of mined coins are permanently lost due to lost keys or corrupted HDD. These unusable coins actually bring the value down by inflating the supply.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:32:04
the rise could be the correction due to the fluff known as bitcoin cash for about a week.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:42:51
I think it is an amalgamation of both functions. There is a mathematical limit to the supply. There is a limit to the shares a company has, and limits on the class of shares. All class A shares are valued at X and so on. So all BTC are valued at the same value. This is kind of warped since a BTC isn't technically a share but english is a descriptive language so it really does make sense. 
I'm okay with lay terms and understanding for crypto. We need everyone in this thing so we can have lambos in every color.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:03:15
This is a normal accounting/auditing tool. Nothing interesting at the 20k threshold. There is literally not enough time in the day or personnel on staff to go over accounts that do not meet that threshold. In auditing it's called materiality. You don't investigate things below materiality. 
I'd imagine worldwide the % of wallets that hold BTC with greater than 1 BTC is less than 2%. So by trimming this even further to say .001% of users just on coinbase it becomes much more manageable to perform procedures to determine Coinbase's compliance with regs and to screen money laundering etc. 
Lay people can't distinguish between a forensic audit and a GAAP-GAAS Audit.

What you want is a tax attorney and not a CPA. Unless there is a really rational position you can take then ethically you side with caution. You can also file your own taxes and do as you wish but will have to deal with the ramifications of the IRS disagreeing with you. Crypto is becoming material in value, so I'd expect more revenue rulings on this over the next 2-4 years. 
There just hasn't been guidance on the definitions and treatment of crypto. 
I'll reiterate, I won't risk my license because a client wants to be aggressive in an event when there isn't very much guidance to frame a reasonable position on. That last part is key, you have to have a reasonable position. In this circumstance without much guidance the tax attorney is better suited for this. I'm sure the tax attorney wouldn't mind the fee. That's how these things get revenue rulings anyway.

as a CPA this is prudent. I can't afford to lose my license so that a client can realize an additional 4%. As a professional I do my best to minimize a tax liability but I draw the line at illegality. Ethically I can't knowingly take a fraudulent position.

That's entirely not what this is about. There are laws and protections surrounding credit card uses and purchases.

put it in a safe deposit box at a bank about 20 mins from  your house. it will be too inconvenient for knee jerk reactions.

Look at it this way. It's safer to keep the Nano off site in case of robbery or a fire. Granted you have the seed but keeping the hardware safe is a great idea too. It's also considerably less technical and one less thing for you to flub up and risk locking yourself out of your crypto :P

I see no problems with not being able to use a credit card to purchase a crypto. I'm sure there are plenty of assholes demanding refunds with those cc purchases.
