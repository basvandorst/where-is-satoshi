Never asked for it to be free. Bitcoin has been cheap before, why can't it have those fees again? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:17:40
Yeah if any exchange is still supporting that trading pair
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:01:28
I mean if you have bitcoin why would you need US dollars in Venezuela 
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:08:06
So.... market forces?
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:43:06
Exponentially increase the price? In relation to what? Fiat? Who the fk cares about its value in fiat. The point is to not use fiat ever again.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:58:40
Again with the bullshit socialist argument...
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:59:49
Convert to US dollars? What the fuck is wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:59:35
Because then we'd have lower fees
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:41:14
No it won't, it'll readjust after 2016 blocks
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:45:34
3rd party wallet... not exchange. Technically you don't even need that wallet. You just need to have BOTH wallets
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:46:44
That's sooooo much better. ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:58:05
Nothing will change. But if you have your private keys, you can spend the equivalent amount on the same address on a Bitcash wallet
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:34:02
Yep, you're right.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:29:19
Right, my request for low fees is completely unreasonable. I can't wait to pay &gt;1k sats/byte for a tx.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:29:36
I got the sarcasm but in the "American" version, you'd still die because you can't afford it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:50:23
So with that logic, we should all be hoarding bitcoin and do nothing with it?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:38:14
But you'd have to do it just once, and never look back.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:31:36
They're taking our jobs!
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:36:29
Sorry but I don't get what the fuss was with coinbase? Why are they being blamed? I got the email from them and withdrew my BTC immediately, it got 6 confirmations in a couple hours...
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:31:09
It's not that the train got larger, they just shifted things around in that train so slightly more people can fit in it
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:57:04
High fees on BTC has nothing to do with BCH. I've been holding out my coins since way before the fork. Fees were atrocious then too. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:59:28
You mean USD reached all time low?
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:18:46
Blockstream is behind the wheel. I mean they're all bitcoin holders right? So they have a huge stake in the value of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:08:56
What's missing in his explanation is that when more people want to buy than sell, price goes up. When less people want to buy than sell, price goes down.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:11:22
Trade that car for a new one. That's the point, market chooses the better product.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:47:58
It kinda does, you get dump the flat tire, and get a newer better one.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:46:40
Literally everything wrong with BTC is 'part of an attack'. Jesus Christ you guys... accept your mistakes and fix them... I have a bunch of high input wallets I can't move because of these fees.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:06:15
You mean a $200 1TB hard drive? That will last at least 2 decades. Oh no, how will the average person run a node... (my prices aren't right, but the point is, the 'more resources' you're talking about is just storage space, which is dirt cheap.)
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:24:29
I used to give out $10+ worth of BTC to get the ball rolling with my friends. We've used exclusively cryptos when transacting with each other. Now we've moved to vertcoin, but I still have a decent stash of BTC I'm holding out.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:27:13
Bitcoin is nothing like fiat. A simple test is, can you make more bitcoin from NOTHING? No. You can't. You need to spend a shitload of electricity just to make 50 coins. Normal fiat can be printed limitlessly at no cost, or even more through creating credit. That's the difference. Learn it before investing in bitcoin/cryptos.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:00:05
That video is really good. It simplifies the underlying technology without being too technical.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:53:07
I know I should do this but jesus I'm a lazy fuck. I always send thousands of dollars worth of BTC on the first try.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:53:47
Test comment
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:49:01
Even before the 'attack' fees were fucking insane...
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:30:17
Erm no? If you believe that 2x isn't the way to go, mine the 1x chain then.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:46:40
How is it hostile? Hard forking to upgrade the network is how satoshi described it right? A 51% attack is only for dishonest miners who wish to double spend. But if there is consensus to use a new protocol, then that's just another day in the Open Source world.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:24:30
Wrong, a hardfork can be done by anyone, it's just a matter of who is willing to adopt it. If there's consensus, then it will be adopted. That's how decentralisation works. Not just one Dev team calling the shots. Anyone can fork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:28:17
2x IS BTC... it's a network upgrade.. why is everyone so resistant to upgrading the network capacity? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:42:03
Wrong it's an upgrade.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:28:43
That's how it works mate. Look it up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:34:05
No replay protection is not an issue, because it's an UPGRADE, you don't want to have split chains. You'd one the majority to be running new consensus rules and the minority will be orphaned. That's how upgrades work. Orphaned transactions will not be an issue as they'll also be in the 2x blocks. In fact 2x will be clearing the mempool faster than 1x. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:12:53
In other words, the fear-mongering worked.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:08:29
The small guy can still run SPV nodes. There's no reason to run full nodes if you're not mining. Where were you guys when mining was becoming centralised?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:46:38
How do you know nobody wants this? What's the mechanism for gauging sentiment? This echo chamber?
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:53:39
But when the miners decided to run a different version (2x), you snowflakes cried that it's an attack. Can't have it both ways cuck.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:41:22
But odds are 2x txns will confirm first right? Since 90% of miners are gonna mine it
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:02:19
Instead we have 4 people on a sketchy dev team that decides what is or isn't bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:47:23
Against the wishes of the network? 90% of the network has signaled to change the protocol. So who's wishes are they against? The 10%?
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:19:42
That's not how it works. You said it costs nothing. So, signal away!
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:19:31
Hard forks don't need backwards compatibility. You expect everyone to keep up or get left behind.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:43:08
Technically only one chain as the minority chain will just die off
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:52:08
Really? Ok go ahead and signal for me. Don't forget to link the block you signaled in. Since its sooooo free.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:51:19
You mean to the repo that will never accept bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:03:03
The takeover attempt has been completed with the kicking of gavin 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:07:01
Miners make the network, everything else is irrelevant... Consensus can only be judge surely with hashpower. Community/dev etc can be manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:29:40
Core dev working on bigger blocks? Hilarious. Don't be naive kid.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:45:05
Businesses that gave bitcoin its value over the years? Business whom without them bitcoin might not have ever reached its current height? Cool. Shit on those guys for adding value to your investment.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:32:25
SPV nodes can validate every block just fine
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:36:12
You're totally missing the point... 4 is too few... nobody can go against their 'vision'. Its very centralised. Fear-mongering I'm talking about refers to Core's fear of larger blocks. When clearly it can be done without any security issues. It's just that larger blocks conflict with their interest in selling their centralised lightning hubs.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:00:04
Like lightning hubs?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:41:47
far easier to manipulated a closed group of developers than a decentralised community of miners.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:16:53
Nah, I'm good. It's just that you guys have a problem with few people controlling the mining, but are totally ok with only 4 developers having commit rights. Developers who have a clear conflict of interest with scaling bitcoin too. So yeah, be a hypocrite somewhere else? Or can we have a logical discussion in here some day?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:55:15
Nothing is stopping you from mining 1x just as how miners are free to mine 2x
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:52:29
Or you could say that dominance dropped to 62% over the last few years
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:47:40
Wanting to see bitcoin scale to VISA levels is anti-bitcoin? Cool.
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:08:05
It's a self-signed root certificate. Anyone can make one
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:54:08
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:06:43
Depends how secure your safe is?
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:00:46
Everything is an attack on bitcoin to you fucks
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:05:41
But don't low fee txns get removed from the mempool? Could I just send a 0 fee transaction and show the driver "look I've sent the btc" knowing it'll be removed after a sometime
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:01:29
No, barter with commodity money is not idiotic. Using fiat has made you think so. Bitcoin can be treated as a commodity as it can't be freely created.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:10:56
No it's more like a wanted poster cos he's known to have double spent before
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:02:44
Oh, can I mine bitcoin now? I have a GTX1080 and practically free electricity
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:42:30
Who says I'm a fan of fiat? I'm just stating reality AT THE MOMENT. You can't live off bitcoin. Obviously I hope that changes one day.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:13:03
Sell all your fiat for bitcoin. Survive the next month without converting bitcoin to fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:58:01
Fiat to BTC on ramps follow KYC/AML laws
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:57:53
Sounds like an American problem lol. The rest of the world doesn't have shitty internet.
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:29:00
I guess there was no economy in the millennias of human civilisation before fiat?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:47:53
Sometimes a little too straightforward for the real world
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:12:14
So &gt;90% of miners is not broad support?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:50:27
His brother runs BTCC. They could have easily coordinated the news and shorting the market. Not saying they did, but they could've.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:40:17
Are you mining bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:10:05
How can you tell if a node has "actual users"?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:47:53
Sometimes a little too straightforward for the real world
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:10:00
A network with only validating nodes but no miners is worthless. But a network with only miners but no validating-only nodes still works. Don't inflate the value of full non-mining nodes. They're good to have but not essential. All full nodes could die tomorrow and bitcoin will still move on.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:38:20
News flash buddy. Bitcoin is ALREADY centralised.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:41:03
But it's literally the same coin? With just double the capacity. How will 1x be more profitable when the fees miners get per block will just double.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:03:53
It's enough if you move a nice cheap country Central or SouthEast Asia. You can easily live with 30k a year VERY comfortably. That's roughly 30 years of income, possibly more if you spend less.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:52:29
The better analogy would be that the S2X miners decide to dig down twice as fast and get twice as many BTC, while the 1X miners struggle to get past the first block. No replay protection means they're basically the same coin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:20:24
So that means s2x has consensus? Since everyone is going there?
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:26:37
So he's a fan of faster transactions and lower fees? Big deal.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:41:14
What? What if we need to hard fork to upgrade the network as a whole? Are hard forks permanently evil now in your world?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:50:27
His brother runs BTCC. They could have easily coordinated the news and shorting the market. Not saying they did, but they could've.

Do you have the private key for each wallet? Not your keys, not your coin.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:09:08
But when nobody is mining it, how will we send our money?
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:03:24
At the cost of decentralisation? Are you a miner? Can a regular joe like me mine? The cost has already been paid. You need specialised equipment to mine, so why not make transactions dirt cheap while we're at it...
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:14:10
Are you a miner? Are you contributing to the hashpower? I got more news for you... Your voice don't matter if you don't mine.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:14:54
They could've artificially increased the price of bitcoin by buying bitcoin with allegedly fraudulent tethers.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:07:16
Have you at least cashed out your initial investments? I've done that and I'm waaaay more at ease with the volatility since I'm playing with house money.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:35:17
What if I want 2mb blocks? Smaller fees no?
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:36:55
Can't blame anyone there but themselves though. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:32:01
Funny you say that when LN is basically what PayPal is. Limiting onchain txns for the sake of it what will CENTRALISE bitcoin much further. If usage ever increases to VISA levels, we are fked. There'll be no space in the block to clear the mempool ever.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:13:16
But how will I withdraw my original 1mb token if the hashrate goes to &lt;5%? 3 hour block times?
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:39:24
Would you rather have 1kg of Gold or 1kg of plastic?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:19:08
A person who disagrees with the main narrative.
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:22:30
But must LN come with a limited blocksize? If it gets too congested I'll be forced to used a centralised, privately owned network... which obviously we'd like to avoid as much as possible...
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:30:36
Try harder mate. I run a full node, but I don't mine. If I stop running my node, NOTHING CHANGES. Get this, nobody gives a fuck about your shitty node. Only those who add to the PoW bring value to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:00:40
No, but since we're already fucked, why not get ~~cheap~~ faster transactions and lower fees? Face it bitcoin as a tech sucks compared to some other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:31:13
How are they scammy?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:10:11
They're getting twice as much fees. And you're right, they're not mining twice as fast. With 90+% hashpower, they'll mine 9 times as fast as 1x.
And you're judging the future price based on ONE futures market on one shady exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:51:11
Yeah for sure. The ringgit has tanked more than 50% over the past few years. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:00:58
The utility IS the intrinsic value.. wtf. Do you even know what intrinsic means? It's the value that it inherently has. Not like fiat, where the value is what is declared on the piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:14:28
What he's saying that a rising fee isolates more users from using the system. Who can afford to use bitcoin when the fees get too high? Only the rich.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:43:47
You're right, I did. LMAO ma bad
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:26:12
You're just wording it differently, yes 2x will be 10% slower, but 1x will be 90% slower. So tell me which chain is gonna get fked harder?
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:36:49
Ooh I didn't know that was a thing. Are these features available in most wallets? Or do you need some obscure tinkering to use them?
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:50:44
No they're not. Hashpower = votes. No hashpower, no say. If you're not actively strengthening the actual blockchain, why do you deserve a vote? You're just a leech.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:08:10
They're forking to upgrade the bitcoin network
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:27:40
But those who actually CREATE blocks and put in proof of work are the ones adding value? Why should freeloading nodes get any say? They're just validating blocks, which miners are ALSO doing anyways.
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:47:47
I haven't seen any S2X folks claiming that. The only thing I know for sure is that 95+% of miners are supporting it, and that's consensus to me.
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:50:49
What about the high fees? Max block size increase does not mean that all blocks will be 8mb. It just means there's room for more if needed.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:05:32
Move some of your portfolio into DPoS type assets and gain dividends.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:01:53
So wanting faster transactions and lower fees is 'attacking' bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:31:45
Dollars are backed by oil, weapons and the blood of middle eastern children...
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:47:02
No, like NEO and Ark
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:15:10
Ok, we'll see.
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:29:02
Actually that's incorrect. Its value is intrinsic and in its rarity. Fiat has value only because we deem it to. You can't duplicate gold or crypto (finite amounts) but you can print an infinite amount of fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:24:34
BTC makes money from electricity... you can't make infinite bitcoins because power is finite... but you can make unlimited fiat cos all it takes is to print the value on the damn paper 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:00:43
I think it's 100 blocks not days
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:08:33


LMAO. Look up the Nixon Shock. How about you get a proper education.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:29:32
The total value of both coins will be less than the original single coin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:26:33
Regardless, the block chain has value because of the hashpower put into it, and the coins are finite.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:42:02
Why does it matter? You wanna sell your coins for fiat in the future?
