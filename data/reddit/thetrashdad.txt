Why three years?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:18:33
I'm not speculating.  I'm not doing this to get rich, but I want to make sure I don't miss the train.  It's hard to turn down when they're this cheap.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:30:01
It seems like everyone else is recommending circle.  I'm a bit confused now.  I guess I need to test the water on both.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:31:38
I'm looking at the same thing.  My only negative is it seems like a *very* expensive way to protect my money especially for less than $1000 in bitcoins.  At $1000, that's like 10% security fee.  I'm doing this to get away from bank fees, not spend more.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:58:28
I'm thinking of moving 10% of it over.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:27:22
I cannot wait to see this succeed. This is how our parents and grandparent and further back just have felt during the during the civil rights movement or the repealing of prohibition. I feel like I'm a part of something much bigger than myself and I wish I could do more than just buy coins.
The people who don't buy in will be the one looking back in regret and the ones history will mention as a footnote.

This is what's great about this community.  People are willing to share and give to make it better.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:29:02
This is what I'm probably going to do.  
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:16:35
So what gives them value?  I kept asking my friend this and he really couldn't give me a good answer.  Or maybe he gave me a great answer and I just didn't get it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:21:01
How can they even put apple pay in the same category as the block chain?
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:46:41
Taking the advice from the other person, I might look at the trezor for biggest long term stuff but right now I am using mycelium for stuff I want to play with.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:57:17
If they move the coins, will it affect price?  I think no which means maybe nothing?  Though there's a possibility it spooked a few people to sell.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:45:31
Thanks.  I'm going to check out the trezor.  I'm not a put the cash under the mattress kind of guy but I'm not the most computer savvy person.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:26:06
That is really cool.  Now if I can just find something to do with it.  Heh.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:22:05

You cannot make an omlette without breaking an egg.  And you cannot make a family size omelette without breaking a dozen.  This is one of the most amazing technologies.   It has no choice but to go up!  
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:43:52
I wish I could make that face a lot more often.  I've down a bit and I tried to talk to my brother about it.  All he focused on was the price.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:50:38
Do you think it'd be too complex for most people?
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:27:26
I said it elsewhere but this makes me nervous.  I don't want to get robbed.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:51:39
Well, the reunion is still some ways away.  If I order pizza now, it might be moldy. ;)

Thank you very much!
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:37:41
Just think about how cool it would be to work at a company that's thinking forward and really embracing bitcoin technology.  We *need* more of this.  Microsoft is cool, but are they holding any?  Are they really believers or just another corporation trying to cash in on a growing trend?
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:50:22
Why not?  If he can tell me about his kid using the potty why can't I talk about things I'm interested in?  What if I was collecting coins or stamps?  Should I not talk about that too?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:24:04
It's a euphemism.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:08:36
You and me both!  Here's a few more to take down with us.

@_date: 2015-01-08 16:38:30
That's cool.  I'm excited to try this out.  I'm hoping Sony follows suit soon or maybe I just need to get an xbone.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:37:26
And each day more and more are accepting it.  The moon isn't the end.  It's just a stop on a much larger journey!

Thank you for keeping this alive even in these dark times!  You sir are what makes this community great!
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:55:32
Forever is a long time, but I imagine the moon is somewhere in between now and then.  Cheer up!

It's just more fear and uncertainty.  People want bitcoin to fail, and I don't know why.  It seems like people are really scared of a change that can make their lives better.  People call us a cult when they should look at us as enlightened!
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:16:28
Just another stepping stone into the future of bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:25:16
Is gold to big to fall?  Bitcoin isn't too big to fail, it's too big not to succeed. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:28:48
I'm thinking of buying a trezor since everyone recommends it.  I just need to get enough coins that justifies it.  I mean why spend $100 securing $10?
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:20:19
Why are you such a jerk?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:51:10
Good idea.  Don't want to this to be a rocket that fails to take-off!
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:20:55
You don't think banks and the government silence us with money?  This is our chance to be on the forefront of both a technological and social change.
Maybe you need to look past your shackles and see the chance in front of you. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:29:58
Why do you have to be a jerk?  I'm trying to share something I'm interested in with my family.  What's wrong with that?  A lot of people shared email when they first got it.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:18:03
You think it'll be good to hold and it'll go back up soon?
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:56:39
Cultish?  There's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about something that interests you.  Are people who buy gold and silver a cult?  They're passionate about it.
Microsoft doesn't believe in it.  They don't care if bitcoin succeeds.  They aren't investing in it as a technology both for themselves or the future.  They could do so much more to make bitcoin such a success.  That's where Overstock is different.  They're embracing it and trying to grow the economy of it.
I'm sorry you don't see this the same way.  I'm only just learning about bitcoin and I see it being some an amazing technology.  But if big players don't support it, it will never achieve what it could be.
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:35:53
This is something I love. Everyone cares and wants to share. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:46:58
I think it's because Apple paid.  You can't compare the two - there's nothing new about apple pay unlike bitcoin which is a revolution of technology. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:49:11
Not sure what you mean?
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:31:31
You seen to be just looking for rations to be angry and down. Did you want to see them fail?  That'd do nothing but hurt real people and the bitcoin community as a whole. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:23:58
It is.  Someone else sent me $5.00 before, it was nice because it let me play with a bit without worrying about fees eating up all the money.
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:35:15
It is quite possibly the coolest thing I've ever done myself. I just bought from coinbase and it is amazing. I have a family reunion coming up. Just dreaming of ways to share it with my family!
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:48:57
Android.  I setup a wallet using mycelium.  I think I did it right and send coins from my changetip account to it.  Can you tell me if I did it right?  Here's my [wallet](
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:40:37
Ha are you my friend?  I'm starting to learn a bit about this but I'm finding most people don't want to hear about it.  My friend at a party was doing his usual dance and people just kept saying they weren't interested in a scam.
So far bitcoin seems neat but I'm still reading.  I think might purchase some soon.  Who knows, maybe I'll be that guy next!
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:45:39
It's proof we're succeeding because a lot of people who installed the western union app have also installed the wallet. Proof bitcoin is killing wu!

@_date: 2015-01-07 17:18:17
This was neat.  Now that I've followed the link do I not have bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:12:15
Just seems like more proof that bitcoin is going more mainstream. I'm becoming more excited to be a part of this.

Shriners are great!  They really helped my cousin.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:22:35
Thanks.  Why would I buy gift cards?  Wouldn't it be easier to try to talk local businesses into accepting it?
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:15:10
Interesting.  Is it easy to talk small business into accepting it?
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:18:33
I don't know if we will be able to express it in a way we really understand now. This is like relativity and how huge of a keep forward it was. Science was ready for that, and people and finance aren't ready for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:00:49
I've never wanted to work for a company more than overstock now.  Maybe it's time to pack up and move to Utah?
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:25:28
I'm very nervous about local bitcoins.  What happens if the person scams me or worse attacks me?  I don't even like buying things on craigslist.  Is there a better way than local bitcoins and keep my privacy?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:23:35
I guess I could just buy some wholefood cards from gyft to get me over the next week or eat out a bit more but I just didn't expect to see my money drop by 10+% in value.  I wasn't expecting it to go up a lot but not down.  
You think I should hold?  
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:07:00
Oh. I'm always the optimist. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:25:01

@_date: 2015-01-08 21:54:31
It's because bitcoin is such a leap forward in money and technology.  Think of it like Einstein's relatively or the internet.   They were such leaps forward it took a long time before people really understood how to best harness it.  Give it time, it will get faster as bigger companies (more Microsofts get online)!
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:57:29
This scares me just a bit.  Bitstamp was a large company with people who specialized in keeping bitcoins safe.  It makes me nervous that I can't do it myself.  But I guess you can't make omelettes without breaking eggs.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:06:42
Wow, that's really cool.  Maybe I'll go see if there's something local to me that I can use this at.  Something suggested coin map or something like that.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:15:28
During my lunch break, I might be able to make it. And if I can, my up vote you shall have! 
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:51:04
You weren't kidding about it not being cheap.  I might pass on that for a while.  It seems silly to me to protect $200 with $100 device.

A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says "why the long face?"

Put on your big boy pants.  Did you join this to get rich or to join a revolution? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:23:17
It isn't all about the price. It's about change and freedom. The price is just a nice bonus for people who could see it early. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:13:57
Microsoft and Dell?  For real?  How is this not bigger with a companies like that taking it?

How does the dollar help you?  You can buy all the same stuff using a credit card or paypal.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:27:55
We should worry less about the minimum and morev about when we're going to launch of from it. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:28:03
This is pretty neat. Maybe a wallet my family can use. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:10:10
With the prices so low I'm considering going in all the way!  Fortune favors the brave!
