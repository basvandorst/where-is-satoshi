the libertarian cringe is strong with this one

Interesting, where could read about the performance metrics of lightning network you are referring to? Are you saying it can be faster than CC transactions?
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:24:39
How fast do those mainframes process transactions compared to BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:15:06
Oh no. I **fear** that I might be **missing out**
What if I want USD instead of USDT?

good thing you didnt also try to buy any youtube views from them
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:40:44
we;ve survived for many years without bitcoin

They key is to hodl while getting others to spedn to improve the value/adoption /s
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:23:18
Make that "work for BS internet funbux" and you have have deal!
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:49:35
Well it would be somewhat awkward if none of your writers accepted crypto payments.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:02:00
is HODL your answer to everything?
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:58:35
Since when could you actually buy groceries with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:43:48
So why would the people that currently have wealth agree to this new system? Whats in it for them? If you aint got adoption then bitcoin aint worth anything above 0.

You cant use linear regression for this kind of data. The data points need to be independent.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:14:49
Well if nobody ever spent bitcoin then it would be useless.
@_date: 2018-11-24 05:44:50
Neither.  Its a store of value \\s
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:21:21


Bitcoin has lost around 80% of its value since...one year ago
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:35:45
Hey look at that, coward deleted his comment
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:15:56


are you sure?
What about the fact that he admitted that he would gladly accept payment from the other guy if they had lost? Knowing full well that he had no plans to reciprocate.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:07:57


So then, why even make the bet in the first place? Given your own words(and actions), is it reasonable to expect that either party would pay upon losing?
