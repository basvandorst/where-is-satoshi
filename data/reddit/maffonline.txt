That makes sense, although as a developer I understand why they would choose to use Coinbase anyway: it's just much easier from a technical standpoint. Of course using Coinbase or alike defeats the purpose of cryptocurrencies entirely.

Having the right to do something and being right are two completely different things. You will find no one here saying that Coinbase doesn't have the right to ban people. You will find some saying that it is not right to ban people based on their political views.
You're saying the market will punish them if they're unfair, but are also saying people overreact when they say they're being unfair... Do you see the problem here?

The same, but grammatically correct.

Why are you saying Bitcoin stepped away from the idea of being cash for everyone? Ever heard of the lightning network?
Scaling the blockchain size and scaling the transaction throughput are two different problems. The lightning network solves the latter.
Going back to your idea, relying on only a few nodes to store the transactions of a block is inherently much less secure.

Should we compromise on security to solve a problem that isn't really a problem? I think not.
