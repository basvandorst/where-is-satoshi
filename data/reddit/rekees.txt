You are a unique snowflake, don't let me or anyone else convince you otherwise. You are special. And an idiot.

Bless you, that must be exhausting.

I'm offended you're offended.

What method are you using to buy small amounts daily? I like that idea but most seem a pita for small amounts regularly.

I don't know dick-squat about the specific bitcoin regs sorry but it sounds interesting at least. If anything you'll likely fall under the gambling and money laundering rules if they even apply yet to bitcoin.
My question is how will players level up without PvP? Would the game need to payout bitcoin to those only playing PvE because it seems theres a big problem if you cannot fund enough.

As someone from the UK looking to set aside around £20 a week to trickle purchase Bitcoin, this is something I'm greatly looking forward too.
Does anyone know if this pertains to the yellow PayPoint devices commonly seen in UK shops or something different?

The top comment on the article written by the telegraph brilliantly describes the implications:


Your bank enters into contract with you to act as holder of your wealth, that is, monies or financial instruments that you own and hold via trust in contract with another private party. That relationship is fully defined in the contract, with rights and legally enforceable responsibilities - on both sides. This is common law, in its purest sense, that Magna Carta condenses into two pages of vellum of inalienable rights (which are, amongst others) - the right of freedom of the person from summary arrest and incarceration and the unalloyed title to legally held property.


This 'minor' adjustment to tax collecting powers, if left unchallenged, changes all that. 
Private property, indeed the very concept, principle, practice and legal shroud protecting it - goes. 
Private property then becomes merely a gift and whim of the state. This is a very serious thing indeed and underpins our very ability to exist as independent actors, separate from the state.

Welcome my double decimal digit brother :)
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:15:26
OK...This is... Yeah, well... Ummm... fuck.
@_date: 2014-08-28 11:56:18
Ah ok I can see how that would work thanks. Best of luck to you then! Do you have a mailing list or somewhere I can track development?

I'd argue the short term positive results could hinder the future of the bitcoin. If money can be a measure of influence on voting, I fear long term could see bitcoin fundamentals dictated by the same elite.

I don't think you understand where cloud and VR technology is currently at if you deem them fads. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:16:33
Well if your opinion is based on the fact VR has been around for decades and not gone anywhere I understand. But like there were people who knew a moon landing was scientifically possible in the early 20s, it took technology years to catch up for it to be remotely viable. VR has had its technology moment over the last 5 or so years. In that space of time we've got full positional tracking combined with high resolution screens and optics and it's enabled:
Gaming with presence
A new form of movie/entertainment
Medical/psychological treatment - telepresense surgery, PTSD therapy etc.
Rapid protyping for numerous industrys
Architecture visualisation 
Remote social interactions - telephone to videophone to virtual presence 
And this is not an exhaustive list...
To compare to another industry: Mobile phones had been around for years but then the iPhone1 released and changed the smartphone market forever. Right now VR is having it's first gen iPhone moment.

If it helps before I finish work, my local authority is Swansea City Council. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:12:39
The form in question, page 16.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:25:55
Suppose it's interesting in itself that the form was revised to say that in at least June 2014, possibly earlier. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:52:25
Council tax reduction and housing. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:06:56
No problem, saved me a job in digging out my copy.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:43:50
It's for housing benefit and council tax reduction in Wales. Should be the same form everywhere. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:35:57
For me it's a first to see it on some very official government forms.
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:23:33
Lesson in grammar with the title there, for anyone under the age of 5. 
Edit: Should have said this is applying for benefits in Wales, UK.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:58:43
wales, UK. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:43:42
I have a second blank copy at home, I'll find the exact form id after I finish work.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:44:31
Yes it's for housing benefit and council tax reduction, should be the same one nationwide. I'll check it's id when I get home. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:34:24
At this moment in time yes because life isn't as black and white as you assume mine is. I'm frugal, the £33 per month isn't my entire savings it's what I can safely risk. I'm the sole earner in my relationship because my better half has recently set up her own business but is not yet taken a wage.
To be honest even if I was in dire straits I'd appreciate the feedback that maybe I couldn't afford them but my OP is asking about earning additional ones with my spare time, not asking for advice on re balancing my income.

Exactly this, as pool or individual hashrates go up so does the difficulty in solving. Unless you are very lucky and receive one of the very first ASICs, what will happen is the difficulty will balance the improved hashrates, GPU miners become far less useful to the point of obsoletion and you are now competing your 60GH/s box against other 60/240/OVERR9000!!! GH/s boxes instead of what the vast majority are doing currently, and that's competing GPUs. It's more of an arms race for a larger percentage share of the mining pools than a get-bit-coin-quick method.
One of the butterfly labs staff posted this:
[ButterflyLabs FAQ on ASIC mining rates](
The BTC rates are outdated but the points he make haven't changed.

My very first tip! Thank you good sir, I promise it will be put to good use
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:42:31
Exactly like that thank you but looking at what's there it seems mostly odd jobs and minor requests, whereas I am looking for something with the potential to be more permanant. Great link though and subbed, thanks.

@_date: 2013-04-08 10:34:53
Thank you very kindly, seems a /thread about now would be appropriate!
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:41:23
I'm starting to think it's too soon for the market but still, some good links there, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:25:03
Interesting POV with your last comment, didn't think of it that way.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:39:38
That's how I afforded the 1 this month. Well not my entire savings for the last 3 months but certainly all I can risk right now. I'm looking for ways to bolster this though with something longterm. Given the young age of the Bitcoin though, with retailers only now picking up pace with their support,  it's no surprise ways to earn them seem to not have expanded beyond miniscule amounts for completing offers to reasonable pay from doing odd jobs.

I'm a big fan of what bitspend is doing and hope it continues to grow but I'm not looking to purchase from websites I'm looking to sell items for BTC.

I got the same error generated as others here upon odering, although I did get my email receipt with payment instructions which I've paid. Nice idea with this!

My favourite thing about Bitcoin? Due to it's exponential growth in value upto today alone, we now live in a world where random internet strangers can gift the price of a coffee for what used to be the equivalent of 0.001 USD.
Bugger your kind offer of a coffee though, I'll have me an ale.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:55:30
I'm not following the minute by minute price but a 28% chance we'll hit 250 by May 31st? Possibly although it's more likely 70% chance we'll do it in a fortnight.
