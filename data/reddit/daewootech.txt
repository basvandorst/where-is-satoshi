Make an iOS app and I'm in, the main reason CB is popular is because it's convenient because the app, I can't always access my desktop, but I have 24hr access to my phone.

The whole forum is "I bought $10 @ 19K, the market is crashing, why am I being charged $3 to get it out?" If your losing money right now, you weren't around even a single month ago, hence, calm the eff down.

Why/when would you only send $1?

All the hype train people bailing out and literally paying for it in fees for not hodling 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:13:49
Doesnt coinbase make money on transactions, so if you moved your money from coinbase to another wallet or gemini they profit right? besides people who inject money regulary, the people who dump cash and sit on it would not have moved the money and not generated fees, so by causing disruption they cause movement and get more fees?

This, median home price is just over a million in Santa Clara, [source](  both my parents were basicly high school straight to jobs where as I have a bachelor's and struggle to find anything that doesn't want to pay me less than someone at Costco.

its like housing, people who paid nothing for their house sitting on their porch staring at these kids struggle to pay over a million for a 500 sq ft townhouse

"or .00000000001 BTC lol" still neat though, wonder if it'll be like those kids who find a random bond years later and find out it's worth millions.

well stock to non day traders is a long game with patience and slow methodical moves, digital coins are instant gratification or catastrophe within weeks, days or even hours and they can go on with their lives.

Dang people are super negative.

Called a gift card, but in coin format, lol. Technically they already did this with paper coupon books I believe.
