Can someone give the exact number (of addresses)?

Can you elaborate on the difference between 1 &amp; 2? ~~Which matters more?~~ Does one matter more than the other (for transactions/anything)?

Do you mean if there was uncontrolled supply there'd be LOTS of blocks and no one would really know which block-chain to "trust"? 
Is this controlled supply to ensure trust in the currency?

You're not implying that everyone stopping would work in *your* favour, are you? If so, how?
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:28:31
So there's no way to make a transaction without somebody mining? (just to be sure, since you didn't directly answer and I don't wanna assume things...)

Why are people downvoting genuine questions? Because of it I can't post anymore.
My question is very related (I think), so OP, if you don't mind, can I piggyback?:

would've been a better meme

So in theory, even if someone has even 99% mining share, since it's a *percentage*, wouldn't making a separate mining pool far more bigger in computational power supersede the former one?

How much would it be in.. \&lt;insert future date/era\&gt;

% makes it seem you have some analytical data to back up your claim.

How does it work? Not the mechanics of it, but what do the notes signify? Like, higher notes = sold at higher price?
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:26:47
Yes, that's the code for asking for bitcoins. Now you just wait...
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:08:42
I imagine *other* things might be worrying you even more??!!
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:02:01
..Unless, BTCguild would still keep mining more than everyone else and the situation would be exactly the same... ok I feel dumb.

Thanks, for phrasing better what I meant to say. But why exactly is that? What happens if you lower it? I imagine it only means there'd be plenty more bitcoins than there are now but what effect does it really has? Would it lose its worth compared to dollar? In the long run, why should that even matter?

Everyone wouldn't be rich because ["If we print more money, prices will rise such that we’re no better off than we were before."](
In case of bitcoins, I don't see this as a disadvantage at all because the goal isn't to get rich, it's to distribute mining power among many users.
Coming to dollar, if you gave printing machine to everyone, it'd be essentially the same as the govt printing more money. No one would get rich, but... Apply the same thing with Bitcoin, no one still gets rich, but now we don't have BTCguild hogging up all the minings, right?
