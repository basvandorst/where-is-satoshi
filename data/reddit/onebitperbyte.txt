Look at the link posted above. Make sure you're in BTC and 24hr chart, then look at the color stripes at the top of the graph. There are usually transactions at the very top paying much more than you need to, but those users are willing to pay extra for fast confirmations. These expedited transactions are any colors that only appear in the saw tooth patterns at the top of the graph. The top 3 color lines, under the saw tooth only colors, are your best bet based on your price/speed needs.

He also left out scale. As Andreas says, "don't mistake smooth sailing for skilled sailors." In other words, it's easy to be fast, cheap, and reliable when you process 1/10th of Bitcoin's daily transactions because you've yet to meet the beast whose name is SCALE.

Actually, Segwit was part of Bitcoin Core's codebase before BCash forked it, though it had not yet hit activation signaling requirements. However, upon forking the BCash devs removed it along with RBF, as well as something else I'm forgetting at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:46:00
This is correct. Ledger shows sat/byte as that's what most mempool sites report. However miners mine on sat/(weight unit) so  the transaction is broadcast to the network after the appropriate conversion.

Well, I don't have a lot of knowledge about other currencies with LN implementations
in the works. However, I know Litecoin does, and of course any of the Bitcoin forks after Segwit rolled could utilize open source implementations without too much work. I also remember hearing about a few top-50-by-market-cap-coins working on implementations though I can't recall exactly which ones.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:03:04
Why is it so hard for people to understand that shit coin transaction fees are low because they have super low transaction volume. This means they have low network effect and therefore low usability.
 Bitcoin is ubiquitous and LN will provide cheap transactions. Just because you divided by 10 in this case do you think it's some magical number?! Have some god damned foresight. What if he'd made 100 transactions? Or a 1000? And what if his LN channel was with the exchange/broker he bought his Bitcoin from? Which will be the case for people who only accumulate Bitcoin for usage not investment. Then he'd also reload through that channel and only ever need one on chain transaction....EVER.

Exactly this. Nor does a hub have any say regarding if you continue to share a channel with them or not. Sure, many people will join their community hub, IE r/Bitcoin hub/EFF hub/ACLU hub/ Berkeley hub etc. It'll be a nice way to allow causes you like some modest profits. However, if you part ways ethically, you can just open channel elsewhere. The decision is all yours. There is no centralized CONTROL in LN.

Invariably some BCash shill will attempt to claim that they'll just implement lightning on BCash. However it will be much more difficult to do so without the transaction malleability fix provided by Segwit, as they ripped it out to please Jihan so he could retain his asicboost advantage. 
Couple that with the fact they'll also need to implement wallet software compatible with their non-segwit lightning implementation, and the other fact that their developer resources are far less in number and capability than those on Bitcoin and you'll realize it'll probably never happen

Interesting finally seeing Bitcoin absorbing Alt's functionally.

Not needed but far more difficult to implement without the removal of transaction malleability afforded by Segwit. You've been duped if you think BCash devs will be able to pull it off in timely manner, even if they had the skillz/numbers, which they don't. On top of that all the changes to wallet software it will require to be compatible with their non Segwit implementation. Their copy and paste, shenanigans won't work here. Wake up!!!

Unfortunately, this is just a result of people not making transactions to and from big exchanges on Christmas Eve. Many large exchanges haven't implemented Segwit so it increased the percent of Segwit transaction percentage per block.

It's a way to "program" conditions on top of Bitcoin. A super simple example is forced HODL'ing. For example: if currentDate &lt; someFuteDate then don't allow spending. Bitcoin already has a bit of this ability via a built in feature called "script." But, RSK aims to be Turing complete, read fully capable programming language, and even better is totally compatible with ETH smart contracts so everything already created for that platform will instantly work on this Bitcoin side chain adding further capability and value to Bitcoin. This is a perfect example of Bitcoin absorbing Alt functionality, and why I'm hesitant to diversify into alts.

I send to my ledger Segwit address from gdax all the time with no issues. However, it's P2SH wrapped Segwit address, which is like a temporary standin solution that many wallets use until native bech32 Segwit addresses are more widely supported. Do you know if Trezor implemented bech32 or P2SH wrapped Segwit addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:59
Yes I've done both. Just go into Segwit wallet on nano and generate a receiving address. Then go up to Settings  &gt;&gt; Chains to go back to your legacy chain and send all your legacy BTC to the Segwit address. 
After that go back to Settings &gt;&gt; Chains and choose Segwit (also click remember my decision so you use only Segwit moving forwards)
Then send to any of the places you inquired about
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:18:46
Just to add:
Theoretically possible but very highly unlikely without a consensus change. Trying to stave off COMPLETELY, the ingress of 1MB every 10min, is nearly impossible. There are satellites broadcasting the chain from space all over the world. If even a single person captures that and relays it to the isolated chain it will reorg to the highest proof of work. Radio signals are also blasting the chain across boarders. It's truly unfeasible to assume you can isolate the Chinese Network to this degree without a consensus change. Why even try, they already have BCash.

Pretty sure the authors critique is totally bunk. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but the overwhelming majority of all transactions, Segwit or otherwise, consist of 1-2 inputs and 2 outputs. The 1.6 MB block being highlighted was most likely an exchange using Segwit for few-input-to-many-output transactions to handle users withdrawing funds. These transactions would otherwise be counted as many individual transactions. 
His/her claim of Segwit being inefficient based on # transactions per block does not take this into account.

Riskier to mine Bitcoin as opposed to BCash?!  My response is exactly what your garbage comment deserved. The only reason there was a "lock up", is because the retarded, gameable,  BCash EDA incentivized it to the detriment of both chains. Now that it is fixed, that scenario won't happen. And even if the EDA didn't become an EDAA your conclusion that you would "never" get paid is just more FUD. Yes the backlog was full, but there wasnt a complete and forever stoppage of all BTC transactions forever. You have to wait 100 blocks either way. Lastly, with hash power now destined to land in the ratio of the respective chain values because of the new EDAA, profitability will cycle between +-5% at any given time. So if you mine and sell immediately it's a wash. If you mine and hold BCash, LOL.

In a total economic downturn, if based in the US like the mortgage crisis, will devalue the dollar making it better to be in deflationary Bitcoin. 
However, I assume some non negligible portion of HODL'ers are leveraged and will need the money for bills and will get burned, pushing the price down. 
Best case scenario is that these two forces cancel out and Bitcoin proves itself the store if value we all hope it to be. I just hope 2nd/3rd layer scaling is in place at this time so Bitcoin is fully liquid during this event so as to take ultimate advantage of the publicity

No. 51% attack is simply delayed broadcasting of an already existing truth. On POW chains, hash determines truth. Should you be penalized for someone elses failure to determine how much POW is required to minimize their risk? Of course not. If you're accepting millions of dollars on the block chain you need to be educated enough to determine how much POW(number of blocks) would be required to move your risk to near zero.

@_date: 2018-03-23 15:03:07
You're missing the point though. The address plus the signature is required to spend the transaction. 
Because of that you can't really "find" an address. Any combination of 160 bits could be an address. You can't tell until it's spent because it's the result of a double hash RIPEMD(sha256(PubKey)).
 When the user wants to spend the address from a P2PKH transaction, he/she must include both the public hey that will hash to the address as well as a signature from the private key that encumbered the address.

Try and not get too worked up. I'm anti 2x, but, 2x'ers are well within their rights to their opinions on Bitcoin scaling. And, Bitcoin needs to be able to weather these types of disagreements in order to move forward. 
Worst case scenario is a huge loss of hash power from BTC-&gt;B2X chain along with an empty block attack or 51% attack on the now much less hash-secured BTC chain. 
But this is good! It will begin to define without question what defines BTC and how the tech &amp; community respond in these types of situations. 
I foresee this worse case situation as the most likely one as greed should ensure. Then I believe you will see the true value of HODL'ers on the network. We'll essentially be in a castle siege situation with HODL'ers inside the walls and miners and bad acting exchanges choking off the supply lines to the castle. 
Then, and only then shall we witness the truth. Will HODL'ers panic, relinquishing their hold on the definition of BTC and how it evolves to the will of the miners? Or will miners, starved by their massive energy and overhead metabolisms, be forced to realize and return to their roles as block ordering/pow securing service providers for the network?
Either way Bitcoin will survive. If the HODL'ers win, however, the very concepts that Bitcoin was founded on will be strengthened, regardless of whether it was the correct scaling approach or not.

I understand the sentiment, but it's not necessarily the case if I understand the hackers documentation of the exploit correctly. The entire issue is the use of a non-secure MCU to handle interfacing between the outside world and the secure element.  If the Secure Element did all processing/event handling/etc then any firmware could be checked for a signature before being loaded. Even if a hacker could trick you into attempting to load a hacked firmware, the Secure Element would reject it as the signature wouldn't match the read-only public key burned into the SE. 
His entire argument is that the architecture is flawed in an attempt to utilize a cheap SE, I assume to bring the cost of the devices down.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:30:39


No, I said NOTHING can be considered an attack because nobody owns the network, therefore nobody can lable anything an "attack" including you. It's either an effective use of the network or it isn't, period.


Then 2x effectively used the network within it's defined ruleset to their advantage.And now we know the castle isn't battle proven and we should seek another castle (fork) with the qualities to remedy that particular weakness and you can be almost certain that new chain will be the best investment from an anti-fragility standpoint. 
Honestly though, we should return here to reflect after the fork. You should PM me after the fork has played out one way or another and we can reflect in discussion on what we've observed/learned.

Yes man, please share! I would love to hear how that one goes. I'm literally excited for you and I don't even know you, brother/sister in BTC.

I'm sorry to hear that. 
BTC is just money. Losing it sucks but you can always make more. Even if those lost coins go to millions you shouldn't consider that the limit of your potential earnings. If you really set your mind to it you could create far more wealth.
But I'm not suggesting that. Instead focus on being happy. If earning and investing is part of that then continue, otherwise fuck it. 
As far as your mother goes, again I'm sorry. How you make others feel is the ultimate measure if yourself, and there she failed. Some would say, maybe even yourself, that she didn't really love you because of her decision but I wouldn't be so sure. 
Simply accept the fact that there exists a reality where she loved you but made a poor decision and ran out of time to change it. I've made bad decisions and hurt people I've cared about and then over time came to my senses. Most people have/will. 
Either way, be proud of who you are. Work hard and aim to be better and make the world better. In this way you'll find happiness and be able to eventually forgive your mother. 
Take care friend

Sure, neither you or I like 2x, but it's a completely distributed system and so nothing can be labeled an "attack", but rather a deeper exploration of the parameters defining the system.
And as for losing confidence in Bitcoin, that may happen during the contentious phase of the siege, but only because the castle is not yet battle proven in this exact scenario. Ask yourself this. If BTC wins out over 2x, will you be more or less nervous in the castle next time it is under siege? And wouldn't you rather know the battle history of the castle before selecting it as refuge from imminent future sieges? Of course you would, and so would future joiners of the network. This situation is really all good. We find out now, before further investment, if the castle is worth further investment. Win win.

Dude, please get a ledger nano s and make some metal seed plates to hide at your grandparents house or something.

This is the best outcome imho. Then the entire community learns whether the economic assumption made by Satoshi is correct; that miners will be kept honest in the system by their profits of which the margin is ever shrinking. It more clearly defines miners' roles in the system, which seems to be a point of contention in the community. For the record I believe he was right.

You pay fees for convenience. Take one extra step over to their actual exchange, gdax, and pay no fees, even to transfer out I believe.

You can't be serious about popularity/interest. It's at an all time high. Current demand/price obviously are not, but that's where the "temporary" part of my comment came from.

 You think the world economy in it's current state is ideal? You've definitely missed the entire point of Bitcoin.

I'm following you and you are 100% correct. nSequence was supposed to allow transactions to remain in a fluid state within the mempool until its value was not less than 2^31 which marked the transaction as final and ready to be mined. 
It was a less effective lightning network as it forced the mempool to retain these transactions in flux whereas LN only requires the channel participants to do so until either of them declares it final and broadcasts it to the mempool.
Why anyone would think Satoshi would consider a non-mined transaction to carry any guarantees is beyond me.

No censorship... Sure, but no Truth either. The hate and anger are palpable in virtually every thread. It's self feeding and perpetuating at the expense of true critical analysis and the ability to step back and see what is good for the eco-system as apposed to the ego.
I still read there daily and someday hope for a healing of the community.
Edit: felt guilty for remarking with a quip and felt you deserved a true reason for my opinion

As they dump the price goes down....tempoarily. This strategy becomes less feasible as Bitcoin grows in popularity, because a larger percentage of sold coins are aquired by holders and aren't available to scoop up after prices plunge. As this trend continues it becomes risky to dump as short term profits may be out weighed by long term gains.
