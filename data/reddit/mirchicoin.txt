Coinbase has a lot of traction in the bitcoin community. It has some credible silicon valley backing. I trust coinbase with my bank account details. Online verification is quick.
DO NOT forget 2FA. 2FA is a must.

Flag 1) When did Google jump on the bitcoin bandwagon?
Flag 2) When did Google and Blockchain come together?
Flag 3) The buttons are not-so Google like.
Flag 4) Probably the sender's email id which is not visible in the pic. I hope the scammer is not reading this and perfecting his/ her phishing attack.

I see trust to be the biggest concern while enrolling for this service, as it is with almost all other finance related stuff. I agree it is a great idea and has potential. Can you do a quick YouTube video explaining the service from a end user perspective and from a gateway providers perspective?

2fa is two factor authentication. When you login your coinbase account, you get an option to enable 2fa using app 'Google authenticator' or aap 'authy'. Coinbase generally sends this in an email when an account is created.

Money laundering is a crime whether you do it in USD or INR or Bitcoins. 20-30 crore worth of bitcoin ($5 million) that too from a tier 3 city is a huge amount and quite possible it was being used for illegal stuff. Cryptocoins r good but not when they make doing illegal activities easier. Will not be surprised if the corrupt politicians r the biggest beneficiary of cryptocoins.

I don't think this episode is against bitcoin yet. The officer clearly says that the person will be arrested only if there is money laundering angle to this. I just hope the media doesn't spread it as bitcoin = crime.
