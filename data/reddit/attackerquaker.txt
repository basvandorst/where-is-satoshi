The agents went as far as faking a murder and stealing thousands of dollars. It's hard for me to doubt their ability to type up a fake chat log...

Yes, I do. There is no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he typed anything in the chat logs...

Did you even read what I said? Or are you going to continue responding like an animal with it's head in the sand? A text file can easily be manipulated. Did you see him create the file? I sure didn't. Any witness? I didn't fucking think so. Way to fucking throw away a mans life without evidence.
The hundreds of thousands of dollars that he paid in the hits? You mean the hundreds of thousands he payed but there is not proof of? You know that was sent with bitcoin and no one knows who sent the payment...

I'm not really sure what you are going on about. All I want to know is where is the scientific evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt he created the website and maintained it?

If you show me any scientific forensic evidence I will be happy to believe. It's sad but there is none.

I have read all the evidence they listed. Did they show the jury some secret evidence that I needed to be there for?

Yeah they have smeared his name. Everyone thinks he ordered the hits but there is zero evidence and just lies. I guess it makes people feel better that an innocent man was locked up if they think he tried to murder people.

There are agents here for sure. I would be surprised if there are not agents from multiple countries here.

I get that you believe what they are telling you. I'm sorry. I just don't trust what I am being told about the case.
