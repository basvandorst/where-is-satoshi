How did chargebacks/scams get included in this?  Seems like an easy way to deposit money without jumping through hoops.  Why does everything have to be about scamming?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:35:53
Because it was at $250 2 days ago and all the speculators got taken behind the barn shed.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:47:27
It seems impossible to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:02:27
If I want to mine should I get 7950 or 7970?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:51:23
Too much value vs people that have real jobs and provide value.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:02:18
When is it really gonna crash?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:54
ummm bitstamp is crashed
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:06:18
i guess ill look into this on Monday when banks reopen.  What about using paypal and sending the payment as a personal transaction?  No way to use a credit card and no way to do a chargeback.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:46:08
This stuff is so unstable.  Im waiting for the reddit posts from walmart employees that put life savings into bitcoin at $250
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:55:36
If its suppose to act as a currency and retailers include it as a payment method then yes.  The volatility kills any chance of a retailer accepting this as a form of payment.  As a long-term investment maybe.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:36:34
Pathetic if people are borrowing money they can't afford to lose
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:33:32
Please don't tip me if I win.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:42:06
Is the typical person that mines a bitcoin someone in love with wow dwellimg in parents basement?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:29:44
Sounds like a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:53:47
Look at that 24hr chart and tell me its going back to $266
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:33:00
Shouldn't there be some circuit breakers if price drops fast enough in a short period?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:35:41
Why didnt you just sell the preorder on eBay?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:44:28
How much money did people lose buying bitcoin at $150+
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:57:19
Sounds like something called dollar cost averaging.  It applies in the stock market when you are invested in a company and the stock heads lower.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure what you are invested in when you own Bitcoins.  Something like a casino, ponzi scheme, etc...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:47:44
Nope, into the trash can.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:34:24
Interesting spread between $4 -$280.  Not sure what to make of this.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:52:09
Raise your hand if you have 10k bitcoins still in possession today because you didn't sell when it hit $266?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:39
LOL i know how chargebacks work.  Yall some devious folks on here.  About 80% of general population have no idea what a chargeback is.  What kind of people congregate on reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:02:05
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:36:30
Is it just me or is bitcoin totally unstable losing like 70% of its value in 2 days.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:44:51
This is what happens when you make uninformed decisions.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:21:10
Sorry, bitcoin mining is dead unless you invest thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:46:06
So no way to buy any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:47:25
AKA losing your shirt.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:14:18
Why is bitcoin going straight up?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:36:58
Gameover Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:54:42
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:47:56
So they could make racks on racks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:11
This has ended badly.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:50:26
If you didn't sell at $266 you lost your fortune.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:07:49
Is bitcoin really up from $70 to $120 in a few hours?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:15:56
How much are each one these making?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:34:34
Nah, the game is over.  Quit telling yourself its going back up.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:52:30
yes, sorry to say it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:44
Or lots of new walmart employees.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:14
Huge risks stemming from unstable trading platforms.  Get a more user friendly system and cryptocurrency may take off.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:43:45
Good Night Sweet Gains.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:08:29
Is this real life
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:48:06
Going into trash can.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:44:09
No bank of america account plus they are closed at 7:30pm
