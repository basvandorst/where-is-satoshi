Wow, well that's about the most user-friendly system imaginable.
@_date: 2011-06-15 12:51:33
Post your public key and I will. There's no real reason for my paranoid, but after spending a few days reading up on bitcoin, I feel like being extra secure.

He or she wouldn't be able to sell that volume without moving the market in the process.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:38:30
Well, it wasn't really half a million dollars...it was a bunch of bitcoins. There's no way he could have converted that into anything close to $500,000 USD without taking a huge loss as he sold-off. But you are right about having to be careful with large quantities of currency--but that doesn't obviate the need for a secure bitcoin system on whatever platform one wants to use. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:41:41
Grr, I can't get my log-in to work. Any idea why that might be?
EDIT: Worked in Firefox, but not Chrome.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:42:22
Well, I should have changed the order of those around, because  can't really happen until the market is stabilized a bit. But until prices start being based on bitcoins themselves, then there is really no need to use bitcoins because it's just an extra step in the transaction. Perhaps services would be easier to offer first, rather than goods--if someone is willing to risk their time in anticipation of acquiring bitcoins that they can hold and hope will appreciate in value. Until that starts happening though, bitcoin isn't really functioning as a currency.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:58:20
Nope, the value of them is what they're exchangeable for. The $500k is a "paper" value that has little bearing on what you'd be able to sell those bitcoins for on the market.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:02:24
You're seeing the problem that arises when you try to create a currency out of thin air rather than watching one evolve organically.

You would have to have made a new password in order to recover your account.
@_date: 2011-06-17 01:43:04
You're not investing, you're gambling. No one should have serious money in bitcoin right now, that's just foolhardy.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:13:28
I hate to say I told you so, MTGox, but I told you so.
@_date: 2011-07-08 13:05:00
There are quite a few differences between well established markets and MTGox. For one, the MTGox price swings so wildly that the 0.65% commission is pretty easy to cover. (Not to mention, the OP said he launched this algo right before the crash and had his $3 trades reversed, this means that he's getting a discounted commission price for a while "courtesy" of MTGox.)
@_date: 2011-06-21 07:45:21
Well on the basis of your comment I just read that entire thread, and MagicalTux never said the buy order was placed before the sell order. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 20:45:33
Right now I think people are pegging their bitcoin price to a 5-10 day average of the BTC/USD exchange rate. This way their bitcoin price isn't swinging wildly every time the market moves. Once they take payment, they can either close their bitcoin position immediately to lock in that exchange rate, or hold the bitcoins in anticipation of continued deflation.
@_date: 2011-06-10 18:29:59
No, he's implying that would have to be a moron to transmit your wallet in the clear.
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:29:38
I was logged in while the crash was happening, and I was trying to do the exact same thing as Kevin. In no way do his actions show that he had foreknowledge of the supposed theft. His strongest argument is asking what would happen if 2 or 20 bitcoins had been sold off; would MTGox reverse the trades? 
@_date: 2011-06-16 23:57:21
Also, there seems to be some problem with short selling. I just tried to close two short positions that were showing a positive profit, and both times they ended up being a wash...
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:56:18
As I mentioned in my reply to this thread, short-selling and/or options markets are incredibly important in order to help stabilize bitcoin. Right now there is too much speculation run amok and no way for sane investors to agressively bet against the market when it gets out of whack. Even a prediction market would help, and it could be made more interesting by including other fun things to bet on in addition to bitcoin spot price next week, month, year...
@_date: 2011-04-12 02:22:29
So, one address had 400k bitcoins and transfered them to a bunch of new addresses? I don't see the utility of doing that since the record of tranfer is public. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:55:17
He was asking specifically about a government attack rather than a profit seeking attack. The government would presumably just want to disrupt the functioning of the network by screwing with transactions rather than making money by mining blocks.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:49:03
I'm not sure how to ensure that you would be paid back, but I imagine there is some way to work out a solution if someone is clever enough. I was going to suggest having the borrower put up a credit card number in order to gain the privilege to short-sell, but then I remembered that bitcoins are an unlicensed security.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:52:34
That's just not an option for a lot of people. Most people run windows or mac os and they're not going to change their whole system around for greater security... That's just the way it is. 
The bitcoin client needs to be more secure and require a strong password to encrypt the private keys. Having to enter a password to complete a transaction is a necessity. 
In the long run I think bitcoins are going to need to be mainly transacted between bitcoin banks because at least there will be a way to reverse malicious transactions. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:04:48
Like basically zero--for all intents and purposes, the OP is correct.
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:00:02
It will be interesting to see how the network is going to respond to attempts to block or regulate the currency. I hope the community is working on hardening the software so that it can evade these attempts. I guess a short term solution could be using Tor hidden services, but those are sort of unreliable and difficult for the general public to access. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:34:27
Someone on the  IRC channel was able to transer out 600 BTC before MTGox shutdown. And if one managed, I'm sure others did too. Not to mention, it's totally unacceptable to rollback transactions.
@_date: 2011-07-12 02:20:39
The stamps on the envelop aren't cancelled?
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:34:52
Backing-up the file does nothing to protect you from a malicious attack, it only saves you from hard drive failure. The problem with the current bitcoin software is that you need to have the wallet.dat file, containing all your private keys, unencrypted in order to run the software.
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:05:59
Did your coworker immediately cash-out?
@_date: 2011-06-17 01:32:43
I'm pretty sure it's the MTGox price, but there's a little bit of lag (probably less than 45 seconds)
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:54:30
But in the case of credit cards, banks can reverse the transaction and get some if not all of the money back. 
@_date: 2011-07-08 13:07:49
Haha, why would he want to give us the code? He's trying to make money!
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:04:08
Will do when mybitcoin.com comes back online.
@_date: 2011-06-14 23:09:40
Three things bitcoin desperately needs:
1. Service and products that priced in constant bitcoins (rather than pegged to the dollar)
2. Bitcoin lenders to enable short selling
3. Options markets or prediction markets that enable people to bet on future bitcoin value

Caring about privacy means I must be buying illegal pornography or weapons? I don't understand that attitude at all.
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:48:56
It's kind of a moot point right now since I'm not able to log-in to mybitcoin.com -- I don't know if this is a site-wide issue or only my account but I'm getting a "Down for Maintenance" message when I try. I was asking for your public key just so that I could send you my deposit address privately--I'd rather not plaster it all over the place.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:03:59
I shouldn't be getting *any* information relating to the guts of their backend. It's fine if they're logging the information and then giving me a generic error message. But I'm using the word "fine" loosely. I was trying to cancel an order when this happened and it gives me no information regarding the status of my command. Additionally, how would you feel if you were trying to make a deposit at an ATM and it said "SQL ERROR"? Personally, I would be worried about my bank's ability to maintain the integrity of my data. 
@_date: 2011-04-11 20:30:35
I...don't see what you did there
@_date: 2011-06-16 20:11:10
The interface is really hard to use. I can't tell what time period that chart is for and I have no idea of the prices without scrolling through the pull-down list. I was trying to correlate the charts at bitcoinchart.com with currency tycoon with little success. It's a great idea and I'm going to keep playing with it, but it's still a little rough around the edges.
@_date: 2011-06-14 16:57:11
My experience is in restaurants, but I spend all day looking at CC statements and I've never seen anything below 2% effective and that was a fantastic rate. I'm not sure how you got a rate that low, because that's even less than Interchange which no one can beat unless you're dealing directly with Visa or MasterCard--and an annual volume of $1million does not get you into that club. If ALL you take is debit cards, and you're not being charged any markup over Interchange (not really possible), your effective rate could approach 1% because Interchange on debit is roughly 0.95% + $0.20--but that's highly unlikely for a retailer. If you don't mind sharing, who is your payment processor?
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:16:49
Thanks! I really like the concept and am looking forward to short-selling becoming a possibility on MtGox as well.
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:40:58
Lots of people read the Economist, not just rich old money people. Additionally, *the* thing the Economist is most known for is taking a strong editorial position on everything they report on. You'll notice that the articles don't have bylines, their intent is to speak with a unified voice. So any changes towards more neutral language would be an indication that they are taking a "wait and see" approach to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:59:18


This is the part I was responding to. I don't think the government would be trying to "cash out".
@_date: 2011-06-27 15:06:51
Hmm, makes me wonder how much more improvement there would be if the code were written in C rather than Python
EDIT: Although I assume the Python is being compiled before being run in order to work on a GPU.
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:27:16
I don't know how much data you have there to look at, but I've now attempted to close five short sells that were profitable and it didn't work a single time, so something is going on.
@_date: 2011-06-28 03:59:16
Well, C code would b executing natively on the GPU (as the OpenCL code is). I'm not sure if assembly would be ideal here, as C compilers tend to do some pretty crafty optimization that most humans would probably overlook.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:44:38
Haha, your voice is essentially the internal monologue that was going on in my head while watching Sierra Chart tick away
@_date: 2011-06-14 12:16:05
They want the government to regulate Bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-06-10 18:39:44
I've  never seriously attempted mining because my home computer has a shitty old graphics card. But I messed around with doing it on EC2, and I had the exact same problem with the second GPU
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:09:36
That's not a strategy that will make money. Suppose you have 400,000 BTC that you want to sell and the current market price is $25. In order to have your order filled, you're going to have to accept a much lower price because the volume you need isn't available at the market price. So, you proceed with your sale and the market falls to $10 in response to your sale. Now you've sold your bitcoins for an average price of, let's say, $15. Now you could turn around and try to buy back some shares at the lowered price, but as soon as you start buying in quantity, the market is going to move back up. This isn't a money-making strategy.
@_date: 2011-06-15 04:56:26
I'm not really sure how this happened, but I know that their system should not have let me get to a negative number for my balance. Maybe this was a floating point error? (Although floats shouldn't be used for financial transactions.)
@_date: 2011-06-20 14:26:05
His title is hyperbolic, but I think he makes good points--bitcoin isn't really fulfilling any of the functions of currency right now, and these lapses can only go on for so long before bitcoin completely fails.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:17:28
We'll see if they can make good on that promise. Some people are reporting that they were able to transfer-out hundreds of bitcoins before MTGox shut-down. MTGox will have to reach into their own pockets to make the market whole again. Not to mention, they were streaming trades with out-of-order timestamps during the sell-off; I wonder if this means they were having database integrity problems.
Additionally: What does it mean to trade on an exchange where your trades can be reversed?
@_date: 2011-06-14 13:37:13
Effective credit card rates for merchants are between 2-5% of their monthly volume. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:33:36
I think it's totally unacceptable to reverse completed trades just to "bring stability back". What faith do you have trading on an exchange where your trades are never truly completed? If they follow-through with this, they're going to doom their exchange and cause serious damage to bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:00:33
You mean me not wanting everyone reading this to begin tracking my bitcoins is "not understanding"? I understand well enough, and, like I said, my paranoia is probably uncalled for, but why would I want to scatter more information linking me to my bitcoin addresses than I have to?
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:17:53
I fully agree that the bitcoin protocol/design itself has no security problems, but theses cryptographically secure tokens only have the value they derive from the market, and MTGox *was* the market.
@_date: 2011-06-13 02:31:20
Most sites seem to be pegging the bitcoin price to a conventional currency... Bitcoin isn't stable enough to do otherwise yet. The sudden crash possibility is certainly something for merchants to consider, but unless people start using somewhat sticky pricing, bitcoin will only be used as an intermediary rather than a currency in its own right. 
@_date: 2011-12-11 17:02:52
It's incoherent, but what I think his basic point is correct. You can't make a profit if everyone is using the same algorithm--the margins will almost instantly disappear. This is one of the reasons that true arbitrage opportunities (in non-bitcoin markets) are extremely rare.
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:16:37
I don't do drugs, I'm just thinking through the structure of the system.
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:59:02
I was logged in to MTGox while the crash was happening and I was trying to do the same thing. 
@_date: 2011-04-12 22:43:26
That's a lot but the market isn't liquid enough to really know the value. An attempt to turn them into US dollars would dramatically drive down the exchange rate.
