Doge has a blockchain proper. Lo and behold, altcoins do exist.

Why would a hacker take 25% when he could get 100%? Seems fishy to me.

No. Doge was though.

In the end it doesn't matter what the core developers think. This issue will in the end be resolved by the miners. If they think they will lose money by supporting larger block sizes, they will oppose the increase in block size. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:38:00
Maybe you could post some actual arguments instead of name-dropping?
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:06:44


If there was a centralized miner's union this would be true. In reality there will always be some desperate miners willing to include transactions with fees below the treshold. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:40:03
My argument is that unless the blocks are near-full, there is not going to be any upward price pressure on the transaction fees. 140 times a low number is still a low number.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:36:46


Yes, this is a real possibility. Without a cartel in place this might even be unavoidable in my view. 
My analysis is that if the blocksize is increased the bitcoin network becomes much more vulnerable. The low blocksize is a sort of fail-safe that guarantees that the fees remain at a resonable level. 
Let's assume the we implement the proposed blocksize increase. The miners are heavily invested in mining hardware and will protect their profits. Their ability to act in the best interest of the network is limited because they have invested (often with borrowed money) into mining hardware. If their profit margins are threatened, they will eventually be forced to turn off their mining rigs. Before that though, they will start include every transaction with a fee regardless if it is below any self-imposed threshold, because they want to stay in business as long as possible. This in turn will make the transaction fees plumet, resulting in even less profits for the miners. In this scenario the difficulty will fall rapidly, making the network vulnerable to a 51% attack. This is the endgame scenario I described in my original post. 
The nightmare scenario above is not possible with scarce block size. Because then the miners will have a guaranteed income (transaction fees), determined by a demand vs supply of block space. 


Are you saying that Bitcoin users are willing to pay a premium fee to protect the network? Most users will pay 0 fees if their transactions gets through, the network be damned.

Looks great. A lot better than I would expect for something with that price tag. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:02:16
If bitcoin is hard forked, the miners will be the ones deciding which fork they will follow. If 95% of miners follow the small-block bitchain, then the new large-block bitchain will be unusable because it would be vulnerable to 51% attacks. 
Or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:36:19
This is what they said 5 years ago....
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:26:14


This might work, but it requires centralization well outside the scope of the Bitcoin protocol. There is nothing stopping another mining actor undercutting this scheme for short-time profits. With a free market the transaction fee will approach zero. 
How do you suggest making sure all miners commit to this scheme? Mining licenses? Federal minimal-miner-wage?


Miners don't have any freedom in this sense. They must act according to their own interests as rational actors on the free market.

Remainder that smart phones have been around for shorter time that bitcoin but still have near total adoption.

Probably a bug in some trading bot. These spikes means nothing.

Yey, another alt-coin!

Fact remains that Theymos have done more for the bitcoin community than 98% of the posters of @_date: 2015-04-08 20:26:59
Bitcoin just can't handle the transaction volumes required for mass adaption. When Gavis raises the block size limit, things will be different.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:05:56
Zero fees hmmm. I wonder who's paying the fee...
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:35:43
Not going to happen chump.

This VC money is going to stop soon. And what will happen then to the Bitcoin ecosystem?
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:17:15
Remember that 3600 btc is mined each day mainly by Chinese mining farms. They have fiat expenses to pay so of course they are going to sell a large portion of that.

Bitcoin has been around for a long time and have yet to find a mainstream customer base outside illegal niche markets. Currently, there are no reason to believe this will change in the future.
Let's face it, mass adoption is as far away today as it was in 2011. Tech shops have been burning VC money without finding any sustainable value proposition for Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes older and older the buzz will stop and VC will lose interest. 
I would argue that Bitcoin is in much worse position now than ever.

Are the customers getting refunds?

Chinese miners don't react to news. They sell their coins no matter what. In the past a lot of western miners would hold if they thought a price rally was in the works.

Just a market correction. Bitcoin is still overvalued in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:05:20
Every application they list is rather lackluster


This has been implemented using credit card payments, see for example Flattr. Not to mention ChangeTip. It was also tried during the first dot com bubble. Turns out consumers don't want micropayments.


No reason to rent out space on your laptop for fractions of a cent. Most people don't want to risk getting CP on their devices for unspendable amount of money.


This is probably the best use case on the list. But there is still no reason for having a hardware bitcoin miner on the device. Why don't buy Bitcoin and add it to your account?


Why should anyone use this instead of OpenID? 
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:52:37


This. Actual usage of Bitcoin is nowhere near peak capacity. There is no reason to believe this will change in the short term (1-2 years). The devs should focus to filter out spam instead of raising the block size at this point in my opinion.

How come Girls Gone Bitcoin is still in the side bar? Cam sites are regularly discussed on the front page. In my opinion this is highly unprofessional for a buisness/finance subreddit. Can we please have the link in the side bar removed and the topic banned?
