Not really, if you follow proper anonymity procedures. For instance, take a look at any Bitcoin transaction (I just randomly picked [this one]( Who owns the addresses involved in that transaction? What were those Bitcoins used for? Was that transaction a transfer between two accounts owned by the same person or was it a sale? If it was a sale, was the person buying food, jewelry, illegal drugs, or something else entirely?
At the end of the day, anyone, not just the government, can track the flow of Bitcoins, but they can't track who owns which addresses. This is especially important since anyone can generate an unlimited number of Bitcoin addresses.
See section 10 on page 6 of the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( for more information on how Bitcoin privacy works.

I'm aware and understand that; I just don't see why they would want to.
@_date: 2013-02-04 22:00:27
I'm pretty sure they buy the Bitcoins instantly but don't credit the account until the ACH transaction clears.

$0.0506/kWh?!?! Where I live, it's $0.21/kWh. Yeah, it sucks.

Do you know what money laundering is? If you do, how could it possibly be that?

Why would pool operators discriminate between large and small transactions? It is in their best interests *not* to discriminate. Besides, how would human verification work, anyway?

But then demand would decrease and, in order to continue selling bitcoins, the sellers of bitcoins would need to lower their prices to the point where people will actually buy them. Besides, the sellers would all be in competition with each other anyways, so price would be driven back down to equilibrium that way, too.

Why do you expect it to crash? I've been suspecting a drop to happen soon that would last over the course of a few months (like a balloon slowly deflating), but not a crash.

Ok, it took me a while to think about it, but I think I understand now. It seems to me like it would be inefficient to disguise the source of money using this method, though.

Just because we have a silly system of measurement, it doesn't mean we all like it. I, personally, would *love* to use the metric system, but there's a lot of social inertia to overcome to change that.

One practical thing that I really like about Bitcoin is that if I pay with it, I don't have to trust the merchant with my credit card information, name, address, phone number, etc. just to pay for something.
Now, it is in the best interests of the merchant to not abuse the CC info, but what if their server gets hacked and their customer info database leaked? If you had your CC info saved, now everyone in the world has it.
Additionally, because you're not giving away your name or any identifiable information to the merchant, it becomes difficult to track your purchases. Because you're not giving the merchant a CC number, the banks can't track your spending and sell that information.
Even if Bitcoin wasn't a currency and was only a payment network, I would still use it for that reason alone.

Coinbase also has 2-factor authentication and stores 90% of their Bitcoin keys offline in a safety deposit box.
@_date: 2013-02-07 21:59:36
The short answer is yes. Unfortunately, I can't remember the long answer that includes actual data.

"You can also contact Coinbase support if the problem persists." - This will solve your problem. The people at Coinbase are friendly!

Because that would have been a huge initial investment for him to make for what amounts to an uncertain amount of reward.
Also, selling stuff is fun!

 is also really nice. For $7/mo. I get 2.4 TB of bandwidth, 40 GB of RAID 10 storage, 768 MB of RAM, and crazy fast connection speeds (about 640 Megabits/s down and 100 Megabits/s up, 26 ms ping, all in their Chicago datacenter).

Try contacting their support team. They're still ironing out the bugs in their risk detection system, so these things will occasionally happen as they refine it. Coinbase is still in beta, after all.
There have been a few threads on here about this already and most, if not all of them, have ended happily. Their CEO, is active on this subreddit so there's a good chance he'll see this and respond to you even if you don't do anything.
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:38:05
Ah, I see. I'd suggest waiting for them to respond again tomorrow. If they don't, maybe you could send them another message then. Outside of contacting them, though, there's really nothing you can do. That doesn't mean you should give up hope!

With specific regards to tax avoidance: If your yearly increase in assets is greater than your reported yearly income, you're gonna have a bad time. Oh, and you'll probably get audited ;)

Maybe the place they're getting the chips fabricated doesn't allow pictures inside the facility. BFL is probably not the only client that the fab facility has so they have to keep their other client's intellectual property secret. Alternatively, it could be because the fab place has some special techniques that they don't want other fabrication places to know about.
I'm just speculating, obviously.

But what if you just do a cash deposit to buy Bitcoin and then use the Bitcoin to get cash? You could even put the Bitcoin through a mixer before you get the cash for extra security. Wouldn't this be faster and easier?

That's what I meant--the currency and network would survive, but the encryption used would change.

By voting them out of office; that's how.

But of course, if it's offshore, then it's not readily available. Even if you were able to transfer it to your local bank account instantaneously, you'd only ever be able to spend as much money per year that you claimed to be making or risk getting caught.

Has the faucet run dry? I looked up the address on blockchain.info and it hasn't made any payments for the past few days.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:39:15
Only P2Pool is distributed. All the other ones are run by individuals.

Coinbase can be used without a redirect. By default, it pops up a payment form on the same page as the payment button.
@_date: 2013-02-13 20:26:11
Nope, bank accounts only.
