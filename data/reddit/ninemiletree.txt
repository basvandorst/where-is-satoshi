I'm a BTC newbie, but I don't believe so.  When I go to the GDAX exchange, buying or selling just brings me to the coinbase buy/sell page.  
Coinbase has pretty low fees though at only ~2%

This is fucking insane haha.  I've never witnessed anything like this in my life.  
The rational part of me would say this growth is absolutely unsustainable - but I can only base that on historical models.  The fact of the matter is BTC and cryptocurrency are inherently unlike anything that existed before, so it's a fallacy to say with 100% certainty that this is an unsustainable bubble that must burst. 
I read an article *yesterday* about someone predicting hitting $14k in 2018.  
It hit it later *that day*. 
Just madness.  What a wild ride either way.  I only have a small amount invested, but this is about as close to feeling like riding a roller coaster as I have felt sitting in an armchair.

GDAX *is* coinbase AFAIK

This is how I think of it.  Put $200 - $500 in, instead of going to the movies that week or buying a videogame or other entertainment purchases that month.  Behave more frugally, and invest in something that has the very real and tangible potential to 10x that investment.
If it crashes, I've only used money I would have never recouped anyway.  
And if it does crash, I still hold the currency anyway, and I have faith in the technology and the rebound, so I still have the btc and if it's cheap enough, I might consider putting 10% of a retirement account towards it and waiting for the upswing.
