You had them insured though right?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:55:45
Then you have work to do if you want those beanie babies to be worth the investment.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:17:23
Thank for the reassuring news OP.  I was about to sell but now I think I will take my family out for a nice dinner.

You are asking the wrong person.  I can only see that they are down 90 million if they want to honour the price at the time of the shutdown.  I highly doubt they can cover 90 mill.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:02:34


You mean the ones that are worth [$500,000]( now?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:18:11
Has been trending up yeah but now trending down due to unforeseen circumstances.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:13:50


I laughed. They are down 90 million bro.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:57:50
You haven't lost anything unless you sell.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:33:35
I mean you are trying to assert you know what will happen in the future.  How can you say categorically you know what something will be worth in the future?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:37:11
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:00:17
Oh only 120 coins?  That is not so bad.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:57:00
Hmmm if they are really shifting that much coin then I suppose it might be possible?  But I doubt it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:40:25
Eh until they sell for a loss then they havent lost?
Their "currency" might have devalued and maybe they will eventually sell at a loss but until they actually sell then they haven't lost.  Maybe in the future the value of the beanie babies will increase and they can sell at a profit.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:47:53
Good thing you are working on those kids then.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:20:23
Buy High Sell Low!
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:05:26
Hah maybe maybe, to be honest I am not committed enough to this argument to dig into the historical selling price of beanie babies.  Also I suspect they've been selling longer than since May.
That said if your argument really hinges on the fact that beanie babies didn't appreciate as well as expected then I'm not too worried.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:02:47
You could not have predicted the hack.  The initial decline was due to the miner meeting.
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:47:03
More cheap coins!
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:04:36
Cool, 3 million, but that is unlikely to happen any time soon.  So lets look at some near term scenarios.
1% of M2 money supply = $28,500 per Bitcoin
5% of M2 money supply = $142,800 per Bitcoin
10% of M2 Money supply = $285,700 per Bitcoin
I rounded a tiny bit but you get the idea.  Just 1% of M2 money supply would be enormous for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:39:11
Uhhhhhhh if you mined those coins when they were worth &lt;100$ how could you possibly think you did the right thing when gold value has increased what? 10%?
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:26:36
I imagine a lot of the Chinese involved knew this was coming.  It probably wasnt a surprise.
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:35:24
Oh my bad I meant to reply to the guy you replied to.
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:39:49


Why assuming Satoshi's coins are gone?
Fair point though.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:58:37


Oh come on really?  They think something different therefore they are evil?
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:24:29
I mean I don't quite understand how you read my comment and come out with the conclusion I'm saying the blockchain is the only takeaway but ok.
Bitcoin is a thing.  A big thing.  But as I say lets not pretend it isn't owned in majority by the billionaires who run the banks.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:45:20
Miss the Intersango days.
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:23:13
Depends how many coins you have really.

I think it is.  Any reason for 3M+?
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:02:34
For now.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:52:01
Bitcoins dead you should sell everything.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:58:47


No.  No it isn't.  It is a cryptocurrency.  Maybe it started out as an idea but it is now something a whole lot more.
Lets not pretend that the vast majority of bitcoins aren't held by the 1%, the billionaires around the world.
Really the blockchain is the idea here.  **That** has some serious potential to change the world.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:48:32
I suspect we will see 800-900 soon.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:30:33
This is a good way to get people to scour your post history to fuck your shit up.  Be careful.

Because this isnt a sudden drop.  Market has been bearish for 24 hours now.  Also just watching the order books.  Enormous buy walls are getting eaten up like its nothing.
Hopefully we meet resistance at 1k again and spring back quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:49:03
This is why people say don't invest more than you can afford to lose and diversify.
Purely on gut feeling I reckon around 1060 will we see a turn.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:49:01
Invest the money directly into buying bitcoin.  Cloud mining is a scam.
You will get a much much better return on investment by just buying and holding bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:35:11
It is going to be declined.  Nothing will have changed between wink etf and this one.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:43:38
People like this are probably from I wouldnt worry too much about Bitcoin long term.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:17:40
Segwit is sadly unlikely to happen.  BTU controls too much hash power and they are politically opposed to it.
It would be like trying to persuade T_D to vote for Hillary.
It has been a very very clever campaign by a few bad actors to slow or stop Bitcoins development.
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:25:06
I dunno.  Bitcoins strength is that it doesn't need people to protect it.
BU is arguably what an attack might look like and so far it isnt working.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:37:35
Isnt that just a log graph?
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:02:22
Many people think those bitcoins are lost.  
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:08:06
Right but how long until 4M? 
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:34:09
Hmm I dunno man.  Money is power always.  If there is money in it then the law will change around it.

Hahaha get rekt.  Long way till the bottom yet friend.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:07:00
I am a simple person so can you explain it to me.
Chinese banks give low interest loans which the borrowers then use to buy bitcoins, going long?  When the loan is due they will sell the bitcoins and the market price will tank?
Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:15:14
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:44:55
You deserve gold.
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:09:37
Because that is where they were making money?
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:51:25
You have an interesting perspective.
If bitcoin is just another transfer of wealth, which I'm not sure anyone is denying, what exactly is the problem?
Bitcoin was never supposed to solve inequality right?  It was just supposed to be a truely digital currency.  The benefits of bitcoin as a system of payment (once it is all worked out anyway) are mutually exclusive to any sort of equality balancing aspects right?
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:30:32
Surely the obvious reason for not having 1 mill bitcoins is that it would put the market cap at 16 quadrillion? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:07:50

Chinese government appears to be cracking down on bitcoin.

You have been making the same posts for 2 years. lol.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:54:33


I don't understand this.  Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  Surely the problem is that people dont have enough wealth, regardless of what format the money is in?


How is this any different to current system though?  The people with the most wealth are usually the ones whose families have been rich for a long time.  Usually by owning land or large companies.  Also what exactly is the belief system here?  And can you explain what you mean by libertarian ideologies?  I hear that phrase thrown around a lot but dont really understand what people mean.
Also it sounds like you more have a problem with capitalism than anything else?  That wealth can be focused on a few at the expense of the many.
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:46:52
Urm actually you can.  Maybe not exactly what form it will take but it is quite easy to predict roughly where technology will be at any given point.
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:45:43
I dont think he comes back. Seen him(op) post this kind of post often. And never answers to criticism.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:23:50
Aight thanks.  You posted twice btw.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:46:41
Again it really doesnt matter.  Aside from that you cant pretend we live in some ideological world.  There are people who will only be in for the short term.  Let them.  Who cares.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  
@_date: 2016-12-31 15:50:40

Haha indeed.  Personally I wont be excited until I see the price double for a couple of years running.  Lets see where we are next year heh.

@_date: 2016-12-28 22:43:27
Does it matter if he pumps the price lol?  The people who know the real potential of bitcoin dont give a fuck about small timers like this.
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:28:03
