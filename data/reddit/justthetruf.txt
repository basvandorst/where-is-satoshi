Why you so mad lil buddy?  You posted the same thing someone else posted hours ago and then a few other ppl before you the same thing.  
I never even asked a question.  I just think you're rude to people that were actually interested in your topic and you still choose to ignore them.  
It's a weird behaviour.

Lil buddy you literally just posted this and you have ppl literally questioning your post you created.
Quit being a fucking weirdo, if you're going to take time to start a conversation at least have the decency to engage in it.

Coinbase itself fucking sucks to buy bitcoin, I haven't tried gdax yet.
Coinbase has a built in dashboard showing market value but as soon as you go to buy they inflate the buy price for an invisible tax.  So instead of fucking being open and clear you have to assume it's always going to be higher than the dashboard.
That's not including the clear tax that's stated.
If gdax doesn't alleviate it I will be switching and shitting on any coinbase post I see from here on out because how scummy it feels.
I've got no problem paying an additional tax but be upfront.

Honestly kinda pissed about this, onlyh put money in to buy something had to wait for funds to clear and before I can purchase shit starts to tank.  Awesome.

New to the scene, using coinbase what are tools people are using to set buys and sells at certain points?

If it does it won't be much lower than that, don't believe me look a year back and check every 3 months were at the end of the 3 month cycle So it should be going down at this time but if you follow the 3 month pattern it's about to go back up 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:03:46
Looks like a pattern dip every 3 months

Why do so many posters here link to articles on different websites?  It feels like a trend.
I click the thread thinking I will get an interesting read but I'm left to click again.
NO THANKS.

Looking at the trends seems like it's headlining near 3700 and if you look back a month was the same trend, if you go back a year it's a continuous pattern.
Don't think you're going to see 3k
