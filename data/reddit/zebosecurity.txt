Yeah you turned out to be right on the money... cough.

If the coins were in true cold storage, then malleability issues wouldn't be an issue, this raises pretty large questions around the MtGox security protocols, or lack of.

Well pardon me for not accepting your breaking news version of events.. kindly provide some proof, or kindly fuck off.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:45:32
Yeah or stop bullshitting.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:15:48
Yep bang on. Nice reasoning. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:56:44
Full of shit is all I can say. Proven by the events since your last "breaking news" story asshole

Well, he pretty much admitted it in a tweet a few minutes ago.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:41:59
Let me just throw this out there for thought.
TwobitIdiot is the same person who authored the initial document regarding a critical situation at mt gox, he leaked his own doc.
Twobitidiot has banking connections with JP Morgan etc, and numerous others.
As a security expert, I smell a pretty big rat here. The fluctuations in BTC are enough to make anybody a lot of money 400-600-400. 
Two bit idiot is taking you all for idiots.

That's it, I'm out. 150 coins bye bye. Thanks for the laughs.

Why should they have to to make payment in btc feasible? 
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:09:42
A lesser of two evils situation? Hardly sustainable.

I guess the question would be is it worth the headache for me as a business to go to the hassle of offering btc implementation that is far from streamlined, in order to cater to 200k in the world that happen to own btc.. or do I stick with the status quo and accept that higher % cost per transaction. It's simply not worth my time convincing a customer to buy btc in order to spend btc with the aim of saving a few % in transaction fees.
I'm not anti bitcoin, I've been dealing with it for years. My main concern of late is why would your average consumer bother.

I just mean that it doesn't limit attack vectors to tls
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:49:17
Well I know what I'm doing today. Not sure this is the best way to test a tls implementation but oh well :)
