No mean to throw a wet blanket over. :)
If you located in US/Canada/UK or most part of EU.
A $million is nothing after taxes.
My advice is: don't commit a sinful mistakes I did, sold all my 80% to a hedge fund  that willing to cut a big cheque without even blink their eyes months ago. Fortunately, those money directly diverted into new startup company, so taxes is minimal.
What I am try saying is, be patient a little until hardfork completion and bare in mind, there will be a messy acquisitions by wall street due to derivatives branch for speculations. More Bitcoin' related hedge funds emerge, more investible instrument creation by wall street to hold Bitcoin and related cryptos, Futures &amp; Options hedging etc.
Just my personal opinion. 
Here's what I will do, cash out a tiny portion that enough for basic needed.  Resume daily life in the pass without Bitcoin. Observe market regularly.
There may be terrible volatility in between. Hey, since you already have, assume, gone through those volatility should be hard to face another few in between.

That IRS part I don't have to worry. Accountant already help handle by the book including unrealize gain. The deal completed few months back when BTC still at $2K area through private negotiated listing and all necessary legal closing n paper process transfer clear a few weeks ago. 
Surprise me is still reading news about 1st Bitcoin for house news couple weeks back while there are few if not dozens of Bitcoins for houses last few yr.
Except, one thing I didn't know, there is a complicated process to get your fund back into Fiat in one lump sum at once.

Great idea that I never thought of before. Thank man.

For the safety, I prefer cash out 75% into fiat to new investment that require cash injection.

What is OTC in crypto term? Is that the same as equity 'On the Counter' transactions?

Shouldn't be a problem with legit transaction records from lawyer and accounting firm. Beside, those funds  will transfer to newly form company account anyway. If one Bank don't like the source, always other bank will take it. Cash is cash as long as legit, unlike President Trump laundry his money for Russian gulags.

Nah! Whoever joke on this knowing that is impossible. Chinese kids learn both from their math class since jr yr.

Should be in BTC blockchain. Not hard to find for a few hundreds BTC at once twice.

Remind me not long ago, we all know Trump is a horrible person and a con-man. However, many of us still secretly voted for him, else he wouldn't be 45th President of United States. ( If you didn't vote, you consider for whoever the winner also consider voted for him )

Very true. No govt can stop the rise of crypto, at least for now. However, Govt could collapse crypto worth by illegitimate the use like cocaine or heroine. Constant raid the mining operation and exchange and charge those who possess any crypto. Like drugs, always people willing to risk but most will try avoid the troubles. At the meantime, Govt could introduce it own version of national crypto. If succeeded, Btc or other altcoin will vanish on it own.
By the way, I heard my China Inland friends said that China will start to raid as many mining operation in the next few weeks.

IMHO. Short term trade is always risky. Not because the underlying instrument worth but rather too emotional plus stress may eventually cause unrealize substantial lost. Consider BTC only with 21mil supply plus dot zeros (8 of them). Entire population that can afford it multifold increase. Even total 0.1 percentage increase in user with existing 5% by estimation, the price will eventually worth $10k minimum in next 12 months. I think your so call monster will be your proud next summer.

Not sure Dimon realise the Fiat also a grant fraud, worst it back by IOU debts. The Bank under his watch also a major crook committed countless of financial frauds. So what's make him? A major crook? Why people always take a crook so serious? As if they don't have enough from Trump?

After reading, I further Google the possible cause on China crack down ICO. I think possible afraid of similar ponzi pyramic scheme for fellow citizens being the victims as it happened in Eastern Europe yr ago.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:56:56
Not quite. China atbthat time was a feudal corrupted nation with internal conflicts while outsiders, mostly Europeans with not simply trade but with colonizatuon mentality wherever they go. At present, China ban cryptos is not they really roll backward but another Chinese clone on it way like Alibaba etc.

Sometime, not about the potential ceiling it will be but rather when is enough is enough. I'm happy with the return so far and keep a few for future as retirement bonus. 
A lesson learned: most exchanges will take whatever among fiat you deposit, but withdrawal is always a limit.

I know coinbase can handle small sum 10k or under. They are unreliable because they have no registered financial consultant meet face to face to make sure securely transact without hiccup. I heard of some bad thing from them that's why I try look for something like JP Morgan...Thx anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:50:30
Appreciate for the info. I'll try this route. Found out most US exchanges couldn't really handle large sum at once due to banking policies related to cryptos. 
P/S:  didn't realize cashing out is far difficult than expected. I heard that in China or in Japan way simpler.

I sold 80% holding to a hedge fund firm. They covered all transaction costs at today noon market price. I think pretty good deal without the hassle.
