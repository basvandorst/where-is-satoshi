Maybe have your parents sign up at Coinbase then use your debit card to buy BTC.  The limit might be around $500.  Once you have some in the on line wallet, you can send it to an off line wallet where you parents/Coinbase can't get to it anymore.  You'll get dinged with fees purchasing it, and then sending it, so watch out for that.
Definitely don't lie.  There are banks and taxes involved and they will verify you using an ID at some point anyway.
It might be a fun thing to get one of your parents into along with you- my dad loves stocks so I gave him some Bitcoin and he is all about following it around even though he only has like $100. Good luck!

NiceHash should bounce around to different algorithms.  You can check your progress [here]( (enter your btc address) and compare your rates with the NiceHash Calculator [here](  The dollars/day rates on the NiceHash miner software are averages and take time to settle in, too, so just running it for a few minutes at a time will probably return low or high rates.
The black screen sounds bad.  Maybe your overclock settings are off?
Also, r/NiceHash have better information.  You can find all the settings you need there- just search gtx 1070, it's very popular.

Unless you aren't paying for power, a [watt-meter]( is a good idea.  Once I hooked my 1080s to one I noticed that undervolting my cards I saved so much in electricity that I actually earn more in net profit than pushing my overclocks.
I am at 60% power limit, +240 core, -300 mem on my cards.  They sit at about 60 degrees and you should see only about 150-160w at the wall one one card, depending on your rig.

If you have a gaming PC you can fire up [NiceHash]( on it.  Get an off line address from something like [Bitaddress](  Input that address into NiceHash and click go, and eventually they will pay you in BTC.  You can have it mine when your PC is idle, and might get $1-2 USD/day.  No age limit on that!

$5-6/day, $150-180/mo, $1800-$2000/year is pretty good from one card, I'd say.  It's all free to you if you mine when your not using the computer.  In all likelihood the BTC they pay you in will go up in value too, so you can buy another card and make even more in a few months :)

* Go [here(Wallet Generator dot net)]( and click the link at the very bottom middle to download the git repository zip file
* Now find a computer without internet but with a web browser.  I boot an [Ubuntu LiveCD]( because it doesn't have persistent storage.  Just boot and kill the networking.
* Extract the zip and open the index.html in the extracted zip.  It will look like the page you clicked in the original link, only now it's run from a file on the computer and not online
* Pick you coin on the right (Bitcoin)
* Wiggle your mouse until it generates a code
* Print that wallet to paper or file.   One the printer might store jobs, so take precautions!
* Send any funds you want to your new wallet PUBLIC address
Now, you have to encrypt, print, or otherwise store that wallet somewhere.  If you lose it your Bitcoins are destroyed.  You can print multiples, but protect your wallets like they were $1000 bills.  I use Veracrypt to encrypt my wallets and store on USBs in my fire safe and encrypt and store in my cloud.
You can make lots of different wallets from that generator, which is cool.  Litecoin, Dash... etc.
