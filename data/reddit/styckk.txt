I think they assembled it the wrong way. The steering wheel is on the wrong side. You're never gonna be able to sell it like this.

what's wrong with hiding scores? upvote quality posts, downvote shit posts. shouldn't matter what score something has to be able to decide. 
edit: other subreddits handle those trolls and other unwanted comments by hiding the score for a limited time, and after that show the score as usual. would that be a solution maybe? (just in case it's different on this subreddit currently)

Am I too late to the "hi, it's me, your brother" party? 
Anyways, if true and accessible, congrats and fuck you! :p

here's a thing that just came to my mind (bare with me, if this is very noob-ish to ask): he says that you can't create bitcoin at zero cost. 
now if bitcoin was the only currency world wide all of a sudden, what would happen to mining? electricity would cost bitcoin to create bitcoin, but to my knowledge you need a very good currency/kWh (or mining power/kWh) ratio to make profit. how would that work if bitcoin was the only currency?
