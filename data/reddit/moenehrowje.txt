"Roger  Ver, do you or any of your owned or controlled interest hold equity in  Coinbase, stock options in Coinbase or any other vested or unvested  right to any kind of ownership interest in or profit sharing with  Coinbase?
The Bitcoin Cash community  deserves an answer here. For you to support Coinbase and profit from its  operation in light of their acquiring of Hacking Team (a cybermercenary company that sold surveillance tools to the world's most vicious  autocrats and dictators) is disgusting to say the least. Please give the  Bitcoin Cash community and the world an answer because any prior  attempt was received with silence from you, Roger Ver.
