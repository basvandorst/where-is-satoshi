It can be both.
Those who live their lives outside of the USD can and do speculate on USD moves,  as well as trade with USD.
For folks in the US, who are paid in USD, save in USD, spend in USD, USD speculation doesn't make sense,  because your salary and prices are rise/fall at the rate of your investment.  (i.e. It's like asking a fish about water)

A direct assault on Bitcoin isn't likely to succeed in my opinion.  That will just make folks dig in their heels and draw attention to bitcoin.
If the US government wants to kill bitcoin, they will do they way they kill anything - with money.
Given that fiat money is unlimited to the CIA/NSA,  all that would be required would be massive buycoin buys which drives the price skyhigh,  then massive bitcoin sells that slams it to the ground.
Do that over and over about a dozen times,  then leave it laying on the ground (after a massive sell) and there will be some many bodies and broke people, that bitcoin would be forever discredited as an unstable idea.
This only entity that could do this, would be one with unlimited ability to print fiat.

That's the problem.
If the global currency were bitcoins,  the US *COULDN'T* fund terrorist with bitcoins.
It's only possibly now because of the ability to print money.

Nobody ever accused AOL of "not being real"
They said it was to expensive.
Then they said you couldn't get nothing but a busy signal.
I WAS there and online before AOL.
