You don't have to care. Looks like this is for developers. You may one day use a multisig wallet that isn't branded as Coinbase at all, but is based on this API. In my book, that's pretty awesome.

Isn't it just easier to use the "request" feature and send it to your own email? Then you just tap buttons instead of copy/paste. Since it sounds like you already have an account the request would just bring you to a payment page I think where you can complete the request.

As far as I've ascertained most of reddit dislikes Coinbase because they see them as the bigger well-funded player in the space and everybody loves rooting for the underdogs instead.

@_date: 2014-11-17 10:07:59
Seems like a cool feature, but also probably hard for them to justify development time for given the relatively small number of people who would use it and opportunity cost of missing out on other things they could develop.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:28:49
Sounds like ripple.
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:29:52
Sounds like a good idea. But a user could just make 2 accounts - 1 merchant and 1 regular user. Then they could buy their own products and then "rebuy" the bitcoin at 0%. Effectively, this would be a way to simply buy all their bitcoin at 0% in the first place, circumventing Coinbase's typical pricing structure.
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:09:20
Yeah, sux. I wouldn't blame the company though. This is regulation that they have to abide by, there is really nothing they can do about it. The 2% is a little high compared to coinbase &amp; others, but it's not really a deal breaker. The GST is the part that kills.

We all know that. But the mystery of Satoshi is just like any other mystery in life: it's fun to think about.
If he covered his tracks well enough (and it seems like he did) then it doesn't even matter how hard we try anyway. And the community's efforts to discover him do not oblige him to any extra work or protection than the steps he took when he was working on bitcoin. You can't retroactively become more anonymous anyway. What's done is done. Whether we try to discover him or not, his course of action is unaffected.
Meanwhile, people will be people, and there will always be someone searching.

I hate to be that guy, but when will Charlie Shrem stop being a thing in the bitcoin world? He started a site years ago that was cool for a little bit, then sucked, then he was arrested because he was willingly and intentionally encouraging suspicious activity instead of reporting it (among other things). That is literally his claim to fame.
Seriously, do people who even name drop Charlie Shrem know why he is known? He is like the Kim Kardashian of bitcoin. He is famous because he is famous, and nobody knows why.
He didn't contribute to the protocol. He didn't start dark wallet, or open bazaar, or create coinjoin, coinpunk, or anything else that actually contributed to bitcoin in a meaningful way. He didn't start a cloud wallet where you hold the keys like blockchain.info, or a long-term vision, solid business where people can buy bitcoin reliably (the point of his site) like Coinbase. He helped sketchy people and got arrested for it. At least DPR was making the world safer by taking drugs off the streets. Charlie's claim to fame is genuinely making the worst decisions possible.
There are heroes in the bitcion space. Shrem isn't one of them.

I completely agree.
On top of this, the argument that "these companies are motivated by their own profits" is kind of FUD. I'm sure they are, to a point. But most of the people I've met in the bitcoin industry running these kinds of sites are intelligent, passionate people who got into it because they believed in the idea. Most money chasers I know have kind of laughed off bitcoin, preferring instead to pursue boring spots with high salaries at investment companies, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:37:40
I get your frustration, but in all honesty, what are you going to do with a bitcoin address in the app? I mean, on a computer at least it's easy to copy and paste and put into an email, but doing that on mobile just seems cumbersome. What is the real use case? Everytime I've been using bitcoin on mobile it's to either send someone money, which is covered, or have them send me money, for which I'm not going to go find an address in the app, copy it, move to my email app, paste it, and then send. I'd just use the QR code.

In my experience setting up a Coinbase account has been equivalent or easier than setting up a blockchain.info. For both, you basically specify your login credentials and then verify your email. It's basically the standard signup process all around for these sites.

I actually agree with this article and think it makes a good point. This is it exactly:


But as voiced by the other comments here, Coindesk's reputation is starting to hurt them. For anyone to take their good stuff seriously, they have to stop the hyperbolic and inaccurate stories, and stop removing comments that correct them when they're wrong (like children). Otherwise people are just going to assume that everything they put out is equally shitty.

I'm not sure if you're trolling or not so I will give you the benefit of the doubt:
Coinbase doesn't require you to have a Coinbase account to use their checkout pages. You just pay with bitcoin like anywhere else. It's just as easy and as open.
But *in addition to that*, if you are signed in, you can just click to pay. So for me, a Coinbase user, that is a better experience.

It's kind of like asian countries cloning US tech. The first time you explain that xiaomi has released a phone that looks *exactly* like an iphone, and that they're basically design thieves, the natural reaction is "no, a company could not do that!" Then you look at the thing, and there it is plain as day. And then you look at that industry, and see it all around. And then you look at their [F 22 Raptor clone]( and see that this isn't just in phones, [dishonesty]( is rampant in everything they do because they are outside the purview of our laws. In chinese culture it isn't even considered dishonesty, just pragmatism.
So yes, I do believe most of those numbers are faked. You make it sound like a big deal, but it's really just a few guys at computers trying to sound better than the other guy to attract more customers. It's not like it takes 50 years of practice and a huge evil motivator. They just want profits and it's easy, and there's no reason not to.

It's really like asking "is everyone switching from blockchain.info to coinbase?" These bitcoin wallet sites are commodities because there are no traditional network affects that lock you in. (In fact, one of the philosophical points of bitcoin is to be free from lock-in.)
If there is Blockchain.info + Coinbase, people don't move from one to the other, they just have accounts on both. Now people will probably have accounts on all 3, and when the next fancy thing comes out they'll have accounts on all 4. Because Circle users can interface with Coinbase users can interface with Bitstamp users &amp; Celery &amp; Blockchain &amp; GoCoin etc... ad infinitum. There is no real concept of "switching" in this context, only making more baskets for your eggs to be kept in.
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:25:27
It was $9.95 on Coinbase, you may have missed that.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:46:09
It's quite dangerous that this message is reaching front-page, because it's wrong.
The problem wasn't due to the nature of blockchain.info being web-based, it was due to a fault in the key generation mechanism. This same thing could fail in a bad software release of any kind of wallet that generates private keys - including desktop or mobile programs.
So by blaming it on "web wallets" you're missing the actual danger, and making yourself more vulnerable to falling prey to it in the future.
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:31:58
Exactly. I've just seen a lot of posts recently claiming definitively that Circle is always cheaper with screenshots like this, that I decided to check myself. Like 5 of them have gotten to the front page, too, so I thought I'd introduce a little objectivity.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:13:56
Your list is nice but it would not have prevented the issue...
1. The problem was not somebody having your credentials - it was that you were tricked by the phisher. You willingly entered your creds, 2fa is just part of your creds so this wouldn't have helped here.
2. That option is already available in your [security settings](
3. The OAuth page is actually hosted by coinbase so the urls and certs are all legit.
The real solution is what adrianmacneil suggested, which would be to manually approve apps, or at least ones that want to withdraw from your account. Having "OAuth disabled by default for all users" would unnecessarily kill developers. If they can make it safe without doing that - which they can, by manually approving things - they should do that instead.
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:45:07
These chinese companies do not have to abide by any regulation that would incur them penalties if the numbers were not real, like US companies would.
Edit: The bitcoin community also doesn't have nearly as much representation from asian countries as it does from english-speaking countries. It doesn't make sense that they would be trading so much more than us and not also have a very active community around it. Theirs should be more active than this subreddit and bitcointalk combined, at a minimum. But it's nowhere to be found.
@_date: 2014-09-19 04:19:53

1) Coinbase gives credit for instant buys.
2) You cannot purchase bitcoin with a credit card on Coinbase.
3) Even if you could, the possession of credit card information does not mean you're the owner of that credit card. That stuff gets stolen all the time.
Your corner store does not issue credit, so that is not a valid comparison. This is why you are wrong.
Further, bitcoin has a lot of "purposes," one of which is privacy/anonymity, but that does not mean it has to be *completely* anonymous, *all* the time to be valuable. If Coinbase is simply a gateway to the old payments world, where your ID is required (it isn't, by the way - it's optional), and you can then move your bitcoin out into a completely anonymous world (which you can), well that's something I'm pretty thankful for.
Take a step back and take a deep breath. I mean this more educationally than offensively, but you sound like a nut.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:12:06
where Visa &amp; Mastercard are defended as bastions of privacy, and the equivalents in the bitcoin world are derided as evil privacy violators.
No, Visa &amp; Mastercard definitely do not check your credit out of good will to save merchants the trouble. If you don't pay your credit card bill, it's not the merchant who loses out - it's the credit card company. Do you really think they'd still be willing to issue credit to strangers without credit checks, if it were impossible for merchants to get charged back, but still possible to not pay your bill? That is one of the most absurd things I've ever heard. They do it to save themselves, because they could not survive as a business otherwise. Coinbase is doing the same thing.

It doesn't make any sense. If you are going to buy BTC and spend it at the same time, you may as well just pay directly with the payment method you were using to buy the bitcoin.
Bitcoin is about efficiency and you're asking why they don't provide something entirely convoluted.

The Streisand effect is going to bite her, yeah. But I think she came across as a reasonable, well-meaning person, just lacking technical insight.
The real embarrassment was the interviewer. When you suspect somebody doesn't understand something, you try to help them answer in a way that makes sense, not pounce on them just to prove they don't know what they're talking about. (Unless you disagree with them *in principle* on something, not just *on technicality*, which is completely different.)
When I got to that point in the interview where he's like "so why would you use a blockchain for that" I kindof cringed out. That's not how you conduct an interview with someone who's trying to help you and the things you believe in. Like what is the point.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:08:08
The only reason you hear so much shit about Coinbase is because they voiced disappointment in the state of bitcoin development, and support for ethereum. It has nothing to do with their service, this subreddit has a vendetta to fulfill.

No, I am right, and I have the [screenshots to prove it](
[Circle buy]( (more expensive, **2.5% more** than Coinbase's 1%)
[Coinbase buy]( (cheaper)
[Circle sell]( (you get less, **4.24% less** than Coinbase's -1%)
[Coinbase sell]( (you get more)
I used a quantity of 100 bitcoin to exaggerate the differences. These screenshots were taken within seconds of each other without price fluctuation.
*Even though Circle quotes a higher spot rate, you get a worse sell price at volume.*
Circle is simply more expensive in both directions. You lose as a consumer by using them.
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:21:11
If it were true that most people bought or sold this way, there would be no incentive for them to rig the rates at higher volumes. The fact that it does skew so far is IMO evidence that many users do higher volumes. In other words they manipulate their payout curves to favor small numbers for comparison's sake, when most users probably fall into higher tiers.
But we have no evidence how many people do what volumes so at this point I'm not sure we have anywhere to go.

This is really wrong. I'm not sure you understand how Coinbase works. The user paid in bitcoin. On the receiving side of the transaction, the merchant decided to exchange that bitcoin for dollars. That doesn't mean there wasn't a bitcoin transaction.
Further, their checkout pages accept payment from regular wallets too - not just Coinbase. So I'm not really sure what you're going off about.


If this were true, the value of your Coinbase balance would fluctuate every day because it would really be a USD balance. This doesn't happen because in reality you really do have access to bitcoin. You can even generate new public addresses, and people can send into your Coinbase wallet from a regular client.
So in summary nothing about what you said makes any sense, and you are wrong on all counts.

It's a derogatory term invented by Bitcoin trolls to frame the longest Ethereum chain as illegitimate, by placing it at equal status with the chain that it was forked from.
You better believe that if Bitcoin got forked one day and Core was the winning side, they would not willingly start referring to themselves as "btcf".

Both forks contain the "original" chain, and are extensions of it.

It does not "appear" that way. There isn't and was never any evidence for that, just rampant flamebaiting by common trolls. They've also already posted about making a feature for withdrawing pre-fork ETC. That you still pretend to hold this perspective is further evidence of unchecked bias in this forum.

I think sometimes just coming off as sincere has a big impact. Sometimes it's the tone of the testimony that matters more than the content. Prosecutors use this same tactic to make defendants look guilty; they need to use it themselves to come off innocent. Doing it convincingly could have a big effect.

Those posts have definitely happened. They also don't seem to have quite the same number of users.

Not really. Users with pre-fork ETH on their services will be able to withdraw ETC. Seems pretty straightforward.

Your post was on a rational track until you inserted "premined shitcoins" and revealed your bias.
