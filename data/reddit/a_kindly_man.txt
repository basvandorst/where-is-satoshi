I think its best to view it as two different layers. The "infinite" layer that you're describing here is the actual underlying technology. Its the ability to create a secure, distributed ledger.
On top of that "infinite" layer, is the finite layer, which is bitcoin, litecoin, whatevercoin, etc. The finite aspect comes from the usability of each different coin. Bitcoin is a finite supply, and to gain access to bitcoin's uses you need to use bitcoin, you can't use another coin. This includes the markets where bitcoin is valued, and is able to be used as a medium for exchange. I could create a fork of bitcoin which has the same access to that underlying "infinite" layer, but the finite layer where bitcoin exists is lost to me, and anyone who would like to use my forked coin.
If that makes sense. :P

The solution is a layer on top that let's buyers pay with their preferred coin, and sellers receive their preferred coin.

If you buy every dip, you will eventually buy *the* dip!

Because that 50% drop followed a completely unsustainable period of growth. It was large, and scary, but not unexpected. You can't just isolate the drop from its relevant circumstances.

1 good boi = 1 good boy = 1 good doge = 1 doge = 1 doge
Seems to check out.

My coins are up 20% over the last 24 hours, that's pretty good. It took a couple of weeks for everything to drop to where it was, we're not going to recover that all in one day, but we gotta start somewhere.
Its also coinciding with pretty good discussions coming out of the US Government, and other Governments across the world, which suggests the rise is from growing market confidence rather than a momentary pump.

That's not really why doge is a smart investment. The community around the coin is unique in it's resiliency because they don't let greed drive their activity. And the tech of the coin itself has several stabilizing features that haven't been adopted by other crypto projects. This is why despite almost every other thing on the market going through these wild swings, 1 doge has continued to be worth 1 doge.

You can buy whatever legal thing you wan't using your money.
You can't buy whatever legal thing you wan't *using someone else's money*. That's what a credit card is. You're borrowing the bank's (or whoever's) money with the agreement that you will pay it back at a later time. If the bank doesn't want to lend you money to buy certain items, they don't have to.

Hatchet and Glock.
In 1,000 years we're either post-scarcity or back in the Stone age. If we're post-scarcity or back in the Stone age, the other three are useless. At least in the Stone age the hatchet and Glock would give me some survival tools.
You could *maybe* justify the iPhone just as a store of knowledge, as long as you got to prepare it before being transported. Though you better find a pen and paper quick because chances are you won't be able to charge it.

That's certainly a benefit, but I think it a side-effect of bitcoin, not the purpose. The purpose was to create a secure and decentralized monetary system that wasn't influenced by legislatures and could distance itself from global financial malpractice. It sought to increase economic freedom by removing the need of a third party (banks) to verify and secure transactions between individuals.
Being able to buy banned things can be great, but that isn't the most important aspect of bitcoin.
