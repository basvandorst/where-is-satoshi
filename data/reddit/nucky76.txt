At this point in bitcoin’s life I do not think a crashing market would be helpful. Do you think a trader who needs to answer a margin call will HODLing. Do you think the thousands or even millions who lost jobs will be HODLing?

Install a new wallet. Drop the wallet.dat in c:\%username%\applications\roaming\bitcoin (if windows)
let in sync and try like hell to  remember your password. If you are on a private network you’re probably ok. You have to expose it to the network to sync.

Chasing Profit no but creating and selling derivatives that even they didn’t understand, knowingly selling CDOs while not being able to back CDOs, rating agencies rating based on business interest and not content or policy, building instruments without regulation that reward predatory lending practices.  I would say there is plenty of blame to go around for fucking up our economy, banks are not immune.

Not a dumb question just one that everyone wants to know.
Probably a dip but I thought that at 12 yesterday so I don’t know shit.

Yes, because politely asking questions on Reddit makes you mindless sheep susceptible to all of life’s dangers.

“Who do you think supplies terrorists with money in weapons?”
Well it’s not Janet Yellen. I just think the scope of blame is a bit broad for such a complex situation. That reminds me of people blaming drug users for funding terrorism or chocolate lovers for exploitation in Africa.
I am not a fan of our banking system and in no way an apologist but I don’t like manipulation even when I support the agenda.

Yea that shit was at 14 for like 30 seconds you lucky bastard.

How long did it take you?

$10 alone won’t grow into much but make recurring small investments, like you would with a 401k it will hopefully be a nice egg in 10 years. 
Sounds like your doing it right. Just invest what you can afford. Put a Little alway for savings and watch it compound.

Yes, the middle class will receive tax cuts but again it will be temporary. Why not make them permanent like they did with the corporate tax cuts? Partly, because making them permanent would show the true cost of the legislation. I do believe that corporate taxes should have been cut but more like 28% instead of 20%. In the 80’s Reagan made massive cuts early in his administration and then spent the next 6 years raising taxes because of his increased spending. Personally I would have rather seen an infrastructure bill rather than any tax cut. Now since we have added almost 2 trillion to deficit it’s going to harder to justify a spending bill like infrastructure.

I guess it depends on your definition of the “establishment”. I would say the establishment is the minority that has control over the majority. If the establishment he is referring to is comprised of corporations, banks, and ultra-rich with overwhelming access and influence over our political system, then yes he is very much part of the establishment. 
Hey may not be a part of the “republican establishment” but his overall agenda is still focused around the needs of the global establishment.

That’s great. I have a couple of hives too. Unfortunately most of the locals don’t know what bitcoin is. I guess I could just sell it online.

Hodling is good but we truly need more people making legit purchases. Cheers to you my friend.

Wow, good for you. I probably couldn’t get dogecoin from escorting. Just curious how long have you accepted bitcoin and what is the preferred rate in that business?

What were the fees like?

Sold 1.6 litecoin at 320. Was going to by BCH and GDAX rejected so went back and litecoin dropped like a brick. Tried to buy in at 280ish GDAX crashing so was able to get back in at 291. Made .2 litecoin. Fucking Gordon Gecko over here.
Most of my BTC is on lockdown so I can’t really fuck with it. It’s a good thing because I have done some dumb shit trying to day trade.

I built a python script that pushes out that hack for every Casio watch in my network. I am mining 2 coins a week on that. PM me for code.

Yea, started out interesting but turned into some tin hat bullshit. Haha Janet Yellin is a “Terrorist”. I mean calm the fuck down. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:42:02
It’s temporary for individuals. Corporations received a permanent tax cut. That’s the “scam” argument. That the cuts are not aimed toward the middle class.

GaaawdDaaaaamn! people sure  pay a lot for sex. Probably not that much to a high roller though. Maybe I can talk my wife into taking bitcoin from me instead of bribing her with foot massages. ��
Well congratulations on your success.

Anything human hands touch has the capacity for corruption. This includes government, corporations, your local church, capitalism, and socialism. They can also bring about some good things if people look for honest and  effective execution of goals. Bitcoin has the capability of changing economies for the better but don’t think it can’t be corrupted by something besides government regulation.

Most investors invest small amounts periodically. Invest $50 per week or per month and you may have a nice egg by next year.

Dang I just checked mine from four years ago and have a confirmed reward of .00991 which is like $100. They don’t pay out until I get to .01 . It would take a while to mine even .00009 in today’s standards.

Do you still purchase on Coinbase?

Well up until the last four items on the list each one required significant investment. I mean $1000 for a computer vs. free Pokémon go app? Interesting graphic but Not a good comparison.
