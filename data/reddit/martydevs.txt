@_date: 2019-04-11 15:49:38
ahhh, that's fucked up, what even if the receiver is completely innocent and just received it from someone, could carry the burden of getting his bitcoins being seized? kek. what do they do with this seized bitcoin, do exchanges do it now? like binance? do they seized bitcoins from MT. GOX for example or the Silkroad
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:22:05
isnt bitcoin fungible? 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin right?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:00:58
yeah that's my thoughts as well, at some point if DEX's will come to life and be more easy to use this wont be a problem anymore.
@_date: 2019-04-13 00:24:15
It can bs track easily on the blockchain you can get all the transactions that a UTXO have been through until its coinbase state.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:16:20
I think a lot of people doesn't even know what TA really is. TA is not about predicting the next freaking price movement. It's about finding patterns and signals that shows the **highest probability outcome is.** Looking at other's TA is fine, but depending on it with you trades, and moaning, getting angry with them because you lose some good trades, that's not fine, like you're a total idiot. You should have your own freaking strategy, that is why it's called Technical Analysis, ANALYSIS! it doesn't guarantee what's gonna happen in the future.also imo **HODL** is also a lame kind of behaivour, set stop losses wtf.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:16:41
Jeez what bug? Making me wanna rethink,  my cold wallet is segwit im getting paranoid now
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:27:26
we are all CEOs here :P
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:13:25
Whats the refixes of you addresses?
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:33:44
Yeah I know, but they should still consider specially the ones who are not informed about the benefits of segwait
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:26:47
Custodial defeats the purpose or the main selling point of btc... Rt... :/  is it really necesarry to run a LN full node to participate on lightning without custody?  Like anyone can join bitcoin network without running a full node with wallets like electrum but still having full control of their bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:32:48
Yeah,  I use electrum.
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:54:32
why is it only 13 minuts?
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:25:49
yeah its the legacy one, electrum does have a segwit but u need to create a new wallet
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:27:30
Thats a great idea!  I havent thought of that.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:45:55
it kinda does matter, segwit tx are smaller, if we all use segwit we can free up some space for more tx on one block....... every byte count since the bitcoin is stuck on 1mb. pretty lame tbh not even 2mb atleast :/...
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:25:08
Yeap just recently
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:40:21
that's my plan as well not focus on price. But right now its kind of a bit hard as well to promote specially about the fee part lol.. but for what it can do its still pretty amazing. gotta scale it tho
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:32:22
Quite Selfish,  segwit is beneficial for you and the whole network. When you use segwit tx size is much smaller lik 30% meaning you free up space for mlre transactions.. And the more people using segwit the more it helps all of us.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:43:14
is that it? I did all the instructions, nothing happened.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:47:23
See before we call it "cheap decentralized cencorship resistant p2p system" now its just cencorship resistant payments?.... It was like banking the unbank, poor people specially from emerging countries would benefit from using btc.....  But it isnt the same way as now...  Im not against LN but why cant freaking have both??  While we wait for LN we slowly increase blocksize to solve this scaling issue..... this slows adoption...
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:33:51
they already have one
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:02:12
I know right its better now compared before which is great! , but still its still quite high for micro txs. Im just amazed bout Nano how fast txs there, they even have a speed tester live... I hope LN could go mainstream sooner than later, Go btc, i have high hopes.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:42:06
But how about the alleged cencorship of r/bitcoin about bigger blocks back then, and blockstream being owned by some bank who promotes credit cards
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:29:39
when v1.0?
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:43:31
Clue: Electrum Wallet
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:07:05
the incentive to mine will be the sole protection of the network, If they stop mining they risk losing security of bitcoin, which also a lot of people holds, and will hold, even there's no block reward, there's still an incentive. But yeah, try bitcoin cash it has cheap fees &amp; fast if you want real usable p2p e-cash. For now bitcoin got more focused on being store of value side, instead of the real vision.
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:17:42
You didnt got the memo?  lol its beneficial for you as well
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:57:40
you can use any wallet that supports segwit, search for one you want. One I currently using is electrum allows you to create wrapped segwit (3...) and native segwit (bc1...)
