Yes, something they completely ignore here for obvious reasons.

The druggies here don't like reality. Fact is he is charged with hiring a hitman. They don't like this fact so they downvote anyone who mentions this. 
In the meantime they keep repeating the lie that it was dropped and upvote the fuck out of it. 
Then they accuse the government of propaganda. 
I wouldn't believe this kind of behavior if i didn't see it here with my own eyes. It's completely crazy.

I assume you think he didn't run Silk Road? I mean innocent until proven guilty right?
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:12:49
Likely? Can you back up this claim or did you just pull this out of your ass simply because you don't like it?

I've been reading about it. Why you act like it's some kind if secret where it comes from? It was made by the FBI. They even admitted it.

Lets post yesterday's news all over again.

Damn, that are some shitty domains.

This place is filled with broke teens who hold very small amount of coins that they think will make them rich, drug users, conspiracy theorists and other outcasts. I didn't expect anything else really. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:01:40
You people just cherry pick parts to be true based on what you like. I don't see anyone here denying he ran Silk Road. Because he is your hero for doing that.
The way the druggies here think:
Ross ran an online drug market: True! Because i use drugs myself and i consider this awesome.
Ross hired a hitman to have people killed: False! Because i don't like to hear that.

It would be nice if you kids could stop making up sensationalist titles. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:51:04
Yeah, they grow the cocaine and mdma at home. 
And no, 1 layer was added. Nothing else changed. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:26:31
How did he stop that many murders exactly? Where do you think his vendors get the drugs from? There was simply 1 group of people added in a long chain of drugs changing hands. How did this stop 100's of murders?

We know. It was posted 50 times last week.

Please back up your claim.

May i suggest reading the rules to your right. 
They were made for people like you. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:36:41
Because someone in a Youtube video he found on David Icke's forum said so. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:11:39
Yeah, and that is still happening. Where do you think these vendors get their drugs? The supermarket?
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:42:08
We know. Because it's yesterday's news. The reposts on the day itself are already bad enough. Just stop it please. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:51:38
Please just stop being such a fool. It's been explained 20 times by now. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:36:44
The media made this up? What?
Please back up your claim. 
Edit: i see you quickly edited your post. And still look stupid. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 00:39:22
You truly are one of the biggest idiots who posts here. 
Your iq must be so scary low. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:11:37
How do you know?
Please don't tell me you just pulled that out of your ass. It would make you look so pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:37:11
The only downvoters i see here are Bitcoiners who downvote the fuck out of anything even slightly critical. Basically the only thing you are allowed to say here is Bitcoin will be worth 10k by next month. Anything else gets downvoted to hell. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:02:47
They weren't dropped entirely. Stop lying. It's sick how this gets repeated in every other reply in every Ulbricht thread. 
The propaganda the druggies here spread is worse than i've ever seen on any site.

How old are you? Please don't tell me you're older than 16.
