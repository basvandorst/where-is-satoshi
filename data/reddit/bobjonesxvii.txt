Whatever you say.   But Bitcoin just forked to avoid segwit and Core weren't even known pedos.  Government will be a piece of cake.

I don't think it's very wise, factoring 'politeness on the internet' into your investment algorithm, using the sample size of a post on Reddit.  
And the whole "I was informed yet pristine and undecided yesterday, when all of a sudden..." narrative does sort of raise my antennae. 
Anyone who is new here, I recommend when investing you evaluate facts not feelings and definitely not how polite people are on the internet.

change 'solving cryptographic equations' to the 'flex arm hang'

I just read your thread in Bunch of folks answered then, one guy said something indirectly challenging to you.  On reddit.  And above is your manipulo-narrative.  Bro.  Just, stop.
AFAICS what really happened is... after a feverish conflict, wherein the truth was ignored, false narratives spread, and piece of shit liars revealed, this OP tells everyone all over again to compromise and kumbaya.
- ignorant of the fact that a fork is made by not compromising
- bullshit "i was wearing a halo when bch attacked me" sob story is transparent
Verdict: more forks please

Visa took over half a century to scale to this level.  
During that time they did not have to kill Mastercard.  
I don't see why ye official layer 2 solution (tm) must be locked in immediately and at any cost.
If you let Bitcoin perform, all that's needed is time and openness.

At least you guys are entertaining.  When someone repeats segwit enough it reminds me of Pacman.  Segwit segwit segwit.  Segwit segwit segwit segwit segwit.   OMG, suddenly, segwit tastes great.  Now, I'm turning on CNN to learn about racism and global warming.  Thanks guys.

Thanks for update. 
Same here, after about 10 days of account being frozen and unable to perform any action, finally was able to transfer BTC out yesterday.

Hey this is great!!

I started getting this error 6 days ago. Attempts to contact Camp BX have gone unanswered. Thinking at this point the bitcoin is probably gone.
