What does that mean long term for Bitcoin? Is it essentially lost and unable to fulfill its promise of being a decentralized uncontrollable currency?

Jack Barker, you son of a bitch!

Can Bitcoin be susceptible to this same problem? Can Bitmain (or another entity) successfully centralize it?
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:43:53
But even that makes it sound more legitimate than our shitcoin reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

not racist, but definitely moronic. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:11:05
Yes, but I'm asking if an entity like Bitmain could control enough of the BTC mining infrastructure to effectively control the currency itself?

State run healthcare is shit for a lot of the same reasons state run money is. Didn't think I'd have to explain that here.

Honestly this. It’s literally how nature works and the reason humans have evolved into what we are now.

Yeah all property rights being defended by an organization funded via violent extortion is totally the same as people defending their own property.

That... doesn’t refute what I said. 
You have a right to not be raped even if someone rapes you. It doesn’t mean the rapist doesn’t know it’s wrong or make it not wrong. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:19:10
You don’t see the difference?

Property changes hands through voluntary mutual exchanges. Everyone understands this. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:59:13
4 years and you needed convincing to do that?
