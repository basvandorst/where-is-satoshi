Ever heard of the Boston Bombing?

Makes sense, but when the Bitcoin "basket" is full of gaping holes like Ver claims there are, why put your eggs in it?

Andreas could destroy Ver if he truly wanted by simply bringing up the real details of his felony.
Bcashers will tell you he was only arrested for some "firecrackers." The truth is Ver was in possession of an extremely illegal firework due to it's excessive amount of explosive powder (approx. 15x the amount of the average firework). They were practically small dynamite. 
Couple this with the 50lbs he stored in a residential building and Ver was in possession and distributed fireworks with enough explosive powder to make 20+ "Boston Bombing" bombs (which used approx 3lbs of explosive powder).
Ver is a legitimate sociopath who risked the lives of others to make a quick buck on eBay.

When people who don't know anything about Bitcoin travel to the .com domain because of not knowing any better, they're ultimately being manipulated. r/btc posted Web traffic analysis of bitcoin.com vs .org and the BCH site had more visitors. Is that because all these people are interested in Bcash? No. But because your average person uses .com for everything else in their life and assume that is where they would get started with Bitcoin. It's blatant conning.
