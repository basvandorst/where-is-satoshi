It happened with gold, silver and oil! All the prices of those have dropped in the past and their ETFs got removed or declined!!! /s

Imagine how many threads there would be if someone posted every time there was a 2% move. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:12:30
What it is that they do there? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:05:05
Just a scenario, i just wanted to know if people can bypass tax by saying they lost their coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:42:49
Why 16 and not 15
@_date: 2017-02-18 05:13:00
I hope this doesnt catch on, coinbase closed my account recently. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:03:11
Its a real bitcoin exchange, just one that doesnt use fiat.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:06:14
I promise you the price is going to the upper hundreds by tonight 8pm
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:21:01
His name was Harambe.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:38:00
Localbitcoins for cash. Dont sell through coinbase or you will get account closed like me.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:21:16
No, you cant trade the price of two different commodities with one etf ticker.
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:51:58
What if someone honestly really did lose the bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:52:50
0% fee, volume means nothing.
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:30:13
You know those wallets with thousands of bitcoin that have only moved once or twice? Rothschild wallets in hibernation. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:08:33
I own a website that i pay for that does nothing at all besides show a picture of my friends face as a joke. Having a website doesnt raise approval of anything. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:18:10
Do they add more shares to gold etf if gold gets all sold? No. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:04:41
What do you do?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:32:33
Your friend dropped 200k on bitcoin last year? Mine dropped 2mil bruh.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:15:19
Would you rather have them spend their bitcoins on hookers and blow? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:28:07
It's not scando if it's open source and available to everyone. If you see them doing something unethical with the code and don't want to use it, guess what? You have the option not to. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:26:41
I would like a source too, i keep reading comments similar to yours but if would be beneficial to get the info from a valid source too. Where did you get that info from, another commentor? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:42:21
If you know how to do something on the cheap and make  $$ on it wouldn't you be doing it already ? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:25:54
Where's the Brewery at? Hope it's in socal
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:01:11
That's the difference in buying 10,000 for 9 million instead of 12 million. Lmao I can't even right now.  
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:43:42
Maybe if the SEC approved them to be on a regulated exchange they wouldn't be on unregulated exchanges anymore. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:51:53
Dudes probably loaded.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:30:06
Won't buy anymore currently and I probably own more than you, we can prove so by signing. Bye felicia.    
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:55:42
He meant the mining power. there's literally a video of them showing some miners using the power generated from a waterfall as a source of clean cheap energy. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:55:03
No it doesnt. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:45:14
What you bolded was written on the 22nd, 48 hours after that is the 24th. That was 1 week ago, if they connected and traded Loaded would have confirmed by now. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 06:17:52
Saturday 11:59pm, SEC dont take weekends off. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:32:56
Prob not
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:42:10
Look, all i need is a reliable source from the sec or exchange, i get the feeling that youre just echoing stuff you have read in other comments. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:38:09
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:22:32
I hope that happens so i can scoop up 30-50,000 single digit bitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-04 05:56:15
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:12:31
Just say you lost your private key, then how will they tax you?
@_date: 2016-09-12 02:06:18
@_date: 2016-09-24 19:16:32
Yes they are locked, they work like a few other gold and silver etf, do you understand how they work or what an etf is?
@_date: 2016-09-15 13:21:53
Fuck yeah San Diego!!!
