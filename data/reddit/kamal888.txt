Hi all,
after few days of inactivity I've finally implemented the reward-based sorting function. So now you can sort faucets based on their rewards!
Note: Works only on "All faucets" section.
Please, keep in mind that the page is still in pre-alpha, so the reward-based sorting may not be 100% accurate...

Today update:
- Just add support for some more faucets, currently 702 faucets supported
- Some faucets probably won't be ever supported by refresh script, because they require a captcha to open the web page and some of them just don't allow access from script

Another update - added button "Refresh" to each faucet, so you refresh data for given faucet. Most of "N/A" faucets are not supported by script yet, but you can try anyway :)

Webpage was moved to new hosting because of limited functionality of the old one... New URL:
I've added note and redirection to the old hosting address.
Code has been updated, new faucets added. The page is now directly connected to faucetbox, so when new faucet is listed there, the page automatically tries to pull info from it. It also updates positions of faucets automatically, so when some faucet moves up or down, it should be reflected on the FaucetBox Extended.
I will continue in work tomorrow, stay tuned :)
