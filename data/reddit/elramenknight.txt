Not sure, man. I believe Trezor accepts Bitcoin. I know for a fact having used a Ledger Nano S for a while that Bitcoin addresses aren't reused.  
Outside going to another country and having it shipped to some hole in a wall? I'm not much of an expert on anonymity.
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:29:35
What do you mean by not doing good? What's the latest news?
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:16:30
Congrats and welcome to the club. I'd say just work on slowly accumulating more along the way. That's my plan.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:54:47
I read elsewhere in another subreddit that they haven't been maintaining/updating for it as much lately?
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:55:02
Both Ledger and Trezor are running 30% sales.  
That being said, I do still keep a small amount of Bitcoin on a couple of exchanges for scalping purposes. It's never usually about 1-2% of my entire holdings.
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:48:57
Is $100,000 Bitcoin for your own selfish get-rich quick scheme the goal here? Or is it likely that we should just be more supportive of developers who're working toward making updates such as Schnorr signatures, Taproot, and Lightning Network a reality?

Resubmitted actual link at mod's request.
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:01:27
Figured I'd get this in ahead of all the inevitable referral link spam. Still debating whether to get a second X to split my holdings up or wait for Trezor to also make an announcement.
@_date: 2019-11-30 07:18:42
Steady and strong hands, folks. That's what it's going to take to ride this through before we see some serious gains.

Margin trading isn't investing.

It was just an excuse for him to post his Bitcoin address and hope people send him pity party donations.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:31:37
Now that Ledger and Trezor are running 30% off sales, let the Ledger vs Trezor debates begin!
@_date: 2019-11-30 20:45:15


"But here's my Bitcoin address if you want to donate."  
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:55:57
Bull af.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:40:47
Trezor accidentally mailed me 2 Model T's instead of just 1. Just months until the halvening. I'm reading this as a good omen. Time to accumulate more!
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:43:50
Crypto people on the internet almost overnight suddenly flipped bullish. I bought my usual weekly/biweekly amount a couple days ago. What changed?
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:10:53


What's your question exactly? Bitcoin has been battle-tested whether its community of supporters liked it or not. If it's truly not fit to be a store of value first and later a means of transacting via Lightning Network, so be it. Tis the nature of the beast that is technology.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:57:11
That's only if we get more buying interest. I don't park my coins at unregulated exchanges anyway, would be surprised if any of them felt the effects of this materially.
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:56:27
Not too often you see someone on reddit recommending pirating a book and donating to the author another way.

With Proof of Keys coming up, I'd look into withdrawing days ahead of time. I wouldn't count out Binance having sudden mysteriously long periods of "maintenance."
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:45:18
If you're in America, I'd recommend Binance.US. Lowest fees among the bunch atm.

Holy hell Bitcoin transfers are fast today. Last one was done within a couple of minutes.
@_date: 2019-12-30 03:44:11
I'd dollar cost average in slowly.  
Beyond that, you know the usual. Keep 6-12 months of emergency savings around, pay off CC debt first, etc etc. The usual stuff you hear at @_date: 2019-12-16 23:23:57
3 straight days of none sold just means we've got room to be pummeled. Not a lot of comfort there I'm afraid!
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:02:51
Segwit alone won't be enough to help with scaling, but if just a handful of the top exchanges by volume do this as well, it'll make a world of a difference when things take off.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:54:26
He's mocking the typical altcoins shilled there.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:35:12
One of these days, imma have to find one and hit it up with a small buy just to mark it off my bucket list.  
Is there a reliable way to find one? Is KYC required or can I just buy with straight cash and have it sent to an address?
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:31:45
Seems to me consolidation periods are when things get a tad boring. But it's a good opportunity to buy ahead of future price spikes.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:59:36
Go all in on Bch then. No one's stopping you. The Segwit2x debate ended with the big blockers being proven wrong then when the community shot them, again when it turned out Segwit2x's code had a fatal bug, and now with LN taking off.  
You're on the wrong side of history, bud.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:52:24
Looks like it's struggling to hold $7.3k
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:50:43
Bruh, I was also on the Ether hypetrain, but their continued insistence on pushing the difficulty bomb--why TF was this even necessary?!--and refusal to reduce the issuance rate has me a bit concerned.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:17:13
I do think it will take off. $100,000? Who knows? But equities and bonds are becoming a no-go for many.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:42:13
Correct: 
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:27:09
Fuck going back to fiat. And as I've always told those shitting on BCH, let nature take its course. We won the so-called war with the big blockers already with Segwit2x. BCH is just their last stand. Let them take their last dying gasp.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:43:41
Probably be a while before we're fully out of the woods. I'll admit I was slightly worried, but I do think low $6k territory at worst was/is the bottom.  
Slow day at work, probably going to hit up the charts and troll crypto Twitter as usual
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:00:27
You know that BCash's promises of being oh-so-cheaper-and-faster are a sham when it still takes a good hour or more for transfers to go through. Haven't experienced similar issues with Bitcoin ever since Segwit adoption and transaction batching became a thing.
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:03:00
That's the thing though. Coinbase already has been implementing transaction batching. I'm hearing that further improvements down the road can be made to Segwit to ease transaction traffic even more. LN will probably make the biggest difference over time though.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:26:56


By one estimate, 25,000 BTC was sold off. There's still another 20,000 left.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:25:08


I'd expect a retracement from this quick of a recovery soon.
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:57:54
Buying secondhand I guess?
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:28:35
If you want to play the contrarian tactic, then the fact that every damn TA wizard is calling $5-6.5k bottom means you have to consider that the opposite will happen, that this IS the bottom.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:51:11
$7k finally broke.  
Get your dry powder ready, folks. I don't think this "mini-bear" is going to end for at least another couple months. As long as those [PlusToken scam dipsticks keep selling BTC]( we might be waiting a while before we see strong $7k support let alone $8k.
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:37:36
Tapped into my dip fund, nearing the target BTC amount I wanted to obtain before the end of 2019. I wouldn't know if this is the bottom, but it's still down from the more recent high of $14k, so it's a buy for me.
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:02:17
Aside from a pitiful amount in alts I'm leaving on one exchange, I'm not putting any coins "back." Already did my scheduled buy and transfers to my wallet earlier today, so it's more or less business as usual for me.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:44:16
Why does POS keep getting delayed? Unlike say LN which took a while due to challenges such as UX, there was always a blueprint to shift things over to node validators. They keep pushing the date out without doing anything about inflation. This is great for miners, but not for Either holders. Any thoughts on that?  
As much as people shit on Charlie Lee for selling LTC at the top, I have to agree with him on one thing. The relative complexity that accompanies smart contracts means things aren't nearly as easy to pull off in this space as everyone envisioned.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:22:23
As always, unless you're some kind of hardcore day trader, just average in. Buy weekly or biweekly depending on your preferred timeframe. It could drop to $3k or rise to $12k, we don't know. Dollar cost averaging makes the entire process less stressful and lets you lower your average buy-in cost during times like these.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:37:44


Haven't seen any info confirming that. And it's still 20,000 BTC left.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:09:21
Tough life.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:50:24
Annnnnnnnnd just like that, [Tether gets minted]( to buy at lows. Pump incoming, folks. I wouldn't discourage scalping a brief pump.
@_date: 2019-12-09 17:25:49


Then how was I able to sell my entire position at $17.5k back in December of 2017?  Hmm? Bitcoin has gone through its boom and bust cycles several times. This isn't the first rodeo for many of us.
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:43:33


In weighing the pros/cons and security vs convenience, Authy with multi-device use turned off has been my go-to for years. But once Yubico finally introduces their USB-C/NFC combo Yubikey Q1 of 2020, I'm probably switching for good.    
Still somewhat on the fence wrt whether to buy a cheap Linux notebook for when I'm handling my wallets and crypto purchases.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:10:30
I'd say about 2% tops of my portfolio is spread out across a couple of exchanges. No intention of withdrawing such a pitiful sum.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:25:52
That's what's key here. It's when you start seeing influential people outside the typical crypto community signaling it becomes a big deal.  
Does this mean we're at the bottom? Hard to say. I'm still buying regularly.
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:23:43
The way I see it, the only time things in the crypto world appear to be "priced in" is generally *after* something happens. During alt season, a company simply announcing a logo change would trigger a price jump within minutes. But again, only after.  
But Bitcoin's price reflecting the halvening? Pffffft. 4 months is a goddamn eternity in the crypto world. It's simply human nature to write off events happening in the oh-so-distant future as being too low priority to do anything to prepare for it. And even if they're not in that camp, they're jumping around in alt pumps these days.  
They say patience is a virtue with good reason. It gets rewarded. And I do think we will see some heavy price action in the months following it. Miners aren't going to abandon Bitcoin due to reduced rewards when the newer mining machines being launched in 2020 are going to be more power efficient and compensate for the payment reduction.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:39:22
Damn people at Huobi are selling off the BTC seized from the PlusToken scam and shorting BTC at the same time. Would be nice to know when that selloff is due to end.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:12:49


Couple things, my dude.  
The running joke over at r/investing is that people who hoard solid gold medallions have mental issues.  
Is it still doable? Sure, why not? But you'd have to keep a safe or invest in some hidden compartment to store said physical medallions. More people like likely to know to steal and pawn off a box full of medallions than they are to understand how to crack an encrypted partition with your seed phrase in it, and that's assuming they even know it's there. If robbers take your gold medallions, you're screwed. Much easier to create an encrypted Bitcoin wallet using a flash drive or to store a 24 or 25-word seed in a hidden PC partition offline. Only way someone knows that partition exists if they have the password.   
Yes, there are likely rich people out there with millions worth of gold stored in vaults who are okay with paying hefty fees for security and transport. But I'm going to assume you're not one of them. Worry not, neither are most of us. Point being--that makes solid gold a nonhedge for most of us.   
The only other conceivable way gold would be a hedge would be if you bought shares or ETFs. Think SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) or shares in gold mining companies a-la SPDR Gold Mining (GLDM). At that point, it's not a whole lot different from investing in stocks in that all that can be seized by the government. And you have to actually liquidate such shares/ETFs into cash before they can be spent. Whereas with the passing years, we're witnessing more and more means of spending our crypto.
I don't think the time is ripe yet to start buying up GLD personally, though when it does come around, I do plan to take a small position in it alongside more BTC as usual because why not?
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:33:11
Too many moonkiddies in this space. These dumps are good for culling them out. Bought some more at $6.6k, probably going to wait for my dip fund to replenish and let my current holdings pump.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:42:33
Oh please, enough with being so dramatic. Do you really think the printing presses that are the central banks don't have enough money to buy all the Bitcoin on spot exchanges? Has it not occurred to you it wouldn't be difficult for China to collude with other countries to arrest Bitcoin miners and sabotage things for us?  
We're nothing more than a blip on the radar, perhaps a reminder that the current fiat system as it is is flawed.
@_date: 2019-12-08 10:31:04
We've had a couple of days where the candles poked through the 21-day EMA, but failed to break decisively. We need strong support at the high $7k to $8k levels. In being below all major moving averages followed, everyone's just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for things to dump to lower levels before buying (but we know if it dumps to $6.5k, they'll just say they're waiting for $4k instead).  
Goes without saying no one knows where it'll go. As always, it seems like the best move really is to buy in increments at the time frame of choice.
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:17:04


Is it really *your* money, or is it being [loaned out at 3, 4, 5x its base value to other banks and companies?]( And with the defi movement taking off, how much % interest can you earn on it in a measly savings account before the bank takes a huge cut?   
How long have you even been in this space? Before you spout on and on about how it's fast and free, spend a bit of time learning the basics first. Nothing is free.

@_date: 2019-12-17 20:23:29
Possibly. Maybe. Quite a few were calling a Thanksgiving week or December holiday dump-off a while back. Feels somewhat similar to when some of my stocks a couple years ago faced a mysterious double digit % dump before mooning by almost 2x over a year later.  
Sure hope we can recapture $7k support soon. The longer we stay here, the more bearish sentiment will get.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:39:39
Best not to announce to random people on the web how much you have. Social engineering attacks are a thing.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:34:14

Like what they've done, but I'd still use Gemini ActiveTrader over Cash App. Lower fees.
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:13:15
Now we just need Trezor and Ledger to get on it as well. If the bull run really comes around soon, this would be a good next step for easing transaction congestion.
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:30:18
That applies to just about any risky asset out there. If there's anyone who wasn't aware of that, they shouldn't be here. Or spending money on anything remotely risky at all.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:51:50


Why are you putting rent money into something so volatile and risky as cryptos?
