Can I run mainnet and testnet simultaneously on the same computer?

I’ll try? A SegWit address is simply an address that utilizes SegWit (Segregated Witness). Segregated Witness is exactly that: rather than your transaction input data being followed by the witness (the unlocking script or signature for the transaction input), the witness is separated out into its own data structure. The main thing most people bring up with SegWit is that separating out the witness allows a smaller transaction string to be validated by the miners, meaning more transactions can get in to a block, reducing the mempool and driving down prices. Your transaction is also cheaper because less data has to be included in the main transaction string. Some of the features of SegWit will also allow more complex transactions and make it easier for second layer technologies to work with Bitcoin.

Can you run mainnet and testnet3 nodes simultaneously?

My personal view is that we should be working towards a world where we can triple (or more) our energy consumption without environmental impacts through the use of clean/renewable energy systems. Throwing out revolutionary technologies because we aren’t willing to adopt cleaner solutions shouldn’t be considered imho

I finally got mine fired up. I decided I didn’t really need my laptop for much, so I threw Ubuntu on it and I’m running a full node. Maybe in the future I can run some test net stuff. Next step is to take my wallet in to my own hands

The “killer app” of bitcoin is money. The killer app of ethereum is governance.
Lightning is the first step in scaling, but there are many more. Do scaling as a second layer first, focus on privacy for the bade layer. Any scaling on the second layer can be improved exponentially on the base layer once improvements are made there. Privacy should be the focus for bitcoin core and the base layer, because privacy is the foundation of all rights.

On top of the software and install they have a decent tutorial. I’ll admit that I’ve struggled on a few parts of it though. 
Once you’ve got your node setup, [   seems to be a decent GUI. And they’ve got [lndconnect]( that allows you to connect an app on your phone to your lightning node. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:32:54
Or more people bragging about their lightning nodes or asking wtf they’re doing wrong and why their lndconnect won’t produce a proper link for their zap mobile app to work... kinda specific, I know. Maybe I’ll actually ask...

 I bought AAPL in 2009 or 2010 thinking “well, I probably missed the boat but I don’t know what else to invest in” and my investment has more than doubled since then.

I’ve got a trezor currently and a couple cold cards on the way, will I be able to help troubleshoot anything (My programming knowledge is enough to make slight tweaks to excel macros)? I take it I’ll need another computer to run testnet since mine is preoccupied with Bitcoin core and lightning?

Smaller governments may be in a position where if bitcoin succeeds and it’s people are at the forefront of it, their people will prosper. While governments want to wield power over their citizenry, they also grow their power globally when their people prosper.
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:25:34
Wouldn’t the downside be that it allows supply-side economics to go on unabated even if it proves to be damaging? I may be projecting my views here, but I think paying people to go in debt prevents them from being more upset that they aren’t being paid more and their governments provide more benefits to “haves” than “have-nots”?

No, Schnorr doesn’t help with quantum resistance, it was just that in a recent dev email, which was mostly focused on Schnorr signatures, there was a summary of “what needs to be worked on now/next” and quantum resistance was on the short list.

I’ve really appreciated his books (and videos on YouTube of course). I also like that he really promotes that “investing” in bitcoin should be learning the technology rather than buy-hodl-moon-lambo, and encourages what you (hopefully) seem to be trying, which is learning and becoming involved in the communities. If you get a chance, see one of his talks, more so to learn a thing or two and meet people that are in the community than to fanboy/fan girl for him. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:13:43
It’s not much, just a small blurb that shows that it’s being looked at. References that it could be added at the same soft fork as Shnorr, but should probably be left til later
“different cryptosystems (eg, 384 bit curves for better protection
   against future quantum computing advances; conceivably pairing curves?)”

This is a [single email]( from one of the devs working on Schnorr. Maybe you can peruse some of the links and learn more. Or just email the guy

Actually something I’ve thought a bit too. Sure, BTC @ $1mil sounds great, but does the value of $1mil go down at that time too?

Do you get that error everywhere or just on certain networks? Is your lnd node on a fixed IP address? I’m sure the folks on the slack channel will get you squared away pretty quick

Awesome that they got you straightened out so quickly. I fought with that for a while, didn’t think to go straight to the source. 
It’s an awesome UI, but there’s a few kinks on getting it all running the first time.

He’s talking the bitcoin. USD in a coinbase wallet is FDIC insured. And bitcoin being about financial sovereignty, it wouldn’t make sense to have someone else hold your keys

Some people are willing to ride it to zero because they see it as the only hope of righting the ship. The more I read and spend time in the space, the more I’m moved in that direction.

I’m struggling currently. Might be because I was already running a full node and lnd has a very specific set of instructions

It’s a disappointing outlook to think we can’t advance as a society within the threat of climate change. If everyone mines now, yes it is more polluting than otherwise simply because most energy comes from dirty sources (but even there, clean energy is in ways subsidized because it can be cheaper to mine with renewable sources). In the future (if changes are made) we will have access to vastly more energy than we currently do. The long term goal (I think) should be to use more energy more cleanly than we do today rather than use less energy, because otherwise we stagnate as a society. 
If you consider the Kardashev scale, we aren’t even a Type I society (using the total energy potential of our planet). Type II would be harnessing all of the sun’s energy, which seems like a better goal than to give up on progress because we’re not willing to pool resources to develop clean energy sources. 
A larger county in Texas would be the total landmass of solar needed to power the entire US. Fusion could be a possibility in our lifetimes. Some great progress is being made and it’s barely being taken seriously yet.

I keep larger sums in a Trezor wallet, and smaller sums in BRD, bitcoin core, and LND wallets. I have iOS and when I was settling, I liked BRD the best. Not sure if it’s still tops for iOS though

Schnorr signatures is another manner of improving scaling by allowing multiple signatures to be combined as one. Some proponents believe this could reduce block size by as much as 25%
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:09:41
Yeah, I tend to agree, so it’s a bit of a cop-out posting the most optimistic take from an article on medium. I think the article may have been written before Segway was mass adopted, so I’m not sure that was totally considered. Still some decent potential. 1 or 2 percent on normal transactions and whatever the difference on Multi-sig

When you’re looking long term and you believe in a position, sometimes you like to see it go down. I love when Apple and Caterpillar are down, because they’ve doubled and then some for me

The idea is that if you transact, you have your own instance of seeing that the blockchain has properly transcribed your transaction. You aren’t just trusting a central bank that it happened, you are the bank and have proof of your transaction. Plus it further decentralized the blockchain and ensures it will continue to be used (in the event that other nodes are taken out)
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:18:02
Thanks, I’ve been wondering what this was all about, since I thought the general r/bitcoin philosophy was not your keys not your coins.

If you read any of the dev work (especially with Schnorr signatures coming around the corner), they have defense against quantum computing as something to pursue in the mid to short term

The more I hear about the work being done in bitcoin, the more BCH seems a cop-out to me. Extensive work is going into improving scalability with increasing block size as much further down the line (but may eventually happen). BCH seems to have taken the easiest path to get people to buy in because it was so obvious, and didn’t concern themselves with how else to improve. Maybe I’m too much of a maximalist (though I’m all for ETH, and interested in Zcash and Monero).
