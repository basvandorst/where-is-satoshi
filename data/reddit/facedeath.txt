just think how hard you punch yourself having $100,000,000 usd if you'd just not got those 2 pizzas in 2010.

congrats on being in the .1%, illuminati confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:18:44
It's not about wealth, it's about a great life with lot's of things like cars and a ridiculous house so you can flash your face to the world to sell them your how to be rich programs!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:41:35
All the bitcoins would have to be bought in order to reach that price, like $150 Billion of them, the order books are just doing their job based on the illuminati not buying the entire market at once.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:07:26
40k would be about 900 trillion market cap, i concur there will be some major shifts before then.

.73 x 1,000,000 = 730,000 usd
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:36:12
don't give them rides in your lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:38:02
Yeah, it's variable rate, but the shit has been going up year over year. Take your chances, but even the smallest bit of research/logic says that this early your odds are infinitely better than a guess. Also you don't have to buy ALL IN at once, let the market move, watch and react appropriately.

exactly this. Bitcoin is a store of value, and because it is deflationary there no chance of it losing value to an outside source creating more. It is the inverse of toilet paper. 
There may be a better system that comes along. Look at it like the early adoption of the internet. At first very few were using it or understood how, it was troublesome and clanky, slow and had to be used at home. Now you can look up random crap or order a pizza while sitting at a red light and streaming music from a device that fits in the palm of your hand. Bitcoin can adapt. It's digital and can evolve, or should those who develop it choose not to evolve, it will be left behind for better tech that meets the needs of the future. It is a pandoras box for how we view and use currency.

you'll find out in 2020.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:59:38
I don't think it's too late, but each time it goes up the risk/reward is lowered upon entry.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:15:00
I always found the sentiment of willing to lose money idiotic. I will not risk a single dollar, GONDOR IS MINE AND MINE ALONE.
