At first - Holy Shit why didn't I do that.
Checked later, it was just sent by the creator to himself. Check the blockchain transaction.

If any new users need a referral
You will need to become identified to receive the Bitcoins, It requires a scan of photo ID and a recent bank statement, or GreenID

Sorry for your loss.
Look into forensic data recovery services. Not cheap, but worth it, if it is a large amount of bitcoins.

Don't worry it's impossible to lose coins this way. What wallet program are you using to send the funds. You will need to rebroadcast the transaction, Google the methods to do this for your wallet program.

Well i believe its a strong assumption that nobody would tip 21btc in a single tip.

I never researched the owner of the paper and I am wary off much of the news due to rupert owning most of it.
By national I just meant it was available nationally thanks for clearing that up.

Circle was very easy when I signed up a few months ago. My Commonwealth card wouldn't work but my visa NAB card did.

Glad to see they've addressed the block size issue.

This gives people with the most money the power. One could simply generate many wallets to overcome upper limits.
adding the need to use a verified (identified) wallet to limit it to one submission per person would be similar to simply voting on what the taxes should be spent on.
