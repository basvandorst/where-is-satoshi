USA is one of the only countries in the world that still demands taxes on money earned abroad. So now you owe taxes to the local government and to your home country where you aren't even using services. If you want to free yourself of this burden you have to relinquish your citizenship at a cost of around $6k, plus a good-bye tax on everything you own. Love it or leave it, if you can afford to.

An excellent subreddit name! I think it should work similar how changetip works, it'd have to be centralized. You load up your account with what you want to bid with and you can only bid with what is in your account. Once you have your account funded you can "bid $1" by commenting in the topic with an active listing. If your bid is the highest bid or the only bid it will lock those funds so you can't withdraw them. You or another bidder can then bid again and it will be accepted only if it is a higher amount than the current highest bid. Once a new highest bidder is accepted the previous highest bid is nullified and the funds unlocked available for withdraw or to be used to bid in another auction. If the Auction time expires, the seller and buyer are notified and the funds are released to the winner.
New auctions could be initiated with a command "new 24h $5", this will start a new 24 hour auction with the bidding to start at $5.

Speaking of predicting the future, Dr. Michio Kaku is a respected leader on the subject. He has been very tight lipped about bitcoin. I wonder if this is because he is afraid to get it wrong or if he thinks it would be interpreted as financial advice and doesn't want to tip the scales. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

It's kinda sketchy putting money in.. and it's where hackers like to cash their bitcoin out. So you have a higher supply of bitcoin and more of a demand for fiat creating the difference. Not too much of a difference though because the reward of profit from arbitrage outweighs the risk of loss and balances everything out.

For example, currently everyone trying to buy iota In the US has to go through coinbase to get coins to buy on bitfinex. Everyone is buying Ethereum because it's cheaper to send. Who wouldn't? 
Now that i think about it like that I'm starting to wonder if bcash has a place next to bitcoin? I wrote it off before, hmm.

Transaction speed is abnormal on the Bcash chain. I would not classify that as better. The fact that people are willing to pay such a high fee to use the bitcoin network is a good thing. Nobody would transact on the Bcash network at that fee because the demand and utility are not there. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:22:58
I don't mind selling to buy back in lower if I can. But I will always buy back in with Bitcoin. Bitcoin only though, no BCHes allowed. I don't think the risk of missing the train is worth the reward of getting more btc so I will just hodl.

Bitcoin has changed, it grew up. Just like gold was once used for transactions before bitcoin, the use case changed as the value climbed. It's still an 800 lb gorilla that continues to appreciate to this day but nobody really uses it like they used to because really only the rich can afford it. And that's okay, sometimes that's just the way it is. But if you are still stuck trying to use gold for everything you're going to have a bad time.

Interesting. Can you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:46:09
No, It's not broken. Bitcoin's ledger simply has more demand than there will ever be supply so fees aren't going away, ever. If you don't want to pay fees you'll have to use IOTA which has 0 tx fees. Bitcoin isn't a coffee buying wallet, it's a big boy wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-30 17:32:17
It's ironic that Bitcoin is modeled after gold in the sense that gold is an 800 lb gorilla that nobody really uses to transact anymore because it's too expensive and you get raped on the exchange rate. You see the same thing happening with Bitcoin. The scaling solution has alleviated the effects for now it seems but it will only get worse in the future. Not that it's a bad thing, just the way it is. Gold continues to appreciate it just has a different use now as a store of value rather than a currency.

Pssst. It scales and there are no fees.

Traveling across a border is no joke, border agents give you shit about anything they can find. Check out Border Security Canada to see what it's like. You'd think the Canadians would be cool but not really, except they do let you off with a warning if you are bringing a small amount of bud. Although, they want the password to your laptop so they can inspect it and won't let you have it back unless you tell them. Other times if they catch you traveling with undeclared cash they can seize it, all of it if they suspect it's from illegal proceeds. If it's just a level 1 they make you pay $250 to get your money back. Oh, and if you have a DUI you're screwed.

Bitcoin and gold are both volatile. They have both crashed in the past. Nobody is denying this. They will do it again.  But the crash is usually higher than the last peak. So whats your point? 
If something better than bitcoin comes along, so be it. Just as bitcoin is better than gold, gold still stands on its own.  Bitcoin not risky enough for you? If you want to get in on the next big coin, go buy some altcoins. Don't come crying to us when you buy back into bitcoin at a big loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:52:38
Notice how there is a clear distinction between eth is ethereum and etc is ethereum classic, because there is consensus. Exchanges aren't listing both eth and etc as Ethereum. That would be retarded and fraudulent. BCH is no where near the level of support needed to make this claim, therefore it it's disingenuous at best, fraudulent if used for financial gain.

Start an exchange, start selling bch as bitcoin,  see if you don't get sued or prosecuted for fraud. No exchange is doing this, I wonder why? Even if it wasn't illegal (it is in just about every country) it is still morally wrong to deceive people.  
We aren't talking about 2 business people discussing bch and calling it bitcoin.  We are talking about deceiving the public on social media and exchanges.  
These fraudsters aren't even stopping at bitcoin. They want to confuse the ticker too for maximum deception and gains. If you are a supporting the deception, you are just as guilty. 
Dont be a scammer.

I have evidence that the core devs are wrong, they support the "XT is an altcoin" argument which is invalid. I don't have any evidence of XT being wrong from what I have seen, they have been most professional throughout this. I like to side with professionals when it comes to my money. If core is indeed right they sure aren't conveying it properly.

 that was a big if and many did not support this idea. It's not always black and white with hypotheticals.  BCH is clearly no where near the dominant chain. This can't be any more clear cut. If you are selling BCH as bitcoin you are committing fraud.  &lt;/thread&gt;

Supply and demand. I think the forks can coexist. Whichever one is more in demand will have the higher price. I could be wrong.  Segwit2x might be winner takes all so if you are worried about it just hold both. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:31:58
There is still mining.  The amount of bitcoins released per block is cut in half every 4 years. Started with 50 btc per block, then 25, now its at 12.5, next halving 6.25. Thats how the supply of bitcoins was introduced and the price is what keeps the miners mining.

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:15:32
Not at all. But you have to realize the ICO craze has given rise to hundreds maybe thousands of ICO scam coins, probably over 95% of ICOs are complete garbage. The average Joe doesn't know which ones are legit. I have millions of colored coins I will sell you for cheap if you want to get in at the bottom. Either way, that has nothing to do with bitcoin so I'm not sure what we are doing here.

Demand may go up or down but the supply of new coins is going down. Reduced supply will equal a higher price if demand is stagnant. Demand would have to be less than the dwindling supply. It happens occasionally but then demand goes up eventually and price catches back up. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:57:16
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:31:57

Listing BCH as Bitcoin. It clearly is not. 
If s2x killed off the original bitcoin then that is different, like i said originally. BCH is no where near this.

That argument doesn't fly when you are dealing with financial instruments. You need to be clear what you are selling. Bitcoin Cash has a name, use it. Bitcoin isn't a general term for cryptocurrency. If BCH wants to market itself with a generic name it could try "altcoin" or "shitcoin."

His comments are considered informational to help people learn.  Hes not telling you what to do just offering his opinion.

Edit: The thing that gets me is that there is not a single place to pay your bills in the US with Bitcoin, and Mint Bills is one of the better bill payment options. We should be pushing them to accept bitcoin for bill payment.

Just speculating here, I am not a Lawyer. You probably trigger a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) for potential structuring. They aren't legally able to tell you about it but are obligated to file. Basically the law says that any transaction over 10,000 must be reported and structuring is making several smaller transactions so that you don't have to report it. It's illegal if you did it intentionally.

He used the currency supply as an example of immutable, but the important thing actually is that the ledger is immutable. Nobody can go back in time to make transactions disappear or change account balances without holding the private key. Overall an excellent presentation of Bitcoin.

So are Gold bugs delusional? Gold is worth 6 trillion now, down from 10 trillion at its height. Bitcoin is technologically superior to gold. It's really not a stretch to think that Bitcoin will surpass gold. It's also worth noting that the market cap doesn't have anything in common with the GDP. Maybe volume would be a better comparison to GDP or maybe comparing market cap to the global value of all assets.

Right, I should have phrased it differently. This is what it would lead to if someone threatened by Bitcoin would want to suppress the price. They do it with gold and silver and Bitcoin is modeled after gold. So if wall street is getting in it would seem plausible that they would be working on pulling something like this. Not necessarily on this futures exchange.

I was hoping some other reputable people would chime in with their success or failure. Have you ever heard of a minimum withdraw that is larger than the fee? What other use could this minimum have other than to steal customer funds? Even if I managed to get my funds by sending more, the fact this minimum even exists seems to me would qualify it as a scam. 
I recognize the catch-22 of this but i was just pointing out my options and asking advice.  
Edit: l first joined to get a bitcoin debit card. I transferred some bitcoin and paid for the card, i think it was $10 at the time. Never did get my card. I forgot about it for a couple years.
