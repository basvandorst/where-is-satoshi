what exactly do you expect us to do...and your willing to pay almost $3k? so what you lost like $30k?
Dude you clearly are chinese and live in china. You were born knowing not to trust your fellow citizens. Let alone a company that can vanish in seconds.

It's just bad taste, not even funny and shows the writer really sucks at their job. Couldn't think of something else?
maybe bots are writing these, then it makes complete sense, bots dont give a fuck about massacres, if its similar its similar

might make sense, to state those opinions, otherwise why are you pointing that out in a thread about Trezors.

They've existed for awhile, they were one of the first ATMs and seem to be one of the few that actually lasted from the start.
I'm surprised HK doesn't have more ATM's though, atleast a few more are needed for that kind of financial based population.

he for sure is and its hilarious because...its these low level, wannabe traders / "omg i can retire at 40 by doing nothing or even learning anything" that are really muddying up the water recently. Especially with their cocky attitude....remember the most ignorant person will think they are genius, its in their nature.
yet he's telling rich people they shouldn't do it. Holy shit, there really are dumbass people.

dude chill the fuck out, you're the one that came through having a cunt fest.
jesus christ man, the TSA is known to steal shitload of items from AMERICAN CITIZENS.
And you choose this to knock the guy from? I'm sure he does some other stupid hipster shit you can have a valid point on.
But yo, make sure to chill out, the fact that you choose to be angry towards a fellow citizen is crazy...share love or knowledge. Especially in a situation in which the government has fabricated, you going along with it makes you equally culpable. You allowed their blatant rights violations to continue. Stop thinking you dont matter or have power, thats their entire goal.

you do realize that it is us who are making it a currency. It can literally be used for whatever, it does not have to be pegged to monetary.
words have meaning? yea and a decentralized system is NATURALLY an attractive option compared to other options.
so you can fuck off mate.

No intrinsic value? storage of wealth, ability to use it worldwide, ability to transfer one currency to another using it. ability to not have funds taken away....then in the coming years we will have products and the like based off of bitcoins blockchain etc.
There's plenty of value.
Also, nobody fucking said bitcoin was a currency. so stop parroting that like its true.
Holy fuck dude, you know nothing.

All of those things aren't real issues, the media told you they were. Everyone says they don't hate black people, then why do we have a society in which they are suppressed? 
My dude, wake the fuck up and stop being constantly scared or offended.
He made a point, younger individuals would be more likely to hold, seeing the real value. Older individuals, which I have encountered as well are all skepticism and negativity. Shorting, or spouting bullshit, while not even understanding the fiat market.
but we should all hold hands, right?
