I would love to know more details and I'm sure eventually we will but it seems nearly impossible to rule out that, at minimum, inside help wasn't provided.  
How could you be "quite positive with high  degree of certainty".  Whoever came up with that line would be the first person that I would be looking at!

What about users BTC that was not stolen but were stuck in long positions due to being locked out while the market tanked due to Bitfinex's security breach, through no fault of their own?
At this point, I think the only fair solution is to liquidate all BTC margin positions at the market price at the time that site went offline.  (The market would not have tanked like this without the breach) therefore how could you penalize long positions and reward shorts who were stuck in their positions with no recourse?

You said that you were going to release a calculation on how you arrived at the 36% haircut across the board.  I was expecting this to happen BEFORE the site came back online but that apparently is not the case.
When will this be published?  Will this line item each asset class, Bitfinex's contribution, etc?
It does seem hard to believe that there was only $4.6 million in users unlent wallets considering we know there was (I believe) at least $2M on the lending offer order book.

Does BitGo even offer multi-sig for ether?  I was under the (false?) assumption that BitGo was 100% bitcoin  In fact, a search of their website mentions bitcoin many times but there is no reference to ether.
Either way, even if they do, it's slimy.  I read that 0.5% in hot wallets and assumed it meant bitcoin (at minimum) or all currencies.  To claim that line was only for ether when it didn't specify that is at minimum misleading and at maximum an outright lie (or attempted coverup).  There is NO way that anyone could read that page and realize that line only referred to ether.

Why didn't either company have a circuit breaker in place to me is dumbfounding.  At minimum, Bitgo was negligent and IMHO should be somewhat accountable for the losses.

They are not choosing the best legal path.  If they are insolvent the best legal path is to file bankruptcy.  They are choosing the best path that they think will keep them in business.
IMHO, if they go down this path they will be both bankrupt and individually liable for illegally distributing funds from an insolvent company.

One item that is being overlooked is the cost involved in closing all margin BTCUSD positions at the $604.06 USD when the real BTC price is lower.  We know there were far more margin longs than shorts therefore to close out those longs surely had a cost that needs to be factored in.

Can someone please ELI5 in what value BitGo provided to Bitfinex (with the information that we now know)?
If they were automatically approving transactions, doesn't that defeat the security purpose of a multi-sig wallet?  Especially if they were auto approving transactions at a ridiculous rate with no circuit breakers or alerts in place?
How was this any different then Bitfinex having individual hot wallets for each customer?

Confirmed.  I'm in this boat.

Because no fiat is traded on Polo.  Obviously, if no fiat is on exchange then it will have no fiat volume. ;)

If you don't file a loss on your return you can't add it during an audit.  An audit can only increase your income/capital gains or leave them unchanged.

Disregard the redeemable portion for a second, we know that TOS language is horrific but it does not mean they are trying to defraud customers.
Assuming what he said is true then that completely refutes your claim that Bitfinex paid off their tokens by simply issuing new Tether tokens from thin air without firm segregated USD backing.
Absolutely nothing I have seen or read this far suggests this is anything other than what they claim;. banking issues from banks refusing to relay their wires.
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:22:31
Let's be clear, the Tether TOS are awful.  They deserve to be called out and pressure put on them to change the terrible language.  I'd be surprised if that language ever held up in ANY court of law.
With that said, there is absolutely zero proof that what you claim is true.  In fact, your post title states it as fact when it is entirely your speculation based on tinfoil hat theories.
I have zero problem with holding Bitfinex and Tether accountable.  However, devising conspiracy theories and posting them as fact, is irresponsible and IMHO should not be permitted.  You have already been banned from we don't need your conspiracy theories here.

The Bitfinex attorney said that some of the principals of iFinex own 40 percent of Tether.  That means that 60% of Tether is owned by others with no relation to Bitfinex.
If you think that the 60% of Tether ownership would gladly hand over money to the remaining 40% (Bitfinex) then I have some snake oil to sell you.
There is absolutely no proof or reason to believe that Tether does not have have a 1 USD backing each and every Tether USD as they have stated.

Thank you.

So, you were one of (if not the first) to learn about withdraw's not going through and announced it prior to Bitfinex announcing it.  There was sound evidence that something was wrong and you reported on the facts.  Nice work.
Unfortunately, since you were the first to report that, you somehow think that you have a pedestal to brew up any tinfoil hat theory that you want and claim that is also true.  Sorry, it doesn't work that way.  Bring clear evidence to the table or stop spreading lies and FUD.  Right now there is zero evidence of anything, that you have claimed in this thread as true.  Instead, you have taken some numbers and combined it with some concocted theory and are presenting it as a fact.
Provide clear evidence or stop spreading FUD.

Bitnodes shows 6887 active nodes.  How does Luke Jr get to 55,000+?

A clear statement with the following would go a long way:
1.  Are Bitfinex and Tether's bank accounts segregated from each other?
2.  Has Tether ever been issued without 1 USD being deposited into a segregated Tether bank account?

How long did it last?  Only an hour (or few), right?
