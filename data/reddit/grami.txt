I really enjoy this community war. People are people, I love people. 
I don't think Core or BU can win the fight without some sort of compromise. The real question - are they ready to cooperate?

I'm telling about the refund transaction. The refund transaction could become invalid if you malate the initial transaction. In that case you will wait until the channel expires to get your money back. This means you don't want to open extra long/infinite channels. And this means lightning become less usable without fixing transaction malleability.
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:09:26
Your refund transaction could become invalid if other party malate the txn. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:49:32
That is true. But you have to choose the duration of a channel before the initial transaction is confirmed.

One thing that bugs me is that non-DNMs price-sensitive customers are being forced out of blockchain. And they have only alt-coin options available. I would be happy with SW/LN or BU or with both.

Thank you for the polite discussion.

Just looked. There is just one recent post talking about backlog. People seems not pissed at all. They are rich enough to not care about fees.

You can create a SegWit transaction with 1000 BTC in fees. That would help.

It reminds me 2013. SR was shot down by LE. It was a big event. It was expected that the price of BTC will significantly crash immideaty. But it didn't. Deep pockets knew about upcoming hearings in the Senate. They were buying the dip. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:12:49
What will the Core team do in November if SW is not activated?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:13:25
George Kikvadze is the poor negotiator with large ego. (I know him in person). I hope for the best, but I will be surprised if he succeeds.
Edit: In his favor, it is worth saying that he is an active person. There is a crisis - got on the plane and is already talking to key people.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:21:27
I'm also against the stalemate. But for me UASF is a wishful thinking. It could work if every miner would be honest. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:08:21
What do you mean by "you folks"?
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:46:48
Thank you so much! And the last one, please. What in your opinion would the Core team do in the case if BU successfully hard fork the network?

Neither majority nor minority MUST NOT be able to override Satoshi's original vision.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:28:21
(1) - is so easy to happen.
(2) - is by default. You don't want UAFS if you have support from the majority of miners.

SegWit txns are "anyone can spend" txns to non-upgraded miners. If they have the majority of hash power then literally anyone could broadcast a transaction that steals SW money. Minority of hash power will refuse such a txn and a hard fork will happen.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:24:05
Great work!
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:07:10
What would a non-SW miner do if he receives a block with the anyone-can spend txn? He wouldn't know if the txn is a SW txn or just a valid anyone-can-spend. My guess he would accept the block and the network split would happen.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:30:29
I really don't understand how UASF can fly.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:08:49
If the majority of miners (by hash power) are upgraded to SW then why do you need UASF at all?
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:01:14


Why do think this is unlikely? I think this is a way to go. Make a very gentle 51% attack - don't make all non-SW blocks obsolete - only make obsolete a 5%, after a while - 10% and so on. Almost no risk. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:09:18
It could be done 
But, I'm not aware of anyone doing this.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:08:03
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:32:47
How do you think, is there are any chance the Core team will release a hard fork with SW and maybe with some block size increase?

A chain with unlimited blocksize and low mining subsidies is unstable. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:48:54
The truth is ASICs sellers are selling you 0.9BTC for 1BTC. You can still make profit if the BTC price is going up, but why should you do mining for that. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:36:17
If the subsidy is 1BTC and mining fees = 30BTC then it is rational to try stealing blocks. That is true if you can take all 30BTC, if not (if blocksize is limited) then it is rational to mine as usual.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:30:49
We can face this already in 2020-2024, but for example let it be 2027, ten years is not a big deal for the currency. The subsidy will be 3.125 BTC per block. Now let's say that for a couple of hours there are no blocks and in the mempool there are transactions with a total commission of 100 BTC. This is also possible. Then miner1 generates block N and takes all transactions to it - the final reward of the miner = 103.125BTC. He can do that because the blocksize is unlimited (or effective unlimited). Miner2 sees block N and understands that if he generates block N + 1, his maximum reward is 3.125BTC (the mempool is empty). But if Miner2 has 30% of the network hashrate, then it can generate blocks N and N + 1 in a row with a probability of 9% and its expected return is 9% * (103.125 + 3.125) = 9.585BTC. Therefore, miner2 will try to steal the fee from the miner1. This will lead to instability of blockchain due to permanent reorg.
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:21:21
when 95% of miners is ready then it is safe to update. when we will have 51+ we can hurry the rest by ignoring half of their blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:28:37
Because you have the same new money in each block, but transactions fees can vary. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:16:02
It is not rational to steal right now. Right now miner2 will receive 12.5BTC - a lot more than he could have get if he had tried to steal fees.

Will we have a 21% percent attack one day with BIP-100?
If an attacker have 21% of hashpower he will be able to reduce blocksize back to 1MB with BIP100.

I believe that there are many use-cases for on-chain transactions with $0.1-0.49 fees. These use-cases are expelled out of the blockchain. Why is that bad? This reduces the network effect of Bitcoin.

The question is why AntPool signal don't have a SegWit bit. Until BIP91 is active this is safe, but when active BIP91 will reject blocks not signalling v20000012.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:23:50


This is a small regional TV channel. They are really talking about loans in bitcoins. Aside from this interview there will be a bill about cryptocurrencies in Russia somewhere in October-November but nobody knows what is inside the bill now. It is work in progress. This report is pure speculation.

@_date: 2017-07-17 11:29:54
A very interesting point. Bitmain signal v20000010 but they should signal v20000012 instead. This is safe until BIP91 is activated.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:38:17
Since core nodes/miners will have less than 20% of hashpower and they will consider 80% of blocks as valid they will mine on top of those 80% blocks. This is how softforks work.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:34:54
Yes, they will have plenty of time.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:08:58
I've captured this on the phone
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:49:38
There would be some orphan blocks. Since BIP91 is backward compatible there shouldn't be a split. But once activated, BIP91 will reject non-segwit blocks and that raises a question why Bitmain doesn't signal segwit.
