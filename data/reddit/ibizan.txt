Catching a falling knife rarely works out well. How would you know the bottom’s been reached before you buy in again? What if the price immediately shoots up instead (after you sell)? If it’s worrying you, perhaps consider pulling out only the principal amount you’ve already invested.

Any particular reasons for choosing CXBTF over GBTC?

Good to know, thanks for the heads up. Will take a closer look at CXBTF.

Can you recommend a good mobile software wallet to use (until these Ledger Nano S supplies catch up to the their demand)? I was eyeing Mycelium or Breadwallet but can't tell if one is more preferable over the other.

Excellent, I'll try them all out, thanks for the guidance!

Ooof! I'd say you're a battle-hardened Bitcoin veteran by now.

There's enough room in the market for both coins to co-exist and serve different needs/use cases and there's no need for any coin to actively spread propaganda to sway (uninformed) public opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:49:30
You’re thinking of Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:45:45
Segwit is but it's up to the other members of the Bitcoin ecosystem (exchanges, wallets, etc.) to adopt it. You'd have to ask them why they've chosen not to. Core developers can't control that. 
As for the block size increase: I used to think this too, until I watched this video: 
That clearly explains why bigger blocks are cause for concern. It's effectively a short-term, band-aid solution but once deployed, can't be rolled back, eventually leading to mining and node centralization. Side-chain (2nd layer) transactions are the future and necessary for SAFE mass adoption/use, and again, need proper time for testing and implementation. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:45:03
In line with what you've learned, this part of Antonopoulous's explanation about the risks of not scaling properly solidified my thoughts on this: 
At the risk of diminished public support in the short-term, it's better for developers to plan properly and take it slow to ensure the technology is right.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:15:40
No, because nobody is selling their ₿ anywhere near 3859! The quicker you want to fill your limit order, the closer your bid price has to be to the spread (the gap between the highest bid and lowest ask price). Example: you can set your bid to 7700 and hope the market dips a bit and your order will fill.

Gemini’s transfers to your wallet are free but only because they cover the mining fee on your behalf.

Always diversify.

Transfers out of GDAX to external addresses are free. And you can potentially set limit buy orders that are also free.

I expect these will start going down in price across the board, as the new, updated Trezor model is set to ship in January.

It can be a bit tricky if there’s a buying frenzy at the moment. Tends to work quicker when you set your buy price a few cents below the current highest bid price.  If your bid is much lower than the current price, not much you can do except wait/hope for the market’s movement to shift downward eventually.

Do you have any thoughts with regard to how long they can sustain this BCH pump?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:17:16
Unfortunately not, just partial coins for close to the bid-ask spread.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:16:10
Yep, wash trades all around to boost the volume and give the impression of a buying frenzy. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:33:42
If the massive bank lobby/special interest groups sway the U.S. government to ban crypto exchanges (a possibility), how would one move fiat to other exchanges (outside the U.S.) to buy crypto? This ban necessarily assumes that American banks would also deny transfers and wires to any crypto-related businesses. 
A ban wouldn’t outright kill bitcoin (in America) but it sure would make it a royal pain in the ass to acquire. If liquidity becomes a real issue, mass adoption would certainly slow to a trickle.

I don’t think anyone here actually cares that this article is linked to Forbes in any form nor was anyone claiming it was “breaking news.” Did you look at his bio? This article could’ve came from Bogart’s personal Tumblr blog and it still wouldn’t have made his opinions, as you put it, any less interesting nor valid (of which they are). Better to debate the content rather than the format in which it’s presented.

Transfer your coins to GDAX first (if you have access) for free, then onward to your external wallet. It’ll still sit in the mempool for a while but at least the fees will be covered by CB/GDAX.

For Cypriots, is there another means of acquiring bitcoin (other than opening a checking account at another bank)?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:41:46
Especially since the cause was Bithumb (with the largest BCH trading volume) going down for the past hour. Once their servers are back up, I assume the pumping will continue. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:34:11


Time will tell. In the meanwhile, everyone's free to use whichever cryptocurrencies suits their needs at the present moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:41:07
Coming from Forbes and its digital STD-laden website, this is actually a rather well-written article that conveys comprehension of the scaling situation at hand (with a slightly misleading title, however). The author's points about second-layer solutions in due time certainly convinces me that Segwit2X would've been an ill-advised maneuver, emphasizing short-term benefits at the cost of the longer-term greater good.

Coinbase gives you the price at the time of purchase, regardless of how long the ACH transfer takes to arrive.

Actually, no. Several U.S expat friends in both London and Zurich promptly had their savings/checking accounts closed and their balances refunded as a paper check, after FATCA legislation was finalized. They were told, in not so many words, that American clients were now too much of a pain in the ass to maintain due to onerous annual paperwork filings on their behalf, as required by the IRS. 
That said, I don’t know if using ₿ as a replacement would be manageable (at this point in time), given its day-to-day volatility. Would be great though if it worked. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:43:07
Unfortunately, no. This is not how whales operate. This is a common maneuver in several types of markets, particularly with forex and commodities. A sell-off of this magnitude is intended to trigger stop loss orders wherein the seller (typically in a coordinated effort with a few other individuals) swoops back in to buy back their coins and many, many more at significantly reduced prices, increasing their holdings and reducing their overall cost basis. While ethically dubious, this is perfectly legal and their goal is to acquire more over time.

If you move the ₿ from your Coinbase wallet back to GDAX, then transfer your coins from GDAX to any external address/wallet, it’s free.

Transfer the ₿ from your Coinbase wallet to GDAX (instant and free) then transfer it from there to an external wallet address. With this method, the transfer is free. You automatically have access to GDAX if you have a Coinbase account (same company), unless you live in a state like Minnesota.

The seed is created fresh every time the Ledger is initialized, it’s NOT one set of mnemonic phrases per device as you’re implying. So if you’re unsure, simply reset the device (or enter the PIN incorrectly 3x) to generate a new seed.

We’re going way off-topic here but ok, let’s roll with this. 
Eating dogs is a “backward cultural thing” according to whom? Different animals are eaten by different cultures all over the world. Why are some animals “okay to eat” over others? Because you’re used to seeing a particular species run around your house and fetch slippers? Do you eat pork or beef? Muslims and Hindus, respectively, might also see you as being “culturally backwards” as well (if they were being narrow-minded). Why is your opinion on dogs better than, say, a Vietnamese person’s? Is it because you think you’re “better” than the Vietnamese?
My point is: keep your judgments in check if you have a limited view of the world. Your comment betrays a lack of critical thought and/or a severe drought of experiences in the world beyond the bubble you live in. 
Lastly, you didn’t need to specify any race; racism was necessarily implied in the overtone of your comment given that the OPs topic was Vietnam. 
To be clear, I don’t give a shit about your opinions on eating dogs. I do, however, take issue with you bringing up eating dogs in the context of a discussion about bitcoins. It might even be forgivable if your remark were somehow funny, witty, or original but instead, it only served to highlight what a straight-up hick you are. If that was your goal, congrats, and enjoy your downvote.

Do you have renter’s insurance? It covers the contents of your car for scenarios like this. If not, consider renter’s insurance for the future. Quite affordable (typically about $12/month). Depending on your state, you can get quick quotes via the Lemonade or Cover apps. Sorry for your loss, good luck.
