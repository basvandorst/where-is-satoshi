Those are enormous fees by your banks. Time for cryptos to take over the transfers.

You have got to be kidding yourselves. You just repeat nonsense without any real knowledge of the issue.
You could say similar things of all alt coins and even bitcoin. So why are you spreading this nonsense?

Amazing...thank you. Please let us know when you buy them back so we know when to sell. :)

The most corrupt bank in the universe (perhaps) building their own cryptocurrency to completely manipulate the same way as they do everything, including gold and silver prices. No thanks. Who the heck wants such...well fight with each other corrupt banks, I stay out of that nest of worms.

You should pretty much always do the opposite to what CNBC instructs. They are not there to help the common man, but to bring more shark food for the banks etc., i.e.  to extract money out of the public to the ones that pay their salaries and commercials.

I am pretty sure I have spent more time there than you. It is still the communist party in charge correct, even if they dont act communist other than when it suits them?

Better if they would stay out. Too much roller coaster and uncertainty with them. Any day can come any kind of news. No consistency, at least to the positive side ever. Better just kill the China market and let them continue as a communist middle earth country as they wish to be. Alone and proud.
