It's pretty unfortunate. It was my primary way of spending bitcoin. It would be great if Starbuck setup their own bitcoin direct service, but there might not be enough users to really warrant them to develop one.

This'll be great! The more places to spend bitcoin the better! I hope they have a slight discount for users paying with bitcoin.

This is truly amazing. I am consistently impressed with how bitcoin is a catalyst for all of these new technologies.

I have found that the ATMS in my area inflates bitcoins proce by about 5% when buying amd deflates by about 5% when selling. So they are making money off that inflation and the owner gets to choose the rate.

It's hard to say really. If you want to buy or sell bitcoins quickly with cash then it is pretty good. But you can get much more competitive rates online. One use case I thought of is in the case of travel, you could use these Atms as a way of exhanging currency. It would only make sense if the rate the ATM charged was better than your debit card's foreign transaction fee.
If anything, those kiosks are a way to give exposure to bitcoin and an easy way to buy and sell it.

It looks like these places use some sort of altcoin setup. This one uses shamrockcoin and [whoa, shamrock coin sounds awesome!]( It isn't open source, so we don't have to worry about it getting hacked!
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:51:15
Yeah, this whole thing screams scam. I can imagine the owners just pulling the plug on the operation once there is a large amount of these purchased coins floating around and they then just walk away with all of the cash. I can't even find an online exchange. Their FAQ also has this extremely believable tidbit.


For a laugh, google "1 USD to shamrockcoin".

With fold you directly transfer bitcoin to the app and it will give you your change back. That way you only spend what you need. I believe with gyft, your money is then locked into that gift card you bought.
I can't vouch for gyft because I haven't used it, but Fold was extremely fast when I used it. I transferred bitcoin to it while I was in line, spent it, and then received my change in a couple of seconds. All really fast.
The one thing that confused me slightly, was when I wanted to add $10 I was only asked to transfer over $8. It took me a second to realize that the 20% discount was being factored in beforehand.

LibertyX is awesome, but there are limits on how much you can deposit. You can get your bitcoin transferred to your wallet right after you enter your provided pin on their website.
Maximum of $500 worth of PINs per 24 hours (for accounts created after Feb 12)
Maximum of $1,500 in PINs in the last 7 days (for accounts created after Feb 12)

I did some more research and it looks like these "arcades" are actually [Sweepstakes parlors]( They have been around since 2005 usually fronting as internet cafes, but used to use phone cards or internet usage as a means of gambling. It seems they now have made up their own crypto currency in order to skirt around laws. 
In reality, this could not be an actual functioning crypto. It could all just be a front.

Every time I run into one it's usually out of order.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:15:58
That's awesome! Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:47:37
Thanks for the help! Also, I just noticed the new core was released. What's the easiest way to update my version?
Sorry, I am a bit new to this but I appreciate the help!

This podcast is mostly crap, the guy explaining it doesn't completely understand how bitcoin functions nor does he mention some of the really powerful things it can do. In the end the second host says, "thank you for convincing me to never buy bitcoin", other host replies "yeah it's truly a mess out there". 
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:06:50
Awesome. Thanks for the help! I'll be happy to get this node online and help support the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:07:04
Yeah it's a pi 2.0!
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:34:12
If you go through with this, don't bother waiting for the Pi to sync the blockchain on its own. It will take over a week if you're lucky and has the possibility of getting hung up multiple times.
Instead, run the bitcoin core on your actual computer and download the blockchain there. It will be much faster. I downloaded it yesterday and it took somewhere between 6-10 hours.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:39:17
Hey Xenodata, follow what and advised and download the blockchain on your laptop or desktop via bitcoin core. It is so much faster. Copy the files over to your Pi and your good to go!
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:20:03
I have been interested in running a full node for a while and this seems like an easy way to do it. Has anybody used the Bitnodes Incentive Program, and actually got paid out?
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:42:17
I installed it via command line off of github [using these instructions.]( I assume I can just delete my current version, save my blocks, and then reinstall? 
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:22:42
When explaining to somebody the true power of bitcoin, this should be one of the first videos shown. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:36:50
Hey thanks for this advice, I ran it on my desktop and it only took around 6-10 hours to sync. Loaded it up onto my Pi2 and it's up and running!
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:58:27
Any reason behind this sudden pop?
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:02:02
I would love to give your app a try. I think more information and some videos on your site will help get people to trust the system. Maybe you can have a realtime counter showing how many people have used it successfully.
My main question though is how long does it take for your payment to process at the register? I wouldn't want to be waiting too long for the payment to go through. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:56:28
It looks like they currently have plans to integrate Target and Whole foods when they first launch the app.
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:58:15
I hope Bernie accepts bitcoin if he runs. It seems right up his alley.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:16:43
Bit coin is awesome! I am just starting to figure out bitcoin and I am really impressed. Digging around the sub and this community is fantastic.
