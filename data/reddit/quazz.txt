Oh, I see, you're just a generally unpleasant person. I guess I'll stop wasting my time then.

With current computing, yes. With quantum computing, no.
Quantum computing could hack this pretty fast.

Sure, but 200 000 on a single car, never mind insurance and maintenance is a little bit more than "enjoy"
Wouldn't recommend doing this unless you actually make 200 000 every year. In which case, you wouldn't need bitcoins anyway.

And then just use a portion of it for purchases.

2050/2060 is estimated for when the population will stabilize around 10 billion

I don't use an investment on something that I can't otherwise afford to maintain or when it means I have to miss out on a great many things elsewhere.
