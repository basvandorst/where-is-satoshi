donald trump cant form a coherent sentence in response to a reporters question and he is in charge of nuclear codes. said codes are held in a briefcase that is at the mar a lago right now handcuffed to a SS agent. this upsets people.

paypal is ALREADY known for making illegal transactions of all sorts and it distancing itself from bitcoin so as to not take on more of that stigmatized affiliation. its so guilty of it itself though

right because im sure it will be promoted responsibly just like everything else they've done. i find 0 evidence to support the idea that even if they "support" bitcoin.. it will not wind up being destroyed

coinbase is blowing up and they are having trouble keeping up with customer service. it took almost 3 weeks to get a response from them and i had resolved the issue alone already. while coinbase does have a responsibility to help you, so does your bank.

This may be in part due to some recent and longstanding incompetence by other leading bitcoin sites
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:45:54
as i only intend on using bitcoin as a savings/investment account. taking the money out when i feel ive made enough is all im worried about

havnt watched mainstream media for about 7 years now. i appreciate the advice though.
can you refer me to some legitimate news sources you find useful?
@_date: 2017-02-18 09:34:14
the idea that you equate these two phrases makes me not even want to discuss things with you

not just good for the sub and reddit, but good for bitcoin

and idk how much you guys enjoy peter schiff but my opinion is hes a political hack who is indoctrinated into libertarian economics. i learned about him during the ron paul movement in 2007-2008. thanks to him i learned how batshit crazy libertarians are.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:00:57
i have no way of ever finding out about it then

when you compare it to what you can say about fiat it sounds stupid to even complain about though

can you elaborate or point me in the direction of something that will explain exactly how to do that?
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:10:31
this is genius. where did you get this from? is this something you learned or one you developed?

its no more a scam than working part time for a place like target at $10ph. As a matter of fact im making more money from genesis than my current part time retail job

i would say 80% of everyone basically has no idea what theyre talking about ... its all ignorance... i def dont lol

i plan on buying a house in july and i have over $1k split between bitcoin and ethereum... so whatever it is in july is how im going to buy a house... hopefully.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:39:13
but isnt this a bit unprecedented, making anything they have done before less of an indicator of how they will handle this?
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:10:46
what about if you planned on using ethereum?
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:39:48
bitcoin has become a lot of things it wasnt supposed to become. to me this statement is meaningless and i have no official opinion about the course of action. this is just inherently not a valid argument
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:07:14
give it an hour
@_date: 2017-03-02 08:23:43
i expect it to only get better though
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:17:24
stupid people made that mistake and still are probably making money from trading and investing. you dont have to be smart to make money when you have money
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:54:32
while i dont think the second point you make directly relates to what we are talking about.. your first point is spot on

if this community just handled this years ago the second way.. we wouldnt even need to be asking this question of how limited(pardon the pun) bitcoin is now
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:15:10
how much of that is counted as currency as opposed to being used in electronics we will never get back?

we can expect that as a possibility if the etf doesnt get approved this year. but if it does we could see bitcoin hit 500k in way less than that. digital currency is inevitable.
there are alot of parallels between cannabis prohibition and bitcoin.
they will stall it as long as they can so they can strategize how to annex the entire industry or at least harness as much as they can.
if wee see bitcoin not get their wall street legitimacy it will make room for other lesser known ones to be backed by a large financial institution and may take whatever currency that is to the forefront. bitcoin is too free at this point for them to get their hands on it to the extent they want.. it may be its downfall for being the first mainstream digital currency of the future

its a stealth version of this sub just banning people and removing posts

i know that, but lets just take the dead satellites in space and it probably accounts for a nice sum. my only point was that the total amount of mined gold isnt a very good measure for comparison

this cant be good for ethereum

it puts persppective on the idea that this is only for non-noobs. it breaks the illusion that you must be intelligent to capitalize on cryptos or investments in general. there is a typo in this article that the whole article hinges on and this person presumably is involved in the community other than writing papers and also is probably gaining some kind of income from writing as well.
SOOOOO.. i took it a bit further and used it as an example to encourage noobs to try their hand at improving their financial lives

I was expecting that answer I was just hoping that was all I was doing it for and there wasnt more to it. thanks

"try to find a way to pay the most tax possible on it"
how and why would one go about doing that?

This is much better than the other three i use. i dont want fancy. i want efficient. Ill try this one out for a while. thanks man

this is also my position. I think roger has a lot to protect but i dont hold it against him.
HOWEVER.. i think Tone vays has been REALLY inconsistent with the reasons he gives as to WHY its ok bitcoin has long waits and high fees. it sounds like really personal justifications he molds into logical reasoning for the greater good.
hes a great analyst and i take his opinion more seriously than most... but personally i think hes very full of something.. whether its himself or shit idk but we will find out one day and i hope im on the right side of it.

well that was the last one i did. i kept dumping it but it kept proving me wrong. i actually had my biggest day since ive been on poloniex all due to ripple. increased my trading budget total by 50%

did they though? i mean as was stated before "considering where we are"

bitcoin and capitalism arent even comparable. bitcoin can be a tool of any economy. i hate this affiliation people keep trying claim it has with capitalism. get out of ur wet dream. capitalism will go the way of most everything created in that time period. replaced with something much better.
