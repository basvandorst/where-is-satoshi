Because one is extremely volatile and the other isn't? One is a widely accepted currency almost anywhere and the world and the other isn't?

You mean the tech that remained largely the same throughout all 2017 despite yielding 2000% growth? I could comfort you with tales on LN but its implementation has been complete shit.

If you bought your first BTC ever and you waited 36 days even to get you account approved exactly what data points do you have to claim they are better than Coinbase? You don't seem to have any experience at all with Coinbase and it seems you had a pretty shitty experience with Gemini assuming you value your time whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:53:30
I hope so. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:19:08
Considering the massive price fluctuations present in BTC that aren't present in DKR there would certainly be some differences. Also, transaction times.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:14
There has been regulatory uncertainty around bitcoin for years now. The average buyer doesn't even know there is a SEC hearing in a few days. Also if a single SEC meeting could "make or break" the bitcoin market I would bitcoin is a terrible investment.

Funny how it goes up after Tether injects 72 million EUR₮ into the market right?

The people who spent considerably more than $7000 for their coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:29:14
Bitcoin never even touched $5000 until 6 months ago. It rose to 20k quickly after that. For well over 90% of its lifetime bitcoin traded at $1000 or lower so I don't know why people expect these recent highs to be maintained. This isn't the bottom.

it doesn't have to go up forever it can stop at the moon

you realize your comment isn't even remotely related to nor does it negate the fact I posted right? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:23:21
the point he is making is that your are gambling. you could win or you could lose and right now you are losing. if you aren't comfortable with the prospect that your gamble may result in a loss rather than a win don't purchase in the first place.

The banks stopped allowing the use of CC's due the to the crash in price. They didn't cause it. It is a smart business decision for them not to allow the purchase of crypto on credit. They all still allow the use of a debit card linked to real money. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:17:12
If it never came close to touching 7000 until the past few months and the currency is like ~8 years old than $7000 is not historically cheap whatsoever. The fundamentals are no different than when bitcoin was hanging on around $1000 for much much longer. No reason to believe $7000 is cheap or close to the floor
Care to elaborate on your "its cheap" comment and explain why you believe that?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:32


Bitcoin could completely collapse/disappear tomorrow and we would still have access to cryptocurrencies that are arguably better. That is why I have always viewed this as a bubble even if you believe in crypto their is nothing special about bitcoin besides being first. It certainly isn't the best. This is coming from someone who actually used BTC as a currency and not a store of value. No HODLing for me which meant no gains for me but never any losses either.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:58:10
So? I fail to see the logic in your statement. Bitcoin is less useful now as a currency than it was at 1k due to shitty transactions times and transaction fees. There may be more people in crypto but they are simply trading it and manipulating the market or HODLing they aren't buying things with it for the most part. Not to mention their are countless altcoins that are just as useful if not more useful than bitcoin for people who actually want to  use it as a currency and not a get rich quick scheme. The only thing BTC has going for it is being first and having the most name recognition. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:03:40
What a solid argument you just made in favor of BTC! I'm convinced now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:14:12


You  could make that same comment if it falls to 6k and 5k or $200. That isn't really analysis. Also what about the second question?  Why should the price go up?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:28:46


My point was the while it *can* shoot up again there is every chance that it does not. 


[tell that to this guy](
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:11:05
Why would this lead to altcoins being wiped out? What advantage does bitcoin have outside being the most well known coin and the first coin?
This is the exact reason I've thought bitcoin was overpriced well before it got to 10k. New coins are created everyday and some are better than bitcoin. So why should bitcoin be worth so much more than the alts? And why would this crash lead to killing alts? People were running alts before crypto blew up just for the fun it. Dogecoin etc.... By now we have reached a point where anyone of slightly above average knowledge of computers can make their own coin. Altcoins aren't going anywhere although I understand why someone invested in BTC would want them to disappear. Monopolies are nice...

Economics isn't a hard science which relies on objective data. It is more guesswork than anything. Different people are going to have different opinions.


If your technology can be tanked by a mean news article it wasn't worth anything in the first place.

Chargebacks or simply unable to pay the money they owe. Bank gets fucked either way.

They are supposedly designing mining only cards without all the additional output ports of the back to make them a bit cheaper and separate miner cards from gamer cards. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:32:22


Except maybe the county where the majority of miners are already located. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:14:28


No, the scammer didn't make them do anything. Your friend isn't smart.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:14:57
Luckily I have absolutely no reason to believe BTC will ever come close to touching a million. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:03:44
The cards I'm referring to haven't been released yet I just read they were under development a few days ago. I assume they would at least have to have one single output but obviously no need for HDMI and 3 Displayport. I didn't realize MSI already offered something similar. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:33:44
Yep this is pretty straightforward. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:12
Who cares what bitcoin was about it the early days? Things evolve. Not to mention their is no objective agreement on what bitcoin was ever originally about in the first place and I've read the original whitepaper. To some it has always been a gamechanger and to some it has always been nothing more than something resembling a ponzi scheme and only used legitimately among criminals via good old fashioned drug dealing or for financial crimes/money laundering. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:07:36
"huge upswing"
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:38:21
If your strongest argument for bitcoin is arguing against fiat that isn't saying to much. While our monetary system might not be "fine" it is certainly functional and doesn't seem likely to fall apart anytime soon. In fact it is doing quite well right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:24:04




Good question not asked nearly enough and I've yet to see a good answer. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:52:06
You can tax BTC without banning it.

[I was looking at this Gigabyte model](








@_date: 2018-02-07 17:41:43
Agreed. Unless you have a solid understanding of the underlying code you only "understand the tech" in the loosest sense of the word. *I have a general idea of how bitcoin functions* is a more honest statement for the vast majority of people here. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:20:30
We literally sent people to the moon once as a country and never went back.

Yeah, it was the P104-100. Only 3 months warranty on them too.

A few weeks ago to send $5 in bitcoin you would have to spend ~$40 in transaction fees.

bloody assholes predict rising bitcoin? I have been throwing all my money into bloody stool futures!

Worse than that although I don't have a timeline for my prediction.

If you get paid in BTC and only spend BTC literally every one of your purchase in life is going to be recorded in the blockchain forever. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:53:37
This is my guess. Probably anyone including a crypto deposit address is getting banned.

The fact that bitcoin is worth a third of its ATH is what the public cares about.

Holding up LN as a success story shows that your optimism is boundless. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:44:15
There were plenty of us saying it was an artificial pump at the time and you simply chose to ignore us. The market manipulation has become so obvious you have to be blind not to see it. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:40:07
Bitcoin functioned perfectly well for 8 years rarely even touching $1000. "Believing in bitcoin" doesn't require it touching $10,000 ever again. The past year has given many of you massively unrealistic expectations. Bitcoin never even touched $5000 for the first time until a bit over 6 months ago. Those of us who have actually been involved in bitcoin for more than a couple years we understand these prices are far from the traditional norm and are not required for bitcoin to be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:19:07


Good luck with that. I like how they implement this *after* they have been selling coins to the criminal element for years. They know their cash cow is dying anyway so a little bit more regulation won't hurt at this point. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:25:41
Yes Twitter is a publicly traded company but I assume he meant they are private sector company and can do whatever they want with accounts which is completely true.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:47:10
That is assuming there is actually new money coming into the market and not just a bunch of bots ran by exchanges and whales gaming to the system to make money on both the upswing and downswing.
