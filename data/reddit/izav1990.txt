I don’t necessarily agree that it’s a waste of space. General sentiment analysis can also be a strong marker, and I’m sharing a positive sentiment. While you might think of my post as a waste of space someone else might have a different perspective. Each to their own.

It’s more that instead of selling I bought as it was going down, with the mindset that if it goes down further I’ll buy again. A stark contrast from my previous mindset which was sell sell sell as soon as the price goes down.

Thanks so much. I was hoping you could look into my tx id for me?: b513c695d2bd38e2ff0a83e768463deb0e8da228ff8ae64e1186b9b3721e8cac 
14 days is an insane time to wait. Is there anyway I could speed up the process now?

Ahhh thanks anyway, I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that a miner has pity on me and decides to confirm my block!

Hello! Sorry for being a noob. I sent 0.1 bitcoin this morning to binance from cex.io. On the CEX.IO side I got a confirmation email, however there is nothing on Binance and when I go into it (nothing on my history), it says that my transaction is unconfirmed, when I go through the link via CEX.IO. Could anyone put my mind at ease? Is there anyway of knowing if the BTC will ever arrive in my Binance account? I'm slightly freaking out. All the times I've sent money over in the last week, it only took 10-15 minutes to see the money in Binance, so I don't know what I did differently today. Any help, would be very much appreciated! Thanks!!

What phone number was trying to call you? Just so I can double check that that’s not the same person trying to call me...

Is it your first time entering the Bitcoin market? If so, welcome! Hopefully you’ve entered because you’ve been researching for a while and timing your entry so that you can make a long term investment, rather than attempting to day trade. 
I really don’t mind seeing these posts here because it’s a great marker for sentiment. We should be nurturing new comers and sharing our knowledge rather than berating them for making a post.

I disagree. I think you are negating what Bitcoin could be if it didn’t just focus on product-market fit but also looked at broader branding concepts and focussed on the customer journey. As a consumer, there’s so much misinformation, so many scams, cowboys, and distrust currently around this space, that it’s currently just the early adopters that have invested into bitcoin. I believe that with better marketing, and experiences at each of the touch points along the customer journey, we’d be looking at a much higher market value for Bitcoin and a greater rate of market penetration and adoption.
