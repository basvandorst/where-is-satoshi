This time is different and bitcoin may be indeed dead (security flaw, bad hard fork) by the time people forget.
Because people lost too much hard earned real money already in this shit to pump and dumper crooks, to scammers, to thieves, to defrauding exchanges, to dumping miners, to the whole multi million dollar fee sucking con bitcoin infrastructure.
Many think Wall Street will save us, it is bullshit. Wall Street only risks its own money if the general public jumps in and they can ride them like a cheap whore.
General public will not touch this shit for at least a year more. People need to forget the horror last year, which looks like tulip mania.
Even at 100 to upkeep the whole frikin "bitcoin economy" you need hundreds of millions of dollars. Not to mention those millions of bitcoins liing around, that will be dumped cos of shattered dreams of the holders that they can become rich without working.

You must be one of those tin foil hat weirdos who like when their investment value falls 10% a day. I will laugh my ass off when you finally sell at 50 USD what this shit worth by fundamentals.
