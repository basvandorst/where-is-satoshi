The Swedish Krona is stronger than the norwegian at the moment I think. They are really close though.

I suppose, I am more of a constitutionalist (and the country I live in don't even have that strong a constitution) since I believe more strongly in a more or less constant system of law so that people with wealth can't redesign the system to suit their gains and so that the poor can't use the system to redistribute wealth.

It used to be a political stance but has transformed into a financial/welfare stance. If you would say that Sweden is a third world country noone would agree. However if you use the original definition it is.

Don't know why people are downvoting you but I upvoted to counter. 
I think we might have a similar crash in the near future due to things like a 0% REPO-rate (in Sweden at least). Causing people to be able to take loans they can't really afford, driving up the price of housing while increasing the risk that banks take when they loan money to people. This bubble will burst when people can't pay the loans they have taken, houses will drop rapidly in price and people will default on their loans.

It is a bit redundant to use it that way though. There hardly exists any second world countries anymore.

No it isnt, stop calling all bad things in the world capitalism. Capitalism has its faults sure but to say that the reason certain places in Africa is in poverty is because of capitalism is not only wrong. It is ignorant.

What is it exactly that I don't understand? 
That global markets have lifted far more people out of poverty than any egalitarian means? 
That the extreme poverty in other parts of the world is anything other than relative?
That the guy with 4G that can't afford to feed his family without biking for days would be in the exact same situation but without 4G (and possibly without a job) in a world without capitalism?
That urbanisation and devolution of agarian societies is a part of the growing populations that stem from a decrease in child mortality due to improvements in medical technology and that free market systems actually help decrease the demographic problem?
But yeah you are right. Sustenance farming and having half your children die from trivial diseases and your wife die from childbirth is way preferable to "living under the evil capitalist system". Industrialisation requires a system of distribution of resources. You can either do it with market economy or by planned. Market economies tend to be freer and support individual performance to a greater degree and that is the main reason why I prefer capitalism to anything else that have been tried. It is not perfect but it is way less "evil" than any kind of socialism that I have read about.

They didn't have a "unregulated free market" prior to the great depression no matter what Keynesians tell you. The federal reserve was established 1913. What did they do before '29 if not regulate the supply of money? Sit on their hands and wait for a crisis so that they could swoop in and save everyone? 
I would argue that the violent cycles in the american economy by the turn of the 20th century was due to easy credits issued by the government in order to boost a slow economy.
I am economist but the competing banks of the 19th century is in my opinion a better solution to large scale crisis than big government regulation.

Since the dawn of man is really not that long as every galaxy was born in less time then it takes to sing this song. A fraction of a second and the elements were made, the bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate. They tried to leap (leave?) but the were late and they all died. "They froze their asses off".

He did a bad choice in that case. 
Maybe he had been told his whole life that his cookie would be safe with the bank. Even during school. 
I would say that depending on the contract the homeless person either got screwed and could sue or did a bad investment. In one of the cases the banker is at fault. In the other the homeless person is. 
You are however making it sound like the banker is the bad guy when it just as easily could be that the homeless guy is just bad at handling his cookies.
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:38:37
Why would the homeless person choose to secure his possesion with the banker? Why did you call him wise for doing it?

A random person comes to my house and says that he will take my cookies and double them for a fee. If I give him all of my cookies am I not partly at fault?
He is the one making the crime but I am the one responsible for my cookies. And his crime is just a contract away from being legal. 
If I sign a stupid contract, I am the one at fault if it bites me in the ass. The law should not be there to protect stupid people from themselves.

The point is that you are mocking him, that does not make you sound collected and ready to talk about such matters. It only adds another layer of hostility, you will never convince anyone to change their opinion with that attitude.

That is a known financial tactic called Arbitrage. I think the problem with it currently is that it is kind of hard to get money out of China. The same problem exists when trying to use the differances between say Mtgox and Bitstamp, since it is so hard to move dollars out of gox

Not really sure, I do think taxation is theft but it works okay so I think it is okay. A little bit like, the ends justify the means. I do not like the concept that more and more power is taken out of the hands of the people and politics today are far from what they should be. I can't really place myself though.

Okay, if he is a troll commentator then responding to him will only feed the troll and if he isn't you are just destroying any possibility of changing his views. In any way you are not contributing anything by "counter-trolling" and you are just as bad as the original troll.

I am pretty much the same I put in 5000 SEK (about 770$) today for the first time. Since this is money I can afford to lose I am not that afraid of any potential crashes or the like.

I think you could apply the formula to bitcoin aswell. The reason bitcoin hasn't been adopted yet is because the ratio between how good it is and how hard it is to adopt is to low.
