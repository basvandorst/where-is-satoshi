And a cat named Monacoin
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:31:36
That’s a shark
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:00:29
More like check in the middle of the night and then can’t go back to sleep
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:22:17
Ditto. Doing the same for my office mate. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:35:49
Like inflation
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:54:56
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:59:32
More like to the minute. My husband built a dashboard for me that updates every minute so I don’t have to calculate by hand. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:38
Woke up at 5am to go bathroom. Then I checked the price...now eyes wide open 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:59:20
Thanks so much, that does make a lot of sense!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:53:32
May the HODL with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:49:56
Can someone please ELI5 how to set up and use lightening network for “coffee buying”?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:03:20
Once someone said bitcoin is a financial revolution dressed up as get rich fast proposition. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:24:22
I’m in the process of transferring all my coins off of Coinbase, store in wallet, and from now Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:45:58
So what’s the name today?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:00:27
No thanks :-)
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:28:02
I’ve always wondered with all the technology advancements changing our lives and society, why are we still using good old cash?! This is the answer to my question. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:58:48
Over what time frame?
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:39:17
Darn then I missed out while sleeping...
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:00:42
Anyone knows what happened to btc price on Coinbase overnight? Got a bunch of alerts saying it went below $5k, but it’s still above $6k when I just checked. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:27:31
Hope it happens soon so we can buy
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:29:24
Do it PBoC, so we can buy some BTC on the cheap. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:25:58
I wish it would go down to $500, then I'd buy as many as I can afford to and hodl 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:44:13
We should only be so lucky to see a crash. Then it's time to stock up. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:43:00
So what ended up happening?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:34:48
Thanks!! 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:38:03
Thanks Rosie, I'm all set for now since I bought back in at a lower price, but I will keep this in mind for the future. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:04:24
Yes I actually can:
I'd love to hear as a Chinese citizen, how you can move $1M from China to the US. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:08:14
Thanks so much!!
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:35:56
Via Coinbase? I was just charged $5 for a $10 transaction!! And my friend only got $5 of it. Something is going wrong with COINBASE. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:35:28
That article talks about restrictions on the capital outflow, which applies to companies and individuals. For most people there, it's going to be a lot harder to make that happen than to simply buy and move bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:41:33
So if you send via Coinbase, do you also get to set the fee manually?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:00:03
Things sometimes work out in mysterious ways :-) my order was set to $972, and now it's below $900, so it worked out 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:51:35
Then $5 fee on a $10 transaction is highway robbery!!
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:19:29
Bitcoin is about the main way to move massive capital out of china right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:02:53
Same thing just happened to me about 30 min ago when I transferred $10 to a friend. It charged me $5 for fee!!
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:02:31
My son is 6, and has been putting his allowances in bitcoin since 5. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:35
17 days from 7000 to 8000, including a big correction down to 5500 on the way. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:29
Hubby got us started, I got us to HODL since 2015. Got my dad, mom, a team member, office mate, boss, boss’s boss to buy bitcoins! 4 females and 4 males, 50/50 gender ratio
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:01:39
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:41
I was in the middle of panic buy, and GDAX went offline. NOT COOL!
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:51:09
So well said. I saved the comment to help educate my fellow bitcoiners. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:05:22
Totally agreed. Marketing can be expensive but there are free and viral ways to do it. Sharing educational BTC articles on LinkedIn, get your highly connected friends to like and share your articles go a long way. Grass root approach friends!! I️ once posted on LinkedIn a Coursera class on BTC, in 2 days got 500+ views. Imagine we all do that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:42:29
Feeling the same. Giving away BTC to get people addicted. So far 4 for 5. Making 15 ish BTC paper wallets for Xmas gifts
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:37:53
Same experience here. It’s been a game of “trying to get back to where I started” game. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:02:39
Where do you check such stats?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:19
GDAX! It was briefly up, I worked as fast as I could to put in a bunch of buy orders at equal price intervals. Snuck in some buy orders. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:46:13
Gave my dad 0.25 BTC ($100) as bday gift back in 2015... he’s very happy now. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:36:19
I see the same results 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:00:49
What about moms?
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:45:22
Do I need to do anything if my BTCs are in a keep key wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:25:09
What I don't understand about replay attack is that don't the attackers need my private key to complete the transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:45:21
Thank you!!
