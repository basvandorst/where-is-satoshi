They just explained on [the Tor mailing list]( why they added a signed certificate to the onion:


being ssl stripped, so the chances of getting them into a usage
pattern of checking a 16 character onion address felt slim -
especially when clones can match the first 10 characters and there is
no browser failure mode for not checking the address

Funny i'm always hearing the same thing about bitcoin.

Tor hidden services can also run as relays but it is advised not to since relays publish info about themselves such as uptime, bandwidth, etc. which can lead to correlation attacks.
In terms of progress in security development Tor is a lot further ahead than i2p. In most recent issues i2p had a vulnerability in its code, while Tor is dealing with issues that are generalized research issues such as timing and correlation attacks.
The Tor network is also a lot larger than the i2p network, which means it is safer since it is more difficult to control more nodes and your traffic is obfuscated amongst larger volumes of other traffic.

That is an accurate summary of how one of the attacks work.

Bitcoin addresses are 160 bit while Tor onion addresses are 80 bit, that means Tor is 16 characters at base32, case insensitive, while bitcoin addresses are 32+ characters in base58, case sensitive
This means Tor addresses if vanity generated can be memorable, while Bitcoin addresses - vanity generated or not, can not be memorable and never will be.
Memorable Tor addresses is a *good thing* that prevents phishing. With random addresses users just end up copy+pasting them and ignoring the actual content.
It would be good if OP actually posted *why* he felt vanity Tor hostnames make phishing easier rather than just leaving it as a statement - I thought me might be talking about Bitcoin addresses but that also makes no sense.

Torrents use UDP which Tor doesn't support, it is by design - because you can't rewrite the UDP packets and they'll lead to the user being deanonymized. A low latency onion routing network is not the use case for anonymizing Torrent usage.
I2P has nowhere near as many relays, Tor is at 6k+ relays, 4k+ bridges and 1k+ exits. I2P could have 10x more users than Tor and it wouldn't matter, since the DHT only exposes 20, 30 or 40 nodes to the user at a time - which is what makes i2p more vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Tor users can build circuits using any of the available 6k relays.
i2p's strength with eepsites is with those hosting the sites - in that case it is *much* better than hidden sites - but the difference for users is different. This is why i2p has been met with little adoption despite hosts eagerly wanting to adopt it to host their sites with.
I don't know why i2p comes up every time Tor is mentioned - it makes no sense. OP's original point about relays makes no sense. My impression from this and other threads is that most of the i2p advocacy is based on misinformation. 
To give you an idea of where the projects are in respect to one another: 3 months ago i2p had a bug in the implementation that allowed remote exec. It was the first time Tails was hit with 0day and was exploited to deanonymize users. This is the type of bug you find in poor software or in alpha software - not in production software and certainly not in security software. i2p is *still in development*.
Tor, on the other hand, is dealing with attack types at a level that require solutions that address core problems in computer science and research - such as graph based and correlation/timing attacks. 
I don't dislike i2p, I use it all the time and follow the project closely and can see how it would eventually fit into the ecosystem - but this constant mention of i2p as a saving grace to Tor is completely baffling to anybody familiar with both projects.
