Hold both. I like physical gold, silver ,palladium, platinum, afa graded 12 back star wars toys, bitcoin ...I like rare things 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:34:29
Some will hold no matter where the price goes  because they look at bitcoin as a revolution in money. Most people are  just speculating. I do wonder how many people are going to lose important savings if this tanks due to these Hodl recommendations. Hopefully people are smart enough to effectively manage their money and not be influence by the internet.

do you have debt? Do you an emergency fund of 3-6 months in an accessible safe savings? Do you have your Roth IRAs maxed? Do you have kid that will someday need college funds? Are you diversified in your investments? If you have your ducks in line I would say hold or even add to you positions in Ether/BTC, if not sell and take care of items listed first. Just my honest Opinion,

I don’t understand the pissing match between gold and bitcoin they are two very separate entities. Yes anything that has value is based on human perception. The reason gold is valuable (although I believe silver is even better) are a few reasons; it’s chemical make up. It does not corrode so time is on its side . Coins found today that are thousands of years old are easily recognizable. And while it is used in industry in many application I believe it’s value is more based on its rarity and it’s timeless history of being money. It also carries no counterparty risk if you hold physical and it can help one build legacy wealth. People have valued gold for over 3000 years and no matter the political climate the social climate or the financial climate gold has tested them all. So while I agree that it’s not a good use for currency in this age it still has a place. That’s why I own both along with ag. And while I check my crypto gambling’s .. uh I mean portfolio every hour. I don’t worry about my precious metals worth because to me they are money. And while they may go up and down compared to fiat (us$ etc)if you truly understand gold you realize that gold is the measuring stick. It’s the stable one it’s value remains nearly unchanged against any currency. You won’t get Rich owning gold but you’ll sleep well knowing your wealth is protected. There is a great video on YouTube by a gentleman named belangp called “understanding gold.”It’s a great watch if have ~20 minutes to burn.

There is a large dip coming to a theatre near you soon.. no doubt. Lot a money on the sidelines waiting in the wind though.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:17:28
Wouldn’t it be cool if crypto was the currency we were measuring the price in and not comparing it always to the US dollar/ euro etc..That will be a day when the technology truly has met its intended use. Until then it will trade like a commodity. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:04:41
This is why you don't buy it - it hasn't evolved it was intended as a currency. It's all wild speculation now. Gold remains a true store of value and has been since around 700BC. It offers great piece of mind and legacy wealth. My bitcoin feels like gambling and I hope someday it will worth more that it does today. My gold, on the other hand,  I know will be worth something always and while it may not make me rich it it brings me comfort knowing it's there.

In the movie E.T. in the scene where Elliot and E.T. Separate and Elliot gets better and E.T. "Dies" .we all cry .....Well I'm Kinda waiting for that to happen with an alt coin right now... Of Course if E.T. is Bitcoin and Elliott is say Litecoin. Litecoin will take on a life of its own for a short while.......until.. all of the experts and non family leave the room ...then the iced down vacuum sealed Bitcoin's heart will glow ..but only the true believers will see it ..and by the time all the people who left poor bitcoin try to catch E.T. he will be flying right in front of the moon and eventually he be shooting off in to space with a fucking rainbow vapor trail.

my mother in law asked me about bitcoin at Christmas. a few years ago i was going on and on about what bitcoin was going to become and how awesome it was going to be as a new currency. they shunned me and called it a scam. now they want help buying it, but it is not what i thought it would be.

Ask them what is backing the dollar? It's printed by a private bank and its back by nothing but the faith of the people and our government.  Fiat Paper is currency not Money the only true Money are silver and gold. Bitcoin is trying to Bridge that , but BTC was designed as a decentralized currency not Money even though that's what it appears to be becoming. Gold and silver have history on their side to maintain that hedge against fiat and  a test time store of value.. but we are in uncharted waters with cryptos. I think its best to hold both.

I read so many ways everyday on here how you can easily lose your money. When I talk to my family about Bitcoin I picture my grandmother for even my Mother trying to use it and understand how to transfer or set up a secure wallet. They would screw up so quick. Managing bitcoin it's just to easy for common folk to screw up and lose money.

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:03
That's what Btc has evolved into but not what the intent was. problem with digital gold is that it doesn't have the history of a store of value like the real metal. Maybe a new history is being written now but I'm skeptical about sustainability. I'll buy both for now.

I tried to teach my grandmother about bitcoin yesterday. It is very difficult to explain.

I don't understand the gold bashing on this sub. Seems to me they are not really in any competition. I have both I see my BTC almost like my Checking account and Gold Silver Platinum and Palladium as my savings. I guess thats why they call it Personal Finance. Honestly the biggest turn off I see to bit coin are the attitudes surrounding it. If you want increased adoption you have to teach not belittle. Gold has such a long history of being money and a store of value. BTC has a lot of potential but its a baby.

The pumping of bitcoin on reddit is starting to remind me of a yahoo finance forum for a penny stock. The failure that is becoming apparent is the creditability of bitcoin as a sound currency. I'm in the game but it feels more like roulette than a solid financial platform. I Hope one  day bitcoin gets her footing and doesn't fall off the cliff because we didn't  help her balance. Greed may be her death.

Seems to me all fiat currency is a ponzi scheme. I like gold and silver as a store of value, but its difficult to use and the intrinsic value for many makes it difficult to spend. Bitcoin is similar to gold and silver in all the good ways as currency, and the icing on the cake is the future "lowered" intrinsic value. (on Par with most fiats). When I squint my eyes and peer into in the future I see myself using gold and silver (as well as some Palladium and Platinum) as my long term savings account and bitcoin as my checking..oh wait the future is here :)

You guys seem to be all shorts-narrow minded fools, What attracted me to bitcoin was the amazing idea and math- almost revolutionary, I pictured all those people protesting not that long ago on wall street actually when someone first explained it to me. I thought oh!Shit! there is hope!. A real change. but no this is just another fucking volatile penny stock that people are buying and selling with other fiat. Listen! those that are gambling huge amounts should take a step back and look at the picture. You there sitting in front of this screen -stomach queazy - with your finger on the sell button- you are in toooo deep. Im out for now, my hope lies with stabilization, the get rich quick themes are killing this amazing idea. If Satoshi subscribed to this subreddit he would sell. good luck and get out, for now- mark these words.

You have to decide for your self what to do.
