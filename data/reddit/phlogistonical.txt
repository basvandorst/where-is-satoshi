If you are a traders that believes that the price of BTC and most alts is artificially inflated because it has been driven up with fake tethers, you are going to bet on BTC/USD going down now. So sell now, and perhaps buy back sometime in the future when people feel we've re-established what the 'real' BTC/USD is.

Bitcoin once went from $17 to $0.01 in minutes. This is nowhere even close to 'uncharted waters'.
Anything less than a 50% loss is just another day at the office. In this case, it was well anticipated and I don't believe we're done. My buy orders are quite a ways done from here.

It's still excellent advice.
Today's situation is not "blood in the streets" though. Even though we went down 50%, there is still way too much positive sentiment. We still get 25k-50k predictions, memes and 'buying the dip' comments. Only when you are really beginning to doubt whether it was wise to buy/hodl and all hope for bitcoin seems lost THEN is it time to buy.

It IS circular logic. Traders buy because an asset because they think it will increase in value, and if many traders share their belief, they collectively buy and it actually will increase in value.
It has the effect of amplifying movements, especially if they were expected to some extent. Markets often overreact to news for this reason.

'a crash' or not... it is just semantics. Whatever you want to call it, it has happened countless times before. Anything less than -50% is business as usual and not worth discussing at length. Price went up dramatically in the past few months. A 'crash' or 'popping a bubble' like this was well anticipated, and I don't think we're done. My buy orders are quite a bit further down.

That would be a good start. Then followed by many months of no news and slow downwards movement. People will try to pump good news, but it has no effect.

They very likely do so already, but a combination of (i) rapid growth of the number of users that (ii) all want to login and trade simultaneously during periods of high volatility and (iii) well-timed DDoS attacks is not easy to deal with.

It happened on the 19th of june 2011.
However, this drop was not the result of normal trading. IIRC an attacker managed to access an account with a large number of coins and sold out nearly the entire order book.

I am required to submit my bitcoin balance at the 1st of jan every year.
Government samples and checks tax submissions. They can check a balance on exchanges that properly implemented AML/KYC. I believe that they can also require me to prove that any money that I have has come from legal operations.

You are totally missing the point. It does not matter how bitcoin is encoded or represented. Regular money usually also consists of simple pieces of paper and little round chunks of metal.

Indeed. And if there is no consensus, ie some nodes agree, but others don't, that's when you get a fork.
To continu with your example: some nodes and miners may stick to the plan and reduce the block rewards to 6.25 BTC at the agreed moment, but you could in theory have another group of nodes and miners that continue with 12.5 BTC rewards. That's fine, but you would not be able to spend those BTC on the other chain (the '6.25 BTC block reward chain'). In effect, you will from then on have two variants of bitcoin.

Even if it was a proper cryptocoin, it still woudn't add anything. It'd just be another worthless altcoin. We already have coins for payments. It makes no sense to have separate currencies to pay for food, newspaper articles, data, goods, etc. Just one is enough, and we already have that.
The only thing that would be different from trustless crypto's is that this one would be 'backed' by a company (which requires you to trust the company backing it. And in this particular case it is a company that does not have a great track record to gain our trust).
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:40:00
In the short term, yes, that would do some damage, but it won't be the end. The bug can be fixed, and bitcoin continues and it'll be stronger than it was before.
In the early days, there have been bugs, some of them pretty bad. They were fixed, and bitcoin continued. The stakes are just a lot higher now.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:34:40
Yes, a single node can fork bitcoin. Well, there'd also need to be at least one miner (but that could be run on the same computer):
eg, you could write an modified version of bitcoin that accepts blocks with 1000 BTC blockrewards,  and run it on your own node. Then also run a miner that mines blocks for it, and there you go. Your own personal fork of bitcoin. If you can convince others to run your version of bitcoin, it can grow.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:32:24
If you decide to sell at the wrong time you risk buying back in at a higher price.
It is not easy to time the market. It is easier to just hold and buy more during dips.
Trusting that BTC will eventually go up to higher levels, even during dramatic 'crashes', will allow you to sleep well, not constantly having to watch the price.

Because when it was at 19, you did not yet know that was going to be the peak, so why sell?
When you find out it is actually descending, so does everyone else. It may therefore already be at the bottom as people start buying the dip. Or it could drop further... Why buy at 11, 12 or 13? It could be 7 tomorrow.
All traders try this. Clearly there are opportunities to make very interesting profits in times of extreme volatility like this, but in reality it really is rather difficult to pull off perfectly like that.
Ofcourse, some people will have guessed it right and brag about it. For every one of them, there will be lots of people that made the wrong call and you usually don't hear them, but they must be there. Every coin sold is bought by someone. Someone bought at 19k. Someone sold at 11k.

If bitcoin replaces fiat, the satoshi (being the smallest quantum of bitcoin), should be approximately equivalent to the smallest quantum of fiat. So, in terms of USD, 1 satoshi = 1 penny. Then 0.016 BTC would be about $16000.

No. At least here in the Netherlands, the Euro was forced down our throat by our politicians. The majority of people felt strongly that the Euro was not in our favour, and politicians completely failed to explain the benefits they claimed it would have (confirming to many that there were none).
Lending money to Greece was uncomfortable to most people, but our minister of finance at the time happily claimed we'd make a nice profit out of the deal.
In hindsight, it is incredible how our politicians blindly followed the EU and accepted the poorly-thought out financial structure to become such a risk to our own financial position.

I believe I understand your perspective, but fear it is simply human nature to do this. A person rates his level of happiness relative to his experiences. Put the billionaire in a mud hut for a while and he'll change his judgement of what constitutes happiness. Humans always have a limited view of the world and limited range of experiences to which they can relate things.
However, the person living in the mud hut is never given a choice to *decide* what makes them happy. They will have to take what life offers them.
Nearly everyone here in the west has food, shelter and relative safety. I can't help but feel I was lucky to be born here and have all that without even trying whereas the folks living on a garbage belt in Brazil can barely survive. They have never been given any options to do otherwise. They never *decided* to be happy that way. I don't think it is necessarily bad to think it might help folks on the garbage belt if they are offered alternatives to their way of life.

@_date: 2018-05-04 22:42:43
I didn't think that one was so bad. It only took to october the same year to begin the next rally, i.e. 6 months. The next 'crash'/downtrend lasted a lot longer \(dec 2013 \- oct 2015, or 22 months\).
Also, after the previous rally to $32 in 2011 and subsequent drop to $2\-something \(which also took much longer\), many thought there'd never be another opportunity like that and the 2013 was really good in that respect. It showed that bitcoin was here to stay and we'd probably have these rally's again and again. The crash was only because MtGox and other exchanges could not handle the insane increase in volume, that was certainly something that could and would be solved in time. No fundamental problem with bitcoin itself.
The sentiment now feels very similar to 2013 to me. There is no 'blood in the streets' at all, I'd say most feel the current/recent 'crash' was just a cool\-off period that was necessary after the insane rally and we are all ready for the next stage.

Our kids will never understand the following joke, as they will live in the bitcoin era:
A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. After having the beer, he asks the bartender for the bill. "$3", says the bartender.
The man just for fun goes on and places $1 coin on the three ends of the table. The bartender gives him a bad look but has no other option but to pick them up.
This happened for 3-4 days and everyday the bartender felt humiliated.
Next time, he orders a beer but couldn't find three $1 coins to pay the bill. So, he hands the bartender a $5 note. Now, the bartender gets all excited and thinks that it is his day to avenge the hard time he had because of this man. He then places the two $1 coins at the opposite ends of the table.
Now, with a shrewd smile and with all the excitement he goes to the man and says, "Go on, collect your change".
The man then takes out a $1 coin from his pocket and puts it in front of the bartender and says, "One more beer please."

This is not a third world country. The Greek have grown accustomed to a very high standard of living, on par with that of the rest of Europe and the US and they are not content to go back to the stone age, that much is clear. I fully understand they keep ~~begging for~~ demanding more money.
What I do not get is that it is apparently unclear to Greece that they simply cannot continue to spend more than they earn.

Having been involved in the bitcoin-24 problems earlier this year, I can tell you it might be opposite to what you expect when the shit hits the fan.
Banks/Governments/Liquidators can easily block accounts holding USD and there we would have to go through lengthy legal procedures to try to get back what we own.
BTC is much less regulated at this point, and in the case of bitcoin-24, anyone holding BTC was returned their property much faster than anyone holding fiat (which is still going on).

2) Gox let the problem grow to epic proportions before making any public statement, to the point where a lot of people were led to assume they had become insolvent. Bitstamp announced their action immediately and explained it well.
3) Gox lied about the root of the problem and the role of the core dev team. Bitstamp explains the issue clearly and (as far as I can tell) honestly.
4) Their actions and announcements strongly suggest they are just manipulating the price to benefit themselves. Their fees are the highest of any exchange, they formulated their most recent announcement to maximally aggrevate the problem ("there is a bug in the bitcoin protocol!").

Ofcourse gold has value, I will readily admit that. 
3. yes, I refined some gold from e-scrap, and disliked hiding it. It'll never be 100% secure. I really like that I can store encrypted BTC wallets in plain sight without worrying that my BTC gets stolen when someone breaks into my house while retaining access to them in minutes.
4. Perhaps in the US, but here (the Netherlands) stores will not accept gold, except perhaps jewelers (and ofcourse metal traders).
5. It would be a tremenous coincidence if the amount you need to pay exactly equals the value of a piece of that bar. You'll need to saw, file or melt to get the exact amount. With metal, having pieces pre-made with different values (ie coins; your nickles and dimes, our 'dubbeltjes' and 'kwartjes') is the only solution. Bitcoin is more convenient.
6. Yes, really. One less thing in my pockets. I hate a thick wallet, bulky keychains, etc.
7. If he had properly encrypted his wallets, the authorities would have been powerless unless they resort to rubber-hose cryptanalysis. They can, however, completely strip his property and dig up the garden. They'd find the gold eventually.
I do take back that I 'hate' gold, though. Thats perhaps too strong a word, but I strongly believe bitcoin has the above advantages and hope we will see a world with bitcoin as a mainstream payment option.

Great analogy, except that bitcoin has a few really useful features that Pokemon cards, tulips and gold don't have, mostly due to it being digital.
For instance, you can teleport it to someone else on the other side of the planet over the internet. Also, you can encrypt it and back it up so you don't have to go through great lengths to hide it or guard it. Furthermore, you can easily split it into tiny units.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:59:11
simple answer: yes it will track price rise/fall, just like any investment regardless of how you store it.
An offline wallet is not an application (a ".exe").
You should read up on the concept and the details of the steps to properly create a safe offline wallet but briefly, what you do is essentially this:
1. You run an application (on a safe computer) that can generate offline wallets. It will generate a (public) bitcoin address for you and a "private key" that you keep secret. You can print these, store them on a USB stick, back them up, etc. Some people etch them into steel, carve them into stone and build their QR code in lego's. Whatever your preference, but whatever you do make *sure* to keep the private key secret. Optionally, you can encrypt the private key to help keep it secret.
2. You buy bitcoins and transfer them to your public Bitcoin address from step 1.
At this point, if you did it properly, your bitcoins are pretty safe. 
3. When, one day, you want to access your coins, you enter your secret private key into an ONLINE bitcoin wallet application of your choice, with which you are then able to make transactions/payments/etc.

In my (admittedly limited) understanding, that presents a problem because it requires the merchant to know from which input he will be payed, whereas that previously seemed irrelevant.
In hardware solutions for bitcoin payments this could be a particularly annoying problem because it requires 2-way communication between the customers mobile device with a wallet and the cashier, whereas before it seemed sufficient to scan a cashiers wallets address with a mobile device and make a transfer.

Its utility is continually improving as more people, merchants and private individuals, are willing to accept it as currency. It becomes useful on an increasingly large scale. Indeed, one more retailer (even a big one), has only a small effect on the price these days. It is not big news anymore.
With respect to altcoins, I don't understand how they are related to this discussion.
I readily admit that calling this moment a golden opportunity is just my own speculation. I have a few thousand of my own $ stuck on gox myself, and feel sorry for anyone that has money stuck there.

An economic crash of a country would work the same. A crash **should** lead to "worthless"/cheap currency. It will then become attractive for other countries to invest/buy their products, thus helping its economy get back on its feet.
Incidentally, that is exactly the problem in Europe, where the richer countries just pour unimaginable amounts of money in inefficient, uncompetitive economies to save the fate of their shared currency, the euro. Allowing uncompetitive countries to go bankrupt and take their own independant currency down with them would have a more healthy outcome in the long run in my opinion.
New worth is not created by printing more money. New worth is created by actually producing something valuable/useful. The rate of the bitcoin will appreciate as more valuable goods are traded for the same fixed amount of currency.

They never lied that the transaction malleability truly did caused their problem, but they **did** lie that this is a bug in the protocol and that they could have done nothing to prevent it.
It is a lie, and it put an unnecessary dent in the public perception of bitcoin. And they let the problem grow completely out of hand before saying anything about it.
They have been singlehandedly responsible for 3 crashes in bitcoin history alone, each of which could have been prevented, and this is the proverbial last straw. Enough is enough.
The only way they can get my business back woudl be if they replace management by capable people and donate every customer at least 1 BTC for the trouble.

Seriously? **Our** supply and demand ofcourse! The people! bitcoin is worth what people perceive it is worth, and that is exactly how it should be.
You buy when you think it has some kind of value to you, and vice versa.
People might buy because they think BTC is the money of the future and speculate on that. Or because they feel fiat stinks. Or because they appreciate the ability to send value across the planet in the blink of an eye without having to deal with sluggish banks and their fees. Or just to make a little fiat profit on the way up to the moon. Whatever the reason, they buy when they perceive it is as valuable and sell when they think it is too pricey.
Everyone does that and the price settles at an equilibrium, where none will buy, and none will sell, until some event upsets the equilibrium.

Because they seemed shady I was hesitant at first, but I honestly must say btc-e has been performing extremely well over an extensive period of time during which many other exchanges failed miserably.

Perhaps you bought them because you like the concept. Then just enjoy the benefits of magically teleporting money around the planet and chuckle as the fiat system begins to crack and rot. When you run out of BTC, buy more.
Alternatively, your plan may be to make money speculating. Then, decide for yourself. Expect it to go down?--&gt; sell. Expect it to go up?--&gt;buy. Make trades every few minutes or just hodl to the moon? The decisions are yours only.

First, on a computer that is not connected to the internet, booted from a fresh linux install CD, create an offline (paper) wallet. Find a tutorial on how to do this properly.
Then, install the bitcoin client (on a known malware-free computer), connect your old harddisk, replace the bitcoin client wallet.dat with your old wallet.dat, and immediately transfer the coins to your newly created safe offline wallet.
Ideally, you could even generate a transaction offline, but this is a little complex and you don't want to mess up and lose coins (which can happen if you get it wrong). Also, AFAIK bitcoin-qt can not currently generate offline transactions and other wallets can't import your wallet.dat

Yes, you really should look into this. Cold storage is the safest way to store bitcoins. If you are not doing anything with them ('holding'), you should definately store your coins offline.
It would take too long to fully explain the process of generating a paper wallet or other offline storage here, as the details matter. No shortcuts. But it has been described in detail in numerous places. Just google 'bitcoin paper wallet', or 'bitcoin offline wallet' or terms like that.

It has nothing to do with the protocol. Miners can fully conform to the protocol and decide freely which transactions they include in their blocks.
In fact, they already do this: they prioritize transactions with fees over those that don't have fees, driven by the financial advantages of doing so. However, nothing prevents them from deciding not to include the hackers transactions. Ofcourse, it would only be effective if essentially all miners collectively agree to do this, lest someone finds a block and includes the hackers transaction.

No, because firstly moving them would cause huge panic so the big player is essentially stuck with them too and secondly small amounts are not worth revealing his identity.

MtGox was once by far the largest exchange and has recovered from really bad events in the past. It appeared in the past a constant, reliable rock in a tumultuous sea of hacks and problems. This has changed dramatically over the last year particularly, and losing something we held on to for so long causes unrest and uncertainty which is reflected in this price drop. But it is necessary, we'll have to move on, keep what is good and get rid of what holds us back.
When we free ourselves of much of the uncertainty, bad publicity, and reports of people losing huge numbers of coins to hacks/poor exchanges/theft we will see bitcoin rise to unprecedented levels.

Staying anonymous took careful planning and great discipline. It is not very difficult to believe he planned from the start to never use any of those coins.
If personal wealth was important to him, he could easily have mined or bought a serious amount of coins in the early days using a identity different from SN without revealing himself.
However, what I find surprising is that he left the question open. It is a source of uncertainty that seems undesirable to me.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:01:09
In principle, that makes sense. He owes us BTC. Who wants to have a small amount of fiat returned when they all figure it out 3 years from now, only to have to back in at $10000/BTC?

In an early stage of bitcoin, in parallel to being Satoshi, you adopt a second identity. This time, someone relatively normal and inconspicuous and who just happened to stumble upon bitcoin in the early days. You easily mine another shitload of coins. You use this second stash of coins to live a good life. You never touch Satoshi's coins except maybe to prove your identity if needed.
Satoshi will have had the foresight to do this. In the unlikely event he did not, the remaining options are less elegant:
1. he could destroy all of his coins by sending them to a bitcoineater address except what he actually intends to use/spend. Then buy the car.
2. Ask for permission on reddit before every big spend

While I agree that the Euro is the problem, or rather the EU, the comparison with the US in this way seems odd.
Europe has gone through innumerable wars, civil and otherwise, on all scales imaginable. Some decimated the male population by quite a bit more than 10% (46% of the german male population in WO II was either dead or seriously wounded). Some wars lasted for decades. Ashamed of our collective history, but slaves were traded in europe for thousands of years, well before Columbus even set foot on America.
You do have a good point with the no common culture/language issue, however.
Regardless, I fail to see how any of this helps unite Europe.

I get so tired of this argument.
Without exchanges, the value of bitcoin would be 0 by now.
There would not have been any significant trade in the past decade and no way to establish value.
There need to be some -very- easy way for Joe and his mother to get fiat in and out of bitcoin for it to ever go anywhere. Who would buy bitcoin right now if there was no way to trade it back into fiat?
Don't suggest localbitcoins is a serious solution. Meeting in public locations with strangers for shitloads of cash is a recipe for disaster too.
Moving bitcoin in and out of exchanges all the time will cost a lot in fees and will cause you to miss trading opportunities.
Maybe a better solution will come along, but for now, keeping some money on an exchanges is a necessary evil for some.

They are real orders, in the sense that they are really there in the order book and work like a kill or fill order. But their behaviour suggests they are not meant to be filled, and often remain in the order books for hours, sometimes days, presumably to try to manipulate the market in some direction.

Sounds like he/his institution is making the same error that used to be common here a few years ago.
Price determines mining, not the other way around.
If the price drops to a low enough level for a long period of time, inefficient miners will eventually be forced to turn of their equipment. That has happened several times before, and is not a very big deal. It keeps mining competitive. It would take a very dramatic drop for a very long time for the network to seriously be 'at risk'.
Breakeven for miners with cheap electricity is in the $3k \- $4k range now.

Bitcoins transactions themselves cannot be fraud.
Everybody can see the transactions. But they'd need to know who owns what address, and why two parties would be exchanging value.
Any proof that they can do that for a large fraction of all transactions (since they are claiming 80%), other than just mentioning they have  "chain analysis tools"?

Sure. The only requirement really is that you can transfer coins between exchanges. If there is a better deal for any given coin pair at another exchange, accounting for the fees associated with the trade itself and the withdrawal/deposit processes, you could in principle exploit it. I'm sure people even have bots doing exactly this right now. It keeps the price at different exchanges synchronised.
When a price at an exchange strongly deviates from other exchanges, that may be a sign that something is wrong with deposits/withdrawals.

The current price is the average of everyones beliefs about the future of bitcoin.
Some people have indeed priced in the next halvening. And all subsequent ones. They are those that plan to hodl indefinitely.
Yet others have planned more short-term bets, counting on the effect of just the next halvening.
So, all future halvenings are 'priced in' to the extent that they are weighted according the perceived certainty of future events as estimated by all of us.
As time passes, the future of bitcoin will become increasingly clear to everyone and consequently its price will move closer to its 'real' value.

My guess is that the exchange moved the BTC to a cold wallet.
 Its a good and normal security precaution.

1. Price is established by supply and demand. When supply (from miners) halves, price is expected to double (as it consistently has, to date), and mining therefore should remain profitable.
2. Yes. Conversely, for as long as a single miner remains in the world, bitcoin lives on. Considering there are bitcoin satellites orbiting the earth that likely could be configured to mine (if they don't already), its unlikely for this to happen in the near term. Long-term, if bitcoin remains of importance, someone will be mining.
3. Possible. Regardless of Satoshi's motives, bitcoin is what it is and many people consider it useful. Most of what we know about Satoshi strongly suggests making money was not his/her/their main motivation, but certainly the potential existed and it can't be ruled out.
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:01:25
It reinforces the public perception that using bitcoins is an act of desparation. "People use bitcoins only when there is no reasonable alternative left".

Guys, don't be so harsh. We should be helping beginners.
OP,  bitcoin is a currency.
Like all currencies, the exchange rate between bitcoin and other currencies varies from moment to moment.
You can exchange some of your fiat money (e.g. US dollars) into bitcoin when the exchange rate of bitcoin is low.
When you exchange your bitcoin back into USD when the exchange rate is higher, you get more USD than you had before.
Some people get paid in bitcoin. However, most people simply buy bitcoin on an exchange.
A third possibility to obtain bitcoin is 'mining', but unless you have free electricity, that is unlikely to be cheaper than simply buying bitcoin. It is also a lot more work and requires a little bit of technical knowledge.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:25:38
It has been to $48.48 before, and that was only because some guy just said it was worth $50.
I'd say the situation now is much better, a new ATH for LTC is 'realistic'.
Some say that because the coin limit is four times that of BTC, one LTC should be worth 1/4th of BTC, so that'd be about $300 at present. Who knows. We'll see what the market decides.

Although I've used the word here myself, actually I believe that "realistic", "more realistic" (most realistic, mostesest realisticsts) mean little. It will be worth what people value it at, and if the past means anything, cryptocurrencies prices can rapidly swing well beyond what most people would consider realistic.

It is not a rational decision. Bitcoin has an advantage being the first, largest and best well known crypocoin.

from amosweb eyncyclonomic webpedia
    The four primary characteristics of money are: (1) durability, (2) divisibility, (3) transportability, and (4) noncounterfeitability.
For bitcoin:
(1) one bitcoin will forever remain one bitcoin. It won't wear, change or lose value due to inflation, unless we all agree to a change in the protocol.
(2) It is more divisible than any other money I am aware of. One satoshi is small enough that if bitcoin ever replaces all money (globally), the value of one satoshi would be approximately one US cent (which I believe  is not a coincidence).
(3) Can you teleport fiat across the planet in seconds by email?
(4) Bitcoin wins hands-down over any other form of money man has ever invented.
Sure, speculators probably make up a large part of the market right now. Bitcoins eventual value should be based on actual usefulness. But the potential is there, and many of us are betting on that.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:10:19
True, but you pay for that service.
Once you get paid in bitcoin, nobody can ever take that money away from you anymore, and that can be a benefit.
With creditcards, if the customer is unhappy (or pretends to be), the merchants pays the price.

You should have been here during the really depressing times in the past. Tell me, today, does it feel like it is possible, even likely, that bitcoin will just slowly die and that that would be it. Not come back ever?

Well…to back all fiat globally with bitcoin will lead to a price of about $0.01 per satoshi, making the current 12.5 BTC block reward worth about $12.5 million (ignoring mining fees). Daily block rewards would be worth $12.5 million * 6 * 24 = $1.8 billion
Let's assume a price of about $0.06 per kWh (comparable to the price in Sweden, which is relatively cheap in the range for EU countries).
This will lead to a daily energy consumption of 1.8 billion/0.06= 3*10^10 kWh = 30 TWh.
**Annual energy consumption expended for bitcoin mining would become about 30*365 = 10950 TWh.
This is roughly half of the current global electricity consumption.**
And I ignored mining fees and used a conservatively low price for electricity, so it will be probably be a low estimate.
 That would definitely have an environmental impact, arguably more so than precious metal mining.

With regard to the forks, I guess it matters only to those that call any of the alternative chains 'bitcoin'. People that favour BTC can ignore the forks as if they never existed (or sell them for free money indeed).
Re 3, I think bitcoin does stimulate services like paypal, banks, etc. to implement/continue to offer rapid, cheap money transfers.

No, it is independent of the type of miner.
It just assumes that miners will continue to mine and invest in more equipment as long as that is a profitable thing to do.

Banks will rediscover what their original purpose was. Probably, the first types of cryptocoin based products that they will offer are cryptowallets and money transfer services.

That is very much what bitcoiners don't want.
The bank will 'promise' to give them back... until they can't. Then it turns out the risks they were taking with your money were actually yours.
Because it is glaringly obvious there is a problem there, the government has a band-aid: they promise to pay you back (up to some maximum) if the bank can't. Ofcourse, they do not 'have' the money either. They just print a little more if necessary, effectively taking a little bit of value away from everyone else that was holding fiat.

You need to have some money in reserve to survive unexpected events. Especially if you have a family.

I'll second that.  In 2011, I sold the coins I had mined at $5, after watching it slowly decline from $31. Then I gave up mining, as it was not profitable considering the cost of electricity. It proceeded to move down to $2-something. I felt stupid for believing this monopoly money would become the money of the internet. I thought that one peak to $31 was all that ever was going to happen, and I missed it. I felt stupid for buying 2 BTC at the very tip of that peak. $60 was a significant amount of money for me at that time. When people said 'we are still early adopters', I thought 'yeah right, bitcoin has been here for two years."
Long story short, you cannot believe the shit bitcoin has went through since. Today, I feel there is not a cloud in the sky. There is nothing truly threatening bitcoin, and it looks like governments, companies and consumers are opening up to its possibilities at an enormous scale. It has shown that it is here to stay, which was highly doubtful in the past. Governments are also realizing this and are trying to come up with regulations.  They seems fairly reasonable so far. Bitcoin needs this regulation to become truly accepted and adopted at a massive scale, so I welcome it.
Sure, its exchange rate is going down right now. That was also very much expected to happen sooner or later. It could have gone up further perhaps, but it was clearly overvalued and this 'correction' is a healthy development. There will be a bottom somewhere, and then it will go back up sometime in the future, as adoption continues to grow. It could take a while for that to happen, as it has in the past, but eventually, I believe, it will.
After all that: DONT'T INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE... seriously! Nobody can guarantee that bitcoin will ever again have today's value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:41:43
This, I suspect many here are only beginning to experience the true emotions behind 'hodl'.
Folks, there will be a moment when you will seriously doubt whether bitcoin will ever recover. And it -really- may not. It's why you often hear the advice 'don't invest more than you are willing to lose'.
It is quite possible you will actually lose most of your investment.
There is no guarantee btc will ever again have todays value.

If a huge amount of tether was created over the past few months without USD to back them up, and those tethers were then used to buy BTC, it drove the price of BTC up artificially. That would mean that the incredibly cryptocurrency price rally is not reflective of real demand. BTC value should then be valued much lower than today.

I think it is not a coincidence.
Satoshi designed bitcoin to be a currency, and if it is to replace all money, its smallest unit should be similarly valued to the smallest unit we use today, ie one cent. So 1 BTC should be about $1,000,000 then.

I am disputing that banks are *evolving* or innovating at any appreciable rate. Ofcourse they perform a few *useful* functions, but they are fossilized institutions that are mostly just focused on generating profit for their own sake. Banks are useful and will probably stay around for a while. However, hopefully, cryptocurrencies will make them rethink what their core business really is and what makes them valuable to customers (=society).
1) This service goes back to biblical times. In fact the word "bank" is derived from "banca"; the benches on which the moneylenders sat when trading. (source: 
In my language (Dutch), the word "bank" is still the same for both a bench or a bank.
2) A combination of loans and digital transactions. Digital transaction I've already credited as an innovation and loans are nothing new. (Besides, while common in the US and perhaps elsewhere, credit cards are not a very common means of payment where I live. I don't have a credit card and don't see any need for one).
3) Stock brokers have existed for over 100 years.
4) Core business of banks since forever. Not innovative.
5) Only for digital transactions do banks perform any role in this. I've already credited that as an innovation. Otherwise, cash, gold, and sea shells can be used to perform payments just fine, as they have for thousands of years.
6) is not a recent innovation either and not essentially different from 4 anyway.
7) Certainly goes back to medieval times, even possibly thousands of years BC according to wikipedia. Not a recent innovation by any means.

The rest of us can trust that it is extremely likely that competent people will scrutinize the math and the code.
Especially for bitcoin, because the potential rewards are high, it is a near certainty that good hackers will constantly try very hard to exploit any flaw they can find.
Every year that no such flaws are found is a very good sign even for those that can't read code.

Good thinking, and it already exists. You have re-invented something called "arbitrage".
In the past, mt got and other exchanges had an instant credit point system by which you could quickly transfer money from one exchange to another. During periods of high volatility, it was really easy sometimes to spot an opportunity, sometimes making a very satisfying profit by acting quickly.
However, that was prohibited at some point (understandably, because it makes tracking money even more difficult for the authorities than it is already with bitcoin), at which point the prices between exchanges started to diverge quite a bit more.

Now, that would be very interesting indeed. At that point, the only person knowing that Satoshi is alive and well and able to communicate is Craig, but he can't tell the world because the rest of the world thinks he himself is Satoshi.
At that point, Satoshi could seek to contact him and communicate through him without making a public appearance.
There are some striking parallels to religion btw. Should it not also be easy for God to unambiguously prove His existence? Yet he leaves us in doubt for thousands of years, and we're stuck with a book that can be interpreted in many different ways.
Craig could have become Satoshi's first profet, but it looks like that did not happen this time.

While the insight is interesting, there is no equivalent to bitcoin on the periodic table. All stable elements have some practical use (even if obscure) including Terbium. Terbium is useful in the amplification of light for data transmission in glass fibers. Very likely, it played a critical role in transmitting this very message to the reddit server.
Some of the highly unstable elements like Mendelevium, Nobelium or Lawrencium however are totally useless. Just of scientific interest. But as most isotopes of these elements decay in a few milliseconds, they are a poor store of value.

Exchanges and users continue to get hacked and lose coins to theft, until eventually everyone is so thoroughly fed up with losing coins that they'll give up on bitcoin entirely.
And the standard reply here seems to be "then don't keep your coins on an exchange, stupid" makes no sense. We need to be able to exchange freely to establish price, and if users and exchanges can't even simply store and exchange coins safely and effortlessly, well that is a problem for bitcoin's future. How many of BTC have been stolen at this point? 10%? Imagine 10% of users losing their lifesavings to theft with no authority able to help.

I first bought in June 2011, at the very peak of the first bubble at $31 (now an imperceivable blip on the charts, but it seemed insane at the time). Sold around $5 and saw it go down to $2 which confirmed that I had been stupid investing in magic internet Monopoly money. Not proud of my lack of vision, but so be it. I clearly missed a great opportunity.
In my defence, that was the first bubble/rally. For all everyone knew, that was it. There might never come a second, third or fourth one.
My point is that now, IMO, you should be able to HODL and relax. We are bound to revisit $3000 and move upwards someday.

The 2020 halvening is not something to be factored in in addition to what OP was saying. The halvenings are simply the reason/the mechanism behind the reduced supply of (mined) coins in the future.
Lost coins, yes. But nobody knows exactly how many are lost and how many will become lost in the future, so that is hard to factor in.
I think a lot more coins were lost in the early days than will happen in the future. Coins were cheap, and the wallets available were not as good as they are today. It was much easier to make a mistake in a transaction. People lost/threw away storage media with wallets that held hundreds or thousands of coins.

Your question can be split into two questions which I think may help to clear things up:
Q1: What is the best way to keep my coins secure?
Answer: an 'offline' or 'cold' wallet.
Storing coins 'offline' means storing the private keys on a device (computer, phone, USB stick, but it even be a piece of paper) that is not connected to the internet in any way. 'wallets' like Electrum are essentially just a piece of software that helps you manage your collection of private keys. Electrum running on a computer that is kept offline would be an offline wallet.
So by definition, you can not use an online machine to make an offline wallet.
Keeping coins 'offline' is a very good way to securely store your coins regardless of if a split will occur or not.
Q2: How to make sure you'll have your coins on chain that you deem is the most favourable after the split?
Answer: Use a private key that you control, not a key that is under control of an exchange or another third party.
This could be an 'online' wallet, in the sense that you could run Electrum or any other wallet software of your choice on a machine that is connected to the internet. While that would present a security risk as described above, it would not affect your options in case of a fork.

Ask yourself what backs up the value of gold? What makes it so valuable? Sure, it has a few uses in industry but they are minor, and certainly don't justify its value. I think you will have to come to the conclusion that, similarly, it boils down to faith.
The value of bitcoin IMO is based solely on the expectation that it is going to be the primary means of payment on the internet in the future. People bet on that becoming true, and as it seems more and more likely that this will eventually become true, more people are willing to make that bet.
Indeed, if for some reason we all stop believing that, its value will plummet.

Definately buy. Save yourself the significant trouble and the very real risk that mining turns out to be more expensive (unless you have free electricity and/or don't mind the risk and/or want to contribute to the strength of the bitcoin network).
Realistically, the relative benefits from mining are going to be small. To see that for yourself, calculate your projected mining results ( taking into account the rapidly increasing difficulty,  delivery times of a mining rig and electricity costs, and balance that against just buying now.

Overestimated, not underestimated.
If every person active in bitcoin makes 10 addresses, your calculation overerstimates the number of users by a factor of 10.
A total wild guess: I'd consider it likely that there are at least 100 addresses for each person actively using bitcoin. Note that exchanges, shops etc also generate temporary addresses to deal with your business. Even if every single bitcoin user was living in the USA, that still only amounts to 100% * 14E6/321E6 = 0.04%.
So, 1% is a huge overestimation in my opinion. Worlwide, I'd bet &lt;0.0001% is more near the truth.

Bitcoin is valuable because it has desirable properties. To name a few in random order that should appeal to a lot of people:
1. It can not be counterfeited
2. If stored properly, it cannot be stolen or confiscated
3. You can make backup copies and store them in different places
4. You can instantly transmit it to anywhere on the planet, at no significant cost.
5. Transactions are definitive and final. You can 100% rely on the coins being and staying yours when you receive them. 
None of these things can be done with gold or cash except perhaps 5 if you are trading in person.
A lot of people also appreciate that it is not regulated by a government that prints money to cover its debts, making your own savings become gradually less valuable.

Then mined another 40 btc or so myself with GPUs. Sold most around $5. Saw it drop further to $2. "Geez, what was I thinking, investing in Monopoly money". But kept an eye on it. Bought back some around $50. Spent countless hours simply watching crazy rallies and crashes, just for the thrill of it. Lost some to gox, lost some to bitcoin24, lost some to bad trading decisions.

Very unlikely. The last time I broke even with respect to electricity costs using GPU mining was in late 2011. (my electricity is relatively expensive). For some time then, the costs were nearly equal to the cost of simply buying coins. I I still kept mining for some time though, and held the coins so that it turned out to have been profitable eventually. Now, with the FPGAs and ASICs, and the staggering difficulty, I very much doubt you'll get anywhere near breakeven..

If all 7 billion people start hashing by hand, humanity can do 0.0000295 * 7E9 = 206500 hashes/second
So, according to that linked calculator, the difficulty should drop to 0.02885 to maintain 10 minutes per block.
Maybe in a post-apocalyptic world, when computers and other electrical equipment doesn't work anymore. But we have to find out how to globally spread the new block in 10 minutes.
Maybe we should agree then to slow down to 1 block per year.

Put in no more than you are comfortable with losing completely and hope for the best. Worst case 100% lost of what you put in, but possibly &gt;10000% profit.

"4 tons of money" :) google translate
For the non-Dutch speakers a 'ton' is Dutch slang for 100,000 Euro
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:36:08
You can't force a name. Give it enough time and as bitcoins become common currency nicknames will develop eventually. Probably different names in different parts of the world, derived from local slang.
Our pre-Euro currency in the Netherlands had all kinds of names, often based on the looks of the coins/bills. We still have hardly any nicknames for the Euro coins/bills, even after 11 years of common use.

Indeed, they do use your money while it is in your account. How else do you think they generate the interest you receive at the end of the year?
It is a fraction of the profit they made speculating with your money while you were not using it.
The difference is, they still need to be able to give it back to you the instant you ask for it. When you hit the  transfer button, however, a brief period starts during which no-one expects to have the coins back while they are 'on their way' to the receivers account. Thus, they can use them completely for speculating for a while.
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:23:02
2.4 billion people have internet access in the world. If only 10% of those each invests $100, and the total number of bitcoins that will -ever- exist is 21 million, then 2.4E9 * 0.1 * $100 / 21E6 = $1100.
I think that is conservative. Also consider that lots of coins got lost (private key lost/deleted/forgotten), reducing the total number available and that it will take untill 2033 to mine all the coins, so until then the total number of coins in existence is lower than 21 million.
So, I believe will eventually settle in the $1000-$2000 range, but it will overshoot that value at first by a large factor, fueled by the hype. $10000 may be very well possible.
So, $200 is a bargain! Get them while you can!

I'm Dutch too, and your translation is closer but not quite literal either.
But anyway, the point is that the argument that they want to take action when counterfeiting takes places makes no sense in the world of bitcoin.
Reading between the lines, it looks to me they are trying to scare the public to legitimate regulation/control.

At my GPU miners were keeping the attic nice and warm during the winter of 2011. Free heating (profitable even). These days, you need to do it for the love of bitcoin.

If this is true, then banks desperately need bitcoins themselves!
It is hard to believe though that they still do this manually, which is not only expensive but also prone to errors.

Redo your calculations.
Converting all USD alone would already get us to $500,000 per bitcoin (10.5 trillion USD existed in july 2013 according to  So, if all currency worldwide was switched to BTC it would be an astronomically high value. Way, way more than a million USD / BTC.

Pretty accurate analogy of the price movements. It'll be all right, just hold onto them and forget about it for some months.

I should be recommended to test your password before sending coins to your wallet.

+1, the only reason I made money mining when it was about $5/BTC was by holding.
Ofcourse, you could argue it is a lot less work just buying the coins then.
