I have bought every Btc I own from  which will only be of use if you are in Australia, you pay a broker fee of about $40 on each Bitcoin but the whole process takes about 25 min. You do have to visit a bank branch and physically transfer the money the money into their account but it is well worth it.  
  
I bought in hat $500 a coin, that $40 fee each doesn't look so large any more :)

The effort required to double spend a transaction when you're just ordering a muffin or coffee would not make sense at all. 0 confirmations will do fine on transactions of that size.
Also, FYI Menulog is an online food delivery business.

There is a nice little cafe down near my work in Circular Quay called "The Pit-stop". Maybe they could rename it the "The Bit-stop" and put your ATM in there.

Coffee is decent. Food is great, they have quite a lot of space in the dining area I would say you could definitely carve out a spot to locate it no problem at all. Very nice staff, I get along with them well. Not sure on wifi, I always eat upstairs in my office.
How does the cafe gain from hosting the machine, do you pay them a percentage of the profits?  
 
Also the place was just bought by two late 20's (Indains?) they seem pretty tech savvy so I think you would have a pretty easy time winning them over on the concept.

I have been a long-time user of Menulog.
I was wondering if you may consider accepting Bitcoin as a payment method on your website?
Bitcoin is my preferred way to pay for pretty much anything I buy these days, I know I would certainly order more from Menulog if you did accept it.
You can find more information at  or just have a Google there is plenty of info out there.

I would suggest they enlist the help of a payment processor to convert them to AUD instantly if that is their concern for not having implemented btc already. Maybe not initially but down the track I would hope Menulog would give the option for merchants that are registered with them to receive btc directly minus their fee of course.
  
This could be a game changer for the Australian bitcoin space and make ordering food online that little bit easier. 
Having a discount when using bitcoin to compensate all parties along the way would also be a major draw.

Watching bitcoin infrastructure progress from dodgy looking tied together graphic cards to professional and impressive looking ASIC machines really demonstrates how far have come in only a few short years.  
  
I would assume in the next few years all bitcoin mining will be done in massive data centers with thousands upon thousands of rows of ASIC's pumping out billions of TH.

I would say he is so chill because he is sitting on 10k worth of BTC still, he says he is not in the post but come on an early adopter like that surely tucked a few thousand away.

It also seems they have been reading this sub and linked my post  in the article.

Wow, this is great.  
 
I have personally emailed them a few times asking them to take Bitcoin, I'm also probably their biggest customer in the country haha.
EDIT: I see they linked my previous post haha, progress!

Much better than the usual "Fuck off and learn how to use Bitcoin approach"
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:42:53
I completely disagree.  
 
Me giving tips is not about the amount, its about giving people a little bit of coin to play around with, transfer back and forth etc and experiment with a small amount of bitcoin.

The fund should be sent to your armory wallet pretty much immediately and will show zero confirmations, they will just show up as unconfirmed.
It's only after a certain amount of confirmations that they can be spent though, I am not 100% sure but I believe it is 6 confirmations.

A bank backed wallet that is free when you have a saving account with them would be amazing, also being able to buy btc in person over the counter (maybe those forex kinds of booths off to the side) would be great.

[Article](  


**This was the 9th paragraph down before they said the first positive thing.** 
If i had plenty of currency to spare i would be handing Btc out in decent quantities (100-150 Btc) to technology editors in the big media houses that write this negative scaremongering rubbish, you could set it up so the Btc given were only accessible after 2.5 years. If that was the case imagine how involved they would get looking at past history of Btc price and how astronomically high it could be in two and a half years. Throwing a positive spin on Bitcoin's image in the majority of Australian newspapers would really lead to mass adoption imo.   
  
If anyone is willing to write a letter to SMH explaining the benefits of Bitcoin i will happily send it to their [FB page](
