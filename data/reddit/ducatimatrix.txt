How do you manage the arbitration ?  Is this something you do on your own or is this a company?

I'm trying to find out who can resolve bitcoin purchase issues
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:24:41
I have not done a purchase yet, but I'm doing market research into this type of business.  Bitrated seems to be what people point me to, but that's really more of a marketplace for individuals rather than companies who do this full time.

That's a great site , I'm currently doing market research into this type of business.  I'm fairly new to bitcoin so it's a challenge.   So my own disclaimer is that the company I represent is thinking about spinning up a similar service.    If your open to it I would love to ask you some questions about it.

Have you used this service before?

Right on, what about getsqr.com for a company called square deal, do you think that would be better or worse?
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:33:28
Is there any you like from the list in the first comment?
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:34:25
Thanks !

I just searched the web, what I was really looking for was arbitration / escrow companies.  That could by why I didn't get coinkite on the list, from the web page it looks more like just a wallet.  I'm glad for your comment so I can check them out as well.

It was a risk I willing to take when I posted them:)  There are a few already purchased just in case, but we figured this open source community is gonna be ok
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:46:46
That's interesting, but would that be able to limit the chance of collusion?  That seems to be one of the main concerns using multi-sig transfers.  
@_date: 2015-09-15 02:23:21
This is really interesting for someone like me who's company is attempting some BTC entrepreneurship.  Is it possible that all the work we are doing now could soon be for nothing and we will have to start over.  I see so many articles about new launches and lots of hype, but try to visit the site and it's already gone.

Thanks, 
Yours was one of the sites I liked most. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:30:55
That could be a good thing.  More stability would bring more users, more users would mean more Bitcoin businesses. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:40:31
Thanks!  That's a good one, I'm surprised I couldn't find it in my research.  I'll definitely have to look it a little more.  It's interesting that the mention co sign coin, I couldn't find them although I found a lot of talk about them. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:49:00
That's a good point, can't argue that. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:47:57
LOL, I guess I can scratch that one off the list then.
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:04:42
Here are some ideas we have been kicking around if anyone cares to comment. 
squareddeal.com 
sqare.io 
beefair.io

I'm interested to hear from anyone who has used these companies to hear about their experience.  I would also like to know of any companies that should have made the list.  
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:07:35
More people jump on the band wagon on the way up, but it is being treated more like a company stock rather than a true currency.  Not enough people will use it for goods and services, rather they try to play the exchange.  That's why most busniesses at this point are wallets and exchanges, very few marketplaces out there.  Businesses need consumers.

What domain would you go with?
