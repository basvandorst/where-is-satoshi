It is also because they can see the writing on the wall. Digital currency will eventually kill PayPal.  They can't adopt it and keep current revenue / margin levels and competitors are coming up all over the place.
By separating they can extract every last bit of value out of what PayPal has left and Ebay is free to explore digital currency and boost its bottom line.

This is a poor infographic.  It tells us that if you have a fast enough computing ability you can alter things.  Forget about  block 74, it makes it seem very plausible to alter block 90.

I hear a lot of people saying this, but from the article you actually posted:
"The ruling does not apply beyond Ms. Berwick and could be altered if Uber’s appeal succeeds. "
They will be ICs for quite some time.  It's not unthinkable a future ruling could make it retroactive to some point.  But as it stands right now it only impacted one person and that hasn't even gone through appeals yet.

This is why poker is so profitable (for some)...
Starting hands are irrelevant unless you are getting it all in at the start (and of course you can still lose with the at the time best hand...).  How you play the hand is what matters.  All winning players know when to fold aces and wait for a better spot.
The problem here is that the opponents of bitcoin are not merely another player.  They are the house, and they could care less how we take money from other players.  Bitcoin (and the blockchain) threaten their **vigorish**, and they will not stand for that.

I think I know the answer... but is anyone going to jail for this?  It looks like they have identified the specific people involved...
