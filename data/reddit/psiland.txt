When CME was announced, BTC was tarded at 6.1k $ , We are defenetly oversold now.
BTC is meant to be a censorship resistant decentralized digital currency. I think Satoshi cared more about this than 2mb blocks.
Bitmain is a profitable business that is at risk with segwit.
That shit about 8mb block, cheap fees is just bs. 
With segwit bitmain and big miners will loose a lot of money and this "attack" on friday is actualy their last desperate chance to make money and pump and dump BCH.
But next week BCH will dump hard and btc will consolidate or pump, I don't see it go below 6k$.
Bitcoin core should think about another solution to make mining more decentralized, maybe POW.
IMO this is a bigger issue than scalling, I don't care if it takes 1 week to transfert btc, as long as the price goes up :D.
We should reward miners but not let them in a position of manipulating the price with their FUD and shitcoins.

Sell or buy on QuadrigaCX but don't day trade, fees are huge (0.5%).
It should be your entry or exit point.
Use another exchange like Kraken or binance for day trades or fees will eat a lot of your profits.

Amazon migth use a blockchain solution for its supply chain, however I don't see the value of amazon using bitcoin.
At the current state, it take an hour to confirm a transaction, if amazon uses bitcoin the network migth get saturated and fees migth go higher.
They migth also crash the market when they will convert bitcoin to fiat. Amazon margin is very low, so they need to give back to their suppliers fiat currency.
And how will they initiate refunds? Price is highly volatile, so 30 days from buying, will they return the same amount of bitcoin or return a fiat equivalent of the purchase ?
Anyway if there is a dip tomorow, i'm buying.
