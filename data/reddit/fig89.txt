could be intentional, or it could be that a lot of people into bitcoin are not so good at managing resources.

this x a million. this is the solution to our current market related problems. we need competition in market places, and if people are worried about regulated exchanges, why not set up an unregulated one?

Bitcoins don't have the printing presses problem as they expand at a known rate that won't change, so bitcoin 'inflation' is not very much like USD inflation.
Generally, I would expect bitcoins to gain in value relative to non-virtual fiat currencies as bitcoins become more ubiquitous and as fiat currencies collapse due to unsupportable debt obligations being solved by money printing.

inflation in commodities is about 30% for us. the imploding housing bubble is roughly half of our cpi, which causes the overall cpi to edge up only slightly, while if you actually look at what is happening in the data, the formulas are constantly being rearranged to make it look like we have acceptable inflation when in fact we have utter collapse in housing market and massive inflation in inelastic consumer goods.

I don't think this is a problem.
Bitcoin is completely open source, so if people start seeing funny business, there is nothing preventing some other people from continuing bitcoin in a non-government regulated manner.
Further they were really only talking about regulating exchanges... which just means there will be competition in exchanges. I'm sure someone can set up a mtgox equivalent on a .onion or something.

You apparently haven't heard of QE1. or QE2.

And the Fed has a track record of doing what exactly under Bernanke? Under Greenspan? In general since its creation?

Real wages are going down because the government has run our entire economy on massive debt, which has to be serviced, ultimately eroding real wages.

that makes sense. with a market with such low volume, a withdrawl of that magnitude is a good candidate for a price drop.
couple that with the confusion about garzik supporting regulating bitcoin exchanges, shcumer going after and ostensibly causing silk road to shut down for a while days, and all the troubles with mtgox and dwolla processing stuff, id say we have a good list of culprits as to why the market is dropping.
THIS IS GOOD. it means there are actual reasons, not a general lack of faith in the currency or something. fix the problems, and we should be back on track. hopefully that track wont be as volatile as the past.

this is true. the jeff garzik supporting regulating exchanges and the mtgox sucking at handling high volume is/was real too. i meant that people panic sold simply upon hearing the news without actually assessing whether or not said news had a direct effect on bitcoin.

remember losses aren't realized unless you panic sell. if you sit tight, problems can be resolved, and value can be restored.
