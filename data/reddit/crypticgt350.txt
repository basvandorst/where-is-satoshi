You will make money. Mine ZEC and convert to Bitcoin through an exchange. The reward/electricity cost ratio is about 4 to 1. If you time your trades to BTC when ZEC is up, then you can see an even higher profit margin when BTC goes up.

Not sure where you got $1300 from, but the exchange rate is the current price to buy or sell 1 whole BTC.
$6720 x .0007355 = $4.94
Right now your amount BTC is worth $4.94 because 1 BTC is around $6720.

He’s a realist. He calls it how he sees it. There’s nothing in it for him if he lies to everyone and says that the bottom is any day now. I like his way of thinking and I personally think it will be somewhere between January and April 2019 before we bottom out at around $2.5/$3k. There will probably be a couple temporary bull runs before then. Only extremely positive news can cause it to go back up until then, and I’m not sure how much more positive the news can get for this space.

Who says they’re selling at a loss? I’m sure there are a lot of inexperienced people cashing out at a loss, but I think most of the selling is being done by people taking profits while the getting is still good. BTC was $2.5k a year ago. More than likely we won’t find any real support until $3k imho.

Well I can’t tell you what to do with your current positions on RH, but it sounds like you need to be on Coinbase PRO or Gemini or Kraken if you’re wanting access to an actual exchange that allows limit orders. You can either wire funds to the exchange of your choice, after setting up an account, or deposit funds via ACH, which takes a few days.

Just got an email from Coinbase stating their fees have gone up for small orders, and down for large orders, to “increase liquidity”. Basically jumped from .15% to .5%.
I was paying $0.75 for $500 in BTC, and now I’ll be paying $2.50.
Edit: Coinbase Pro

Well you sell the BTC and then send the money to your bank account.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:29:25
No it’s not. The fees are minimal for limit orders. Transferring money to and from Coinbase Pro is also free unless you wire it.
@_date: 2019-10-30 05:45:14

A quick google search will bring up multiple articles on Quantum Supremacy, and they all say the same thing: It COULD be bad for cryptography, but it’s nowhere near a state where it could be applied to that kind of task. Also, some QS experts believe it would be good for PoS.
Gold mining on asteroids is probably just as far out as actual useful quantum computing. 10 years or so.

Do you realize that ALL fiat currencies fail? ALL OF THEM.
GBP is down 99.5% from its creation, and USD is down 96% from its creation.
They will never recover. Inflation grows exponentially and is a one way ticket to economic collapse.
I’m not saying BTC is the answer, but fiat is the opposite of the answer. It’s the problem.

Wow. Some guy who made his name on his dead fathers legacy, and is all in on gold, is still talking about bubbles as if no other asset class has bubbles? Sounds smart.
He says he knows all about Bitcoin, yet couldn’t even remember the name of its creator, and when told, couldn’t even pronounce the name.

Excluding bullion, mined gold is proportioned as follows:
Jewelry - 38%
Electronics - 34%
Minted Coins - 22%
Other - 6%
The “Other” category is mostly industrial use. So less than 6% of all gold mined is used for the applications that you claim make up the majority of its use cases.
Gold literally only has 2 functioning use cases: corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity.
Jewelry and coins are basically just collectibles.
Do us all a favor and stay out of subs that you have zero knowledge of. That includes all gold/Peter Schiff worshiping subs.

You’re trading your alt for btc. As the supply of btc becomes more scarce, the price goes up due to increasing demand. Opposite is true for the alt being traded. It gets dumped on the market and scarcity declines along with demand, supply goes up, price goes lower. I’m right.

Your 1070 will hash at a realistic rate of about $2.00/day, (prices change too often to estimate accurately) with minimal over clocking. Nvidia 1070's are great with Zcash. Nicehash is a good miner/pool, but I think you pay higher fees than most other pools. I mine Zcash with EWBF miner and suprnova pool with no issues. 8x 1070 STRIX OC cards.

In dollars you're looking at about $60/mo on average with 1 card. Those small numbers are the bitcoin equivalent conversions.

Which wallets/exchanges support Bitcoin Cash

That’s because there’s a lot more dumb fucks than people who care about their future.

Ask WB about anything developed in this millennium. He’ll have the same answer for all of it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:53:45
Yes. You send what you mine to a wallet. Jaxx or Exodus are good. Then exchange the Zcash for Bitcoin or other altcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:04:20
Nope. No private key. Just a souvenir.

OCing will net more in the short term, but you will be replacing the card sooner, of course. Also depends on how hard you over clock. Just bumping up the Mem clock by 350 MHz and maybe 100 MHz Core clock won't be too hard on it. That's about as far as I take mine.
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:17:35
So we have to guess what those reasons are?

Oh, you mean the guy that “knows everything about Bitcoin”, yet couldn’t even get the creators name right? The guy that’s all-in on gold literally.

Our cards are more efficient at mining Zcash and other equihash/dagger hashimoto algorithms. Therefor we can accumulate more Zcash faster than we can accumulate Bitcoin. Bitcoin requires ASICS cards that are meant solely for BTC and/or LTC. That hardware, called Antminer, is almost impossible to buy and if you do buy you will be waiting 4-6 months before you receive it. I get about 1 ZEC every 11 days and then exchange that for BTC. I don't look at the prices or "monthly profits" because I'm not looking to cash out anytime soon.

I don’t disagree with that. I’m saying you should expect this attitude from his type. Why do we keep talking about it? Because another journalist publishes another yes man Op-Ed? Who cares what this guy thinks. He doesn’t like anything from this millennium.

How much more info could we possibly give? They already have our full name, age, sex, address, bank account info, social security  drivers license front and back, passport, multiple selfies, etc. the only things left to give are blood and semen samples.

There is no official statement from Samsung on this, and I’ve already heard this news was found to be illegitimate.

Apparently they couldn’t even get that right because I never receive the confirmation text.
