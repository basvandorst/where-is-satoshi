You should push this reddit post and tweet it out on twitter to CZ and keep going until you get attention. CZ is very conscious about public issues like this as he cares about reputation.

Why is the btc subreddit so much more concerned with slamming core than the other way round?

Thanks for the reply. But can you really imagine a big company like a car manufacturer or sony or property owner basically performing tax evasion with cypto currency through using something like monero, or a newly implemented privacy function on bitcoin ? I feel like they would not take such a risk, then people would have much less incentive to invest, as their profit is taxed so much

fiat is basically normal money that is attached to a geographical area such as USD, but I would say what if they made cashing out incredibly difficult, the IRS are already on Coinbase, you can't just pull out 500k without the tax man coming for you.
It will be interesting to see how the government try and control cryptos, because they certainly will do everything in their power to do so

Yes, but lets say they wanted to make cryptos less of a threat to fiat and prevent cryptos from being so powerful, could they not just tax the fuck out of them so their benefits becomes shadowed by their ridiculous expenses ?
