In hindsight, the major policies should have been read-only, and require a conversation and signed contract to change, for everybody's safety. It's insane that these limitations were so easy to change at such short notice.

Don't need to spoof IPs. Just need to compromise the computer that runs on that IP. THat would also be a way to bypass 2fa (just wait until the admin puts in the 2fa for legit purposes and leaves the room to go to a 2 hr meeting).

All who were affected – I'm sorry for your losses.
Assuming BFX goes back online, and it sounds like they will, how would you like them to address losses?
For example, a payback period, where all profits are used to make victims whole. You get your money back in 1-2 years.
Or should they shut down and use what BTC they have left to pay out a % to everyone.

2) Ad supported   
3) Built on bittorrent    
4) 70% of ad revenue goes to compensate uploaders and seeders. Downloaders don't pay.  
5) Downloaders must rate each download in order to download something else (like Uber requires you to rate drivers before you can order another cab).   
6) Advertisers pay using Bitcoin and anyone who pays scan be an advertiser (similar to Google Adwords)  
7) Supports creators by allowing community moderators to "verify" an uploader. Everyone will then prefer the verified uploader version.   
8) Uses bittorrent for file transfer rather than direct hosting.

The different companies and devs working on it finally agreed to a common protocol spec last week and it can be tested on mainnet. Expect a public release within a few weeks.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology and network. It’s the job of the bitcoin developers to safeguard that network and be long-term thinkers. Slow, expensive payments are a bad UX and needs to be solved, but it’s a shared responsibility of the whole ecosystem, including wallets and exchanges who have not adopted best practices, and it needs to be solved in a way that we won’t regret it in ten years.
It should be better, but this isn’t some frivolous app, and people stomping their feet and acting entitled rather than doing their part is annoying as fuck. You might say *but the users shouldn’t have to do anything* and I would agree with you, but that’s the end goal, not something you can wave a magic wand and make happen.

Manipulators can’t determine the trend. It’s too expensive. They can only catalyze something that was ready to happen anyways, or manipulate on much shorter timeframes. Basically you manipulate to build a bigger long or short position without slippage. You aren’t stepping in front of a train, you are slightly delaying the train so you can cross the tracks.
You bet manipulators kick off major corrections. But those would have happened anyway.

The biggest difference between the two coins is the long vs. short term thinking of the teams, and their relative engineering bench strength.
You’re oversimplifying things by saying “people will use the network with the lowest fees and fastest tx times” because people use bitcoin for many different reasons. High fees will price out lower value use cases in the short term, and some of those people will use other coins if ecommerce is their priority. The fact that high fees are being paid suggests that plenty of people ARE using it and willing to pay those fees for their use case.

So? The market seems to be regulating itself. Ghash used to have over 50%. Now they have only 20%.
I have a hard time understanding how it would be in any single pool owner's best interest to execute such an attack. The real vulnerability would be nefarious hackers taking control of their network. They would have to take control of multiple networks now to have a shot at it, and being successful at that seems unlikely and expensive.
On top of that, there are decentralized mining pools now that might eventually replace the centralized ones:
They currently have 2% of the hashing power and are growing.

An insured exchange? Good luck. 
Some exchanges have FDIC insurance, but that only covers USD balances, so if you are holding BTC, that doesn't work.
Some exchanges have insurance against hacks, like Coinbase. But if your account creds are personally hacked (you get a virus, or the thief circumvents your 2FA somehow) you're out of luck. 
YMMV with holding funds on exchange, depending on how much BTC you're protecting, and what your risk tolerance is. If you're not actively trading, keeping most BTC offline is generally a smart idea. And one solution to avoid exchange risk is to use leverage for trades. So keep 1/3 of your $ on an exchange, and use 3x margin funding to make up the rest. You pay a little in interest but it offsets the risk, IMO.


No. But the currency they are trading is not irreversible, and the insurance for it is much more mature. Someday we'll get there with crypto, but it's far more risky to trade crypto online today than it is to trade a standard currency pair.

The core contributors are individual contributors, not a monolith. It's an open source project. Luke and a few others are pro BIP148, and many others are vocally against it.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:50:41
I'll add my opinion: Most who are still contributing to core believe very strongly in these things:
1) The value of Bitcoin is in it's decentralized nature, and that larger blocks are an unnecessary step that pushes Bitcoin towards centralization. For example, 8MB blocks will lead to 95% of current full nodes shutting down because it requires 64GB RAM. Also, even at 1MB, Bitcoin has latency problems -- they fear the effect of 2MB blocks on latency and network reliability is a big risk, and that layer-2 solutions (yes, including Blockstream's lightning network, as well as any others) are the safest path forward for everyone to achieve VISA scale. Note that most core contributors are not against blocksize increases full stop -- they ARE on the core roadmap. Just not anywhere close to the top of the list because more research is needed and there are other safer near-term solutions.
2) Because Bitcoin is so valuable, any changes to the protocol must be VERY extensively tested and peer reviewed. We're talking like a full year for major changes. They're in no rush.
3) Miners should not have veto power. The signaling bit was put in place as a courtesy for them to signal readiness, not approve/disapprove of something.
All other groups (BTU, BitcoinABC, Segwit2x) differ on pretty much all three of these things, as well as others.
In addition to miners, non-technical people (e.g. companies in the space) see Segwit2x as a political compromise, but also don't seem to value these three points as much as engineers who have worked on Bitcoin for years and understand it at a deep level. All they know is the network needs more capacity and doubling the blocksize seems okay to them as a band aid solution.
Almost everyone except Bitmain supports Segwit itself. Bitmain has reasons not to support it, like how it disables covert ASICboost. The controversy is around the "2x" part (blocksize increase) and in miners/others switching to a totally unproven client with unproven developers.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:18:17
Don't do it. Get a HW wallet. Trading will continue but it's not worth the stress IMO. Your best bet if you NEED to trade is to do it carefully with leverage so you don't risk your whole stack.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:51:16
Oh, I can tell how eager you are.
To be clear, there's not one thing we can do. Centralization is a creeping, ever-persistent force. A good bitcoin developer will consider maintaining decentralization in everything they do. For example, counterbalancing the extra bandwidth required by nodes for segwit blocks with another offsetting efficiency gain (compact blocks). When you do things like willy-nilly increase block size, you have to consider that based on existing research (see [Bitfury's research]( if you bump the base blocksize to 8mb, we might lose 95% of existing nodes, because among other things a full node would need 64GB of RAM.
Similarly, a pragmatic Bitcoin developer will see the potential for Antmain's exploitation of asicboost to have a massive centralizing effect on the mining market. Simple fix for that -- block asicboost.

What you mean to say is your preference is to invest in things that have a very low risk/reward profile.

@_date: 2017-07-07 15:23:43


Nobody would care if they freed the patent and every miner could use asicboost. But today, antmain may be using it covertly. Bad for bitcoin because it causes empty blocks and gives antmain a MASSIVE financial advantage which could lead to further centralization, because they can dump way more into R&amp;D than any other miner.


It seems to me that Segwit is the least rushed thing in he history of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:02:04
For those of you who are against it, I'm curious to get your reaction to this:
Antmain has a dangerous amount of mining influence. I don't believe they will voluntarily allow Segwit and give up their covert ASICboost advantage unless they get an equivalent or greater benefit in exchange, like control over development.
How do you propose dealing with such bad actors?
Though I don't like the option, the only option I see is BIP148. Status quo will only worsen the problem and strengthen Antmain's cartel. Something has to be done.
For what it's worth, I don't care either way about big blocks / small blocks. I have a slight preference for doing bigger blogs but later, when necessary, and bundled with some other cool HF-requiring features. What I care about most is checking Antmain's power.
Why? While I don't personally like Antmain or Jihan Wu, it's less the specifics that matter and more the fact that power is centralizing and this creates a vulnerability for Bitcoin. For example, in the outside chance that the Chinese Govt is calling the shots with Jihan, now you have a state actor that has massive control over Bitcoin. That's a bad scenario.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:18:25


As another poster said, the average actual segwit block is likely to be 2MB with the witness data being 1MB+ of that. Most miners will choose to validate and thus need the full block, but SPV nodes won't.
Also, this bandwidth increase is actually balanced out by the inclusion of Compact Blocks, which is expected to halve the bandwidth required.
I'm just guessing here, but the core contributors may not have pushed for Segwit *yet* without that counterbalancing improvement. They are taking a measured, responsible approach. In addition to saving bandwidth, there are other scaling benefits that come with Segwit too. Fixing the quadratic scaling issue actually makes it *safer* for future block size increase.

If you draw a trendline, you get to a 20-55k range by end of 2019.

I think you miss the point. Forget about Segwit for a moment. Let's separate the issues here. There are other ways to fix the market distortions caused by asicboost. Would you support those? Personally, I'd be okay with status quo too (and could be convinced to prefer it) if not for asicboost.
Do you understand how asicboost has the potential to distort the market to the point of creating a total monopoly on mining hardware? (And some would argue, already has?) It's not as simple as "people will use it." Who cares if some people use it. I care if Antmain uses it to harm the ecosystem for their benefit. For example, they can disable it on miners they sell and only use it on miners they run. They can sue other mining manufacturers who include it in their hardware. Etc.
If one company makes 100% of the miners, that's a massive point of failure for Bitcoin. Not hard to imagine the Chinese government installing a backdoor of some kind.

Big blocks don't get you there either unless you have HUUUGE blocks. We're at a few tx per sec and big blockers want 10k/sec like Visa, but that cannot be accomplished with big blocks. Why not just skip to the real solution, which is later 2? Why waste time on big blocks at all when you can reduce fees almost immediately with Segwit and schnorr sigs and have years to get LN and sidechain matured before the blocks fill up again? All with dramatically lower risk to the network?

I popped over to and it feels like over there. Sometimes I get a whiff of that same blind tribe mentality over here but it's not that strong. We need to do everything we can as a community to take the higher road and not throw insults back and forth.

your word salad is as meaningless as your orange god's.

Rather than write a response, I'll link to the most thoughtful article I know of that explains the other side of this. 
Curious to hear if this changes your opinion at all. I used to be a big blocker too.
Also, if we're at 7tps now and 1mb, we'd need 1.4gb blocks to do 10000tps.

It's simple. Like with certain politicians, there's a contingent of people that gravitate towards authoritarianism, disregard science, and are more vulnerable to propaganda. The problem is that a split would be awful for Bitcoin just like a secession would weaken the US. I'm actually feeling fairly confident at the moment, because threatening a defensive hard fork shows who he really is. Most of the businesses and exchanges in the Bitcoin space (the economic nodes) are ultimately run by very sane people. So I think good sense will prevail.

Every investment is a gamble. 
And it is not a zero sum game. 
My gosh, so many logical fallacies...

It's a car without a driver at this point. Not a matter of whether it happens, but what the fallout is. Or Segwit2x happens, in which case UASF was successful.

Agree, but when there is actual code to review things could change.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:15:57
Is that a threat?

Blocks already take too long to propagate, and by increasing their size you also make it much more difficult to mine via Tor.

That's what they said about BU. It took months to find the first crippling bugs. Testing isn't a box you check, it's a slow, thoughtful process that takes as long as it needs.
