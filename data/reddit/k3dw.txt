To be overly annoyingly mathematical, your specific example above would only work with 4 keys. Since 2 comments up you talked about 3 keys, I assume you meant 3, which would require a 16.7% overlap; 3 overlapping sections of 16.7% each and 3 independent sections of 16.7% each making a total of 100%.
I don't mean to put you down if that may be what you thought, I just want all the math to line up. ;)

Yeah of course. I mean there are probably infinitely many ways to make this type of thing happen, I just put out an idea of one of them.
I actually envisioned my semicircles analogy model having a pixel with anything that isn't total black recognized as white, just as in your post. I don't see why that couldn't happen. Would it not be possible to make another sheet of seeming randomness that creates the same QR code as the OP with each of the 2 original sheets?
EDIT: I may have misunderstood what you meant, so correct me if I'm wrong. :)

Oh that's incredibly cool, I look forward to it! I don't know very much about this stuff, it just seems amazing and sparks my curiosity :)

That blew me away, amazing!

Before I start, when I say *overlapping section* or anything like that, I mean *redundant information* and not a *physical overlap*, which obviously is the whole premise of this system.
So basically if you have 3 keys that each overlap with every other key, then you have *2x3 / 2 = 3* overlapping sections. This is calculated by knowing that each of 3 keys has 2 overlapping sections, but each of these sections is a result of 2 keys overlapping. On top of that there is a section of each key which is not overlapping, causing 3 more sections (6 total).
In all honestly, you could have all the keys have differing amounts of information and it would work. Even if they all have 50% information, you could still have different amounts of overlap, but if you want them to all be equal then just take 100% and divide it by the 6 sections, leaving ~16.7%. I think of this like 3 semicircles on top of each other. One at 0 degrees, one at 120, and one at 240. It divides the circle up into 6 sections, 3 of which are overlapping sections and 3 of which are not. With any 2 circles, you have 83% of the original circle.
For the 4 keys example of 25% overlap, I took it to mean that each key has redundant information with only 2 of the others. Adjacent keys would have, combined, 75% information but opposite keys would have 100% information. I think of this like 4 (you guessed it) semicircles overlapping, one at 0 degrees, one at 90, 180, and 270. Opposite semicircles have no overlap and therefore carry 100% of the information. Adjacent semicircles have half of their information overlapping, i.e. 25% of the entire circle. Together this is 75% of the total information. Thus any two keys would be able to create the QR code.

Yes, that *0, 120, 240* situation is for 3 keys. I only subdivided at those intervals because that it how to space out 3 semicircles equally.

Oh alright, that makes sense. With my circles analogy, I was basing myself on what was said a few comments up or so about QR codes being able to be used with missing information. Then you could have only 83% of the information with any 2 keys and it would still work. I have no idea how to design these keys, I just think that it would be possible.
So I guess changing the pattern is the way to go for a code with over 2 keys. Would smaller subpixels amount to more keys possible per code?
(I'm sorry for the ludicrously long discussion of this, I'm just super interested!)
