Yes, multi-platform is the direction this project is moving towards.  Take a look at the community Google+ group here -&gt; 
Ask any questions you like, share any ideas you have.  There are musicians, tech people, founder and devs sharing knowledge and information.

"registration and starting process is too complicated" - Don't know what to say, I found it very easy.  Leave feedback in the beta tester group. EDIT - I see you found your way there.  As for crashing, I use the app daily, rarely have crashes.  Possibly a phone OS issue.  The Devs have received your message.

The fans become your promoters/distributors and are given 50% of your earnings.    
You will be giving back to your fans, your fans earn for being a fan.  People who buy your music on other platforms get nothing but the music in return.

They are raising Bitcoin on Counterparty (Bitcoin Blockchain).  How is that NOT bitcoin related?

And... you may not see your percentage for a while. Most publishers pay-out up to 12 months after sale, but usually up to 6 months after sale

I was referring to percentages from an actual publishing/recording/distributor who returns percentages after initial costs and any advances paid, some number of months later.

"sirius" on the right, read the whitepaper and joined the project to develop Bitcoin,  he did the linux port from windows. It was his 1st c++ coding project (hence the not so clean code).  Sirius left the project in 2011 when the focus of the community went from freedom to finance (mining). He sold his bitcoins, bought an apartment and started working for someone else (and on his own projects). 
It's really worth listening through the vid a few times!

The music maker receives 50% and the other 50% goes to the distributer(s).  If the music is in the top 100, Bittunes gets 20%, music maker gets 40% and the distributer(s) get the other 40%.
There is a great infographic on Bittunes.org in menu 'user categories'.

Less chat.  Send some satoshi's (heh) from one of your early keys.
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:46:57
That percentage is larger than 'Most" standard publisher/distribution deals in the non-crypto world.  Google it for fun, you will be surprised how small a share the artist normally gets.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:21:10
This is as close as you will ever get to knowing the "truth".  There are some really good theories and one of them "is" correct. [1,1,1] + Sirius

A bitcoin wallet where you do not have to download and maintain a blockchain.  An intermediate (trusted) server has the full blockchain and can confirm and verify historical transactions on your behalf.  Think of it as having a 'Lite' bitcoin non-verifying node.

So the model is trained on historical data; Going forward the feature weights are adapted based on in-coming streaming data or are the feature weights adapted on an end-of-day basis?  Also is it just one primary model you have or an ensemble of models weighted in some manner?

"Canada Post tried to claim that my Mycelium Entropy was damaged in transit. Evidence suggests that it was opened by agents, as everything was done to make it appear that the device hadn't been opened. The tamper-seal is clearly broken and the package was carefully reassembled. Oh well. I guess I won't be using this device; I can't even plug this into a computer without concern, as someone might have added some malicious software. Too bad. I was really looking forward to using the Mycelium Entropy. I hope other people have had better luck"

Maybe because you DO NOT have sufficient price data to model ANY altcoin.  You cannot not create a PROFITABLE model because you will be modelling other BOTS and not human interaction in the markets.
