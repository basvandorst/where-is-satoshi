How can you tell how congested the network is?, is there a site that you can go to?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:03:45
Yep, I just got screwed by the exact same amount. 
My sister has yet to be verified on independent reserve (an Australian exchange) and I told her to just send me the $200 in BTC that she wanted to sell and that I would sell them for her. She couldn't use GDAX because for some reason she wasn't getting the authorisation SMS so she transferred them via the coinbase phone app.
I knew that the fees are currently high so I asked her to tell me what the total amount that was to be withdrawn and when I did the conversion I left out a '0' and got a AU$ figure of $4.71.
When she sent the BTC the amount her account was deducted was 
0.01330082 ($AU247 at the time) and the amount I received was 0.01104082 which works out to a 0.01330082 - 0.01104082 = 0.00226 fee (I calculated the fee using 0.000226).

I remember a similar post back in the early days where a guy was lamenting the fact that he bought several thousand dollars worth when bitcoin had hit $29AU (it was one of it's first major bear runs) before dropping back to $10AU or so and everyone felt really bad for him.

For years I had been trying to get my brother in law to mine bitcoins (pre boom) but he would brush it off as some kind of pyramid scheme. 
Just recently I almost had him convinced to install a Bitcoin ATM (a way of getting free publicity more than anything) in his newly renovated cafe, but a few minutes ago he called me to tell me of this drug bust and that there was no way he would install one as people would suspect he was into drug dealing.s

Well derrr. Seeing as most decent BYO plans (with around 4GB of data and unlimited SMS) here in Australia are about $40-$50 a month, I'd like to think of it as an interest free loan.
I am assuming that the US has similar plans, but with the added up front cost of the phone. My point is that we don't have an upfront charge and the difference between a BYO plan and one which a phone is included is less than the $1,000 it would cost to BYO phone.

Try mtred. It's pps, which means you get paid for every unit of work regardless of whether the pool finds a block or not. This is desirable if it is taking a long time to find a block because you still ger paid for every share that you submit. You will probably find no difference leaving deepbit on account of the sheer number of people in that pool and you are not paying 3% (mtred is free).
As for aoclbf?, it is better because it uses the latest version of poclbm. It also has done other really cool features that I can't think of off the top of my head, but the main reasons why I am using it is because: it's is supported and it solved a bug in the latest versio of guiminer.
@_date: 2012-02-24 08:38:42

Why of earth would you do that?. I am making an assumption here that people that know of, and understand the concept how bitcoins work, would also have some inkling about the inherent risks involved, especially when dealing with a company like PayPal . Up until last week, before TradeHill went under, I could sell my bitcoins and have the money in my account the very next day (2 days max depending upon what time of day I did the transaction)

I will stay on 2.4 SDK and may as well keep the current version as I am getting around 720GHS on my 6990 (stock) and from what I have read that is about the best I can expect unless I start overclocking.

Thanks for that. Will keep that in mind next time.  
Like I said the seller of the [last 6990 that went for $540]( had no receipts, so if something went wrong how would I identify the card?, do they have serial numbers or some other identifying labels?.
Also if you live in Sydney there are a couple of 5970's for sale that I was going to bid on, but I just noticed that the seller has [added a whole heap of other top notch bits and pieces]( which is going to push the price outside of my budget.

Aren't there block fees?. I had to pay 0.001 BTC to transfer 1BTC
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:02:16


I don't think any site can prevent that from happening. All they can do is to statistically analyse the betting pattern of players for anomalous betting patterns. I don't know how far poker bots have advanced since I tried writing one a few years ago (winholdem), but one thing you could look out for is the mouse clicks, both the interval and the XY coordinates of the click. Bots never click instantly, they need a few milliseconds to scrape the table and do the calculations and the response time is the same regardless of whether it is an auto-fold or a bet that a human would takes seconds to ponder. Humans clicking patterns are apparently very different to the methodical and predictable bot clicks.

Not everyone has the same metrics. I needed a new machine anyway and while I was never going to buy a high end card, I figured as long as I can make the depreciation on my card (I estimated it to be $200 on a 6990 that I bought for $790) then that's a win for me.

Gee, and I thought I was good at picking up on sarcasm. 
I did have some difficulty finding a 6990 in a bricks and mortar store (managed to track one down for $799 after about 10 phone calls), but I did find one online site that had several priced from $780-$840 but I didn't bookmark it. This is the [cheapest 6990]( that I could find, but it's on backorder.

Just in case some people aren't aware, google offers [2-Step-Verification]( so even if someone does get a hold of your unencrypted password, they still cannot access your account. Worth the hassle for that extra piece of mind.

Are you sure?. I thought the authenticator was like those keychain code generators that banks give you that generate a unique codes when you transfer money. Thats how it was explained to me. 
Also please explain why I had to print out those emergency codes that I have to use if I lose my phone?. If you are correct then all I would have to do is borrow someones phone and use that code. 
Surely they (google) could simply hash my phone number to generate a code unique to my account (that's what I would assume)
Will double check and edit my post if you are correct.
EDIT-Cannot find out if the code is unique or not, but I did find an [article]( which specifically states that an intruder cannot access you account even if he guesses your password.


If this is wrong can you please post a link where it specifically states that all the codes are synchronised (that is what I assume you meant in your post). I dont want to be under any false sense of security.

Wasn't so much the profit amount that I was questioning, but rather the % that was in the houses favour which the state is *over 98% breakeven odds*, but if you use their current counters, ie 2,380,548 coins bet vs 1,886,086 coins won the % comes out as %79.22. 
If you take 98% of the total amount of coins bet you get 2,332,937 not 1,886,086. I suspect what is happening is that people are not cashing out and, as some other people have said, they keep playing until they lose all their coins.
