Lol why do crypto needs plugins, still can’t figure out...
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:51:44
Now that's what I call "Mass adoption" xD
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:53:57
I'm not a Roger fanboy. But BCH technically is much better. Looks like WSJ did not read Satoshi's whitepaper
@_date: 2019-03-20 13:45:17
now let's go for Bitcoin stripclub

Thanks for detailed answer

 To become a certified plumber you need 2 years on average. 
To become a blockchain expert, you watch a 3-minute video on YouTube and then put "Blockchain Expert" on your LinkedIn.

Not sure whether scarce "commodity" like BTC can be used for IoT transactions.
Also, BTC privacy is a big no-no for businesses. Nobody wants their enterprise data to be visible.
Right now I have these blockchains in mind:
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:48:13
IOTA 
IoT Chain 
 Factom 
Ambrosus 
VeChain 
Power Ledger 
Waltonchain 
Helium 
OriginTrail 
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:15:05
I mean the blockchain itself. Like I want to build let's say an IoT Dapp on top of it. Which should I consider: NEO, EOS, ETH, VET, IOTA and so on.
Maybe smbd has some experience to share...

marketing not good?
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:30:33
Great list! Bookmarked some of them.
You can also add cryptojobslist.com and cryptocurrencyjobs.co
Personally, I have a positive experience with those 2!
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:45:36
Why no Bitcoinnects appearing? Where's Matos hiding? Where's Borys crypto (moneys and partys)
This industry is so boring on this bull run... 
I miss old times
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:29:16
That’s actually hard ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:33:00
Absolutely if you aren’t trading for a living. Then selling now is a stupid idea
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:32:24

@_date: 2019-06-26 16:02:31
As far as I understand LTC is completely useless coin. Why it’s ranked so high?
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:24:02
So how can I stay calm and educate my ignorant ass if there's bull running everywhere? :)
I need profits NOW
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:12:13

@_date: 2019-06-27 04:43:27
Not that easy as it seems, but I’ll try to :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:24:48
DYOR :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:54:13
Sounds a bit overwhelming :(
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:56:38

@_date: 2019-06-26 10:57:01

ETH also looks nice to me from my short experience
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:54:10

MY WIFE STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ME...
@_date: 2019-04-18 08:24:39
Many opinions out there. But all point that csw is scammer. I'm just an average dude who is trying to figure out things
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:57:56
He's wife probably not
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:47:55
absolutely agree. Accessibility of BTC to the world is insane, so can be its marketcap
