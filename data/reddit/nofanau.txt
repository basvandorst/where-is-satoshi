It was the first day I prison and my cell mate started over at me.
“What are you in for?”, he murmured curiously looking at me.
I was a talk lean skinny guy rocking square glasses , not the typical hardened criminal you’d expect to end up here.
I looked up wondering where I had gone wrong in life.
“I’m on a felony charge for 2 counts of selling bitcoins to minors at an inflated price”... I sighed.
He broke into a maniacal laugh staring at me.
“What are you in for then?”
“Oh me? I created a Ponzi scheme of a coin and got extradited from Japan”, he replied.
“Roger? Is that you?” I burst out.

They’re all pretty similar in Aus at the time of writing this btcmarkets is actually cheaper than CoinJar and Acx.
If you look at  you can see the Australian exchanges are overpriced but definitely not the worst, the Korean ones take the prize!
If I had to guess I’d say it’s down to the verification might be more specific on Aud exchanges , so mostly only aussies can trade, also with the current issue of unconfirmed transactions you can’t really move bitcoin between exchanges and wallets atm.
So there is a limited amount of bitcoins on exchanges that are doing the Aud/BTC pair. Local demand is going up , probably spoke to 9 co workers today about bitcoin and the supply just isn’t their.
This is all speculation however I have seen that the Aus exchanges typically trade a bit higher and when it’s very volatile it can be anywhere between 1-10% higher , this changes every few minutes.

Are you planning to trade or buy and hold?
If you’re just buying and hodl use any of the big ones. The price fluctuates so much it doesn’t really matter.
For trading I like btc markets because my fees are really low because I’ve traded enough. I’m also a fan of their support and the interface works well. No mobile app yet but it’s meant to be coming soon.
I also started off coinbase then moved my coins to btcmarkets then for what I’m holding long term into cold storage. ( order yourself a trezor or an alternative).
I would review the fee structure of each site you’re looking at for trading and for security read the faq and terms then go from there.
In terms of verification for btc, it was quick for me pretty much instant and POLi limit is 2k per deposit but happens almost instantly.

No , it gets asked every day on here. Going into debt into something volatile is super risky. Yes things are going well now for bitcoin, yes I think they will still rise. 
But what happens if you suddenly have to pay back that loan during a bitcoin dip or a correction? 
If you want to invest in bitcoin badly , save more money, don’t buy coffee from Starbucks just make it , go out for dinner less, watch alll your Netflix shows and cancel it for a month.
Not only does this help you save but you’re not going into debt.

I mean take that advice with a grain of salt , the running theory was bitcoin cash was going to crash when GDAX/coin base enabled it.
So who knows it could moon like crazy again? Time will tell, I’m holding some bitcoin cash I picked up at a much cheaper price and I’m trying to figure out my next move.

People have such high level of entitlement towards bitcoin prices. 
“I bought at 15k, why is it not 50k yet?” 
Or 
“I bought at 15k and it’s now 14k, this sucks”
Or finally 
“I bought at 15k and it’s now 20k, I am the greatest investor of them all!”.
Markets fluctuate , bitcoin is volatile , risk vs reward , this is pretty damn high risk in my books

It looks so pretty
