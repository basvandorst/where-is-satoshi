Honestly I don't blame them at all.  They probably have developed some very in demand skills during their time developing it and now they can get some really good jobs.  Maintaining a wallet is a very daunting and I imagine somewhat scary in the "What if x happens" category-- that alone would stop me from attempting.  
Wallet software should begin to start being developed by real professional company's.  They've proven hard to monetize but as Bitcoin goes up the less people are going to want to rely on a company with actual revenue figures to be responsible, rather than some poor guys who tried to help the community. 
kinda high and forgot where i was going with this so ill just leave it there.

I doubt you spent your bitcoin at farmers market. They didnt use bitcoin very much at all if at all.  Briefly explain what the farmers market was like and we'll quickly know if youre bulshitting because theres a possibility of perhaps a particular vendor using it
