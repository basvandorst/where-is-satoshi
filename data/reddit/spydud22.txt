Well yeah its just funny. Reddit is a circle jerk in general. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 02:19:04
ebay and paypal are scams. Their "sellers protection" policy is useless and bullshit. I could just order and pricey thing off ebay and smash it with a hammer. Complain that the mail did it, and get my money back. It happened to me.

@_date: 2017-08-18 20:08:47

Yes you are right that would be a more suitable enemy.
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:08:07
Bing took a hold of me by the force you speak of. I couldn't resist and I wasn't asking for it.

True it will work in a hurry. Fees give me nightmares still haha
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:57:56
Add another 0 on to your budget and now you're talking. Probably get banned for saying this but Altcoin mining could be your best bet with your current budget.
@_date: 2015-10-05 12:40:34
Anything over 4Th/s sure but anything under and its not worth it. MAYBE 2 th/s for hobby purposes.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:05:47
