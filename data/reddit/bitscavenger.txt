I would not trust the API search on that page.  Those were user entered and a lot of people did not fill in the tech stacks that they were using because many of us were rushing to register our projects after 24 hours of coding and over 30 hours of being awake.  I was there and watched ~20 teams present to chain.com.  The presentations were on a timer happening simultaneously with all sponsors so when chain.com was done there was 2-3 more teams to go for blockchain.info and all the other sponsors were long done.  I definitely trust Blockchain's count and would certainly trust their word and mine over the user entered project tagging.

You still need to trust that exactly.  He is printing the private key and embedding it which means he had it at one time.  The only thing you don't have to trust is that you sent him bitcoin and he would not charge or send your product.  He has shown over and over that he is good about that though.

How does it matter what they raise to determine valuation?  They determined valuation already.  When MS bought 5% of facebook for $1 billion they determined the valuation was $20 billion (not the real numbers).  When I buy .0004% of the total viable safecoin for $480 the valuation is $120 million.  I think I am allowed to take total supply into account if I am also planning to hold 10 years.
I suppose if they don't sell what they need and are forced to lower the price then it lowers the valuation.

Shill warning.  I am currently running an Indiegogo campaign for a physical bitcoin solution here [Numisalis](
One of the main concerns I am trying to address is people who do not want to make the rather large effort of securing their own bitcoin.  While it would be cheaper for them to make their own paper wallet, my solution has the built in benefit of them being able to easily trade it without converting it back to a digital wallet.  I am doing that by keeping coin denominations small and manageable.
Again, I realize I am pushing my product, but I really believe in it.

My guess would be that licensed money transmitters do not like Bitcoin.  Logically the first one to cross the line would have first mover advantage on something that might be inevitable, but then the answer might be that large organizations do not change business models.  There are too many people who can say no to new ideas.

4. Paid for by the seller which is in turn paid for by the CONSUMER.  Cashback is a manipulation of incentives to get people to force merchants to accept credit cards.  But this system is 0 sum.  Sellers don't magically have more money to pay CC companies, they get it from their customers so they can stay in business.
The same incentive manipulation also occurs with bitcoin in the form of discounted prices.
Edit: (not sure how to get that number to say 4)

@_date: 2014-12-24 16:46:17
I generally agree with your sentiments.  I say just keep it natural.  I was at my local comic book shop and I wanted a snack from their snack bar.  It was $1.  I looked in my wallet and no cash.  I didn't buy it because using a credit card would have ended up costing them money even though they said they would let me.  So I dropped the old "you don't take bitcoin do you?"  They did not.
It was a viable solution to an immediate problem and it got one cashier explaining to the other what bitcoin was.  Bitcoin is great and there are plenty of natural ways to introduce people to it.  The opportunities keep cropping up on their own.

The coins are designed for trade.  I realize that people can put less or more than the denomination in the address but hopefully people will read the notice on the coin to verify the amount on the address and will take the time to use my app to verify that I made the coin.
Denominations are written on the coin because I believe that facilitates trade.  Psychologically people are more willing to deal with things that give them cues toward quick understanding.  A blank coin is easy to just reject and not look deeper.  A denominated coin may require the same effort to verify but the person accepting the coin has a reasonable expectation she can verify instead of putting verification and value discovery in the same step.

Fungible property like cash which is what we were talking about?  Yes.  It always happens all the time ad infinitum.  Full culpability lies with the thieves and they should be made to pay it all back.  It cannot be reasonably identified as unique to an illegal situation so no special effort should be made to attempt to identify it.  But what is so great about fungible items is they are easy to replace by any party.  We were not talking about non-fungible property to which I think you are starting to allude.  To that, no.  Like a pawn shop, the barterer should be at a loss when the owner identifies the property and reclaims it.  And like a pawn shop the barterer should not go to prison.  It is the risk inherent in the business not a criminal act.  It is also a risk most pawn shops take knowing most stolen items will not be claimed.
I also do not like the way the criminal justice system spends all their efforts making sure people "pay back society" and almost no effort making sure the victims are made right.  We find it more expedient to put people into prison than to actually right wrongs.
Now I say this knowing there are flaws with allowing people to barter for stolen property.  It isn't a perfect answer.  But it seems like when you are bartering cash, the only time this law could possibly put into effect is when police are trying to bust you for something because they don't like something else that you are doing.  Seriously, how else would this possibly be provable outside of a sting?

If you are saying that the influence that people are using to fight money laundering is leveraging collateral damage then I am all for taking their influence away as well.  Neither side should say "I am willing to hurt all of these people if I don't get my way."  Right now, both sides say it.
But then I also don't agree with systems that allow so few people to make decisions that hurt so many.  I will admit I don't know the full ramifications of a society not keeping vigilant track of everyone's money.  We used to not but I don't know necessarily how bad that was.

It does not detect where you are, you are just responsible for putting in the extra money for shipment outside the US.  I am fairly certain when accounting for shipping and everything else, this is the best deal you can get for a physical coin though I will admit that metal is a nice piece to have if you are looking for a collector's item.
Also, I wanted to correct your logic.  100mBTC is 0.1BTC.  That is ~$84.  The 1mBTC coin is $0.84.  The perk states that you can change the coins you get.  I default to 100mBTC just because it is a low margin mint, but you can choose anything from the 1mBTC, 5mBTC, 10mBTC, 25mBTC, 50mBTC, and 100mBTC.  Whatever suits your fancy.

I really like your post.  It makes sense of several things I have been worried about.  Distributed crypto-currency will always be worth a lot just like the internet.  That will manifest in maybe a couple actual currencies.  The winners will be the ones with the best support.  There is a crypto-currency bubble, there has to be, people will always make bubbles out of the hot new thing.  But that does not mean there is a Bitcoin bubble.  The predominant bubble activity is in the altcoins
If anything, it makes me appreciate the altcoins.  While I don't think Bitcoin will ever escape manipulation and periods of being oversold, keeping the crazy speculators involved in altcoin is probably very healthy for Bitcoin.

As someone who invests in a lot of different things (commodities, stock, real estate) I can say that I have had a lot of eye opening experiences dealing with bitcoin over the years.  Direct access to markets, speed of transfer, ability to control it myself, great fungibility.
I am definitely a power user and in the minority as far as my interests and abilities but there are things about bitcoin that are just not present in these combinations with other resources.
I don't pretend that there are things fiat and CC and fractional reserve do better, but there is absolutely a place for bitcoin.

I am investing completely on the basis of "I want it to work."  My biggest question is how performant will the network be?  Is what they are saying going to be true in the real world?  I will be oh so happy to use it if it is usable.
Also, if you are looking at investing, here is some quick guidance:
21 million BTC
4.3 billion safecoin
17,000:1 SFC to BTC
Bitcoin = $480
Safecoin = $0.0232
So they are valuing the Safecoin technology at ~$121 million right now.  Lots of other factors come into play for timed trading, but long term that is about what it means.  If you think the business world built around Maidsafe will be worth more than that then it is a good investment.

Which is why I don't like the regulation btw.  Regulation can protect people from scams, but they can also be used to arbitrarily keep power in the hands of the powerful.  Before you could argue that regulation was the only reasonable way to protect ordinary people so was necessary, but now it is arguable that cryptography and statistics can offer better protection with less overhead so regulation does little more than stifle fair competition.

I would recommend 2 circuits yes.  Definitely if it is a 15 amp circuit.  When it comes to electricity Power = Voltage * Current.  US circuits are 110V (really a shame).  So if power = 1000 watts then current draw is 1000/110 or 9.09 Amps.  If they are both on the same circuit there is 18.18 Amps going through the breaker.  If you are on a 240V circuit then the current draw is less than half that.  I tried running both on a 20Amp circuit.  It ran fine.  The issue is that 110V is not guaranteed.  If voltage drops a bit the machine draw spikes the amperage (if I am getting this all correctly).
I will say that the internals of this machine are impressive.  The power supplies are very tolerant.  The power hookups are sturdy and the boards are fed by very low gauge wires.  They did not cheap out on the components and I think this unit will prove to be pretty rugged.

I was at work and talked about some theoretical thing I did not know existed.  A coworker said, "that sounds a little like Bitcoin."  I looked it up and and then looked into it because of how stupid it sounded.  I like making fun of things.  In fairness, my first introduction from a internet "expert" in Bitcoin was absolutely horrible.  He said "think of it like a briefcase full of cash" but did not qualify those remarks with any support.  Two days later I had done my research and was  getting money to Gox.  Two weeks later I had my GPU mining rig running.  I still don't think fondly of my coworker for knowing about bitcoin months before and not telling me then when we talked about this kind of stuff all the time.  I would have gotten sub dollar coin and would be working full time on bitcoin projects funded by my own money right now.

Math does not support your last supposition.  Competition will decrease profit margin whether the fees are there or no.  If fees are paid they will certainly not drive a business to negative profit margin or the business would cease.  That difference will always be made up by charging consumers more.
Your second supposition suggests a surrender to the current state of an anti-competitive market.  Bitcoin is great because I can hand my money to someone else and there is no third party or regulation that can stop me.  Supposing that things have gotten very draconian, an entity could do something to me later as punishment, but they can't actually stop the transaction from happening or place themselves in the middle to collect a fee.  Thinking things are not draconian, and knowing bitcoin can be used to pay someone I don't have to make physical contact with I may now always choose to cut out businesses built on anti-competitive strategies.  To me that is what makes bitcoin great.  It is the power of removing the middle man.  I can do direct transactions to someone I will never meet.  Large players will try to "make things simple" and charge fees.  That is what BitPay does.  More power to them.  But they will always be competing against the Bitcoin protocol which give people a "free" option that makes their service a non-necessity.

FirstBits will be visible from the outside of the coin.  NFC will hold the full public address and a confirmation code.  It will never have the private key.  Full public address will be useful if FirstBits are not working on the regular services (blockchain.info), verification code will be a hash plus secondary destructive algorithm against the public address.  That will just ensure that the person who made the coin was me.  Private key will only be available by breaking open the coin and reading the printed private key from the embedded card stock.  The only central party dependency is the verification code declaring I made the coin.  There will never be any hindrance for the coin's possessor to redeem the bitcoin back to the blockchain.

This is splitting hairs, but I don't think it is accurate at all to say "Right now it will be x in 10 years."  We are paying right now, and we have a very reasonable claim to know the future of the supply as well as the release rate.  Things will shift based on immediate demand/scarcity models on a day to day basis but if you are planning long term you can fairly say I am buying y% based on what the known supply will be in the future.  No one is more long term than Maidsafe.  Therefore they are valuing their tech at $121 million RIGHT NOW.  I, for one, do not think that is entirely unreasonable.

Sure, but all we are doing is complaining about it and theorizing while it is actually happening.  What I am trying to say is that if the Bitcoin economy was more robust, then it would not matter if AML laws passed or not for the honest and the dishonest.  Banks could blacklist and Mr Fuad could still do international business.  While it does nothing to stop the poppy trade, it does remove the collateral effect that corrupt officials wield.
I would prefer a society where corrupt officials had that bit of leverage taken away from them so that they could not use their own people as a playing piece in the international power game.  Again it goes back to my belief that you can solve non-technical solutions with technology because technology allows you to change the game.

I think the way it would have to work is that you find general areas where you can recognize a pattern and assign an integer to that area.  Then you combine those areas into one integer for hashing.  Then you don't have to be exact, you just have to have software that will always subdivide the image based on the same patterns.  That is much more doable.  Depending on the resolution of your pattern grid, that is where you have to find the balance between guaranteeing absolutely uniqueness and guaranteeing that every picture taken of it will produce the same result.

From what they have told me, and this is in the press release, they are ramping production and shipping today.  They did not disclose to me how fast they will get through the December batch.
So the picture on the press release is from Friday.  Because of snowmagedon 2014 in Austin the FCC certification did not make it through on Friday.  I got my picture taken, saw the box, and then had to leave without it because they could not legally give it to me.  Kind of a tease but they have been super helpful ever since then and, hell, I was still getting the first one so its kind of hard to bitch about it.

Most credit card fees are x + y%.  So it would be more like 10 cents plus 3.5%.  Also you did not take into account that these CC fees do not include gateway fees.  Merchants to not have direct access to banks or the CC company.  That is another 25-40 cents.  Then you have to remember that sandwich was not free for the merchant.

One thing that helps my mental model for offline wallets is this.  You don't possess any bitcoin.  No one does.  If someone asks, where is your bitcoin the truth is that it is on the blockchain.  All bitcoin exists on the blockchain.
What you possess is a key that can be used to move bitcoin from one address to another.
That is why brainwallets work.  A key is just any 256-bit number.  If you have a phrase that can reliably be transformed into the same 256-bit number, for instance by sha256 hashing it, then that phrase is your key.  If you move your bitcoin to the corresponding address then you have a reliable process to access your bitcoin even if every computer you have ever touched simultaneously gets destroyed in a fire.
I will definitely caution against brainwallets, however.  If you move your bitcoin to an address made from a brainwallet, there is nothing stopping people from trying to guess your phrase and doing the same thing to access your bitcoin and there are plenty of people doing this all day with very fast machines.  They don't need access to your computer because your bitcoin is not located on your computer, they just need access to the blockchain.

The issue with it is that you can't trade the bitcoin to someone else.  Well, you can, but you have to give that person the passphrase.  Not that it has to be kept a secret, but it is annoying for the person you are giving the coin to.

Exactly.  It would probably also be denominated so you should only put the correct amount of bitcoin in that wallet.  But technically you could also add bitcoin to prefunded wallets to throw it off.
The real point is that the secret key is kept hidden so you can transfer full possession of the address by transferring physical possession of the key.

I am actually going to be posting a bitcoin related Indiegogo campaign tomorrow (if all goes well).  I have given a lot of thought to the idea of accepting bitcoin for a crowdfunded campaign.  Bitcoin is great for instant payment but it really kind of stinks for deferred payment.  It was crappy enough pre-paying for a ASIC with bitcoin and that is immediate payment.  It makes things worse when payment is delayed for a month.
So if value of bitcoin drops and you are collecting money to pay suppliers that do not take bitcoin then do you collect funds that you know won't cover your project.  What about the alternative where the value spikes.  This is a crowdfunding campaign where you are very grateful for people giving you money to achieve your dream.  Do you just say "thank you suckers" for the extra funds you raised or do you kill yourself trying to give back in some way to your valuable first customers?
Bitcoin is great, but you really need a special business model for deferred bitcoin payment to make sense.

The difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks.  Typically this takes 14 days.  If hashing power halves after a difficulty change then average block finding will happen every 20 minutes and it will take 28 days for this problem to be fixed.
Alt coins have been outright killed by this.  90% hashrate decline and the rest of the miners have to work for 140 days to readjust the difficulty.  You get no benefit of the reduced global hashing power until the difficulty changes.  Because of that and 100 minute confirmation times an additional 90% of that remaining 10% leaves and difficulty does not adjust for 1400 days and confirmation times take 1000 minutes (over 16 hours).  Then everyone abandons it.
The bitcoin community is to large and strong to make this scenario feasible but it is possible and has happened to smaller communities.

That is the point.  It is a tradable item.  And the point is to also trade bitcoin.  If you want to trade silver then trade silver.  If you want to trade bitcoin then trade bitcoin.  You are looking for a collector's item which there are plenty of places that make that already.  I want a cheap item where the materials and production stop undercutting the value of the bitcoin.

Having a floor for the value does not mean much.  The floor is a false promise.
Gold could be worth nothing if all it had was industrial value because the cost of owning gold (storing it, moving it, protecting it) can negatively contribute to whatever value it may have.  Lead has uses but the detriments of holding it make it pretty worthless to all but the few people who need it.
I personally like the fact that the value of Bitcoin is not muddled by having to take into account other uses (though that is becoming less of a reality).  Other people may not like that property but I think there is a purity to it.
That said I think the point is gold is valued because it has a lot of desirable and unique property combinations and that is not going away.  Bitcoin can be judged on the same criteria.

That is true currently.  There are 2 power supplies and they pull about 1kW each.  I have seen my hash rate jump around between 1.55 TH and 2TH but it seems to hover at around 1.7 most of the time.  I have been told that they decided to release before they did some extra tweaking with firmware instead of holding until everything was just perfect.
They are still optimistic that tweaks made will bring power consumption down and hash rate up.  They would not give me a delivery time on these and it is still a promise and not an in hand thing.  I don't know if their original goal is something that will happen but I don't see any reason things won't get better.
I definitely have an advantage of having visited their offices and getting to know some of them.  It is overwhelming their dedication to doing right by their customers.  But out of hand you don't really have a reason to believe me more than them.

And roughly 20 teams used the chain.com API including myself.  Blockchain and chain.com were 2 of the 9 sponsor APIs and had roughly 40% of the teams programming with their APIs.  Point being, it was a good day for Bitcoin.  It probably helps that it is open programmable money.  Something about that appeals to programmers :).
EDIT: in addition there were a handful of teams that used Blockchain.info but also another sponsor's API and so they submitted under the other sponsor because each sponsor could only choose 3 teams to send to the next round of judging.

Much like Casascius, I am really just going to have to count on people's trust.  Most third party risk is negligence and lack of security from outside risk and not willful intent.  I can absolutely counteract negligence and outside risk by meticulously destroying everything about the secret keys that is not needed.  And I will do that because it is in my own interest.  My process will be to generate all the keys on a machine that never touches the internet and to physically destroy the media after I have created a large batch of keys for printing.  Currently I am thinking of just using a raspberry pi for that.  SD cards are cheap enough to destroy after single use.
As for trusting me, the most I can really do is let people know who I am.  I won't steal from you because I won't get away with it.
I have read up on schemes (mostly made by Mike Caldwell) where the secret key is encrypted by a pass phrase that the owner knows.  That way, Mike is incapable of stealing the secret key.  The problem with that is the pass phrase must travel with the coin.  The main purpose of the coin is to be tradable and to give the possessor unhindered access to the bitcoin.  If anyone knows of a scheme to make the secret key unknown to me when I generate it yet still make it complete enough to travel with the coin so physical possession is all that is required I am all ears.  I would definitely do that in a heartbeat.

I now have 2 miners.  The miner that I got in January is much less stable than the one I got at the end of March.  The speed is the same but the January one crashes a couple of times a day.  I monitor and have automatic restarts so there is not much downtime.  From a dollar standpoint I have not made my money back but that is mostly about the current conversion rate.  The plan is to sell none of them for several years at least.  My purchase of a miner has met my expectations for bitcoin output but that has really been guided by my expectations of the rise in difficulty.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:19:50
I would not underestimate the power of debt.  I assume that most large mining operations would be able to find money to keep operations going collateralized against their bitcoin and hardware.  The whole investment market is about borrowing money for future returns (was not always but pretty much is entirely now).
So they find someone who believes that bitcoin will return to a higher purchasing power and use their money to keep crunching.  The ones that go out of business are the ones that can't convince an investor to put more money in.

Solo mining isn't really an option.  I believe the expected time under the current difficulty for finding a block with this is just over 2 months.  The problem is that in 2 months that will have been extended to 4 months.
I will try to get some pics/vids. My apologies for not having these yet, most of my time has been setting up the machine and I don't work where the machine is hosted so I will have to wait to get access again.
Right now payouts should be great but I have been working through kinks.  Although it was never stated, part of being customer  is troubleshooting the first product running in the real world.  Nothing earth shattering but I have found some config bugs and I have been taking the machine down often to help reproduce issues and try different setups for Cointerra.  I consider that bit of work and help worth it because I get a direct line to Engineering for any future problems :).

Good on you!  I for one had no idea that a stable price for bitcoin in January was going to be $800.  I remember when it got up to $350 in November and I was like "holy shit, that is awesome".  Even then I did not think $1000 was reasonable that year.  I will admit that every price prediction I made has been pretty piss poor.  I told my dad that $47 was a little hot and I would wait for it to go down before buying.  It has never seen that price since.

But that is something that OT can do.  Distributed currency exchange and your deposits can be put into a voting pool so something can be set up so that who you deposit to cannot touch your coin.  it has to be voted on in the pool and the proof is your signature.  The risk is collusion or the third party falsifying that it only owns a minority vote in the pool, but there are a lot of people in Bitcoin that started out as good hearted trustworthy people and this gives them a system to avoid corruption or stupidity.

Need is an incorrect word.  The app is completely value add.  There is nothing preventing you from using the coin without it.  If FirstBits are working somewhere you can verify the value of the FirstBits.  If you have an NFC reader you can get the full public address and verify the value of that address.  All my app does is provide a quick way to verify the value of the coin and ALSO provides a service that verifies I am the one who made the coin.  What I have found out with FirstBits not working anywhere is my Casascius coins can't even be validated without the order email telling me the full address.  My coin works better than that without my app and even better again with it.

Maybe I am alone but this seems like really bizarre logic.  When did it become my responsibility to police my peer especially after the fact?  It is just some idiot who could be lying to me.  In the case where it is a sting, it actually is an idiot lying to you.  The money he got really wasn't stolen credit card proceeds.
And this whole thing seems bass-akwards.  This was not a sting to see who would be willing to do business with someone who sold credit card data, it was targeting bitcoin and the idea that bitcoin traders need a money transmitter license.  If that is the case, why even lie about stolen credit card data?  Trumped up charges?  Or is it that they are trying to provide a reason why this person should be licensed as a money transmitter?
Morally, I would prefer to not help out people who stole credit card data but it seems a reach to tell people to blacklist money or you get prosecuted for a crime.  Confiscation as punishment and the risk of confiscation should be enough of a disincentive.  If they are telling you about the future illegal activity you are enabling (aka, I am going to buy stolen credit card data with THIS bitcoin) then I see that as a better argument.

Good system.  I think I am more along the track of investment though.  Bitcoin, like fiat, burns a hole in my pocket.  And not for spending either.  Maybe fiat just has me trained to do this, but I can't stand to see money just sit.  There are higher purposes for that.  There are things that can be done.  But nothing gets done if money put to one purpose just gets lost or stolen.
Take crypto trade markets for example.  I want to hold money in a market so I can move on new information, but I don't want to trust other people to hold my crypto as time and again they prove to not be trustworthy.  Typically the common answer was, you risk one to gain the other.  But OT can be used so that I can have the convenience and greatly reduce the risk.

Are you suggesting a system where I would not have access to the secret key?

If I had purchased bitcoin at the time I purchased the miner I would have 100 bitcoin.  I expect that by December this miner will have mined 50 bitcoin.  That may be way off, but it is my assumption.  That was not my calculation when I bought it.  I did not expect difficulty to continue ramping as it did.
But I also mine for the fundamental values of it.  It is the best way I know to have a voice in Bitcoin.  I also did not think there was a great way to convert cash into bitcoin.  Looking back, localbitcoins would have been the best.  But I don't want to register with exchanges and provide documentation proving who I am.  I think banks really overreach their bounds on that and I am not a terribly libertarian person.  Mining original coin is a way to keep that kind of thing down.  I don't ever assume my privacy is secure because of this but at least I am not jumping through hoops I consider inane.

I will be printing firstbits because I think that is a service too valuable to be down forever.  But you can scan the NFC tag which will yield the full public address and you can check that.  If you use the smartphone app I will release, it will scan the coin, ping blockchain.info for the bitcoin value and will also ping bitcoinaverages for the fiat value.  Those two services can be easily replaced with an update if something ever happens to them.

If you look at Bitpay you will know the answer is no.  They will give you the fiat of your choice.  Or bitcoin if you choose.  Or any percentage combination of fiat and bitcoin.  You pay your $30 charge and there is literally nothing else for you to worry about unless you WANT to hold bitcoin.
And why would costs go up for payment processing?  Possibly competition to be included in a confirmation block but if you are talking about processors, when has an increase in volume ever made unit cost higher?
In another comment you made "great perks are paid for by businesses" so the user gets these perks for free.  Well the truth is nothing is free for the customer.  They are in business and they make money.  It not made out of thin air.  In the end the cost is always passed to the customer in the form of higher prices.  That is why when dealing with bitcoin, merchants can lower prices.

I have 2 miners.  They require some babysitting.  They require that I go above and beyond keeping them cool and that is no easy task.  That said, one has been running for almost 3 months and one has been running almost a month and there has been no degradation in performance.  Both of these machines have run in less than ideal environments.  My biggest complaint is that I feel like I have purchased elephants.  It's awesome to have an elephant but I was not originally prepared for how much they would eat.  I just accept that as my fault though.
Also, there is no way Cointerra is in the same ballpark as BFL.  I have dealt with both.  BFL is non-responsive and completely incompetent.  I have never had a request from Cointerra take a long time to resolve and I just go through their support channel on their website.

I posted earlier and I seemed to get some attention and some people agreeing with me that this was a pretty good idea.  I am definitely getting down to the wire on this.
The summary is a physical bitcoin that is durable, low margin, low denomination, and quicker and easier to verify than current offerings.  In other words it is a coin meant to be TRADED and not just collected.  I think it is something that can really help the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Hopefully a big reason for the lack of pre-order donations is that is that you did not want your money held for 30 days while the campaign completed.  Well, now it is only 11 days so please feel free to donate knowing that if I don't make it you will get all your money back soon.

Let's say you find someone to trade your tons of lead to (because no one else will want your insanity death impossible to move stuff).  Will he/she have what you need to trade with you?

If gold were just industrial use it would be a heavy pain in the ass.

I am proposing that the method is useful even when well known.  Security through obscurity is easy enough if you can remember a set of processes ie. 1) have a pass phrase (could be well known) 2) alternate characters substituting for one character higher and one lower until you get to the end 3) hmac-512 with that as your message and your last name as the key 4) remove the first and last 2 characters 5) sha256 hash that value to get your secret key.
If you just tell yourself that is your process and don't share it with anyone I don't think it will be discovered by attack.

It would be best to store it in a cooler room.  The liquid cooling keeps the processors very cool but they can only cool to the ambient temp of the room and the cooler it is in the room the better the system can keep cool.  It does warm the room pretty well on its own.  I think the highest temp we saw was 80 deg C. and the room was ~75 def F.  Sorry for the differing scales but it is the way I think about things.  We asked about max operating temp and they said that the miner will shut itself down if a proc reaches 95 C.  They said that temp is still safe for the proc but there should not be a reason it reaches that temp.
And yes, the web GUI will show the core temps.

Downer time.  I don't understand the problem you are solving.  I don't understand how this has anything to do with bitcoin because you could substitute USD and it seems to make no difference.  You say like coinmap but with higher data throughput.  Who says the data throughput will be any higher?  Who is creating that data?  Why are they creating that data?  Is the data refreshing faster because you expire the data?  Is that more annoying than useful to your content providers?
I was in a startup that worked with food establishments (restaurants and cafes).  These people can't be bothered to update their online menu most of the time.  It is frustrating.  Keeping track of real time offerings on a secondary service is 99% a no go.
My opinion, definitely more compelling on the odd job/uber front but I don't see anything that makes bitcoin an obvious choice over cash.
Don't give up on your dream, but ask yourself really tough questions and have an answer for people like me.  Best of luck!

I am aware of the service but I don't think it is a good use for bitcoin yet unless you have a very specialized business.
ASIC hardware companies showed us how much it sucks just to prepay for things with bitcoin.  Not having access to the bitcoin for ~35 days is even worse.  What if bitcoin dropped 20% in 35 days.  Then I didn't raise enough money and now I am sitting with people's money and I don't have a clear path forward.  What if it goes up 20%?  That is a better situation but still not entirely fair to people buying in who have to wait a long time for their product.
I knew about this service and thought long and hard about using them.  In the end I just thought it was too risky to have an opportunity to be successful and still fail.  I may be proven completely wrong.  It just did not seem to fit my business plan.  I love Bitcoin and for instant payments I think there is nothing better.  Not so much for accounts receivable.  Not yet.

I probably agree with you, I feel like I hold consensus metric to a higher standard than what is legitimately part of its definition in this case in which case I am wrong about that.  I don't think I am wrong about anything else I said.  And in this case I would still say BU does not remove blocksize as a consensus metric, it is just that the metric adjusts to vote instead of being consensus by fiat.  No doubt it will change the dynamic that could prove detrimental to miners who are not constantly paying attention in the form of lost work but miners should always be held to the highest standard of having to pay attention.

It seems like every story here can pretty much be summed up as: "I actually took the time to learn about it."  People will dismiss Bitcoin as a ponzi scheme until they have the proper motivation to learn about it themselves.  Unfortunately, meeting people where they are when they are motivated to learn about it is difficult.  There are plenty of "educated" people who have no idea how their money works and have no experience with how cumbersome doing things with money can be.

How does any of this make sense?  When was block size ever a consensus metric?  It is an arbitrary hard coded limit put in place for spam safety.  It is never about consensus it is a matter of client rejection.  If it was adjustable it might actually become a consensus metric.  But merkel tree don't care about block size.  Blocksize limit is a client setting.  BU can't force a smaller blocksize unless miners can create a highest difficulty chain with their limit imposed and they would do that the same was as they could do it now, by making their own self imposed smaller blocks.  And the massive blocksize limit hurting lightweight nodes also does not make sense.  Lightweight nodes grab block headers as routine and grab block data as needed.  Merkel trees make the storage needs a log(n) problem so expanding blocksize limit does not hurt clients at any appreciable rate.

Mauldin probably also cannot envision an economic system that is not based on debt.  The biggest problem with deflation is that debt can get scary really fast as what you have to pay back becomes harder to attain.
I would be one of those people that would argue that debt economy is very destructive (perpetually fund wars you don't have to pay for) but I can't argue against the idea that it is a powerful tool that will be used so it has been used to its very limits.
I think Mauldin understands our current economy and the subtler ramifications of policy really well because he has been steeped in it for so long.  And his job is to continue to understand the subtle changes of the larger economy so most of his attention will still be devoted there.  I give him kudos for taking Bitcoin seriously at all but, like all of us when we were first learning, he will first attempt to fit Bitcoin into his established world view.

I think statistical modeling would show that a system sufficiently complex with so many contributors starts to behave in ways similar to individuals who, in turn, are really just complex systems responding to contributing inputs.  For all intents and purposes Bitcoin does behave on its own because it is probable that no single outside influence can direct it or predict it with certainty.
Just broaden the definition.  We, society, markets, in regards to the experiment called Bitcoin are still very immature when we are often mistaken for being mature because of the size and attention we received.
You can also say Bitcoin is an individual living in a small society call cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is the most robust and most likely to survive and the society is even more likely to survive.
"There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin" does not mean the price will go back up.  Systems can and do die no matter how promising.  I just think it is good to step back and take things in perspective.  My opinion is that crypto has a long future and nothing in that space looks more compelling to me than Bitcoin.  But the space is not mature enough to meet the demands we seem to want to force on it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:07:41
Yeah, unless you can move bitcoin to any address you choose you don't have bitcoin.  Maybe I am missing a nuance, but Circle can operate as a fractional reserve artificially inflating the supply of bitcoin.  If bitcoin were transferable out of the account as bitcoin this would be a Ponzi, but since  they completely control the "bitcoin" it will be a fractional reserve.
Again, I am just assuming they will operate as a fractional reserve, because you don't make real money unless you are risking your customer's funds.

Alex Daley keeps almost making good points and then falls back to fundamental misunderstandings of how and why things actually happen.  George Gilder refuses to make points and just trumpets Bitcoin.  Mauldin falls back to the safe position of "it's all about 2.0 and 3.0".  Everyone else is great.
Overall one of the best docs made by old money I have seen.  Some hand waving but does not get too much wrong.  Mauldin writes one of my favorite newsletters but the general theme of them is "everything is fundamentally much worse than it appears."  So definitely go into it knowing that.

Right now I think price falling is causing price to fall.  People who have been holding a large amounts of bitcoin they picked up for almost nothing are watching their value deplete.  I think they are hedging and still taking a huge gain.
I think a big part of this is the people who were mining when they were getting 50 coins a block and not having to sell a large part of their stock to keep operating.  I would agree that mining isn't everything but I think it is an effect magnifier.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:28:18
I think I was ambiguous and misunderstood so let me try to clarify.  In our economy the CREATION of money is based on debt.  More debt = larger money supply.
While I think you are correct I don't believe many people operate with your classical view of debt because debt is currently so intertwined and associated with money creation (and subsequent destruction).  It is just a different metaphor, but I look at money like potential energy.  It can be converted into kinetic energy (getting someone else to do something) with a transaction but is always stored again as potential energy.

Well, this is very encouraging and thank you for that.  Just wanted to follow up on a couple of your points.
I made this instruction page just for the bithack competition.  I was expecting the reader to be technical.  I have not sent this to any customers as part of a pitch.  I do understand that one of my big weaknesses is that I can't shut up and I have a hard time deciding what is important and what can be learned later.
The interface for the end user is better and was done by a UI guy.  The setup pages are very raw but unfortunately that is the first thing most people will see???  Anyway, they could definitely be better.
My first idea for this was that a gov or FSA would be the signatuer of last resort but some people I talked to said I should probably be ready and willing to be that service myself.  I am very pragmatic and would certainly be willing to license the software as source or run it myself, whatever my customer actually wants.
Getting in the front door to even do a pitch has been insanely hard for me.  To date I have done 2 to potential customers and both meetings were facilitated by friends.  Cold calling has gotten me nowhere.  People just freeze me out at the word bitcoin.  In a new strategy I have tried to volunteer as a speaker for local financial conferences thinking the first step getting my customers comfortable with me is education but no one has taken me up on it.
So if there was something you could do to help, it would be to give me a new angle of attack.

I have been working on something for a while when I get time.  It is pretty much fully operational but I can't seem to get customer interest.  I would love feedback.
The premise is that I want to give banks a widget that will allow their customers to be their regular not secure selves and still hold bitcoin securely.  Multi-sig, HD, yada yada.
I want to work with banks so that they can move into bitcoin and still be banks by offering security and ease of use in exchange for fees.  So far no one seems to care, least of all the bitcoin community where it seems that you are supposed to hate banks and try to kill them at all times.

My favorite thing is that you can vote with money.  I have a longstanding theory of the right vs. the righteous and how the right is only measured by money that is made.  It is great when the two coincide but I have seen where that has not happened esp in crypto.  Eth classic was righteous but it paid more to be right.
The BCH fork was the best thing to happen to bitcoin as a whole relieving so much of the internal political pressure and allowing bitcoin to grow.  Now Core totally screwed the pooch and reneged on 2x and allowed BCH to become a monster who may end BTC.  Chasing the righteous over the right.  Hope BTC can recover from that.

That was a ton of hind sight interpretation of motivation in that video in order to label something a scam.  Claiming to know someone's intent for a detail in a complicated system when their stated intent makes sense is a pretty good indicator that you are wrong.  Unintended consequences != scam.  Side effects != scam.  And if you are just basing it off the immutability issue with the classic fork, the fork allows the market to decide.  Each dev makes their choice and that may not seem fair to have a small group have an overweight position, but markets aren't fair.  That is still not a scam.
All these things and I still don't see where anything was a scam.  When do the creators of ethereum pull the rug out from all the users and exploit the malicious things they purposefully put in the protocol?

There are 2 scammy parts of the evidence you laid out.
1) Lying about premine totals.
2) Inflation distribution not being set.
The rest is just "stuff you don't like" like pivoting and forking and previous bad dealings and may be valid warning flags to you as you make an informed decision about where you want your money.  But even bitcoin at 21M is not set in stone.  Though admittedly ETH is more risky on that end, there is no solid future proofing of total supply and consensus by votes or force can change it.
If I don't agree with the video then I did not watch it fairly?  I watched two guys reluctantly agree with each other about so many claims.  They have their reasons to not like it, but I still reserve the term scam for purposeful deception like lying about premine totals.

How do you police the ranks of a decentralized ecosystem?  Censorship?  I support the idea of a big block project as well and honestly if I am considered a part of the BCH community I don't really pay attention to the marketing of BTC or BCH.  I fully know the difference between the two.  The rest is just two sides saying what they firmly believe.  I don't think either side is lying or scamming but again, I don't pay all that much attention past the technicals.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:14:42
Ah yes, your worst objection.  Censorship risk in running "turing complete" code.  I just look at that argument as a strawman.  Why is that considered the point of Ethereum by you?  For many people, the point of Ethereum is the efficiency of a discoverable marketplace that can keep counterparties honest and transparent with each other.  I have heard arguments of "well why do you need a blockchain?"  In many cases you don't, but that does not preclude you from using one.  Having the blockchain introduces the other added efficiency of automated settlement across parties that don't agree on currency by forcing the agreement.  Linking turing complete code with censorship resistant money is the point.  You can't pull out half of that statement and attack it as if it stood on its own.  I do think that many of these things have not been fully realized but the potential is still there.  Maybe Ethereum isn't the best way to do it, but again failing at being the best in the world is not a scam.
And your argument that your node sets the 21M supply in stone.  That is all well and good until the miners don't agree.  Then your node isn't on the biggest POW chain and all your node supports is a very attackable altcoin.  Same argument used against BCH.

Here is the way to think about it.  A bitcoin is not a thing.  You don't send bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a unit of measurement.  On the Bitcoin network you send a transaction and that transaction is measured in units of bitcoin.  Just like your finger's length can be 0.04432 meters depending on how accurate you want to get you can send 0.04432 bitcoin if you are interested in sending $10.23792 with that level of accuracy.  When a miner gets his/her reward of 25BTC for finding a block what they are actually getting is a spendable transaction measured at 25BTC that originates in the block they just mined.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:58:47
I am bringing this up because I want to know the correct answer.  I thought that the client would not have a 10 minute window to try to double spend the transactions.  When the transaction was broadcast it would be propagated along nodes until it reached the payee who would verify that it came in.  To dupe the payee the payor would have to broadcast the double spend to a different node and count on the transaction he wanted getting to the payee because nodes will reject and not propagate transactions that they view as being double spends.  Then it is a matter of the miners accepting the transaction that did not go the payee.  So in essence if someone is trying to double spend dupe you, they are VERY sophisticated and needing to wait for even 1 confirmation is typically not necessary for smaller transactions.
World wide transaction propagation typically happens in seconds (I believe) not minutes so that does not give the attacker much time to try to dupe the payee.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:24:05
I love the idea on the surface, my biggest holdup and the reason I have not done any work on this idea myself (working on my own project currently) is that merchants typically know nothing about hosting web services.  Most of them would not even be able to get a computer set up and connected to the internet on their own.
As a point of sale service you really need to be able to hand them hardware.  Setting up a raspberry pi with a cheap simple display is easy enough to do, but then you have to integrate with their current POS system or they don't want it.  They don't want 2 sets of books and they don't want 2 places where they might have to ring you up.
Can you explain the use case of your project?  Who would set up and run your service?

Yes, I can't remember how much of this is in the video.  But the numbers work out like this (roughly meaning within 1 or 2 orders of magnitude).  The number of public keys that could be generated if all computing power on earth were dedicated to producing public keys for 100 years is the roughly the same number as grains of sand on the earth.  All the vast deserts and beaches and the stuff underground as well.  This is a really big number because computers are fast and we have a lot of them.  And now we need to think of this number in terms of water.  It is also roughly equivalent to the number of molecules in a cup of water.
The number of available public keys is roughly equivalent to the number of water molecules on earth.  So if you were grand hegemon of earth and decided to mandate all computing power were used to generate public keys to find bitcoin and you ran this program for 100 years it would be roughly equivalent to taking a cup, filling it with water from somewhere, and hoping you got the right water molecule.
Even if you use the birthday problem formula and assume every human stored bitcoin in 100 different addresses so you have 700 billion active public keys the chances of a single duplicate are still insanely small.  I don't know the exact calc for this so someone might be able to help me out but it should be far less than 1 / 2^40 which is pretty impossible by itself.

I like this idea better for one reason.  Bitcoin miners generate a lot of heat and do not function when they get too hot.  While remote location solar gets you the power you need, a functioning miner still needs air conditioning typically.  With a mountain stream you could build a flowing water channel to efficiently dissipate heat from your machines.

@_date: 2015-10-20 16:05:56
If you are thinking that people somehow reserve bitcoin addresses that is incorrect.  Secret keys are an integer in real space between two numbers.  Being in real space means they exist without being dependent on hardware.  The number 27 is the same everywhere.  The number 27 is also a secret key that translates to a public address.  That same public address for the private key 27 will be create no matter where or when or by whom it is created.
In a way we already have all the private keys everywhere already because we know the range they exist in.  The exercise is to check them all which is impossible in any reasonable time frame.
Now technically you are trying to find the range of public addresses which is smaller than the range of private keys but you do this by trying private keys and your time frame does not become anywhere close to manageable for an entire civilization working in unison.

James, that is a big can of worms so we will probably have to talk.  I can definitely help you out placing caches in the database (because I know him personally everyone) based on unique qr codes you are printing out.  Also, in a future iteration I am going to have the concept of a cache paying out multiple incremental amounts so it can be used for multiple claims.  It will have checks to make sure the same person is not claiming the same code multiple times but that way you won't have to monitor and recharge the code (which you can do from the website btw).

If you are not doing it automated then don't do it.  I had a passive scheme running at one time.  It checked prices and also checked my current holdings in each currency.  It checked for opportunities by percentage and would only execute if the opportunity was above a certain percentage and I had funds in the correct currency to execute.  It would only work in more volatile times when one exchange would be higher and then the other exchange would be higher.  I would store the gains in bitcoin.  This was excellent because you never have to move funds from one exchange to another.  You just have to not care which exchange happens to be holding USD or BTC at any given time.
This eventually failed when I happened to peg the bottom of a trend and my order did not get in on time.  Then the price bounced and I did not cover my other trade and lost a bunch of money.  After that, the API started failing to put in trades at all for some reason.  Then all the exchanges started experiencing trade lag and I just stopped the arbitrage all together.

I was in the same boat.  What really bothered me about it was the phrase "it would have ABSOLUTELY no value except that people believe in it and accept it as payment".  Which is actually false because it can always be used as a means of publicly accessible and cryptographically secured contracts.  They are more accurate than most I will grant but the wording was definitely meant to draw attention.

There was a rather effective gold confiscation program in the United States in the 30's.  Before that the price of gold was pegged to the dollar.  I would think those types of things make it look like gold at least was fairly well controlled.

Just to provide additional information.  My friend is selling Printed Circuit Board ornaments (most of them with touch activated LED display).  For those that like to search history, yes this is the same friend that recently started selling solar panels for bitcoin [FlexSolarCells.com](  He found that to be worth while so he told me he was going to switch this one to bitcoin as well.

I can't put any in Australia.  The cheat defeating mechanism is that it couples lat/long with the contents of the QR code.  I could put a cache down in Australia at a correct lat/long but I have no idea the content of any QR codes in that area.  On the other hand, you are more than welcome to put one in Australia (or several :))

While electricity is a small fraction of the total cost when considering hardware right now, things level off when the cost of operation levels with the expected output because of increased global hash rate.  If I have to spend $3/day in the Netherlands for a machine that produces $2/day it does not matter how much the machine cost, it is a pretty bad deal.  I think we are going to reach the point where the global hashing power will push expected output down to the point where the only thing that matters is your local cost of electricity before 2014 is out.
This does not happen when technology is on a rampage lowering $/Gh as fast as it has been but I don't think we are going to see many tech gains once the Dec/Jan 28nm flood happens.  The last phase for $/Gh reduction is commoditization but by that point the expected output should near energy prices.  I don't expect the KNCMiner will be obsolete in a year but it won't be worth buying at the same price.
I am guessing the biggest discrepancy in our arguments is that I consider a year down the road to not really be all that much time.  I think that the current rate of ASIC production, electricity will be a very large factor within a year.

1) I did not know that before this comment so thanks for letting us all know.
2) That's awesome!  I think everyone should accept bitcoin.  The more the merrier!  It looks like the product lines might be catering to different needs so the more people that accept bitcoin the more that bitcoin can fulfill your purchasing needs.

I think we are going to be surprised at the number of places and ways to use it in three years.  More to the point is that I don't see anyone who thinks it is going nowhere who does not also demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of it.

Yes, the context of this is to be very noob-friendly.  People should not have to know anything about bitcoin to do this, but if they want to utilize their new found riches outside the game they are going to have to learn.

Interesting.  I knew that fracking pulled the whole lot up pretty fast but I thought all of that was accounted for when they were capitalizing the drilling expenses.

I also just got my refund through Paypal using this.  I spent 2 weeks with Paypal using their dispute system and that did not work.  My order was marked as refunded in BFL's system but they were not returning the money.  Glad this worked because it probably saved me a bunch of time I would have spent doing the same thing with my credit card.

Not sure I understand your question.  I believe he ships internationally.  I do see that if I change the site to French that the Bitpay link is gone.  Possibly an oversite.  Bitcoin is like love.  It is a universal payment system.  I will bring that to his attention.

Hurray willful internet misinterpretation!  Isn't there a bitcoin article you need to write?
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:57:23
Ah, in that case I do know something about bitpay.  I have never used them but I have sat through plenty of presentations.  They certainly claim that USD is not the only currency they use.  This is speaking from the top of my head but I believe they will pay in ~40 different fiat currencies as long as your bank account accepts them and I am pretty certain you do not have to be doing business in the US.  Also, they will pay percentages in fiat and bitcoin in what ever arbitrary way you would like.
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:02:08
Yeah, I would love for other people to set up caches.  It only works with my app and the app is only on Android, but you can make any QR code a cache and leave any arbitrarily small amount of bitcoin at a cache.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:40:28
I would say yes, but then I can't actually name another third party solution.  They definitely have their shit together and provide a smooth user experience.  I have paid for things with bitpay before.  I don't have first hand experience as a merchant but they claim they deliver funds next day, every day.  That sounds pretty good.  Also, the fee they charge is tiny compared with other third party non-bitcoin solutions.

I was hoping for a reply like this.  I definitely wanted a good list of places to post his business.  Thanks!

I am really starting to hate the fact that everyone says you store your bitcoin in a digital wallet.  I realize this may be needed for the non-initiated to understand the concept of the components but it is wrong and for security purposes it is a dangerous concept.  Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain.  If people believe the coin exists in their wallet then it is hard for them to understand how easy brainwallets are to attack.

If liking an overpriced device whose sole purpose is to accomplish a consumerist non-productive task a little better than other devices on the market is what qualifies me to make a statement about alternative currencies then I guess I am screwed.
Also, I did not say he should listen to me that bitcoin is the future.  I said he should do what he understands and believes, just not to tell people they are wrong because he doesn't get it the way someone else does.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:32:00
What I don't understand is how can anyone be taken seriously when they can't get their logic straight:
Brad DeLong - "Placing a ceiling on the value of bitcoins is computer technology and the form of the hash function… until the limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached. Placing a floor on the value of bitcoins is… what, exactly?"
How does limiting supply put a ceiling on value exactly?  You get the statement right with gold but can't muster the smarts to logic out this simple statement.  Unfortunately, when it comes to exacting flows of logic, if you aren't completely right then your answer is completely wrong.

As a comedian I am more offended that he doesn't know what a joke is or how to tell one than I am about his views on Bitcoin.  At least Bitcoin hasn't been around for thousands of years.

tl;dr: 1) Saving for retirement in an inflationary ecosystem means you have to save more and spend less now.
2) Deflation makes you feel richer.  People spend when they feel rich.
3) The real problem is that people will not want to invest deflationary currency because holding is already a low risk investment.

You do not see any value in bitcoin.  Hundreds of thousands to millions of people do see that is has value.  Neither party is wrong.  I don't see any value in iPods.  I never have.  I never understood why so many people bought iPods.  People buying iPods were not wrong just because I did not find value in that product.
I will NOT say that you not understanding or believing in bitcoin makes you a lesser person.  If you don't understand or believe in bitcoin then I urge you not to purchase any.  Don't be a non-understanding speculator.
I will say that for myself I do not hold bitcoin as a speculation.  When I first bought my line of thought was "I get it, this is a great idea, I am willing to lose $X to show my support and be a part of this."  At this time I have not lost my money and after actually using bitcoin I have empirical first hand evidence that my initial impression on how resourceful bitcoin is was absolutely correct.

It depends on how you look at it but I think for the question you really want answered then the answer is no.  Colored coins are a way to interpret the existing blockchain and therefore there is no central clearinghouse but confirmations are distributed.  This project is about providing a tool to rapidly deploy a crypto audit system for internal and external use but relies on a more centralized clearinghouse with the expectation that the people running the servers have the most vested interest in everything be right and accurate.

After watching butterfly labs I know the correct answer is that I have no idea.  I just got the design and communication document to my friend.  He is a very good developer but this is not his only side project.  I will also say there is a chance it will never get released because of Apple.  Bitcoin apps historically have trouble getting released.  On top of that it will be a free app where monetization is kept completely away from Apple which they have also shown they don't like.

While I think most people would cave under the pressure of a gun to their head there are two safeguards from confiscation.  Encrypted wallets and offsite backup (yes they have my wallet but that does not mean they have my bitcoin).  Brainwallet (I don't have bitcoin.  Then where is it?  Take any bitcoin you find around here).  Gold isn't as protected from physical confiscation.  Also, trading gold can be a bit conspicuous.  You can hold your gold but if you try to trade it there is a lot of risk getting caught.  With bitcoin I can sit in my room and effectively move control of the value to Spain without anyone able to stop the transaction.

I saw Chris Odom give a talk about [Monetas]( and that project is this idea already done and done really well.  Seriously, before the talk I was thinking how his project was unnecessary since we have Bitcoin but after his presentation I was thinking how incredible his tool was.  It is like setting up your own accounting system that spans as far as you want it and it is able to trade in any currency including on the fly made up currencies that you want to generate for a specific use case.  It is a central clearing house because it is not trying to compete with Bitcoin, it is trying to scratch a different itch.  Seriously, it takes a bit of digging into to appreciate and the findable info isn't super helpful.  Can someone reply with a link that better describes the backend software?
