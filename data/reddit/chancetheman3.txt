Can you imagine being asked when a vital project core to a businesses future is going to be ready and you say to your boss, "when its ready"
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:12:55
whats fucking ridiculous about this post is satoshi didnt want high fees or long transaction times as the 3 tx/s limit was intended to be temporary 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:53:29
Where's the proof that roger ver is spamming the network buddy we're all trying to figure this situation out
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:08
yeah because I dont like the high transaction fees and clogged ass mempool im a shill? fuck off man
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:17
See you when that shit collapses because the blockchain is a complete failure and only works for the rich right now
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:23:10
I wonder if they'll require you pay a $15 fee or let you do a $1 fee and wait 2 weeks for the money
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:34:48
I don't care if it's completely unusable I have 3 bitcoin so the fees are nothing to a top 1% like me!
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:23:33
How is it her fault that other puppies don’t have a home? Maybe start shaming people that let their dogs breed instead of the customer 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:36:07
What the hell are you saying "that means what". Thats a huge deal and youre trying to downplay it. You can actually use BCH as a currency right now. You can actually get your transactions processed within hours on BCH. From a technical standpoint that means 100% more user satisfaction and faster processing. From a technical standpoint that means everything. 
I don't give a fuck about the open source if its straight broken and unusable. There are no solutions. No one has any solutions for bitcoin. The top comment is always "LN IS ON THE WAY". No its not, its not even finished or usable. There is absolutely no scaling and no one is in charge to fix it. Only the richest of the rich can get transactions done in a reasonable time on bitcoin for the past month. 
Shit is fucked, why are you being ignorant
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:07:49
How can you do homework on answers that dont exist. There are no answers there is no release date or allocated time frame. Idiot. Keep up with the propoganda. Toxic ass community
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:03
I mean I just don't get why its demonized, i listened to that roger ver guy and while he is a little crazy they are right in that they are in satoshi's vision of bitcoin as a currency, and right now it functions as a currency better than bitcoin. srry to go against the grain. satoshi also put the 3 tx/s block size limit temporarily and now its still being kept on and pumping high fees
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:32
your employer is going to pay you in bitcoin? is that what you're saying? because the government wont ever let that happen. this "revolution" is never going to take down the banking system. Let's be fucking real here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:20
right looks like you have the agenda here not me
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:50:09
Listen I dont even own any bcash but at least they don't have to pay $28 to send anything
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:44
You may have not noticed, but the price is tanking and upsetting a lot of people because you have to pay $50 per transaction. The only reason the coin has surged in price is the common investor, should show some respect and appreciation for that and at the very least facilitate a community of open discussion rather than insults
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:53:36
Just as I thought, no one can answer these basic ass questions that anyone would ask in corporate upper management. Three simple questions can't be fully answered here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:43
friendly people around here
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:57:26
Do you always tell investors to "go do your own damn research"? This subreddit must be full of kids or clowns, not sure which
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:12:40
as of right now the poor cannot use bitcoin so yeah id say when only the rich can use it efficiently its broken
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:36
its not even done and every 6 months it is "on the way!"
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:01:31
Learn to not be rude when answering questions buddy
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:30
Keep up the propoganda circle jerk then. There are real issues and real investors at stake
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:18:17
there is no guide or instruction for the average person to adopt segwit and even then the fees are only reduced 30% of an already high ass number
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:38:41
This guy is a straight liar and I don’t know if it’s propaganda or what
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:13
have you considered the fact that it costs like $1 to send Bitcoin cash and it costs $40+ and rising to send any bitcoin ? or we just going to blatantly ignore that
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:19
in the short period of a single month the fees shot up to $50 and the mempool reached record cloggin highs
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:43:52
you have any proof hes "paying people to spam network"? Seriously we all deserve some proof so we can expose him. Waiting on it
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:51:07
keep acting like common people don't make mistakes sending coins to wrong addresses and setting too high/low fees. blatantly ignorant
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:22:17
Where the hell can you adopt that breed. Any pure bred like that is rarely adoptable. She wanted that dog don’t shame people because they paid for what they wnated
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:00
man you're a real propoganda piece of shit. tell your boss or your wife that your bitcoins are in danger from being a failing network
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:34
yeah its totally not because the general public got into bitcoin and the network can't handle it. Totally under attack! the fuck wrong with you
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:28
havent ever posted there... keep fucking up real discussion
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:16
because its a cartel and the profits are the only motive
