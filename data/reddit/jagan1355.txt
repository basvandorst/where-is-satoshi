So a “blog” article is your source of information? Or you are the guy writing this blog ? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:38:42
Why post a fake article without any source ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:21:34
Wait, what ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:25:47
Do they also stop shopping or transacting online ? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:15:44
Why would it need to be exactly 10btc for a statistic test? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:06:13
This doesn’t make any sense. Of course you can transfer btc from any exchange in India to hardware/software wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:27:11
If you really got in at 800$, why didn’t you get out at say 10k$ ? 15k$ ? You want us to believe that you sold at exactly the ATH so far ? 
You seem to treat bitcoin as a get rich scheme which I feel is a 2nd half of 2017 syndrome. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:23:13
The site sucks at so many levels. Why are the FAQs not in English and some Latin language?  Register does not work, the OTP is sent to a random mobile number ? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:13:23
I’m not really sure about the 1 year part. There will be too many active cold storage wallets in that category. The overall idea looks fun though :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:11
This was not necessary

Bitcoin is designed to be inflationary in the short term(with mining rewards every block) and deflationary in the long term.

You could also refer them to watch his YouTube channel. I never thought time on YouTube could be so productive :) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:04:13
Almost felt like the first time DT made some sense :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:21:57
It is way easier and safer for you to learn the experience of moving btc to cold storage when the amount is minimal, although the fee could be bit of a problem. Transferring huge amounts for the first time could be intense :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:18:07
This is anything but “random”.

Couple of years ? Not checking prices for a couple of minutes feels like eternity to some people. That is what is called addiction :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:29:34
Next few hours ? Both up and down, If you treat bitcoin as a “get rich quick” scheme then you are missing the whole point. Invest only if you believe in the technology, else don’t. There are thousands of other alt coins for speculators and day traders. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:45
These posts again ? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:24:40
Because after 6 confirmations, there is practically no way that the transaction can be reversed. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:11:58
So your 2020 vision just got updated to a 2 day panic action from a 2k dip in price ?

You need to be careful though, that you don’t forget to eat/sleep once you start watching aantonop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:51:15
People just register a domain, post random shit about bitcoin and share the “news” here. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:00:07
And .. if you keep someone in charge of your money, eventually they will try to steal it :)

Every time the btc difficulty increases, r/btc is flooded with posts about the “flippening” :) 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:46:19
Unfortunately the exchanges in India don’t let you choose custom fee when transferring btc. First the premium to buy and then too high fee to transfer, they suck at all levels :) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:55:09
I would say spread the 500€ across 2 or 3 buys, but hey it’s just my opinion. Welcome on board :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:50:53
How long ago did we celebrate the 10k ATH ? It is more than 13k now and there is panic to sell ? Wow. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:01
Please search for and read the bitcoin white paper.

Mining is essentially securing the network, the block reward is the incentive to do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:21:23
I understood your point mate. Tell me what will stop you from doing the exact same thing “rinse and repeat” over and over again ? At this point, you are just day trading rather than hodling :). Good luck to you anyway and welcome to the future.

This sub has like 5.7 million subscribers and almost 20k people online at any point in time. Of course most of the threads are about price and newbies asking for advice. Maybe only follow the top posts so that you can filter out the mostly similar price prediction posts ?

Once you understand how the banking system works, it is so easy to see bitcoin as a ray of hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:33:37
Probably it has to do something with the exponential growth and price increase. Most people think in terms of Fiat currency and are tempted (not entirely their fault) to cash out. If only bitcoin price grew at a lesser and steadier rate, majority of people would see it more as a MOE rather than a speculative store of value. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:10:13
Is there even one news article in mainstream media that talks remotely positive things about bitcoin? Don’t think so. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:00:17
Yes both.

Wow you sound like you just saw a hypernova explode. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:08:20
Most important thing of bitcoin is to control your keys and not leave btc on an exchange. Coinbase have not yet given bch which forked in August, it is not certain that they provide any support for future forks.
If you control your keys and want to redeem forked coins, you can do that using a compatible wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:55:09
Such a poorly written article :( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:03
Would be a great pleasure to meet Andreas in person. He is a true genius. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:01
What is faster ? Speed of light or volatility of bitcoin? This variance in price change is practically impossible to tack.

Before learning about bitcoin, I recommend you to spend just one day browsing about these topics 
1) how federal reserve bank works
2) fractional reserve lending 
3) how investment banks caused the financial crisis
Once you understand these, it is very easy to see the power of programmable money i.e. bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:52:32
You still have your whole bitcoin with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:09:05
You bought at 17k ? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:36:08
It is technically complex, I’ll try to explain 
Miners find blocks nearly every 10mins and put selected transactions from the mempool into the block. 
There could be a case where more than one miner find a block almost simultaneously. let’s say we have 2 miners finding 2 blocks at the same time and there is a temporary chain split(fork). 
After the next block is found, this split is resolved and there is one clear winner block. 
After only 1 confirmation, it means that your transaction is in that block but there is no 100% chance it will still be in the next block. So you need to wait until a few more blocks are mined and you get more confirmations. After 6 confirmations, you are pretty sure that your transaction is permanent.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:02:11
Put most of your btc in cold storage if not already done. Helps you keep your panic levels in check. Works for me at least:) 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:42:43
You wouldn’t mind sending someone money without knowing the other person sends you the btc?

I suggest you watch a video of Andreas antonopoulos where he explains exactly why a 51% attack is not practical. It is in one of his QandA playlist. YouTube channel - aantonop

The technology is much more attractive than the price, watch aantonop and you will start seeing a whole new world about to become a reality in our generation.

Hold the original investment and put in a few more bucks now to cost average. That way you will make better returns. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:03:56
I will panic buy 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:14:08
Next week if the price goes to 20k, you will ask the question “bitcoin is so expensive right now, can I still make profit?” 
It is entirely up to you to convince yourself where to put your money and take the consequences of your decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:05:25
And if you do bring up the topic, talk more about the technology part rather than the price and profits.

In my opinion, all the current prices are inflated because of the never ending printing of fiat money. I don’t think you can directly correlate current dollar prices to prices if/when our society lives on hard money (btc/gold). 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:14:46

There is an update from zebpay exchange that they might be forced to stop fiat withdrawal due to the RBI order. This caused panic and the price drop. Usually Indian markets are at a premium compared to the global market. Today is our day to collect some cheap btc :)

Forget different currencies, the price will not be exactly the same on any 2 exchanges in the same country. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:10:58
There are several exchanges still that operate normally. The exchanges just had to change their banks, as big banks closed their accounts. Instant deposits using things like phonepay are working perfectly fine.

At least 90% of the alts will crash and burn. There are way too many false promises.

Predicting the price by timing the market is practically impossible. Humans are usually driven by greed and panic. When the price raises, we get greedy and buy .. when the price drops, we panic sell.  So it happens that we buy high and sell low. DCA is the best approach and it minimises risk.

It is a bad idea to leave btc on exchanges anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:06:41
For me, the cancellation of segwit2x itself is a really good news :) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:30:34
Why did you come down from predicting 10k$ to 7k$ in like 30 min btw ? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:38:27
Got any newer article rather than from 2 months ? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:48:37
Aantonop the main man. Just sucks you in with his intellect :) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:23:58
The thing is .. not too long ago, the same price was an ATH and everyone was celebrating :) 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:11:51
Thanks ! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:21
The posts other day about the flippening were fun though. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:40:00
Are you a girl ? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:57:47
Your keys your bitcoin. Not your keys not your bitcoin. Do not leave btc on any exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:48:33
But you know it is Bitcoin, not bitcoins right ? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:06:01
Why does someone post this “news” every 20 mins ?! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:14:45
I like this comment. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:55:59
This is pure BS. Also, they have withdrawal fee based on the amount of btc you transfer which doesn’t make sense. Transfer fee should be based on the transaction size. I don’t think they are technically capable enough to implement it. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:10:44
The minimum fee is 0.0005 btc. How small transactions are we talking about ? And why should people transacting in high amounts pay more fee ? It is not a feature of bitcoin. Btc doesn’t care if you transfer 1 rupee or 100 crore. Fee should only depend on the transaction size and not the amount transferred. 
Please don’t try to back these stupid centralised exchanges that suck huge amounts of fee.

Hey Lauda 
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:37:56
This about the author. Apparently, one year in crypto space makes you an expert :)
“Michael is currently in his 3rd year studying finance at Florida State University. He has been following the cryptocurrency community closely for the past year. He started becoming interested in crypto after investing in Bitcoin with friends and family before venturing out into the altcoin market.”
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:03:20
That aantonop DP though :) 
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:20:58
I really thought you were a bot typing “bullish” :) 
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:40:08
Lol lauda 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:54:44
Aantonop 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:58:34
I think he is referring to the PNB scandal.
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:49:14
Can someone translate this to English ?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:45:26
Oh man that is about equity market and not crypto/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:52:46
I am optimistic that you are the same person as the lauda :) 
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:26:35
Neeraj, don’t leave any btc on exchanges like Unocoin, zebpay etc. please use at least a software wallet. You can pm me and I will help you if required. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:23:59
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:46:24
Wow.. they are such a scam .. their website says something and their GitHub says something else .. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:48:17
I think all cloud mining sites are ponzi schemes. There is no mining happening, they only pay existing customers with money from new customers. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:47:27
Seriously though, media should understand the difference between “not legal” and “illegal”. So much FUD. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:19:14
Most probably not but if you control your private keys (on paper wallet for eg.) you have coins on both the chains. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:23:06
First add a fraction of btc to your existing amount of btc. Then transfer the whole btc to another wallet for wich you hold your keys. 
Eg: If I have say 1btc and I added 0.001btc, now I have 1.001 btc and 1 btg. Now if I transfer the 1.001 btc, the transaction cannot be replayed because I don’t own 1.001 in btg. Hope this is clear. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:26:13
The article is from January. Why are you spreading nonsense ? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:02:52
Just make a paper wallet, transfer the bitcoin and store the paper in a safe place. Don’t leave any bitcoin on Zebpay. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 02:41:56
If there is any price that Bitcoin cannot literally “trade” at, it is 0 dollars. Go find out why. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:55:19
Thanks for the heads up, I’ll get my Fiat ready. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:25:39
Can you point me to a link where it says replay protection is not implemented yet ? I read on their website that it will be implemented. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:12:16
Proof that it was sent from official account ? Of course you don’t have it. He could be a liar and scammer but what you are doing is cheap. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:45:28
Do not leave any money on any exchange. For small amounts of btc, paper wallet is the best, free and secure. Read this and you will have all the required info: [paper wallet info]( 
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:39:14
There are still some exchanges that are operating normally. bitbns is one that I use. Koinex loop lets you do a peer to peer buy/sell which is cool. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:17:03
It is already working. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:32:15
Of course not. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:13:07
DCA will get you better entry positions, it also saves you from FOMO like now. Look into buying smaller amounts and you will be golden :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:09:10
There is an excellent video from Andreas antonopoulos regarding blockchain and how it is “incorrectly” promoted as THE technology behind bitcoin. You may want to watch it my friend. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:18:56
Start by reading and understanding the technology first. Look at YouTube videos from Andreas antonopoulos. I say tech first currency next. Good luck:) 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:32:01
When is the iOS version coming ?

A Satoshi today is a Satoshi tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:44:39
Why don’t you go back to your r/nofap ? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:01:59
If you are new to bitcoin, I suggest reading about the technology first. It is awesome! 
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:33:12
The only unit of Bitcoin is Satoshi. So, essentially you are buying multiples of Satoshi rather than fraction of Bitcoin. Hope it makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:44:44
Thanks for the post, you have my downvote. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:13:30
 is the best place to start. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:31:45
You are in the Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:51:14
If you have to choose only one, would you go to the future or past ? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:00:03
Exactly .. the funny thing is .. bitcoin was always at a premium in India. With the recent RBI FUD, I could finally grab some very cheap btc. I’m not selling a bit for shit. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:28:54
Where did you buy ?
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:27:55
Not healthy .. Just configure alerts .. then you know when the price is range bound. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:48:59
FUD and BS. This “news” is almost a month old. All exchanges updated their banks, price already back up to global levels. Also, there is a case in Delhi court against RBI. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:21:44
Serious traders wont even have time to read these articles, would they ? :) .. anyway, I just had to vent because the number of these price prediction/analysis posts are way too high. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:50:33
Why is Rupee in here ? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:13:22
You bot bro?
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:04:43
The “No” in Fiat fraud should be “of course”. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:08:25
Why limit ourselves to cars ?

@_date: 2018-04-21 06:41:41
You posting this on other subs makes me believe you are playing a double troll role. No one falls for this school boy stuff. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:47:50
Personally, I stopped thinking in terms of fiat value for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:38:36
Incorrect title.

Prove it and I’ll give you that, 10$ worth of Bitcoin.

You need to read/checkout “the creature from Jekyll island” by G. Edward griffin. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:37:51
I see you participate only in the daily discussion threads... interesting :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:50:27
Stop with your FUD. All major exchanges are running as usual, they updated their bank accounts. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:07:04
Who told you the exchanges “will” shutdown in 3 months lol ? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:12:45
Struggles above 9k? OK. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:05:28
“To ensure our customers security” lol 
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:07:59
276 days ago you posted you had a outrageous business idea. How did that go ? 
@_date: 2018-04-30 10:23:33
What’s up with the dated, irrelevant and totally shitty FUD article posts guys .. most of the new posts are crap from some days. Can we ban these bots/shills ?
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:55:56
I really hope you are trolling :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:29:27
You just posted another article “Above $8k” and now this “Above $7k” ? Are you a bot or retarded ? Or both ? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:54:06
Don’t ever use that site.

@_date: 2018-04-07 10:28:45
Pls don’t talk shit that you are not aware of. Both your buy/sell prices are absolutely incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 10:37:08
What ?
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:10:45
What is the point of producing these articles ? 1k up and bulls are back, 1k down and bear market is still here ? Who even clicks on such articles !?
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:15:21
Bro, what is the language in which the article is written ? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:59:52
No it doesn’t. If you visit a stocks sub for example, I’m sure no one mentions Bitcoin. It doesn’t mean that Bitcoin doesn’t exist. That’s how communities work in general. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:48:23
Yes but we are now at 7k and not 10k, right ?
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:10:50
Dips bellow $400 ? What does that mean ? English fail, math fail lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:36:07
Get someone to proof read your articles, may be? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:12:05
Wow you shitpost and still have such good karma ? :)
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:26:44
Can we ban this user ? Continuous Intentional FUD posts of dated articles!! 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:33:30
I remember watching Andreas’s “currency wars and bitcoin neutrality” in which he talks about this. Awesome talk from him as always. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:28:27
Definitely either a bot or a karma whore account. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:16:14
Again ? What 400$ ? I alone invested a lot more than 400$. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:02:38

What does the title even mean? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:30:59
But you request for donations already without even forming a team ? With just a random website ? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:15:21
Granted permission by who ? I don’t see any details on the website. It honestly looks like a scam. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:57:17
Alright, I will closely monitor the site for updates and if it is genuine, I will be more than glad to contribute my 2 sats. Thanks!
