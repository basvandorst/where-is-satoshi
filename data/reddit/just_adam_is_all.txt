I put in a deposit with gdax last week, as I've been doing lately,  and it cleared today.  In that week there was a 40% increase.  If I'd bought at the price i saw last week I'd have paid fees,  but gotten 40% increase on my purchase. 
I know slow and steady is really the way to go on this but it's absolutely insane for me to think about that.  40% in a week.  
'Good' investments in the typical financial world give 5 to 6 % in a year. 
Outstanding ones give double that.

I was just thinking, sweet I bought the dip, and then it dropped more. Here's to buying early. My only regret is not having more money to buy the second dip but...bills yo.

Oh. My mistake, thanks.

Sorry I'm fairly new to this,  the first seed I made was entirely random words, but can't you choose the words yourself?  I was planning on making a new wallet with picked words, with this encoding in mind.

I've been thinking about an encoding that would make it simple for me to remember my seed words, but it would require a list of the character count of each word. Where does this fall in terms of weakening my security? 
Basically I'd store the encoding in a password manager service,  and it would have two or three letters and then a list like 67584786.., etc etc.  Where each number is the number of letters in each word. 
It becomes more tedious for me to make a seed this way,  but once is made, it's very hard for me to lose. 
Is there to much insecurity in knowing that information, if someone did crack the password manager? I wouldn't even have any reference to it being crypto in my password manager,  so if someone cracked it, it would look like garbage, or at worst a password (but with 24 digits).
