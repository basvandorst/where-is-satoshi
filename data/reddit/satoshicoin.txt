It's far too early to declare victory - PoS hasn't been tested in any large scale way. As the article alludes to, what we will likely find is that PoS becomes an obscured form of PoW due to strategies like stake grinding and other methods that exploit the weaknesses of PoS.

The key takeaway is that it was a *contentious* fork. It doesn't matter which issue is causing the contention, whether it's to bail out a bad contract, or to increase the blocksize. What the Ethereum contentious hard fork has demonstrated is that two viable chains will result from the fork, both supported by strong ideological positions.

It's difficult (and perhaps impossible) to create an ASIC-resistant work function. Litecoin orginally boasted that its scrypt algorithm would keep the CPU mining dream alive, but then it too was overtaken by GPUs and then ASICs.

This type of emotional straw-man snarking is why it's so difficult to have a rational discussion about the block size issue on Reddit. This is a terrible forum for hashing out complex technical and political issues. The community really needs to sponsor a developer's/stakeholder's summit that has  the explicit purpose of coming to consensus on this issue.
@_date: 2015-12-31 19:24:12

He comes across as unknowledgable about Bitcoin as well, with his comments sounding like a word salad. What a bizarre appearance.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:18:23
It's important to distinguish between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and "blockchain" initiatives like R3CEV. 
Bitcoin is about decentralized money, whereas "blockchains" are typically about trying to be general asset registers that allow for centralized control by their creators, making them a type of shared database. 
The two couldn't be more different.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:59:38
It's interesting to note that 'bramc', the inventor of BitTorrent, is one of the participants in that IRC discussion. You know, the guy who is responsible for one of the most successful distributed computing projects in history. 
Since Bitcoin is at its heart a distributed computing project, his opinion should carry some significant weight, and deserves consideration over a one month old Reddit account who deliberately distorts the blocksize debate arguments.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:35:55

@_date: 2018-05-17 20:00:00
Eventually it will be widely realized that blockchains by themselves have a very limited range of applications. They’re only necessary for use cases that require distributed trust and censorship resistance. 
Blockchains aren’t a scaling solution for distributed databases, which is what most Blockchain companies are pursuing when you pick apart their business plans.
My hunch is that in the long run it will become clear that the only practical and truly valuable use case for blockchains is cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-02-03 04:30:25
Agreed. And really, businesses have nothing to fear as long as they remain with Core. If the miners decide to hard fork but the businesses don't follow along, the miners will find themselves mining an altcoin. No compromise is necessary, and indeed a compromise is anathema to a cryptocurrency that is attempting to resist political manipulation.

"Emergent consensus" is more of a hunch than a coherent model. As Van Wirdum writes in the article, Satoshi created Bitcoin to specifically avoid the pitfalls of relying on humans to stumble into "emergent consensus".
What will really happen is what always happens: politics and money create incentives that reduce the consensus to a few power blocs that game the system to their advantage.

@_date: 2017-02-04 18:33:49
That's disingenuous. 50% of a tiny group of mining pool operators are resisting SegWit. The vast majority of "the network" supports SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:50:48
Uh, yes. SegWit increases a block's transaction capacity, scaling it up by a factor of 2 or thereabouts. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:25:40
It wasn't safe to do so back then because of the quadratic-time  sigops problem. Hard forking to a larger blocksize back then would have left the system vulnerable to crippling DOS attacks. SegWit fixes that problem.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:40:38
There's a 2MB solution on the shelf that's just waiting for signalling. Contact your nearest miner to show your support for SegWit.

The economic majority. They will ignore invalid blocks created by hostile miners. Get it?
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:39:01
This is why all the threats by miners are wankery - the economic majority will reject their invalid blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:34:08
Plenty of wallets already support it. Regardless, thats a lame reason to not support activation. Wallets and services aren't static things - they get updated.

As stated up higher,  BU is now massively diverged from Core.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:42:53
The well-funded Bitcoin businesses should pay for a week-long developer's summit. Lock the core devs into a conference room full of provisions and don't let anyone out until they have consensus on a new block size limit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:53:32
Oh, I think you're taking about scaling in terms of number of nodes and network decentralization. Gotcha. But I don't think most people think of scaling that way.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:35:02
None of things are  "weird", lol!
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:38:51
If it is true, we have nothing to worry about anyway. That's because the Bitcoin economic majority supports Bitcoin Core. 
Nothing rallies a group of people more strongly than an attack. If the miners do this, they run the risk of the economic majority quickly switching to a new PoW algorithm, rendering the miner's hardware investments worthless.
So I encourage these simpletons to go ahead and waste their $100M. The entertainment value it will generate will be priceless.

It's crazy how much misinformation is out there about SegWit!
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:00:50
This is wrong. Nodes are critical to preventing the miners from unilaterally changing the consensus rules. They simply cannot do it without the participation of the economic majority which verifies the state of the system using their nodes.
A great recent example of this was when the Bitcoin.com pool mined an invalid block (it was too large) due to a bug in its BU node software. That block was ignored by the economic majority, and Bitcoin.com lost out on the block reward. 
So yes OP - you do help secure the network by running a node.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:05:55
It can grow with a second layer. Better to have a secure, self-sustaining base layer that establishes a foundation for higher layers, which is where microtransaction processing (lighting) or advanced smart contracts (rootstock) can get implemented.

@_date: 2017-02-19 19:27:11
If a miner starts mining larger blocks without the participation of the economic majority, their blocks will be rejected and they will be mining an altcoin. 
They first need to wait for most businesses, exchanges, block explorers, and other nodes to upgrade to BU, and that isn't going to happen.
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:35:23
It's not really "or bust". Bitcoin will hold its value proposition without SegWit.

Keep in mind, though, that Bitcoin was supposed to have been outlawed years ago already, according to early anti-Bitcoin narratives.
And it might not be so easy to outlaw, given the ramifications that would have for other value transfer media. Outlawing it might not hold up to a constitutional challenge. 
However, one could imagine plenty of bureacratic ways to hobble Bitcoin.

You're talking about a guy who convinced a passionate group of people to dedicate time to his alternate Bitcoin client project (XT), but then quickly abandoned them as he joined a banking consortium (R3CEV) that has a very different idea about individual financial freedom, who then sells his coins before making a dramatic blog post about why Bitcoin has failed (as though he has the right to speak for all of us who've dedicated years to Bitcoin), causing the price to immediately tank. He could have walked away quietly, but instead he chose to harm this community. He doesn't deserve praise, he deserves condemnation.

You have no evidence to say that the announcement of Classic is related to the dump. That's ludicrous, especially when you consider that dumps like this happen all the time for no reason. It's market chop. Some times a dump is big enough to trigger a big margin cascade, which magnifies the dump. This is normal activity.

Hearn took a few well-known problems within Bitcoin and spun them in the most pessimistic light. He even wrote blatant factual errors, such as the claim that Chinese miners were standing in the way of an increase in blocksize, even though a miners survey by contradicts that. He passed off contentious opinions as fact, as though these matters were settled.
Hearn wrote his blog post while under the employ of an organization that would benefit from Bitcoin's demise (because they could continue the narrative that only consortiums like R3CEV can pull off a successful blockchain project in the long run). That calls into serious question the partiality of his statements. Then, his post was coordinated with an uncritical New York Times puff piece, making the whole thing look like a planned attack rather than an earnest assessment.
Because of his high profile within Bitcoin, and the large soapbox upon which he shouted his claims, he willingly and maliciously caused significant damage to the reputation of the Bitcoin project, which is a blow to the countless people who've worked hard to get Bitcoin to where it is today. It was selfish and irresponsible of him to speak for all of us in that way.
This is why I say that his actions were immoral.

No - but this is a common misunderstanding. The witness data isn't segrated to a separate block or anything like that - it is actually still included in the same block along with with rest of the transaction data. In fact, each transaction's witness data is merely moved to the back part of the transaction data structure!
And the blocks can exceed 1MB in size. Not effective size or virtual size - if you measure the block it will *actually* be larger than 1MB.

I think youre talking about how different *valid* chains get selected. The chain with the most work is chosen as the canonical chain.
If BU miners create invalid chains (invalid because they contain big blocks), then PoW won't make Core nodes accept those chains. So nodes do matter.

Couldn't the alert mechanism in Core be used to alert operators? And wouldn't a constant Upgrade Now campaign on all discussion forums over three months be enough to notify other node operators who don't pay attention to node alerts?

How do you know that it's only 25%? The vast majority of nodes are still Core nodes. And we've only heard from a few businesses. As far as I can see, there's no clear picture on where the economic majority stands on this issue.
The "less than 25%" claim sounds like wishful thinking.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:05:22
Bruce, I don't think that's true. According to jtoomim, the miners are agreeable to an immediate blocksize increase to 2MB. Every developer also agrees to at least that, although core wants to wait until after SegWit is deployed. Those goals are all in the same direction. 
What's needed is a strong community leader to bring these groups together to come to an agreement on timing, and set the parameters for the next step afterwards. Frankly, I'm disappointed that Coinbase, Circle, Blockchain, KNC, Bitfinex, BTCC, etc aren't helping to make this happen.

Your scenario would be true if *all* miners decided to collude that way. However, that is an extremely unlikely scenario. 
Let's imagine instead that 66% of the hashpower colluded to raise the block subsidy to 50 BTC, which is still quite a revolt. They would basically be mining their own altcoin as their blocks get rejected by the rest of the Bitcoin economy, crucially by full nodes and exchanges such as Coinbase. The remaining hashpower would be more than sufficient to keep original Bitcoin running securely. The rebellious miners would find no takers of their blocks and they'd have to decide if they want to continue mining on a useless altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:12:27

This might be an intractable difference of worldview between the Core/non-core camps. I just want a solid, decentralized P2P cash system that can't be easily hijacked by governments or special interests. I don't care about optimizations for being a "drop-in replacement" for credit cards. I want it optimized for being an uncensorable digital bearer asset. That is what makes Bitcoin special. That is the novel capability that was missing from the world.
The core team has developed a coherent and sensible scaling plan that 80% of dozens of devopers have signed. These are the smartest guys in the field. I'm sticking with that team. 
I think a divorce may be inevitable.

@_date: 2017-03-26 21:05:45
EC removes a hard coded consensus rule (the block size limit) and replaces it with a free floating limit that is determined by miners. The miners are overly centralized right now with a handful of pool operators who would control the block size. 
Guess what they would do? They would be incentivized to raise the blocksize to push out smaller miners, and that would also have the effect of driving up nodes costs which would make it hard for home users to run nodes.
This runs counter to what a lot Core devs believe in, so there's no way that they'd contribute to BU. They'll stick with Core instead.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:43:14
Thank you, Alistair, for your thoughts on this. 
For me, the sticking point is with Emergent Consensus. I believe that it is fundamentally incompatible with the notion of a system that enforces the rules according to a predefined protocol that all participants know before jumping in, and that requires strong consensus to change. 
I don't think there's any good that can come out of compromising with a design that will break Bitcoin by necessarily leading to a mining near-monopoly, effectively handing consensus controls over to a few individuals. This is the antithesis of a cryptocurrency.
The BU project should completely rethink its consensus model from scratch if they want Core supporters to give it another look. For now, I doubt that compromise is possible.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:43:00

These weren't just understandable bugs though, they were unforgivably obvious bugs. Amateur hour bugs. And the second bug was basically a repeat of the first just a few code lines away,  meaning they didn't even do any basic review of the code after the first bug was found. The BU team is totally incompetent to have the responsibility of the system.
After those bugs were exploited, BU lost any chance it had to gain the confidence of the economic majority, and it was game over. There's no way the miners will fork now knowing that.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:02:01

That's not an argument against activating SegWit. The answer is "let's wait and see."
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:21:51
You couldn't be more wrong.
Core nodes ignore blocks that violate their programmed consensus rules. Hashpower cannot change that. Satoshi's whitepaper was talking about competing chains that contain blocks which all follow the rules.
What will Coinbase's Core node do with a 2MB block received by a miner that has 75% of the hash rate? It will reject that block. The chain the miner is creating is *invalid* according to the consensus rules. It is therefore an *altcoin*.
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:30:40
No. If AntPool actually created a block larger than one megabyte, it would get rejected by the exchanges and other economic nodes, the overwhelming majority of which are NOT running BU. Don't you understand that?

SegWit *is* a 2MB blocksize increase with malleability fix, it's already deployed on over 80% of the nodes as a softfork upgrade, and is waiting for activation. It is insanity to ignore that and hold out for another year to wait for a 2MB hard fork that confers no material benefit over SegWit and risks a network split.

@_date: 2017-03-18 07:44:52
The endgame could be to have enough hashpower to support a fork that uses Emergent Consensus while simultaneously attacking Bitcoin by mining empty blocks until Bitcoin's value drains away.
The problem with this idea is that if the mining pool is US-based,  they could be sued and a cease and desist injunction could be awarded by a judge. 
The other problem for them is that the community would be highly motivated to fork to a different PoW function.
In light of that it doesn't really seem to be a plausible scenario. 
Another possibility is that their intentions are far more benign.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:25:37
It definitely isn't nuclear... it allows miners to continue to mine valid blocks. 
A PoW function change is going nuclear, because it destroys all the miners - good ones and bad ones. And it produces fallout that could hurt Bitcoin. So let's hope we never have to use it.

I just don't see how anyone can look at the industry response to BU, the node distribution, and the reaction of the community (well, at least as i can see on this subreddit and on Twitter) and come to to conclusion that BU would be accepted by the economic majority *after miners initiate a hostile fork attempt*.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:18:49
40% of hashrate signalling for BU is mostly meaningless, because it's just signalling the preference of several individual pool operators, five or six people at most. 
They know that they cannot fork without the support of the major exchanges and businesses, so it isn't going to happen. The 40% signalling is just impotent grandstanding.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:57:19
Now who is naive?
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:41:24
It's good to be concerned about all participants, but waiting that long for all laggards to convert is a waste of time imo. Apple's approach of convert-soon-or-be-abandoned worked very well for them. I'd rather that we foster a culture of diligence rather than having to cater to people who can't be bothered to upgrade. 
Sure, there'll be sad incidents where someone spends while on the wrong chain, but the alternative is to implement a slow as molasses change cycle that alienates the community and opens the door for an altcoin to gain ground on Bitcoin, causing damage to the network effect.
I think a lot of the anger and vitriol would go away if core would just relent and announce an upgrade to 2MB targeting March for activation. It's not that big of a deal technically, and it seems to hand near unanimous support. It would be huge news sent far and wide across the ecosystem. People would be eager to convert - I seriously doubt there would be significant numbers of laggards. That risk didn't harm the ecosystem when an emergency fork was instantaneously implemented a few years ago.

None of these projects are attempting to build a decentralized bearer asset that can't be censored, or in other words, Bitcoin. A blockchain is simply one of the enabling technologies that makes Bitcoin possible. The killer app of the blockchain (which is kind of like saying "the killer app of the linked list", which is revealing) is Bitcoin. 
Decentralization is what gives Bitcoin its utility and its value. These "blockchain" projects are mostly about making old processes more efficient. Bitcoin is about changing the world by introducing a new capability.

There's still no agreed way to do a dynamic block size without it being gamed by miners.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:32:18
Most developers agree that a 2MB hard fork plus SegWit will drastically increase the resource requirements for operating a node. For example, your monthly traffic would go from 250GB to 1TB. That would certainly cause me to shut down my node. Fewer nodes means more centralization pressure. 
There are enough people opposed to this that a hard fork is guaranteed to cause a chain split, with both sides calling themselves "Bitcoin".
It's that scenario that the core devs are trying to avoid. We would be wise to recognize the danger and to proceed with SegWit first, as it offers an immediate capacity increase, and then to start tooling up for 2nd layer scaling technologies like Lightning.

if you engage BU supporters for long enough, you'll notice a thread of anti-intellectualism running through their arguments, along with tenacious dogmatic (and incorrect) beliefs about  *Satoshi's true vision*. 
They treat the white paper like it's scripture. They ignore what Satoshi actually *did* and choose instead to interpret what he wrote in the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:09:23
You'd expect hundreds of humans to restart nodes  distributed over a period of time, not all in sync.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:09:31
Miners only order transactions into blocks. Hey aren't the authority of the the protocol. If 90% of the ecosystem is running Core, it doesn't matter if 100% of the miners are running BU - they'll not dare to break the rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:09:59
More accurately, the name Bitcoin refers to the current consensus rules. A small number of miners don't get to change that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:39:13
4MB is too large, as it will certainly reduce the number of nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:13:37
I dont think you can call implementing a fast relay network for miners when you're barely out of your teens *acting your age*.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:25:10
I always thought it was just a lighthearted way of saying that he preached a lot about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:50:57
And BU supporters think that this has a chance of getting adopted by the community? What a joke.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:12:26
The exchanges have provided clear guidance on that. All BU has to do is add replay protection and fork. Then they'll be listed as BTU.
This is a nice clean way forward that lets both polarized groups do their own thing.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:42:41
Charlie is awesome. The money laundering charges were a steaming pile of bullshit.

The BU crowd doesn't understand this "base level security" that you speak of.

Well he didn't say anything - he's clearly leaving the option open and given his history of hating on Core it's obvious which way he's leaning.

You're not participating in this conversation in good faith.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:33:50

Well we're not necessarily dealing with rational actors on the mining side of things.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:12:35
 No, the issue is that BU is incompetent.

I don't think he's a liar and I think he has good intentions. He just seems to be easily bamboozled. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:49:01
Roger fancies himself to be an expert in economics. He always goes on about how so-and-so clearly doesn't understand some issue in Bitcoin, because he just doesn't get economics, *man*.
But Roger is a fool if he believes that Bitcoin can only be viewed through the lens of Austrian economics. Sorry Roger but  Bitcoin sits at the confluence of multiple technical and social disciplines - you can't plan or judge its future based solely on the one thing that you know kinda well (what *are* Roger's economic creds anyhow).
And really - his cheap shot at Charlie is pathetic and only serves to further isolate him from more moderate voices. What a sad character he's become.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:42:52
Without exchanges, BTU will not have access to liquidity, which means that it will be worth less than dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:16:20
No, it was specifically an appeal to the BU devs to implement replay protection and wipeout protection. The letter said nothing about the Core devs.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:55:26
We tried that two years ago (being nice) and it was met with downvoting and disinformation campaigns. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:21:47
Thank you, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:56:24
Yes. Why would they have to do anything? It's the miners who would be sweating as their invalid blocks get rejected by the economic majority. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:24:11
And it should be said that it's "Nakamoto consensus" as the BU crowd has misinterpreted it from a small paragraph in Satoshi's whitepaper. The EC philosophy seems to arise from what's essentially become religious dogma.
Don't believe me? Head over to and dare to suggest that "longest chain wins" refers to how contention between two chains that *follow the same rules* gets resolved, which is the way it works in the Satoshi client.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:51:55
Then why is he blocking SegWit, which provides larger blocks and paves the way for LN? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:32:49


Ideally, everyone would want to do this, because that's kinda the whole point of Bitcoin. You run your own node to ensure that your money isn't getting fucked with.
Don't let these people tell you that running a node is worthless, folks - they're lying.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:11:33
Another deflection! Let's stay on point. If BU had been widely deployed, the price would be plummeting right now.
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:11:52
He's making the point that you don't have to eat something horrible like spleen (or blocks with a 50 btc coinbase) just because it's put in front of you by your mother (or miners). He's just humorously making his point by bitterly recalling an awful childhood experience. I thought it was funny!
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:07:33
The "Core team" was a few individuals who represented themselves and had no ability to represent the entire Core community of developers. This Hong Kong agreement nonsense is insane.

What do you think Core client does with invalid blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:17:32
Seriously. This is like the altcoin plague from a few years ago. This sub is about Bitcoin, not private ledgers that share a data structure with Bitcoin.

Agreed... there isn't even any bloody "classic" code yet.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:13:16
Why not at least support the next step in scaling, SegWit, which provides some immediate relief and moves us forward without any hardfork risk?
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:10:56
Core is running the original consensus rules. And I'd love to hear what you think  the "original idea" of Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:59:13
That fact that you can't be downvoted into oblivion is a huge plus.

No it won't.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:41:33
Core always has the option of changing its work function to escape that.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:37:16
No: the exchanges have plainly stated they they **will not list a BU chain** unless BU implements replay protection and wipeout protection. BU refuses to do this. So they can forget about being listed at all.
However, even if they *do* abide by the exchanges' conditions, the BU chain will be listed as BTU, not BTC. Just another altcoin. There's no way that BU can replace Core under those conditions.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:55:08
Bitcoin wasn't "designed" to hardfork into incompatible chains. 
This is where the BU side totally misunderstands Satoshi's white paper, which states that nodes select the longest *valid* chain. Get that? **valid** chain, as in all the contentious chains **follow the same rules**.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:58:19
Ah, apologies then.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:37:55
Updated estimate is now 2.1MB based on current transaction mix.

It is relevant. Bitcoin is a cypherpunk project through and through with clear origins in that movement.

I'm pretty sure that's false - Voorhees made his own BTC fortune on par with Ver's and he certainly doesn't need a boss.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:38:33
Charlie's conviction was bullshit IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:19:37
Why do you think that SegWit is not a scaling option? I find that confusing.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:22:55
Bitcoin will grow in layers. Full blocks are a good thing.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:58:42
Keep deflecting
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:59:55
Agreed! Ver has stated that they'll fork with only 60% of hash power behind them. They're willing to wreck fortunes at such a low consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:09:00
It makes Ver look guilty. I trust jratcliff.

@_date: 2017-03-23 05:07:04
It doesn't matter at all. Miners aren't going to fork without the support of the exhanges. Jihan Wu is bluffing.

@_date: 2017-03-17 08:41:43
That 1.7MB estimate is outdated - a newer estimate is 2MB based on the current mix of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:18:43
The mining centralization problem has finally bit us in the ass. It turns out that one man controls a majority of the hashrste and he has a veto on protocol upgrades. This is why BU's emergent consensus is madness - it makes the problem even worse!
I think we need a new PoW to totally reboot mining.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:03:08
The most-work on a *valid* chain. A chain with blocks larger than 1MB isn't Bitcoin, and will be listed as an altcoin on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:07:14
Highly doubtful.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:19:08
Node count is over 90% Core. Yes, there might Sybils in there, but clearly they can't all be Sybils. 
Then there are the exchanges. The industry letter states that the BU chain isn't going to be treated as the automatic successor to the Core chain merely because it has the majority hash rate (and it will be listed as an altcoin, if and only if, BU implements replay protection). I take that as compelling evidence that a very important part of the Bitcoin economy is less than enthusiastic about BU.
Those are imperfect measurements to be sure, but they're strong indicators.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:32:19
They're meta tokens I believe. Basically they allow you to make a bet on which chain will be dominant after a year. The original "BTC" ticker remains.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:05:12
Well then we have nothing to worry about, because BU will never be run by the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:49:40
Longest chain is what the node software says it is, and the vast majority of nodes reject blocks larger than one million bytes. No matter how much hash rate was used to make the block.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:04:26
Ah so they're in sync. Colluding, if you will. 
 
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:02:07
Wait until Dash is at Bitcoin's usage level and value, having survived numerous crises and attacks, and then we'll talk.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:27:37
Nodes validate the blocks created by miners. If the miners want to change the rules, they need to do that with the participation of the nodes, otherwise their blocks will be rejected by the economic majority and will be worthless.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:44:56
You activated a node with a miner-controlled blocksize because of unpleasant moderation on @_date: 2017-03-15 17:46:02
But why? that involved individuals, not Core as a group. 
Even if you disagree with that, Core delivered a real capacity increase to 2MB, but done as a safe soft fork instead of a dangerous hard fork. Why would anyone be against that?
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:41:47
The economic majority determines who "wins" by choosing the software to run. That's all that matters in the end. So far, Core is winning by a mile.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:27:18
The blocksize issue has little to do with storage capacity. 
For miners, the issue is with block propagation and validation delays (higher delays make it easier for malicious miners/cartels to dominate mining). For node operators, the issue is with bandwidth - the more bandwidth a node requires, the fewer operators there will be due to the cost. 
These are centralizing pressures. If Bitcoin becomes too centralized, it becomes vulnerable to a government takeover. And then it becomes pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:29:24
Perhaps too strong a phrase. Control of the reference client.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:13:55
But... it's cutting off your nose to spite your face. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:18:18
You need to stop reading the scriptures.
The exchange Core nodes won't accept blocks larger than one million bytes. That is user power. Mining hash power cannot do anything about that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:50:00
This is laughable. Is this your understanding of the system? Seriously??
If the exchanges and businesses reject blocks that are larger than 1MB, it doesn't matter how much work is behind them!
 Bitfinex will list BTC as the chain that is validated by their Core client. BTU will be the chain that is validated by the BU client (if they bother to list BTU at all). End of story.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:16:46
Interesting idea... 
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:53:40
It's also ignorant of how data networks scale: in layers. Not surprising since BU is founded on gross ignorance.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:54:26
He had a high profile - he's been very active in forums, conferences, interviews, etc. He had a big soap box. It would be like a senior VP at Google writing a doom-and-gloom blog post coordinated with an uncritical New York Times puff piece about how Google had fatal organizational issues, using the most pessimistic and fact-bending spin possible. That would tank Google's stock price. That's analagous to what Hearn did to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:56:15
Blah blah blah same old nonsense and lies from you.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:13:05
That's a lame criticism. How do you know what their qualifications are? These are people who come from different backgrounds and careers. How do you know that there aren't any economists amongst them, or that they've learned economics along the way? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:45:36
That is indeed ominous. What is a non-critical consensus factor? I bet he's thinking about the block reward.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:09:45
Sarcastic and facetious tweets aren't necessarily trolling. I find them entertaining and I find that he's mostly correct.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:36:53
The requirement for a "2MB non-witness space" is irrational. SegWit already provides for a real increase in transactional capacity. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:55:54
That's already possible! If the miners would signal for SegWit in heir blocks, it will activate in most of the Core nodes within a week, and we will have an immediate capacity upgrade to 2MB.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:28:52
Because BU's Emergent Consensus will hand control of the consensus parameters to a mining cartel, it will result in double-spend attacks and DoS attacks, and the governance structure isn't open source. just to begin with.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:16:36
It would take months to prepare, deploy and activate at a predermined blockheight (otherwise there's the risk of a significant network split). 
Meanwhile people are screaming for lower fees, which SegWit can help with nearly immediately. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:25:13
I'm sorry, but this is really unnecessary and only adds to the drama.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:04:34
I see! Yes they are and sorry for misinterpreting.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:14:39
I don't think we have much to worry about from BU anymore. Sentiment is too negative against them now. They've lost their chance.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:05:38
This is yet another reason why it would be prudent to have an alternate work function ready to go.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:35:54
So you wouldn't put on a bandaid because it doesn't stop the bleeding? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:41:46
The compromise is SegWit which bridges the divide beween the 2MB Bitcoin Classic proponents and the small-block/fix-malleability proponents.
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:21:44
Sure, but the BU fork will be listed as 'BTU', i.e. an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:36:55
Emergent Consensus would destroy Bitcoin. It is broken, full stop.
Edit: or did I misread sarcasm? Hard to tell these days
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:08:11
But 500 nodes would not instantly turn on at the same time. Come on you're grasping at straws.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:08:13
They don't care about what the community wants because they're only considering mining hashpower as their backing for a fork. Hashpower represents a tiny fraction of the community.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:20:45
You're right - it can be both, by segregating these use cases into different protocol layers (Bitcoin base layer/Lightning), which is congruent with designs like tcp/ip.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:53:56
Sigh. Hard forking to 2MB right now is totally nuts because of A) lack of consensus, B) the quadratic-time sigops problem and C) the length of time it would take to safely deploy the hard fork. On the other hand, SegWit is ready for activation.
How many times does this have to be repeated? It's like there's a knowledge force field surrounding that prevents it from learning the truth.
@_date: 2016-01-14 06:33:49
You can't "trust your commerce" to "such a restrained system?" You mean the system that has been steadily transferring value between Internet users without trusted intermediaries for the last 7 years, and isn't in any imminent danger of stopping? Pray tell what use case you have that you can "no longer trust" to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:12:25
SegWit paves the way for Lightning, which will allow for a higher transaction rate. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:23:07
You're wrong - the article has reiterated the points of the Core scaling roadmap quite nicely.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:01:34
SegWit has gone through an extensive and lengthy vetting process. 
It is not "too complex" either - that's a laughable criticism that could only be made out of ignorance.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:00:47
How do you compromise with a single dominant miner who refuses to allow Bitcoin to upgrade its transaction capacity? Jihan is against LN and  SegWit. 
And then there's the horror show of Emergent Consensus, a radical new model that invites severe DOS and double-spend attacks, and grants control of the block size to the mining cartel. This is madness! I ask you, how do you compromise with something so fundamentally wrong? 
(and I'm also a long time holder, circa 2011, with a significant investment in Bitcoin)
@_date: 2016-01-23 05:56:54
Of course, ethereum will also have its own governance problems. This phenomenon isn't unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:43:20
Sorry but you are confused.
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:39:20
SegWit is a brilliant way to increase transaction capacity while simultaneously solving transaction malleability and the quadratic-time sigops problem. All without splitting the network. And it's available right now if the miners would cooperate!
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:04:48
He must have had a powerful orgasm at the news.
 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:28:56
Exactly - if the miners are all-knowing and benevolent, then surely we must trust them with all the consensus parameters. After all, hash power makes right!
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:19:02
BU's fork is now 4 releases and hundreds of commits behind Core. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:58:20
If you support Emergent Consensus, which is premised on a batshit interpretation of the white paper, then you are crazy.
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:12:02
Ok, but the core development team hasn't been doing the censoring. The moderator of this sub has been doing that.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:24:13
It's in the freakin title!
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:04:34
No, this is totally incorrect. A new chain that breaks the current consensus rules will be listed as an altcoin, whereas BTC will still be the current chain. There's no reason to believe that exchanges will assign the label "BTC" to a chain with different rules simply because it has more hashpower.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:24:15
BU nodes upset that balance of power by loosening validation checks. 
Basically when you run a BU node, you pull your pants down and grab your ankles, and whistle to the miners to come and get it!
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:14:44
It is actually a blocksize increase. A block filled with SegWit transactions can be up to 4MB in size. The witness data is part of the block too.
It's really surprising how poorly this is understood by SegWit critics.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:37:06
SW *is* the compromise. A hardfork will take a year to prepare safely. SegWit could be activated in two weeks if the miners would stop playing games and start signalling for it.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:16:24
Yeah and they also believe that hashpower can force nodes to accept different consensus rules ("nakamoto consensus" - LOL), so it's best to ignore crazy people.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:08:55
thats a lot of people....
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:01:37
Man, the r-btc brigade is all over your comment. Look at those suspicious upvotes!
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:32:37
Because it's a non-binding signal. It doesn't automatically trigger anything. 
It's just a way for a few pool operators to say "We may or may not be running BU. Were threatening to use it to fork to large blocks."
Without the support of the economic majority (business and user nodes), their threat isn't credible. 
So aside from a toothless threat, it's meaningless.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:55:56
They seem to have a problem with the truth, don't they?
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:38:26
Roger definitely doesn't understand economics the way he boasts about if he thinks that his dump will damage Bitcoin.
Also I wonder if he realizes that the more he threatens,  the more community resolve he builds against his position?
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:54:27
The miners are effectively employees of the system who order transactions into valid blocks. It's the economic majority that defines Bitcoin and validates or rejects miner's blocks. Miners aren't  early as powerful as believes (they seem to be totally misinformed about Bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-01-14 06:42:24
That sounds like that would still be working for you right now. I'm sure that transaction would clear in under an hour for less than 5 cents. A growth plan is already in place to deal with 350k trx/d and beyond, but we're not anywhere close to that anyway. Even when the system was under a heavy spam attack, all you had to do was add a couple of cents to your transactions to get them added to a block.
 I just don't see how your use case squares with your idea that Bitcoin is inadequate to deal with it.

Banks would never create an actual cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. What they would create is a centrally controlled digital currency, because no bank is going to issue something that has their name on it, but that they can't control. There's no point to it. And since there's already a global digital centrally-controlled currency (USD), they wouldn't be creating anything new or interesting.

It's much, much worse in r-btc. There's a much better chance that you'll get the truth over here.

Ok - so you have no use for cryptocurrency at all then. That's OK, it's not for everybody. It's for people who want or need to be able to store and transfer value without needing to ask for permission or without fear of it getting confiscated. 
The reasons range from needing to sidestep a repressive regime to wanting to avoid a bank bail-in to simply wanting monetary sovereignty. 
If you care about those things then Bitcoin is the most censorship resistant form of value on the net, but if you don't then you can simply use the existing electronic payment methods which are vastly superior to any cryptocurrency.

To be clear: Voorhees did NOT say that all it would take is majority hash. He said that they would CONSIDER listing the BU chain as BTC if it became the **dominant** chain,  not merely the chain with majority hash power.
What is dominant? Dunno, but it would include a sense of what the community has chosen.  But it is important to understand that he committed ShapeShift to listing the BU chain as "BTU" to begin with.
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:28:17
If indeed they're actually running BU. After that major BU bug that caused the Bitcoin.com pool to mine an invalid block and lose 13BTC, it would be pretty dumb to risk running  BU.
Regardless, 25% of the hash power signalling for BU doesn't infer "success." A truly successful client is one that is adopted by the economic majority, and in that respect BU is a major flop.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:22:49

Yep... it's a fantasy that the exchanges would take on that kind of risk - making a bet on whether or not the economic majority would come to see the BU chain as "bitcoin",  never mind the risk of handing  control of Bitcoin over to a small semi-private, non-transparent, and unqualified group of people. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:55:51

If he truly thought that SegWit was a good idea, he would signal for it on his own mining pool, since activating it has no real downsides.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:27:37
There's no support from the economic majority. 
When the exchanges publish a letter that says "we require BU to implement replay and wipeout protection before well list it", you need to start suspecting that maybe there's not terribly strong support for BU.
Further, when those same exchanges say that even if BU meets their conditions, they will list it with the ticker "BTU" which makes is just another altcoin, not Bitcoin. That again is extremely strong evidence that a major part of the business community isn't supporting BU in its goal to replace Bitcoin.
And then you have the fact that 97% of listening and non-listening nodes are not running BU. Thats a large enough majority - many thousands of nodes - that a "but Sybils!" argument doesn't hold water.
BU just doesn't have significant community support.
The miners won't fork without that support, even if they have 75% hashrate.

Kinda sad given that BU hands the blocksize over to miners to manipulate at will. Miners' interests are diverged from the interests of users, so you could even see the blocksize decrease.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:53:43
You're being disingenuous. They want to disrupt the hashrate-minority chain - the chain desired and supported by the users and businesses - by mining empty blocks in an attempt to force people to switch to the BU chain. That's called a DOS attack.
Satoshi never discussed DOSing a chain that is voluntarily chosen by the economic majority. Sorry, but attacking people isn't going to convince them to follow your consensus-breaking chain.
If the miners choose extortion as the their best path forward, they will soon find themselves on the wrong side of a POW function change.

Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, is especially qualified to understand the differences between a valid and invalid chain. 
Oh well, you've made up your mind that black = white, not much more to say.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:01:52
It's not making up new rules, it's just how it works. If users and businesses don't replace their nodes with the BU client, they're making a choice to stay on the original chain. 
The exchanges have stated loud and clear that they will not swap their Core clients for BU clients, instead they will list BU separately as an altcoin. There's no constraint on them from making that choice freely. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:01:33
There's no path to *Visa-scale* other than an L2 solution. It seems obvious to me that handling hundreds or thousands of TPS at L2 will necessarily keep blocks at L1 jam-packed with high-fee open/closing transactions. So much so that L1 will require a much higher capacity than it does today as well.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:32:36
It really isn't terribly complex, and the risk has been mitigated through extensive review and testing. It's not a great argument against SegWit.

SegWit already provides for larger blocks (literally -  not effectively or whatever, but an actual blocksize increase) and it does it without risking a hard fork. It seems pretty clear at this point the BU faction is hell bent on ignoring this and that they are committed to an unsafe hardfork. It's frustrating as hell because it's so unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:27:45
The Core project isn't going to change the consensus rules just because a majority of the hashrate starts mining invalid blocks.

It's weird  that "settlement" is a dirty word around here. Everywhere else in the world it's a good thing. 
Cash = settlement. All "settlement" means in the Bitcoin context is that it's a more viable use case than a high throughput payments network.

"Emergent consensus" is a broken idea right out of the gate. It not only breaks the current consensus-keeping system, it puts it in a blender and lights it on fire. 
It invites attacks like the median EB attack that will almost certainly result in endless chain reorgs and lost money. It will lead to increased mining centralization as miners are incentivized to kill off competitors by manipulating the blocksize at their whim. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:45:19

The Bitcoin community has resisted the urge to censor its ledger several times. The culture here is much more invested in the ideals of censorship resistance and permissionless value transfer.
It's surprising to me how quickly Ethereum's community agreed to censorship - or perhaps I shouldn't be, given the stake in the DAO that some Ethereum foundation members are rumored to have. Foundation members were quick to push for censorship, which pratically guaranteed success due to their enormous influence.
The Bitcoin community does't have a central figure with as much pull as Vitalik Buterin, so we can also be thankful for that.

One CPU = one vote was for when every node was a miner. The situation is much different now. 
Nodes still retain power by validating transactions. If you don't believe this is important, just ask yourself what happens when Bitfinex's Core node receives an invalid block from a miner (hint: it throws it out).
 So nodes obviously do have a "vote" in that they act as the gateways to the Bitcoin network for users and businesses, which means that they collectively define the network consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:12:03
It's the one that is compatible with the nodes run by the economic majority. Nodes through which genuine transactions are made, not Sybils (you can't Sybil genuine economic activity anyway).

It was morons like Roger Ver - people who didn't understand that Bitcoin is about censorship resistance and not cheap payments - who promoted the idea of Bitcoin being a replacement for Visa.
The cypherpunks, on the other hand, have been consistent in saying that Bitcoin's primary purpose is censorship resistance, and that censorship resistance will always be expensive due to the inherent costs of decentralization!

90% of a dozen or so mining pool operators (individuals) and a small room full of business owners support the 2x fork. 
The rest of the community, including the open source Core development community and major exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and Gemini, do not. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:35:35

@_date: 2017-08-18 09:14:32
Lol, no it is not. Bitcoin is determined by the economic majority of node operators, and the NYA appears to fall very short of that.
Nakamoto consensus refers to the longest chain (actually, most-work) winning out over other chains that *all follow the same consensus rules*.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:28:40
The most likely outcome is for a significant portion of the 2X hashrate to defect back to the original chain once they notice that it's maintaining its value over the new chain. Then it's game-over for the takeover attempt. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:04:45
Some hashrate is likely to defect back to the original chain within hours or days. Hodlers can wait it out as we don't transact on-chain very often. Off-chain users would be mostly unaffected.
If hashrate does not return, a PoW or difficulty change would garner wide community support. That is preferable to having Bitcoin commandeered by a small group of mining pool and business operators.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:00:52
In the end it's the users who decide which node software to transact through.

Capacity is increased without modifying the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant, thereby preserving the consensus rules and avoiding a potentially dangerous hard fork. Stop obsessing over MAX_BLOCK_SIZE. 
With SegWit, blocks will be able carry more transactions, and blocks will *actually* be larger than one megabyte. If you count all the bytes in a block that's loaded with SegWit transactions, you will notice that it exceeds one megabyte.

"Core" is a community of developers. The Bitcoin economic majority has chosen to run the node software produced by that community. It's the economic majority that decides what is Bitcoin, not Core. People who criticize Core don't seem to realize that they're actually criticizing the economic majority.
It's the economic majority that creates the chain value,  NOT the miners. Hashrate follows price, always and forever. It doesn't matter one bit that 92% of mining hashrate are beating their chests about 2x. They will mine the chain that is valued by the economic majority, end of story.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:21:17
The economic majority - you know, the nodes and users that transact through them that actually give Bitcoin its value - does not support 2X. 
What the miners support is irrelevant because it's the economic nodes that set the rules and that accept or reject the blocks created by miners.

It's going to yo-yo back and forth.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:25:10
For a short period of time perhaps. But since most of the community doesn't want a small group of business and mining pool operators to commandeer Bitcoin, we'll wait out the attack.
 Hodlers don't have to do anything, and off-chain users would be unaffected. Some hashrate would eventually defect back to the original chain when it becomes clear that Bitcoin proper is retaining its value and is thus more profitable to mine.
This is an ideological battle, and the incentives favor the economic majority, not the miners and Barry Silbert's DCG.

False equivalence. A group of corporations are attempting a hostile takeover of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can never get any more convenient to use than pinless debit or tap-to-pay cards. As far as fees are concerned, by the time you layer on a processing service like BitPay (most merchants won't interface with the network directly for a variety of reasons), there isn't a significant savings.
What makes Bitcoin an interesting form of money is that it's a digital store of value that can't be censored. In order for it to retain the "can't be censored" part, its distribution and clearing mechanism must remain as decentralized as possible. That requirement is in tension with the desire for cheap and fast payments.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:42
But his evangelism was based on a complete misunderstanding of the technology and its unique promise. 
Ver thought that it as all about cheap payments, and he spread that message far and wide. He’s the reason so many people believe this! The technical people knew that Bitcoin had fundamental scaling issues since day 1, but Roger always handwaved that concern away.
But the truth was always that Bitcoin’s value proposition is censorship and inflation resistance - a sound store of value. That truth has caught up with Roger and he can’t handle it.

@_date: 2015-08-19 21:00:10
The issue goes deeper than nodes. Larger block sizes create mining centralization pressure because of the time it takes to transmit a block. Miners compete to get their blocks accepted by the network first, and every second counts. To compensate for larger blocks, miners will acquire access to the best internet connection points, and they will also tend towards increasingly-centralized block distribution schemes that will lock out the little guy. 
If this centralization effect runs away without compensating controls (limited block size), the network might become so centralized as to become basically pointless, if you believe that the entire premise of Bitcoin is to enable decentralized Internet money.

BCH could easily have blocks polluted with low-value cruft, such as application signaling (remember satoshidice?) or media storage, NOT genuine value transfers. That's what the author means by "unbounded demand." It doesn't have to be wildly successful to get there.
Ethereum's blockchain has already surpassed Bitcoin's in size, and yet it's worth far less than Bitcoin's. The ETH blockchain is stuffed with contract noise, and its node count will drop precipitously as the blockchain rapidly ascends into the terabytes. 
So the same thing will likely happen to BCH - rapidly filled gigantic blocks, but low economic usage, and thus low overall value.

It's primarily a bandwidth issue, which makes running a full node too expensive for many people. A node today uses about 300GB/month, which blows a lot of data caps. This means that fewer nodes will be run.
 It is also an issue of block propagation times. Entities that can transmit blocks to the network the fastest before their rivals (and that race might be won by milliseconds) will get their blocks confirmed first. That incentive creates an arms race that leads to centralization. So it is not as simple a matter as storage space.

Ethereum supporters might think that R3 and the like will be using the Ethereum chain, but as Ripple found out (and it's really obvious when you think about it), the big boys are going to use their own chain(s).
Anyway, R3 isn't a threat because they're not trying to build a cryptocurrency. They're trying to build "permissioned ledgers" or some buzzworthy nonsense like that. They're on an entirely different tangent of "blockchain technology" than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a decentralized digital bearer asset that is censorship-resistant (aka "peer to peer cash"). Big bank consortiums cannot create such a thing, because to do so would be to create something that they can't control, and they would never risk that. And so far, they've shown no interest in it.
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:30:27
If you don't have a need for a censorship-resistant store of value, then you probably don't need Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

The idea that miners decide the rules is a religious belief promoted in A simple thought experiment shows it to be false:
What will the Core nodes operated by Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Poloniex, Bitpay, and BTCC do with a block that breaks the consensus rules? 
Answer: they will ignore that block. The miner who created that block can then decide if he wants to continue building on it, thereby bravely switching to his own personal altcoin, or if he would prefer mining the chain that's actually supported by the economic majority.

@_date: 2018-11-25 11:15:53
True, there are far fewer existential risks today than there were in 2011. 
Back then, nobody knew if governments wouldn’t outright ban Bitcoin or close all the exchanges. 
There was a serious concern that an unforeseen weakness in the design would be exploited and permanently destroy confidence in the entire concept.
There wasn’t investment money floating around and very poor liquidity. There were no derivatives markets and the few spot markets (mostly Mt Gox) would routinely crash in the middle of large volume spikes.
The number of people maintaining an interest after the crash and keeping the pilot light on was much much smaller than the size of the community today.
If bitcoin could rebound under those circumstances, why would it be worse now?

1) False - UASF BIP148 got SegWit activated. Or do you think the NYA timing was a mere coincidence? They knew that come Aug 1st, an incentive bomb to switch to the SegWit chain was going to be activated, so they (NYA participants) had no choice but to pretend that they were in control of the process.
2) After the fork, the most valuable chain (the original chain) will draw mining defectors from the NYA and the whole attack will disintegrate.
3) NYA/2X was the result of closed-door meetings between a small minority of Bitcoin companies (mostly associated with Barry Silbert's DCG). Only a single Core community developer was present (Eric Lombrozo), and his advice was ignored and dismissed. The majority of economic nodes, including major exchanges like Bitfinex, Poloniex, Gemini, and  Bitstamp, DO NOT support 2X.
To say that that 2X is an "industry wide compromise" is more than a little disingenuous!

It won't be any technically better since it's merely a doubling of the max allowable weight per block. 
The main problem with SegWit2X is the process through which it was conceived: closed door meetings that excluded the development community. This was not a consensus-building process done in good faith, but rather an attempt to impose changes to the system in a manner of a corporate cartel.
It would set a terrible precedent if a small group of business CEOs could impose a top-down change on the system. I believe that their effort will fail, as all previous out-of-consensus hard fork attempts have failed. But that's not assured, which is why anyone who cares about the openness and censorship-resistance  should be voicing their dissent to the NYA participants.

Remember that you're also continuously relaying those blocks to peers. You're off by many terabytes. It's about bandwidth, not storage. A fast storage device to handle the heavy I/O demands of big blocks is also a consideration. A basic consumer-grade drive won't cut it. And if you want to use the machine for other purposes while iit works in the background, it'll require good CPUs.
$20k is an exaggeration (that figure was actually a rhetorical point given by Craig Wright), but the point is that node operating costs are directly proportional to block size. It necessarily then follows that larger block sizes reduce the number of participating nodes. Fewer nodes = more centralization = less censorship resistance.

According to this logic, the miners could collude to change the 21 million coin limit, and Xapo would call that Bitcoin as long as the chain has the most work. But they would have to willingly reassign the BTC symbol to the miner's new node software to surrender like that.  Otherwise they  would be protected from such attacks by simply letting their node reject the invalid blocks.
Xapo.... this is stupid and dishonest, and you deserve to go out of business.

If you have lots of time and not much money, then by all means hack together a solution that provides the same capabilities as 21's device.
As someone who would rather spend his time programming instead of futzing around with a raspberry pi and my own mining chip and what not, I think 21's computer is an attractive solution. 
They've put together a nice hardware and software package that expresses their vision of a Bitcoin-enabled agent, and they'll support it moving forward. That's easily worth a measly 400 bucks. I would probably burn a lot more than that in terms of hours spent screwing around building it myself.

By not signalling bit 1, what they really want is their own version of SegWit, probably one that preserves covert Asicboost, and one that perhaps has other benefits for the parties involved.

The beautiful thing about it is that the economic incentives are aligned for the high capacity, bug-fixing SegWit chain and against the low-capacity legacy chain. So while majority mining support would be ideal, it's not ultimately necessary for SegWit chain to take over.

It doesn't make sense to talk about efficiency in relation to PoW. It's as expensive as it needs to be for miners to compete for the rewards.
 It doesn't matter if SHA256 ASICs become 1000% more efficient or a magical quantum device starts turning out a trillion hashes for a billionth of a joule.

SegWit was the compromise. Now they pretend to support SegWit... but oh guess what, not a version of SegWit that's compatible with the deployed version. Garzik's acknowledgement of BIP91 is nice but I highly doubt Wu will agree to it.

It's inferior to SegWit, which converts the limit to a block weight metric that incentivizes a smaller UTXO set, fixes transaction malleability which makes 2nd layer scaling solutions more practical, and is activated with a safe soft fork instead of a dangerous hard fork (and a naive hard fork leaves people exposed to replay attacks and chain wipeouts).
@_date: 2015-10-20 05:24:56

@_date: 2017-05-31 15:51:17
They're overly conservative on this issue. It's out of their hands now - the users will solve this. We either attempt to activate SegWit or let Bitcoin stagnate. A chain split is worth the risk, and I say that as a holder going on 6 years. Worst case scenario is we all end up with two sets of coins, one more valuable than the other, and one with SegWit activated on it. Sure there'd be market uncertainty, but not for long.

The narrative, and the funding, will eventually swing back towards Bitcoin as these various "blockchain technology" efforts fail to demonstrate broad utility, and it becomes clear that the most compelling application of a blockchain is peer to peer cash. 
Bitcoin is about censorship-free money, first and foremost. That's the revolution. The blockchain is merely an enabling data structure. 
Blockchains are certainly interesting, and maybe some private use-cases such as interbank settlement can be made more efficient using them, but that pales in comparison to what Bitcoin is: a way for people to store and transfer scarce and valuable digital tokens over the Internet without requiring permission or fearing censorship. Banks, nor any private entity, can ever reproduce that, no matter what sub component of Bitcoin technology they latch on to.

Another way of looking at the price drop is that the rise to $1000 was an extreme bubble, led by Chinese speculators, pumped by a huge amount of press coverage, and possibly helped along by a suspicious purchasing bot ("willy") on Mt.

In other words, SegWit2x was a lot of bluster but it amounts to SegWit proper getting activated.

I remember when Gavin started turning toxic... it was when he began that series of alarmist blog posts explaining the urgency behind needing to raise the blocksize limit. He had been egged on to do this by Mike Hearn who had convinced Gavin that Bitcoin required a benevolent dictator to move forward.
Gavin's reasoning for an increase was faulty and he used the outcome of some naive and poorly constructed tests on his own computer as evidence that the system could handle larger blocks, totally ignoring the network latency, block propagation, and validation time issues. 
He energized a contingent of the community into demanding an immediate and reckless response from the Core development community. When that wasn't forthcoming, Gavin and crew came up with BitcoinXT, which is when all hell broke loose and the community tore in half.
Amir's assessment of the people involved was correct - he seemed to know who was a friend and who was an enemy of  Bitcoin before anyone else.

Lol, no, btc1 does not become the new reference client. Miners don't even need btc1 to execute BIP91 - they only need James Hiiliard's simple BIP91 patch for Core. 
 Even if mining pools install btc1 (and they would be crazy to do so because of bugs which means a high potential for lost revenue),  they are just a tiny percentage of nodes in the ecosystem. They can't go ahead with a 2x hard fork unless the economic node majority also runs btc1, which isn't going to happen.

We're merely forcing the miners to uphold their promise to activate SegWit.

I doubt the fork would have succeeded without Vitalik's implicit support. It certainly would have failed had he come out against it. That kind of influence is a form of centralized control.

Would you mind explaining your definition of a "ponzi"? Because by the common definition, Bitcoin is nothing like a ponzi, unless you believe that any commodity with a fluctuating value is a ponzi.

Bitcoin's network effect isn't directly coupled to its transaction capacity at the base protocol layer.

BIP148 **forced** the miners to activate SegWit,  because if the miners didn't activate SegWit, BIP148 would have done it anyway. 
BIP148 merely enforces BIP141, which is a soft fork, so any miners not coming along for the ride would have been at risk of getting wiped out in a chain reorg should the SegWit chain overtake the original chain.  The incentives are strong for the community to more highly value the SegWit chain, and since hashrate follows price, enough miners would defect to the SegWit chain to make a wipeout scenario highly possible.
BIP148 was great game theory, and it worked. It didn't stop the NYA participants from taking credit for the work of the Core devs, unfortunately.

Yep, Ethereum is due for more Mt. Gox moments. It already failed its first censorship-resistance test (the DAO hard fork mulligan orchestrated by Vitalik). These ICOs are setting the stage for Ethereum's next giagantic disaster that will make the Mt. Gox event itself look tame in comparison.
And that's not even considering the inevitable technical disasters that will occur almost necessersily due to Ethereum's complexity and huge attack surface.

If the Internet was scaled the way the big Big Blockers wanted (those fine people over in application traffic would be sent at the IP layer and that’s it. To deal with scaling they’d just increase the MTU or something. That’s their vision.

Did they have a choice?

If the exchanges would just bloody come out for or against bip 148, at least we could resolve the uncertainty. Even better would be prediction markets.

Weak. PEDDaL superficially resembles the Bitcoin blockchain, but crucially, it's missing proof-of-work and a decentralized system of verifying nodes. The chain-of-hashes concept by itself isn't what makes a blockchain interesting.

BIP 148 UASF is already working in that it forced the miners to agree to activate SegWit by August. By continuing with BIP 148, we will ensure that they do.
 And then a hard fork afterwards is still up to the community - we don't have to accept the "2x" part of the plan. 
SegWit2X doesn't set any kind of dangerous precedent, because its supporters haven't won anything that the community didn't already support: the activation of SegWit. The rest of the NYA is just chest thumping.

But the code is unnecessary. All they have to do is signal bit 1 of the version field in be block header and the nodes will activate SegWit.

Core developed and deployed SegWit which is a 2x capacity increase that is ready for activation right now. It is the miners who are holding up activation for completely irrational reasons.
 So in the end, it's the miners who have demonstrated that they want high fees, as indicated by their behavior.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:27:39
They did fix it - it's called SegWit. It provides a 2.1x capacity increase, solves transaction malleability, and makes advanced 2nd layer scaling practical. It's also deployed to over 90% of nodes, ready to go. 
It's the miners who are to blame for not signalling for its activation, despite the wishes of the community.

The hard fork part cannot be locked in. That's up to the community to decide, not the miners.
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:08:43
That's highly misleading. That figure accounts for Ripple, which is barely passable as a cryptocurrency (it doesn't even have a blockchain) and is accepted nowhere, and NEM - whatever that is, and dozens of other ridiculous altcoins and appcoins each worth hundreds of millions of dollars but with no hope of achieving market traction. Nobody who knows what they're talking about would say that those other coins represent true competition to Bitcoin.
The only real competitors to Bitcoin are Ethereum and Litecoin (Litecoin has a small amount of genuine market use, not just speculation, owing to its age).

@_date: 2017-06-18 20:26:23
We'll it looks like the NYA participants are going to activate SegWit by August using BIP91. Whether or not the community downloads the SegWit2x code to later activate the 2MB hard fork (which is extremely unlikely) isn't up to Core they would bear no responsibility either way.
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:15:59
You're probably not aware of the community battle that led to SegWit. It was the compromise between small blockers and big blockers. But surprise - the goalposts shifted, and then another compromise was demanded.

I'm still flabbergasted that evoorhees, of all people, is a cheerleader for a reckless push for big blocks. He's a big believer in decentralization and sound money, so I don't understand why he'd fail to understand the fundamental tradeoff in blockchains of decentralization vs capacity. Bitcoin cannot be sound money if it is not maximally decentralized. Capacity, at least at the base layer, must take a back seat to decentralization.
