If everyone is hodling no one will be able to buy to raise the price, since nobody is selling ��

It looks like bitcoin is gathering for another runup.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:12:51
How did you lose if you sold for a profit?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:45:10
Sure is. Heard he just bought a new Chevy Spark.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:54:39
Aaand the dip is over..
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:57:58
He lost his private keys. All he has left are like 20 dogecoins.

China is no longer a factor. In fact, bitcoin is doing great without it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:06:16
Yes, we know. It's old news and the price already crossed that bump in the road.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:38:50
"Chinese trading volumes now account for only around 5% – 10% of bitcoin’s or ethereum’s global trading volumes."
If those are the numbers than I don't see how they can significantly influence the price curve.

Can you imagine your grandma or mom trying to buy btc and than trying to figure out how many thousand satoshi's she needs to pay for that frozen yogurt?
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:30:42
Then you die
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:40:44
I have my doubts it will fall anywhere near those numbers. What is your basis for such prognosis?
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:18:09
I thought bitcoin was decentralized? It seems that the entire concept is hanging by a thread which is held by a group of miners in a land far, far away..
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:50:08
You have no idea with whom he has actually met and are therefore just spreading FUD. I suspect you sold your coins yesterday at around 3500 in anticipation btc would dip even lower, right?
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:47:07
Stop giving this man so much undeserved attention. There are many much more respectable critics of bitcoin that have actual valid pro and con arguments. This man is just a clown with an agenda to make money - buy low sell high.
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:12:57
It's likely they won't be banning mining from what I heard, just trading. But anything is possible with the Chinese, so yes, there is a risk buying now, imo. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:54:27
4 seconds.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:06:58
Who will accuse him?
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:16:15
What do you mean hypothetically? It's already happened/ing.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:03:16
Well that's fucking helpful: there's only a thousand dollar margin by which it can travel.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:29:02
Try bitstsmp. Fast verification, high limit
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:25:00
Why would they want to regulate their own manipulating?
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:12:11
All of the mines are already state owned. Steel, coal, copper, you name it, they control it..
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:04:52
Honest Question
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:07:36
I believe this Weekend, maybe even this Friday. After that it should go uphill.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:40:21
It'll be back up in no time. Just hang on. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:15:28
I wonder how you will determine the daily price of your goods and services due to btc volatility? Will there be daily fluctuations in your prices as well? Customers may not like that
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:14:22
Crypto is valuable as much as the next person is willing to pay for it.. just like his precious gold. The difference between the two is that crypto isn't mined by modern-day slaves in Africa and may actually possess real world value when any of the numerous cryptos currently in development start creating positive local and global changes.

This is old news from Tony Danza
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:39:03
We'll find out soon enough.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:18:11
Because they can't anonymously trade the liberty dollar like they can btc and make a fortune doing it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:01:34
*"Heavily critical of cryptocurrency exchanges, Xinhua said they had become a favourite among criminals across the world in an article today."*
So is the usd, but China isn't banning it.

I predict that the majority of your sales will come when btc reaches market highs. That will mean that the customer will most probably be timing his purchase so he doesnt buy when btc is down. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:49:10
Seems like heavy market manipulation to me.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:39:59
Where did you read this? Sounds plain retarded
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:22:11
Good riddance
