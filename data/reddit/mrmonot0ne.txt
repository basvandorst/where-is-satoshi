It all comes down to the scaling debate. Should we scale on chain or off chain? Which has essentially devolved into a Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash debate. Where Bitcoin developers have favored a 2nd layer solution while Bitcoin Cash developers have favored block size increase. No matter what people tell you both arguments have their merits. Also both sides have told their half truths. If you really want to understand it, it requires researching for hours. This is just one side of the story. Look for people who are on the other side of the argument.
If you want my personal opinion, the argument is essentially patience. OnChain people want immediate fixes, OffChain want a sustainible fix. (OnChain will argue that block size is sustainable IMO its not) You can debate which side is being unreasonable, there are arguments for both. Both sides have said half truths before. That being said I believe the current path core is going down is a smart and sustainable one. Unless some amazing breakthroughs happen Bitcoin will eventually need to increase its block size. I believe that this should be done algorithmically just like difficulty is adjusted for 10 minute block time. I think its naive to think it will never happen. Never say never or you end up on one of those complications of people who said it could not be done lol.
EDIT: I did not answer the specific claims like others did so I hope thats okay haha. I decided to provide more background so hopefully it would help understand why the person made these arguments. If you want specific answers others posts have that.
