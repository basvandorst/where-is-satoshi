How would they even get it into bitcoin?

Poooboy is making inferences about the future price of a bitcoin using [technical analysis.]( 
He is talking out of his ass. Past performance is not a guide to future performance.

The nascent nature of the Bitcoin currency renders what little value technical analysis has redundant. Right now the value of the currency will be susceptible to big news items that will cause the price to move up or down unpredictably. Your technical analysis cannot tell you that The Republic of Congo just made Bitcoin their official currency, or that Amazon has made Bitcoin their only accepted payment method. All you can do is go back to your charts after the fact and tell yourself you read the chart wrong.

So is there not an option to sell only at a given price? Or does the poor performance of MTGOX rule that option out too?

[A continuation pattern suggests that the (in this case, upward) pattern is set to continue after temporarily straying from said trend.]( [A bull flag is literally a shape made by the historical bitcoin price data, a believer will consider delineation from the bull flag shape a signal to buy or sell, depending on which way the prices goes. ]( suggested that the price will reach 220. [A breakout is when the price moves above or below a point it has previously remained at.]( Poooboy has then highlighted that his technical analysis has no value whatsoever by stating that he 'hopes it doesn't go down'. 
None of what I have just said matters because we are dealing with human behaviour here. Technical analysis cannot predict that.

This is not like a religious debate. There is no solid evidence as to which party is right or wrong in a religious debate. It is well accepted that technical analysis is unable to reliably forecast the future price of a stock or currency.

American bank accounts only. So difficult to buy here in the UK.
