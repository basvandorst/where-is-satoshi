there are people like him on the doge boards as well. they claim they dont care about price and thats only cuz they invested their $15 weekly allowance that their mom gave them for doing chores around the house. to people who invested 1000's, ask them if they care about price

lol. people are really this delusional? some dude thinks bitcoin will reach 6k this summer? it wont reach 6k EVER. it will die out just like myspace did and be replaced by something new, or crypto in general will die out. theres a reason its dropped 100's of dollars and will continue to do so. nobody is interested anymore. the fad is over. you people and your delusions of grandeur are hilarious. 6k by the summer? hahahah. id be willing to bet it wont even reach 1/10th of that by the summer.

i explained to you you fool, that even though they are finished, there might be 1 last spike or something. maybe from some imbeciles who want to buy low or something

1.) interesting point. and if no tax code is implemented, how do i go about filing in 2015? 
2.) would it matter if im off by a few dollars/cents? i said i made 180, but what if it was actually closer to 190 .. is that a big deal? what if i dont have all the exact numbers?

i did move on to something else that i believe in. also i knew somebody would say "weve been through the cycle before", just not this soon! lol 
in the late 2000's when block buster video was losing business, did the big wigs all say "relax, weve been through this cycle before" ...if they did, well... so do you see how silly that reasoning is? i think you guys are just trying to comfort yourselves by saying that but the truth is, you mightve been through the cycle before, but THIS time its different. unlike the last time, things have changed. cryptos have become bigger than they were back in 2011/2012. there are tons of alts and other coins that take bitcoins design and improve upon it.
its like when an electronic device comes out from 1 company, and they have a lock on the market. they think they are invincible but as time goes on, other competitors come out and improve upon the original product. eventually the original product is the one that gets left in the dust for something better. it becomes old and dies out and is replaced by something new and better. its happening right now in the automotive industry with cars like tesla/bmw. bmw and other luxury brands were long considered untouchable kings but other competitors like cadillac/tesla quite frankly blow them out of the water these days in terms of tech/power/etc.. if bmw views this as "a cycle theyve been through before, they will surely be making a huge mistake...this is the cycle of nature ..if you still think this is a "normal cycle and weve been here before" then i pray that you didnt invest TOO much money and are ok with your losses.

lol, as if there are "skills" in bitcoin. its a fucking gamble you clown. if they crash then they crash. in this case they crashed. if you let me borrow your magic 8 ball then maybe i could've seen the future, but since you didnt, then there was no way of knowing theyd crash. 
lemme guess, your one of those people who think gambling at a casino is all skill too right? winning at the slot machine is based on how you pull the lever, its all in the wrist..

lol so u lost 140k working at costco? where did u get the 140k to begin with? are you telling me you put a decades worth of your pay into these bullshit coins? i dont believe you. your wife is probably rich
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:46:00
im not pumping vtc and i even have my doubts about that coin as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:10:02
thanks very much! i most certainly held for LESS than a year, so as i understand, i would have to pay tax on that $180.  
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:57:32
thank you so much! very informative
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:35:33
i dont need to be reassured because i sold off all my btc a while back. i really dont care if it ever rises again, but im 100% convinced that it wont. things in general dont come back from the dead. i know ill get called a troll and called stupid/hated on but its just the truth. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:25:13
if you lost 140k what the fuck are you complaining about puss? youre probably already very rich and that was probably your dads pocket change anyway
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:59:40
no thanks. i just lost 14k. i would make the bet if i HAD the 5k, but i dont. my word will just have to do. as bitcoin drops to sub 300, you can think about that.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:07:57
and everything you just said is a different language to the majority of humans on the earth. its just a bunch of techno mumbo jumbo that nobody really knows about or cares to know about, aside from a few people on internet forums. you said to call you a sucker so i will, but i was one too. the difference is i stopped looking at the technical bullshit and started looking at it from the perspective of an average human being. when you view it from that perspective you will realize it is never going anywhere. 
but dont take my word for it. just look at the price from 12 months ago to now. good luck
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:53:03
lol. this isnt a cycle like previous ones. but ok. stay deluded
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:27:38
id wager 10 bitcoins, but the problem is theyre so fucking worthless that WHEN i win the bet, i wouldnt even be winning anything 
@_date: 2014-11-01 10:48:29
suckers in here will defend BTC saying stupid reasons like "because btc transaction speed is faster!!!" but as we continue to see, nobody in the real world gives a flying fuck about silly shit like that. no "regular" people are gonna ever go through the trouble of setting up a coinbase type of account, depositing money into it (which is risky), set up exchange accounts, download wallets, protect said wallets, backup their .dat files, etc. etc. 
by the time they could have done all this, they could have just paid in fucking cash. the tiny, tiny fee they will pay is not a big deal to most people, and the .932 seconds of waiting time they would save is also not enough to lure them in to crypto
if you are on the fence about investing, trust me, save your money. this technology is dead and people only want people like you to invest in hopes of creating a price rise so THEY can cash out. ill get labeled a troll for this but its true. people will dig up my post history, but its STILL gonna be true.  btc will never be adopted by the mainstream and most of us lost a lot of money on it. dont make the same mistake
your doubts and the points your bring up are very real
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:11:04
you fucking clowns still think this is FUD? u will never see a bitcoin above 500 dollars again. i wonder if youll be saying its jsut "fud" when bitcoins are worth less than 100 bucks
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:29:17
i would imagine this happens to very few people then? because im almost positive a large percentage of people involved in crypto have no idea about this stuff either
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:21:28
so opening a USD wallet would be like having another bank account? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:21:47
correct, i DO NOT have a good understanding of this stuff at all, including gains or losses. 
"hire a professional" 
so basically i have to spend more money to hire this professional, on top of the money i already lost? im paying money, just to report my losses, to make sure i dont lose MORE money? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:32:53
so youre saying i can use the money in my coinbase wallet to buy products on amazon? explain how that works. 
i really want to avoid the whole tax reporting process because i dont know much about it (especially since i didnt actually EARN anything, only lost money). it seems like a daunting process and id rather avoid it (unless of course i made profits), but i also want my remaining money back in my account where it is spendable on everyday goods/bills 
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:49:10
well i didnt, the money has been sitting in exchange sites and fluctuating up and down for about 2 years. so what happens now? what could/will happen?
@_date: 2015-11-08 05:05:06
i originally bought my BTC in late 2013/early 2014 and have since lost about 75% of my initial investment...since then ive been trading up and down fluctuating a grand or 2 here and there. i never withdrew my money though and have always kept it on exchange sites. ive never reported a single loss or gain yet. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:48:23
so withdrawing in small increments over the course of say months, wouldnt work?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:06:29
i dont really need to keep track of anything..i know exactly what ive lost compared to the amount of BTC ive bought off of coinbase. all i do is add up the purchase amounts and there is my final amount that was withdrawn from my bank account. 
when the day comes where i go to withdraw and the money i withdraw back into my account is LESS THAN the amount i TOOK OUT of my account to purchase, then why would i have any issues? 
also would it be better if i withdraw in small increments over the course of a few weeks? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:44:37
any1 else wanna chime in? 
i know at the end of the day nobody knows shit..but its still good to hear some opinions
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:43:33
heres an update:
coinbase sent me an email saying they flagged me for suspicious activity and to try again in a "few weeks" ...thats so unfair im not even gonna get into it. 
anyway im in the us. can anybody tell me what the next easier method of obtaining bitcoins are? im not really fond of the local seller idea so if there are any other websites like coin base please let me know 
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:23:28
can you tell me where exactly those buttons are on coinbase and btc-e? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:05:05
thank you sir! when i get the BTC into my btc-e account. how do i convert them to LTC at that point? and is it worth it (are there extravagant fees?)
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:10:18
reported issues? lol think ill stay away from them and use btc-e
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:20:55
which is better? cryptsy like gravyboat suggested? or btc-e? i already have a btc-e account so that would be more convenient...but if the process is more complicated or theres a higher fee then id go with another option. ..can any1 answer that?
