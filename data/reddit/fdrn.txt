It's a bit different: in LN, when your peer publishes an old state that gives them more money \(so less for you\) than the current state, you have a delay during which you can publish a penalty tx \(some people call it a "justice" tx\) that sweeps ALL the funds in the channel. But for this to work you have to monitor the blockchain and detect that your channel's funding tx has been spent, which is not very convenient on mobile phones that may be offline very often. Your option then would be to make that delay very long \(one week or more\) but that would mean that you could end up having to wait for a long time before you can get your money back if the peer you're connected to disappears and you have to publish your current state. Another option would be to delegate monitoring the blockchain and publishing the penalty tx to a third part \(a "watchtower"\).
If all you do is pay, you don't have to worry about that: each new state gives your peer more money than the old one, so it does make sense for them to publish an old state!
Also, terminal nodes \(and more generally nodes that don't relay payments\) don't have to be announced and added to other's nodes routing tables, so there could be a lot of mobile LN wallets that would have no impact on the size of the routing table.
But we have not given up on adding the option to receive payments on our mobile app, we just have not found a solution we're happy with yet.

It kind of defeats the point of having source routing in LN \(sender computes the route from its local routing table, and sends an onion\-wrapped message to the first node on the route, who sends it to the next node and so on...\).
Using a service to computes routes for you means you loose control over which nodes get selected, and how much you pay \(each node takes a small fee to relay payments\), unless you use your own routing servers.

Hi, eclair developper here.   
For the record, this wallet is based on eclair's codebase, with a major difference: routing is outsourced to an external server, while eclair's routing is done on the phone, and thus will always be a bit slower. The first payment can take a long time if you haven't started the app in a long time, we're aware of this and are working hard on making it faster. But then it's pretty fast, often less than 1s. Of course payments can take longer if nodes are not responding/reachable, and other routes have to be computed and tried.
"Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" is an independent project, and its author is not a partner/client/... of ACINQ \(and that's fine, eclair's code is open source\), but has made several valuable contributions to eclair.

No problem. I understand your point about UX and we are working on the "first payment is slow" problem, but after that in most cases payments should not be significantly slower than with other LN wallets \(and when they are it's mostly because of network issues\). We'd rather work on the specs and our libraries to improve routing issues on mobile apps but I can see why Anton chose to delegate routing to an external service for his wallet.
I just did not care much for the "this new app is so much better than eclair" undertone that I felt was present \(I guess it's subjective\) and wanted to set the record straight and explain clearly that it is based on our work \(maybe you didn't know that ?\).

Yes that's it, I've added the github link to the description on Youtube. Thanks!

It's not, and it's still a bit too early to describe implementations as "mature" anyway. There are many things that we need to add, and the protocol is not finalized, but we wanted to show that it is already advanced enough to build a demo that illustrates what LN might look like.

Yes we're both coming to Milan and are looking forward to it!

Which version of eclair-wallet are you using ? If you're using 0.3.0 install [version 0.3.1]( transfer your funds to the new app and when it's done delete version 0.3.0.  You can contact us on our [gitter]( if you need any help. Thanks!

Yes, our setup was much simpler with every node directly connected to the same bitcoind on regtest. We did not demonstrate realistic payments but wanted to focus on interoperability. Obviously, our test was only possible because of the hard work of Rusty and Christian on the binary protocol :-)
