Yes, that is more precise. I suppose I could say that: one is very likely to be able to be sold for a similar amount the next day, and one is immediately worthless to anyone but yourself. That's where the "purchasing" difference is made, in my mind.

Purchasing an investment is different from purchasing food... one gains value and can be sold easily, and the other turns into poop.

it's not *that* much of a rush. The price goes up and down but it's not going to the moon tomorrow.

Sure, works for me

Anyone care to calculate what the generation of those vanity addresses cost?
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:19
Ah, that makes sense.

Create a closed network of mining nodes that only you have access to, then mine a couple weeks of blocks and keep the rewards. After that, open the network to other people.

right, yeah, these numbers, without some measure of at least standard deviation or ideally a p-value, are fairly useless.

GDAX added the fee for you
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:35:15
Thank you for the explanation. I had in mind the inverse, that it primarily depended on output count, which isn't right.

gotta have taxes to pay for public services (roads, schools, clean air, a court system), and we all deserve fair reimbursement for those times we paid for what of it you used. It's society, thanks for participating.

The USD side of it is by the FDIC. Edit: And they have insurance on the crypto. Now, if they got (massively, offline wallet) hacked and someone stole the bitcoin, there would be no way to get that back if the market doesn't want to sell it all back.

hey, some blocks have been including very low fee (zero?) transactions recently, now that the spamming has stopped
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:43:27
Offline just means it's a stack of paper in some safes, which is fine except that there are non-internet ways to get in there. And a multi signature vault won't do anything to stop someone from walking away with the paper copies.

Right, yeah, I was incorrect, and if the online wallets, with a small amount of BTC, were stolen, the insurance would pay out fiat to buy back BTC.
I suppose I'm being more broadly paranoid that if the offline wallets were breached and large amounts transferred, they wouldn't be able to magically get that BTC back, there may not be enough liquid BTC on the market to get it all back, if holders were to jack up the price.

No argument there.

GDAX is free withdrawals, and I believe should work

Edit: see below. 
send to the same address each time and then you can spend from just that address in a short transaction

This is the simplest and safest method for HODLers. Make a single bitcoin address, print a few copies, stash them safely, send the coins to the public key, then sit out the next few months. Once it settles down you can reload into a wallet like a trezor or coinbase.
