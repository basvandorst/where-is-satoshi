Doesn't mean anything unless the fbi confirmed it
@_date: 2016-04-04 02:07:26
AMAZING journalism!!
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:01:58
Super late to the game with this
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:02:18
Reclaim? Reclaim what? Bitcoin is the foundation and standard for all crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:06:50
That doesn't mean there's 20 trillion USD invested.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:00:57
Even if Lightning isn't as good, it won't matter. Hardly anyone uses railblocks or vertcoin compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:33:58
Oh man that is cringe. You can't get that emotional on live TV, come on man.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:50:25
Nice job, keep up the good work.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:08:58
Yea, okay. GTFO
@_date: 2019-07-03 11:42:13
Yes. I recommend watching it. It's seriously comical. I mean he sort of has a point about Bitmex capitalizing on serial gamblers...but that's on the individual, not BitMex. That would be like bashing casinos because some idiots go bankrupt. Bitmex is just providing a platform and service...what people choose to do with it is their own prerogative.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:06:18
I started buying after Gox and I have to say that it fell wayyy riskier back then than it does now. Just wish I could go back in time and put more of my disposable income into it lmao. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. I remember DCA'ing and thinking "well, this is money that I could *definitely*, potentially lose. 
Of course it's still good to assume these days that an investment in BTC is money that could potentially be gone...but back then it *actually* felt like the money I was investing wasn't going to be around in a year or two.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:49:00
Now this is truly *unbelievable.* Seriously. Take a step back for a second. The year is 2014, just five years ago. Mt. Gox bubble has burst. Bitcoin price is approx. $600. Holders are still not even sure if Bitcoin is going to survive or not, let alone recover in price. 
Now imagine a time traveler comes from the year 2019. He shows you this screenshot. 
How fucking mind blown would you be!?!?
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:34:47
When will that be released?

 [Nouriel Roubini speaking about Bitcoin/crypto at the Asia Blockchain Summit yesterday.](
I mean I always knew this guy hated Bitcoin, but man...he like, *really* hates Bitcoin (and crypto in general).
My favorite quote:


Then, the interviewer plays a segment of what BitMex's Arthur Hayes said earlier about Roubini:


Then, they go back to Roubini. His response:


Roubini looks PISSED. God this is absolutely hilarious. These two are supposed to debate today. Lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:27:21
No risk? Lol, you don't understand futures. There's a ton of risk.
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:19:49
If you’re a holder, you would be a *fool* to sell at any point over the next 3-5 years. No way in hell I am selling in that time period. Lots of new money is coming in. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:34:32
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:36:19
This is amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:13:57
No way in hell I'd trust that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:47
This is nothing short of amazing. Just, wow. This guy totally deserves it. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:12:30
Has anyone done margin funding before? Can you recommend a good service to do this? I came across Cryptolend and Whalelend. Or is it better to do margin funding directly through Bitfinex? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:59:26
Who are these people dumb enough to actually buy some random crypto after seeing an ad on Google? Teenagers? Senile old people? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:57:33
Saw this too. He did not say it was “spreading fast” though, and in my opinion he painted it in a more neutral light. It was more like a “people don’t trust the federal reserve with their money, so they’re resorting to Bitcoin, which isn’t even controlled by anyone!” He said it in a more “can you believe people are doing this?”, shocking/surprise kind of way.
Overall though I’d say it’s good for Bitcoin. He didn’t bash it, had his facts straight, and explained *why* people are going to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:59:38
Yes, just be patient.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:35:50
Sooo hardware is closed source...does that make it unsafe?
@_date: 2018-09-24 17:16:32
There’s no way of proving that 
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:30:08
Derivatives. Move along
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:08:30
Lots of fudders out today 
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:23:58
Couldn’t be more wrong, what a stupid article. Satoshi’s inspiration goes back way before Lehman Brothers. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:39:44
Again, that is short term $$. Emergency funds are longer term, yes. My point is that fiat is NOT an investment!
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:59:13
Lol you should read all the Bitcoin "obituaries"
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:17:43
Zero computer background. He's not a programmer and shouldn't be talking about this stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:52:49
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:28:21
Lol what? No. I don’t know anyone that holds fiat (rich or poor). Maybe short term, yea. But not long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:23
Lol do people actually believe this story??
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:20:51
Huh? Chart is completely wrong. It’s missing gold, the longest lasting reserve currency ever! Who makes this crap??
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:34:56
That’s why I loaded up on ZRX. Coinbase is building their DEX on 0x.
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:18:42
But muh instant Nano
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:55
I second this
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:08:12
Meh, PayPal is a private company, they can do whatever they want. It’s still legal for Alex Jones to spout his garbage though. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:21:30
Oh god what a stupid ass post...
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:21
Nick Szabo is a computer genius and arguably Satoshi. Roger Ver is a snake oil salesman. 
How anyone can take Roger Ver's word over Szabo's is just beyond me. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:46:06
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:22:05
Yep. The next run is going to make the last one look like a tiny blip on the radar.
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:13:32
Future usage, yes. Store of value/investment? Hell no.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:19:02
Rip off!
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:17:28
@_date: 2018-09-25 23:56:09
totally agree. Seems like common sense to me, but common sense apparently isn't very common.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:58:41
Speculation aside, anyone else here using BTC as long term savings/store of value? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:18:56
This guy doesn't have any technical background, he's literally just a salesman for a scam coin. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 03:02:05
No, they don’t. What’s your point, bro?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:15:22
lol this is hilarious 
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:02:16
Most widely accepted crypto **by far**, nearly free and instant transactions. 
Btw, dump those Ripple bags. You got duped. There's a reason why Coinbase is not listing XRP. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 02:05:16
Agreed. It’s ridiculous.
At the same time, this company is based out of the Marshall Islands, which has “free association” with the US. Not really sure if that matters or not, but it may. I’m not too sure what it means for jurisdiction.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:52:07
What's $6 trillion in today's dollars though?
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:12:59
My realistic time horizon is 10-15 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:04
Numerous people who predicted current prices were heavily invested in Bitcoin. Just because someone is invested doesn't mean that their prediction is worthless.
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:18:24
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:04:21
Ok. Correction: no one with half a brain holds fiat. Fiat is not an investment. Duh?
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:49:52
Augur is going to do it best imo
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:16:01
No. Because no one intentionally holds fiat. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:31:34
We win.

Anything over $1,000 would make me very happy.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:08:38
ELI5? What is this?
@_date: 2018-09-24 20:17:16
Umm, no. Like I said, there's no way of proving it. One person could have hundreds of addresses with coins spread out. Another address could have the coins of hundreds of different people. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:14:40
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:28:37
Right? Pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-06-06 04:38:05
This is all FUD. I have friends in Greece and this is just simply not true.

Then I guess you haven't learned much!
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:16:10
Wow. The media is fucking retarded. They're like little kids when it comes to understanding things.
1. BITCOIN BAD. BITCOIN VERY BAD.
2. WHAT IS BITCOIN? DURR
3. BITCOIN BAD. WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN? DURR.
4. BITCOIN SHADY. BLOCKCHAIN GOOD.
5. BITCOIN OK. BLOCKCHAIN REALLY GOOD.
Fucking idiots. That bimbo writer from the Financial Times is also clueless. "Blockchain as a technology is not very tried and tested." DURR. 
The media talks about "blockchain" (what happened to "THE"?) like it's something totally separate from Bitcoin. They think it's just some new technology that they can use without having to get involved with any sort of currency or bitcoin. 
NEWSFLASH: There is only **ONE** legitimate, tried and tested blockchain: BITCOIN. 
The lack of understanding, and the amount of utter fools that somehow find their way to the limelight, talking like they know something about this, is pathetic. Fucking idiots.
@_date: 2015-06-06 04:38:43

@_date: 2018-08-30 17:21:47
This guy gets it! Belfort doesn't know jack shit about crypto, CNBC should not be having him on the show...but then again, it's CNBC, so can't really expect much from them. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:10:17
So? Anyone who has done their homework knows that Bitcoin is better than gold in almost every way. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:35:10
Lol idk why but I am literally laughing my ass off. Hahahahahah. Ah man. Good shit OP, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:18:12
Right? Dash is a complete scamcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-08 13:50:02
Soo as someone who bought bitcoins a year ago and currently has them in cold storage, what exactly would I have to do once the hard fork happens? I'm a bit confused. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:00:51
How many times does this have to happen until people learned? That BTC is *long* gone man. There’s no way to get t back. 
ZIf you have that much money in BTC, you should’ve known better to secure it. Really no excuse. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:51:31
Lmao what??
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:10:22
You don’t know that. It is certainly possible within the next 10 years that a country might.
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:47:13
I’d say it’s more popular because it’s decentralized and has a hard cap on supply. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:32:02
TL; DR?
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:22:20
It will most likely be higher than what it is today. I'd say around 2-3k.
@_date: 2018-05-19 01:12:24
Bingo. Price still needs time to level out. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:51:24
Well they just lost a lot of business
@_date: 2018-05-10 00:07:28
Lmao I know what’s in the genesis block..been here longer than you. Sounds like you’re living in your own world though hahah. Good luck, you’ll need it 
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:07:04
"World's most secure and easy to use bitcoin wallet"
How many times have we heard this?
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:03:16
Huh? Your comment makes literally no sense. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:14:33
It’s because we’re still in a bear market. Were you here late last year? People were losing their shit! 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:46:09
Lol dude, you’re talking like one of those conspiracy theory nuts. The government is not going super anti-Bitcoin. They’re actually embracing the tech. You believe whatever you want though hahaha
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:00:22
Good. This guy is a blatant scammer. Eventually it's all going to come crashing down on him. Just give it time. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:41:38

Thank you for these. I have a question about your comment regarding the first quote: what exactly could be considered a storage of wealth then? Things that give us survival value? Water? Food? 
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:49:01
Lol this is so bogus
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:55:38
Lol you have no clue what you're talking about
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:55:58
Based on the fact that the Winklevii totally bombed and there was no mention at all of the ETF...
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:45:56
I'll believe this when I see it. And why the HELL is Maxcoin on there?! 
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:43:05
Buy half now, wait and see what happens to the price after.

Problem resolved. I did a system restore and was able to get the Google Authenticator back. Phew!
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:33:08
GOOD. Screw the Bitcoin Foundation and their bankster friends. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 02:06:23
Wow. I have a feeling that 2015 is going to be a BIG year!
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:11:28
Kaku is a complete nut? The man is practically a genius. He built a particle accelerator in high school...
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:11:03
He's right. People seem to forget that Bitcoin relies entirely on the mining of a small amount of massive data mining centers...all central points of failure...
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:11:35
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:01:59
The next year is going to be make or break for Bitcoin. If we see similar NYDFS regulations coming out, Bitcoin is doomed. These regulations make it extremely frustrating for merchants and consumers to deal with Bitcoin- if we see more regulations like this, Bitcoin won't come anywhere near mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:51:00

Super dumb question, but i still don't know how to actually send and receive bitcoin tips on reddit. can anyone instruct my feeble mind on this?
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:15:06
Bitcoin is NOT ready for mainstream adoption anytime soon. 99% of people still have no clue what it even is!
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:51:35
I agree. It would not be a pretty situation. We're talking people's savings, retirements, etc. all losing massive amounts of value. 
At the same time though, I have a feeling that the collapse of the dollar is inevitable...the current system we have in place now is simply not sustainable, and will only continue to lose value.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:32:12
Looks like a great product. Too bad it's way beyond 99% of the population's price range
@_date: 2014-11-19 03:39:43
I also think we need it a button for it on Reddit. Typing out is annoying. Would be 10x easier if they just put a button next to the "reply" button.
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:08:12
Wow. Spot on.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:42:32
Many bots on here. Number of subscribers is irrelevant.

"Bitcoin will represent only a few percent of the crypto market cap within 18 months."
@_date: 2014-11-04 08:15:54
Not good for BTC
@_date: 2018-05-19 01:14:33
Perfectly said. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:23:32
I think above all, we need to inspire younger generations to take a serious look at blockchain technology. Kids in middle school, high school, and at university. They are our future!
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:36:37
I disagree. I think he makes some legitimate points. Bitcoin is still a vulnerable technology that needs a LOT of work before it's ready to go fully mainstream. We need as many coders working on this thing as possible.
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:49:36
Agreed. Doesn't matter if there's a ton of ATMs- if nobody has a clue what Bitcoin is or doesn't care, then so what...
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:53:29
1. Fiat currencies are losing value and will only continue to do so (inflation). 
2. I don't trust the banks/government with my money. 
3. I want to be my own bank and be fully in control of my own funds. 
4. Bitcoin has the potential to raise millions out of poverty in the developing world. I want to be part of that change. 
5. It's cool.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:09:26
Okay, is there a way for me to wipe my operating system and install a new one? I'm guessing I'll have to put any important files on a usb drive if I do this?
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:58:01
This is great news!! Keep it up!
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:54:05
Anyone care to summarize for me?
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:12:43
Couldn't agree more. I'm getting very bad feelings about Circle and Allaire. Allaire seems like some typical banker douche that wants to take as much of our money as possible.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:12:49
Really hope that voice isn't over the entire video. Way too monotone
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:25:37
I don't get how people can listen to Max Keiser. His voice is so annoying and he's a total nutjob!
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:00:00
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:02:34
I wouldn't say terrible, but it definitely could have been a bit better. He sounded a little too evangelical and repeated the same thing over and over. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:44:04
This guy is a tool. What an idiot.
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:33:05
Wow! This is a great talk. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:01:37
Paypal is going to be replaced, no doubt about it. If not by Bitcoin then by some other crypto.
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:38:57
Is it still possible for Bitcoin to go mainstream despite having clear disadvantages compared to PoS algorithms? Many are saying PoW is simply not sustainable in the long run- I believe Gavin actually agreed with this as well. 
Is it even possible for Bitcoin to change to some sort of PoS or different algo?
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:12:55
...umm Ethereum definitely doesn't use PoW...
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:34:03
Pathetic. You received 30 fucking million dollars and this is what happens? No excuses. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:35:12
I feel like Coindesk is really spinning this one...all the links to their "sources" are back to their own website.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:15:23
And this is why I am in Bitcoin for the long term. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:45:35
This is decent news. If they revised the DFS' regulations to something more open/acceptable towards Bitcoin, I think it would be HUGE
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:51:45
Changetip isn't going to have a big impact on price imo until it integrates with Facebook.
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:36:58
This isn't that good. Alex Jones is a total idiot, we don't want Bitcoin associated with him.
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:01:15
Yep, I have to agree here. Wall St. is also competing with **BIG** money in other countries now. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:34:34
When is Bitcoin actually going to be good for remittance? At this point, it's not much better than going through a bank. Reasons:
1. Exchanges marking up the price of bitcoins in order to stay afloat.
2. Service fees when you sell your Bitcoins (ex: Coinbase has a fee of 2.9%. To remit $1500, that would cost me over 40 bucks). 
3. Exchanges (at least the ones here in Korea) don't actually let you buy bitcoins directly through them. You have to go into your online banking, transfer money to the bank that works with the exchange, and THEN the bitcoins show up in your account with the exchange. More fees ensue. It's just ridiculous. 
Everyone keeps talking about how great bitcoin is for remittance- yea sure maybe if you live in the developing world and you're getting crushed with massive transfer fees. But as for people in the developed world, it's not worth the hassle. Much safer, more convenient, and roughly the same price to just to through a bank. 
Plus, what's to stop banks from just lowering their remittance fees in order to compete with Bitcoin? Doesn't seem like a huge issue.

What is the deal with confirmation times? Bitcoin can never succeed if it takes up to an hour for a transaction to be confirmed! The fastest confirmed transactions are usually around 10 minutes, correct? Even that is WAY too long. How will this issue be resolved??

I wouldn't be the least surprised if it was over $1,000 USD by the end of three months. There's been many companies coming forward lately saying they will begin to incorporate Bitcoin, and that trend is only going to increase. Once Ebay and Paypal announce their acceptance of BTC that will definitely drive the price up.

SMH. You're making Bitcoin sound like some ponzi cult. If the price is going to increase, it's highly unlikely it will increase at the rate it did in the past. If anything, I'm guessing it'll be a slow increase- IF it even increases at all.

So what makes you better than Korbit or Coinplug? I currently use Korbit for remittance to USD. It's okay- it's a little annoying though because every time I buy btc through them with my krw, I have to log onto my Korean online banking and *then* transfer krw to Korbit's bank account. *Then* the coins appear in my account on Korbit. 
It's a bit of a hassle tbh. Too many hoops to jump through for remittance. Most people I know would rather pay the slightly higher fee of remitting through a Korean bank because of convenience. There's a *huge* market for people in Korea that want to remit money home (think of all the English teachers)
Still waiting for the "Coinbase" of Korea, where I can simply link up a bank account and buy directly through your website. Also, if you were able to support USD or any fiat currency withdrawal, that would be a **huge** game changer for your company.

Bitaddress.org is good because it's open source and has been checked by fellow Bitcoiners. Here's what you should do:
1. Go to bitaddress.org and download the Github file. Should bring you to another page and if you go down to the bottom right there should be a zip file you can download. Download it, and put it on a flash drive. 
2. Restart computer and TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET! Your computer cannot be connected to the web when doing this. 
3. Put in flash drive, click the .html file, which should bring you to the website. When it has generated an address, check BIP38 and then put in **a very long and complex alpha-numeric password.** Click generate, and then print out the result.

Okay- the issue with that though is that one of the main reasons why the market cap isn't that high in the first place is because of the volatility! We need things to stabilize first (somehow) and then we'll start gaining more market cap. I can't see it happening the other way around.

Korbit isn't that convenient in my opinion. Why? Because you have to freakin transfer money from your Korean bank account to Korbit's Korean bank account, and THEN the Bitcoin's are added to your account on the website.
It's pretty inconvenient. I recommend using Coinplug instead, which lets you link your bank account to the website and buy Bitcoin directly, instead of having to send it to freakin' Woori bank like with Korbit.

I think as a community we really need to focus on using the term "bits" and getting everything priced in bits.

I'm using it as a hypothetical example. Ex: You walk into a coffee store one day and want to pay with Bitcoin. The person behind the counter tells you how much it costs. It's way more convenient to speak in terms of bits as opposed to speaking in terms of weird decimals in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:28:03
I honestly can't give specific examples. And I'm not a techie. I just distinctly remember reading an article where Gavin had agreed (possibly with Vitalik?) that eventually Bitcoin would have to change from PoW. 
And Vitalik has written extensively about the long term issues with PoW. I kinda trust his word because the guy is brilliant.

@_date: 2014-12-02 13:34:16


Do you have any clue how much that would cost? Look at Bitcoin. It has had years of "marketing" through millions upon millions of VC investment dollars, news reports, government recognition, merchant/consumer adoption, etc- all of which have led to a **massive** network effect that no other crypto can come anywhere close to touching- and yet *despite* all this mass amount of marketing/network effects- most of the world (including Argentina) is still totally and completely oblivious to what Bitcoin is (that's assuming if they've even heard of it in the first place- which is also very unlikely). 
Do you really think some marketing campaign from a tiny crypto with a mere 50 million dollar market cap is going to have such a huge effect that in *3 months*, everyone will know about it??? That is **EXTREMELY** unlikely. For something like that to happen, you would need a truly revolutionary crypto- something that is as revolutionary as Bitcoin was. And to be honest, Bitshares simply isn't revolutionary enough to accomplish that. Sure, bitUSD is a good concept. Sure, it sounds nice. But ya know what? Market-pegged assets are not that difficult to achieve. NuBits already has it, Ethereum can easily implement it, and I'm sure Bitcoin could find a way to incorporate it as well (we're already seeing people tackle the volatility issue with things such as BitReserve). 
The only crypto that at this point has any chance of doing something as revolutionary as Bitcoin is Ethereum- simply because Vitalik is a freakin' genius and because they have a truly amazing team and backing of supporters. Their "guns" are simply MUCH bigger than that of Bitshares'. 
Best of luck, and don't put all your eggs in one basket.

"The dollar has lost 97 percent of its value. The end stages of a paper currency always goes very rapidly.

This is good news, but we're going to need more merchant adoption in the form of the 1-800-FLOWERS announcement. Of course customers at Newegg are going to be using bitcoin- Newegg is a computer/hardware retailer.
Merchant adoption is kind of pointless if the consumers are not even close to adoption yet. We need bitcoin to be "dumbed down and idiot proof" for the average Joe first.

Why not go with something different rather than doge and litecoin? I know they have better network effects than other alt coins, but I think it would be cool to separate yourselves from other companies by going with a *real* alt coin. 
FYI: I would reconsider Doge. It's been on a slow decline for a while and has numerous current issues. Source:

There are literally hundreds of millions of dollars going into Bitcoin related projects, companies, and services. Bitcoin is constantly being worked on and improved by many people, as is all the other alt coins (except WAY more people are working on Bitcoin). 
Bitcoin's network effect is growing rapidly- it's market cap is almost 8 BILLION dollars. Litecoin is the largest alt coin behind it, and its market cap is not even $300 million. Dogecoin is not even at 30 million. The "competition" doesn't come close. Source:

I use Korbit. Very easy. Once your Korean bank account is set up, you'll need to set up online banking. Once you do that, in order to buy Bitcoins off Korbit, you have to transfer money from your onlin bank account to Korbit's bank account, and then about a minute later they show up in your account. A bit different than Coinbase, but still very easy.

From my understand, the miners need to have enough incentive to continue mining (aka, they have to make profit). Today, most Bitcoin mining is done by the huge, centralized data centers. If those places (companies?) find that it's no longer profitable to mine...well then I think the whole network would collapse. Mining supports/secures the network, does it not?
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:26:18
Good news. Happy to see that Bitcoin is slowly expanding in lesser-developed countries- imo these are the places that will *really* see a huge benefit with this new technology. 1,000 by the end of the year is a tough goal, but I'm happy these guys are setting the bar high for themselves.

This. I don't think Bitcoin is viable as a currency simply because it will take so long for it to become stable, and by then, another technology can easily come along and do a much better job as a stable currency (shameless plug in: bitUSD from Bitshares). 
On the other hand, I do believe Bitcoin will be the "foundation" for which other currencies can be valued. Any new currency that pops up would be foolish to not allow it to be bought with Bitcoin.

Yea that's assuming Bitcoin becomes adopted as a worldwide day to day currency- even IF that happens, we are many years away from that. We'll have to wait for the "loop" to fully close, if it ever does. And it's not just buying things in local currency, it's also being able to pay taxes and interact with the government with that currency. I don't see that happening any time soon in most countries.

Meh. That's a weak argument. 
We are a **LONG** ways off from being paid in Bitcoin, paying taxes in Bitcoin, paying off loans in Bitcoin, paying for groceries in Bitcoin, etc. And that's just the USA, a place that's considered the "leader" in Bitcoin. For the "loop" to be fully closed Bitcoin would have to be used in day-to-day life in countries like the USA **and** South Korea. You would be delusional to think that we'll get to that point any time soon.  
I'm sure someone will come here and say "Oh! Bitwage has already started it in the USA!". Bitwage has barely done anything at this point, just look at their "customers". People in Korea don't even know what Bitcoin is...

The coins I have in savings (currently in cold storage) were bought from Coinbase. I can pretty much 100% assume that these coins are linked to my real identity. 
What sorts of issues does this create if Bitcoin gains a lot of value in the future? Will the IRS actually come after me for not paying capital gains tax? Would it be wise to move these coins out of cold storage, through some coin-mixing service (I have NO CLUE how that works), and then back into cold-storage in order to increase anonymity?
Is there any possible way I can "swap" these coins for more "anonymous" coins?
I would prefer to not have to worry about the IRS and US government, and I would prefer that they DO NOT know that I have coins.

@_date: 2017-01-30 08:22:48
Completely wrong on so may levels...taking away any amount of infrastructure doesn't matter at all. Bitcoin is definitely not unpopular in undeveloped countries...look at India and countries in Southeast Asia for example. 
Dollar bills and gold are DURABLE?! Really? Totally false again, for a variety of reasons that are so common sense that I don't even have to go into. Bitcoin isn't widely accepted yet because it's still quite new and is still going through the "storage of value phase". Even then...Bitcoin doesn't need to be something that has to be accepted everywhere in order to have value. Being used as a currency is just one simple aspect of Bitcoin. It provide value in other ways. Again, I'm not going to go into it because it seems like you're either new to this stuff or haven't learned enough.

What? Totally incorrect. How are you going to just "take away" all the power? "Take away" all the computers? They're distributed all around the world!
For example, even if a country (let's say, China) was to SOMEHOW shut down all of the computers and power contributing to the Bitcoin network...Bitcoin would still survive NO PROBLEM. Mining would just move elsewhere.

@_date: 2018-06-02 16:44:28
Lol dude any early investors like Novogratz or Galaxy Digital have already made a *ton* of money off the fools who bought into EOS. They don’t care if it succeeds or not- they care only about the money. They’ve made soo thus far. So if you think EOS will succeed because of that...very foolish. 
ETH has all the developer mindshare and a *huge* first mover advantage. There’s simply no comparison. One is the largest blockchain platform in the world, with most of the top 100 coins built on it...the other has collected billions of dollars in a year long “ico” with nothing to show for it, no projects, nothing. Oh and severe bugs wouldn’t even let them release mainnet on time. 
EOS has already failed hard, very hard. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:41:03
Yes, but think about the potential long-term upside if you're willing to hold for 5-10 years or even more. The market is short term bearish for now, but most people (including "big money") are all very bullish long term. If we see a $100k Bitcoin some day (assuming an increased supply at that point to 18 million total mined coins) that would give us a nearly $1.8 trillion market cap. I think the next one or two bubbles could probably get us there. So with those assumptions in mind, buying around these prices is very much near "the bottom".
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:55:01
This would be absolutely huge if it happened. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:52:47
$82 billion per year is only needed to “sustain” the price assuming that miners sell all of their block rewards to usd, which they certainly won’t do. If miners don’t sell the entire reward, it won’t require that much money to sustain 250k per coin. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:08:43

Because back then, Bitcoin was in free-fall. You never buy when things are in free-fall. Never try to catch the falling knife. This is now the **third time** Bitcoin has bottomed out around these levels.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:19:20
Just a matter of time until Bitcoin and crypto ETFs start popping up all over the place- third party, insured custody options will make this a reality. Recent regulatory clarification about BTC/ETH not being securities has certainly helped. I looked at the link that OP mentioned in their comment- although not directly related to Bitcoin/crypto, it certainly seems like the SEC wants to relax regulations a bit.

@_date: 2018-06-17 23:29:05
I highly doubt **anyone** believed we would hit $20,000 by end of 2017. So when I hear today that Bitcoin could be worth $250,000 at some point, part of actually wouldn’t be surprised. 
For this year, I don’t think 2018 will be anything special. The market still needs time to stabilize from the 2017 bubble. I can see a $100,000 Bitcoin by end of 2019 or some time in 2020 though.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:46:44
Okay, idk why you’re comparing this to the US dollar. That is completely different from what we’re talking about. The US dollar is a currency, not an asset. I hope that’s what you’re saying, because the way you’re explaining it is confusing. 
Bitcoin is *both* and currency (can be used globally to pay for things and is widely accepted) *and* a digital asset (can be used as an investment/store of value). I think we can both agree on that. So yes, when he says Bitcoin is *only* a currency, that is incorrect.
When he says tokens/digital assets though, he’s referring to the multitudes of tokens and assets built on platform coins such as Ethereum. Those are definitely not currencies.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:17:11
Miners don’t have a break even point, how many times do we have to go over this??
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:55:08


1. Where are you getting this "90%" number from? I doubt you can provide any evidence to back that up.
2. There is no  use case of Bitcoin because Bitcoin has *numerous* use cases, with each use case being of different value depending on the user. For some people, Bitcoin's store of value is its  use case. For others, trading against alts is its  use case. For others, a hedge against fiat. It all depends, so just lumping Bitcoin into one singular use case is very narrow-minded. 
3. Where is your crystal ball that says ICOs being labeled as securities= Bitcoin crash? For all we know, those people may sell their alts and jump back into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-07 15:15:29


Huh? This makes literally zero sense. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:01:28
I haven't been here since the top in 2013. I actually heard about the crash afterwards, and started doing research into Bitcoin early 2014. I'll admit, I was **very skeptical** at first. Nonetheless, I decided to start dollar cost averaging small amounts by spring 2014. Sentiment at that time was **very** low, and quite similar to the sentiment I'm seeing now. People saying Bitcoin saying was a ponzi scheme, it didn't work, "the company" will go bankrupt, it's not secure, etc. I've heard and read it all. They all had one thing in common: a poor understanding of how Bitcoin actually works. None of those critics took any time to read the whitepaper or do any kind of research into the technology. On top of that, bear markets bring "irrational despair" just as much as bull markets bring "irrational exuberance".
If there is one thing for certain, crypto is not going away. It's a genie that has been let out of the bottle. If you're a long term holder like myself, sentiment cycles do not phase you. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:30:55
Miners will sell whenever they want to sell, what's so hard to understand about that? Even if some are in "the red" that doesn't mean they will fold immediately- especially if they feel the price will recover in the future. 
More importantly though, the "break-even" point is **completely** different for every miner depending on the cost of their electricity and is **extremely** hard to estimate. Think of all the costs that go into a mining operation: cooling costs, electricity costs, hardware costs, rent costs, etc. These will be completely different for every company- and even then, some countries have extremely cheap electricity while for others it's more expensive. For some companies their "break-even" is $10k. For others, maybe $5k or $3k. We just don't know, and it's not like companies are going out there revealing their costs to the competitors. **There is no universal "break-even" point** **because it cannot be accurately estimated.**

I predominantly hold BTC. Hold some ETH too. ETH is most definitely *not* a shitcoin. I mean, the majority of the top 100 coins are literally built on top of it. There is a ton of development going on, and ETH has all of the developer mindshare. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:35:04

Dumped all of my BCH at the fork. In hindsight it was a great decision. BCH ratio back then was nearly **.2**...today it is approx. **.03.**...depending on where you draw the numbers that's an approximate **650-700% decrease in BTC value.** Pretty clear to me what the market has decided. 
If you're looking at USD value, BCH is down over 40% from the fork. Not looking good at all. I really don't understand how people like can shill this shitfork, which was originally shilled *heavily* by guess who... **Roger Ver** and **Craig Wright.** No further explanation needed there. I ran FAR away as soon as I knew they were involved. BCH literally has a fraction of the security, developers, usage, and adoption compared to Bitcoin. No comparison whatsoever. It's going to be a long and steady bleed down through the rankings.
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:17:44

I love Bitcoin just as much as the next guy here, but people seriously underestimate the staying power of gold. It is *the best* store of value in history- as it has a track record of literally thousands of years. Bitcoins track record is just nearing *10* years (still a big accomplishment imo). 
Do I believe Bitcoin is a *better* store of value? Yes. But that does not mean it will “dominate” gold- whatever that means. I can see Bitcoin market cap overtaking the total market cap of gold (~$7 trillion) some day, but doing it within 3-5 years? That’s insane growth from where we are now.

Bitcoin was not marketed or advertised like BCH was in the beginning though. Ver and Wright ran a huge PR campaign. When Bitcoin was first launched, hardly anyone knew of it haha. People simply bought it on their own..they assigned their own value to it, rather than being advertised (tricked) into it like what Ver and Wright did with BCH.
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:06:26
Spot on right here. Ver is a classic snake oil salesman...why do people think he teamed up with Craig Wright in the first place? I'll give him credit though, he sucked a lot of fools in when they forked from Bitcoin. Funny how Ver goes on about the blocksize, transactions, scalability or whatever...It was never about any of that. 
The fork to Bitcoin Cash was about creating money essentially out of thin air by convincing people it had any value in the first place...now the holders (or what's left of them) are left with the remains and pretty salty about it.

@_date: 2018-11-23 15:49:06
You're missing my point. For some people, bitcoin is a currency. They use it to buy things or transact. For others its an investment, they hold onto it. For others (like myself) it is **both**. I intend on holding Bitcoin long term, yes. At some point though, I'm going to spend it. In bull markets, bitcoin tends to act more as a currency, because the value is high and people want to spend it on things. In bear markets it acts more as an investment because people will think it will go up in value later on. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:36:54

What matters then is water, food, etc. The situation you’re describing is **extremely** unlikely and would literally result in a martial law-type anarchy.

This is just one example, but it can be applied to almost anything. Your country needs weapons? Natural resources? Better tech? Here, we have some, but you need to use USD. 
This is how the USD became world reserve currency.

Fundamentals with Bitcoin have literally been stronger than ever. Bitcoin has had almost a decade to mature and advance, and as we can see, it is the foundation/base for all of crypto. 
Big money pumped the price up around the holidays, lots of newbies entered crypto. No we're seeing how weak the hands are of these newbies.

Nothing is for certain, so it would be stupid to put all of your life savings into Bitcoin. Still, I personally believe that there is a higher chance that this is the bottom (or near the bottom) than this NOT being the bottom (or near the bottom).

Kind of funny seeing all the doom and gloom. I’ve been here since 2014 and this doesn’t phase me one bit. No intention of selling *some* until at least 2024 (my original plan was a 10 year investment), but I think at that point it wouldn’t really be “selling”, I’d just spend the coins (and I’ll never spend all of them).

Some of the comments show just how much misinformation and misunderstanding is out there when it comes to Bitcoin and crypto in general. Heck, I was speaking with some finance friends a few days ago about Bitcoin and they *still* lack a basic understanding of the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin.

The US dollar is the world reserve currency- how do you think it became that way?? You think every country just magically decided to use US dollars one day? Of course not. 
The US dollar is the world reserve currency because the US the strongest nation in the world and a global empire- ALL of that stems from the **US military** (which is literally more powerful than many countries *combined*)

Finally! I don't expect tons of money to immediately pour in, but the floodgates have certainly been opened. It's not a matter of *if* this money comes into crypto, but *when*. I'm also very glad that they'll be expanding to Asia hopefully by the end of the year. If you're a long term holder of these coins, you'd be insane to sell at any point over the next 3-5 years.

Meh. Wayyy too many steps to go through just to get btc. What's the point in going to an ATM, entering a phone number, date of birth, credit card pin, all just to get some paper slip that has a pin code on it in order to redeem the bitcoins online. Why not just buy them online in the first place? 
Pretty pointless imo, not to mention the fact that 99.99% of stores in South Korea have no clue what Bitcoin even is.
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:12:18
He's right. Using dollars is FAR easier than using Bitcoin, and to the average Joe, Bitcoin is still confusing and tough to use. Like AA said, there's all this random jargon that makes it confusing, and people don't want to have to go through this whole process of linking a bank account to an exchange, buying coins, etc. It's too much work when they've already got a bank account and can already quickly pay for something with the swipe of a card. 
Bitcoin is great, and I love it, but we've got a long way to go.

@_date: 2015-02-03 00:32:52
"There are roughly 10 million people in the world who hold bitcoin; there’s less than a million people who are actively using it for payment. If you believe that we’re going to get a billion people in bitcoin — in 21 million coins — the only way, is by the price going up. It’s simple math. And going up a lot. A half million dollars, a million dollars a coin — something ridiculous like that.”
