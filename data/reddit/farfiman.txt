Interesting- same percentage as the mining split more or less.

Yes, but it could take a very long time. It isn't one "mempool" but many and it usually will drop off after they reset the server etc.

It's not only about the price but the mempool problems. Unless tx's go down way under 4/sec it won't clear anytime soon. True that the majority of those are very low fee and probably will never go through but even the ones at 200-300 sats/byte are having problems.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:04:32
True - 0.0025 is about right.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:44:39
It is unusable as a currency (for any tx lower than a few hundred bucks) at the current state, we can't hide our heads in the sand.

"This is not new. One of the top mining pools in the world has over 250,000 participants and has mined 445,000+ Bitcoins. As of this writing, one Bitcoin is worth $525. So this one mine has generated what would be worth over 223 MILLION in US Dollars worth of Bitcoin at the $525 value."

@_date: 2014-11-07 08:55:45
I have been doing the same in the last few weeks, mostly on non bitcoin related channels (besides madbitcoins :) )
Some people are amazed and are very thankful (and of course are introduced to bitcoin for the 1st time) some don't react and don't collect it.  I would say so far about 75% are collected and the rest are refunded after 7 days.
One person was VERY thankful at the gesture but said he doesn't really need the money so I encouraged him to spread the word and tip someone else with it.
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:30:22
You could also kick yourself if it would rise to 800.

You can see the collection situation on the changetip site of course.
I go to the ones that collect to read the responses.

"At the time of writing, OKCoin’s website had been taken offline. In the coming days, it is likely that the exchange will release a statement apologizing for the outage and attributing the erratic pricing behavior to a bug, and trading data will subsequently be wiped from the record. Most people will believe them, but truly insightful individuals will see through the facade, recognizing that this statement was likely written by a clandestine government agency and published by the exchange operator under duress in order to conceal evidence of time travelers from reaching the general public."

You can make jewelry with gold BUT if it was it's main use then the price would be maybe 1/10 of today. Stocks? Their price is so overvalued I can't even begin.

Just to be accurate it isn't fraction of a cent per tx but per byte. A "standard" tx of 225 bytes would cost minimum of 2.5 cents. To be sure to be in the next block you would still need to use 5-10 cents- STILL very cheap!

"bitcoin" can't pull anything, People have to do it and no people will ever do that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:25:21
Many altcoins have gone up x10 to x100 compared to BTC in the last few years so if you hit the right one you win big time.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:59:34
this is a scam- whats the chance of another person having this problem in such a short time?
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:32:57
"since june-july 2017"...  that was just a few months ago. Yes, btc has been much stronger since but it can and will flip again. Timing is always the problem of course.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:12:02
There is no chance but even if you did somehow transcend all statistical probabilities - the chances are enormously high that it will have zero satoshi's in it.

OK- ill change it-

I was asking a reasonable question.
And I don't beat horses- dead or alive. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:21:27
Transaction id ?
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:10:01
I'm not butthurt, just stating a fact.
How many of those coins were sold?
How many were kept by the lucky few that created them?
Maybe there should be a little asterix besides DRK on coinmaketcap like other premined coins?  I'm not saying you can't have a premine- but it should be KNOWN by everyone that buys into the coin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:56:59
Think longer term.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:50:58
You asked if there is a chance that it won't recover.
I never said it's the best asset.

@_date: 2015-03-22 14:34:09
I just don't see what the difference is as far as the amounts of coin coming into existence.  (we premined or "oops a bug mined us a ton of coins") . semantics.

In bitcoin this graph happens over and over but each time at a higher price.  If you want to move out a bit we are barely at media attention.
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:06:26
I have asked if anyone knows this info- some were sold- some were not. How many miners were there in the 1st 8 days? How many coins were kept by these people?
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:14:20
No, there is room for many coins/assets.  Can a different one surpass btc? Sure. Still bitcoin will survive and at a much higher value than today.

This type of ransomware encrypts data only like documents ,pictures etc.  The computer still works fine, and you can use the internet and all other applications.

Don't need "mass adoption". How many people are in crypto? A few million world wide? It's a drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:50:14
No problem-   2 MILLION instamined coins.
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:55:56
DRK supporters are such nice people.
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:43:23
Us cards should work fine. international cards is a matter of luck. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:42:45
I am not. I have no problem with DRK as long as all its investors know it's history.

fake news for now.
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:51:38
Actually it isn't. It is by intent to always be worth LESS over time.
The US inflation target basically guarantees it. Now social security IS a pyramid scheme....
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:19:12
Well, it basically was before the public launch....  whats the difference if those coins were created by "accident" or intentionally in the 1st 8 hours of existence before most people had a chance to mine them? 
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:37:56
You cannot compare satoshi and bitcoin to any coin that came after it. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:03:29
No law, no. But being civil is better. I never cursed anybody, called them stupid or any other derogatory name.   I saw people talking about the instamine and asked a question, thats all.
enough of this-it's tiring me.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:02:38
You sound like a sore loser.
There might have been a small amount of luck involved but not much. It's just that the majority of people that knew about it decided not to invest in it mostly because of lack of knowledge, MSM  etc..
The smart ones did and deserve to benefit from that.

Agenda-  take profit- buy back lower.
@_date: 2017-07-07 04:49:12
Buy one of the older wants (much cheaper) and see what it is like. I would say it's entertaining but nothing you can use to plan anything.Lots of ambiguous claims and mumbo jumbo but still enjoyable like a sci-fi book :)
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:54:25
I managed to link an international card right at the beginning. After it expired 6 months later I could not link the new card. Same Card, same number, new security code on back- no luck.

Bitcoin isn't a "thing" like a smartphone or tablet. It is a system, an idea. It can transform so many things in this world. Things like that take much longer to "cook". Cola Cola or McDonalds was relatively easy to get into China. Now lets see how long Democracy takes.
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:24:27
The semantics are arguable- I'll give you that. 
Maybe someone else in the DRK community can give us an answer to how many coins the developers and friends kept. Possibly the right thing to have done was burn those coins.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:23:46
You don't understand bitcoin... or people.

I would follow the relevant threads on bitcointalk forum. Many people there lost coins , some have lost thousands. If there is ever any chance to get anything back ( chances are zero) you will find out there.

If your goal is more btc (and not fiat) then it will eventually run away from you while you are on the wrong side (fiat).

I think what he means  is would the last bitcoin ever mined be worth more because it's rare.
I this case there isn't the last bitcoin. Maybe the last satoshi, but by then there might be an even bigger division
of the bitcoin to smaller than satoshis.

There is a "proper" exchange called bit2c
