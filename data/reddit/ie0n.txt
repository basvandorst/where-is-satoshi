Thanks for your help :)
The address I gave my friend is empty and never received anything. The Code did start with a 1 though, but I thought the address had spaces in it, which were just for easier reading. I'll try to contact the website with my friend this evening.

The number I sent my friend (with the spaces) was
12e7 AJWN EYZZ PKyL 4Was NCBN K367 haoZ qa
he entered it with the spaces
Nothing arrived from the paysafecard service and I was wondering what could be the issue.

I typed it out and checked it twice, because you can't copy the address in the app

My Balance shows zero, blockchain.info says it's empty. I didn't reinstall, but I restarted my phone and the app a couple of times. I couldn't find the previous addresses, but there was an automatically created backup of a different. When I tried to load that one, it "resynchronized with the network", but I still didn't get my first address.

I'd like to, but the community rules are against it. It was 34 numbers and letters, starting with 1, but I set spaces every four characters because the address was formatted that way in the app for better readability.

I have the address, but I can't set it anywhere in the app :(
