I'm excited to buy second hand CDs from other people online with Bitcoin, and no third party middleman taking a cut :)

So, what puzzle are they solving to get them? I'm vaguely familiar with cryptography and have a compsci/coding background.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:13:39
Am I right in thinking that there are an infinite number of possible number of unique Bitcoins, and 'miners' essentially brute-force discover them?
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:50:39
So, is there a brute-force element in BTC mining?
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:54:49
Seems to vary pretty wildly.
Sorry if this has been done before, couldn't fine one like this online.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:31:39
It's all the blocks I had to hand, genesis block to now.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:37:04
Yeah, I've heard people aren't big fans of that site/service.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:28:53
Thankoo! :)
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:55:48
Yeah, you're about right. I might do another one that is 35k wide, but probably not.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:04:58
A per-zero net search facility would be really good too, might look into that.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:08:16


Is the whole database downloaded each time, or is the torrent smart enough to just add the update?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:10:49
Well, that's my plan for this evening sorted.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:03:07
Wow, this is incredible, really. So, I have a few questions:
* Would I be able to create a Reddit clone for ZeroNet, and would I need a bot to process requests, or could it operate without the author machine being online?
* Are you aiming for one huge ZeroNet, or lots of little ones, like subreddits?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:08:52
Also, have you created a subreddit for this? Looks like is taken, but it would be good to have a separate one.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:20:51
Yes :) I don't have the address on me at the moment, but I managed to get a decent test page together that was capable of swapping out the content of a template, taking data from per post json files. This way a whole db doesn't have to be downloaded on change.
Browsers fiercely prevent you creating local files for security reasons though, so until web socket API, you have to add posts manually.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:23:51
Okay cool. So I'm thinking of putting together a way of exporting posts from a wordpress site into an SQLite database, and a viewer page that reads the local db.
I'm trying to work out whether it would be easier in the long run to just add scripts to add content to the database, or just add the text of each post to a small file and sync those down. Thoughts?
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:07:56
Hooray! very exciting :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:59:50
Okay, I'll try having posts as json files then.

EVERYTIME I DO I PLOT A PAAATH
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:34:26
Yeah, that's the first place I looked , but I needed a bit more grasp on the data so I used a blockchain parser.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:35:28
What is the maximum blocksize, btw? I read that there's a max size but couldn't find it.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:58:23
Yeah, I was thinking about that earlier, 50 btc right now would be easier to mine and more profitable than just transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:27:54
Sounds about right to me.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:04:36
Ah, ok. It's just that my internet access is a bit crap. If my connection drops out, can I resume?
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:05:35
I'm so pumped, and I'm glad others are, too. I just want the ability to buy CDs from people online without giving money to amazon (ebay is a bit better but not much).
@_date: 2015-04-15 10:58:19
This is actually really interesting, I hope they get a Windows version of the script. Loading stuff via Tor might be a pain, but it's the price you pay for anonymity I guess.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:14:45
Oh, that's pretty cool. Might give it a go later on.
Is there any possibility that I could pay for a file, then download it once it's complete?
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:26:16
Has your btc miner paid for itself yet?
