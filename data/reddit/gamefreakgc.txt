Lesson learned? Don't make rash promises.

Currently 217,000 unconfirmed transactions. Welcome to the Bitcoin network...

Yes, this is why Bitcoin Cash will be a flop. There's no adoption or use for it, other than just speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:17:09
Beat me to it!
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:51:03
Spend less time on Reddit my friend. It will do you good.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:07:30
And Reddit isn't?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:21:31
I find myself on r/bitcoin less and less, it's getting quite rediculous. I used to also check out r/ethtrader, but that sub is a complete disaster now.
You can usually find me in r/bitcoinmarkets and r/litecoinmarkets, it is a trading sub, but there's way more intelligent conversation there.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:16:52
Don't feed the trolls... just downvote and move on.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:07:11
If your kids are stealing your money, I don't think buying plastic is addressing the real issue here...
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:39:09
This would matter if there was actually any significant investment capital in Vietnam :( These south-east asia countries are very poor. But, adoption is adoption I guess.

SEC ruling on Bitcoin ETF in March was a big one.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:18:09
Oh, I must have linked it wrong. It is a real sub, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:46:14
bitcointalk.org. Reddit is too immature for anything more, they post a "lol" on here and then post a picture to [It's the ultimate place for people with ADD.

The day is not over yet, so don't bet on it!
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:19:36
Log scale my friend. It doubled in 3 months, which is awesome, but the run up to 55B required countless doublings to get there.

Previas come with an option to have a factory installed supercharger on them too if you really want to go fast!
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:07:33
You know there's a trading metric based on the number of memes on the front page right? Some of us would be lost without these pointless posts!
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:40:28
Yeah, I know. But I wasn't hurting to pay off the loans, I could pay the monthly payment and all that just fine. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:43:22
My tip?
Buy bitcoin in 2013 or 2014 and save it if you can.
Anyone else won't see millions unless you have massive capital to start with.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:17:59
I disagree.
I bought bitcoin in 2013 and had $20,000 in bitcoin during the run up to $240. I decided to sell and pay off my loans.
Guess how much that would have been now? $648,000.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:16:43
I think we can all safely say it has nothing to do with maintenance, BTC-e will not be open for trading any time soon, if ever again.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:40:16
Oh, what is he on trial for then?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:14:15
Was wondering why the news on that site was so biased and seemed to always come out later than the rest of the news sites.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:39:47
Yeah I remember that, they used to have that stat on their main page. To be willing to take on stolen funds from a competitor though, that's low.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:46:19
I was looking for something like this the other day!
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:31:16
Oh gosh, this is BTC-e! They were founded around the same time as Mt. Gox, there is no other exchange that old.
Wow, I'm really shocked. There's a lot of funds tied up on that site too.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:21:39
It's a whole lot more than a few, that's for sure. Lovin' this daily volatility.
If you're that concerned about the rises and dips just hodl.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:16:02
Dunno, if they end up seizing funds it might go to repay the Mt. Gox users!
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:19:04
Russ Ulbright was sentenced to prison time for running Silk Road. He didn't buy guns, hire hitmen, but he knowingly facilitated it. The authorities could make the same case for BTC-e, they didn't steal people's money but they knowingly allowed the funds to pass through their exchange and financial accounts and helped convert Bitcoins to fiat for the "bad guys".
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:02:23
I figured due to their proximity being in Russia, they were indirectly related to all the Russian hacks and ransomware and all that. No idea the FBI was tracking them waiting for them to slip up.

In his Twitter post he says "Jihan's Bitcoin", which is referring to Bitcoin ABC/Cash.

The number 666 is good luck in China. 777 for western cultures.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:14:17
I've always written it off that Karpeles as part of the heist at Mt. Gox. If all this news is true, this completely changes my perspective of that whole nightmare.
I was super lucky, I pulled out my funds only weeks before Mt. Gox closed down.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:10:48
He said that Bitcoin Cash would be 500k. So you've got the wrong coin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:32:41
Google translate!
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:41:56
Shut up, that will never happen. We'll be lucky if we ever see $250 again. Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:20:22
Only took them 6 years to update anything LOL
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:33:03
Well, he's still on trial, but this totally changes things.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:36:33
If this is true, this is huge. BTC-E was in cahoots with the Mt.Gox hack? Mind blown.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:49:05
It has every element!
Mark (played by Jack Black) playing Magic the Gathering with his buddies: I've got this dream to create an online exchange for Magic the Gathering! What'd ya think?
Friend: That's cool, but have you heard of 'Bitcoins'? *tells Mark what a bitcoin is*
Mark: That's aweeesoooome! But I already bought the domain name... I know, we'll use it anyway and just abbreviate it. Mtg Ox?  Meeting Ox? Mt. Gox? Mt. Gooooox!! DONE!
