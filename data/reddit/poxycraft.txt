Can't people take all his bitcoins when they have the private key?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:00:30

In all honesty, he was much better spoken than the amazon rieviews make him out to be.

I've read so many good things about VoS.

Don't take this is the wrong way, but he could also practice his german too!

Why are people so up in arms about altcoins over here in Is it because they may from time to time make make bad press for crypto currency? To me altcoins seem like the perfect way to test things on a lower scale.

Do they accept SEPA accounts? or is it US only? 
(I might not be making sense. Sorta a noob.)

I'm a noob, but an adventurous one at that. Can anyone help me (link me?) with a noob proof guide to cold storing my sweet bitcoin.

Jeg tror at jeg kommer til å være den eneste 16 åringen der..
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:25:01
I thought SEPA sort of requiers the whole ID, but thanks ill definantly look into it!

I thought blockchain was less secure? 
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:17:33
I was sorta thinking the exact same thing! I have like 2 friends who would be up for it. I just think that Norway is not there yet for an actual event. We are too few i assume, but maybe we can do something to see how many of us their are and than go ahead from there.

I have a I Pad that NEVER gets used. How did you do this? I would love to use the ipad to monitor my mining. It would free up a 21 inch screen that i'm using right now. Do you have a link or some advice?
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:22:54
I don't need any bitcoins. Just wanted use a bitcoin ATM for the sake of using a bitcoin ATM. God påske brur! :D
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:00:06
Thanks, looks really well made and legit. Definitely gonna look into this!
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:32:28
Amazing, tons of thanks!!! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:06:50
Thanks alot, I would tip you some Doge. But i hear that it's not taken so kindly here. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:28:54
I see Bitmynt.com recommended all over the place! I feel like everyone uses it. I've personally been using justcoin.com. There are literally no problems i've had. They also tend to have "lower" prices too for BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:24:56
Ok, thanks for the url. I won't be going to finland any time soon though. :/ Hopefully while i'm on vacation ill get some time too find a ATM. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:30:05
I'm curious of what you think about Dogecoin and its community? Please tell if you want too. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:22:43
Jeg har lyst å kjøpe alt fra 0,1 til 1 hel Bitcoin. Er det noe vi kan gjøre for at det blir et sikkert kjøp?
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:41:35
Oh! Now i understand, sorry for my misinterpritation. Makes more sense now, just out of curiosity. What do you think is happening? Is the accountactually Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:10:51
I'm a optimistic soul i guess, but i think it might be him just he wants us to keep wondering. He did enough for the dorean fact and that's after all what he wanted to do. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:38:08
Ahh. This might be a REALLY stupid question and especially in light of recent events, but what the hell. Can i buy my Bitcoins with an exchange like Kraken which uses SEPA and than transfer my BTC to coinbase and use coinbase as a wallet. I really am scared of going local with mine and coinbase seems like a super legit wallet/exchange. Is coinbase a wallet? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:48:59
Sounds great. One other question while I'm at it. This is all hypothetical. I'm a US citizen and im under 18 in age. Can my bank account in the US work to buy on coinbase or do you have to be over 18 to buy on coinbase. 
Edit: Im bad at americano...

Can you explain GPG signature?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:27:46
Tipbots are "simply genius" in my opinion. You can show gratification for someone and spread something you like in a smart and simple way.

Since satoshi is reportedly alive, he would probably know about the biggest one of the biggest bitcoin communitys. Saotshi our hero could venreading my post. Just the thought of him scrolling r/bitcoin makes me feel good. He can disapear forever and live in peace if he wishes this.
