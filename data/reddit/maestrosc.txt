You have a future wife already planning for your divorce... and you are still marrying her?
Get a pre-nup, or i guarantee you we will be reading a Scumbag Stacy from you within 5 years.
If someone is demanding something from you in your divorce settlement before you even get married... dont fucking marry her.
This is literally the dumbest question I have ever seen on reddit... i cant even recall a close 2nd, and I once read a question from a guy who was asking why the Dragon Ball live action movie was so bad...

seriously... every single time it drops any decent %... people spam this retarded rhetoric.
Bitcoin has given off risen 6000% in the past decade... and every time it dips or "crashes"  people spam the same stupid shit... and within a year those same people are deleting their accounts/comments... until it falls again.

Do you watch SC2 streams at all? The same people who were pulling 2-3k are now lucky to get 1000. The people who used to get 10k are lucky to get 3-5k.
Tournament streams are getting close to HALF of the numbers they used to pull in 2k11 and 2k12.  Saying Tournament viewership is up...maybe for this year, but not in the scope of SC2 esports as a whole, not even close.

Dont invest in a dying esport. I understand youre a TB fanboy so you want to put money in his pocket... but if you actually want to gain something sponsor Dota 2 or League of Legends... games that are actually growing in popularity and are making more fans  and not losing them
As someone who has followed esports/SCBW/SC2 ...  dont invest or waste your money on esports, tho i guess its not technically just yours anyways.

Because if you buy 3000 coins... you are not interested in selling them for less than you paid.
If you bid and lost... you know what you bid. If the current price is lower than what they sold for... you know what the owner of the winning bid thinks they are worth more than current price/your bid.
In speculation, what the highest bidder thinks they are worth is what sets the price.

WTF else is investing? You are risking your current money, to gain more money in the future. That is what investing is. It is hardly nothing. You risk throwing away what you currently have/have earned, for the chance at getting back more than you put in, in the future.
Saying the lotto, and investing is the same thing, just shows how fucking retarded you are. Most people would argue that people who have made their wealth/careers investing, arent "doing nothing". Tell that to ever single trader throughout history.
This is literally one of the dumbest analogies for investing I have ever read in my life, accompanied by one of the dumbest arguments.
ITS AMAZING to think of how many profitable traders just seem to "hit the lotto" (according to your analogy) every year.

This is amazing, and exactly what i have been wanting.
I use coinbase, because frankly i trust them to secure my BTC more than I trust myself to secure/store it safely.
Also, I dont see the relationship/similarities they share with MtGox at all.
Coinbase is backed by legitimate reputable entities, and at this point they are aguably the most notable reputable US based company dealing with BTC... and tbh if Coinbase fails..its most likely that BTC has also failed in which case if they cant give me back my worthless BTC its not that big of a deal.
I really like the idea of an enhanced security storage for long term holdings. And something that will make me jump through hoops to prove that the person who is taking the coins out, is actually me.
The  problem Bitcoin faces atm, is cyber crime, and the inability of the average user to keep/secure their BTC.
Right now it is financial suicide for your parents/friends/family to put any decent amount of $$ in BTC, because 90% of them are working on a compromised PC and their BTC will get stolen within a week.
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:18:40
Bitcoin is far more traceable than dollar bills.
The anonymity is common misconception.
You can track the history of every single BTC in existance, the "anonymity" of it  comes from whether or not you can tie to the address to a name or not.
Every single movement of BTC from 1 wallet to another is tracked and kept forever on a public ledger.

O well, ordered 2 new BenQ monitors, paid with BTC. Am going to be ordering a Tv and 2-3 wall mounts in the next week or 2, I have saying for weeks that "whoever accepts BTC first will get my business" so i am more than happy to spend BTC at Tigerdirect =)
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:22:51
Tell that to every single early investor in Microsoft.  
By investing in BTC now you are investing in the insfrastructure, stability, and future of BTC. You are just too moronic to even be capable of understanding that.
Basically your argument is "THE RETURNS ARE TOO BIG FOR THIS TO BE AN INVESTMENT".
So basically, anyone who has ever invested initially into companies that have gone on to be fortune 500 companies, they essentially did nothing, and weren't investing...they were gambling! Because their returns were too high for YOU (and only you... the sole retard who separates gambling/investing by the amount of ROI) to classify it as investing rather than gambling?
WTF you have literally been responsible for 3 of the dumbest things ive read on the internet today. Keep going, this is like having a retarded 8 ball, but when i ask it questions  instead of giving me answers/advice it just spews out more stupidity.

this is what people severely underestimate about the current price of BTC. We are literally always 1 obscure  incredibly rich person from astronomical growth.
even if you take out 1 incredibly wealthy..and substitute it..with adoption by average citizen...
For instance on Facebook, i have 300 friends... out of 301 people, I am the only one of them invested in BTC, buying into it.
What are we really at   market penetration and adoption wise? Maybe .05% ? and thats being incredibly generous. And we are at 660 atm.
.05% = 660.
Its why it makes me laugh how everyone laughs off other peoples' ridiculously huge guesses that BTC might trade for 100,000 per 1 coin eventually.
We are already at 660 per BTC despite 99.5% of the world population not even touching it atm.

75% of my savings/checking.
Not a life changing amount(if i lose it all) as im only 25 and have only been saving for about a year...
but enough that if it goes to 5000+ per btc  its definitely a life changing amount..
I like to keep a certain dollar amount in my checking account at all times just in case... the rest ive been averaging down into BTC, got my average to 550 per coin.

Well if you make a living investing in conventional stocks... why would you encourage people to pull their money out of conventional stocks and put it in BTC?
His money depends on people putting their money, and continuing to put their money in those stocks. He only makes money on his stock, when someone else loses money on it, or other people buy into it. In which case He can sell for the profit they provided him.
This is what i think 90% of the population doesnt understand about stocks and the stock market and investing in general. Whenever someone is making money, that means there is another fellow somewhere who lost that money.
When you buy low and sell high, the person you bought it from lost the money, by giving away his opportunity to make money betting on its future. When you sell high, you are essentially dumping it onto someone else, after you have already milked it.
What does Warren Buffet have to gain by being pro-bitcoin, when he made his entire existence based on the current investing/stock system ?

Noone KNOWS if the real estate value of anything will ever increase.
They make informed guesses.
Thats what investing and speculation is.
There is no "hey, if you buy this property, you will get free money! YAY!"
You can only speculate on the real estate market as much as you can speculate over any other market.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:09:29

ya.. because so many investment properties yield 6000% returns over a 5 year period.
or 500% in a year,
or 1600% over a 2 yr.
I managed to get about a 60% return over a 2 year period with a house I bought at the beginning of the upturn 5 years ago and I did great.
Havent seen many people bust out 6000% return on a property.

this house was a decent investment, problem was I had to throw away an amazing investment to afford it.
it fucking sucks.
Even now, though. I have more money in BTC than in my checkings + savings.

LMAO i love the way the world tends to work itself out.
For clarities sake, I am not saying bitcoins will never crash, because I admit I dont know the future. However, I just find it amusing when people are hoping for others to fail... which there are a SHITLOAD of on reddit.  
Its truely disgusting to see so many people rooting for other redditors to lose money, simply out of jealousy and negativity...
Today was a sickening day, not even watching the market, but watching the scumbags of reddit, who were so anxious to gloat about other people losing money...

a the same time a single hedgefund that is large enough... could make bitcoins value go up 10x over night... especially if you had multiple hedgefunds large enough to work together to do so.
The scariest part of bitcoins is that this is extremely possible. As someone did the math above, if 100,000,000 got invested in Bitcoin next week, we would see bitcoins jump to nearly 100k per coin. Which they could then essentially slowly cash out on their bitcoins at their new price they set....   
Completely theoretically possible.. and why I will never dump all of my BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:35:10
lmao. Because writing "any1" out of convenience clearly means I am incapable of knowing how to write out "anyone".
Everyone who uses acronyms must be fucking idiots eh? 
Get a life if you cant handle people shortening words or using acronyms that you clearly understand. Unless you are incapable of reasoning that "any1" is just a shorter way to write "anyone". lmao

Even buying on coinbase is a bit of a nightmare when it comes to risk. Seriously buying and then being stuck with it for a minimum of 4 business without being able to sell it, even at a loss if you need to in the next 4 days... is why I havent spent much more on bitcoin.
Its soooooo hard to buy on coinbase when you know that you:
A. are stuck with that decision for 4 days and cant control your fate at all (you cant control a market or what happens or how the prices change however you can control whether you make a move or not... which you cant even do that if you buy through coinbase)
B. Cannot make any purchases while you have a purchase pending for 4 days. This is also a nightmare...Hypothetically... u buy .1btc at 1k. Prices are now at 700 and you actually want to buy more... o wait you cant come back in 4 days.
