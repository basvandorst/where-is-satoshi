The Winklevoss Twins were at ground zero for the creation of Facebook. This is what I am referring to.
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:31:55
It'd be nice if they would at least mention this in the sidebar.
@_date: 2019-07-26 07:04:36
As a rule of thumb, I don't take tax advice from 3 week old reddit accounts.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:24:07
When most of your wealth isn't in USD, bringing the USD down brings up everything else.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:48:04
Sell Outs?
Do you know who the Winklevoss Twins are?
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:23:12
I mean, 
who do you think does the bulk of mining?
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:56:14
Interspersed with brief periods of high-frequency head chopping.
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:08:53
Does that not sound like an infinitesimally small percentage of the miners to you?
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:30:27
wake me up at 19k

Paying for cloud storage with cryptocurrency is not revolutionary.
@_date: 2019-07-06 01:14:18
There have been some tip bots running long enough that people forgot about the tiny amounts of BTC they were tipped years ago.
I checked, and mine were still there, ready to be withdrawn.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:14:33
Is this like the custom passphrase that you add to the end of your 24 word key? or am I misremembering something
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:28:25
You'd see a period of time where the system was overwhelmed, and transactions with low fees may be ignored.
If they were offline long enough, eventually a difficulty decrease would happen.
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:47:11
Know what I say? Russian operatives are ALL OVER reddit spreading FUD 7 days a week, and most of them have usernames like @_date: 2019-11-15 22:26:08

@_date: 2019-11-22 17:17:02
Buy more every time it drops below a new $1000 barrier. Thank yourself after the Chinese New Year ends when BTC always goes back up
@_date: 2019-11-19 01:05:22
I'm waiting for the money you're supposed to send me before engaging further with you.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:31:38
You don't actually refute any of what they said by quoting and typing laughter at it.
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:42:01
Racial how? He's just another old rich dude in a sea of old rich dudes
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:51:33
LOTS of people care. That's why this is a controversy.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:02:13
What do I have to gain by refuting you? You're a fucking NOBODY.
Are you going to pay my literal money to keep engaging with you? $30/hour you pathetic worm.
@_date: 2019-11-15 23:10:15
You win.
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:25:34
I used to mine with my laptop CPU and you don't wanna know how many BTC I sold off.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:07:24
I mean, I saw above; that's why I'm here wondering what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:52:32
Any time an article asks a Yes/No question in the headline, the answer is: No
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:04:17
Have you ever actually held a job?
I thought not.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:03:44
That's actually not the definition of slavery.
The CHOICE is yours.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:40:45
What is work? 
Some people have hobbies that they enjoy, that other people would consider to be un-fun, and worklike.
Some people do something because they know it needs to be done.
Some people would prefer to spend their time relaxing, socializing, etc.
Being free to have the option not to work at all is precisely the opposite of slavery. When society is able to care for people who don't want to work, or who are unable to work, then we'll be in a good spot.
Being forced to rely on money to survive? That's closer to slavery than the alternative.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:30:38
If the story is true, then it doesn't matter to me who reports it.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:02:46
What pension fund? Most of us can barely afford to survive
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:00:50
That's literally not slavery. 
I'm not going to let you live the dream where it is, because the definition of the word is actually pretty specific.
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:28:09
You're delusional if you believe that there aren't people who build houses for free right now, today.
Habitat for Humanity does this.
People (obviously not selfish people such as yourself) often enjoy helping people out. To some, this is its own reward.

@_date: 2019-08-16 17:48:40
You're being downvoted, OP, because your question presupposes something that isn't even true.  
The average person has no idea what Bitcoin is. End of story.
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:44:19
Much like how sausage is a genius way to pack, preserve, and ship ground pork products.

Of course it's speculation, but it's not an unreasonable thing to assume as a possibility. Global politics is a dirty game.

Yes let me snatch them up like a hungry dragon

Not your keys, not your coins.
Most important lesson in this space, and it cannot be stressed enough.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:31:22
No offense, but those credit card fees won't vanish unless OP stops accepting credit cards.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:23:16
Why are you worried about altcoins?
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:53:13
They have to illegally force you to comply if you don't want to give them your keys.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:40:33
If there's no incentive to mining, then how do you account for all the people out there who are very clearly mining for profit?
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:50:38
Can't wait to get this safely stored on my hardware wallet.

@_date: 2019-04-11 19:48:26
Whatever you do, keep your currency off of the exchanges once you find a decent hardware wallet. 
Keeping the coins on an exchange gives them the power to deny you access to your money, for any number of reasons.
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:20:33
What else were they supposed to do with all that bcash they got for free?
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:39:28
Ya know, if we had socialized healthcare in the USA, they wouldn't have to worry about the expenses, and could actually get the procedure done.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:58:18
Sending your money to Bitpay is asking for Bitpay to steal your money.

Based on your username, you're too high to know WTF you're talking about, guy.
I'm not looking at your list of rich pricks. I don't care where they came from, nobody deserves wealth like that, because it comes at the expense of others.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:34:43
Man lots of us live in cities with millions of other people
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:02:41
How many tens of thousands of businesses operate in a city like Chicago? Atlanta? Dallas? 
Most people have no idea because our cities are humongous now.
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:19:27
It's the same as the earlier days of home internet access. People were afraid (some today might say rightly so) to spend money or do business over the Internet, and today it's probably one of the most common places that money is spent.
Stuff like this takes a LOT of time to prove itself to the general public.
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:02:37


You know some people have sinus conditions that necessitate breathing through the mouth.
and ANYWAYS, let's not pretend that Capitalism has ever provided for the common man.
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:18:10
I would encourage you to delete your Reddit account and educate yourself on politics before spouting this garbage. 
Your political views are embarrassing.
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:04:41
Seems like the US Gov would be a pretty strong negotiator, if our senators and representatives weren't already in the pocket of the insurance lobby.
Lobbying, a free market concept that routinely fucks over my friends and family.

My Shadowrunners always find a way in. That's why they get paid so much Nuyen.

No you couldn't.
You're a fucking liar, just like all the other trolls in this thread.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:02:58
What garbage.
@_date: 2019-04-16 00:00:42
I mean, starting an exchange wouldn't be the dumbest way to dump all of a free trashcoin that you received because of a fork.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:00:54
Actually, there is an entire political philosophy where people believe providing for other people is a good and important thing to do.
Probably several of them.
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:12:44
I disagree completely.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:10:06
Is that supposed to mean that partial privacy doesn't matter? I think not.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:51:10
I'm serious. The power to issue a chargeback is a big deal when you're trading with someone you may not fully trust.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:08:52
There are people who bet against BTC every day. What even is your point?
Some rich dude lost a lot of money. The end. Beyond that, I really don't even care about this enough to continue this asinine conversation.
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:39:08
Exactly. OP is trying to make a dig at the fella who lost the bet, and fella would probably be like "I've lost more money than you'll earn in your entire life, fool"
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:42:00
Why not both? 
Better to learn the lessons of the wealthy sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:38:12
Privacy is an ideal. Much like other ideals, it's existence in the real world is decided on degrees. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:35:56
I mean, it's no more associated with them than paper cash. People are going to think whatever they want re: politics but BTC is actually bigger than that.
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:40:02
Best advice you'll receive in this thread:
DON'T TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE HOLDING BTC
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:05:00
It makes more sense than attaching a bullseye to yourself.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:59:11
I'm not suggesting anyone skirt the tax laws in their country. Skirting the attention of the criminal element is the prime factor in keeping wealth a secret. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:57:25
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:19:08
OP has already proven my point. They started receiving strange DMs within hours of making the post.
You're welcome to put into practice whatever you like, but you can't avoid the general consensus that telling people about your wealth is not beneficial to you. The end.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:43:59
Nice, high quality rebuttal.
Congratulations on being a beacon of wisdom in these trying times.
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:22:09

Sorry, bots. The people here at know better.

This subreddit is not a monolithic organization with a unified set of beliefs...
and that's good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:20:35
For sure. Protect your ass(ets).
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:34:51
Don't be stupid.
Keep your financial information completely private, or you put yourself at risk.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:54:27
It's the world we live in, unfortunately. 
Best to make peace with it early, and focus on things within our control.
Like investing in BTC (while keeping your mouth closed about it).
OP is a great example of doing it wrong, and they've already started receiving strange inbox messages in less than a day.
OPs account is now and forevermore, a target.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:28:50
Oh so you're just here to remind us that privacy doesn't exist then?

Why is it so hard to get through to people like you? 
Robbers will pull a gun on a crowded bank for about the same amount of money. Do you have more security in your shitty apartment than a bank?
The answer is that, no, you don't.
Doxxing is against the rules on Reddit for a reason. Do you know why that is? It's not because it's so hard to find someone IRL based on their Reddit account.
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:31:42
Patreon doesn't have a responsibility to protect free speech on their own platform.
That being said, this is a tremendous opportunity for BTC to step in and fill the void.
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:33:41
Being ready to take a loss is one of the most important rules in finance.
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:24:19
Other than initial setup, what costs have you incurred by choosing to accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:07:11
Have you never heard the horror stories? People like the Winklevoss twins, Warren Buffett, etc, all have personal bodyguards on retainer. 
Wealthy people are often targeted for their wealth.  It's not a baseless fear for anybody who holds enough money to be worth murdering to someone else.
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:31:19
You should find a new hobby. You're bringing down the /r/ with your low effort shit post.
Nobody here cares that some rich dude lost some money. He doesn't even care himself. The fact that you're focused so hard on this is, quite frankly, annoying.
This conversation is over as soon as you inevitably think of some snide response, because you're exactly the kind of loser who _needs_ to have the last word.
@_date: 2019-01-23 05:41:13
I mean, it may be counterintuitive, but it's solid.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:02:20
Hindsight is 20/20 for that fella.

Any truly determined criminal will continue to hit him with the wrench until he tells the truth, and then dies.
The situation is better to be avoided entirely.
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:26:12
Why do banks have armed security guards?
The same reason people don't tell everybody when they become a millionaire. 
People are regularly extorted, kidnapped, ransomed, etc all for their money, and BTC owners are susceptible to the same kinds of attacks. 
Why would anyone with money to lose want to advertise it needlessly?
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:43:10
No .
Why would you ever mention these things casually? There's literally no reason to do it 
Your financial information is best kept private.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:45:27

@_date: 2019-01-23 18:36:18

Talking with you on this is a waste of my valuable time
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:31:48
You ought to be aggressively buying BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:44:45
I dunno. Bullish is standard Wall Street lingo and has been pretty well established over the past... century or so.
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:33:07
You're just misunderstanding the value of holding BTC long term.
The meme is stupid, but the advice it represents is the surest way to grow value as someone putting money into BTC.
 Buy and hold. One of the best strategies in this space, because it's virtually guaranteed to grow over a long enough period of time.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:48:34
Nobody knows.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:34:19
My only concern is that people who still take BCH seriously are going to take a hair cut.

I think, nonetheless, it would be a valuable lesson for anyone who stores their wealth in crypto to learn the easy way (rather than the hard way).
