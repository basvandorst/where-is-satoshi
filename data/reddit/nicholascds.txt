Bitcoin Cash is a venom to the crypto world.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:58:17

Hodl guys!! Just hodl it!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:52
Means you're looking up of BCH ,whereby BTC falls into more financial firm controlled commodity. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:18:37
In order to earn a Tesla, first u need to invest a milion, wait for two to three Months for a 50-80% growth of your BTC. The key is you need to have capital to make more wealth in BTC hodl 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:33:13
After the +400% mining difficulty adjustment on BCH, will the  money flow back to BTC? I dont think people will Hodl BCH for Long term. King is still King, long live BTC! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:15:48
Recommend any BCH buying platform? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:31:13
Have you try withdrawal successfully before? cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:45
No wonder its gone up so fast. Roger and Jihan are sterling up BCH fast. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:59:26
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:01:23

If I transfer my btc from Coinbase to Nano S or Trezor, after the fork how to I get my forked coin??
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:05:44
People are hoping the 2X fork will create 2X coin like during the Bitcoin Cash fork, therefore people can sell it for Money.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:06:08
End of day, people will only recognised Bitcoin as its the first cryptocurrency ever created and more and more hedge fund and billionaires are investing into it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:20:48
They may be covering up.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:00:22
Shld be some whales pumping dude.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:25:47
cant post photo in this post??! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:30:25
Its misleading, its saying considering giving it open until October, NOT confirm letting it operation until October. News is out on Huobi's Wechat Official Account. Ask some Chinese friend to go translate for you. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:25:32
what is DNM?
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:07:15
Seriously the whales are controlling the BTC price behind. All these fellas are waiting for a lower entry point, and when the wall street and world finance market big players are ready to enter crypto market, BTC price will shoot up like rocket like last Dec. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:45:29
I still remember the previous time we crossed $9000 and $19,000 was just two month away!! 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:48:56
Roger Ver shld learn to stop lying.
