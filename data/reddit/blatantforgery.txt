Notice the year in the picture... and the subprime mortgage issue the following year.

Umm why do they laymen assume that they should be able to understand crypto-currency without research understanding its fundamentals?  
You can use a dollar without knowing how they are printed, you can watch tv without a degree in Electrical Engineering, you can use crypto without knowing the algorithm. 
That said, discussing the viability of a television from a technological perspective, requires understanding of countless principles. Likewise for crypto, or any technology for that matter. This is the realm most discussion of crypto occupies; as such your opinion is only as valid as the assumptions you posit. If you cannot logically construct a concrete logical argument, let alone defend it, your opinion is less than worthless. Yes less than worthless, let me explain. 
A malformed, heavily flawed argument generally takes away from otherwise productive discussion via distraction, at relatively low cost to the questioner. Such a mechanism makes derailing conversation quite easy, thus requiring constant effort to ameliorate the concerns of the layman who are generally more easily convinced by less sophisticated arguments. 
The crypto elitists are generally frustrated with malformed and intractable questions being thrown around as valuable insight. Likewise the crypto newbies are frustrated by jargon. This is the case for largely any widely publicized technology, idea, or thought.

In order for the technology to evolve there has to reach a critical level of usage, development, and research into the topic. Then all that needs to be done is to demonstrate to the newbies that tech is safe and effective, when used as directed, and to encourage them to seek out the advice of their local (preferably paid) expert. Ads may help.
If the similarities to the medical industry in America weren’t subtle enough, there is a reason they take the strategy they do; it works.
They layman needs to feel safe, for any tech to flourish (see nuclear power, or the name chance of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging to MRI). Hopefully they are actually safe too.

I mean, if there are enough different smily you could use smileys as a number system, kinda akin to base 64 encoding
There’s also the option of pallet swapping the rgb values, within the smily you should be able to map those changes to something akin to a qr code. I think it would have a smaller range of values though

Yes, however unless you have a substantial number of them, more than 64 unique smileys, you’re better off encoding them in base 64.
Turns out there lots of em over 700... so the numbers should be 2/3s as long as base 64

Yes, that would kinda reduce the supply of BTC, and in effect push some miners out of the market. 
Tinkering with the supply of financial instruments is exactly what crypto was supposed to prevent. 
When you cannot trust the value of a financial instrument, runaway speculation tends to follow.

Provided BTC to whoever wanted it at that price.

That is akin to stating that because someone can invest their money, they won’t pay their rent.
There are fixed costs to living, so while an appreciating asset encourages ownership of said asset, it by no means prevents it from being a currency. Do you not spend money in your bank account just because it earns interest? 
The point is that regardless of the asset, the market is not perfectly efficient; arbitrage exists, bitcoin can survive it, so long as it’s volatility diminishes modestly.

So commerce is parasitic? Merchants, tradesmen, etc all exchange one resource for another hoping to come out ahead
