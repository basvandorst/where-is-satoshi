Wishing you a favorable outcome both in medical diagnosis and Bitcoin investment.

Well this is a great question.  I've accumulated a few bitcoins but so far I have inly used it for tipping.  What's worse is I have told a few charities to accpet nitcoins via changetipe or another mehtod and I would have not only dollars but I would try and get more involvement from the community.  No answer.  I didn't think people would turn down free "money".  This is a huge problem when you can't give away bitcoins.... and no, I know you all here would take them.  lol.

Your spelling sucks too.  I was on an mobile app.

Good morning!

"a" mobile app.  I stand corrected.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:36:09
5 slices on the way.  
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:23:38
Ok.  I'll play add some and pass it on.  
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:55:44
oops.  Thought I had collected the tip via changetip.  That's ok.  a little early perhaps but not a big deal.  Passed on to redcross efforts.  Probably better places but it'll work for now.  
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:20:45
Good morning! 
@_date: 2015-05-13 00:05:48
Thanks.  Forwarded 10X your tip to the redcross. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:05:47
Thank you! The red Cross also thanks you!
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:33:03
Got to love Tuesdays!  
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:43:18
You and another member (Bitsanbytes?) got me into the micro tipping world.  Very much appreciated.  Prior to that I was just holding a few bitcoins to check it out. Good luck in your future endeavors!
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:46:03
Thank you for taking over this program.  Back at ya to spread the love.  Normally would donate but I want to take more time researching other places than red cross from the list you gave above!  1000 bits
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:55:20
Wow.  Love to see that!  Great job!!!!  Pics would be awesome.  So would a short little press release from the hospital saying this was bitcoin funded.  Might not be a huge dollar amount but I know several charities that would be impressed with this type of donation and might be convinced to try it.
@_date: 2015-05-06 00:29:08
Not sure what to do with this.  But I'll pass it back to ya this time.  Its only a qaurter but hope it goes to something positive.  1000bits
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:36:43
Thanks.  Very cool this micro transaction. TONS of possibilities...wish I was smarter.  lol.  
Back at ya for your cause. Added a zero.  Hope I do it right.  Still learning.  1000 bits
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:33:55
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:06:02
1000 bits  please pass it forward here or to a charity of your choice!  
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:44:15
200 bits
Please add and donate to the Red Cross Charity...if I did this right
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:02:09
Glad to see ya!  Hope all is well in your world!!! 
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:24:56
Thanks!!! 
forwarded on!

Just set up accounts for changetip and such.  Fascinating stuff but way behind the eight ball.  Trying to learn it though!
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:38:09
Through  morning coffee giveaway program, I learned more about changetip and was successful in using it for this purpose.  Pretty slick...gotta be a way to harness this!  Thanks for the small "push" bitsenbytes!
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:08:08
Thanks!  Did not know that about transaction cost. Both transaction showed immediately.  Thanks.  Very interesting to see how seamlessly it works from a user perspective.  My first set of transaction using this.   I can see the value in this micro transaction.  Hmmm....
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:57:54
Just to see a transaction go through let me try this...Swap ya cups of coffee!  I know transaction costs get lost but its minimal and it does go to supporting the whole system, no??

Half a dozen transaction through coinbase cashing out and I can't recall a time it took 24 hours to get my funds....
