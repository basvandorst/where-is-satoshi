Could be. I was thinking about [this]( which might be overkill for a monthly subscription service.

But the [700k+]( transfer has been happening for over a year.

There will be a way to do this with feature already built into the  protocol called locktime. So for a year long subscription billed monthly, you will send your first month's payment over the blockchain to the subscription provider with a locktime one year on the future. They will then have your first month's pay in an address they own, but they won't be able to spend it until a year from then. 
Now here's the cool part. You'll be able to add more bitcoin to that address every month without using the blockchain, you'll send it directly to the company. This means no extra transactions fees every month. I imagine that scheduling the payments will be handled by your wallet software, which puts the control of canceling your subscription on your hands.

Google has a market cap of 389 billion. Bitcoin is about 11 billion. So it would be when 1 bitcoin is about 40,000 USD?

I just tried that and got a few mBTC that were missing from an order I cancelled yesterday. Thanks!

You don't have to give them your private keys. Look into bitcoin signed messages. If bitcoin succeeds, this will become a standard method to verify proof of funds.

Yeah, [here it is]( I didn't know what it was called. Very interesting.

Semi off topic. Isn't the some way to post date a transaction so the coins will move into an address at a specified date, but be in some sort of limbo in the meantime? I thought I've heard about that before, but I can't find any info now.

Also. Keep a copy of the private keys. There's a 50/50 chance they'll lose it.
