Well when Bitcoin starts adding glittery cannabis leaves and Nickelback songs to the blockchain I'll start worrying. 
You're talking about entertainment engines. Facebook and Myspace these things feed off novelty.  The kids left my space when it wasn't cool and then the Boomers ran them off of Facebook to Instagram, but these things are entertainment Based Services.  Nobody cares about novelty when you're talking about a store of value. Nobody says I don't want gold because I don't like the color anymore.

Exactly. BTC grew beyond anyone's wildest expectations this year. Of course it's going to have growing pains. Rushing ham fisted solutions to scaling is like a child wanting their toys right away. 
Of course proper scaling real development work takes time.

It's been used for more things in 2017 then maybe the last 6 years of its existence. That's the problem it's just too crowded right now. And maybe you're right not to wait for a decent second layer solutions.  I think we will know for sure in a year or two.

Well it's hard to stress test things without the stress. A lot of that came this year.

That's an expression.  He probably should've said, "I spoke of Bitcoin because"  But it just means he's referencing what he said earlier.

That's a scary thought. A racist from /pol/ with a penchant for /x/ larping can entice the minds of so many young people.  Most politicians are crooked regardless of party affiliation. But take a step away from /pol/ it'll leave you bitter.  Without compassion society will careen towards more tribalism based violence.

Those websites are for entertainment purposes. People expect a certain amount of novelty in those and they can grow tired of them.  People don't really grow tired of a store of value in the same way.  There's not a glittery cannabis leaf and blaring Nickelback song to drive people away from btc. 
The real danger is over fragmentation.  Look at the people in here already trying to get you to invest in their tourist trap coins.  Forks can be generated quite quickly and can take years for the market to decide that they have no value.  Meanwhile they're eating into the value of Bitcoin.  And in that case it's not Bitcoin that's getting broken up. It's indestructible you can't do that. But the confidence people have in it can be diverted and this is the point of attack that is being used.

I would be happy if the majority of the community was behind something at least. Trying to force an upgrade when you don't have the nodes but you have the miners, seems like trying to rule a country when you have the guns but not the people's support.  Whatever happens I just hope people don't  "destroy" Bitcoin by erroding trust people have in the process.

I'm not so sure. People expect a certain amount of novelty in entertainment websites. Even though Myspace and Facebook have real connectivity applications let's be honest here they are entertainment based. People don't really need or expect that out of stores of value.

Most money exists as 1's and 0's now anyways.  Very little physical cash compared to what's out there digitally.  It's all just an agreement we have with each other.  A construct.

I'm not fully up on things but I believe Japan just passed legislature to accept bitcoin as well.  Pretty huge.

Im a little confused.  So the BIP91 with 80% support will Not be supported by Coinbase?  Seems like they're going against the grain of the community or do I have it all wrong?
