If you're going to go ahead and be verified on both end, you might as well be verified on WU. OP could have transferred the 4000 to a bank account with WU for like $15. 
The fee is just for the convenience of withdrawing in cash from an agent.

No but it could be useful. In a world without cash, I could have print-on-demand fiat that is signed to my identity and good for one transaction
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:05:49
The 4% also pays for insurance on all that cash, and (shitty) customer service if you need to cancel or refund your transaction if the receiver can't pick it up

As a business owner, can confirm. I keep some of my own BTC but all crypto revenue gets converted immediately. Can't afford to have a bill come due and no cash. Maybe someday I can pay with BTC but for now its usd

You have to regardless?
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:19:16
Right. So you're paying more dollars but you're not losing more value because those dollars are worth less. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:17:31
Yeah, I'm not sure why anyone would think that it isn't. If you realize an economic gain, it's taxable. Whether it's gold or turnips
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:25:25
Yeah I assume that if he's okay with fees, it's not for investment purposes. Not everyone is into Bitcoin to make a quick  profit
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:19:48
Well if the dollar inflates 10% the real value of your taxes is 10% less.

I don't see it as a "tool to transform society." I can see the libertarian appeal, as the author notes, but really I'm more in it for the long term practicality and short term novelty. 
As a non-libertarian I'm annoyed by the way currency has increasingly become essentially privatized by credit card companies and private banks, because credit/debit cards have become a necessity for online transactions. Bitcoins are, to me, a way around that. 
So before trying to sell bitcoins as the tool of the, uh, crypto anarchist libertarian world-nation, it's more important to recognize the practical advantages of it.

I hear ya man.
 It does put you at the mercy of customers, but by-and-large people aren't assholes and putting up with a minority of jerks is just part of the job. usually it puts you at the mercy of your host or hostess who seats people. This person can make the decision about who to seat in your section. If anything, that's who you want to be on your side, not the customers.

It's true, but he was making a somewhat silly analogy to bonds, which are issued by banks. It makes more sense (I think) to think of BTC as a commodity that is mined and traded.

hey, this is a pretty good idea!

It took me several readings of this page to figure out what TDD stood for and I still don't understand *what* it is or *why* I would want to know how to do it, although I'm convinced you could teach me if I did.

How do you prove he hasn't paid you? I guess if you had a public address and public record keeping of all activity through that address, but that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

as it stands now, bitcoin is not really a "threat" to USD (especially since it's basically backed by USD at the moment).
The only real interest I can see the government having in it is if it starts being used heavily to launder money or send money to terrorists.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:59:29


this sounds reasonable but if you tell your employer you aren't getting that many tips, then your employer will have good reason to suspect you are providing shitty service (and in all likelihood you are...), and you don't have the world's greatest job security. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:19:14
on the other hand, suppose you are a company making a product that literally prints money for you.

Would you sell bread for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:34:29




in any case, he's right, it's what I meant. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 00:14:27
true enough, but the US has strategic energy reserves. If all electric companies stopped selling for some reason (?) the nation wouldn't be *completely* fucked. We'd still have water, sewer, and running gasoline/diesel pumps, and hopefully the Fed has some sort of contingency for people to withdraw cash without shitfucking the entire banking system. You'd have to set up your own generator, or run off your car's alternator, but it could be done. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:07:34
uh huh
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:40:53
fair, and I have to wonder how much of the "delay" comes from "testing"

Shit, that looks really good. I love sourdough. Just seems really American.
Not really sure how practical it is to ship bread to the lower 48. Well, I'd buy it if I had coin and somehow to move it and store it.

@_date: 2013-04-29 10:33:33
I think Barclays could give less shits if a couple (of thousand) individuals closed their accounts. They make extremely little money on holding your little checking account and retirement fund. If you wanted to actually hurt them you'd need to convince *businesses* to stop holding accounts/credit/loans with them.

@_date: 2013-04-30 00:07:11
basically, yeah. I mean, sure you might get some low tips here and there, but if you're making less than minimum after tips you're either doing something very wrong, or...there's no one eating at your restaurant (or some extenuating circumstance I guess) 
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:17:30
$20k/year is like a borderline poverty in the states (depending on the city), just for some perspective on OP's position. Most jobs with a B.S. degree would probably pay 30-40 entry level, so he's probably in that range. So roughly half a years salary.

yeah, when there's a short supply of labor *then* you can work on unionizing minimum wage jobs. If there's more people (like me) who are willing to work for less than the union demands than there are in the union there's no advantage to it.

Seems to work pretty well for google, though. Develop a new product/service that's better than our old model? Distribute it for free.

I like this idea. We're pretty good at organizing
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:40:59


right, and that what concerns me. While paying people in cash is problematic, at least there's a system in place to account for it (and money laundering around said system). Bitcoin seems to streamline circumventing it.
