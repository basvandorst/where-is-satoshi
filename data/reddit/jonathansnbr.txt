Woah dude zoom out to the one month chart and think about what you said 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:51:56
I don’t see an issue with it due to all assets being insured if there is a issue with the site that would cause a loss of cryptocurrency to users of the site
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:28:34
It took me 10 hours so idk what’s going on then
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:39:12
Sadly yes Coinbase said it has to be in your wallet by the 14th 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:35:07
Awesome so if I ride out the storm I should be ok I told my self I’m not selling until 2022 and what about the bitcoin being available in 12 days does that sound normal and I’m guessing I’ll be locked in for the amount I payed anyways right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:05:54
im just trying to keep buying as much as possible lol i know its going to go up after the weekend
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:41:06
I only seen one other time today I guess I missed it I’ve been at work all day
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:54:15
Imagine a bounce back to 7000
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:55:51
Sure thing buddy
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:28:05
Fidelity already said they will be launching theirs soon, their 400,000 employees already get to use bitcoin in their cafeterias
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:25:26
6400 on Coinbase, can I get an Amen brothers?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:38:36
What I would recommend go half in at what you are comfortable at and the half if it dips and if it doesn’t be happy at what you can get in at
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:10:35
86 dollars isn’t a huge investment I used my cash back I had saved and I did research that’s the only reason I bought it , with that research i did not find a specific yes or no to my question
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:37:37
What fork?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:50:00
Do you feel a correction is coming soon 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:19:50
So Ethereum... what do y’all think about that crypto? I want to invest in something that I could have full 1.0 of it lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:51:48
Thank you sir 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:03:50
I’ll just die in a hole
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:01:48
So what’s bitcoin gold all about every time I get on reddit it’s some new fork or upgrade or attacker lol it’s a lot to keep up with 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:16:57
Remind me in 2 weeks 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:26:29
Well I would at least think knowledge people would still like to give an opinion, I’m currently have some bitcoin but wanted to know if buying some ether would be smart
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:32:51
Long haul or short term investment that’s the real question 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:56:20
This is nerve recking idk how I should feel about this 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:19:04
I bought at 6400 and 6000 bringing my acquisition cost to 6800 per 1.0 I feel great right now!
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:30:37
Download exodus which is free and watch the videos about getting setup and bam and if you really want to be safe buy a TREZOR which is a even more secure way to store your money but it’s about 100 bucks I use both and I really enjoy them. Also Coinbase is having issues with sending and receiving bitcoins so expect a 2-24 hour delay on bitcoin transfers 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:32:18
We just broke 6000k baby!
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:23:03
Same here but I plan on getting more when it dips to around 6500 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:22:31
8k here we come!
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:23:41
It’s happening right now
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:17:34
I bought some at 6400 then at 6000 I’m happy and brings my total acquisition cost to 6800 per 1.0
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:00:45
I hope so, should I go in before the bitcoin fork or after do we usually see a correlation 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:23:53
Yeah it was around 20 min ago
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:10:09
I guess praying does work...
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:45:43
Not an exact date but someone told me it has to be in the account before the fork date so I guess if you get it prior to midnight on fork date you might be ok but buying and selling and buying will be disabled for 24-48 hours after the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:42:41
Congrats I’m trying to get into the 21 million club I got a good bit to go hopefully have a full 1.0 by January 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:24:31
At what price should I buy more bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:37
It’s beautiful 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:33:36
Bitcoin Cash is dead we are going to 6500 soon but might come back down to 6k or we are going to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:25:35
We get more of these and we will be too the moon in no time 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:23:41
Coinbase is having issues so I’ll take really long I did the same thing and it took 8 hours for mine to get to my TREZOR 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:46:28
Idk if I should buy more I have an alert set for 6500 and that’s when I would like to buy idk if It will get there though 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:07:28
Nope on the phone app or the website said zero stuff about it. I saw it didn’t go through and then I researched it and found their page saying it was down 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:25:28
So could you give me any info about the fork and how the bitcoin I would buy prior to the fork be effected?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:51:53
Ok so I’ll sell high and buy on the crash again
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:50:05
Did you tell her we won the war!
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:50:05
Made in 2015 and also yes it did crash but you know what it goes right back up again 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:53:26
Nice that crystal ball is pretty good there
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:23:22
So I bought 1k of bitcoin 2 hours ago (.14 bitcoin) off of Coinbase they said I won’t see it in my Coinbase wallet until the 14th. Do y’all guys think I’ll be ok with the fork coming up. I’m completely new to this and just decided to take a leap of faith what do y’all think do I keep it in my Coinbase wallet or transfer out into my Blockchain wallet so I make sure to get the fork?
@_date: 2018-03-04 06:43:49
*laughed so fucking hard*, lmao this was amazing.
