I guess we have to say more clearly that any buy offers for the moment being are being repplied on the base of our BTC Pool of 1000 available for initial buy orders on exchange. We dont believe in fake bots as such, understand it does take longer time to raise traffic, however, we show the real thing and not an exchange with lots of bots. Basically you are able right now to place a buy offer below present market price and most probably get a confirmed sell offer from admin btc pool, as long as buy offer is reasonable. In any case your comments are appreciated. Thanks

Indeed, and why not share the good stuff with the rest of the world?

What a strange comment. Don't you have anything else to do than putting down stuff you obviously don't know about. Or maybe you dont like making money? Either way your comment is not appreciated, but if you want to test the sincerity and truth in this, why not just go to CCEDK.com to register and try it out!

Thanks have changed accordingly. Nice comments, appreciated

Guess we all really have to start from 0, so I am fine with building the volume on the base of good projects, media liking what we do, and ourselvees believing in step by step attracting traffic. This could well be a game changer for us, ccombined with the soon to come free deposit of fiat in both EUR, USD and CNY. It's only just begun, I believe a great song started with.....

I have no problem with your questions, you are welcome to even come visit me her ein Denmark and we have a cup of coffee and talk things over, or even speak with me on skype, I could give you this adress if you contact me by e-mail first on ronny but bottom line is I am not hiding from you or your questions, and would be happy to answer. So if you are blocked you need to ask moderators I guess, because I have not been involved whatsoever. I only tried to answer your questions, and later I had more time, so I could speak a little less stressed. Me too I would love to know why you are blocked from other thread, and how you are able to put questions here if blocked on other could be nice to know also, but please find out and let me know. I dont have anything to do with it, and would never block anyone, unless ofcourse I feel there is a constant negativity without reason, but as I said in your first thread, I apologized and have tried to answer you since.
Dont even know how to block anyone, as I dont believe in this kind.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:20:22
Dont know how you could get blocked. It is definitely not by me. You are entitled to have your own opinion, and I already told you I apologized with a short time to answer, and did in fact answer you afterwards, so why keep up this way? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:16:00
I am sorry what are you talking about. I know I have answered you in another thread, and have not blocked you, why should I. I dont have anything against you or any points you have, so why this hostile attitude?
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:23:37
I mean I am reposting only because the prvious ones was deleted. I figured it was because too close to eachother in head title, so i changed this, as body is definitely deifferent fom eachother all depending on what message I wanted to bring to each language and forum of people.

so you mean, it is not new news if posted on diffrent sub reddits? if so what could I do to make it right and to not make it seem a I am spamming a such. I am only trying to reach three diffrent gourp of people?

Did you not read the text connected to this thread? It tells you the diffrence from other bitcoin debit cards connected to Mastercard as they are all prepaid card with what that implies is mentioned as well.
Unlike any other bitcoin cards available, BTC funds are taken directly from user wallet on exchange at the exact moment payment or cash is needed, not before, and not after! No need to fund it manually (meaning you won't lose money due to the volatile exchange rate).
Additionally, many of these other prepaid services have lower exchange rates for deposits, meaning you'll receive less value for your BTC than using this new innovative card.

@_date: 2015-05-24 21:17:04
Thank you for making it clear. Now perhaps you could give as much attention to Bitstamp, Bter, Bitfinex as well, as it seems you have used up your allowed quota on one specific topic without becoming personal. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:43:32
I do apologize abitup, no harm intended. Was on the road, simply trying to give you a quick answer. Sorry you feel like that.

Stop this now. U speak so much about hostility etc., and untill now you are the only one spreading hostile words towards CCEDK and myself, it has to stop now. If you have nothing to contribute with in terms of constructive comments, then stop following.

It is The world’s first debit card by international monetary system MasterCard™ supported with crypto currency.
CCEDK has come up with a game-changer in the bitcoin world: a Bitcoin Debit NanoCard that doesn’t just accept bitcoin transfers, but that is linked to an exchange account and enables users to spend their online bitcoin balance. It is a service with huge potential to disrupt the money transfer industry thanks to the low fees and real-time nature of transactions.
Unlike a prepaid card, balances will be available in Dollars or Euros and funded instantly by the crypto balance of each customer.
Pls have a look at our webpage:  for more information where it will also give you link with all info re. limits and fees.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:06:26
Hello dumb_dodo,
Well, if you speak about their new card it is still in its early beta stages, and not all people requesting the card receives it, and I would say that's the main difference.
Secondly, with the Nanocard you can have a balance in several currencies (Bit-X might be the only one and as such also soon CCEDK to be able to offer this).
In regards to fees and commission they change step by step. The Fee charged initially for ATM withdrawal as btc 0.02 has for instance just been changed to 0.01. This is very new information, so it will only be adjusted on our commission table tomorrow, but you will know it here tonight.
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:31:34
I suggest you read the page about limits and commissions mentioned on  with any potential fees etc, and you will notice that once you have activated the card, there are various ways a possible income would be generated. With the monthly fee waivered it makes the overall costs less, there are still some left all depending on how it is used and where.
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:25:42
It was not me who showed it as deleted. It must have been someone of the moderators, so because it showed as deleted to people opening the link on twitter, I deleted the post and made a new one, and thought this was more correct.
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:07:17
Yes, its bad really on the day of the article, but it its back up I am promised latest tomorrow Tuesday. It too a bit longer than expected to go through the renewal procedures.
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:33:34
dont forget this is a mastercard with 
FREE MONTHLY FEE - "FOR LIFE"
and will have no cost untill you decide to activate it on any of the exchanges set up for this card, for the moment being only CCEDK.com and Bit-x.com
so you loose nothing ordering it, and it might come handy later on in case of a sudden need for fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:58:25
What could be nice also, is if you found out what is wrong before starting to accuse me of whichever, I think thats not nice at all, and hope you will realize that as well sometime, soon I hope, as I dont like to be accused of any of the things you are saying, and consider it for now only you being frustrated of not feeling you get answered, which I can accept. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:08:42
This is an exchange inviting all currencies to join in general, however, since a good amount of purchases are done on the base of bitcoin, and since BTC is traded increasingly on platform via the many bitcoin markets, and since the monthly buyback on both OBITS as well as BTSR  is done partly in bitcoin I think it has all the reason for being posted on a bitcoin thread.
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:48:09
I have nothing whatsoever to do with Paycoin, Nubits on the other hand has done some nice support of CCEDK in the past, and it seems they are starting to do so once again.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:36:16
Will have to get back with you on that question. Interesting question requiring some digging, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:37:27
Yes, well it seems you are focusing more on the failures than the positive, since you dont write about CCEDK taking action on the previous months' bad experiences, introducing completely new platform to top the sucurity and in the same time offer users better choices. 
Unlike any of these bigger exchanges ALL users except one had no problems getting their funds out and even the one user touched has an amount remaining of some USD 33000 with arrangement to be settled in coming month and more than 51000 was returned shortly after. 
Whatever the amount hacked we managed to cover almost all losses, for which we got no credit, fair enough. We thought we could solve it on our own like any normal real world company would do, and we have learned our lesson. 
We care about our users, and are still young as a company and learn on the way, unlike the bigger exchanges who seems to have made a business of getting hacked every once in a while! 
And how do you know Bter and Bitstamp did not keep it a secret for months? 
When the amounts get so big you cant seem to find any way to solve it yourself, what do you do? You bring it out to the media and try to get back up best way possible. That is what these bigger exchanges seem to have done, untill an audit report is presented to prove it otherwise. 
We tried to solve the matters ourselves, and got punished for it, as it seems people prefer to rather have lost money than to close their eyes and think you are are safe and you are not, well, that is fair enough, and we have definitely learned from this the hard way. 
Your attack seem of personal nature, and that just does not seem fair. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:39:34
I Think you should Go back to focusing on your obvious own interests under bitcoin norway. You and your moderator friend just keep coming up with slander trying make all things look bad. Well maybe we should start taking a closer look at you and your friend both from norway, acting as you own reddit. I dont have time nor interest in discussing with someone WHO is obviously not interested in creating anything positive.
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:44:40
Hello allgoodthings1, thanks for taking your time commenting here.
Yes your hard earned bitcoin will only be spent and converted into fiat the moment you make a transaction, thats the beauty of this card, or at least one of them.
Pls have a look at our webpage:  for more information where it will also give you link with all info re. limits and fees. Cards is available to all states as mentioned on that list, residents do have the option to raise to level 2 for the time being at least.

What is your affiliation to paycoin / GAW / Mr. Garza, is there a relation? Might I ask why you have moved from promoting NuBits and supporting services, into a Bitcoin / ALT exchange and Bitocin debit card. Just a few questions for a financial service, I hope you don't mind I might have a few more.

I believe the fact that balances will be available in Dollars or Euros will allow Mastercard to enter not only as a payment system but also as an intenational monetary system covering to begin with two currencies in this case EUR and USD, but eventually also other currencies like CNY and GBP.
If you have some article or information saying the opposite, I will be happy to revise the text, just let me know. This is information I have been given from a party I expect to know what he is writing about, but have no problem taking it up with him, if you can tell me its a wrong way of presenting this. Thanks for your interest.

All fees are mentioned on the list with fees and limits on the nanocard webpage on ccedk.
For anyone ordering incl. US citizens, the limit is 300 on POS buys, and 300 on atm withdrawals, so totally 600 USD available for anyone using this as a travel card. US citizens are unfortunately not among the rest of the world able to validate yourself to increase the limits.
1% on POS and 3% on Withdrawals are issuer imposed fees. A small flatfeee per transaction is charged by CCEDK or Bit-x.
Right now, Incativity fee can be waivered by leaving equivalent to 5 btc valueon exchange. Sure, if you dont want to leave your funds on centralized exchange, dont activate yet, but wait untill CCEDK will become a combined wallet, exchange and vault with multisig accounts etc., and you will have no problem leaving this amount on account, as it would be your own wallet, and only you with access placed on blockchain.
Anyone ordering before we reach 10000 registrars of card will have their monthly fee 0,02 btc waivered for Life/free for for life. With it comes a future use for not only bitcoin, but all the other cryptos added with time.
