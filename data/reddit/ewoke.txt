There's a huge difference, gold is tangible and has multiple uses besides store of value. Bitcoin is just 1s and 0s.

"dip" 
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:55:06
How much was it worth in December 2017?
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:01:28
All the sane people left in 2017
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:48:49
A 90% drop in $30 isn't he same as a drop in $19k
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:35:43
1 month doesn't mean anything
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:56:48
Past performance doesn't predict future performance
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:34:14
They need to ask that to monitor for illegal transactions
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:38:31
In the first one you lose $28 and in the second one $13k, this is basic math
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:44:00
OP actually believes this
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:52:48
Ok, now zoom in to the 1 yr chart
@_date: 2019-02-08 05:13:30
This is ironic considering Jesus got crucified at the end 
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:06:53
The difference is that these inventions did something useful
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:15:53
Past performance doesn't predict future performance 
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:50:47
The only real bottom is 0
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:47:51
That means buying before the price skyrockets (2017)  not as it's crashing
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:10:36
Now click on the 1 month tab 
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:55:13
I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:46:33
Because people don't care anymore about what Satoshi wanted they just want to get rich quick 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:50:28
It's still a pseudo government, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:40:09
Why would you buy now wtf
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:30
That money is gone 
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:14:10
$100 maybe, but definitely not $100k 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:53:10
Geniuses buying the "dip" 
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:42:03
Typical crypto "investor", knows nothing about economics 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:42
Why are you down voting him? He's right, Bitcoin is built with Blockchain, Bitcoin isn't Blockchain
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:53:03
You gotta love the rationalization
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:23:17
Blockchain would be the equivalent of the Internet, not Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:44:08
It never was
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:09:13
A random Redditor knows more about economics than an ex IMF economist ��
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:13:55
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:32:25
BLOCKCHAIN not Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:50:03
What fundamentals lmao
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:41:19
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:03:47
How is it going to become a payment method of people are HODLing like crazy?
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:16:41
It's impossible to assess the price of ANYTHING
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:41:29
Do research on why you can't print computer programs? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:15:14
And those institutions are going to ask for interests, etc, right? So you end up with banks anyway 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:59
An almost 60% drop in less than a month is definitely a crash
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:08:31
Good investments aren't supposed to be "fun" 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:51:17
That's complete bs, people are just guessing, there's no way to know what the price will be
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:46
This was more like an abortion
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:45
Warren Buffett also said Bitcoin is a shit investment
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:16:59
Bitcoin can't be "printed" but you can create your own Cryptocurrency which is worst, it's like if any person could make their own version of the dollar 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:39:21
Wasn't the whole point of Bitcoin to bypass bank transaction fees?
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:19:24
What the fuck are you talking about, everyone can make their own crypto
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:47:07
Margin accounts exist
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:48:14
I like Blockchain not Bitcoin, and I prefer stocks over crypto because they have actual intrinsic value 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:49:19
If you day trade then fees are a problem, if you invest correctly fees shouldn't be an issue
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:08:51
If you base your financial decisions on what people tweet you shouldn't be investing 
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:32:33
Because gold isn't aiming to be a currency, really idiotic response.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:47:53
Ok, keep living in denial
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:00:01
This post is so economically illiterate
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:03:56
Wow, it's almost as if deflationary currencies didn't for ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:28:48
It did lmfao
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:37:22
Stop spreading FUD!!!!1!  /s
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:42:02


Except you can fork it indefinitely 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:40:09
Only because it came first
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:35:16
The dollar didn't shut down, this is a stupid analogy
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:30:09
If people don't use it as a currency like intended, then it will become worthless. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:22:00


No, it's not. The price hasn't floored yet
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:44:46
People are in denial right now
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:21:18


He also said: 
"In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending".
"If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth."
Idk why people keep quoting someone who called Bitcoin rat poison
