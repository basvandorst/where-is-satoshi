I bet that dude bought that super sweet fanny pack with bitcoin.

They'll actually know long before that day.  It's already begun.

For the future of bitcoin, it's best to use the bitcoins you buy.  If everyone was just buying them up and sitting on them as an investment instead of perpetuating their spread and value by using them to purchasing goods, it will kill the future of bitcoin.

Could also be a high number of BTC being "mixed" a few times or a mixer testing a new process.

My point was actually that Apple doesn't belong in an Enterprise environment.

Have you logged into your account from a public machine or from your laptop IN public?  Snapping a pic of your screen while the API key is up would be pretty easy to use that in the future.  As a security expert, I can tell you that more often than not, the physics are compromised...  I.E. over-the-shoulder password lifting, snapping a pic of your screen at a coffee shop or any public area, post-it with your password under the keyboard.  Beyond that comes keyloggers, packet cap's, trojans, etc, and so-on.

Sooooo..  Basically a variation of cole slaw.

It's all glitz and glamour.  I knew when the advertisements for the iPhone5 were centered around a pair of headphones, having nothing to do with the phone, that even they knew they had nothing else to offer except more CPU and Memory.
It's common knowledge that the iPhone4 was the last mobile device Apple released as an acceptable upgrade from the last model.  Since then, Apple has lost market share every quarter.  And it continues today.
If that's not enough, it's a well-known fact that Apple, by design, cripples old devices to push users into upgrading.

That article is an intellectual parallel of a Michael Moore rant.  I scoured that damn page for a comment or feedback link for a few mins (mobile version at least) to no avail :(

FYI - Apple has always catered to the "Ease of use" factor.  They have NEVER been even somewhat decent at anything above the norm.  They're wonderful for graphics design, web browsing, email, and word processing.  That's about it.  Apple fan-boys are people who have never needed to push past that.  Everything outside of that scope is harshly managed by Apple.

How about someone say HOW MUCH they were PAID for HOW MUCH work put in...  Invaluable information for anyone except the three of you actually using it...  :/

True.  And this is exactly why I'm buying an Android device.  To do what Apple refuses do - allow BTC apps.

He may, possibly, just have a little fiat to burn.

As a computer technician, do you check to see if Windows is licensed before doing any work on a user's home PC?  Would you even know?
Probably not without a popup.
Unnecessary details.  They're just doing their job.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:28:06
True.  And I'm about to purchase a new Android for mobile BTC usage.
