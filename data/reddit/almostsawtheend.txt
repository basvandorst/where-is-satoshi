People have already mentioned change, which is your issue/problem.  But to break it down so that you understand what happened:
When you sent that .2 to bitcoinbuilder, it used the "*2.214839 deposit from 2013*" that you mentioned, to send it..
You then got change back from that transaction, to a change address(which is now in your bitcoin-qt client).  Neither of the two private keys that you uploaded to your blockchain wallet involve this change address.
Just let your bitcoin-qt sync.  And then you'll see your coins.
edit/sidenote:  This is why you should always backup wallets(especially after transactions).  Not understanding how change works can lead to disaster and confusion.  Many people think that change simply comes back to their same/main address.  
**No**...  change comes back to a **brand new address** that you have never seen/used before, **every time**.

I use bitcoin to pay for VPN services, and to buy giftcards from gyft.  I've also used it to get some hardware from bitcoinstore.
Sometimes when I'm out with friends for food/drinks, they like to pay my bill or tab, and then have me give them the equivalent in btc.  Which kinda counts.
