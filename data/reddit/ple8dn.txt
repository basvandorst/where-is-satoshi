Dark energy-- the mysterious energy that is accelerating the universe's expansion to the extent that we are now moving at a speed greater than the speed of light away from other galaxies in the universe. This energy reminds me of resonance.  Like the opera singer shattering a crystal glass by singing the naturally resonant frequency of the glass (put enough energy into the glass, and it'll do the rest). Bitcoin (also somewhat shrouded in mystery) has now found its resonance, and has already reached an unstoppable momentum, with relatively so few people truly understanding it, and why it is such a game changer. Once enough energy has gone into Bitcoin, Bitcoin will do the rest.

Right on.  I'm 40, and my first computer was a Commodore 64. I remember how stoked my Dad was to get that thing.  2nd computer was a Pac-Bell 486 w/ 300Mb hard drive, which let me dial up BBS services. It was so epic at the time! But kids these days... my son learned how to "swipe to unlock" when he was 2, and and that technology is just about outdated already... Makes me realize that change is happening now quicker than we ever knew as kids.  I love it.  He has a silver dollar collection, $2 bill collection, and just wants to have a little piece of BTC as well. It's all interesting to him.  Some people have really been showing their personal fear of change and doubt on here. Like if a 10yr old kid wants to own some BTC his parents are doing something seriously wrong, or faking it, whatever.  Really blows my mind. Really appreciate your comment though.

You continue to say “forever”, but this has no bearing on whether all the “inactive” coins you reintroduce (steal) actually belong to someone, or whether that someone has passed the keys along to children, grandchildren, etc... it would upend the blockchain, cast doubt on the technology, and ruin BTC altogether.

Geez, well, putting a 1-year timeline on Bitcoin with the expectation that it will be higher than it is today (to put an arbitrary number on it, let's say-- 12k to 15k a year from now), and most likely not seeing declines below $7600 - $8000... that would make their $8.5k purchase essentially a bottom.  I think it's at least somewhat fair to say that a purchase at $8.5 a few days ago, with a subsequent drop to $8.2k isn't much to fret over in a year's time.

I don't quite understand the OPs suggestion, given that Bitcoin is truly stronger than ever. But I think the only Libra hope for crypto-types like us would be that the overall idea of digital assets becomes more mainstream, therefor shedding more light on Bitcoin and opening peoples' minds to it (ie it's not accurate to look at it as a simply a vehicle for illicit activity) .  This, in effect, could be seen as positive for Bitcoin. Obviously FB and Libra are a piece of shit though.

Not sure what the difference between your account and mine, but I don't receive the 'funds on hold' status. I am based in U.S. but not sure if that matters. To test the method I used an amount of $250.  It deposited to Coinbase app from linked bank acct immediately (BofA), and the transfer to Coinbase Pro was also immediate, and funds were available to purchase BTC.  After purchase, I immediately transferred to Ledger, and it all worked.  I am curious why it doesn't work for others. Only variable I can think of is linked/unlinked account.
EDIT: just saw that your acct is linked, so obviously it's something else.  Acct history/ total Coinbase transactions? No idea.

@_date: 2019-08-21 16:26:09
I literally just tried this and it worked. I'm actually kinda blown away by it, considering I've been buying thru Coinbase app for a few years now. I think the key is to have a linked bank account in Coinbase app so that your USD deposit there immediately.  I have 2 accts that I've used w/ Coinbase app, but only 1 of them says 'linked'.  the other says 'unlinked', which I assume would require a waiting period before the USD transferred over. Everything went exactly as u/The-Patronizer just described.

Can you transfer out of Robinhood to a cold storage wallet? If the answer is ‘no’ then I wouldn’t touch it.  Anything that allows you to transfer your Bitcoin elsewhere would be a better bet. I started with Coinbase, and still use it (tbh I don’t even care about the fees). But I always move my Bitcoin to cold storage afterward. Only downside is that you have to wait a few days until you can actually withdrawal it.

Can you explain real quick how the government doesn't represent you? If you live in the U.S., then the U.S. government represents you, sorry to say.  The original colonies revolted against England-- they were paying taxes back to England, and in turn England was doing nothing for them.  We may disagree with -how- the U.S. government represents us and blows our money, but the answer to that is not to simply quit paying your taxes.

On the philosophy of ‘taxation is theft’.. I totally get the sentiment, as I don’t like being taxed, but an honest question I have is: what happens to all the necessary and legitimate uses of tax money? i.e. roads, traffic lights, infrastructure (the societal things that we all need to use, and therefor pay for), but also social programs that help abandoned kids, domestic abuse victims, public schools, etc.  Is the idea that these would be better served if all of these sectors were privatized, and no taxes were paid by anyone? Or would everything crumble? I’m genuinely looking for the anti-tax paying point of view.

what you really need to know
\-Cash is a fiat currency
\-It's traded between people, with the help of banks, at an annual cost of $163 billion in fees and interest
\-Every transaction is tracked by the banks, who then sell data to large corporations for the purpose of marketing goods and services to people
\-Cash is created by the governments who print as much as they deem necessary, hence de-valuing the existing cash that its citizens earn and save with the hope of retiring one day
\-Cash is printed easily with a special printer
\-Cash can be traded anonymously, which makes it a popular way of funding illegal activities
\-A single dollar is worth a single dollar today, and the value is guaranteed to decrease over time
\-The US dollar is one of many fiat currencies, but by far the most popular.

If you're concerned about this, you should not buy BTC.

Not undefined, as there will always be the Satoshi, which is technically defined (better than any fiat currency is defined). But your point is powerful, and it's quite exciting to think that one day people will look back on these times and say, "Can you believe that societies once used paper notes that the governments printed to no end..."

My guess is upward to 10k.  I think that the pump we saw this year was market manipulation by whales, knowing confidently that Bakkt would release, and the higher they pumped the price, the more they'd be able to short after Bakkt Launch-- hence the drop to 8k.  They played into the Bakkt hype, and pulled the rug out from under it.  This is only a guess, but it's how I've been attempting to rationalize the drop.  Now (fingers crossed) that we've found some support here, we'll move upward.  But it'll be slow.

As hard as it may be, putting your focus on something entirely different while recouping your losses will be best for you. I do realize how difficult this is, as personally being someone who constantly looks at the price. Keep earning a living doing whatever your occupation may be, focus on hobbies, go camping or do something in which you have no use for your phone or computer. Eventually when your bank account is back to where it previously was, you’ll have an easier time looking at the money you lost as a valuable lesson. Then dip your toe back in. Anyone, including myself, who currently holds bitcoin is “losing” money right now (unrealized losses, even though we’re not selling), but we can always maintain our strength and confidence by reminding ourselves that we ultimately believe in the incredible power of this technology— something even the worst FUD and market fluctuations can’t take away.

Just a bit of performance anxiety. Bitcoin will rise to the occasion.
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:17:38
I thought you meant “just getting started” as in: we started off the year at $3500 and now we’re at $10k, and we’re “just getting started”. But then I saw that funny little emoji, and realized that you’re most likely a little bitter because you either a) failed to load up your bags at an insanely low price earlier this year, or b) you loaded up your bags at 13k in late June, and don’t have any more money to buy the dips at this point. Either way, best of luck.

There is absolutely no difference between the investing methods in the 2 examples you gave, aside from the investment amounts. They are both DCA.

Most of us know how you feel, even if we didn’t liquidate.  Most of us have FOMO’d at some point before a big drop. Accept your mistake and move on. And avoid the mistake next time around.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:48:58
This is definitely worthy of consideration.

I’m with you for the most part diydude2... But I think we should avoid speaking absolutes, because it gives all the troll types ammunition for their petty ‘I told you so’ arguments. The important fact is that Bitcoin is incredibly strong regardless of current price action, and in the bigger picture anything above 9k is healthy right now. Just look at this year’s gains for crying out loud, they’re insane. Who cares if it dips under 10k again.

I had no idea about FDR, seizure of America’s gold, and EO6102 in 1933 prior to your comment. Thanks for mentioning it. It’s not hard to make the connection to the Fed’s fear of Bitcoin (and Trump’s love affair with Executive Orders)— the biggest difference being that Bitcoin equates to free speech (by definition, being computer code). 
Source: 
TLDR: In 1933 FDR required US Citizens to forfeit their gold to the US gov’t at a price of $20.67 per Troy oz. After seizure of Americans’ gold, the fed declared the price of gold to be $35 per Troy oz (Gold Reserve Act of 1934). The gold collected was melted, cast into bars, currently resides at Ft. Knox.

I think they were calling the Fed board member "it"... which makes the statement mostly correct.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:44:16
It may be important to consider at this point in the conversation that bitcoins are "mined", rather than "printed".  While the supply of BTC is increasing (inflationary by the technical definition of total supply), it is only increasing because of demand, and \*only\* demand (whereas USD can be printed by whatever logic the Fed sees fit).  Am I correct to say that if there were no more demand for BTC, then no more BTC would be created (people would stop mining it).  As long as BTC continues to be mined, it is only because the incentive to create said BTC (demand) outweighs the supply, thus making the currency deflationary by nature.
