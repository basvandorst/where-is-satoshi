good suggestion.  let's sponsor both hackathon and hackerspaces.  both are worthy causes.
- hackerdojo  &lt;-- (most famous one i know of)  has a bitcoin atm.  
- plug &amp; play center  - not a hackerspace, but a co-working space.  hosting bitcoin meetup every week
- 20 mission   hosting bitcoin meetup every month.
- citizen space 
- berkeley coworking space

hmm... address is already the hashed form.  he said 2^160 possible addresses, not 2^256 addresses.  
however, address does go through base58 encoding to eliminate 0, O, I, and l.  so even though address is 160 bits.  the resulting possibility would not cover entire range of 2^160.

well, colored coins is on top of bitcoin, so that won't work for microtransactions if bitcoin cannot work for microtransactions.  
i was really hoping microtransactions can be a strong suit of bitcoin.  so i hope people won't introduce features that impedes microtransactions.

micropayment channels still require channel establishment and the final transactions.  it is good for metering type of transactions, but micropayment channel still requires some transactions to be placed onto blockchain.

That is the answer.  These regulation are not bare minimum.  In fact, it is extremely onerous.  I cannot believe that someone actually said those regulation sounds ok.  It basically is anti-startup and make innovation extremely difficult for startup.  It will only allow innovation from big players like established banks who are either exempted or who have the money and lawyer power to follow these.  
If we have required every website to obtain business license, most of the Internet today would not occur (this analogy does not come from me.  I am sorry that I forget who it is from).

This is a good analogy.  One that people can relate to easily.  
If there was a IntLicense or NetLicense in 1994 that regulates how people can use Internet.  There may not be Ebay, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, and countless others Internet companies.  There might not be blogs and forums.  Time, WSJ and the old information portals may still control how users receive information online.

If Australian government treats bitcoin as a good, not currency, does that mean that bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin businesses is not considered money-transmitter and is not subjected to the regulation pertain to currency.  
If that is the case, then it is actually good news.  Right now, creating a bitcoin business in US is damn difficult due to money transmitter license requirement.

thank you so much for the explanation.  that is a great explanation.  now i think i have more understanding.  the miner is still doing the same hash.  it is just the reporting that is different.  for lower difficulty settings, the miner software will report low difficulty findings to the pool.  for higher difficulty settings, the miner software will report only the high difficulty findings to the pool.

however, the second and third time i tried to do this.  bitcoind received unconfirmed transaction right away.
i was puzzled by why bitcoind did not receive the first unconfirmed transaction.

i'm trying to read about nLockTime (aka lock_time).  bitcoin wiki has a barebone 1 sentence description.
i would like to understand more about it.  sounds like you could do a lot using this feature.  
  
nLockTime is a parameter that can be attached to a transaction, that mandates a minimal time (specified in either unix time or block height), that before this time, the transaction cannot be accepted into a block.
here is a bit more info.
If all TxIn inputs have final (0xffffffff) sequence numbers then lock_time is irrelevant. Otherwise, the transaction may not be added to a block until after lock_time (see NLockTime).

You can definitely do it yourself.  
Run a bitcoind program.  Have your website talks to the bitcoind program.  
from what you are asking, sounds like you need to:
* create new address
* monitor to see that the address has the fund
you can use bitcoind to do both:
* your website can ask bitcoind to create a new unique address.
* your website can periodically ask bitcoind the balance for the address.  
i have done both and so i know it works.  
if you need more details, let me know.  
ps. i didn't read the other question you asked today, so i don't know if i'm off in interpreting your question.

good advice.  a lot of time people don't know about the 100 transactions thing.  the "changes" in a transaction is going to be placed in a new address.
@_date: 2014-08-04 21:55:41
thank you, that does clear it up.  :)
so the amount sent is irrelevant.  the important part is embedding the information in the transaction.  
the asset is not represented by a certain bitcoin output.  transaction of colored coin is by creating a new transaction with embedded information that says it is transacting certain amount of asset xyz to another address.  transaction of colored coin asset is not by simply sending the bitcoin output to another address.
hope i get that right.
on the same note, since btc amount is irrelevant, why don't people always use the smallest possible amount for colored coin transaction to minimize their cost?

1. address is derived from public key.  if you have the public key, you can easily generate your address.
2. each 1 bitcoin stays with the address (well, the actual situation is that the bitcoin stay with the output, not the address.  but for the sake of abstraction, we can just say the bitcoin stays with the address).  your wallet do not combine the bitcoin together from different addresses.  it merely report the total by adding the total from each address.
of course, we are assuming you are using wallet like bitcoin-qt or multibit.  if it is a hosted wallet like coinbase, coinbase might actually combine them.

merkle tree is a type of data structure.
you can put a bunch of data into merkle tree.  eventually, you will arrive at a merkle root.  the merkle root size should be substantially smaller than the actual data.  instead of putting the actual data in blockchain, you can place the merkle root in the blockchain as it is much small in size.  you can still prove that the merkle root represent your actual data.  
for example, bitcoin blockchain put the merkle root of the transactions data in the block header instead of putting all the transactions in the header.  block header is only 80 bytes.  it will be too small to place all transactions data into block header.

this sounds very cool.  you mentioned that this is partially based on bitcoinj.  which portion is based on bitcoinj?
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:00:05
they are not the same at all.  you won't be comparing lightning network with changetip at all because they are completely different thing.  
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:05:56
is this the fee?
- Card activation	0.05 BTC	-
- Card delivery via airmail	0.05 BTC	-
- Cash withdrawal at ATM	0.01 BTC + 3%
- Payments (POS)	0.002 BTC	+ 1%

the tx input is mised with the global utxo set?  
sounds interesting.  how does monero do that?
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:47:40
sounds like blockstream has not revealed how it will work?  leaving us to guess.  
thanks for the information and the nice example you provided.
edit: "the nice little example" instead of "the little example"

i wish to know too.  how would the system work for pos.  also, what is pob you are mentioning?
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:51:44
when people looks for ways to protect their money, they may look into diversifying into bitcoin, where government does not control it.

does this mean mit will pay gavin's salary?
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:22:49
i believe cheapair.com allow you to buy airfare with bitcoin.  perhaps expedia too.  not sure if that is what you are looking for?
@_date: 2015-04-17 06:06:38


how about involuntary ones?  ;)
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:17:49
sidechains, so it will allow us to destroy bitcoin and in term create an alt-coin that is based on the destroyed bitcoins. on the other direction, it will allow is to destroy those created alt-coin and return us the bitcoin.  is that right?
but how does it actually work under the hood?
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:30:24
thanks for the example.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:53:14
how does sidechain "lock up" the amount?
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:31:32
If you are at liberty to say, would you mind give example on the ridiculous salaries.  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-04-21 01:05:27
i appreciate the link.  
page 9-10 talks about 
"Send to SPV-locked output"
"the parent chain coins are sent to a special output on the parent
chain that can only be unlocked by an SPV proof of possession on the sidechain."
i guess my question is i'm looking for the detail about how to do that SPV proof to lock it.  Which does not seem to be described on those pages?  or i'm just missing it.  at this point, that SPV proof that locks the output seem to be just magic.  :)

can you tell me how making mining do SHA(SHA(x)+1) instead of SHA(SHA(x)) breaks asic?  
i thought at least some of these asic does sha256.  so wouldn't that just require a bit change in programming?  or does the asic actually hardwired to do sha(sha(x))?
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:21:58
thanks, but i'm ondering how does the "lock up" done technically?  by using some kind of clever script?  or by creating a new feature enforced by the protocol?  i have a little bit of understanding of bitcoin script if script is required to explain how.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:53:45
how does the pegging work?
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:02:06
I am merely suggesting one possible explanation as to why some people are expecting price movement.  That is what happened to Cyprus event before.  I'm sorry if that seem to somehow offend you?  It was not meant to be at all.  It is just an answer to an question.    
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:27:19
true.  i should use the word "lock up" rather than "destroy".  
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:31:28
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:04:09
what might be a good place to read up on how colored coin works?  thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:11:55
i'm curious too.  
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:40:50
thanks for the info
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:00:05
is there a live stream?
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:49:23
The title looks perfect.  
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:44:30
i thought microsoft also accepts bitcoin.  is t-mobile bigger or microsoft bigger?

This is a good talk.
Gavin said they will pull historical scriptsig from the blockchain so most of the nodes do not need to store those history.  Is that the right understanding from what he said?  
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:28:16
thank you for posting.  this is useful.  
i think it might be useful to have the title.  :)

wait, if this is actually true, wouldn't that be the biggest news?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:42:33
uh.  what do you mean?  sorry i haven't tracked reddit for a while is not familiar with the jargon?
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:42:39
which hidden transaction cost?  thanks.
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:40:49
I heard that boost.vc has refocused to be half cryptocurrency and half VR?  Is that still true?
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:35:17
what is the coinbase news last week?
