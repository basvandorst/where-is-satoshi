Looks like you missed that boat
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:13:41
You mean 2029, most people have just started to understand what cryptos actually are
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:17:03
The worst thing about this crash is not having any more fiat to invest with, actually

Major buy signal tbh
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:02:41
You cannot cash out on Binance.
Use Coinbase, Gemini, or Kraken
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:25:44

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:13:14
It's gone
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:04:56

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:23
Ask ur parents and get them to buy it 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:56:21
Why are you posting a poll asking about if we know what bitcoin is within the bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:43:26
There was a recent dip down to 8k so I'm not sure how far the next one will go down. You should plan on buying before CME futures Dec 18

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:04
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:35:11
Nobody will ever know when that is
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:49
Did u do a wire transfer or a bank transfer? And if yes what time? Or did u use a card?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:24:46
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:04:32
Gimmie all ur bitcoin and I'll invest it for you /s
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:56:00
Yes. Insutituational money is BIG money. The entire market cap is ~$350B valuation and is world wide. The NASDAQ alone is ~$6T and that's from the USA only. Institutional money can pump the prices up massively but you can expect a correction. Right now, it's safe to say that a $1m investment is a shit ton of money for a tiny market cap of $350B, right? For institutions, they wipe their ass with $1m. Additionally, since bitcoin is "digital gold" you can expect the market cap of bitcoin to reach at least $6T in many many years to come. Since it is a world wide store of value, a future $10T+ of the entire crypto market valuation (btc plus alt coins) is not unreasonable. Apologies for the rambling, but in conclusion, speculating that the price of btc when futures goes live is almost expected.

10/10 would bang
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:37:00
Yea that's true. Still brings general publicity for those who want to hold some bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:27
5-7 business days
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:06

@_date: 2017-12-02 19:39:47
If bitcoin reaches $1m I'll buy everyone a pizza with my bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:28:55
I like binance
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:33
Lightning network will solve this issue. Also, treat it as a store of value for now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:42:34
And altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:57:32
Just say you lost the money and store your coins into a nano ledger and write it off as a loss lmao
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:59:06
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:06
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:55:24
I don't think that is possible lol
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:32:25
It won't
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:22:32
4th quarter BTC can be pushed down to $5k because people expect a bull run. It won't happen
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:29:20
Who knows
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:23:45
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:45:10

Check your own GDAX account and sign in using your coinbase details. If you don't see any bitcoin in there, it's gone forever:(
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:34:07
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:37:02
Lying is never okay. But if you can hold off for a year or two your btc value will be greater and your future self will thank you
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:23:05
As big as my dick huge like really big
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:27
Wish I could buy the dip but I'm out of funds! lmao
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:18:35
Yes, always
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:53:17
Some of those gdax websites are actually masked phishing scams
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:01:25

Nah only if you withdraw a million or more. IRS won't give a fuck about $300. They have more important things to do.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:49:54
I'm going to be real with you here. It could all be a bubble and nobody will ever know. Never forget that. Everything could be nothing tomorrow. Again, nobody will ever know.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:34:51
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:00:23
Everyone sell!
So I can buy more!
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:04:32
To the top!
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:39:49
Yup 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:25:45
Gimme gimme free Lambos
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:20:22
I'd wait until tomorrow night. BTC should dip to 7850-7900
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:23:51
I'd buy more but I'm out of funds lmfao
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:38:51
Wow, great work! Congratulate your dad for such a great painting. Is he involved in bitcoin? If he isn't you should get him to be. Gotta drive those prices up lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:18
The money gets placed in the exchange as USD instead of BTC. If you want to cash out for fiat, you would do that on CoinBase. The exchange (GDAX) is linked with CoinBase.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:29:15
Bitcoin.com is a scam. Bitcoin.org is the official site. Coinbase.com makes buying Bitcoin very easy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:54:14
