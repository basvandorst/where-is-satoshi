You need actual proof mastercard is attacking bitcoin before any of this. 
One "contributor" on forbes (who isn't staff) making opinions isn't any cause for concern.
On the other hand, maybe getting people like Fenton, Winklvii, Rose (Kevin rose), Kelso, and the other public/likable faces to start finding ways of lobbying would be a good idea.
er I meant ashton kutcher.
Remember, showing solutions is better than just stating the obvious.

eh, you just want attention like some kind of man baby. If I'm going to spend any time arguing with someone, over something they have no place to stand, I need to at least think they can rival me. you are just a constipated delusional schizo, who's completely full of shit.

At this point in time one would only need KNC and Ghash to begin any hardforks. The other 34ish% (that need to get over their differences and become 1) would be forced to update in order to stay "involved".

security is most important, everything else can be/should be delegated by such worker.
If it's a small business, one person can handle it and offload the work to a service.
If it's a large business, you will not only need a department, you will also need to do a bit of restructuring, implement policy and it's very important to thoroughly update your CSR training so they can at minimum look through the block chain to find the TX before escalating, they will be dealing with people who don't know what they are doing, and expect them to know what they are doing.

but how do you get the free 0.01BTC? OP said to play the contests to get the bonus but OP didn't elaborate what we win, or what the bonus is, or how to withdraw or who even won and what they won. Was this just free to play, and not actually free and is free?

better to just go through vircurex, so you can use paypal.
localbitcoins and mycellium involves meeting shady characters and paying 20%-50% markup. 
vircurex is about 25% markup but you don't have to deal with those shady characters. they do however hold your coins for 24 hours tho, but at least you don't have to take a chance on some guy that more than likely faked his reputation.
If you don't believe me, look through localbitcoins forum. it's 85% scam accusations. All those charact6ers are now on mycellium.

It was a good opportunity to insult him. In fact, I think people should insult his intelligence more, as he clearly has delusions of eloquence. Honestly, I think he's probably a babyboomer jew, I've met many jews that argue like him with no substance just looking for attention and love reading their own words. 
I'd probably insult you also for asking me to answer his ill-equipped conjecture, but I'd rather do other things.

I honestly hate the way changetip works. I have so many accounts that now I have to figure out how to send tips... to myself! Of course it doesn't matter though because I can't even send them IRL.

No problem dude, just be really fucking careful, I use the expletive with the utmost seriousness. I watched some chick get ripped off for $100 by a highly repped person with 10K in business dealings because she was using paypal. Just because the high rep person thought she was a well known scammer. In the end, they both got their paypal accounts locked, and the girl -$100
@_date: 2014-05-04 13:09:54
Hi, I just signed up and made a listing, but it's not showing up. It's the one for coinbase.
BTW, I know several that are not listed that I trust and don't trust, that I could offer my reviews on if you liked the one I did on coinbase.
This is the sort of thing we really need to use for directing new people. I've been ripped off a few times by bitcoin people that I actually know the real names of. So I'm pretty adamant about making people well aware of how much crime happens in bitcoinland, so they can be safe.  I saw gox coming from a year away, and the actual reason why so many people lost all of their fortunes was because of the blind parroting that happens around here. People for some reason, trust the recommendations from the hive mind, which is highly fallible.
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:34:04
If you aren't a scammer, then you are going to get scammed, I guarantee it.
Only way to use paypal with bitcoin is through vircurex and getting gouged from taking fees from doing a bunch of conversions.
BTW, there are people here who will scam you, just for the simple fact you are trying to use paypal. Seriously, they can even get your account locked. You need to use something else or take the gouging and wait the 48 hours with vircurex.

no dude, it's Satoshis, QUBITS and bitcoins!!!
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:52:29
*It shouldn't need a detailed description.* that is the entire point. 
a 5 dollar bill is 5 dollars, or 5 hundred pennies. 25 cents is 25 pennies. we don't need bitcoin denominated in these odd expressions, all we need are satoshis and bitcoins that's it. We need nothing else. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible but the hard limit is 8 places. Therefore we have 21 quadrillion units aka satoshis. I have been around since before they started this nonsense and it keeps changing, and it's still retarded.
I don't know if you and the others are realizing it or not, but using mbtc and ubtc is confusing the shit out of people. 
It's like going around telling people you have 67 halves of 430 dollars! Now based on that, do you have any idea whatsoever a halve is equaling in that statement?

Have you noticed how most of these guys making shit up don't even seem to care that they don't make sense? Like this whole idea of having 0.01 change... wtf??? retarded IYAM. it costs at least a thousand satoshis to make a TX. so I wonder, why exactly do we need 0.01 change? They just think up more and more contrived ideas on how to confuse people. Doing the exact opposite of what it's supposed to be doing.
Satoshis and Bitcoins, that's all we need.
