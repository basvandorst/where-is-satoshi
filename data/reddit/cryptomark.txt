Whatever value BCC will have it'll have to be drained from BTC. So if you dump BCC to buy BTC you end up with the same money minus fees.
Amazing. People still think there'll be some kind of  magical free money. Of course, because that's how life works. Free money all the time.

I'd buy 3 if it was turtle-neck and brown.

I believe this as much as I believe in her talent.

I rather go with a market where most ICOs stand for businesses that will prosper (yes, some won't) than believe in "free money" falling in our pockets just because. It amazes me how people actually believe in that. Gonna be the greatest bull trap of our time.

I'm buying when it drops to 2000€

Quick writing, poorly explained idea. I mean i still expect the price to go back up from now to beginning of August. That should make for some profit.

Today on things that never happened. You're just someone trying to discredit crypto. Bears are out and they're f cking hungry!

Thanks for the info. By the way, i'd assume the one on the new chain would hold most of the value. If it happens, i think i'll sell the old and keep the new one. But you never know which way things turn, so better wait and see.

Hopefully someone will answer these questions.

We need crypto debit cards for every currency.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:09:17
Thanks for the info. I'll keep an eye on my wallet provider and how they plan on doing it.

That's what i did today. Whatever goes now, goes. But the way is up, we all know it. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

Open an account with mobile bank N26. It's german, and after the video ID procedures (which take 5 minutes) and setting up your account, you'll get a mastercard in the mail which you can use anywhere.
Use SEPA to transfer from Kraken to that account and go about happily spending.
I've been using it and already did SEPA transfers without any fees attached.

In simple terms, does it mean that my wallet will still show BTC? Or will it show 1/2 BTC Classic and the other 1/2 BTC New? Sorry for the newbie questions.

I did my move today. It will pay off sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:08:38
I saw the horizon and went for it. So far is paying off.

SEPA to Kraken -&gt; buy bitcoin. There. Easy.
