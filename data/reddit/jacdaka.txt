Well, I'm in Germany at least most of them are not educated.
The most ones can't even read and then they should learn German quick.
The ones who have higher education don't seem to have the same standard. I heard that they are taking those "doctors" and force the staff to accept them like they are, even trough they are making their job wrong.
I know which clinics to avoid.
Then you have the problem that many of them lie about who they are and especially their age.
Then you should not forget that most crimes in Germany are made by them, and also most people who rely on welfare, also don't originate from Germany.
I grew up with people from a lot of different Nations, in the lower German school classes (lower school form), 25 of 30 kids are not German.
But they where born here and grew up, they where German in their head.
Most people from outside don't even like Germans, but want to live in Germany for work out a better life.
Like my polish flatmate, who lives in Germany since more than 8 years but still can't speak German at all.
Or the grandmother of a Kurdish friend, who always needs someone, because she still can't speak German, after  more than 40 years of living in Germany from wellfare.
But we rely to import humans, as we don't produce enough on our own to maintain our industry.
I like the vision of a multikulti too
Who would do the dirty work, if not the uneducated and poor ?
