sorry, but I see it as a store of value. It is currently a terrible transaction currency unless you are going cross border. I think the transactions features it will improve over time. I am not going to be selling or spending much bitcoin at all for a while....I can promise you that. We need better apps, lower transaction costs and quicker confirmations for this to be a transaction currency.
It is a good store of value because of the transparent and widely understood monetary policy. Many people in the world advocate for 2% inflation as a "ideal" target. Many people who like bitcoin argue that minimal or zero currency creation is a better monetary policy. People who don't thinking a constantly inflating currency is good finally have a choice and we are putting our investments where our minds lead us.

also would not be surprised if some combination of solutions for this problem don't be come a very high growth business in the future.
bitcoin tumbler- Monero - Zcash....some combinations of these will start being used by people with medium sized capital gains.

yes....you are supposed to. Government is like honey badger...doesn't give a shit...it just wants your money. They do the same thing to my commodity futures trades...that is how taxes work....of course....don't sell your btc for USD and you have no problem

Not nervous at all... a 60% crash would be welcome. A 60% rally could happen as well...why be nervous? I want to accumulate more btc over next couple years...not too worried about the dollar value

jimythetulip....your statement is true and I appreciate you being balanced.

The value is that it won't need bailouts from a corrupt government. It is a way to hold and protect some value in your currency even if the government decides to print 10x the currency that previously existed.

seriously, can you pleased provide more details about the demographic of your mom and her friends?
I am a 44 year old guy with 3 kids. Is your mom like my age and does she have a degree in economics or computer science.....or is she like 63 years old and sells cat crafts on etsy?

can buy big quantities at local bitcoin....dealers/market makers have been building up their business with that.

JP Morgan Traders on reddit/bitcoin feel free to check-in. Obviously you know you work for the dark lords but are smart enough to see where the growth opportunities are. How long will be people at the top of the pyramid be able to keep up the centralized fiat currency scam known as the USD? everyone needs a exit plan

yes this was this summer...It wasn't actually that complicated...I am just basically dumb/slow at adapting new technology...even though I went to MIT.

I am not in favor of police beating peaceful old ladies. That is all I need to know. Spain and EU government is not peaceful.

I think hard money with debt Jubilee's once every 57 years works best.
Deflation is good because it rewards the people who can live within their means and punishes the extravagent wastefulness and consumerism.
Inflation has some good points too..it isn't all black and white...the worst thing I see today financially is the old people who have properties (or any good assets) in areas with real jobs are happy collaborate to inflate the asset prices because they were there first. Young ppl have no way of getting in without going into debt up to eyeballs...banks and boomers all love this and it is at the expense of younger generation or those in young generation who don't inherit wealth.
Bitcoin is threatening to break into that monopoly by tearing down that banker/boomer racket they have goin on the poor and young of the world.

I also think there is pyramid scheme Aspect. I am in favor of bitcoin and think it is a better more fair pyramid scheme than than the government run currencies. The first in on this pyramid scheme can make a lot of money...the last in won’t make as much.  Don’t be last.

There are good traits and bad traits of ponzi schemes. The bad traits are obvious. The good trait is that those in early enough can make a lot of money if they get out at right time.
So I agree that bitcoin has some of the traits of a ponzi scheme...those in early are making a lot of money. I am not seeing the false promises of "guaranteed income" or "guaranteed returns on money" though. It is all definitely a high risk investment/scheme/network etc. 
It is already guaranteed that Amazon will eventually accept cryptocurrency...when that happens they will also be in the business of managing crypto-currency risk...does that really "worry" you? or were you just talking about some other analysts?
I am glad for you to have a good job at a bank! I wish you more prosperity and love.

the only violence involved here is nationalist socialist spanish soldiers beating Catalonians

I think you are both correct. Tyrants love to use a corrupted institution of any kind...all the world s great religions have helped create institutions that are then corrupted and used by tyrants...just as tyrants will try to corrupt and utilize cryptocurrencies in the future and they rigged/corrupted precious metals markets in the past.
Life is not black and white. It is healthy to recognize this stuff and not make a lot of blanket statements if you can...we are all trying to understand the world...I think most in this space are pretty intelligent.

True ...the spainish militaristic attitude towards peaceful independence movement is nationalist at it’s core.

I buy every two weeks. When I get paycheck....I buy a bigger $ amount when it is a dip.

Mutual funds are scams and millennials are not gullible enough to get tricked into putting their savings into funding baby boomer retirements again. We already see how the pension scam and SS are being foisted on us.
