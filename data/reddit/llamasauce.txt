What if it's a bright cold day in April and the clock's striking thirteen?

People are making less today, adjusting for inflation, and jobs are fewer. Yeah, we saved the banks so they *never* go out of business--in fact, they can even commit fraud with impunity.
Sure, my account balance hasn't ever vanished overnight, but my bank charges me a fee if I have less than a certain amount of money in my account. They can borrow at a nearly 0% interest rate to save their business (thanks Big Ben!), but I'm still struggling with student loans and can't even declare bankruptcy to avoid them, let alone enjoy a near-zero interest rate. Bank executives get millions in bonuses while I struggle to get by and pay my taxes. While I pay taxes on top of taxes, the banks are receiving free money in the form of quantitative easing. What chaos we would have if these banks actually got what they deserved!
I'm not sure what your point is....

I read about bitcoin here because it interests me, but I don't actually *have* any bitcoins. The comment I made above was in response to this idea that the banking system in the US is good simply because banks aren't allowed to go out of business. That dreary list I made was to show that there are other ways to have a terrible banking system than the old days of bank runs.
The fact that you agree with me about the shitty system we have in the US has left me a little confused about your argument. I guess you think bitcoin is bad and should be regulated? I think that would be a terrible waste of this valuable endeavor to push the boundaries of money and technology.

Yes, it matters because wages don't keep up with inflation. Simple.
