for that, as i have said, you need to have physical access to the device, wich, would have the wrong master private key because its encrypted. if not stolen, then you are in the 5$ wrench hack. it cant be done through an exploit of a firmware or the usb cable
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:40:33
and there are people that claims that the u.s. is the land of freedom.... yeah rigth
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:01:32
dont be a fanboi, it is what happened. i dont mind it. thats what caused the need for segwit and ligthning network - probably would be a factor of why there is an increase dominance in this bull run.

@_date: 2019-07-14 22:47:43
so you mean that this offline machine is "free of bugs and exploits"? unless you coded the OS yourself, you cant guarantee that to me.
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:18:16
even more, i dont know why we are talking about this, a hardware wallet is not meant to be connected 100% of the time and can even be used in the offline device you described.

i've been using bitwallet for my iphone no roblem, it can generate new address from my xpub for my cold wallet and it suports accounts with segwit.  
I wish i could use a wallet that interacts with both my node and its wallet.

yay for Bisq!! keep the good work
Remeber, using bisq will turn you into a sexual tyrannossaurus, just like me

thats bs shilling, the password is never stored in the wallet in any way, only the seeds
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:10:39
just get an android phone wthout sim card, remove everything non vital to the system, put exodus wallet on it, shut down the wifi, strong passphrase and backup your seed keys, thats it. whenever you want to recibe a transaction you can just turn it on briefly to get te public address. after payment is recived, turn it off again. offline and secure.
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:06:17
for pivacy, use a new address for every utxo, otherwise people can find how much you are worth.  
on a side note, it will give you a peace of mind against the large bitcoin collider

@_date: 2019-07-30 14:49:01
OMNI transactions are bitcoin transactions.  
Download the omni core wallet, import the private key of the bitcoin address where you recived the USDT andthe USDT will be there.
THe BTC sent back is a change adress. The adress that recived the USDT is  the one that got 0.00000546 BTC. That address holds the USDT

a good hardware wallet will show you how much it is sending and to wich address, so even USB, software,malware, exploit whatever is there, you are still in control of what transaction are you signing.

Disagree, Ethereum has worked as advertised and was not intented to be stock holdings either. But since its a public blockchain, it will be prone to be (miss)used by the public, by spam like cryptokitties, just as the bitcoin blockchain was not intented to carry the stoned virus signature.
just giving objective opinion, out of bitcoin maximalism, i dont care that much about ethereum.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:42:18
nope, you are assuming the os doesnt have any exploits, and so the wallet software you are using in it. It couuld just thow you a raw transaction emptying your wallets for a hacker, for all you can guarantee, so, yeah, you are running the same risk as me, while you are only increasing the chance that granny will make a mistake and lose his funds. and that there are for example, not bugs in your house where someone can record the sound of the keyboard presses as you type your seed. and do a keyboard sniffing attack. 
while you come with 'there is no proof that such exploits do not exist or could not be found'. Somehow, like there is no god, but since there is no evidence that god does not exist, then god must exist. All the attacks i have seen on hardware wallets all requiered A PHYSICAL COPY OF YOUR WALLET, wich by the time they get it, its alredy with only the seed and the pin, but not the bip39 passphrase

@_date: 2019-07-14 23:32:04
the attacks described to poke on the memory of devices only dump the memory contents - not the flash memory. and as i said, a good hardware wallet will have a secure element that will only sign off the transactions. the unsecure element doesnt have access to the master private key
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:09:32
Bisq is not only non-KYC, but it will allso make your penis larger. Also if you dont need a fiat ramp, give a look at DEXs like block DX

@_date: 2019-07-06 13:00:45
want storage for your keys? if its an HD wallet, just encrypt it with aes256, serpent and twofish and then write it to the bitcoin blockchain.  
Thats just a storage solution. the key to decrypt it can be hidden for example in a jpeg image mailed to yourself.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:34:31

for point of sale, you can give whomever is attending customers a wallet with a read only xpub so he can generate receiving address for each purchase directly to your main wallet/bitcoin node.
for online payments, i dont know about an option besides a payment processor, but i wouldnt use one
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:40:52
your guarantee is bip39 encryption.

@_date: 2019-03-28 03:13:37
yeah, but its not just the only factor - you should chime in the capacity to get ROI out of your miner, before the network hashrate bricks it out... Ok thats IMO. What this guy is doing is smart, renting instead of mining himself. That woud be a better outcome.
i guess you could mine in a speculative way, but then again, i think i would be better off buying the coin. I have like 5k USD in the gekko bot and it gives me about 15 to 20 USD a month - better than an antminer S9! (my strategy is DEMA, a stupid moving averages)

these boneheads sell the idea that their coin is better because they have lower fees but what they dont say is that you need nothing short of a datacenter to run their nodes. They even want you to store one terabyte for each block (a shit called terablock) so you would need to pay thousands in storage per month just to send sub cent transactions through your node.

1- store your seed encrypted with aes256/serpent/twofish on the bitcoin blockchain.
2- store the decryption password for your seed in something idiotic like a selfie to your mom saying jelou, send it to her email/guasap/tinder etc.
3- use bip39 encryption in your hardware wallet so after you tell them your pin, they find out 500 doge or something.
4- try not to disclose to anyone or brag how much btc you have

I think most people just don't understand is that no one said that chances are high. Did i said that? read what everyone has written. No one EVER said that. Extremelly slim? yes. Impossible? NO. So let OP have his fun. At least he would be trying to support the network if he decides to do so.

HD wallet is your new best buddy. That way you can generate a new address every time you recive bitcoin, so as not to expose how much money you have. If you recive a large quantity, you can still split it in smaller amounts in various address in a single HD wallet

I Want everyone to know that this is not an official recognition from my goverment, my goverment sucks ass, anyway.
Its just an honorary mention. is not a recognition that he is the creator of bitcoin.
Its 'hace un reconocimiento' does not translate to "recoognizes him as'. It means more of 'gives hoonorary mention to'
The Colombian goverment has not recognized faketoshi as the creator of bitcoin, you can get one of those "diplomas' from the council of Bogota (wich does not represent at all the whole Colombia goverment) by paying them.
its written Colombia, not Columbia.

thats BS from a clueless person.  
I live in a country next to Venezuela, and we have a massive inflood of venezulan immigrants. They are using DOGE for everyday stuff between them. I even bougth a book from a venezuelan imigrant medic, he straigth up front asked me for payment in DOGE, without even knowing if i know about crypto at all. I asked him why, he told me so he could send that money to his family back in venezuela.  
So.. crypto IS helping venezuelans.  
Altough you got it rigth about the mining hardware being seized, but usually the police keep them to themselves to make extra money for themselves, not to support the goverment per se, just their crooked pockets.

Credit and Debit have chargeback options, thats why it is not an option to use them in a DEX. If you trust yor trading partner, you have the option of trading F2F and you can pay him with the credit card. There are also simpler options, like western union, cash deposit, swift....  
So, no, for the security of the traders, i doubt Bisq would ever accept credit cards.

true sad loser story: My own. I got married at the end of 2016, i invested almost 30k of personal savings so i could have a good wedding with the love of my life. At that time litecoin was 3 USD. Less than a year later, the love of my life turned out to be an overmanipulative bitch that even wanted me to do her laundry. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and so she did. I could be retired rigth now at 35yo if i had invested those 30k in litecoin. To make it worse, i remembered i wanted to postpone the wedding for at least a year because i wanted to invest in Litecoin. Would had find out she was a piece of shit woman and i would be living a decent quality of life.

shoould add that current hardware wallets use  HD wallets so every time you send bitcoin to one of them, you are sending to a totally different bitcoin address, to help out in privacy and security. 1 BTC spreaded over 20 different address is a lot better than 1 btc in only one address.

neither i am champining it as superior - in fact i belive PoW is superior to secure a network, yet it worries me 2 things:
1- the ammount of electricity consumed to sustain it just to produce a stupid block. I would like it to do something else besides hashing, like doing some science research  or some other useful shit.
2- The centralization at pools.  
Altough PoS swiftly resolves both, i know there is a reason why ethereum has not switched to PoS. Im heavily invested in some PoS coins and it has been a shitstorm of forks and upgrades and corrections to the code base. I have seen some teams do a lot to resolve the nothing-at-stake problem, like Vericoin's PoST, but even they are going in a mix of PoW/PoS (binary chain) to secure the network.

the point is true.... you cant withdraw from binance, you cant "sell" for real dollars.... but still you could sell for whatever stablecoin they are trading and stop the price increase, if it does have any real power over it (What is the "binance" dominance over all other exchanges?).

4- Spread all your bitcoin in at least 20 address  in a HD wallet.
5- Done.

i was saying the same thing before BTC crashed from 6k to 3k.

1- Its very useful, jewelry and electronics.  
2- It has its very own proof-of-work. Mining gold is extremely expensive, giving it value just by mining it.  
3- Its scarce, the avaliable supply is droping and becoming harder to come by.
So no, not like paper money. Paper money's value is based on debt, you must work to pay back to whomever loaned you your money.

it uses the needed utxos even if they are at different address

yeah, lookeed into ith, there is a method to run a local block explorer - altough too complex for average joe. Maybe it would be easier to look at any of the avaliable block explorers through TOR.

and what doge does, too. Just much better than bcash :)

well, you can expect anything from the Btrash network,,, but im going to read about this betterhash protocol. Thanks.

well, since my cognitive capacity is that of a normal human, and i am not very versed on computers and its related sciences, yes i have, and i never had any problems with Bisq.

for extreme long term, cryptosteel or alikes. Or you could just write the private key to the bitcoin blockchain, after AES-256/twofish encryption.

no, confirmations are up to the miners - if anything, it gives me a peace of mind that my node is clean and not censoring/tracing/logging my transactions or something like that

i only own like 1000 xrp or something -  i care little if it goes up or down and its mostly a centralized banking shitcoin.  
But.... it haves a lot of stuff that could potentially make it easy to get to  coin at 20-30 usd a pop. in part because the whole project like to bend over to goverment rules and banking terms and mostly because the ridicously high TPS it can achive. That kind of stuff is atractive to the corporative greed investors  
So i dont understand why call it cripple. i mean, you can cleanse your arse througly with my ripple for all i care, but cripple is not the rigth name for it.

Its hard to catch the concept - DOGE has been succesful in almost every way possible as money. Ok, here it goes:  
\- There is no total cap, yes.  
\- But the reward gets halving.  
\- A lot of these coins continue to get mined, but the reward drops proportionaly and through halving.  
\- The supply, altough infinite, is programed, unlike USD, wich can be printed at will.  
\- So its not really inflationary, neither deflationary. The correct term would be anti inflationary.  
\- These new coins come in existence as reward for litecoin miners (yes, litecoin, its merged mined), so they will still hold value, as long as litecoin dificulty remains high.  
Its the big concept, i migth have something wrong, but thats how i get it.

migth not hurt to review that statement. bisq is a dex and runs through tor, wthout any "account".
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:23:04
nope, they are buying lemmonade and enslaving little girls like these to sell them for Bitcoin

any service that haves KYC -will- leak your info, thats the sole purpose to ask for kYC - allegedly, to the autorithies as a counter measure of money laundering/drug dealing/terrorism funding. Non-allegedly, your info is there and can be leaked intentionally or unintentionally, regardless their privacy policy.

probably the bets way to store your keys for almost free would be to write them in the bitcoin blockchain, after AES256-Serpent-twofish
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:00:53
decentralized non custodial exchanges ' wich are indeed more prone to coins loosiing for just uster error
