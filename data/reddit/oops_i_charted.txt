Have you tried any lightning wallets?  I tried one out on testnet and it was about as seamless as it could be - the only difference from any other wallet really was that it had a channels tab.  And you don’t even really need to mess with that, it sets itself up automatically.  Honestly, it’s just like using a regular wallet.  The Zap wallet looks even better than the one I used - you can see demos on YouTube.  As long as the network works as intended, don’t see any reason anyone wouldn’t be happy about it :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:00:38
It just looks complex because this is just how it works under the hood.  In practice it won’t be much different from using a regular wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:03:57
You don’t need to understand what it’s doing, this graphic is just showing how it works from a technical perspective.  Using the lightning network won’t be any more complicated than making a normal bitcoin transaction, the wallets basically work the same as a bitcoin wallet.

What I’m saying is that it doesn’t need to be adopted as a currency to stabilize.  It can be adopted as digital gold first, and it already is.  I’d even go as far as to say that it doesn’t even need to become a currency at all to be valuable, but if it stabilizes and is widely distributed throughout the world, it will probably naturally become one.
Gold is not a currency, and its uses in industry and jewelry etc don’t justify it’s value - but it has been the best way we’ve found to store value because it has certain properties, for example it’s scarcity, and the fact that it’s difficult to counterfeit.  Bitcoin has almost all of the properties of gold, and those properties are superior in basically every category.  It’s not an immediately intuitively thing to understand, but I can highly recommend this presentation to bring it all into context:  
I’m not asking you to buy bitcoin, because it doesn’t matter to me either way.  I just want people to understand it better, mostly because I ALREADY feel bad for all the people in the future who are going to wish they looked into this a little more deeply (honestly not trying to be condescending).
And yes, I did get involved early on :)
But if I had discovered it today, and came to understand it as well as I do now, I would still be buying at $20k, $100k, whatever it’s at.
The only “suckers” are the people buying in hoping to get rich, and not taking the time to really understand what they’re getting into - because those are the people that buy high and then sell in a panic at a loss.  Nobody that I know of that truly understands bitcoin ever plans on selling, because the end game is that eventually you won’t have to - because the world has switched over to a better form of money.

So you’re just going to ignore everything I said that explains why your comment is wrong?  You’re not very good at trolling
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:10
You already know why that’s a terrible argument but I’ll say it anyway to help out the people you’re trying to fool.  
Bitcoin is still a relatively early stage, evolving project.  You may be right about the CURRENT state of bitcoin, but that’s going to change in the near future with the lightning network and future developments we probably haven’t even thought of yet.
Bitcoin will be too volatile to be practical as a currency until it reaches a high enough level on the adoption curve and the price stabilizes - and that’s the case with any cryptocurrency.  So in the meantime it’s perfectly useful and desirable as a store of value like gold.  That doesn’t mean being a purely a store of value is the end game.
If you’re not purely trolling, you’re at least very short sighted.  But I’m pretty sure you are just trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:06:28
Forget the currency part for now - it will obviously not work as an every day currency for most people until the price stabilizes, because nobody will want to spend something that doubles in value every few months.  The price will stabilize once it’s adopted widely enough.  Its current utility is as an uncensorable store of value, like digital gold.  First things first.
And, I wouldn’t take that bet, you’re going to lose :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:29:03
It will bounce back, it’s just a matter of how long it’ll take.  When bitcoin dropped from $1000 back in 2013, I fully expected it to go much higher someday, I just didn’t know it would take over 3 years.
That being said, I don’t think it will take nearly as long to turn around this time.  It could turn around like this week and continue the parabolic trend, or it could lose steam and go into a bear market.  There’s no reason to worry about it long term though - just be prepared for it to take many months and don’t stress over it constantly.  Just stop watching the price and forget about it for a while, you’ll be ok ��

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:07:52
Saying bitcoin is dead is pretending there’s no future and no possibility of improvement, and ignoring what’s actually being worked on right now.
Saying that bitcoin is dead for the reasons you’re giving is like saying your car is dead while it’s in the shop getting upgraded.
Bitcoin is very slow today and does have high transaction fees, but back in the 90’s I was paying $5 a day for the internet and that was slow as hell.  I didn’t consider the internet dead, and it improved over time.
If the lightning network had nothing to show for it and there was a question about whether it would ever see the light of day, you might have some semblance of a point.  But the lightning network has made mainnet transactions and is basically finished.  There are multiple teams working on multiple implementations of it.  Once it’s more thoroughly tested it will be ready for use.  It’s not a matter of IF anymore, it’s right around the corner, and it will be a huge improvement on the way we do most of our transactions.  And other things will be developed in the future.
If you don’t like the lightning network, or don’t like high fees, or anything about bitcoin, go use other coins!  Nobody’s trying to convince you to stay around!  Why do you bother to troll about bitcoin?  You don’t have to use it.  I have lots of problems with lots of other coins, but I don’t troll their subreddits.  And even if I did, I wouldn’t have to lie and skew the truth.
Who are you people?  Get a hobby!
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:04:25
Volume just means how much was traded in a day, how much was bought AND sold.  So if I bought $1000 worth and sold it a few seconds later, and repeated that 100x, I would have accounted for $1m in volume for the day.  It’s not a measure of how much money was injected into bitcoin, just trading activity.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:32:47
This is history guys.  The one problem I had with picturing bitcoin’s adoption was that you need internet access, it seemed like the only weakness.  
I never thought something like this would happen so soon...the name “Blockstream” makes so much sense now.  And just think about the fact that they didn’t setup a proprietary system that you have to buy specialized hardware for or subscribe to a service...it’s all open source, you can get the hardware yourself...they did this for the good of bitcoin.  I hope the vitriol directed towards them is softened a little bit from this.  I mean this is the spirit of bitcoin in action folks.

But don’t get me wrong, I would love it if there was a homeland for people like you, so you could all go there, feel nice and safe and comfortable, complain about the rest of the world together, be “brave and decent”, avoid things like circumcision, anal sex and “change,” and leave us the fuck alone.

I just watched this video expecting to hear some infuriating bullshit since the way the post was worded made it seem like the guy in the linked video was a Nazi (he’s not, I guess the OP was talking about a different guy).  I consider myself pretty liberal in most ways and I have to say when I saw “rebel media” and they started talking about the psychology of social justice warriors I was 100% ready to hear some Alex Jones style bullshit propaganda. 
But WOW, this was a totally fascinating conversation, not what I expected at all.  I can’t speak for any other Rebel Media content or their political bent but this particular conversation is worth a watch for sure.  
I kept expecting them to come to some kind of biased conclusion (and I don’t know if that’s what the host was hoping for) but it ended up being a really interesting look at the personality traits that lead people to different sides of the political spectrum and how we need all types for society to work.
Man...watching this video thinking the guy was a Nazi, and getting drawn in and realizing I agreed with everything he was saying...was a totally bizarre experience for me lol.  It had me wondering how much I actually knew about Nazis.  I’m glad I looked him up and realized he’s not - It might have led to a lot of awkward conversations at the local Nazi recruitment center before I realized my mistake lol

It hasn’t been “moved to L3” as if it’s been downgraded or pushed back, it just means that a new layer has been thought up that makes lightning even better when its in between.  Lightning can still be L2 and will probably be L2 first because it will be ready first.  And I️ could be wrong but I️ believe it can also be both L2 and L3 at the same time.
It’s not like this is a new layer that is required for lightning to work, it just improves it.
Amazing that these new innovations can be spun to look like a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:53:14
Maybe so you can see that lightning is making progress, and is actually a thing that’s being worked on, so you can cross it off your list of things to troll about?

I️ hope they already did it when it was .5 btc haha
I️ wonder if they will sell bit by bit during pumps and average the price out? (Hint, bitmex - this is what you should do :)
It would be a good way to call the bluff on future pumps.  If they’re going to pump, why not make it benefit US rather than them selling to themselves to fake the volume?

Ok.  Maybe I’m jumping to conclusions here but it sounded like your comment was making the argument I️ keep hearing that lightning is vaporware or it’s years away etc.  Maybe we have different definitions of ‘in production’ but I️ take that to mean that they’re working on it.  If I’m working on recording an album it’s ‘in production’.  (&amp; yes I️ read some of your comment history and noticed some things that suggest you’re an audio engineer, or know something about it - I’m one as well so even though we’re spatting a little bit I️ have the automatic inclination to like you lol)
My point was just that it’s obviously in production if there’s a working version you can play with right now, even if it’s not finished or on a testnet.  Most of these kinds of things have to start on testnet anyway...you don’t want to use software that’s still in development with actual money.
I’m not telling you that you should actually go play with the lightning app....I’m saying that the fact that an early version is out there, that works, that you can play with right now...makes it far from vaporware and there’s nothing to indicate that it’s not going to be a real working product in the relatively near future.
Yes it’s taking a long time, but new ground is being broken here, it’s a huge project, and something that could potentially carry billions or trillions of dollars on it’s back.  So it shouldn’t be rushed.  It’s more important to get it right than get it done fast.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:08:40
What you’re missing is that it’s charting a trend, it’s obviously not supposed to predict every dip and bubble along the way.  It’s just one smooth line lol nobody thinks it will actually follow that exactly.
It’s a chart that tries to generally predict where you might expect the price curve to look like based on some statistical factors, it can’t take into account human factors like Mt Gox.  That was a huge part of the extended bear market, and since we found out that those stolen coins were steadily being sold off on BTC-e for those years, there was an artificial downward pressure going on.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:28:54
You can literally download and use the testnet version, I️ don’t know how people get away with calling it vaporware.  Is every project that’s actively being worked on but doesn’t have a finished release vaporware?

This is total BS.  The rally is not even being led by Bitfinex, it’s mostly being led by GDAX, which STRONGLY suggests organic demand.  GDAX has mostly been pulling the price on Bitfinex and Bitstamp up kicking and screaming, so this tether stuff is nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:16:56
You’ve got it totally backwards.  Preventing companies from prioritizing data IS WHAT KEEPS IT THE WILD WEST.  Why would you want to hand over that kind of power to these monopolies.
What we really need to do is change the regulations to make it easier for ISP’s to compete - if it was a free market in THAT regard, net neutrality would matter a lot less because people would have more choice.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:26:31
While your points had me thinking a little differently about the issue, I’m not sure how this could work in practice.  I️ mean if it was something obvious like an oil spill on your property, fine that’s easy - sue the oil company.
But how do you sue someone over the polluted air that hits your property?  That’s a little absurd.  
“Your honor, I️ present before the court a sample of the air in my backyard, which was polluted by these 100 million cars, waste gas from the cows on these 100 farms, and these billions of people in China.  And definitely this one company I️ really don’t like, they polluted it too.”
It’s a nice thought and it would probably be better if we could run everything by pure market forces and common law, but I️ just can’t see how it’s practical.
Not to say that letting the government control everything is the answer, because that has its own set of problems.  Both ways suck.  
Maybe one day we’ll be able to completely change the way our society handles governance using code, game theory and incentive structures like bitcoin does, and we can both reduce the need for government and keep corporations in check in a more natural way.  But until then it seems like we’re going to have to continue trying to find a balance between regulation &amp; free markets.

I disagree.  I think it would be nice (I had a large amount of btc on bitmex during the bch fork), but ultimately I think it’s up to them as long as they make their plans clear.  They gave everyone ample warning and told people they should withdraw their coins if they wanted BCH, and I chose to keep mine there to take advantage of the volatility.
The reason I feel like it should be up to them is that they can’t be held responsible for every little fork that happens.  I mean should they have to upgrade their wallets and go through extra work if I decide to create my own little fork of bitcoin?  They’re not obligated to sort through the technical issues of every little cash grab fork that happens, and you’re not obligated to keep your coins on their exchange.  As long as they’re up front about their plans and give people enough warning, I have no problem with it.
And like I said, I would love it if they decided to distribute BCH, because I’d be in for a big payday, but I understand their position.
Also, they’re a BTC only derivatives exchange, it’s not like they deal in multiple coins - so it’s a little different situation than a poloniex or bittrex.

I apologize for being a dick, I didn’t know you were genuinely asking.  Need some more sleep I’m cranky today :)
To answer your question, miners are a basic and important part of the equation and bitcoin can’t exist without them.  They’re the ones verifying the transactions.  When there is no more bitcoin left to mine, they will survive off of the transaction fees.  Which doesn’t seem like much now, but if bitcoin is still around after the last bitcoin has been mined (which is over 100 years from now I think), it’s pretty safe to assume there will be a LOT of transactions going on.
Edit:  I downvoted my rude comment for you :)
