Can't you accomplish the "walk over a border with as many coins as you want, and no one will know" functionality by saving an encrypted backup of your wallet to the cloud?  You could cross the border without any physical possessions and only the encryption password in your brain, then just download and decrypt your wallet the next time you have computer access.

Great video.  Does anyone have a link to more info about a P2P currency exchange like he touched on at the end? 
To me that is the potential Achilles heal of Bitcoin - if governments around the world begin to consider any electronic payments outside the financial system as illegal, and then make laws against (or put large taxes on) conversion of BTC to/from national currency.  How would a viable P2P currency exchange function?

What things are a *must*?  Forget about minutiae like DDOS attacks and look at the big picture.
Big picture:  What is "money"? Does bitcoin meet the definition of money?
The question "what is money" alone is enough to spend 10 days bullshitting about, so the question "is bitcoin money" will give you plenty of material to bullshit about in an academic setting.
Wikipedia generally sucks for topics that tend to devolve into edit wars, but here is a good start for "what is money?"

The logic behind scenario 1 is completely flawed.  Just because I know that bitcoins are used in many black market transactions doesn't make me a money launderer for engaging in BTC transactions.  I also know that USD are used in many black market transactions, but just because I handle a $100 bill that was used in a drug deal 5 years ago doesn't make me a money launderer.  Just because Bitcoin has "illegitimate" uses doesn't mean the law can presume that all uses of Bitcoin are illegitimate. 
mean anyone who exchanges USD and BTC is a money launderer or aiding money laundering.  By that logic everyone who doesn't use Bitcoin is also a money launderer, because USD are used in many black market transactions and USD is commonly exchanged for other currencies.

Just a reminder that when politicians start crying in earnest that Bitcoin must be stopped, it's because Bitcoin represents a lack of government control.  Money laundering will just be one of the BS reasons they give for trying to crack down - the real reason is control.

Shouldn't you really, *really* turn that computer off immediately and stop using it.  There's enough money at stake to hire an expert who might be able to recover your data even if it's been overwritten once.

The show was produced months ago (evidenced by the $1900/oz gold price they show).  The press release was produced this week.  That is why the press release mentions it and the show does not.

I've already watched several segments and in the first or second one the professor mentions it as part of the course.

I think that's a fantastic interview for a high level overview of bitcoin for new users.  It's non-technical and touches on the big philosophical issues - in particular what makes money money.

Week 1's lectures are online now.  After this course ends, there will be a Cryptography II class starting.  You don't need to take the tests or do the coursework to watch the lectures.

The main one I notice is that he spends a lot of time destroying a straw man argument - that Bitcoin will replace national currencies.  I don't think most people expect Bitcoin to replace national currencies; it fills a niche demand for methods of transferring wealth outside the traditional financial system.

You can get a certificate if you do the coursework and exams (and pass!).  Now, of course, no one really cares about such certificates.  However, as more and more top universities offer classes online, the more respectable these certificates become.  I would certainly put it on a resume if it was very relevant to the job you're applying for.

I don't think you know what "black market" means if you think people will pay attention to currency laws in their already illegal transactions.
It's easy enough to make legal market purchases of BTC illegal, and it's easy enough to regulate/outlaw exchanges physically located in the US, but good luck trying to confiscate or outlaw bitcoins themselves.
There is and always will be a HUGE demand for a method of transferring wealth outside the banking system.  Ignore the debate whether hiding wealth from governments is or isn't immoral, it's completely irrelevant.  All that's relevant is that there will always be a huge demand for secretly transferring wealth.  Bitcoin is the first technology that really satisfies this demand and permits secret transfer of wealth anywhere in the world in minutes.  I think it's likely that BTC exchanges will pop up in tax haven countries, basically for the sole purpose of expediting conversion of USD/EUR to BTC.

"monetary base" is probably more accurate than market cap.

Sounds like at most they will mention Bitcoin in passing.  Looks like a interesting show anyway though.

Kudos to the altruistic thieves for this brilliant heist!  They caused a bank to suffer a huge loss which the central bank will paper over with newly created money if necessary to preserve depositors' faith in the bank.  That this 'huge loss' was caused by thieves rather than leveraged investments blowing up is irrelevant.  Let's hope the heist was big enough to threaten the stability of the financial system so that central banks have to inject enough liquidity to ramp equities another 25% this year.
At least the money stolen by thieves makes its way to the real economy in the form of Rolexes and Ferraris, instead of just vaporizing in a poof of credit destruction.

Technically, it is illegal to accept anything other than US dollars as legal tender in a US transaction.  These are the "legal tender laws" that Ron Paul rails against.  Those laws simply aren't enforced against the mini-mart on the border that accepts pesos.  But, for example, if you were to try to enforce a contract in court in which you were to be paid in gold as legal tender, the court wouldn't enforce it.
The whole point is that there shouldn't be any legal tender laws - people should be free to use whatever they want, and they shouldn't be taxed any differently if they pay in dollars, pesos, gold or bitcoin.

This show was produced months ago, when gold was $1900/oz.  The only reason that the press release OP linked to mentioned bitcoin is that bitcoin is all over the news the last two weeks, so they wanted to generate some buzz.
The show was interesting just in pointing out how ludicrously inefficient and wasteful cash is.  I hated the prick at the end who calls for abolishing cash *because the government can't track it.*  Go fuck yourself asshole.

Isn't it pretty obvious that all governments hate bitcoin and see it as nothing more than a way to evade taxes and capital controls?  The writing is on the wall that all the governments that issue the major currencies will eventually try to shut down all exchanges.  A decentralized method of converting local currency to BTC and BTC to local currency must emerge.  It is way too easy for governments to shut down exchanges.
Oh, and don't get caught up in the "law" or the reasons governments give for shutting down exchanges.  Sure they might justify shutting down an exchange by saying such and such law was violated, but even if the exchange is doing everything by the books, governments will just make new laws or regulations that an exchange inherently can't obey.
You know the old saying - give me control over a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws.  Governments will do everything they can to prevent loss of their control over money.  Technology needs to trump these government efforts.  A decentralized anonymous method of converting between local currency and bitcoin is the holy grail, but is it possible?

How did they get Bitcoin into a box they control in the first place?  A better cartoon would be politicians trying to catch Bitcoin mosquitoes with anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering fish nets.

It could mean there is little supply at that price.  There would be plenty of supply at higher prices.  It could be that Bitfloor simply doesn't have enough liquidity and it creates an arbitrage opportunity.
