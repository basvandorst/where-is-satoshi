Thanks, I will look into it

Haha I know what you mean but why would you not want to take advantage of half priced coins? I'm pretty confident they will allow withdrawals soon.

Thank you finally someone who can give an answer instead of their two cents.  I saw that takes ten days and I've been verified forever, I just wanted a faster method.  That doesn't seem worth it to me honestly.

I haven't moved any coins yet but man it looks enticing right now.  I'm still pretty confident Gox will allow withdrawals again and they are worth about 1/3 of other markets at the moment

You're a little out of the loop here. Snapchat advertises on a user's story, and they now have a section called [discover](  Also, they were [recently valued]( at $19 billion.

Hm thanks for the info I'm pretty paranoid about about security so I might have to try that as well on my Windows partition
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:02:41
Isn't there a fee with this?

2280.24 a few minutes ago.  Thats near a quarter mil, crazy
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:28:40
+1 for title

I've held on to my coin for about a month, so I know from personal experience that I have made about 2.5x my $200 investment, but in the short term I'm trying to keep their interest when they're trusting me with their money.  I think I'm just going to suggest to buy more when it falls.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:48:46
Uhh there has to be some way to capitalize on that price difference
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:54:30
Sweet. Do you have any suggestions for something with a trading style interface? (Real time data, graphs, etc)

An expected thing that I've learned about bitcoin is that it has taught me a few things about economics.  Being a computer science major, a combination of computer skills and economics could come in handy more than bitcoin.  It has also driven me to want to spread its word through my community, which has led me to create a bitcoin website I'm looking to release in the next week.

I saw this, shot up the price almost $2.
Imagine what that quarter mil will be worth in a couple months

It's likely the Mt.Gox lag, not bitcoinity.org's lag.  I'm seeing almost a 500 second lag right now

I'm working on a website right now.  I'll have it out by monday if you are interested.  It will be launched on this thread and my local community.

Don't invest anything more than you're willing to lose. The last 24 hours proved that true. 
Wait til it crashes later, buy up, and it should climb
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:48:45
Didn't know I could do that, but this actually worked!  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:22:53
Well put.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:45:19
I've looked under both my account history and the confirmation email and don't see any transaction IDs
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:54:42
Multibit has been my go-to
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:08:47
I have an iPhone and use block chain.  You have a mobile wallet that allows you to scan QR codes, send money, and store wallet addresses.  Not bad but still missing a few features I hope they are working on.

I think OP is saying tomorrow is going to get wild.  I will agree with the 14000 people waiting to use Mt.Gox.
