Hey can you help me as well? I used electrum to send some bitcoins. Here is my transaction 
I sent them yesterday. Initially I set minimum fee because I thought it was the ammount you pay the wallet creator for sending the money (I'm noob) but later I increased it to the maximum available but it is still very low. When can I expect it to arrive to the receiver? Is it possible it wont be received at all? And what can I do to speed this up without spending more than $10?

But I can't find my previous address listed anywhere in Electrum. Is this normal?

I can see the addresses but I can't see THE address I used last time

Why is that dumb? My bank account number stays the same. If you want me to use bitcoin like the real money everyone on this fucking sub believes it is then maybe start working towards making it simpler for people that are not that much into the bitcoin. 
I want to use the same fucking address because that's what people do with their money.

Someone sent me a small ammount of btc and I now know that it works but this address is not displayed among the others so this list was/ is useless to me.

ctrl + a does nothing for me

Just to confirm:
I'm sure the address I received btc from stock exchange last time is not on my address list. I made this transfer about 2 weeks ago. 
Should I still withdraw my btc to this address even though I can't see it anywhere in Electrum?

I downloaded it and I checked in the same place before, the address I used (2 weeks ago and it was last transfer with my wallet) isn't there. 
Should I still send btc on this address even though it's not there or wait for new one to be activated?
