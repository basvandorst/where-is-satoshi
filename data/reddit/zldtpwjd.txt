From lurking forever here, buy now if you are planning to hold for the long term. If Bitcoin goes to the moon then the price now is a steal.
If you do not planning on holding then I'm not sure what kind of advice people can give you except buy low sell high.

The dip lasted like 10 seconds. I think you are right in that the "buy the dip" posters will be here soon.

I don't think the ride is over.

To buy at a lower price. At least, that was the theory. Sell, wait for the eventual dip, buy low.

People asked "Why did you sell?". Well, being the idiot I am, I tried to sell the coins so I could potentially buy more at a lower price and then hold.
The silver lining is that with what I did, I didn't lose any money and broke even.. I've realized the whole thing is very much psychological. When I don't have any Bitcoins, my brain is all "Go and buy! ~~I'll~~ it'll keep going up!" but as soon as I make a significant purchase my brain is like "Its gonna fall, Its gonna fall."

The fees at these ATM's must be astonomical. I went to a strip club in Denver and the ATM fee was like $50.

So the stalemate right now is good for Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin's value and marketcap are heading south.

If we get to a fork, BTC will be cheap enough where I could buy 2x the BTC and BU for the price I'm holding now.
