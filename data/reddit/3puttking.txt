My thoughts....crypto currencies should not be the only thing in your investment portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:21:51
So let’s talk about it. Why do you say it’s “dead in the water right now”? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:12:07
It’s called a pullback. If the price drops +30% then you can start asking questions like this. Until then, posts like this just highlights your youth, lack of knowledge, and that you probably shouldn’t be playing in this space. Go buy a total market stock fund if you can’t stomach a couple days of volatility and flat returns.

Serious question: how long would it have taken to send the same $150 thru a site like PayPal? Would the fee be around $4 too? I’m assuming the power of BTC comes from transferring larger sums of money across lines that would usually be tedious to navigate (i.e cross border wire transfers)

You can lose your invested money via any investment other than a savings account or CD that is backed by the fed reserve. Null point to even make on their part.

Just sent. Let me know if it comes through. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:17:13
Probably because OP is a POS bot that’s contributed absolutely nothing besides links to “articles” on Reddit, likely all full of ads just like this one. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:13
Some regulation would be nice. It’s a damn free for all right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:26:36
Read. Then read some more. And then read a little bit more. Youtube videos help too. And don’t just learn about crypto, read up on traditional investing as well. If this is your first foray with investing, you might be in for a “boring” time with the more traditional investment vehicles that should make up the majority of your portfolio (i.e mutual funds, ETFs, bonds and blue chip stocks).

Most of this noise ppl are making is likely because they have invested more than they can afford to, or allocated far too much of their overall portfolios, to crypto currencies. Those freaking out should recognize that they are far too heavily weighted in crypto for their personal risk tolerances.

How would Coinbase going public have any impact on the value of BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:31:53
Assuming they bring more crytpos onboard it could be a great buy. More currencies means more transactions, which means more transaction fees for Coinbase to bank. Just need to beef up their IT infrastructure and customer support.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:16
OP, don’t avoid this question. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:38:37
Have sell orders in place to dump some coins just in cash shit starts to head south real quick. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:34:19
What makes you think Coinbase is going to get breached? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:54:11
Go buy a Big Mac instead.

The recent onslaught of posts like this really emphasize how young, immature and inexperienced a lot of the folks on this sub-Reddit are. The hype from the November run-up drew in a lot of people that have no business being invested in a volatile asset like BTC...something stable like a S&amp;P 500 index fund might be better aligned with the low risk tolerance levels. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:37
Coinbase is an exchange, and they make money when people execute trades...look at this from their perspective. The more coins they offer, the more transactions they'll see...so the more money they'll make. This is business. It is what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:20
Agreed. That was a whole different level of volatility. Equivalent of a panic sell-off...BTC and LTC got HAMMERED. ETH handled it pretty well and is already back in the green. I picked up some more on the dip. I'll let things stabilize for a bit before I make any other moves though. This game isn't for those with a soft stomach...damn. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:48:50
Why do you think it’s the top? If it were the top of the bubble that implies it would have crashed when it hit $19k...not stabilized in the $18k range. This is a shit post and ur just another “crypto” investor that has no clue wtf ur talking about or what the future of the market is. Keep on speculating. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:05:55
Your best bet is doing some serious searching, reading and note taking. Need to approach this with wanting to actually put in some work to teach yourself, rather than expecting folks to just spoon feed you. Get a notebook, or open a word document, and start taking notes while searching this site and the broader internet. Search things like, what is bitcoin, where do buy bitcoin, how to buy bitcoin, where to store bitcoin, future of bitcoin, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:03:55
Apples and Oranges. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:57:04
Yep..these are signs that the bubble is continuing to stretch. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:42:01
It’s down less than 5%...that’s barely even a correction. Just typical volatility 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:34
Transfer it to a hardware wallet and store that somewhere safe...I just ordered a ledger nano and plan to move my crypto holdings onto and and throw it in the gun safe. I’ll still keep an eye on the value of the currencies I do hold, but have no plans to sell within the next 1-2 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:12:43
How exactly are the two topics related? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:55
Because it just happened and rather than having one centralized post to discuss, every other user, like yourself, is choosing to post a new thread about it rather than contributing to one of the other 5 dozen that have already popped up. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:51
Can you have your parents sign up for you and just commit that you’ll be on the hook for all taxes due as a result of future sales? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:28
It's even worse over at the Litecoin subreddit...to me, it's evidence that the bubble is stretching. Folks are willing to cut corners to get a piece of the pie (i.e. minors illegally opening accounts) and others are actually suggesting you take a home-equity loan just to invest more into Litecoin. It's great that the run-up has been so strong...but this shit is getting scary.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:23:58
Lmfao. So just to confirm, you think Bitcoin is going to topple the entire system and bring down the govt.? Alrighty then. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:37:22
I’m confused..what merit does his opinion on financial management and investing even hold? It’s December 2017 and he still says he has NO CLUE what Bitcoin is...then says he’s been using the web for a long time. It’s not hard to do a google search and figure out what Bitcoin is...come on Ben. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:05:09
How are crypto currencies going to fix the allocation of capital? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:22:21
Because you simply have to spend cash to purchase living essentials, buy things, pay bills, etc. People can’t save every single dollar they make. Bitcoin price is pretty volatile right now, while the value of cash (USD) is extremely stabilized.

Do you have an emergency fund in place? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:53
Consult a lawyer, not Reddit.

So did he just get lucky or is he actually wise well beyond his years?
