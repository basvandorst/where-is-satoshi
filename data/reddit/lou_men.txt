For conservative investors 5% of your money in BTC is always a good idea.  If your money is GBP, heading into Brexit, 10% would be a better hedge against potential disasters.

Bitcoin is an open source software project.  It can and will adapt to changes in technology.  Assuming general purpose quantum computing can be achieved and will be a threat, then the system will adapt. The Bitcoin ecosystem will be robust when facing these types of challenges.

lakh = 100,000
crore = 10,000,000
So 35 lakhs is 3,500,000 or 3.5 million.
Thing about India is crypto is not at all prevalent.  Especially with ordinary people described in this article.  Gold and cash are held by those who fear bank failure and corruption.  In India this is needed to survive.  Crypto could  help in India but so far it’s impact is very limited.

The supply could be increased with a hardfork of bitcoin.  This would result in a new AltCoin that would be based on bitcoin but would NOT be the original bitcoin.  The new AltCoin would not be adopted because it offers no advantages.  It’s key new feature is allowing for more than 21 million coins and that is a disadvantage.  No one would adopt or support this and the new coin would be worthless.
