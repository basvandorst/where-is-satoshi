This ^.  For anybody getting cold feet, likely coming from trading equities this is the reality... More often than you would like you could see your entire portfolio down 20-30% at certain times.  If this were my stocks I would be checking the news for a war or country collapse :)  Welcome to crypto!

You were obviously too young to have market investments in 2000 and 2008.  Thanks for the laugh however.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:10:18
Yes but, like me, you also remember that you had equities in 2000 that no longer existed in 2001 ;)

In Dec, this was just another ordinary day.  After the "stabilization" a couple of weeks ago (yeah, try not to laugh) I think somebody is seriously manipulating stuff today.  I've got my orders in for dips and it will likely be a "charts closed " type of day.

That statement is sound in general but absurd in the context of my reply to the original statement.

To get specific my problem with his statement was the use of the words "much safer"  That's a foolish thing to say in 2018 given the length of the current Bull run.  "Safer"... no doubt.

Ummm yes, i'm aware and profited.  Where does it say I did any different?

I am convinced 1000% that you should be very careful about setting people up for financial ruin.

Or... the merchant doesn't want to sell you a $20 meal  and have that $20 turn into $15 tomorrow.  Something essential people are missing at the moment.  The reverse is also something to consider. I like to explain it as the $400 pair of sneakers.  You buy a pair for $200 worth of bitcoin.  Within a month Bitcoin goes on another rally and doubles.  Had you of waited you could still have those shoes but also an extra $200 of Bitcoin in your wallet.  In this case the merchant is making out like a bandit.

Seriously i'm pretty numb to these price drops now.  This is where the rookie investors can get in serious trouble.  Unless you absolutely need to save the ship don't be trying to salvage a 50% loss on your investment.  If you're in that situation probably didn't really have the money to invest to begin with. HODL until Santa squeezes his fat cheeks down your chimney.

He left the bitcoins on the hotel room dresser and walked out while she slept.

Coming from the equities side of things crypto is frustrating as shit.  Chart trend and MAs calling a good run... Oh look at that, down 10%.  hahaha, FML.

Pricing.... Fuck off, seriously.

To be perfectly honest this is not how I thought this day was going to go at all with CME being added.  I was sure we were in for a huge run.  Then again could happen tomorrow and we'll all be like "told ya so!" :)
