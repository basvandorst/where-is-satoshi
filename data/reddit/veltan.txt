Dollar cost averaging. Buy when it’s going up, buy when it’s going down.

Keeping it on an exchange is always risky, but you have to be the one to decide if it’s worth the risk. A lot of people keep small amounts on Coinbase or wherever, but if they ever go down your bitcoin is lost. It’s also counterproductive if you value bitcoin as a project in decentralized finance and not just a speculative investment.

I said the same thing the first time bitcoin skyrocketed from $30 to over $200. I patted myself on the back when it crashed 70% in a day.
Now I sure wish I’d bought $200 BTC.

Yep. If I had a satoshi for every person who FOMO bought when it goes up and panic sold when it went down, I could probably afford the transaction fees to move the BTC I’ve accumulated in the meantime.

Sorry for jumping in on an old post, but this is the first description of LN that made sense to me so I hope you don't mind me asking a followup question.
If I send money to someone over a LN channel, and they later want to send that money to someone else, doesn't the original LN channel have to close to release the funds to them in the first place? How is that any different than a normal blockchain transaction? I am having trouble wrapping my head around how this saves time and money for anyone outside the context of parties who regularly exchange funds.

There’s no way to know. Do it if you want to, and if you can afford to lose it all.

Mining is already centralized. The concern is more about people running full nodes. Bigger blocks make that less attractive, which is a problem since there’s no real incentive to run one anyway if you’re an average person. People care about convenience more than trustless consensus, and that will likely never change.
That being said, yeah, I’d like an electronic p2p currency and not just e-gold, so I actually do want to buy coffee on chain. I’m also skeptical that LN will be a miracle fix to making BTC useful as cash.
BTC and Bitcoin Cash are just trying different approaches to solving the problem. The shilling and pettiness from folks on both sides is just embarrassing and makes it even harder for newcomers to take any of this seriously.

What determines if moving the money is related to a trade? If I transfer newly purchased BTC from a Coinbase wallet to a desktop wallet, can I just add that to the cost basis of the BTC? What if I do it a week later instead of immediately after the purchase?
