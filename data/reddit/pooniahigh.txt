Crypto market many times gets manipulated by wrong news creating FUD, big whales and future contracts. Now why dont the developers make some platfrom where only legit news gets to be published and only by legit people removing false news completely, using lets say a voting system. That way the things like SCAM ICOs, Bitconnet can never grow and only legit things grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:11:26
A good news 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:30:18
Why do all the coins drop at the same time? 
Like why Etherium is falling? 
And if people from the future contracts are manipulating the market shouldn't alt coins rise when BTC falls? I am new to crypto, can someone please clear this doubt.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:47:58
Their own decisions. Once their judgements go wrong they lose credibility forever. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:17:00
I heard there is no SEC meeting today. Actually I also didnt find any such official statement. 
Is it a FUD?
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:00:58
yeah its the first time I have seen this sub 5k in last 5 months. 
One reason can be that GDAX was under maintainence for some time today. But still &lt;5k is too less
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:55:11
Makes sense 
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:15:07
10k 10k 10k
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:02:46
what is up with these sellers. 
Can you please not sell for a moment and just hold?
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:19:54
I am not TA expert, but if BTC crosses 10k now, it might jump to 11k very soon
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:29:14
Buy why?
Who is offering this and why ?
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:56:36
This is the lowest volume I have seen on GDAX. Last time it was this low (around 3k) was a month ago when bitcoin started dipping from 9.8k range. 
Does this low volume again mean a dip is coming? I think it does. Any ideas over this?
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:05:34
So now we are taking advice of a drunk person ?
JK. I support btc
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:21
Does this mean most people are just holding their coins? 
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:00:32
Like this post, if you have no clue where btc is heading and feel others also have no clue.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:52:57
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:11:16
Then scare away the sheep 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:05:05
Thats what I am saying. The volume of Indian exchanges is so less then how come people are saying its due to India FUD?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:12:00
Thats a very small wall actually. In a couple of hours BTC would cross 9k easily. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:53:39
And now this : 
I think Jailtey just wanted to buy cheap btc for himself :P
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:25:06
Told you. That was a small wall.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:05:48
Peter Schiff is also kind of anti bitcoin. As per him only gold is the right investment 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:56:46
nah. till yesterday the average volume was 20,000 BTC per day
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:29:17
too many false FUD = CCC (courage, certainty and confidence)
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:26:44
When questioned about exchange hack, he should have told about DEX, ZRX. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:00:06
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:04:22
Look at the low volume.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:52:24
PS: Arun Jaitely is the Finance minister of India
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:56:32
all the TAs on trading view are saying its bearish. like the biggest bears are coming. 
(I want bullish action)
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:29:05
Right now the volume looks fine to me
 Isn't it? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:09:36
where are all those guys who were yelling btc is dead over last 2 3 days? Where are you now? Still feeling the same or feeling FOMO and buying at higher costs? 
BTC wont die. What do you thing what would be the curreny over Mars and Moon? USD!! Thats gonna be crypto my friends
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:33:26
Indian Govt has a long history of not taking calls. They always stall things as long as they can. Our media and politicians take the word 'currency' in cryptocurrency quite literally. They think we want to use cryptos to buy our daily milk and eggs. 
We just want to be able to trade them, and use them as a store of value on the other hand. Journalists are not smart enough at the moment to understand this concept, and politicians are smart enough to keep everything in limbo not really start taxing crypto trading. Some individuals are saying ban the crypto trading and thats what media highlighted, but a couple of individuals doesnt make up the whole govt (just like the recent S Korea FUD)
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:12:23
He means understand the tech. You would be amazed what it can do it future. Invest in the tech not in a random coin
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:18:13
Its already been 60 min and its rising! 
lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:54:31
You have a logic there. (I am no expert)
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:54:26
I have noticed many times, btc falls right at this time. This is the moment when CME market opens I think. Isnt it strange? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:29:11
Right now the volume looks fine to me
 Isn't it? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:27:22
I mean don't just buy a coin if it's rates are going up. Look into the tech and then buy the coin and hold it. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:02:32
One piece of advice to everyone, either be a bull or a bear, don't be a sheep in the crypto world. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:07:09
Some reporters create intentional FUD. Like this one.
All her recent news article were negetive stance on every news that was related to crypto. Now also she is posting the India is 'taking steps' to make crypto illegal. Which is COMPLETELY FALSE. India is trying to make regulations on profits made on crypto, which doesnt make 'crypto illegal'. Is there a way were we can track down such FUD creators and dislike their news articles and push them aside?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:45:05
People get scared when they lose money and get greedy when they make money. And not what people post is always true. Many people intentionally try to fool others. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:10:18
Asians are actually very good HODLers once they realise the power behind the tech. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:57:39
People who really can analyze the BTC pattern or the people who can affect the market, you think they would ever come to this subreddit to ask/give opinions?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:39:38
This will help you : 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:33:50
I have the same doubt. I honestly dont understand the future contracts. Some can please exlain what happened last month and what can happen this time? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:38:29
13,915 BTC
GDAX 24 hour trading volume
I have never seen this low volume
What does this low volume mean?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:05:22
So this can be related to India FUD.
On an Indian Exchange, one of the biggest in India, ZebPay, today 1500 BTC got traded, whereas on a normal day it is usually 500-600 BTC at max. 
But can just 1500 BTC can cause this much damage?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:44:47
Every time someone is selling, someone else is buying at the other end.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:03:57
If the global stock market crashes, how will that impact crypto market?
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:16:50
Shit happens. Now you would HODL smartly. Best of Luck
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:10:24
Always follow one rule in crypto: Never sell at loss. Sooner or later you will get a point where you will make profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:38:54
what does batman mean? Bad or good. Can you please explain little bit
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:46:04
There is no selling pressure. On GDAX, from 10,400 to 11,000 USD only 400 btc are on sell orders. Still why btc is falling!!! WTF
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:32:33
everyone, I am confused. Is Peter Schiff the person who predicted the 2008 crash or was he Michael Burry?
Can some one please tell me about these two guys in short. Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:29:30
shut up redditor for 1 week.
That was the bottom, lucky if you bought it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:43
Buying more btc right now 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:12:47
Thats just 150 BTC. Not a big deal in crypto world
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:46:24
when does the US tax season ends?
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:10:14
bull trap or bear trap?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:50:46
looks like another FUD. There is news that S Korea and China are coming together to promote blockchain and here it says 'complete ban'. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:40:58
Exactly. Media intentionally creating FUD. Now not just the market is crashing, my parents after watching the news are calling me telling me to listen to Jaitley and sell ! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:07:09
HODL it. Buy 5 kidneys at the end of this year. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:21:16
Might be coz of India FUD. I am from India, and trust me govt didn't say exactly what the news is posting. All that the parliament said is that Crypto is not legal tender.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:04:14
Its not directly related to price action. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:15:12
But if 100 people from this page go there and tell her to STFU, it would be fun :)
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:00:01
I hope you are right hehe
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:53:11
Because in a long term such small profit margins would look very small. I used to day trade, but eventually you make the most if you just HOLD and wait. 
Day trade seems fun and easy, even if you can make profit 9 out of 10 times, but that one single big mistake can mess up the whole margin. That's my personal reason for not day trade. You can if you like to.

What does this pump have got to do with USA? A lot of people are saying 'Go America', I didnt get the reason behind it?
Any news?
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:00:57
I think its not 16000, its 8000
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:02:18
btw from where did you get this news?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:51:23
Can someone please tell us why pump all of a sudden? 
Some news or something like that?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:57:50
haha. And we dont want to see that. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:55:07
I also saw that just now. what could be the implications of this ?
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:20:27
Anyone shorting, please can you not do it right at 9000 mark. Sell it at 8900, or 9100 may be. But not EXACTLY at 9000, please :)
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:59:41
go USA . gooo
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:02:11
I have rarely seen such low volumes on coinbase in last 4 months. Its onlt 6500 bitcoin in last 24 hours. Its usually 12-13k when market is down and over 20k when its moving fast. Any reason for this low volume?
