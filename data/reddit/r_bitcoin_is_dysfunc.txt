He won't...although I agree with you.
Even with all his sentencing enhancements, he's not looking at more than 6-7 years, absolute top end of his guidelines.
I just hope they don't designate him to less than a medium security facility. 
Being an ex-cop in a medium or MAXIMUM security federal prison? No fun..I can assure you.
To all you cops reading this (because there are tons lurking here): Take notice. If you want to play rogue...there will be years of you sitting in a 10x6 concrete segregation cell, alone, going literally insane from the solitude. Why? Because in general population you'd last 3 days until people asked for your PSI report/had someone google you and found out you were a dirty cop.
You'd leave prison a fucking basket case. You honestly all deserve it for the harm you knowingly inflict on society with your willfully ignorant behavior.

I bet 20 BTC that we eventually find out that a lot of these "tumbler" services are actually set up by organizations like the US DOJ and similar government organizations.
Proceed with caution.
