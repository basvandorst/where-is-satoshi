The prices seem to remain for an hour when I purchase things.

No,  I was asking for a way to buy them online instantly so I could complete my purchase today.

I'm not interested in savings. Just the thing I needed requires bitcoins. I will know better of the tax fees for next time.

Hey! That's really kind of you. I won't have to walk back down to the bank today! Thanks! Hopefully next time I can math better.

The site I used to buy bitcoins holds the price for 60 minutes. The site I used to purchase goods holds price for 60 minutes. So it works out nicely :)

Hey! CoinLoft was actually the site I used to buy my first bitcoins yesterday. 
The essence of the post was the try and find a way to purchase them instantly. Even if it costs me more. My time is valuable to me, so having to go to the bank and hand money over is a disruption in my day. 
So thanks for helping me get bitcoins. As soon as you have a way to purchase them online (paypal, CC, POLi etc) I will be back!
Edit: I'm aware there would be transaction fees for CC, paypal etc. This is the cost of convenience, and one I would be willing to pay.

Nothing is worthless so long as people believe in it's value. The same as all currency...

He gave me the amount of batching required to prevent me having to drive across town to deposit money into a bank. An uneccessary and appreciated gesture.

Thanks! May I ask why?
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:39:03
Some site do and others don't. The one I had to go to did :(

I'm not at all interestedin terminologies or the meta-bitcoin scene. Just needed a place to get bitcoins instantly and pay online.
