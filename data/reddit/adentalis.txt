Okay Well this makes sense. If Bob sends all his btc to another address, there wont be any money left on the Coffee tx address.
But if he doesnt, the Coffee tx could be included anytime again right.?

I dont understand your answer that much. Quite a technical one I know.
The new chain the 60% person is mining for himself is completly independent of the "real" chain right. From the block onwards the 60% guy is trying to cheat

I dont think so :D
if the whole network has for example a strength of 1 terahash/s (I know thats nothing these days) it takes the whole network in average 10 Minutes to mine a new block - theres a specific Block difficulty at the moment.
And now think of someone who is able to mine with 2 terahash /s and didnt mine before in the network. So this person has in theory 66% (2/3 mining Power).
This person, company or whatever alone would mine a new block every 5 minutes then in the new chain he's trying to make!?

Im not asking for the most profit. Im asking for changing the past - just in theory.
But thanks for your answer

Thanks for the long replies - but for me my question got no real answer so far.
The whitepaper math is for q &lt; 0.5. I did not rewrite/copy the Programm so far and tested it for q &gt; 0.5. Thats the case I want to talk about 
Your not a hypothetical guy I See :D
