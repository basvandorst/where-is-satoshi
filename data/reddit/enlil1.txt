That means I would need 40 BTC to become a millionaire. BRB, gotta buy 'em bitcoins.

I meant "right now".
Sorry for the confusion.

Your "My BTC Worth" column in the summary section also looks wrong. Seems like for some reason it did not copy correctly. The code for that (cell J5) should be `=PRODUCT(H5:I5)`.

Can you share the file with me. It seems something happend when you copied it that seems to have messed it up.

I'm already done with this! Although I haven't gotten around to update the blank copy yet, so you have to copy the one with the sample data and then clear the data out to use your own.
I'm gonna update the clear version after I finish my next update which will update the cost field to an estimate if you had left it blank.
How I Made it Work? (tech-side)
I used the formula thanatosvn found. The formula basically calls an api that finds the price of a btc at a given date and returns the answer in JSON format. It then uses a regex to only print out the cost.
The first step I did was to "build" the URL I was going to call which was ` So I had to use the DATEVALUE() and MONTH()/DAY()/YEAR() functions to get the respectable date from the date column. I also found out that the api required the month and day to be in 2 digit format, so every time I had to find the month/day, I had to check the length and add a leading zero if required. After I built the string, all I did was to use `DOLLAR()` to convert the answer to dollars (or the user's locale currency). I then copied the cells all the way to row ~1000, since I found out that ARRAYFORMULA (a function that repeats your formula for every row) is not compatible with the IMPORTDATA function.

Done! :)

Don't worry lol. No virus here. If you want to be safe, how 'bout use your phone and connect it to a different wifi network.

Can you click on the the first cell with " and paste the code here?
Or you can also share it temporarily and pm me the link and I'll try to fix it. Whichever you want, I don't mind.

lmfao, hopefuly your not scared of [Imgur](

Just interested... who got hacked with a Google Sheets link? Do you still have the link to the article?
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:54:46
Currently I'm implementing a feature where it will automatically find the value of a btc at a given date. After I'm done with that. I'll see if I can make an excel version. If I succeed I'll send you it! :-)

Wish I saw this before I signed up and gave them my bank account. I'm only 18, I got no utility bills in my name.
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:36:18
It does!
After you fill out the amount you purchased and how much you payed, it automatically calculates that field for you.

Being a computer science major, that "hack" is really easy. It's just phishing. The bad guy sent an official looking email to the guy that seemed to be from Google. When the person clicked on the link it wasn't actually google docs but the hackers website at which he entered his account credentials.

Oh you're using Excel. Ya it won't work in excel cause I'm using code such as `=importdata` which is only available on Google Sheets to automatically get the current price of a bitcoin. The net gain though would work but that means you have to manually update the price of 1 bitcoin for the data to be correct. Also the net gain seems to be working in the excel file you sent me.
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:27:56


When you copied the spreadsheet, did you go to File &gt; Make a copy. Or did you just copy and paste all the cells?
Do this. Select the entire column and click the delete key. Then select F5 (should be the first cell under Net Gain) and paste the following code: `=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(ISBLANK(C5:C),"",C5:C*H5-E5:E))`
Also just to make sure, clear all cells in column D, and select the first cell under "Price/BTC" (D5) and paste the following code: `=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(C5:C=0,"",E5:E/C5:C))`

Thank you! I was just looking around for API's/forumlas. I'll implement it soon.
