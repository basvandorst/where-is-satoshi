laundering money is fucking easy. funnel it through a fake business and turn it into real money. Wash what you need under a fake guise of "ebay business" for day to day use as you set up a front corporation (since it's half a billion dollars you will have to wash)

Restaurants don't use armored cars normally. They just drive one of those locking zipper purses to the bank. And it's not just an employee, it's a manager and they are directly on the hook for it. You aren't sending your undocumented dishwasher jesus with the 10 thousand dollar purse to the bank. If you are, you're too stupid to implement bitcoin.

Something that people are focusing too much on is explaining a bitcoin. I'm talking about explaining the math of how the crime would work so you could prove a crime took place. A judge isn't going to be helped in rendering a decision knowing about the philosophical underpinnings of this Bitcoin thing.
THIS IS THE ENTIRE PROBLEM WITH MT GOX RIGHT NOW
No one can even explain how the coins were stolen. Or even IF they were stolen. But they most assuredly were fucking stolen and the number one suspect with a fucking bullet is Mark Karpeles.

i don't mean is a programmer or worked at radio shack for a summer in the 80s. Middle America, people who install the Ask Toolbar every week. My office is full of people who work on computers all day but don't understand how to send an attachment in outlook. People who can instagram and shapchat all day but run to the boss when they see me putting a thumbdrive in a computer because they think that's the only place viruses come from. This is how most people are. The average person isn't sitting in a starbucks in NYC cleaning up a spreadsheet on their thinkpad. They are riding the bus in some bumfuck suburb in kansas.

They are mixing up prepaid gift type cards and a secured credit card. Secured credit card is one that you load an amount of cash onto that you then borrow from yourself. Sorta. It's like baby's first credit card and there is no credit check for them but they do build credit.

like fud. your fake corp accepts bitcoin. tumble the coins. then, incoming payments come from a new wallet address each time and are immediately sold through coinbase.

Broad response, not directed at op directly:
To quote George Carlin, "Think about how stupid the average person is, and realize that half the population is even dumber than them"
It's that there is no precedent. They didn't steal software. They didn't take money. It has no physical location. People attribute value to it so it must be something. This is not the same thing as hacking someone's scottrade account and taking all their stock. It's much closer to hacking someone's EVE account and taking all their ISK. ISK is a virtual currency, It has a clearly defined monetary value, the global amount of it can be kept track of in a ledger. It's actually almost the same amount of difficulty to sell ISK for USD and buy a taco with it. 
I understand what the concept of bitcoin is and how to use it as a money or a store of wealth or any of the other practical things that it's still in the extremely early stages of using. But I've followed it from day 1 pretty much and still can't get my wife to understand how it's not a scam. The very notion of it to the masses sounds like a ponzi scheme. 
Take off the rose colored glasses of an in the know bitcoin user and look at the world that has no idea what the fuck a bitcoin is.

I missed the old protest but a half million a month isn't unheard of at all for a good restaurant. 
The shitty pizza hut in my town was a 2 million a year store and wasn't that busy. 6 million a year for a popular college town restaurant/bar sounds right.

BECAUSE THEY STOLE IT.
Bitcoin is brand new. It's hard to indict in front of stodgy old judges who still haven't grasped programming a VCR let alone operating a smartphone. The more hand waving and scrambling they do the more clearly they get away. Try to explain the blockchain to a 60 year old who doesn't have a tech background. You might as well be speaking Farsi. 
If the Wright brothers started robbing banks the week after their first flight they never would have been caught. No one would have known what to do.

It's exactly the same thing when explaining money to a child. My 4 year old says a maseratti costs 64 dollars and I would have to work for 6 days to make that much money. THAT is pulling arbitrary numbers and symbols out of thin air. In the real world there is a global consensus of how much a dollar can buy. There are hundreds of agencies, corporations, governments, universities that study it by the microsecond to adjust the value accordingly. 
The definition of money and how it works is fucking simple. Determining the value is hard. I need a taco but don't have time to make one. Billy makes tacos but doesn't need what I can make. I trade a globally recognized iou worth 1 taco that I traded earlier for what my skill is. Now everyone has something they can use and trade further.

Ok,  say they sell 5million day one.  That's almost half the current stock of coins. That would make the price skyrocket then collapse as they convert the coins into something they can pay the light bill with

These asic makers are halfway between fly-by-night and strike while the iron is hot. Their companies cannot last forever and will not be bought out by a bigger fish. Customer service and reputation don't matter when you won't exist 2 years from now. 
If they fuck with you, don't let them collect the money.
