How do you go from "we can’t penetrate encryption, that’s a problem" to banning math?
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:28:46
Funny how r/bitcoiners will say banning bitcoin is like banning banning math, guns, or pens, yet in their next breath they say bitcoin will end the nation state.
Are people here implying bitcoin is as harmless and common as water, or are they saying it is the most unstoppable powerful weapon in history?

That is a slightly better analogy but you have to accommodate for both the probability and cost.
The probability of the event occurring, and the cost to the terrorists target (note that there can be huge cultural costs from terrorism).
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:28:14
It could be.
I suspect whatever comes after the digital age/processing systems will be something universal.

And uranium is a "branch" of ores, which means it is ore.
In the context of terrorism and extremism; it doesn't matter if it is a rock, book, or software.

The OP mentions 3 revolutions but it's actually the same revolution... the rise of the digit/bit.
You have heard of the pen beating the sword, now the digit beats the pen.
In other words it's; sword &gt; sword/pen &gt; pen &gt; pen/digit &gt; digit.
Don't think of it as one beating another rather it is a hierarchy with most people using (one day) bitcoin/digits but everyone still has a healthy respect for gold and swords (and pens). In other words the foundation is swords but every uses the digit/bit.
Both the dollar and bitcoin has both abstract values (pens) and processing systems (the blockchain). Money is more abstract centric, and bitcoin is more processing centric.
You could say that it is; gold &gt; gold/dollar &gt; dollar &gt; dollar/bitcoin &gt; bitcoin.

I'm also hoping *Hardblock* and *Australian bitcoin ATM's* will come back online soon.
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:29:35
I agree it is confusing.
If they gave an example for a private person (not registered for GST) exchanging $AUD for bitcoin to use as a digital currency then it would be clearer (but they don't).
The example you quote is for Karin who is registered for GST and is using the bitcoin as business asset purchase.

Very good, now we are getting somewhere.
We just have to balance your left leaning arguments with the people the that run the show (they are usually right leaning).
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:19:22
So you are clarifying your statement that encryption is not math, but rather encryption is a type of math.
In that case I can clarify my statement that a hammer is not just a rock, but rather a hammer is a type of iron ore.
Do you have a problem regulating uranium ore exports to countries with a history of religious political violence or no separation of religion and state?
Can you see the both the probability of a bomb and cost to the West regarding uranium ore exports? Maybe encryption is the 21st centuries uranium ore.

That's like saying a cartoon is just ink, or a hammer is just a rock/iron ore.
Clearly nobody is banning math, ink, or rocks (and the article doesn't say that encryption should be banned). They are trying to find a way to work with the inventions of our digital age. 
The left wing and right wing can use inventions for terror yet reddit only 'sees and upvotes' whatever young radically progressive twenty year olds want to see.

Implementing what? 
I asked what things I should connect to bitcoin/internet and Mitchr4 just said "internet things"?
It's like asking what a person likes, and the person replies "stuff".

You can start by using Windows Powershell (free software from Microsoft) to read the blockchain via a JSON feed from helloblock.io, blockr.io (best), or blockchain.info (worst).
The Powershell command would be:


... which would download the details of the address into a text file on your computer called BitcoinBalance.txt. You then program Powershell to read the text file and run your arduino when the balance increases.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:12:01
Can you be more specific?
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:38:03
Hmm, nice job so far. Perhaps I could setup a webcam on my ceiling and draw a map on the floor. Payment to a bitcoin address does ??? I could put a Green/Orange/Red LED in each square or something...

The "physical tank paintball game controllable online" in the 2nd link sounds good.

When quadcopters get cheaper I would like to automate a tennis ball delivery system (drones fitted with webcams and Open Street Mapping) to the exercise grounds at my local dog pound.

I could do the same thing with a really good sex doll but that sounds more sad and not my thing.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:44:25
I'm hoping that;
* GPS, or
* webcams that recognize a chessboard-painted roof...
... will be available soon at a low cost and that could solve most the missing drone problems.
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:03:53
Good idea. I don't know anyone who would have access to such things but I could do the same thing with a box trailer, ute, or van.
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:47:55
At the moment I use a PHP script to check my address balances every hour but your method sounds easier rather than editing multiple lines of code every bitcoin address change.

Dogs are in cages and 2 minutes from my house.
I don't take food from Africans everyday, but I bet you pay money towards keeping factory farmed animals in cages everyday.
I am mad at the vast majority of humans but for the actual harm they do to animals rather than some abstract privileged checking equality biased ideology.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:47:03
Thanks for the idea (the legit dice part).
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:05:06
That sounds easier than my 10 pin bowling idea in my OP.
Edit: maybe not as I don't know how to read the dice result.
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:39:26
Something like this would be good at a dog shelter as well. People could buy treats for the dogs and the dogs would get exposure to possible new families looking for a dog.

Castrated factory farmed animals are nice (taste wise) to eat.
That's why most the people here will have diabetes or pre-diabetes at 50 years old, and comments like yours will justify human nursing farms to manage your illness.
You are what you eat.
