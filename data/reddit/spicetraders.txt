Or it goes up more, you get a margin call, lose your house. Then your family is living under a bridge

That's hilarious because my wife always asks me if I'm having fun playing my Bitcoin as if it's a game and you just respawn when you die

Nice reference!

Well it's not a silver bar, so it will have less buying power when you pull it out. How is that a wise investment?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:58:28
But it counts up instead of down

Thsy use inflation to fuck us over now. Try putting a hundred bucks under a floor board for 20 years, and then pull it out and spend it. You'll be pissed off. Guaranteed

That's what the random words are for. Revovery. Keep them secure because they are the keys to your wallet, and anyone can recover YOUR funds to THEIR wallet if they have your keys

I love my TREZOR, and trust the company. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:02:28
Get a wallet app like Jaxx or something for now, send your bitcoin to it. Order a Trezor online for longer term storage

This is why I HODL

I was you just 5 weeks ago. I started reading articles about Bitcoin, got a Coinbase account, put in 100 bucks, joined reddit, started reading white papers, found an exchange I like, traded for diversity, blah blah blah. The point is that for 100 bucks, I have learned a lot, gotten my feet wet, and am buying coin every 2 weeks. Crypto will forever be some percentage of my portfolio because I did start somewhere.

Im doing as much as my wife will let me. It doesnt matter how much really. What matters is putting in an amount you wouldn't be mad about losing. Between making coffee at home and packing a sack lunch, my wife lets go of 100 every 2 weeks.

I have been divorced twice before my current marriage. I still side with u/daguito81 in that if you can't go all in 100% with your spouse, youre already setting your relationship up for failure.

Out of all of Bob's daily transactions, how many do you think will be in crypto? If Bob suddenly can't pay his bills because of that transaction, he's in the wrong business
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:57:31
Until you withdraw to fiat, there is no profit. Only loss. Even then, a p2p exchange at the local coffee shop is hard to track
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:47:01
1. No. The seed recovers your wallet regardless of how many transactions have taken place.
2. Hot wallets should only store what you want to trade with. Any funds you want to keep safe should go into a wallet you control the private keys for. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure.
3. I have seen BTM machines with 10% fees for buying and selling.  If you buy one BTC then sell that BTC you will have lost over $1000 to fees at most of the BTMs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Which is horrible since you can ACH transfer from a bank account to GDAX and buy BTC and transfer to a Trezor wallet for next to nothing. Hopefully others can give more info about BTMs as I have only poked around a BTM finder website, and don't have experience using the machines.
4. I like to leave miner fees and gas cost (for Etherium transactions) at the default settings for most situations because too low makes transactions take for ever to confirm, too high and you waste money on snappy confirmations. Obviously, sometimes it may be necessary to ensure a fast transaction. 
I hope this helps you!
