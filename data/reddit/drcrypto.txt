Sadly, not many, but we should.
I'm glad this kind of services exist, but it might be wise for ClearTracks to sort it out before all bitcoin services really get under heavy scrutiny. The banking lobby LOVES to tell the regulators that bitcoin is mainly used for funding terrorism and money laundering, which fortunately can be proven wrong.
Now is not the time to give them real examples of how bitcoin can be used for tax evasion.

Wow, great! I'll certainly take a closer look later today and maybe gladly accept your help to list my products in a few days. As this project is open-source, what is your business model? Do you intend to host a marketplace and charge a certain fee? If so, how much do you have in mind? Also, if I start listing things on the "official site that hasn't launched yet", will they still be on when it actually launches? Thank you!
EDIT: So I think the interface is quite nice, however maybe should you also add an option to display the corresponding price in USD or other currencies just as an indicator?

Alright, just created an account to see how things look like.
Got some PHP errors, nothing that prevents me from creating an account / logging in, but you may want to fix it: 
Also the email validation link is broken: HTML href command is not interpreted correctly, and the "alternative" link is directly followed (without space) with "and", so you cannot just click and confim.

If you're buying groceries at the supermarket, ZERO confirmation is basically enough in most cases, as the probability the transaction is finally rejected is ultra low.
As for the online merchants, they don't really care about these 40 minutes if it's for high-value purchases, it will take days for them to be delivered to you by mail anyway. And if it's low-value, zero confirmation is usually enough, again.
If all you said was true, how come basically no store accepts litecoin while refusing bitcoin?

I'm a big fan of Shapeshirt, but I'm curious, where do you get your liquidity? My first thought was that you kept some money on exchanges in order to net a profit by charging a premium over whatever it actually costs you to do the trade. However, such an approach exposes you to the risk that whatever exchange you use collapses.
Knowing that Cryptsy used to be a major exchange for altcoins (therefore a good source of liquidity) but seeing that your service didn't seem to suffer much from its downfall over the past months, what is your secret? :D

Do you even know what you're talking about, dude? NO ONE ever distributes LaTeX sources for public consumption (unless it's a collaborative documentation project or something), because it is impossible to read naturally (and it's not meant to). Do you know what LaTeX users distribute eventually? Compiled PDF files.
The comment above wasn't about why OP didn't post the .tex file (because seriously no one would care - just like giving away a .docx file for Word), it was about why that so-called 'paper' hadn't been edited with LaTeX (which is truly the only accepted typesetting software for anything serious in math-related disciplines in academia) rather than Word.
Oh, by the way, do you know what the bitcoin white paper was edited with?

OK, I understand why time travel jokes are upvoted, but why is OP downvoted so much? Come on guys, the mistake is funny but it's an important problem if OP's story is legit, which it seems to be as a guy from said company reached out on reddit. Which is a good thing, but it's totally alarming that they have kept OP in the dark for two weeks over a thousand dollars.
Or is it minus one month and a half?

This news is actually more important than it seems, knowing that Pokerstars accepts Neteller, making it pretty straightforward to deposit money on the biggest mainstream gambling site using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:49:28
Not sure about now, but blockchain.info has a history of neglecting security and not fixing known bugs affecting customers' funds. I guess it's still okay just as a temporary solution, but OP is much better off downloading an SPV wallet if he considers the amount he has in bitcoin non trivial.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:32:11
I meant the fact that Neteller now charges 5% per deposit! But yeah, you're right, I've also taken advantage of the 0% deposit previously :)
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:15:38
It's actually ridiculous he HAS to send a request and that you didn't notify your customers before implementing such an important change.

Hey Otoh,


At this point, I'm afraid it doesn't show that they are actively trying to fix the issues. My guess is that they are insolvent and have been for a while, and the little money you manage to recover from time to time only comes from other users, who will in turn have trouble withdrawing :/
@_date: 2015-11-27 03:30:55
You could always buy it on Amazon with bitcoin and purse.io ;)
@_date: 2015-10-21 10:56:56
I had been a fully verified user for a year or so, indeed due to withdrawal limitations for non-verified users, which was a legitimate demand from Cryptsy. However, withholding funds from fully verified users and ignoring support tickets is another whole problem...
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:27:33
OP's point is to make sure that addresses are copied correctly, for which verifying the first and last characters pretty much guarantee that the middle is fine too if copied all at once.
Making sure the service doesn't substitute addresses is another whole problem. If the dev is going to try and fool you, it would be equally "trivially easy" to display the full address you entered while substituting it with a completely different one in the background.
@_date: 2015-10-22 01:55:21
You're right, I also think that with a reasonable person, being polite will make them want to help you. On another hand, if the other person is dishonest and is trying to steal as much as possible, I think being too gentle may let them buy time while asking you to wait more, while threatening to make it public can make them decide they'd rather let you go than risking their whole operation.
My point is that both strategies can be valid In that specific case, and I think we can agree that even the most impolite customers should not have their property arbitrarily withheld without a reasonable explanation. Because that is theft.

I am a user (it's free!), and their end-to-end encrypted email service is really great.

@_date: 2016-05-10 00:04:41
Blockchain.info has a history of not fixing known bugs that led to fund loss, sometimes considerable, for a lot of users. See for instance [1]( [2](
If you have "a lot" of bitcoin (enough that it would bother you if you lost everything), I think you're better off keeping most of your funds locally (on your computer, with backups and all) and just keep some pocket change on your phone.
@_date: 2015-10-21 05:55:12
OP probably initially thought only the date was important when he posted the picture on other subreddits before trying We figured out later on that the amount might actually be relevant (it seems Cryptsy specifically targets high value accounts while still processing more modest withdrawals, probably so most people don't notice what's going on).
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:02:44
I see. Maybe others can suggest alternative web wallets (maybe with ~~Coinbase~~ or Circle if you don't care about not controlling your private keys), but if you really want to give blockchain.info, I'd recommend not only writing down your username and password carefully, but also immediately download the private keys as soon as possible.
There has been reports of other bugs, but the threads I linked discussed the fact that sometimes you could lose access to your wallets after logging out. At least, downloading the private keys ASAP will mitigate that risk.
**Edit:** Removed Coinbase, forgot the point of your thread was that your account was being closed!
@_date: 2015-10-15 03:10:47
I'm sorry I can't answer your question directly, but if you really have an important amount of bitcoin (from your perspective), you may want to get what you intend to hold for a while out of Coinbase (or any centralised service in general) and move it to cold storage, or at least to a wallet you fully control.
While Coinbase is definitely one of the more reliable companies out there (and I use it), you should generally avoid storing significant amounts on services that can arbitrarily freeze your funds, or be hacked.
EDIT: Coinbase itself doesn't actually need to be hacked for you to lose your funds, your computer's security may be compromised by a keylogger, same goes with your smartphone, while there are good practice guidelines you can follow to generate secure bitcoin wallets.
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:53:34
Oh, I perfectly agree with you. I was just pointing out that the OP just blacked out everything in his first upload, and didn't bother making a new screenshot when he revealed how much he had "lost".
I also understand blacking out everything in an attempt to warn the community without making him trivially recognizable by the Cryptsy team, as they could retaliate by definitely freezing his account (I guess they wouldn't have too much trouble finding which account has a withdrawal on hold for an "uncommon" number like 21.23481).
On another hand, it would be completely trivial to fake a screenshot to display 21 rather than 0.21, so it shouldn't actually be an important factor to decide if the story is legit or not.

While I agree with you that Switzerland has a history of being protective with financial information, [things are changing]( Also, regardless of Switzerland's position on bitcoin, we can perfectly imagine that some day, the USA (or any other country) passes a law requiring ShapeShift (or any other crypto company) to give their transaction records to the goverment if they want to be allowed to operate there.

Genuinely curious, what are the benefits of gandi.net over name.com (or other registrars for that matter) that make you think it's "worth it"?
I usually get my domains with OVH and had to get one with Gandi.net recently (only available there for some reason), and not only was is more expensive, I also got less options than with OVH (no free email address without a hosting plan, and no free hosting plan, even tiny).

It's great for you that support reacted after only 2h and guided you through the proper steps.
Unfortunately for OP, support is apparently still not responding after 48h (and I guess he sent other messages since then)...
By the way, how many coins did you withdraw, if I may ask?
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:33:18
What you're saying is true, but the problem here is even worse: Cryptsy will let you deposit, but will, for some users, raise every possible obstacle to prevent them from withdrawing.

Posting here to say that I had 10 BTC detained there for 48 hours a month or so ago. Fortunately I was finally able to get my coins back eventually, by spamming support and threatening to make it public right away, but it is possible that Cryptsy specifically targets high-value accounts, while still processing lower trades normally. That way, the average Joe, not experiencing any problem, could claim that this is all just FUD. What better scamming strategy than turning users against others before they notice it, anyway?
@_date: 2015-10-16 05:33:59
