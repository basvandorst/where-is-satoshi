libertyx is great for folks without a bank account, though, if i remember right, they do ask for ID. maybe it's not 100% required? i'm not positive..

it's not just you. most people don't get it. at least you're not angrily posting about how much of a waste of money it is, without fully understanding it, like some folks around here.
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:46:56
nope, you made those numbers up in your head

@_date: 2015-12-03 00:09:51


most of the negative reviews are by people who didn't even get one at all, and are just trying to scream and yell about how expensive it is. [see here](


less than a dozen, eh? is that a number you made up?
the 21 device was the  top seller in servers on amazon for days. it's still at  you can't do that by selling less than a dozen devices. i've seen more than a dozen people talking about how stoked they are about theirs. please stop spreading misinformation that you pulled out of your ass
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:06:59
there's a post like this every few days. you're def not the first, and won't be the last.
if you still have funds there, i'd find a way to move 'em asap. some folks reported better success withdrawing altcoins, instead of bitcoin. you can get them converted back to bitcoin on another exchange or shapeshift.io, if you so desire
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:25:17
i know you fail to see the advantage. you don't have to, because others do. let them be devs and help develop this technology so that 21 and the inevitable competitors can make a mass-producible cost-effective product
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:43:57
i never said thousands of people are buying these. i said more than half a dozen. you're continuing to make up numbers...
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:51:11
for the most part, yes. more specifically, they fail to see the bigger picture of a product like this in the context of what has happened in the past. they're stuck on the idea that the purpose of a device like this is to mine bitcoin for fiat value.
that's alright. there's already a handful of very capable individuals who do get it. they are getting involved and innovating, actually doing something instead of yelling on message boards. i believe we'll see plenty of innovation well before a mass-produced 21inc product, because of these individuals.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:29:20
yeah, i was being a bit reactionary. apologies
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:45:03
I agree with most of what you said. However, I can't really see how it's the voter's fault if they were being lied to. Wouldn't that put the root cause in the hands of the liars? Seems to me that the average voter needs to become aware of the constant stream of lies flowing out of Washington (and most of its orifices) for anything to truly change. Turn off your television. Get rid of that piece of garbage before it completely brainwashes you and your loved ones. Sources of honest information are incredibly widespread nowadays, and so are sources of lies to a similar degree. People have the ability to know truth, yet they can still go down a rabbit hole of lies. A simple point in the right direction might be the necessary first step down the path of truth for many people

i'm so glad you posted about your business on reddit. i had been thinking recently about ways to assist my friend while he is off helping his dad improve his land outside of hilo. i think he would really appreciate a few edibles for the landscape, and perhaps the beginnings of a kitchen garden. the bitcoin part is a no-brainer too, since i'm not in hawaii myself. also a great bridging of communities. thanks for posting!
@_date: 2016-02-22 05:33:47
near hilo, by chance? i have a friend who is living there right now.
do you have a list of what you sell?

yeah, wtf? makes so much sense. i bet we'll see something like this in the not too distant future

that would be centralized

it's not mining to sell the satoshis for fiat on an exchange. i'm guessing you didn't read the editorial or the 21inc website.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:39:07
i guess we'll see..
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:49:38
people are posting a lot about it lately because it just came out
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:15:27
it's at least encouraging competition. pretty soon, another company will probably come out with a cheaper open-source alternative. i'm sure tutorials will come out that explain how to do everything for less money on a pi. these are all great things. i don't get why it's so hard for everyone to see how much of a positive impact this is going to make
@_date: 2015-11-13 18:45:09

@_date: 2015-11-20 19:41:47
wonderful! that's exactly what i'm talking about. the ball is rolling. keep up the good work
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:02:41
a pi can do everything the 21 computer does...once you buy and set up mining hardware, download bitcoin core, download the entire blockchain, etc. these things can take **days** to get up and running properly, let alone running smoothly. this is not an exaggeration.
21 is offering a complete plug-and-play kit, ready to go. the high price keeps the quantity of production low (on 21's end) for this sneak-peak kind of kit. it's not meant for you. no worries. a product for the masses is in the works.
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:38:36
^ this
especially this:


@_date: 2015-11-18 20:06:05
i don't think this product is a good introduction for non-bitcoiners. the learning curve is too steep. the company plans on coming out with products for the masses in the future. this product is meant for people who use the command line on a regular basis
@_date: 2015-11-18 05:08:04
a normal raspberry pi 2 draws about 5 watts. to put that in perspective, an incandescent lightbulb is something like 60-75 watts.
i power my pi with a small 7 watt solar panel attached to a 4xAA battery charger. works like a charm, in the daytime. i'm hoping to upgrade to a rechargeable lithium battery in the near future.
edit: according to the amazon page, it consumes 15 watts (5 volts * 3 amps)
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:12:03
it's not mining so that you could sell the bitcoin for fiat. there's other companies that make those products.
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:39:00
i'm aware of that post. that's how to install the software that comes with the 21 comptuter. it's really not much of a tutorial, despite the title. you'd still need to download the blockchain, at least. plus, you'd also need mining hardware, and setting that up has it's own steps.
and anyway, what i meant is that when there are use case tutorials from developers using the 21inc device, people will inevitably make rpi tutorials for the same use cases. an example might be a tutorial to setup an off-grid tor proxy server that is funded by micropayments.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:56:35
What payment method are you looking to use?
I've made a few cash purchases through LibertyX (usually in increments of $50). They have a pretty good coverage of CA, and new places show up on their map every so often

the machines performing the proof of work are distributed in homes and offices around the globe. how is that not decentralized?
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:01:17
maybe 2 watts when it's not doing much. if it was mining bitcoin, i bet that'd be another story.
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:25:07
don't be preachy, confusing, or go off on too much of an excited rant. these things are easy to do when talking about disruptive, exciting, and somewhat confusing new technologies and ideas, such as bitcoin/Bitcoin.
i just start out by pointing out a way bitcoin can benefit one of my relatives. after that, i just let them inquire further, if they so desire. as long as i don't bewilder the ever living shit out of them, it usually ends up going pretty well.
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:50:00
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:35:21
people are excited about bitcoin. doesn't seem strange to me.
yes, people could make a bitcoin computer out of a pi, mining hardware, and a lot of time. it took me many days to download the entire blockchain on my less-than-optimal internet connection. it took me days to learn how to do a lot of things on my pi. this company is offering a complete package, full node, miner, dev kit, preinstalled and ready to go, for people who have an extra few hundred dollars to throw around. i'm not going to buy it, and niether should you. it's not meant for you.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:29:20
i believe your pi can do everything this device can do, *if* you have already invested in the equipment necessary to mine bitcoin. what this company is selling is a complete package, like a rpi starter kit for bitcoin geeks, ready to mine and be a full node and run bitcoin related programs that haven't even been imagined yet.
you know what, it would be great if a company came out with a 21inc competitor, by just making inexpensive bitcoin mining shields for inexpensive yet powerful devices like rpi, beagle bone, odroid, etc. shit's just getting more powerful, more accessible, and people are just barely realizing the potential. i truly believe this is just the beginning. just sit back and watch the glory unfold. or find out how to do all this cool shit on a pi and share it with the world. no matter what, great things are on the horizon
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:20:51
i'm not buying one. i have a pi. i spent the days it took setting a bunch of shit up, like downloading bitcoind, downloading the entire blockchain, etc. i don't have mining hardware, so i cant mine unless i invest more money. i'm going to continue to learn about coding and bitcoin with the resources i have available to me. and so should you. make a cheap rig with a pi. this is not a bad thing.
the high price barrier keeps the demand regulated. mostly people who are super stoked will be buying them, while the masses talk shit. people who understand will innovate, weather that's on a 21 computer or a pi. either way, it's good for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-20 20:21:49
the entire unit is $400. you're exaggerating to further your argument

@_date: 2015-11-19 21:44:21
how so? i just said that people will use this device to innovate, others will use cheaper alternatives, like a regular raspberry pi, and that the existence of products like this are important for the evolution of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-18 00:29:22
very interesting!




@_date: 2015-11-18 22:30:07
good luck finding a $25 pi. (buying used?)
the $120 hardware wallets were a necessary first step. they were good for bitcoin. this will lead to cheaper alternatives. this is good for bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-19 21:26:59
actually, this post was made in response to the masses of shortsighted posts that were (and still are) littering this sub. people who don't get it are angrily posting about how awful it is that individuals are spending their money on this product (as if trolls actually cared about the other people's best interests), without even understanding what it does. *you* see that this is paving the way for innovation. not everyone can see that. they take their misunderstanding and turn it into anger. i just wish people would see that this device is good for bitcoin, even if they wouldn't pay $400 for such a thing.
