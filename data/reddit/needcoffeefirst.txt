I agree. This is an important decision they are making that puts my finances at risk, yet I had to stumble across this thread to find out. They have our email addresses ffs... why not notify us directly??
Now I have my BTC loaned out for an extended period of time, and theoretically could lose everything.

You can create QR codes from you seed using an offline QR code generator (there are online ones but obviously that's a bad idea).
If you have a 3D printer, you could print the QR code on to the surface of a polymer block (or print the reverse so you can use it as an ink-stamp). You could even print it inside a cavity which you have to cut/break open to access it. This would be water resistant, but not be fire-resistant, of course.

Buy some dog-tags and some alpha-numeric letter punches and stamp parts of your Trezor seed on to multiple tags. 
Give one part of the seed to your lawyer, one to your parents, keep others in separate safety deposit boxes etc.
Then tell your lawyer or next of kin how to access them in case of your death.

I want to run a possible hypothetical scenario by you guys....
A quick online search revealed that PayPal allow buyer charge-backs up to 45 days, but some credit card providers allow 180 days (I may well be wrong about that). Also, I've read that PayPal don't like people dealing cryptos via their platform, so tend to side with the buyer in disputes.
What if you "loaned" (i.e. sold) 100 BTC over 6 months, then your PayPal account was suddenly hit with many charge-backs for all the $ you received for the BTC?
This would only be possible if all the "borrowers" were the same person/group, so would have to involve xcoins.io themselves. I'm not at all implying that they are crooks - I'm just considering worst case scenarios...

I've been using them (as a lender) for about 3 weeks now and I'm cautiously optimistic now. I've sold around $2k worth of BTC and made a net profit of around 12% after all costs are considered, even though I've deliberately kept my sales limits low (see  below). These are just my experiences so far, so ymmv.
The main concerns to keep in mind are:
**1. Counter party risk** - I never keep more than 0.5 BTC on the site to limit my exposure.
**2. PayPal charge-backs** - unavoidable, though relatively low. I haven't had one yet (after maybe 30 transactions), but others on the forums have, so I'm expecting some soon. The ratio should be low enough to keep you in profit and xCoins now have a 50% profit guarantee program (they automatically refund some CBs to ensure you make a profit).
**3. PayPal account closure/limiting** - BTC activity is considered 'risky' by PP; too many CBs or a rapid spike in sales volume may cause PayPal to flag your account for investigation. This is very rare IMO, but worth considering. Start with small volumes and increase slowly (thereby mimicking a small growing business).
xCoins are looking into other payment processors atm, so hopefully PayPal will no longer be an issue soon. As always, start small and do your research. 
xCoins fees are relatively high, but are paid by the buyer. However, you can get up to 25% of your fees discounted forever by using the following promotion code when registering: **jbh184**

It does actually work... but it's not perfect yet.
I've been using xCoins for nearly a month now. It's not a bad system - and you can fully automate your *lending with minimal input for 15% ROI on all BTC passed through the system.
Charge-backs are indeed an issue and can wipe out your profits. However, xCoins have recently introduced a scheme where they automatically cover all losses due to charge-backs/fraud until you are back to at least 50% profit. This can be considered insurance, designed to cover any early stage *lenders who are unlucky enough to hit get with a charge-back early on, prior to making much profit. xCoins say most people who have been using the system for a while are in profit anyway as the CB rate is quite low.
Other risks include PayPal closing your account due to "high risk" activities. This risk is decreasing with time, I think, as PP now has relationships with Coinbase etc. now and seem to be softening their stance on BTC. Still, it's recommended to start *lending in low volumes, and slowly increase it so as not to raise flags/alarms. Also, don't withdraw big sums from PP immediately - always leave enough $ in the PP account to cover possible CBs - this will goes some way to re-assuring PP.
I know that it is a top priority of xCoins to find another payment processor that is more BTC friendly and doesn't allow CBs (or at least provides better seller protection), but in the meantime 15% ROI on all BTC that you sell via xCoins is (to me) worth the risks that I mentioned above.
Finally... counter-party risk. As always, don't store lots coins on the exchange. Transfer and start *lending. Replenish balance when empty.
*Note: I say "lenders". As r/novemberhigh said, it's a facade. You are "lending" your BTC for the full $ cost +15% premium in an indefinite "loan". In reality, it's a sale. I expect that there are legal/regulatory reasons for this.
xCoins seems legit, and there's potential for an easy profit - but start with small volumes, assess the risk/reward ratio, read the forums and decide for yourself.
Oh, and use the following promo code when joining up for up to 25% off commission fees: **jbh184**

'Example 2' is what will happen to lenders on Poloniex.
On Bifinex, 'example 1' will happen.
