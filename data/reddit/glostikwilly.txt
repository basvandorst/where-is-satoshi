Yeah i agree, i think if whoever gets the coins, holds the coins, it wouldnt change but if they immediately dump them that might cause some kind of fireworks... maybe

Ok here is a run down for now while I am on my phone I will put as much as I can.  
 We are Indiana band Glostik Willy.  Most of our fan base is in Ohio so we are throwing our festival in the Cincinnati area the weekend of July 4.  I already have everything paid for as far as production, and I am looking now for a headliner budget.  I have been playing with the band for 12 years we have thrown several festivals in the past.  Our management company is AlchemyHouse Presents.  They have over 20 years in the industry throwing festivals.  Check out the Werk Out Music festival, my management built that festival.  
One headliner I have paid for is Randy and Lahey from Trailer Park Boys will be there doing a 1 hr comedy show and hosting a cheeseburger picnic in the afternoon.  I am looking for help with a band budget to secure a good national act.  I will tell you a little about our band and what we stand for.
We are a band of brothers. Two of us are actual brothers (guitar and drums) and our bassist has been our best friend and in our band for 13 years.  We currently tour all around the country, we actually leave tomorrow for a Carolina tour.  We have been rising above all bands above us and are now headlining festivals and shows across the country.  Our biggest thing we stand for is being real people with our fans.  We never ever ever leave a show without hanging and talking to people.  We always go to After Parties. We have thousands of fans that we have become super personal with and we consider them friends more than anything.  We always go out of our way to help our fans with any troubles they have. People can reach out to us at any time for anything and we will be there to help as much as we can.  We have been working so hard for so long that we have no other life than this.  What we do is beautiful and no other bands have the patience to be as personal as we are with our fans.  It is what we pride ourselves on.  We try to give back to our fans with the fest and make something as awesome as can be for all to enjoy.  
Just a little run down of what we do and plan to do.
