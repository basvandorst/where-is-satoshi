While an interesting proof of concept, it is on testnet, and is not a good enough example (yet, it could be with extra work showing it) to show LN is not useless vapourware, won't require 18 months, etc.
It does not credit article authors.  It does not implement an in-built voting and tipping system, where the user is not required to copy and paste stuff into their wallet.  How it does these things are key to showing the usefulness of LN for a yours type implementation.  The yours ui is quite clunky, but it proves it works and could be done a lot better.
For yalls.  Where does closing channels and getting paid come into this?  Can it do inline tipping and voting without acting as a custodial wallet with user's private keys?  This is yet to be seen and implemented for that matter.

You call it bcash because one day it is going to "be cash?"  BCH supporter?
