I'm glad you're doing this, your comments are a great help for improving my site.
Thanks :) If changetip was still a thing, I'd toss a few bits.

Beautiful UI usually refers to whether it follows official iOS or Google Material design standards. In non-mobile applications, I do web design by hobby and have a fairly good grasp at was is considered a good looking UI.
But you're right, that shouldn't affect scoring at all... it doesn't really offer any usability bonus or security difference. I set the scoring to zero.
In the end, I'm just trying to help people find a wallet to use because I've seen countless threads in the past about beginners asking for a recommended wallet.

You're right, 2FA shouldn't affect usability at all. I've tested all wallets and  have given them objective true/false for their features, and the rank is just a combination of the feature scores. Now that I look back, GreenAddress shouldn't have "beautiful UI".
Things are still improving, it's a brand new website.

Perhaps decentralized exchanges could solve this? I've heard of such an exchange called "BitSquare", but have never used it.

Isn't the "fair" price precisely what the market determines? Isn't that a side effect of a market?

Ah, I see. So you suspect that since the hash rate is increasing faster than the market price's moving average, the market price has fallen behind? That's an interesting way to look at it: sort of a predicted bitcoin *potential* price as per the current hash rate.

Please note that you may have difficulty with Amazon purchases! I haven't tried this service (looks really cool) but a possible word of caution:
A card used for an Amazon purchase is charged when the product gets shipped (no sooner) so the card will expire with your funds before any money is sent.

Wouldn't this mean anything on Amazon?
Thinking about Purse.io and buying Amazon gift cards with Gyft.

I suppose, since so many people despise him, that anything he says will seen as truth by his followers, and the exact opposite will be truth by those that don't like him. So if he negatively talks about Bitcoin, his opponents may subconsciously think of Bitcoin positively. (And vice versa)

The dollar value per bitcoin is obviously determined by the price people are willing to pay for one. Supply/demand stuff.
However, the *intrinsic* value of a bitcoin token (not the payment network) is that there is a limited supply, it it easily divisible, it is transportable, and it is not based on an institution. Many of the same properties are what gives gold it's intrinsic value.
Fiat differs from Bitcoin because it lacks the limited supply and is prone to the will of an institution. One intrinsic value of fiat in my opinion is overwhelming amount of adoption.
(All of this is my opinion though. I've seen lots of philosophical debate on what exactly "intrinsic value" even is)

Why would we have to switch to a new cryptocurrency? We could just increase Bitcoin's token divisibility.

Good... I'm sick of misinformation about the Lightning Network. Also cleared some stuff up for me as well.

TLDR: "A tax-free bitcoin economy can't exist because you have to pay taxes."
Not a great article.

But Bitcoin is more fun :/
