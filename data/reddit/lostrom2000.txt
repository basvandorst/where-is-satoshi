This is copied directly from the Dell website under the bitcoin Terms of Service.  Coinbase is their payment processor so you have to deal with them.
If you are using a Coinbase wallet and attempt to initiate a payment of Bitcoins different from the exact cost of the transaction indicated by Coinbase, your transaction will not complete. If you are using a non-Coinbase wallet and attempt to initiate a payment of Bitcoins different from the exact cost (plus miner’s fee) of the transaction indicated by Coinbase, your transaction will not complete but your payment may be processed by the Bitcoin network; in such cases, the full amount of your Bitcoin payment will be refunded by Coinbase as further described below. In the event of any such mispayment, if you intend to complete the original transaction you will be required to re-submit payment for the correct Bitcoin amount. Note that in the interim the Bitcoin exchange rate may have updated to a different rate and the Bitcoin value of your purchase price therefore may have changed.
Refund in the event of mispayment.
For refund of a mispayment in Bitcoin, regardless of whether the transaction was completed via a Coinbase or non-Coinbase wallet, the refund will be in Bitcoin and processed via Coinbase, and you must have, or create, a Coinbase account in order to receive the refund. In the event of a refund, Coinbase will send a refund notification email to the email address you provided to Coinbase at the time of the original Bitcoin transaction. If you do not have a Coinbase account associated with the email address to which the refund email was sent, the refund notification email will explain how to create or access your Coinbase account to claim your refund. If the refund notification email is sent to an email address associated with an existing Coinbase account, the refund will automatically be credited by Coinbase to such account. If you are unable to (1) access the email address associated with your transaction or (2) use the Coinbase service or access a Coinbase account, you will not be able to receive a refund for a mispaid transaction"

We all have to understand that these bankers' understanding of bitcoin are at levels where the average geek bitcoiner was at in 2010 or 2011.  Just trying to wrap their heads around it.  They are probing it and studying it for angles that will benefit them the most, which basically means screwing the majority under the guise of "financial services".  
What they don't understand is, and what will be the most fun to watch when they finally DO understand, is that they have already lost.  There is no way for them to use bitcoin blockchain technology in the way they want, without compromising the decentralized, trustless nature of it.   Ledgers already exist, they're called "databases" and I'm sure Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, et al use them on a daily basis.   That's all blythe masters is talking about: databases and she seems to be exciting herself by associating the word blockchain with it.  Big fuckin deal.   If it's not decentralized and it's not trustless, then it's just a centralized database, nothing to see here.  Sorry for the rant.

Most retailers use a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase. Because of this, the retailer doesn't even see the coin, it goes straight to the processor who then gives the retailer the fiat equivelant. When you buy at Newegg or Overstock, you're actually giving your bitcoin to Coinbase or Bitpay, who I wager are NOT dumping that coin, because they need as much as possible on hand to sell to others. They probably sell enough to keep some baseline ratio for their fiat/btc stores, but it does NOT mean that massive amounts of coin are being dumped because retailers accept bitcoin.
Educate yourself.

I tried CPU mining on my laptop in 2011 (didn't work, too late for CPU by then)
I then lost about 20 BTC playing Satoshi Dice.

I think there is a huge emotional connection to bitcoin, for and against, similar to what is experienced with politics and religion.  If someone strongly identifies with something, whether it's a financial, religious or political concept, they will fight 'to the death' that which competes with the concept they have bonded with.   It's purely emotional.

@_date: 2014-10-04 22:46:12
What you're proposing is just another version of fiat.  Inflation is something that as a society, we've been conditioned to accept as normal, but it is not.  Scarcity combined with utility is what creates value.  Fiat definitely is not scarce and it has utility only because the gov't tells us it does, it's basically just scrip whose "value" is only as good as the gov't that issues it.  
Bitcoin is created outside of any one gov't, has utility and is scarce.   Let's not mess with that formula.

@_date: 2014-04-20 16:50:06
Yes you are right, less money going around means less monetary units to be able to pay the debts racked up in the previous inflationary cycle.  This is what causes the defaults of the industries and banks that rely on credit (debt) to do business.  Debt based finance needs continuously inflating money supply in order to use the newly minted money to pay the older debt that was taken out at less inflated rates.  
There is no coincidence that the only time the researchers found a depression tied with deflation was AFTER 1913, the establishment of the FED, when our WHOLE monetary system began to be linked with debt.

Well put.  That's what has been bugging me about this whole "blockchain good, bitcoin bad" meme that raging right now.  There's no inherent reason for these people to be using a blockchain unless they want trustless transacting, which it appears they don't.   It seems they're latching onto a buzzword for "database", but the way they're trying to implement it, it goes against the whole purpose of a blockchain.   When I put on my tinfoil hat, it almost seems that this meme is being used as a subtle way to undermine bitcoin as a whole.

 It seems you may be thinking that because the price just constantly rises, that bitcoin must be a ponzi.
 From Wikipedia: 
"A Ponzi scheme (also a Ponzi game) is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent."
From the above quote you can pretty much figure out how bitcoin is not a ponzi.
-There is no central operator, where you send your investment
-There is no enticement of high returns from said central operator.
-Investments in ponzi schemes are not tradeable on the open market
-As soon as you acquire your bitcoin and safely secure them in your own wallet (not on an exchange), no one can take them from you .i.e shut down and run with the money.
Buying and selling to "the next fool for a higher value" is called trading, just like in the stock market although there is no guarantee you'll get a higher value.    If there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go up, if there are more sellers than buyers the price will go down.
This does not happen in a ponzi.
Some people may disagree but in my opinion, the main use case of bitcoin is trustless store of value with no counterparty risk of loss.  It's use as a payment system is important, but secondary and will get improved as time goes on.

@_date: 2015-10-19 19:14:47
wow, after looking it up, it seems to have a rather confusing usage, although regarding my usage of it, I will quote a comment from someone on other site about it:
"I have always been mystified at the unqualified "open to discussion or debate" meaning of moot, and consider it to be an error (at least if used within the confines of American English). I've never seen it used that way, without the accompanying notion that though the question itself is unresolved, it is not useful to debate in the current context because of lack of relevance. If someone declared that a point was moot, then followed up with "... so let's debate it right now!", I would either seek help for the individual or avoid further contact."  -- Lucouno
@_date: 2015-10-19 06:30:04
The point is that it will make it a lot easier for current users and believers in bitcoin to use their unit of value in everyday life, which may eventually plant a seed in mainstream society, causing other more casual people to also eventually take part.  This same process also happened with debit and credit cards 50 years ago as people moved from pure cash.   Trying to compare the present use of VISA to bitcoin is comparing apples to oranges, because they are in completely different stages of development.  it's like expecting a toddler (bitcoin)  to walk and talk like an adult (VISA) which has already had its "killer app" moment since the '60s.  Bitcoin still has some growing up to do, but it shouldn't be dismissed because of that.
