This is good! Before the november crash everyone was shouting the price will explode upward. Now I see a lot of post "predicting" the price will go below 3000/2500/1500 USD etc..

[This answer]( on Quora sums up the price effects on BTC by cash settled futures.  
These cash settled futures makes it possible for big money to bet against bitcoin. So when there are more sellers than buyers (and this is the case) in the futures market, the futures price of bitcoin will be suppressed. This makes it attractive to sell physical BTC and buy the suppressed futures and results in a decline in the physical BTC price. I think big money saw an opportunity to (finally) bet against the insane price increase last year, resulting in a decline of the BTC price.   
Also, I think cash settled futures makes it more interesting to manipulate the physical BTC price. If you can manipulate the price, you can open a levered futures position and make a substantial profit.

When you're worried and start to become emotional about your investment, you will end up making poor decisions.   
If you need the money in the future, sell, and find a more stable investment. If you're just greedy: HODL. Most people can't handle this type of market volatility and you probably end up buying at a higher price (at least that has been my experience :))

I don't get it. Why would any rational person/company sell borrowed physical bitcoins and gain absolutely nothing by doing this, because the short position is hedged by futures. This seems to me a lot of hassle for nothing.

Reading this article made me dumber. Thanks

No one knows for sure. I like to believe bitcoin has similar properties as Gold, the ultimate hedge against systemic failure.

3 dashed lines and you call this analysis? just saying..

Seems far-fetched to me. Frac banks have better things to do than allocating resources to breaking bitcoin and not profiting from it.
Remember that you will also need to buy back your borrowed short positions/return the borrowed bitcoins and unwind futures position.. which then, according to the same logic, will result in a opposite move..(?)
