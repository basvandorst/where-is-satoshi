yup - it's not like everyone is simply not going to use a bank and just stick to clients on their devices...
In Australia:
1) We pay for bills via bpay.
2) We get paid (salary) into our bank accounts via bsb &amp; acc numbers.
Basically everyone needs to adopt the blockchain as the "way" to move funds around to replace just those two things. Then there is everything else that runs off "accounts".
Like you said - nothing is going to really change if they adopt the block chain as the "account", still going to run a ledger internally...

heh, no response to my support ticket.
transactions now showing on the blockchain.
basically if you are going to use iGot be prepared to wait...

from passing by some forums, there are a lot of well intentioned people that send people up the garden path or trolls - not really clear which is which though.
a bit like this fella [YouTube: NextGenHacker101 on How to view someones IP address and connection speed!](
so the idea is solid, need a way to filter people I reckon ;)

That is a great ad campaign idea, nice one.
I hate cigs because I am affected even though i am not actively participating in the activity!! Giving people a $ incentive to alter their preferred activities is a win for me then, less opportunities to encounter forced smoking events...

I don't want to pay for groceries with Bitcoin, fuck waiting around for several hours for the store to confirm the purchase. :P
I'd use Dash though and it would need to be instant, preferably connected to a card rather than my phone. Phones suck at anything real-time (they work eventually, however having to unlock, open the app, click something, wait etc is shit)

Anyone got a link to a recent snapshot of the DB? Faster to synch a few days/weeks vs years...

That seems like a bad idea...
I thought Amex was great with chargebacks, so massive risk for a crypto exchange.

Totally. I bought my Note 3 and Nexus 10 from  and I've ordered two Nexus 5's from them. Would not have been able to buy these 4 devices if I didn't mine those coins back in 2011.
If I had the capital I'd setup a specialty store for electronics as well.
