i can vouch for Ledger nano s... but not the x.
the trezor looks ok too, but a larger screen and price. both work well.
i have ledger, my friend trezor.
both easy to use, trezor slightly easier for noobs.

no fees, just transfer my bank money onto card. no charge to hold or spend.
as the first replying member said, rebates in crypto, and spotify netflix airport lounges.. with the next level card (indigo is on order).
this ruby only gets me 2% rebate and spotify only. but no fees is what i like. i plan to earn crypto while i spend fiat

oh.. i cant see a scam aspect, i have been looking into this one for months... im super sceptic about everything too-good-to-be-true ( this is my first crypto card).
i can spend my crypto, but i choose to hodl for now and earn extra crypto in the form of mco rebates.
Australia isnt fully crypto friendly yet, so this is how we stay within the law and grow crytpo awareness... til things change on the ground. when it does, i will be ready.
"no idea what this is good for...  the card is pretty much a scam"  sorry, but thats brackets with no info in between. i am open to facts and information- feel free to share if you have any

@_date: 2019-11-19 14:16:55
sure no probs. crypto_com has a reddit page
its an app on apple android. wallet and visa (debit) card functions are all in one. im in Australia but usa and asia pacific works too. euro very soon i think.
install  crypto dot com  and register as a genuine user (its a legit service, they require email &amp; id to conform to local laws).
if you use the bonus code ' tuhd5hkjrk ' , they release 50 dollars worth of crypto when you reserve a card (like mine). the cards give you crypto rebates when you spend fiat.. mine has free spotify and 2% rebate. im gonna upgrade, to get free netflix and 3% rebate.
thats how i did it. i also store my btc and eth in there for passive staking. the card arrived yesterday and is metal. you can reserve any card, Blue is free, Ruby needs 50mco in the wallet,  you get your card but the mco has to be staked for a free metal card. 
 
i also used the gift card function (got a demo video on my yutube).  theres a lot of functions in the app like credit, interest and exchange. i havent used the investment function at all.
sorry if its too long. i only listed the functions i have tried. i am hodling the free coins and spending my cash thru the card. 
i hope this helps
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:33:31
if you still have 1.009 and .001 btc in two addresses, and they are your own... everything is fine.
if you bought 1btc in a lump sum, it has to be broken up before sending the smaller amount (you dont need to do it, it all behind the scenes).

they probably wont even send out your Nano.. because your funds will be stuck in a third party payment agency.
they will ask you to email them or use a fake online payment form. there is no hack for Ledger Nano, just a usb with Ledger printed on it if youre lucky.
just because its a google ad doesnt mean its a real shop. check back in a couple days, the ad will be taken down
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:02:18
yep. it has a wallet app where i store most of my liquid cryptos. it takes 20 seconds to convert most coins to btc instantly at market price (no additional fees). 
im keeping btc in the 'Earn' section to earn some interest (they loan out these coins during the lockup period at a slightly higher margin).
im not hiding any of these 'assets' from my local government. I will need to keep upto date with my tax obligations as requested by Australian Tax Office. i feel safe from that aspect.
i havent listened to the Onecoin podcast yet.. but will pay more attention now that things are getting serious (my btc is now tangible). i used to be a sceptic, now in a hodler
@_date: 2019-11-16 17:54:31
no chance of finding any Bitcoins with that hardware.
google 'gpu mining rig' and you will see the minimum required to join a mining pool.. no hope if youre standalone.
your pc will only be good for desktop staking altcoins only. in any case, you wont cover your power bills
@_date: 2019-11-16 08:14:26
you can ban it, but cant kill it. you can see my point though right?..
an untaxed asset or currency can easily be outlawed if it falls outside the rules that govern fiat. there is no legislation or ground work to defend the legitimacy of btc in most countries.
Australia is using Anti Money Laundering to squeeze everybody now. trying to make it illegal to spend more than 10k$ in cash. thats only about 1btc...
they can move the goalposts just outside our reach at anytime. just classify btc as a scam and its game over
[edit] if youre going to the trouble of downvoting, share your opinion and make it a fair discussion. as a hodler, im dissapointed.

your second paragraph is a bit confusing.

@_date: 2019-10-05 12:57:42
surely over 10M$. its supply/demand * inflation.
if people are willing to pay 1M for a btc, these same people will be able to pay 10M for a house. i think the price will represent perceived value and has no logical correlation to past  prices.
i would pay 10btc for a house... but would i pay $10M in usd ??
mind you, a loaf of bread might cost $50 due to artificial inflation (real estate and fuel costs will drive everything upwards faster).
i btc hits $1M, i foresee chaos.

@_date: 2019-12-26 03:40:04
i think the problem was; i was pointing to the links i used for qt wallets and syncronising them, and also refering to altcoins that use identical desktop wallet clones wasnt a good idea.
the vids about bitcoin faucets was a grey area too. but i only reviewed and used 'trustworthy' sites in the vids.
my vids were a journal of my journey and experiences with all forms of crypto, i just showed the technical side and let people Do Their Own Research. 
i never advised or promoted trading. it was like a Vlog with btc/alt facts.
@_date: 2019-12-28 11:57:55

some back story please
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:31:52
i dont think cz was refering to the anonymity factor at all.. but rather the physical convenience and purchase limits only (when it eventually becomes impossible to make anon gold purchases, they will convert to cryptos as it will be more convenient despite kyc).
i think gold holders are easier to entice as they have the same outlook and attitude as bitcoin hodlers. thats my view.
 i have both. but gold is infinitely harder to transact with my peers.
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:13:35

am i over-reacting? this week i removed almost a dozen vids (btc and alts) fearing that i would get another strike violation if i didnt.
i love bitcoin and used to love youtube. is this the end for btc/yt channels? is there anyone in the btc community that has some weight on the platform and can get a clear and precise outline for me/us?
i didnt realise how unnerving this was until i added up my views and likes.. a lot of people have watched and benefited (and perhaps been introduced to btc for the first time). i got more views on crypto vids than the other vids. most were non-monetised.
thanks for putting up with me.
