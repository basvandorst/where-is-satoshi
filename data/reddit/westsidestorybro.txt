It is not bad. It is just math. It is required to do things like online banking or purchasing from websites like amazon. Also can be used to protect your data on your phone or personal computer. Thinking that we can circumvent encryption by providing a key that only law enforcement can use shows a gross misunderstanding of the math behind encryption. You cannot create a key that others beside law enforcement, will not find and then use it for their own, possible malicious purposes. Here watch this [video](

Now you are just being rude. Once you start dishing the insults you have already lost the argument. It really wouldn't have been hard to post something like a link to an existing explanation instead you choose to demean and insult.  Not to mention your predictions are likely false.

Simply put, he is using the previous run up to show a pattern that could indicate another run up but that is debatable. Read though the other posts here and do some of your own research before committing to anything.

That is a emotional reaction. We choose to take  the risk, it is easier to deal with when you can accept it as a total loss before you buy in, thereby dismissing the emotional attachment. The investment has a purpose and a risk and only one can win.

Not going to let you move the goalposts. 
Your claim has been refuted. Recant or fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:41
When you commit to an investment that involves risk you are basically forfeiting that money to begin with. The hope is that it pays off and we do our best to mitigate risk but you cannot approach it emotionally. It will drive you crazy.

My approach to investments is recognizing the money I invested has a purpose and I accepted  a certain amount of risk while trying to accomplish my primary goal, growing my capital. I only ever invest what I can afford to lose but continually invest(not only in crypto). Once I commit the money to an investment to me it is gone until I decide to reclaim it. With this mind set I have found I am less vulnerable to knee jerk reactions and price fluctuation anxiety.

[On August 21, 2014, Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics.\[31\] None of the procuring murder allegations were part of Ulbricht's indictment in New York,\[32\] although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's sentence.\[33\]
On February 4, 2015, Ulbricht was convicted on all non-violent counts after a jury trial that took place in January 2015.\[34\] On May 29, 2015, he was sentenced to double life imprisonment plus forty years, without the possibility of parole.\[35\]\[36\]\[37\]
On the last day of trial, Serrin Turner, the NY lead prosecutor, addressed the jury and stated that none of the six contracted murders-for-hire allegations occurred.\[28\] One charge of procuring murder was originally filed in October 2013 in a separate pending indictment in Maryland \(which was later dismissed in its entirety in July 2018\);\[8\] the other five allegations were never filed.\[38](

I was just pointing out the weakness of the argument as it can be broadly applied to almost anything. This is the problem with applying broad concepts to something that was meant to be a joke; they fall flat for those who are not offended by it.
