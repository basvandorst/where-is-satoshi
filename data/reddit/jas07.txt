Those people are wrong all the time though.  For instance they both predicted that we would see hyperinflation instead we saw very little inflation over the last few years.  They are just making educated guesses on the economy and listening to them has been wrong as often as right.

Gold would have returned less than a 4 percent ROI even if we use your wait till it falls to 900 number.  That's opposed to an annualized return of 15.45% for the S and P 500 in that time.  That's not a good investment.


your own article states they are thinking 2.8% this year.  That is considered a healthy inflation number as it spurs investment and is a long way from his hyper inflation numbers.  Even if it slightly ticks up there is almost no way that we will see hyperinflation by your 2017 number.  But as it sounds like you won't accept that he could be wrong we will have to wait until your 2017 day and watch how wrong he was.  Everyone makes bad predictions this is just one of his.

Let me understand your argument.  If hyperinflation happens eventually then he was right?  So if it is in 20 years he was right? how about 50? how about 100 was he still right? I could say the stock market will collapse, and if it happens ten years from now I wouldn't consider myself to be this amazing person that predicted it.
Its now 6 years from this segment and its pretty obvious he was wrong.  He is stating that QE would lead in increased inflation if left untouched.  Well we left it untouched and it actually lasted longer than planned when this segment aired.  We have seen no signs of inflation or the stagflation that he mentions.  If we had seen some sign of inflation during that time and not the near record lows I might agree and think his argument had merit.  We also saw the countries (Euro block) that followed his advice (no QE, increase rates) have higher inflation and have now reversed course and decided that QE is good for them too.
He also makes a call to buy gold.  That would have been a pretty bad investment in 2009, but if you want to listen to people like that go ahead and buy gold.

This makes no sense.  There is always compound interest in investments it is how rate of return is calculated.  Also I didn't say that it was a money loss.  More of an opportunity loss in that if you listened to Peter you would have missed out on the huge stock market gains of that time.


Yes your own chart shows that gold barely moved or even lost value for about 25 years.  I would call that a poor investment.  I also like how the chart conveniently leaves out the past five years


It is now 2015 video is more than 2 years old.  Also are you really going to argue about time frames again.  


I just showed that he has made several other calls because they make calls all the time.  Just like most people some are right and some are wrong.  You were claiming that they didn't make calls all the time while leaving other calls unfilled/wrong.  But you can go ahead and listen to him all you want.  I just posted two examples of him being wrong about different indications.  I just don't like it when people like these make bold claims are wrong and people lose lots of money, such as what would have happened if people listened to them and bought gold in 2012

You didn't watch the video did you?  


He mentions a specific time table of by 2014 in it.

900*1.045^5.5 = 1146.  Your math is wrong as you did not include compound interest (very important when calculating rate of return)  Also December 2009 until now is 5.5 years not 4.5.
Your statement that gold is risk free is just ridiculous.  Gold goes up and down in price all the time.  That is the definition of investment risk.  In fact there has been analysis done that shows gold is actually a riskier investment than stocks.  [This analysis]( on the price of gold vs the S and P 500 over the last 90 years shows that the standard deviation on the price of gold is actually higher than that of the S and P 500.  That is with the small returns
Also just because you asked here is another video of Peter [being wrong](  The video is from 2012 and in it he says that gold will go to $5000 an ounce in the next few years.  What we actually ended up seeing is gold collapsing and the dollar surging in the few years after he made that statement

your right but they wouldn't produce them for long

basic supply and demand people will pay where the supply and demand curves intersect.  Cost to make goods directly affects the supply curve

Wrong PE ratio is calculated by market value per share/ earnings per share.  It is a measure of income not profit so dividends and capital investment will have no bearing on the PE ratio.  Companies can have the same PE ratio with vastly different amounts of capital required.

I really have enjoyed it.  It was a good case study in economics with all the people explaining that it wasn't a bubble, and that bitcoin was different than all the other bubbles.  It was like watching the psychology and greed of a bubble in real time.

Amazon is even worse at a PE ratio of 3000

But that three years of labor does affect price, because that affects supply.  There is a direct correlation between amount of energy put in and supply.  No one would produce the item if there wasn't any profit in it.

real question here.  Do you all think the recent rise in prices is a bubble?  I am really fearing there will be a big crash soon.
