I think there are several blockchain projects created by anonymous developers. I know at least "aeon" (a cryptonote light monero variant) and "Ellaism" (a variant of ethereum without premine). 
Admittedly, nobody has really tried to find who they are though.

If there is a crisis, people will secure their assets. 
Bitcoin is not yet the more secure asset, so they will reduce their position. The question is: will they reduce it less than other assets (like the current country fiat) because they believe in it more or not?

Maybe this will encourage Signal to integrate Bitcoin (and eventually Monero).
