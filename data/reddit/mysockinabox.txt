I've hurd about this before.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:11:03
I don't know any examples that support your last statement, but I believe that they exist. Nevertheless, I agree that a single entity is the problem. However, it is lack of reasonable regulation that allows our central bank/fed/GS sham to continue. I think that should be regulated against and broken up.
It isn't regulation that is bad, it is bad regulation that causes trouble. But anarchy is not the solution either.
The "NPR type" description just seems unnecessary.
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:14:38
What is the NPR type, and are you suggesting that all regulation of the financial system bad?
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:17:00
You and I both know what I meant connotatively, at least. And more importantly, even by definition it is the absence of rule or law. So if you have something valuable to say do so, but that was not it.

@_date: 2016-05-28 04:12:27
Thank you. I didn't know about that. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:40:12
Look, as I stated elsewhere, I do know what two factor authentication is. I use it for my Gmail account and a few others. However, I was not familiar with the abbreviation. As a result, I though he might be referencing the first 3 of the transaction hash, which would have indicated this was not an isolated incident. I feel silly now, but that is the case.
Also, I did not know that Mt. Gox supported this. In reality, I should have just moved it to my secure wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:54:38
No, but I would blame the thief. If Ford made a car with locks that seemed to work but didn't I would blame them. If Ford gave a key to a thief so they could steal it, I would blame Ford. If Ford itself stole my car using a master key, I would blame Ford.
I am not blaming Mt. Gox. I don't know exactly what happened. I blame the thief, and accept responsibility for my foolishness that allowed this to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:32:21
Yeah, I hate to be the example, but somebody needs to be. I should have tranfered it to my wallet instead of whatching that Louis C.K. video and falling asleep. Trader beware.
Some extra information. I do not believe my computer was hacked because the transaction came from another IP. I don't believe I have any malware, but you never know. I run Mint 15, so it seems unlikely.
I did however have my password in Lastpass. I'm changing all of those passwords now.
Also, I have only logged into Mt. Gox from my home computer, ever.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:51:56
That Change article helps alot. However, why are there 4 source wallets rather than one as in the example on that wiki? Thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:42:09
I wouldn't recommend taking advice from the guy that just lost $12 000 USD, but that's your call. Move it to a secure wallet, on your own machine, in a backed up Truecrypt volume... right now. Leave some in Coinbase, if you intend to transact.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:20:56
Well we don't want that. The story needs to be told. I have removed the donation link. I have removed the link.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:45:58
While I don't think of myself as a fool often, I certainly was in this case. I don't want pity cash. I really don't know the best way to offer proof, but I would be happy to do so. I have all of the transaction information, but probably couldn't prove that it didn't come to me. However, it would seem an odd ruse.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:33:54
What I find interesting is that the email about the withdraw told me to contact them immediately if I did not initiate the transfer. Why? If they are going to do nothing about it, not even reply, why even send the email notification.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:00:04
Thank you. Actually, I do know about 2FA, I just didn't know the abbreviation. I use it for a few other accounts, but not this one (the most important one). Thanks for the tip on the PPA for Firefox.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:58:32
Yeah, I now have a 2FA Coinbase account, too. Now I just have to find a time machine.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:07:52
Right on. You are correct in every way. It could have happened to anyone at anytime, as long as we don't know what happened.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:32:35
I have to research what you have done here, because I am not familiar with u/bitcointip. I think you have tipped me. Thank you sincerely. Have a wonderful weekend.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:51:42
Well I'm not. At least, not until I have a clear picture of what happened. That said, my lack of security is a huge mistake, and I take responsibility for that. However, if I leave my car unlocked, I still blame the thief for taking it. If Mt. Gox stole it or facilitated the theft with bad software, they share the responsibility. If not, it clearly is not their fault.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:08:05
Yeah, I can't even stress the disappointment. Wife and I about to buy a house.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:25:58
I did not. I was foolish and for that I have paid dearly.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:47:20
That is pretty awesome. I have read the documentation now. Again, thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:23:04
Yeah, my wife and I are completely fucked up right now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:43:18
I agree. I have used this password before, but never with this username to my knowledge. I believe Mt. Gox could do a better job.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:18:14
I do not know what diagnostic to perform. I do not see a way that I can ever come to know exactly what happened to me this morning.
There were clearly proactive steps necessary that I failed to take. That is the most important lesson in this. Don't leave your money in somebody else's hands, enable 2FA, and be cautious.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:06:51
What is 2FA?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:35:56
Well, I'm a bit biased right now, but it sounds like a fantastic idea.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:11:16
Sure thing. It has been updated.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:14:36
It is so tough to keep that perpective after such a loss, but you are correct. Time marches on, and the future cannot be told. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:42:17
I don't know. Actually, I don't think they got my password from there. They may have, but I don't know where the password theft took place, so I am not blaming Lastpass. Really, I am blaming myself. All of my important documents and family picture, etc are stored in backed up encrypted volumes. I just hadn't moved my bitcoin there yet.
I knew better than to leave the money there last night. Ugh.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:46:22
It is intriguing to say the least. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:23:10
Sent the following to back to Mt. Gox
Dear Mt.Gox Team,
I know enough to know that I am pretty screwed. My real question is whether you are going to do any mitigation. The more research I have done, the more I see the following:
+ Nearly all Bitcoin thefts I find happen to Mt.Gox users
+ There is no way to ensure that Mt.Gox is not the culprit
+ Mt.Gox has done little to improve security
You should consider:
+ Forcing two-factor authentication before any transfers
+ Require email verification for all transfers over x BTC
+ Don't send an email asking us to reply as though you can do something about it. Be honest from the get go.
+ DO NOT AUTHORIZE transactions from accounts that have previously only connected from one country ever that log from another country... EVER. It is obvious fraud, and you do nothing about it. You could at least hold all transfers initiated from foreign countries and computers for 24 hours.
+ Beef up your support mechanism. A 9 hour response time doesn't cut it.
I do accept some responsibility. I should have been less lax, and I should have never trusted Mt. Gox given all of the thefts reported.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:22:32
I have no idea. Which is why I feel the exchange is responsible.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:55:21
I'm sorry. I didn't know how they did this internally. It is clearer now. This is exactly why I am asking. I have provided no literature to others, and I wouldn't unless it was well researched.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:21:30
You are right to some extent. I think it is overkill to say get out of the "bitcoin nonsense". There are some problems, and the exchanges could be the primary thiefs, but as long as you store the money privately, you should be fine. The design of the currency is great. The exchanges are the problem.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:58:04


So that others don't make the same foolish mistakes. People should care, so that they don't end up hurt. As said over and over again in the thread, I did not have 2FA; this is a foolish mistake. I did not use this user/pass in other places.
What do you mean I lack security? I keep my OS up to date, I have an encrypted file system, and keep all of my important documents in Truecrypt volumes. I just didn't have my BTC there, and that was a major screw up.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:01:13
Haha. Thanks for the smile on a shitty day. You have any interest in Kansas City?
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:26:22
I couldn't have purchased a house for that amount. However, that amount does make a hefty portion of the downpayment.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:46:52
You are correct. I must have commented while on the same page and failed to click both save buttons. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:51:09
I did. I'm not an expert, but I did make an effort. Very insightful.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:32:19
Yes, and it does. I see the transaction now on Blockchain, but I don't honestly know what I can do with that.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:38:28
That sounds like a pretty good idea. I wish there was a least something that could be done. I would like to be able to monitor this wallet address and IP for future transactions, but even if I did see they purchased from another service with the same account which would be foolish, I would probably not be able to get a court order to find out the user of that account.
As it stands, there are many smart things you can do proactively, but apparently not a damn thing that can be done reactively.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:23:28
It is a fresh installation; less that a month old. Very little software. I don't see anything in `ps -A` that looks suspicious. You may be right, but that seems like a really big hammer to swing right now. Also, there is very little motivation to steal any of the rest of my worthless, uninsteresting, personal information (at least it feels that way). I have gone through Lastpass and changed all of my important passwords. I may do a fresh installation, but what a pain.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:11:18
There are several different wallets you can use. I do not have any recommendations. Transferring is easy. You wallet will have an address. You just go to Coinbase and transfer to that address.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:50:18


Another user posted an idea of developing a service that tracks and helps recuperate stolen funds. I don't know exactly how it would work, but I have some ideas. As with any new technology, there will be lessons learned and improvements made. Even just average user knowledge, like yours and mine, improving helps the system.
I am sorry you had to go through that.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:02:41
Okay, with the information here I was able to figure out what to search for.
According to this [Wikipedia entry on Bitcoin Protocol](


That explains the multiple sources in the transaction. I've got it now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:33:24
The answer is simple. I bought them there. I have never made a single transaction outside of the purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:37:21
Not so. Lastpass has a hashed version of my passwords. That means that without my master password which I change very often and do not store, nobody can get those passwords. Like Mega.co.nz, if you lose your password, you are screwed. The service cannot access your data.
As an aside, I admit this isn't the most secure way to keep passwords. For that reason, I do not keep most of my sensitive passwords there. *...most*
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:18:25
Actually, I got an offer and didn't accept, and 10 BTC is there merely to represent what was lost. Obviously nobody would donate that. I should have used 2FA, but I did not. That doesn't mean my short skirt got me raped. Thank you for your input.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:57:32
It was "Oh My God." I would feel so much better if the money had gone to Louis.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:48:17
I'm not sure I realized a gain, since it never was taken out, but I don't know much about this situation.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:12:23
Really? That sucks. I just lost five figures. That was the most money I've ever had, and the light at the end of a long and shitty tunnel.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:19:10
Maybe they're right. "Where is the [continuum transunctioner]( Its mystery is only exceeded by its power."
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:16:17
Then may we lock arms and cry together. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:45:28
I don't follow. It would definitely have been worth any investment in security. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:04:07
Well, I don't deny what you are saying about the odds, but as I describe elsewhere in this thread, I actually do know how to handle data well. I just didn't. I screwed up; I was lazy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:28:12
Well, I think I do know pretty well. I was foolish and lazy. I wasn't invested 10k initially. I invested $200 USD, and let it sit. I pondered moving the money last night to a secure wallet, but watched Louis C.K. instead and decided I would do that today. There are few, if any, decisions that I regret more.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:44:53
Absolutely, sometimes an example must be set. I hate to be the example, but for the love of money, secure your monies.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:06:42
Both the IP and the transaction hash say, "Unrecognized search pattern"
I would love to find out it hasn't gone through, but Mt. Gox won't reply to my support ticket.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:53:01
Yes, that is what I thought. This is getting clearer.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:10:50
Do they hold up transactions for security? If I saw a transfer of this amount of money I would probably want to verify it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:48:29
There would be no clear path to grow toward maturity, if we didn't have to learn these lessons the hard way. I sure would like to help make it better.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:09:08
Oh right. No I did not have that enabled. I am embarrassed for my stupidity. I should have just moved them off of the exchange, instead of going to sleep.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:56:18
None. I wish I did. I would like to avoid this in the future. Not that I foresee ever standing to lose this much again. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:02:06
$200 USD if my math is correct. Yes, your point is the same thing my wife and I keep repeating to each other. It doesn't feel that way though. That is exactly what happened with the authentication; just laziness.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:56:18
Absolutely. It seems like such a simple and elegant solution.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:15:16
Thank you stranger. While that would be very nice of you, I must be honest. My daughter, wife, and I will still have food on the table tonight, and I have a decent job. I'm sick of living in a apartment, was about to buy a house, and had a pretty good Christmas planned, but there are surely more relevant charities for you good spirit.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:16:45
Whew, dogded a bullet there. ^*...Lucky*
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:15:18
10 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:22:03
I'm really sorry. It was a kneejerk reaction to a bucket of emotions.
