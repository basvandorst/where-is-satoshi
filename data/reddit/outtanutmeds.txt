I think we got a couple of millioniare's out there who are having kicks pumping this up, and then dumping it. I mean, what else do you do with your time (other than cause mass hysteria) when you are filthy rich?

He must have bought his bitcoin when it approached $20,000.

Do you only want to buy bitcoin, or, are you also interested in alt currencies?

If bitcoin ends up going sideways...be patient.

If you buy a bitcoin, while it is going up, buy on the futures market a "put" option that is soon to expire to hedge your bet. That way, if bitcoin were to crash, your put option will cover most of your loses.

Germany, from 1934 till 1945. At the end of WW2, the Reichsmark was stronger than gold.

Why? The source you sited refers to the hyper-inflation of 1923; not the collapse of the Reichsmark in 1945.
You need to read good sources instead of The Zionist Monthly. If want to see the brilliance of how the Nazis set up their economy, read this book. The author was the last American journalist in Germany prior to the beginning of WW2.

He wouldn't cover all of his loses with a put option, just some of them. Buying a put option does take away some of potential profit, but with this kind of volatility, he needs some kind of hedge. Wouldn't you agree?

You sited Ludwig Von Mises? You must have read Ron Paul's "End The Fed". Do you have a copy? Turn to page 26. Do you see the graph titled "Purchasing Power in the United States of Gold and Selected Currencies". Do you see the Reichsmark? Do you see that it was stronger than gold, the Swiss Franc and the Dollar right up to the end of WW2? Do you see that? Do you know why? I bet you don't. I bet you haven't got a clue, because they don't teach you the truth at gold bug academy. Anyways, you've just been owned by your God, Ron Paul. How does it feel?
