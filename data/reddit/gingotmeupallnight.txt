I do get the point, but this is also NYC. From a small country town like myself I don't know of any store that would turn down gold besides a large chain like Kroger/McDonald's.... The only two large chains in my town lol

I have some serious questions about bitcoin. 
1) I understand people dont like the distribution of wealth in the world, and I understand that there is a certain number of bitcoin. If the world was to switch to crypto over the separation of wealth would look a lot like it does now, would it not?
2) Are there eventually going to be places that will give loans out in bitcoin? And is that then not turning them into a type of financing firm or bank?
3) and can someone just ELI5 what I'm even doing when it comes to bitcoin

I get that everyone will be able to have some. But if from what I've read there is only 3.3 million left and only 1% of the population have some. I feel like it will be mined out before its adopted as a world currency. And if that happens the bottoms going to fall out

I get that. But eventually on a long enough time scale where if the world adopts crypto your going to have to have financial agencies among other things that will eventually put crypto back into the memes that they say about current financial agencies

I appreciate the wonderful answers. I have some follow ups I'd like to ask. 
When you tell someone there is only so many bitcoin and that so much of it has already been mined what would make them want in on it? Like why would I want to get into bitcoin with 0 when a handful have a bunch, a lot have some, and most of the world doesn't have any?
And isnt relying on a digital currency a little risky. Theres a very large portion of the world where internet access is a luxury not a necessary like it is in the western world?

Like because the usd used to be a gold standard until mining slowed way down and switched to an oil standard. Oil slows way down and it will switch to something else. But my point is is that it always has something behind it that gives it some sort of marketability. What's behind bitcoin thats going to give it value? Why would, for all intents and purposes, a completely made up digital thing replace something tangable?

Well thats what I was pointing to earlier. There's no way you're going to convince people to change over when they already have this. Or when you tell them that there isnt enough.
