And show me the evidence that that automatically means they are more secure?  Neiman-Marcus was founded in 1907.  The first Target opened in 1962.  Sony Computer Entertainment has been around since 1992.  Those are just the three I remember off the top of my head.
Established companies have security breaches all the time.  You just can't make a blanket statement like that.  How long a company has been around has zero to do with how secure or trustworthy they are.

The point is that security breaches happen to companies both new and old.  How long a company has been around is a pretty poor metric of how well established or secure they are.
Also, as for it being anecdotal, I did say those are just the three off the top of my head.  Last year also saw security breaches at Facebook, Zendesk, LivingSocial, The New York Times, Twitter, Evernote, the Department of Homeland Security, the Washington State courts, Adobe, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Advocate Medical Group, and god only knows how many others that would take me more than ~2 seconds on Google to find.  Its not like its exactly rare for things to happen to major well established corporations and organizations.

So you never use any service that's less than two years old?  Ok, power to you.  Doesn't mean anything to anyone else though.  Lots of new companies can be secure.
Also, exactly how does a new company "prove itself" if people won't use their service?

People already do this through Gyft and the like anyway though.  Its how I bought Titanfall last week.

I don't have PayPal or a credit card.  Know what I do have?  BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:22:38
That is a fair point.  On the other hand I think there is probably a large overlap between the crowd of people who take advantage of these sorts of workarounds and the crowd who would e-mail and petition Amazon to accept bitcoin.

Meaning what exactly?
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:40:41
Not all of them.  Note he specifically mentioned coinbase.
EDIT:fixed a typo

I can't open a bitcoin line of credit though

Well I'll be damned

Is this accurate?  All the articles I've seen have indicated Turing has the exclusive rights to the drug.

Do you do anything to change the laws in your locale to make them more bike friendly?  Or donate to groups that do?  Or at least advocate to your friends and family the benefits society could have from more bicyclists or bicycle friendly laws?
Its one thing to say you support something, but *actually* **can't** do anything about it.  But you can't just say you support something and then only respond with apathy in your daily life.  Rather, you can, you'd just be wrong.

That's not the same at all.  And people who brand themselves as supporting gay rights usually do have some sort of action to back it up with.

Thanks!  I feel like now I broke a barrier and am ready to spend.  There is a restaurant about 45 minutes from me that takes BTC so I think I'm going to make a trip there soon.

Ditto here man.  Live in Morris County.  Will come check you out in the next few weeks!
