Bitcoins has value just like money has value. I can buy things with bitcoins, it has value.

Your a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:40:39
not the slightest idea.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:46:12
It seems like everyone I had told about bitcoin in the last few years has finally decided im a fucking psycho.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:21:27
Yeah, everyones better than everyone else.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:23:38
....9/11 was a conspiracy too, right?
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:27:49

@_date: 2013-03-30 15:57:23

Yeah, that interview was short. Not sure how shitty it was cause I saw the tail end of it, but it didnt look so good.......
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:04:34
Thanks for you feedback good sir! IM STILL SUPER SCURRED. IDK WHAT TO DO.
Either way I still won. I've cashed out with 230ish, vs the 130ish i started with..... Also, its fun. :) NEED MOAR
Wait for the 10 to cross back over the 21? ;-)

General etiquette to act like a robot and not have some fun? Dont care, will do whatever whenever.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:24:40
O really???
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:53:42
Not sure I understand. The way hes talking, MINIMIZES loses.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:21:42
I understand ur anger... as bitcoin is simply foreign to everybody at the beginning. I use coinbase for my BTC (when im not in a rush), it requires ID and stuff. But you can also use "blueskytraders" basicly you go to a local bank of america and fill an out of state deposit slip. No id, no questions. Bitcoins in ur wallet before you get home(possibly even before u leave the bank!)

I thought its value was based on USD. If I can buy stuff with it, it has value. At the moment, I can buy 95 dollars with each with it.

He means drugs.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:31:04
Dont do it. Dont sell.... But seriously, its going to jump back up anytime now....... IM JUST SO SURE.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:36:00
Wait so.... Hypothetical?
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:32:29
Turn them frowns upside down, its up... or atleast i connected, once. :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:01:55
What fun might you be referring too? Generally curious what you mean.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:35:53
It has value cause I can buy stuff with it.
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:58:53
Whats going on with that bear trap!? ~64 dollars, a BTC currently!
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:13:45
Yes! A month or 3 ago I was wishing I could buy a few bank tabs with a small amount of bitcoin I mined in 4-7 days. If I wasnt so lazy I could verify my mtgox account and pay with CC/USD... but no thanks. Too bad GGG missed out on an easy sell :P
Great to see this in /bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:17:28
Keep guessing, or its gone! :(
