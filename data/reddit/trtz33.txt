Those old rich white men in China and Japan disgust me.

The streets of Venezuela are littered with faces.  He should trust those even more since there are so many.

Why is no one taking this seriously?  This is very disturbing.

You probably could assume only 15,000,000 bitcoins exist (making the calculation exact) since so many have been lost but nevertheless you can see that if you divide the total value of all gold by the total amount of all bitcoin, it will give you roughly 500,000 meaning 1 million per bitcoin would make all bitcoin about twice the value of all gold.

1 million would only make it about twice the value of gold.  Wouldn't have much affect on the dollar.

Damn I miss my girlfriend.  I remember how beautiful she was when I first met her.  She was a worthless bitch when we went out but damn I miss her now.

Good looking, young, healthy man like this doesn't know he has the whole world in front of him regardless of some silly money--that's a damn shame.  With my poor health, I'd trade spots with him in a heart beat.  Of course he's just a drawing and that's probably why.  Now that I look at him closer, his eyes are awful dark.  Hell, he's probably sicker than me.  I take it back.  He's screwed.
