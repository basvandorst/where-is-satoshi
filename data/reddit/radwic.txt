wow, TIL
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:35:27
I’m thankful for my situation because the only people in my office that know I have bitcoin are also enthusiasts and understand it as much as I do

Warehouse job struggle, hardest (labour) job I've ever had. Curious, what's your position? I was a case picker, so I drove [this thing]( around and neatly stacked a few hundred boxes of grocery items on top while timed... best of luck to you man. I hear where you're coming from! May you HODL forever (or until you can cash out and become a millionaire).

why tf didn't he post one[?](
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:55:46
Sounds good man, best of luck to you and your family. Congratulations on your bitcoin milestone!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:07:18
No yeah it makes perfect sense, just never thought that it was that literal!
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:10:23
step 1: this is not twitter  
step 2: stop using hashtags on reddit

Ya, I started making small buys here and there with a wallet on iPhone just to explore and be part of the fun, but I think I'm ready to move to a hardware wallet. I'm leaning toward the Trezor, but I've seen a shit ton of positive feedback regarding both and KeepKey.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:55:42
Thank you, I ordered a Trezor
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:24:48
Then you buy more!

Someone in the original thread said that “bitcoin isn’t a usable currency because Steam stopped accepting it,” I interjected and got downvoted to shit. Hope everyone over there actually fucking knew anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:57
Either that or something a lot of very lucky people experienced - just forgetting they ever bought it long ago. Then of course there's the risk of forgetting passwords/keys/phrases etc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:46:38
Yeah man, I’m excited to see how it does

Question - whys everyone ditching coinbase (I’m out of the loop, not being snarky)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:45
If that ever happens I'm buying 10
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:08:46
good, let people panic so i can buy more
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:59
Fuckin' idiots selling, gives me a better reason to 
 BUY BUY

Just after I spent 89 euros plus 25 euros for shipping and 35 usd import charges
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:47:01
That’s it I’m cashing out I reached my moon I can buy a box of granola bars
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:27:35
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:29:32
Yup, don't worry about cashing out yet, transfer it to an offline wallet as  priority
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:22:48
yes but is it comparing to the same scale? $100 bills have been around for much longer and are far more common/easy to use/widely accepted than bitcoin. go online and 90% malicious of payments are transacted via btc.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:53:54
I want 25 bitcoins :( if I slice my arm off would it be considered a donation
