Nah that's not how I like to do it. Spend round numbers like 100 dollars at 400 and have a set sell line, for example 50% increase. I've made 10 times what I started with so far, although with this method you're not going to get rag to riches quickly.

But then of course - your GPU has a lifespan which you have to factor it...

i bought at 10 sold at 100, convinced it was a great decision.
I had $7500, i could have bought bitcoins, but i chose to pay off some student debt. It was the right decision, but i'm still kicking myself

im sorry, but shouldn't that make them worse investments, if the country is introducing quantitative easing

if it hits 300 ill buy 2 maybe and just try to forget about them. I'm really starting to see why trading drives people nuts. if i had been perfect in my foresight 2 years back I could have bought a flat. instead i justified selling them at 'only' 10x what i paid for them

My dad did one of the very first true computer related degrees when he was young - he's got some great things in his attic - a VGA digital camera the size of a small house brick that cost £2000 for one. I think I may have one of the first few hundred/thousand kids to have digital photographs taken of them growing up. thats speculation though
