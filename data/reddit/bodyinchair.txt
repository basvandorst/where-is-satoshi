US investigation of manipulation is awesome news. I hope they weed out the bad apples and on we go from there

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency could create a decentralized payment method where people own the wealth, not government and elites. Regulations however are absolutely a must for the success of crypto. There's just way too many scams and too many scums in crypto.

It's really annoying how many posts are shilling this project with delusions. I've seen "why bch will save all of crypto" and "bch is the real bitcoin"...most recently the fucktards of bch are talking about the flip where bch dominates everything.

those bears are ruthless (back to sept prices) and obviously financially suicidal. Most are selling at a loss 
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:25:59
they have about 800million worth. If they would sell it they'd have to spread it across multiple exchanges. The 24hr volume of BTC is about 10bil in a regular market. The 800million would disappear in minutes. Also they could be selling them by placing a sell order and not dumping. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:12:55
Mt Gox is not a problem. The level stupidity with crypto investors is absolutely astounding. Mt Gox could dump everything over night and would do nothing to the price. They simply don't have enough to effect the market. But because there's many many many many many many idiots in this market that can't do simple math or don't know what "Market Cap" even means, they get scared and dump as an effect from Mt Gox. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:33:21
The whole market was worth about 20bil that year. That's one day's volume in today's crypto

I strongly believe that the whole market is waiting for me to sell so it can take off. I am the chosen one! Millions of investors the market has chosen me to screw with.

I was clearly responding to the comment above. we'll maybe not clearly....but that's what i was referring to. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 01:52:23
ignorant is not the proper word. I meant they weren't intimidated or scared off by crash concerns so in a way it was a blissful ignorance. Today you pull anyone aside and asking them to invest in Bitcoin, chances are thy'll laugh and call it a scam because of the recent massive crash. So the avg person off the street is cautious about bitcoin but back in 2013 you had a better chance of convincing someone to invest. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:39:29
it's about trauma. Everyone and their mother heard about the recent crypto crash. I didn't even know crypto exsisted in 2013 but today crypto news is mainstream and the sentiment is that it has crashed. Incoming investors in 2013 were ignorant and that helped recover the price quickly. Incoming investors of 2018 are very well aware of what has taken place because it is all over the news and the media has cautioned people in so many ways against crypto. If we see BTC go up to 10k next month, I can gurantee you there will be major profit taking. Too many lost money to take a chance and hold for another higher wave. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:45:58
This is no longer "profit taking". people are selling at a loss. You have got to be the most retarded investor to be selling at these prices.

@_date: 2018-06-23 21:43:10
OH BTW, you're lying. It took 3 years for the price to recover. Not sure where you got 6 months from. Here's the graph:  In 2013 it reached $200, leveled at $100 about 7 months, then we saw a bull run to $1000, crashed over a 3 year period before finally recovering again. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:22:29
people don't treat $250 like 20k. It doesn't garnish as much attention by the media and/or shock/trauma. The higher it crashes from the more time it takes for it to recover. That's a fact. you can also argue that it went from 10c to 35c and crashed again.. but people weren't too traumatized about that. People are much more scared to invest today than when it crashed then, so it will take at least 3 years for it to get back to the ATH. GUARANTEED

@_date: 2018-06-24 02:03:41
yah perhaps, but what I know is crashing from 20k isn't going to be easy to recover from. It wasn't easy to recover from $1000 and sure as hell aint going to be easy to recover form 20k. 3 years is the magical number in the amazon crash, apple inc crash, and the first crypto crash from $1000 ,,, so why should this be different.

wow you're so right.
