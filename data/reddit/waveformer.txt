I used Swedish snus when drinking to fight the urge to smoke, and successfully quit a long time ago. 
... Although now I'm kinda addicted to Swedish Snus when I'm drinking. Tobacco is one sassy plant.

I only have $120 tied up, I posted on their twitter a week ago and was told I should see it in my bank account within 2 - 3 days. its been almost 8 days and still nothing. I am starting to come to terms with the fact that I will never see that money again. 
Even though its a small amount, I still hope that Roman gets a boot up his ass for the way he handled this situation, its beyond appalling.

yeah you definitely put it in perspective.
 I really hope they come through with this whole check thing. its funny I only moved my coins to bitfloor because Mt Gox was taking ages to approve my bank account and then the moment I do it, poof they shut down. 
hope you get your money out of there man.

closing down an exchange and not returning peoples money is more than simply working out a kink, its straight up by the book theft. I hope you are able to get your money back.
