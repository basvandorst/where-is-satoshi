Check this:  Some development is going on.

Wonderful, thanks! Some CNN news could be included as well, I think haha

Sounds sweet. Do you have any developers in mind or should I look for some on my side? I guess Reddit also could be a place to turn to, in case we don’t find anyone :)

Nice idea. I just have contact with a board game publishing company, so I thought it would be possible to get their assistance in publishing. Will see what I can do and where this would get!

Oh, I see! That’s even a better one, actually!

Actually, I’ve done some research and it appears they don’t patent the design.
Yeah, I agree it would be cool to have an app with a possibility to play online. Let’s estimate the costs of both versions - I’m for the physical one, you for the app based, and see where we get from there.

Haha, you see, I think the author of the design was placing the currencies according to their growth/popularity recently.

Well, that field could be easily replaced by Bitcoin. That’s an initial design, edit proposals are welcome.

No, for real. Because as far as I know, the income tax is also applicable to BTC

Thanks for such an in-depth answer! Will definitely check Nick’s views out

Sometimes it happens that those who believe in the philosophy of crypto also use the opportunity of gains. Often, I’d say.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:09:18
How was it with taxes?

It isn’t necessary to know. He had email, even reddit I think. It could be just a signal through media outputs, anything.
