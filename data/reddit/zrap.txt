Thats great. So, is the money of the system that bitcoin was created to replace now coming in to save the price, while it is not usable as it was intended to?
Oh, the irony.

yes. so glad we have this censorship here so we won't have to read other opinions (eh i mean bullshit and fud) and can stay safely within our bubble now. such a great subreddit, it was really annoying years ago. now we have all those great memes and infighting and twitter feed.
many thanks to the strong moderation policy -  really important for a good and vibrant community!

a) scaling solution in place
b) number of tx and people using bitcoin declining
