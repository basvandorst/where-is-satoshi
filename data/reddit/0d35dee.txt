personally I think they should have gone ahead and put an actual bch address after the editorialized "Bcash LOL" because the simple fact of the matter is a) every holder of BTC has BCH for the most part b) BCH actually got some value and c) they are presently cheap to move. so TPB is really just taking money off the table for themselves with this stance.

The purpose of Tether is to distract you from things that are important.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:30:00
Yeah for sure. Thinking about this more i realize that the more BTC a hub ties up in channels out to merchants, the less often it will have to close out those channels and re-open with new funds, thus better able to spread their on-chain tx fees out over time. I don't imagine the balances on the channels opened to merchants will really ever flow back towards the hubs unless they were doing payroll that way.

be aware that sometimes the person who initiated the transfer to your address may not be in direct control of the keys for the sending address. eg if it was sent out from someones exchange account then likely sending it back to that sending address would put it back in control of the exchange but not necessarily the individual user who sent it, so it might just go back to some other entity.

@_date: 2018-01-08 23:03:40
yeh, i think it would be cool to operate a hub that is connected to several big merchants and recoup any on-chain channel close related costs via relay fees. so you could encourage people to open a channel to _you_ because you are the most well connected hub with the most liquidity or something like that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:02:20

@_date: 2018-01-10 04:36:45
but people are charging no fees on testnet right? and on chain channel operations are cheap on testnet too, so its nothing to open channels up all over. And its pretty easy to tie up a lot of funds in a channel there and not worry about it because its just testnet.
i think that allows for one kind of structure but i suspect something different will emerge when there is quite a bit more money on the line, and things like liquidity to worry about as well as on chain transaction fees. people will need to be choosy about who they open channels to at least on BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:52:42

I think they decided it would set a bad precedent and wanted to offer solutions that fixed major issues and moved in the direction of a 2nd layer scaling solution instead. 
the fact that everyone who has BTC now also has BCH is kind of cool and fun. If BCH actually does end up being used before LN takes off then that's great.

bcash is one example spinoff project for when a subgroup did not agree with the rest of those in the consensus making process. segwit fixed malleability and opened the door for other new features, so many people wanted a fix for that stuff. i dont think its so much that core wants 1mb blocks as core wants to fix all the issues that are wasting space in 1mb blocks before making bigger blocks. core will increase block size eventually, but my prediction is it wont happen until after most on chain transactions are having to do with LN activity.

government will show a track record of failing to be able to pin a tax liability on an ever increasing percentage of social security numbers that exist in the wild. at some point they run out of resources to even attempt to enforce the liabilities that they've been able to prove in court. at some point further the government is defunded because people stop just voluntarily handing over what is now a difficult-to-extract-by-force base of wealth.

i think if over 90% of every on chain block is LN channel opens/closes then there would be enough pressure from everyone in the community to further increase the number of tx that can be fit in blocks. LN itself can theoretically scale indefinitely like the internet with alternative routing methods than the current method it uses. So it very much could be possible with just base layer + LN

i'm quite sure there will be a period of time where nobody is going to be getting a mortgage of any kind because banks will stop lending during the uncertain period when a hyperinflation sets in. if property changes hands it is going to be settled in cash or other things. someday after that, some bank institution new or old will figure out terms that make sense to loan deflationary money on, but i'm guessing not for houses. and by then house prices will be sensible again anyway.

My bank and all its partners are on board with the fake money central bank system. They agree to the rules and accept each others IOUs. So sure we can circulate numbers in a cheqing account, and we sure don't have to worry about the bank saying no if we want to withdraw all our money. We agree that the numbers in the bank account is money.
But your scenario with fake bitcoins that exchanges just make up that cannot be withdrawn to the blockchain shows that they can't circulate, because nobody will accept them. They can circulate within the exchange only. People who would just circulate fake bitcoins within an exchange without ever taking control of their funds could get burned, but this problem is for those people only and from their poor choices.

your scenario is a marginal one that is not the main mode of commerce where anyone will have issues getting refunds. yeah if you want to buy some thing from someone you have no relationship with over far distances you should use escrow. for everything else, like everything else in your entire life that you would pay cash for, food, rent etc, you know the people you are dealing with and you can get a refund same as with any other payment method. when i get a refund from walmart i go up to the counter and ask for a refund. that is the majority of peoples experience with refunds. getting refund on a bad ebay deal is like the tiniest part of the market, and yeah i'll agree with you on that you should use escrow with btc ... or paypal whatever.

i think a lot of people here find the idea of warming up to the tax man and buttering the ole butthole to be distasteful. some of us would rather use that money to pay for private mercenaries that will literally defend us with force against IRS goons.
but my take on the tax thing is, pay the taxes that you know they can prove you "owe" them in court. So anything where you are pretty sure your transaction was off the books and not part of a sting specifically targeting your tax avoidance should be fair game to forget about reporting on.
I would only report taxes on crypto I sold through an exchange that had my tax id. I'd take steps to disconnect other transactions from my tax id such that a jury would have reasonable doubt about my actual participation in transactions.

i'm skeptical that in a hundred years time fiat money will play much of a role in the world. it will likely live on in the form of privately issued fiat currencies like disney-bux or poker chips or equivalent, fun tokens that you have to use in the venue.

i think it is typical for a contractor to ask for some payment up front and if you have reputation you should be able to do that.
when i was contracting with sketchy people i did not ask for money up front, i pretty much did what you described. i would do some work and deliver it then ask for payment. i would not start work on the next part of the project until the last thing was paid. i kept doing this for years and it worked well and limited my risk exposure to at most a few hours of my time doing work.

i don't think its horrible to have some opportunity instead of no opportunity. if you think that price is too low, i'm sure you'll find it a snap to set up a competing factory and pay the workers better. maybe you'll be able to cause a general increase in wages through your benevolence. or maybe you'll go out of business because you'll find your competitors can sell their product cheaper by employing **willing workers who would rather not be subsistence farmers any more**
 ... and that somehow I'm supposed to think this is "horrible". no, I would rephrase by argument is basically “yes, it’s **reality** but he was in a position to **improve both his and their situation** so it’s fine if he paid them almost nothing because it’s not like they **really want to go back to subsistence farming**”

GPU will be able to perform sha256 by running miner code on it, however it is a general purpose processor so it can do many things but not super efficiently. Antminer and the like is a ASIC chip (application specific!) which can perform only a single function and designed to do it efficiently. So if you try to mine bitcoin with a GPU all you are going to do is enrich the electric company at your own expense.
Also word on the street is that Antminer is not the best bitcoin mining ASIC, there are models from competing companies that will provide better (more hashing for less electricity use) results.
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:27:29
because visual processing is like blockchains /s
anyway the real answer is that all the EV's are going to force upgrades to the power grid and maybe we'll even see neighborhood level cost effective power generation. Then the price of electricity can go down which will allow miners to profit more. Theres a logical answer.
oh also I heard the EV industry exists because of government subsidies and mandates of fleet efficiency not because the manufacturers want to make or can actually turn a profit from selling these things.

I agree with you. I expect very little from lazy masses except for their capacity to consume resources and to die. My aim is increasingly to insulate myself from people like that, to allow them to spend their time engrossed with celebrity gossip and the latest fad diets and whatever crap seems to appeal to the masses.
We are heading for a place that is very different than what anyone alive today has known for their lives. What we are heading for is a world that more closely resembles the path we were on before the nation state era began, before the monetary system worldwide was completely corrupted. And its not going to work out well for the 'lazy masses' in my opinion.
For those people in my life that I care about, I will go out of my way to help them adjust to what I predict will become the new reality. Everyone else frankly can get f****, if they arent willing to step up and try at least.

if i want it to get in the next block i need to take control over the fee yeah. and if the fee is too much for the transaction to make sense then i pick a better time to transact or use a different payment method. i always check the mempool and look at the min fee (sat/byte) by which transactions have been getting into the next block and then target that fee or slightly above.

if they tried to buy it the price would go up since lots of us are not willing to sell it all, and my last few would only be parted with for large swaths of land and salaries for the mercenaries i'd need to employ.
their only real option is to outmine the network but they better get started before the hashrate eclipses even their resource availability. at present last time i checked it would be about 1% of the DoD budget to buy the mining equipment to 51% attack. that budget portion will grow over time so they need to act quick. i suspect they will fail to act and nip this in the bud and then we will eat their lunch.

wealth inequality is not a problem. growth and consumption for its own sake is a problem though. I dont believe in the concept of political authority, and i question the motives of those that do.
Bitcoin will certainly become part of the geopolitical balance of power but not in the sense that you are thinking. It will unwind the very concept of political authority and centralized power structures.
Those that are in power will attempt to tax and suppress bitcoin, but their attempts to do so will be visible and in the end i suspect will be directly related to their undoing, because the fact that the emperor wears no clothes will be spelled out for all to see right in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:00:39
I usually just go look at this chart:
the color bands show the fees per byte that are in the mempool. every time the graph dips down its because a block dropped that included some of those tx. if you see what band got "eaten into" visually by the dip of tx being removed from mempool, you can get an idea of what you need to target. looking at todays graph i see that at the moment fees are quite high, would need to be 40 or 50 sat per byte to get in right now. however just last night at several points the tx with fees as low as 1 or 2 sat per byte were getting in. so cheap tx is totally possible just by being patient and these charts should give you an idea of how patient. other resources with a similar idea that i've referred to are such as  and this one i just found after wanting to give a more comprehensive response for you:

BTC is a form of debt about as much as a lump of gold or a barrel of oil is. none of these things satisfies the meaning of debt as you defined it, eg promises to pay you more in the future.

Revenue canada will know you have a tax liability when you sell the BTC at a Canadian exchange that you gave your social insurance number to. In no other situation can I imagine that they could know about your transaction. 
You can't be held liable for taxes on transactions that RCA can't know about. However, if you magically have cash on hand that RCA doesnt know about but you are spending it in ways that their agents can track you, it would be smart to report some 'income' and pay some small tribute for appeasement.

have you searched for the transaction being broadcasted? when you withdrew, did you get a tx id? you could look that up on a block explorer, it would show unconfirmed or confirmed. or look up by address you sent to. if the fee was low yours could just be stuck in mempool while higher priority txs are getting in blocks :/

Bitcoin is not backed by anything in the same way that gold is not backed by anything. And to be backed by something means you can take the token to the backer or his agent and demand the backing.
Eg, a gold backed currency would be convertible to a set amount of gold, on demand, any time.

I couldnt get through the whole thing because the author has a very bizarre and incorrect view of what money is so the rest of it was just reading like nonsense. I'd like to ask the author what a stock from a company is, or why does a piece of gold have value. Bitcoin was worth nothing at first, then some people started putting a price on it. Its just grown from there. And money has existed without government in the past, so not sure why they think government actually has any business meddling with the money supply.
Nobody is robbing the society or minting or counterfeiting anything. A new asset like a stock is being issued by a piece of software. If the market decides to value it I don't know why this guy things the government should get in the way. Anyone can just mine gold, is that not the exact same concept?

on chain vs off chain very much does matter. if it is never settled on the block chain, it doesnt exist. there is no reason in cannot be settled on the block chain in future, but until it is it is just ious floating around. WHICH IS FINE but denying this demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of what LN is and is not. 
i'm not trying to prove anything, i just asserted your 10 satoshis tips are insulting as a tip. as a tech demo, sure its cool but its also kind of pointless with such small amounts. seriously i suggest 1000 satoshis at least or its just an insult. maybe its cultural but a tip of less than a dollars worth of value is just a joke man. would you tip a nickel at a restaurant? would you give your barber a 25 cent piece? in what poor-ass corner of the world is a tenth of a us penny not an insult? no offense if you are from a very poverty stricken place man but if thats the case you need to keep your 10 sats to yourself so that you can afford to eat.

its true i'm apathetic. its also true that i really dont feel like i will need to 'buy more bitcoin' and any bitcoin transaction i do is going to be with people that dont know my government issued identity, so i am really not worried. if its really onerous for people to acquire bitcoin through an exchange then i suppose they'll just have to work under the table for me doing my bidding for satoshis. heh.

find the best exchange in your country (make sure, dont use some sketchy company), get registered on it, connect to your bank account, send them your btc, put a sell order in, sell the btc, withdraw the money to your bank account. remember to tell the tax authority about your capital gains or whatever other tax obligations you may be liable for as a result of turning bitcoin into national currency (aka making income or realizing gains or whatever) in your jurisdiction. also you might want to let your bank know before hand so that they dont get angry at you and think you are some kind of money launderer. you can put their mind at ease about the source of your money, eg old btc you mined. they may or may not care i dunno, but you hear stories. probably for only 2k they wont care. i think over about 9.5k they would start to raise eyebrows

god isnt nearly as real as the higher fees you'll pay for not using segwit. so for the love of "not wasting resources" ... which is I suppose my god.

No. they will go beyond that. they will Cyber kill him. it could be ugly.

I would prefer you to sore or kore

so buy land and companies instead. create jobs. raise armies. etc.

about what? coin join? tangling the graph? sending coins to myself? making new addresses? using exchanges that dont do kyc? in person swaps? atomic swaps on LN? chain analysis is not going to save governments. not to mention nobody is going to respect or believe some governments bullshit assertion of 'evil btc addresse' or whatever the end game is.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:13:33
ppl will use segwit and batching etc if they want to save money. people will use ln too. i predict that some day most onchain tx will consist of batched ln channel operations

why are you online dating on foreign sites? if you can't meet locally in person then whats the point? the only thing that is going to come from some long distance relationship started over the internet where you never meet the person is that you will end up emotionally and financially drained. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:16:17


what does that even mean? 
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:57:35
about 1% of the DoD annual budget is what i came up with last time i ran the numbers based on mining equipment costs and hash rate. so yeah, if they want to kill it, they need to do it before the hashrate goes up by two more orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:32:24
i just hope it goes down before i get paid not after.
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:40:35
does this compare in any way to the 'canonical transaction ordering' i remember hearing about a few months ago over on that other sub? is it trying to solve a similar problem?
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:28:47
lol yeah some mysterious they is conspiring against the bitcoin. or it could just be supply and demand. you can't know what motivations actors have in this market. anyway, paper bitcoins that dont exist dont cause problems when the bitcoin economy functions on actual transactions in the blockchain. if enough people really thought it was possibly a problem then people could prove that a certain amount of bitcoin (x) that exists is held outside of these big scary institutions, meaning that no matter what, big scary institutions could at most control 21M-x bitcoins.

drugs are fun. government trying to stop fun creates systemic catastrophe.

i am very much appreciative of LNBig and their channel opening service. through it i have been able to test many things with payments and routing on the main net.

i think he is suggesting that now in 2018 crypto is a larger part of their business. is it the largest? i dunno, that would make this super relevant. if it is less than the largest, then here is just some shitty shitpost.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:05:44
sounds like you need a wallet. if you say what os you want to use it on, people can suggest to you their favorite wallet. i have used bitcoin core on windows and mycelium and samourai on android. there are many others to choose from as well.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:18:17
there is no cheque. the nature of our relationship requires him to send me money internationally. i choose this method. its a roller coaster. i could give him the deposit address to an exchange if it was something that deeply concerned me and wasnt just a crazy roller coaster ride.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:20:23
tough call, its either this or rai stones, i havent decided yet
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:31:20
Go for it. Just dont put in more than you are prepared to lose. This could go to zero. It could also go the other way.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:19:21
10 years goes by ... oh look my gmail accounts still works. oh look that wallet.dat file is still there. oh and i still remember the decryption key because i've been reciting it in my head daily. i'll just download bitcoin core now ...
have you no imagination?
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:56:11
if it displaces a good chunk of the gold market it could easily get up into that territory and beyond.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:44:24
i agree.
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:23:03
can't rehypothecate whatever isn't in your vault.
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:35:37
politically the only viable way forward is to do more with less. if block size was to be reduced it would have to somehow simultaneously allow an increase of transaction throughput.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:27:16
seconded. i like to know how many real world shit my magic internet money will buy. idc if you make me tap secret corners or something to show it and it goes away after 5 sec
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:13:53
the concept of a country is presently relegated to that of favorable jurisdiction. their role will continue to erode. the old powers that had control of the future of this world are out of touch and perhaps havent realized that it has all slipped through their fingers now.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:51:46
i know it can be confusing if you are new to the space but anyone can open a business with the word bitcoin in the name, like localbitcoin and then scam people.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:50:42
anything can be a thing if you are willing to suspend disbelief.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:34:34
imagine a world where the concept of countries is an anachronism
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:21:02
no i only heard of stories where stupid criminals gave their keys to authorities by accident.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:53:23
it would make it hip and cool and popular with the youth, thats for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:21:40
the carrier should be liable. they gave his phone number to the attacker.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:19:20
my rate has always been quoted in USD with this client, so yes. i give him an invoice with a USD amount and he then uses a service to pay me the BTC value to the address i give him.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:41:03
if we assume the average transaction size is about 250 byte, then 1 sat per byte is 250 sats, which in current USD value is about 2 cents.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:02:55
I started taking my pay exclusively in BTC a few months ago. the ride down from 6400 has been rough. i feel like ive been catching a falling knife. next invoice comes out soon, hope the price doesnt go down again right after.

its a collection of atoms assembled in the form of an artistic "bit coin" logo on a coin shaped form factor with pretend microchips and stuff on the back. looks cool. whats it made of?
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:29:12
i think its possible that this is the final pump. depending on what the central banks and their puppets do, they could end up falling on their own swords before they ever thought possible. we could end up with a meaningless price and a world that abandons central banking, within mere years.

CEO vs tech person is not often overlapping skill set. most execs have to be psychos to be any good anyway. fucked up world we made.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:22:56
the only thing he can be referring to is sting operations where they intercept someone operating a decrypted hot wallet and before the operator can trigger a dead-man switch. like what happened to Ross
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:43:53
has the semi conductor industry reached the maximum gate density that it ever will? what about phtonics?
