So, at 2:20pm today, you bought BTC from this guy at the rate of £375/BTC, when the market rate at the time was £330/BTC, and then you paid him an extra 3% commission?
Good work.

Why is it a decent indicator? What fundamental (rather than technical) support is there for the current price?


You don't give a number either. Do you care to provide one?


I can't see that you have provided any arguments against the comparison. Tulips have utility and so do bitcoins. The price during the tulip mania was driven by technicals rather than fundamentals.
Unless you can provide some kind of fundamentals, then you have provided no argument that the price is not disconnected from them.

There is no recorded association between the private key and the public key. Instead the private key is used to generate a signature, which can then be verified with the public key.
Without going into the details of public key cryptography, a given private key is the only key that could generate a signature that can be verified by a given public key. 
So, if you can generate a signature that the public key verifies, you must have the private key.

In theory you could be caught holding the bag, unless you have hedged (and then you need to add the cost of the hedge into the transaction costs).
Big arbitrage players spend a lot to reduce the lag between trades, which reduces the risk and also increases the chance of catching an arbitrage opportunity (as a price mis-match may only last for a very short time). For example, by getting their equipment on fast connections, very close to the exchange.
A bid/offer spread of 500-700 (for example) is not an arbitrage opportunity, because you can buy at 700 and sell at 500.
A bid price of 700 on one exchange and an offer price of 500 on another exchange, would be an arbitrage opportunity. Because you could then buy at 500 and sell at 700.
If you can execute both trades at exactly the same time the risk is, in theory, zero.
Every millisecond thereafter does introduce a risk (if not hedged).

Yes, you have made that claim. But what evidence have you provided to back it up?
If you can't explain why they should be worth X, then it is meaningless for you to say that less that X is "undervalued", and if it is more than X it is "overvalued".




I can only assume from your response, that you don't understand my post.


Again, you seem to fail to grasp how ridiculous it is for you to say that something is "undervalued", and then to claim that it is impossible to calculate its value with any degree of certainty.

You are all missing the point!
If Chuck Norris wanted to, he could out hash all existing computing power using just his fingers (on one hand)...
He could bring down BTC with a 51% attack, while watching Storage Hunters...

If the two trades cannot (at least theoretically) be placed at the same time, then it would not be considered arbitrage.
However, if you could buy on one exchange at $500 and then sell on another exchange for $700 several days later, it would (as you say) look a little like arbitrage.
But a 500-700 spread on a single exchange is never going to even look like arbitrage, because you have the opportunity to buy at $700 and sell at $500, rather than buy at $500 and sell at $700 (as in the previous example).

Oh, and what about my savings?
Do you seriously expect me to hold them in BitCoin?

It's just something that people like to tell themselves.
If you had an asset that had a value of $1000 and it now has a value of $400, you have certainly lost $600 of value.
But it might make you feel better to tell yourself that you never had that value (just because you never transferred it to cash).

Right now the Mt. Gox ask is $480 and the BitStamp bid is $631.
So, in theory you could buy on Mt. Gox at $480 and sell later on BitStamp at $631.
Of course, that requires two big assumptions.
Firstly, that people will still be willing to pay $631 when you finally get your coins to BitStamp.
Secondly, that you will ever be able to get your coins out of Mt Gox.
The huge price difference is presumably the market pricing in the risk of never getting the coins out of Mt Gox.

It's a shame that the price you paid seems to have been quite far from the price you could have paid on an exchange.
As far as I can tell, the price quoted on BitStamp at the time you made the purchase was no more than $590/BTC (and possibly quite a bit less), whereas the ATM charged you $621.
OK, you only bought $20 worth, so it isn't a big deal for you, but a 7% "fee" is a bit much for the convenience of using an ATM.
The problem is that people using these ATMs may assume that they are paying the market rate, and end up feeling cheated.
I have seen worse though. I remember seeing an article a some time ago with one of the first ATMs selling physical gold. People were obviously buying small quantities, and had perhaps not realised that the were paying close to $3000/oz when the spot price at the time was around $1900.
The advertising was making big claims about the future price of gold (especially given that the buyer would have needed more than a 50% rise in the price of gold to break even).

This is the problem. 
If you don't want government protection for you and your family, then make absolutely sure you are tougher than all the bad guys.
If you don't want government protection for your bitcoins, then make absolutely sure that you are smarter than all the bad guys.
If you aren't sure that you are tougher or smarter than all the bad guys, and want that protection, then it comes with regulation.

You're right in saying that it is difficult to buy close to international market rate in the UK.
Localbitcoins might enable you to buy at 5-6% above.
Other than that best way at the moment would be to use a foreign exchange and convert your sterling. You would still end up paying much, much less than 16%.
It's disappointing that this London store seems to charge so much, because it won't help with adoption.

Given that Krugman has a Nobel Prize in Economics...aren't people being somewhat hasty in declaring that he "doesn't get bitcoin"?
Isn't it far more likely that he is smarter and more informed than probably everyone on this forum?
Isn't it also far more likely that he is right, and they are wrong, but that they just don't understand why he is right?

And what am I supposed to do for food in the meantime? 
Do I starve, or do I eat out three times a day at the only coffee shop that takes bitcoin in a 50 mile radius?
How do I buy fuel?
Or perhaps I should save the environment at the same time, and spend 8 hours a day walking to my job and back.
How do I buy electricity?
Or do I just go to bed when the sun goes down?
...and don't give me "BitPay" as the answer...that is paying in dollars, not BitCoin!

Like any product it may or may not turn out to be vaporware.
But the claim that:
"you will be not limited by features, because everything will be scriptable"
is one that I have seen made many, many times, usually announced with much excitement as if it is a revolutionary idea.
Hopefully, the people working on this have previously experienced all the practical problems that come along with the "everything is scriptable" approach.

Well, no, even if just one person stole the whole amount, and he can launder it for free.
* A very nice NY penthouse apartment - 200,000 BTC
* A very nice private jet - 100,000 BTC
* A few other very nice houses dotted around the world - 200,000 BTC
* Say $6000 expenses per day for the next 50 years - 200,000 BTC
...and you could easily find a way to spend the other 150,000 BTC
It doesn't matter how much money you have, there are always ways to spend it.


You expect him to give up 750,000 BTC ($412M) in the hope that his 100,000BTC ($55m) then appreciate by at least 650%? :)
If I was him, I think I would just hold on to the whole lot.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:04:43


It's a way for them to pay 16% above market rate.


I'm sure he's hoping for plenty more like you.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:59:18




16% is a ridiculous rate to pay.
Perhaps it's OK if you are being gouged when changing money at the airport, but you wouldn't pay that on an international bank transfer (as yes I have done many).
If you are trying to invest in BitCoin it's massive, especially if you later pay the same to convert it back.
If you are converting it to purchase goods with, you've already paid far more than you would ever pay in transaction costs with fiat money.




Yes, but he is (presumably) charging the same rate to everyone.
Some people are ill informed about the market rate, which is why gold vending machines manage to get customers when charging 40% above the market rate.
Those vending machine owners are hoping that there are enough suckers, who won't work out what the rate should be, and will instead trust that the company is charging close to the market rate.
The only people who will use this London Bitcoin guy are people who are buying very small amounts just for the fun/experience (like you), or ill-informed people who assume that they will be paying close to market rate.
Not good for Bitcoin adoption.
It would be much cheaper for anybody who is trying to buy a reasonable amount to convert sterling to, say euros or dollars, and by on a foreign exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:24:44


Yes, the point being that that you could get through 850,000 BTC quite easily even if (as I said above) you could launder it for free.
But you're right, of course, he can't launder it for free.
Poor guy...might have to go for an entry level jet, and commute in from New Jersey :)
