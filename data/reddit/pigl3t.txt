Done. Slimy buggers shooting themselves in the foot on this one.

3M per bitcoin would put bitcoin market cap close to ALL THE MONEY (cash and bank accounts) that exists! In 5 years? Chill dude.

Good luck retiring on 210k dude! Or are you in your 50's or 60's?

Congratz to us Brisbanites!

Timezone?

Trade. Short in an exchange. Hedge in other coins or fiat if that's what you're into. Not for the weak of heart.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:59:57
Thanks mate. Someone had to ask.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:32:01
As if it isn't relevant ya silly billy!
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:35:38
Probably. Thats up to the market. I think more than halve but that's me.
@_date: 2017-01-04 05:12:08
That was his point I think. That somethings value doesn't relate to its 'wiki worthiness'.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:47:04
No air. Need waaaaaaaay more surface area.

Aren't these 2 posts contradictory?

"Don't invest what you can't afford to lose" is a very common phrase on this sub.

I saw this post and immediately after my gf rocked up with a six pack of VB's!

I think he ment a magic staff. Like a wooden pole usually with a magic stone or artifact on the end of it.

Wow 25 million is way more than 5! 
@_date: 2017-01-18 09:35:33
Thought so.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:15:45
This Is amazing. Thank you ya legend.

It would be difficult to move an entire continent but then again bitcoin never ceases to amaze!
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:06:19
Hey i have a measley 1.2 as well! Still kicking myself for not getting more at 500. I guess if you can afford to buy now why not. I'm a long term optimist.  rule,  prepare to lose your investment! Never all in!

I don't think he created bitcoin to make a profit. Pretty sure he was/is passionate about it. If EVERYONE did everything purely for profit the world would be a bleak af place.
@_date: 2017-04-01 01:37:16
I think it's more than that because they are also bitcoin players. It's relevant because it's about the pool's stance as much as it is about litecoin. Worth a mention on this sub imho. It probably just be a big ol joke anyway so....

Apparently they stopped doing those years ago :(

Holy moly! Seems like you have some literacy problems of your own mate. I recommend reading the comments above again.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:29:56
Yeah the spread turns out ok for selling though. Pretty bad for buying.
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:33:36
Well of you're "certain" then get another loan and buy even more BTC bruh!

I guess 2400 in 2 months seems a little too optimistic. Fimgers crossed though.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:05:43
And 54k a year is slightly higher than average salary in USA is it not?

Hmmmmm. This seems like more than a mediocre lifestyle mate. Average houses here (similar to the states) cost half that a month. Food would cost more though. Very few people retire with more than a million bucks.

There are many cultures within China. I imagine there are hundreds of vastly different cultures within the other 47 countries in Asia. Saying "it's an Asian thing" is an outrageously simple and redundant statement that means pretty much nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:54:59
Yeah I know mate. Just having a laugh. I still love using it to pay for things. Feels so empowering! Oh and sci-fi af.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:34:46
Don't remind me. The amount of games I've got for what's now worth 200+ dollars.
