Can I propose near-instant transactions with a fixed tiny satoshi fee (e.g. 50 satoshi and reduced as btc gets more expensive). Also mining can be done in a way Ark/Rise are doing it (voting for a delegates etc); surely using up the power which equals to something like 1,000,000 US homes is just awful...?

ethereum, litecoin, iota, ripple, ark, hell, even electroneum is probably much faster and WAY cheaper at transferring funds.

it says that my tx should be forgotten after 3 days but it's been 8 now...

because after 10 years we'd need terabytes, if not petabytes, worth of storage on any pc with a full wallet?

it'll be a good store of value for people who hope to make some nice 2-10x+ gains

My rule is to buy more omg when it dips below $10 (probably won't happen again). I am certain omg will shoot up to over $100 at some point this year. I am also trying to accumulate 10 neo since it's better than ether in many ways and has a lower supply

sourced or a guess?
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:30:49
That's a pretty hardcore hodl
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:55:04
if you hodled from 12 months or more ago things like ethereum and neo you would still be smiling a fair amount

People dying is always really good for my portfolio!

That's so delusional.

This is why there is no point to invest btc, first of all it's not going to grow as much as other crypto, secondly, it's wasteful because of stupid ASICs (other crypto is WAAAAY more efficient. Thirdly, the community is full of rude assholes like you. Fuck you and your bitcoin. Fail to adapt = fail. It's only a matter of time when a better crypto overtakes bitcoin and I am happy to wait.
