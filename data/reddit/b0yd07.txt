Well, I bought at 11,500, then doubled down to get it averaged at 10,700. 
$8300 of my investment turned into $5300 in a month LMAO. Going to try to make it back in the stock market. Will take a long time for sure but I have more faith in recovering the 3k in established companies than I do in btc tbh. Hodl at 1k loss. Hodl at a 2k loss. Not sticking around for the 3k loss to turn into a 4,5,6k loss.... which I half expect it to. 
Also I’m incredibly tired of checking the price every 20 minutes just to be crushed over and over and over again. Not worth the stress.

Good luck to you!! I’d like to see btc recover even if it means I lost 3k even when I didn’t have to. But I can’t handle it anymore I’m weak!!

I bought in at 10,700 a month ago and just sold it today for 6,830.  Need the money unfortunately. Owned it for less than a year obv. 
How does tax work for this?
Do I do anything besides write it off as a loss in TurboTax? Someone is trying to tell me it’s considered income because I invested and sold it all within a year.

Ooooookay. -40% return in a month doesn’t bother you I guess. Coupled with the India news as well.

Capital gains specifically (1y plus), or any short term gain?

I lied a little bit, I can afford to lose it... But my faith in it has shaken tremendously. The bottom is where....... 2k? Where does it stabilize? It’s so volatile that it’s affecting me mentally. I’m much more comfortable being in the stock market with a more reasonable risk vs reward.

Thanks for that.
