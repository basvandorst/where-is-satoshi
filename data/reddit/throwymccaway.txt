Honest opinion, in the mid-to-long term Bitcoins best chance for relevance is as a first-adapter, limited quantity, e-currency serving as a peg or reserve currency to better designed e-currencies.  It would be ideal for BTCers, but really damn unlikely in my opinion.  To me the much more likely alternative is that BTC becomes worthless, or a near worthless niche.  But that's just my opinion, downvote or bookmark to rub it in my face in 20-50 years if you feel so inclined.

Mind if I ask when you got in?

All of it?  If you don't mind me asking, how much and why?

You tell me Gaby, why do I want bitcoin to fail?

Look, I'm OP, I'm not a dick, I'm a faggot, please get it right next time.  Seriously though, didn't mean to offend, I was just genuinely curious.  My apologies.

No, I prefer Indians.

Is that the entirety of your savings?
edit- it's a different username than the one that initially responded.  It was genuine question seeking clarification, not an attempt to be a dick.

To be honest, I'm not expecting an orwellian future at all, but hypothetically, if it were destined to be otherwise, I'm confused/curious as to how bitcoin would prevent it.  Would you mind explaining?

How long do you plan on holding on to the $6k?  Do you have a price (high or low) at which you would get out?  
Just as a general point, I'm usually very tentative to ask about personal finances, so I apologize in advance if it's too personal (to you or anyone else in this thread for that matter), but I'm genuinely curious.
