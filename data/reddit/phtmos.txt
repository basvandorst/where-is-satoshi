Thanks, this part actually helped me understand.
Other comments put me under the impression that he tweeted the hash of something which happened to also be the hash of a private key that was used prior to the tweet. And this didn't make sense to me.
From your comment I infer that the actual chronological order was the reverse which does make sense.

A toy company! Amazing idea! Someone should actually make it if it doesn't exist yet. An RPG board or video game where the player is the founder of a company and grows it to world domination to win, or to bankruptcy to lose.

That's really cool!
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:02:35
Is it normal that a hash of something is the same as the hash of a used bitcoin private key, if that something is not the private key itself?

Would misbehaving drivechain miners have any impact on the main chain?

or others could you please provide some critique? Thanks!

He was clearly sarcastic. The blockchain IS a ledger.
@_date: 2016-01-29 13:57:42
Thanks for the quick response. Right, it's in there indeed!
But I think that, regardless of what each member of the community thinks about its technical importance, its overall (perceived) significance for Bitcoin is too large to not emphasize that part of the roadmap more, and to not include the specific conditions that Core devs think need to be met for such a hard fork to be deployed.
Specifically, I think it would be for the benefit of Bitcoin to define:
* criteria defining the threshold of readiness for such a hard fork
* estimated (rough) range of time it would take before its deployment
and include them both in the [FAQ]( and in some more lengthy document/roadmap, with a clear statement that this is indeed going to happen in the foreseeable future.
What do you think, @_date: 2017-03-02 22:52:25
"those who are". No comma.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:32:19
In pruning mode, does it only download the N last MB, or it still has to download the whole block chain, deleting as it goes?
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:49:01
Completely off topic, but "phenomenon" is the correct singular form. "phenomena" is the plural form. Same for "criterion" vs "criteria".

Thanks a lot for taking the time for these posts.
It appears that there are some benefits regarding scalability and, perhaps more importantly, additional ones regarding confidence and integrity in Bitcoin and its community, stemming from a hypothetical inclusion of a future hard-fork increase in the limit, in the roadmap.
The problems with a hypothetical hard-fork are the safety issues in case of insufficient preparation prior to deployment, and its controversiality. Both issues are resolved by inclusion of the hard-fork, along with any necessary safety precautions, in Core's roadmap.
So, if the above statements are correct, simply including a block size limit increase hard fork in Core's roadmap would be highly beneficial for Bitcoin.
Do you disagree?
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:52:49
Thanks. It would be nice if a future version didn't have to download everything but instead downloaded only the last N MB if that option is chosen.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:46:49
Thanks for the answer.
1. Regarding your statement on experimentation, I infer that you think CT could or should be first experimented on on a public sidechain before Extension Blocks. Correct?
2. Extension Blocks become ultimately mandatory for users to validate, so would contribute to full node centralization, a worse form of centralization than miner centralization, contrary to a sidechain.
3. A hashrate majority attempting to steal coins from a sidechain implies:
   1. Either the sidechain is useless, so it's fine to prune it (miners think the chain will never generate them any fees - useless, in which case it's good for Bitcoin to prune it, and there are \~0 funds on it anyway)
   2. Or miners are economically irrational (to attack it for 3-6 months in drivechain's model, forsake all TX fees, drop BTC's exchange rate, and have their theft likely UASFed before they accomplish the theft). In this case, Bitcoin's security assumptions are not met anyway. Irrational miners will first 51% attack the main chain itself. And for a 51% attack of 3 months they could basically double spend almost all BTC in circulation. Sidechain theft is the least of our problems at that point.
4. &amp;


The hypothetical risk of theft you see concerns only sidechain users, other Bitcoiners are insulated. So preventing these users from using it is what seems unacceptable according to Bitcoin's ethos. Would you similarly promote blacklisting addresses owned by entities that you or me don't like? The ethical strategy is to allow users to do whatever their risk appetite tells them, but provide education - like this discussion -  so that they are well informed about the risks.

Just a couple links to answer your question:
- Vox: [Greece vacation: The Greek debt crisis is a good opportunity for a trip](
- The Guardian: [The weather is just as stunning as it ever was this time of year; the archaeological sites just as interesting; the beaches just as magical; the food just as heart-healthy. The prices are significantly cheaper than usual. It is one of those rare everybody-wins situations.](
- [The Athens International Airport, together with greek airline companies offer tickets between 0 and 10 € if you buy the ticket and fly between 13.07 and 26.07 (linked article in Greek)](
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:40:20
Thanks for the clarification. I understand what you mean, and it's fair. 
However, I think that saying it inherently permits stealing is not representative of reality (see my points above). It's like saying Bitcoin inherently doesn't solve the double spend problem. It's true, but it's also true that incentives prevent miners from centralizing and then from double spending. Very similar incentives prevent miners from stealing sidechain funds. Possibly stronger incentives in this case, given the at least 3 month long duration of the attack, and the possibility of soft forking the theft out before it completes. 
Btw thanks for all your work on Bitcoin. We all owe you.
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:15:09
Just a correction: drivechain doesn't require an opcode anymore. It does require a soft fork. It's BIP 300 and 301.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:52:15
Talking about peer-to-peer, public sidechains, as the term sidechain originally meant. Drivechain being the only proposed and working implementation I know of. See Pieter's answer: [
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:45:27
Wouldn't a sidechain be preferrable to Extension Blocks?

I did check, and I did have it when I uninstalled. But then I was attacked by the "mother cleaning up the room" vector. She even tore the back-up in pieces and put them in different public trash cans as it turns out...
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:32:02
May be, may be not.
Notice that the scale of each curve is normalized by the curve's max, so you can compare different points on the same curve, but not between curves.
edit: In fact that's a coincidence, and I was wrong, as pointed out below by @_date: 2017-09-22 20:38:22
I saw your comment and I thought this kind of coincidence would be improbable. So I went to check. Thinking that I shouldn't dedicate too much energy to a troll (that was you in my suspicious head), I wrote "candy" instead of "candy cane".
And lo and behold, the evidence pointed towards you being indeed a troll. [Candy peaks also at 100!](
But wait... What if.. you were not trolling! :-O
Let's check candy cane.. And you are not trolling! [Candy cane peaks much lower!](
Believe it or not, Justin Bieber, candy, and Bitcoin's google search bubbles topped at the exact same point this year. And this double coincidence was discovered because I happened to look for "cane" and not "candy cane". And because you happened to look for "candy cane" and not "popsicle" or sth. This makes it a quadruple coincidence, so I think the universe is trying to tell me that one of the coincidences has to break. I.e. the top for bitcoin is clearly not in yet! I'm buying, now. 
TL;DR: is right, my previous comment above is wrong, the world is weird, buy bitcoin :P

False reporting. At most 8% care about bitcoin. 8% are interested in using "blockchain", "e.g. bitcoin".
See [Accenture's original report]( page 9.
What's "over 60%" is how many SMEs are interested in some value-added service.

The fact that people use it with opposite meanings doesn't mean they use it correctly in both cases.
However, thanks for the note. Didn't know it's common to be used in this sense. I should thank my environment for their correct usage of English, and make sure to clarify the intended meaning when I come across it on the internet.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:35:06
IMHO, that's a widely held view that is supported not by facts, but by a combination of marketing and FUD-spreading, perpetuated by people who either misunderstand the technologies, or hope to profit from this perpetuation.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:57:36
These short-term psychological effects are important to the market, but the fundamental improvement to the technology is more important long-term. So I'd say, BTFD if the plunge you foresee does happen :)
