It’s not about saving money, it’s about making money ...
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:28:11
While this is good advice if time is not a factor, being able to by £5k worth of Bitcoin instantly can make you have better profits than waiting 2-3 days for a SEPA transfer to come through. That 2-3 days worth of price movement can equate to much more profit than the 4% charge from Coinbase. 
I’ve used Coinbase to buy £5k worth of Bitcoin on a 15% dip and made a lot more money on the rebound than waiting 2-3 days for the SEPA and missing the boat ... 
It’s also less riskier than leaving £5k on an exchange for the ‘just in case’.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:25:45
Due to the potential charge back, that would be very sketchy indeed

It’s likely that it will still arrive in your wallet, just at the other address - unless updating it, changed the wallet somehow. In which case you would need to re-seed it.

Your coins are never stored on a device, in any wallet.  Coins don’t actually exist. It’s just an annotation on a digital ledger. The private key - which basically lays claim to the annotation on the ledger - is what is stored securely in your wallet.
No key, no access to change the ledger, so you can’t move them, meaning they are un-spendable

Nationwide will send to Coinbase, usually happens for me within 24 hours, costs £4 and Coinbase charges 0.15 cents.
I use Gdax though (part of Coinbase) as it’s then free to move your bitcoin from the exchange.

Segwit2x will either not happen or it will add replay protection, give everyone some free $$$ and then die off.
I see no credible scenario where Segwit2x become dominant.
There is no appetite for it from the community and no miner is going to put their hard earned cash on the line to mine a coin that is 1/4 the price of bitcoin and only going to go lower.

One days it will be a spendable currency (in the Fiat sense), but not just yet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:54:46
Well it looks to me as though it hasn’t been sent.
This could because you gave them the wrong address, or because they haven’t yet sent it, or they sent it on the wrong address.
Either way, you need to speak with someone and confirm all the details are correct and if it’s their fault get your money back or ask them to resend correctly.
There have been some delays in transactions, but they should have paid enough to have it sent by now. It’s safe to say that it should be there. They themselves should be able to see that the transaction has not succeeded. It’s a public blockchain after all ;)
Good luck!

It’s a tough call and something everyone has to weigh up themselves. I’m still not convinced that the fork will happen. And I don’t think that any major (40%+) negative price action will happen if it does.
I have bought some, but kept a large pile of cash available to buy any meaningful dip. It might test 6k again, but it might not - it is Bitcoin after all.

It really needs to drop to about $4800/$5100 in order for it to retrace healthy and for us to move upwards without the need to revisit this range again

None, so long as the addresses are input correctly and your keys are safe
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:30:45
No, not an asshole; but it’s incredibly difficult to use TA on bitcoin, it just doesn’t work like regular stocks. It could very well retrace back to $5500 levels or continue up to 10k unhindered.
Either way, even with a harsh 40% retrace, it’s a safe bet for a new ATH early next year, if not before. And long term, a winner.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:52:46
Not with a CASH future.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:14:48
No, it bounced, twice off the 50% Fibonacci retracement, and had the volume to support it.
I think that was the ‘dip’ and we can move up from here. $6200 -$6900 is the new range: a break from either side will be the new trajectory. Break down $6100 and we may test 5500 again.

Yeah, so you are not allowing others to access your node. That’s only useful for you to run a wallet, but doesn’t benefit the rest of the network.

You can put that seed in to another version of bread or another wallet that supports a 12 Word seed and it will regenerate the private key giving you access to your Bitcoin.

Not everyone is talking about it. Move outside your circle ⭕️ and you will see that hardly anyone knows about bitcoin as it is now, are still stuck in the old mindset of its ‘its for criminals’ and would never invest.
Wall Street however have just woke up to the idea and are itching to get in ... that’s why the price is rising and why it will continue to soar.
A bubble suggests no underlying value, bitcoin has lots of underlying value.
No money ‘exists’ in the world. Things are only money if we give them value. Those paper notes in your wallet are only valuable for as long as people accept them, intrinsically they are valueless, just like Bitcoin.

You should never trust anyone you don’t really know. Bitcoin is about proof, not trust.
But I’d rather have faith in a group of developers who have consistently provided solid code, developed a 100b $ product while maintaining consensus; than a few guys who lie (fake satoshi), have criminal records (Ver) and are motivated purely by profit (Jihan) - and collectively act without consensus and in the manner of for profit/personal gain business (which bitcoin is meant to avoid).
Many other coins do what BCH is trying to do (big blocks don’t scale for the ‘coffee enterprise BCH sells itself as) and most of them do it better.
No one does Bitcoin better than Bitcoin and it’s unlikely that they will (but never say never, hey)

Beneficiary is Coinbase, IBAN is given to you, Amount (easy) when is (today) and the description would be where you put your reference number.
The reference number is the most important as it’s how the money gets to your Gdax account. On the next page of your bank you should be able to confirm the transaction so on that page check what other fields there are to fill in before confirming.

@_date: 2017-11-03 19:40:40
If you leave your bitcoin on an exchange, it’s up to the exchange whether they give you a 1/1 for your bitcoin. You don’t own the bitcoin unless you own the keys. Coinbase have said they will do this.
If you remove the bitcoin from Coinbase and own the keys (by storing it on a wallet) at the time of the fork your key will work on both chains giving you 1/1 of each - but you will need to wait to understand the process of separating them: this takes time and it’s advisable not to do any transactions for a while as you could lose your coins by spending on one chain.
If you have a low investment then leaving on an exchange is fine: but they do get hacked and you can lose your coins.
If you have a high investment then it’s usually safer to remove them and look after them yourself, which of course as it’s own risks (such as losing the keys)
Hope that helps.

Don’t worry about the fork, it won’t really affect you. After it happens (if it happens) you will have $200 invested on both chains - although its highly unlikely that both chains will be worth $200 for you, though it’s safe to assume that one of them will be.

For the EU, I use Krakken. They are a bit clunky when purchasing - I have found them slow, at times unresponsive and the last time I bought it said the transaction had not gone through, when it had and I bought twice: that being said, I’ve never had any security issues with using them for SEPA transfers or bitcoin transfers - which for me is the main thing.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:45:50
I recommend Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:56:50
Best thing you have going for you is you know you made a mistake and you know how you made a mistake. This means you can learn from it.
My advice:
Buy the bitcoin ... then, to protect yourself move it from the exchange to a wallet and hide the keys in a place you visit rarely but have secured access to (parents house for example) ... under no circumstances move it back to the exchange or to another site.
If you can afford a hard wallet (ledge Nano s) buy one and keep it on there - it’s harder to move and more effort to spend.

In one year of mining with a USB stick expect to mine approx $0.75c worth of BTC. The 2W of power you need will cost more annually than that.

I can’t give financial advise, but from a personal perspective, bitcoin and block chain tech is new, it’s going to be big and now is the time to get in before Wall Street and the masses.
What would you do if you could travel back in time to 2001 and buy 10 Google shares. Would you? You are now in that time-zone, but with Bitcoin. Your not the first to arrive at the party, but you are still very early!

The chain is copied exactly, so if you had bitcoin when they formed (and it’s debatable as to when they was/is) then you have the same coins on the new chain. It doesn’t matter where they are, but if you have them on an exchange, because you don’t technically own the coins, it’s up to the exchange whether they give you them
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:48:32
I’ll try Coinbase ...
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:05:40
First of all, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to buy a whole bitcoin through an exchange all in one go due to initial trading limits. Therefore:
Go to amazon and buy yourself a Ledger Nano S now as you’ll need it later.
Choose an exchange, like Coinbase, Bitfinex etc and transfer $1,000.00.
When your funds are credited, buy $250.00 worth of bitcoin.
Practice moving it to your ledger.
Once your comfortable with the process, transfer more funds,
Repeat the above process until you have your bitcoin.
The process is called dollar-cost-averaging and a newbie to the scene, it’s your safest way of buying a full coin.
Once you have it. Store the ledger and your seed in separate secure locations and stir back on your trip to the moon
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:38:59
Sure! But be specific, I’d need to write an essay to answer the original question ...

10% is just a standard fee from the machine vendor (from those I’ve seen and read about) I’ve never bought (but seen) from one so I’m not sure about the full process. If it goes straight in to your wallet then it’s not too bad, but only in small amounts.

@_date: 2017-10-01 19:56:17
Only you can can decide when to buy. If you are looking at Bitcoin for the long term, now is a good time to buy. You could wait for a dip, but there is no signal I can see that this will happen again, all the fear, uncertainty and doubt is priced in now - in my opinion.
If you are looking to trade bitcoin, then I can’t help you and if you are asking for help on here to day trade, I’d suggest you rethink how to spend your money ;)
The other guy is suggesting that people will buy bitcoin so when (if) it forks (splits in two) people will sell the coins they are entitled to in the new branch of the chain and spend it investing in alt coins - so there may be fresh money going into alt coins thus raising the price - speculation, but possible.

You will have $200 worth of bitcoin (BTC) and $200 of the Segwit2x coin (which will trade as BTX).
You won’t be able to trade for (c24) hours before the split and it’s advisable to not transact for a short while after.
Once the dust settles you can sell your BTX or BTC coins and re-invest them.
But it’s likely that the forked coin (BTX) won’t be worth as much as bitcoin BTC; between 10-40% I would guess.
After a few days, whichever is the most popular coin from the fork will hold the name BTC.
Class the fork as a dividend payment; sell the B2X and reinvest back in to BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:30:48
For $25 just leave it on the exchange as the fees associated with moving it are too much relative to the size of your purchase.

Completely disagree ;) a rising tide has failed spectacularly to raise all boats, in fact it has only served to sink plenty. I too am ‘rich’ (retired at 35 with multiple properties, no debts, no money worries), but I see the system and appreciate that I help others through a social warfare programme. You know people invent things and get rich in Europe too; and are financially incentivised to do so; but they also pay in to a system that supports the poorest. If you live in one of the richest countries in the world and can’t ‘afford’ to give all citizens access to free healthcare and time off to spend with their newborn kids, then it’s a shit system (IMO). Just because you did it, you feel that others can as well; well, some can, sure, but what about those who cant and not because they are lazy or stupid, but because they don’t have the support, or opportunity and more importantly, because not everyone can - we don’t live in a utopia just yet. 
The lack of empathy for fellow man, women and children just because you (collectively) feel apathy towards them is horrendous. People die because of no healthcare - in this day that is disgusting. It’s not perfect in Europe but a damn site better than over the water.
Socialism over capitalism any day ;)

If you haven’t spent your bitcoin and it’s been sat in a wallet for which you own the keys, then when bitcoin has split in the past (I.e to bitcoin cash), then your private key will also unlock some bitcoin cash for you (as you will hold the same number of bitcoin cash as the number of bitcoin you had - when the chain splits, you get a copy on each chain). So you can sell the Bitcoin Cash and buy more Bitcoin! Or send it to me ;)

Your 0.092BTC was bundled together with a translation that also went to another address for the remainder. Likely because you sent it from an exchange to your own wallet and the exchange sent two payments at the same time. Happens all the time.

Ok ...
You can buy €500 BTC on Coinbase;
It’s most likely fine to leave it on Coinbase, but to have actual control of your BTC,  you need to send it to your own wallet ( electrum wallet for example - google search btc wallets)
No one knows what will happen, but history suggests BTC will continue to go up so buying now is as good a plan as any
If the fork happens, You get the same amount of the forked coin as you had BTC, although the forked coin will most likely be worth a lot less. If you don’t buy before the fork, you won’t get a free forked version of your investment.

You don’t care that the rich get rich, that’s fine, but the fact you don’t care that the poor get poorer, that’s the issue and it’s why the American Capitalist system isn’t something I’d like to happen in Europe. The capitalist society is fine so long as you have money, when you don’t it’s worse than many of the 3rd world countries. The American Dream has people fooled in to thinking that you are only poor temporarily and that with ‘hard work’ you’ll make it. Some will, but the percentages are so small, your better off trying to change the system so it works for the many, not for the few.
