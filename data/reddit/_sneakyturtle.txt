We just got the info that they sold. We are assuming the rest will go back to mark and we are assuming that it the Bitcoins will be on hold.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:06:59
fake wall pulled again 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:35:20
we are dippening again
@_date: 2018-03-19 09:54:47
considering the past few days a good night sleep is something we should appreciate. They are going to wake up in a good mood
and since the whole trump thing we don't invite Americans anymore :P
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:26:09
we are going to see 10k before we see 11k 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:47:50
The bitcoin life 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:05:24
are you still hodling ?
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:32:21
brave souls whoever is buying now 
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:46:11
there lots of trashy ICOs it had to happen 
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:50:31
this drop feels a bit different 
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:51:04
they can get cheaper coins soon :P
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:42:27
we are going to get pumped to heaven 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:16:57
there were a lot of warnings though 
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:56:56
you can sell now and buy more later then 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:22:25
i have a feeling 8k wont hold this time 
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:59:16
the pump seems like it has no legs. now, the people who bought into this will sell more.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:36:20
of all the times to buy bitcoin why buy now ?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:48:21
guys be careful buying into this dip might fall too fast 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:50:54
so you just bought at 10.8k? stop it i need it to go down :P
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:55:01
bulls weren't able to break 8.6 just a day ago, this is going no where 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:30:08
looks like we are dropping again, another pump that got no where.
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:28:06
yeah i know nothing that's why i got it right 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:34:13
If we bounce off the 6k and break the bear trend then its most likely we will never see 6k again. If it drops and doesn't hold then we continue searching for the true bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:42:45
looks like we are about to drop again 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:58:20
omg look at all of those red numbers, so sexy.
sorry guys i need to take care of the little bear inside me  
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:44:15
Sure, we all make profit and loses and understand the trading game. Though, we don't have to be dicks to others who may not be as fortunate. They may still be interested in Bitcoin as whole, why drive them away with trolling.    
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:14:50
here we go 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:39:31

@_date: 2018-03-18 21:57:52
guys prepare the 10k memes :P
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:35:18
we are going to wake up the HODLERS soon 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:02:41

@_date: 2018-03-14 18:03:10
you guys ready for round 3 ?
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:12:54
we are going to trigger so many alarms 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:21:18
this drop is going to be epic 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:07:25

@_date: 2018-03-18 22:48:10

@_date: 2018-03-08 02:54:13
everyone is playing hot bitato
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:33:42
time to dump it 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:02:29
every min we get someone calling bot on a random number that gets broken 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:34:15
Don't give advice if you are not following it 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:13:37
how old are you ?
Bitcoin went from 19k &gt; 6k &gt; 11.9k&gt; 7.5k. A lot of the Bitcoin Community are hurting, some lost a lot of money. These are some of the same people you need to go to the moon, be a little sympathetic.
It also worsened by the HODL mentality in a bear market and shit advice's that goes on here. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:49:46
time to trigger the alarms 
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:38:12
how long do you think it will take for people that bought right now to realize it was a bad idea? 15 min or 30 min 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:24:26
lol looks like i am right after all 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:07:21
you are nuts, you think it will stabilize going into the weekend 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:15:44
when people start selling on the wall it gets pulled 
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:49:18
you missed the meeting we all agreed no dip today :P
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:38:10
NO, NO, NO!!!
people just got burned like 7 times in the last 24hours
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:50:54
people like you are the reason we can't drop in peace :P
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:20:43
I don't think we are done dropping yet.
We will probably see 8.5k some time later but not now 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:42:55
most hodlers are below 9k, they are still not feeling this
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:26:10
never mind pussy whales bailed 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:50:14

@_date: 2018-03-09 04:29:07

@_date: 2018-03-07 09:56:52
someone dropped 600 coins at once taking the price from 10.54k to 10.40k
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:41:56
Did you guys see that ?
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:41:51
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:38:24
Did you have to bold your message cause you knew what you are saying has no substance 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:06:43
what support?
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:28:09

@_date: 2018-03-07 08:09:14
bull bois so eager 
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:09:26
Mt.Gox is still fucking us over though 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:27:04
what do you mean little volume ?
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:39:23
the calm before the storm 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:17:16
just drop it now 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:11:03
There is no moon, we haven't been able to break 12k for a while now.
You are ok with the fact that you buy and price instantly drops where is the logic in that.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:44:11
when you are a redditor for 1 month
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:20:17
READY TO LAUNCH IN 10..
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:17:00

@_date: 2018-03-09 10:05:43
slaughter of the bulls :P
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:44:51
most of the support was at 8300 and it broke through but we will see 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:30:44
there is lots of volume in bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:09:05
time to dumb it
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:38:20
we haven't hit 11k still 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:10:51
we are going to penetrate the moon 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:22:07
its goes up and down 100%
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:45:33
so angry, let me guess you just bought 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:49:32
There are a lot of reasons 
1- We are in a bear market for while now, meaning no new money coming in to sustain the price or increase it. A lot of people will stay out of this until things improves. Bitcoin drops as hard as it goes up, don't bet against the trend
2- We need to retest the 6k to make sure its a true bottom
3- No one knows what the hell is going with Mt. Gox bitcoins
4- Sentiment toward bitcoin price is mixed between bitcoiners
5- There are still issues with the stock especially with USA tariffs and the effect on that is global
