More on the little considered fact about miners mining a large block to slow down others:
to gain something they must mine Block(A) and Block(A+1)
currently, the largest miner pool have 20% of the hashing power. This imply the chance to get two blocks in a row are 1/25 if the pool is mining fairly. Or the chance to get a second block are 1/5 when you get one.
Now, if the pool build a huge block delaying the other miners two minutes, it would increase its revenues just a tiny bit, because the chance to find a new block in two minutes, when the mean time is (for him mining alone on the next block) 50 minutes.
If the pool have less hashrate, say 10%, the advantage would be 2 minutes over 100 minutes (the mean to find a block for this pool).
I'm not a statistician, but color me unimpressed by the possibility of gaming the system with larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:04:09
There will be sufficient fees, because miners have no incentive to include any transaction for free.
Today they can do it because they get the new coins.
Tomorrow they will get less coins or no coins, only fees.
If a miner just mine the transactions with a decent fee, the others will mine the transaction without fees. Maybe, or maybe not.
The competition will keep the fees at the minimum economically sound level. If the fees are not enough, the miners will not mine them (smaller blocks) or will exit the field. If they are high enough, miners will mine them and add them to the next block available.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:10:38
What is interesting is , not only the price is stable, but the volume (in USD) of transaction is nearly flat (slight increasing) in the last two months.
More it is stable, more it is usable for small purchases and common daily uses and not for quick transfers (to avoid volatility).
This will cause an increase in the demand to hold Bitcoin. Maybe not for long periods of time or for large quantities, but will increase adoption and transactions.
If the experience go well, people will increasingly use it and hold it.
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:55:07
If Bitcoin blocksize do not increase with unanimity, it will increase by majority.
As the blocksize limit approach, delay will be even more frequent, and the network will become even increasingly inefficient or unusable.
Then the community will divide. Someone will force an increase of the blocksize and someone will staunchly refuse.
Two nodes will be deployed (call them XT and Core, if you want).
The payment processors will go for the XT with a 20x increase in capacity, and with them all the shops online and offline. The users will go with them, also.
The Core blockchain will only be able to process 1 MB of transaction every ten minutes where the XT transaction will be able to process 20 MB of transactions.
All the transactions in the Core will be in the XT but not all transactions in the XT will be in the Core.
If you are a payment processor or a vendor where would you like to be? In the blockchain where your payment show up or in one where they would not show up or maybe could show up if you are lucky.
Miners could disagree, but if payment processors do not take their coins, nor major exchanges, they are out of luck. Just as simple.
Users would prefer a chain where fees are low (for the same hash rate and security) or one where fees are high?
One where their payments show up or where their payments could show up or just do not show up.

I, for sure, don't want to be on the chain these douchebags are and have the majority of hashing power.
If they resort to these tricks, what else they would do?
On the other side, if they trick the XT miners to start the fork, they could trick miners and merchants and users to switch to the new branch. It could easily backfire even if they are successful.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:41:47
I agree with the scenario depicted by Theymos but Gavin have a major point noting the fork would happen only if the 3/4 of the hashing power agree and this would greatly reduce the severity of the scenario depicted by Theymos.
The only thing not described in Theymos scenario is a simple fact:
the xt-chain would contain all the transaction regarding pre-fork bitcoins. But the nxt-chain (no-xt-chain) would not, because of the blocksize limit. This would imply some pre-fork bitcoin transactions would only show up in the xt-chain. Then people with pre-fork bitcoin would prefer to move to the xt-chain because their transactions would need a smaller fee and would have a chance to actually be recorded int he blockchain.
Given the market of fees, the nxt would require larger fees (a lot larger to be included in any block) and the xt would require smaller fees (just to prevent spamming attack or be included in the next block).
If the market give a different value to pre-fork bitcoins and post fork bitcoins in the xt and nxt chains, the cost of the fee in both chain must be included in the evaluation, not just if the bitcoin was mined before or after the fork and in what chain.

The simple fact is people would leave Bitcoin if their transactions start to drop out of the mempool without being confirmed even if they had paid a proper fee.
Would you like to be forced to pay 1$ per transaction to have the transaction processed

The difference start to happen when there are more transactions than the smaller block chain can store.
the fees on the larger will be smaller, and the transaction will be processed in time. 
The other will have larger fees and the transactions will be processed slowly and not all of them will be.
Guess what side will win in the (not so) long run?

If block A and block B come out at enough different times, there is no problem with their relative size: by the time A is out, B is already distributed to the majority of the network. Or the reverse, by the time B is out A is already distributed to the majority of the network.
If they are both found in a short time period, there is a race to get to the majority of the network (mainly the other miners, because they MUST mine over it to prevent it from becoming orphan).
If the blocks are roughly of the same size (if both miners are fair) the chance to get the block depend the relative hashing power and the upload capacity.
As the probability to find a block every second is roughly stable, because of the retargeting of the difficulty, what matter is the time to propagate a block thru the network.
So the malicious miner mining a Very Large Block must compensate the advantage to mine the next block before the others are able to download and verify the current block with the disadvantage to increase the chances to lose the block reward (and have wasted his hashing power on the current and next block).
Someone better than me with statistics and spreadsheets could draw a few charts comparing diffusion times on the network and statistical variability on the time one miner could find two consecutive blocks.

You should evaluate the possible return/time of Bitcoin with the possible return of using your spare cash in other ways. Choose the stuff with the fastest return first, then move to the next.
For example:
with 3 months of savings (17.83€) you could buy a bread maker and make bread for yourself and your family. Usually this  could lower your daily expenses a lot and pay itself back pretty fast (a few weeks at most).
For example, the same (fresh) bread people pay 6 €/kg at the shop could be made with 2.5 € at home. This is, at least 3 € less (and it is tastier and healthier).
If you buy 1 KG of bread every day (for the family) you save at least 3 € a day (in a months you save enough to pay the machine, in 20 days you save enough to pay it back, after it is 3 € more money in your pocket.
The marginal cost is 5 minutes to prepare the ingredients and start the machine and clean it at the end and buying them at the grocery store.
The risk associated with a choice or another is pretty different: with bitcoin there is a risk where the bread machine give a pretty return in a short time.
The saving from the bread machine give you a small cash flow increasing the rate of savings and you move to something else making you even more money (saving money you already spend or making money in new ways).

In this way a small minority would not be able to hold the network forever, just slow it down a bit
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:29:46
Higher the share of hashing power required before the fork, higher the veto power of a smaller minority of hold-out.
If 3/4 of the hashing power agree to larger blocks, after a grace period (2 weeks, one months, whatever) the fork should start. The hold out can continue to hold out as much as they want; they will just hold out alone. If they do not agree with the majority, they are free to do what they prefer as the majority is.

The fear is irrational.
Mining larger blocks (and this is very large blocks) do not help to win the next block if you have not, already a huge share of the hashing power of the entire network.
Currently a block is distributed to more than 50% of the network in around 6 seconds. The mean blocksize is 400KB.
If people have at least a 20Mbps connection they can download a 20 MB block in around 8 seconds. Make ten.
The probability to find a block every second is 0,00000013969838619232177734375. Make one on a million every ten seconds.
So, if even it took 20x of the current time to distribute a new block to half of the network, the chance to find a block increase just of 1/50K. Not worth the time and the hassle and the risk a competing smaller block take the reward because it spread faster.
If even the miners stopped to hash to download and verify a huge block (say 200 MB) when the mean block is 20 MB (a very dumb action), this would stop them them for 2400 seconds (40 minutes). Now, how much hashing power should have the miner to take advantage of this? At least 25% of the network hashing power to have 50% of chances to get the new block.
This would, also, massively reduce the hashing power of the network and of difficulty. At the next retargeting, all miners would find a block 4 time faster.
BUT if just a miner decided to not stop hashing when the new block was announced but not verified, he would be able to distribute a smaller block exponentially faster. Full nodes would just start to download the alternative block in parallel. But if one is 20 MB and the other 200 MB what would end first? What would be validated first and added to the node's blockchain first?
The smaller one, because the total PoW of its chain is greater than the total PoW of the larger/slower.

1) the increase of value will be a lot slower than now because there will be no value left to import in the bitcoin economy. 
2) the reduction of supply will be very small (0.1% every year, probably a lot less)
3) The value will increase with the growth of the economy (production output). More production chasing the same amount of BTC imply diminishing prices for all.
4) The interest rate will be determined by the saving available to create new loans and the demand of loans. The price of these loans is their interest rate.
5) If people have more savings than they feel they need and no good way to spend them, they will be loaned out lowering the interest rate.
6)If people have not enough savings than they will save and the interest rate will increase.

Unfortunately the data for M1 is weekly and not daily like the data for Bitcoin from Blockchain.info.
Before my belief was the actual inflation of M1 would surpass the actual inflation of BTC around the time of the next halving (June 2016) or next year, if the inflation of the USD M1 increased.
Surprise, surprise, Janet Yellen pants are on fire.
M1 is increasing as fast, north of 10% yoy i n the last few months.
The trend inflation of BTC (the weekly value of inflation projected over 52 weeks) is already under the inflation of M1 of the past 52 weeks.
The inflation of the past 52 weeks for Bitcoin is just 1.52% higher than the inflation of the past 52 weeks of M1 (July 16 2014) and the trend is descending.
Conservatively, it went
from 7.9%  30-12-2013

If the cost to mine rise too much, some miners will fold leaving more coins to others.
The hash rate will stabilize (not being profitable to increase it) and less coin will be mined - the standard is 3600/day but now they are more
If enough fold and the hash rate fall, there will be less coin mined for a longer time, because the difficulty adjustment will happen not in 12 days like now or in 14.5 days like default, but in 15-16 days. If the hash rate halved the difficulty adjustment would happen after 29 days.

If you look at the data in the first tab of the spreadsheet (taken directly from the Federal Reserve of Saint Luis website) and you compute them (already done in the spreadsheet), you can see the Money Base (MB) inflation of the previous 52 weeks was 40% just in december 2013 and now it is 20%.
So there was 40% more dollar printed out of thin air at the end of 2013 than existed at the start. Now, compared to the last summer, there are just 20% more.
If you look at the charts from the website I linked as source of the data, you can see from september 2008 until now, the MB quadrupled with a compound inflation rate around 19% per year.
At this rate 1 M$ will be worth today's 10.000$ in 25 years and few weeks.
The M1 money is not growing as fast, but it is in the ball park of 8% per year as a mean of the last 6 years.
What is important to understand is the inflation differential is understood by savvy financial investors (people understanding the difference between nominal and real wealth). So, as the cost of switching from USD to BTC start lowering compared to the cost of keeping assets denominated in USD, they will switch to BTC.
This move will lower the value of the USD and raise the value of the BTC. This will start the hyper-bitcoinization and the hyperinflation of the USD.

The exchange rate of bitcoin is linked (directly or indirectly) to its inflation compared to fiat money inflation (USD, €, etc.).
Currently (a few weeks ago) I computed a spreadsheet (Google Docs) and   at Jan 2014 the USD inflated 5.x% yoy and BTC inflated 10.x% yoy (the previous year).
BTC went to the Moon in 2013 after (nov 2012) its inflation moved from 25% yoy (see Argentina for similar rates of inflations) to 12.5% yoy because of the halving (see US during QE). In fact, some months data show the USD inflated more than BTC.
The next two halving are very important because:
1) The next will put, permanently, BTC inflation rate under the level of (virtually) all fiat currencies. Even the best it is improbable to inflate less than 5% yoy. The USD will inflate a lot more (the data I crunched, the data the Fed show, I bet is misleading).
2) The next after it (end 2019 start 2020) will put BTC inflation rate (around 2.25%) under the global economy growth rate (around 3%).

VISA have 212,603,000 transactions per day.
If Bitcoin had the same numbers the miners would get paid $2.1M per day, with a $ .01 fee roughly as much they were paid with Bitcoin exchange rate at 600$ with a block reward of 25 BTC.
If the fee was $0.1 per transaction (ten cents) they would get there with just 1/10th of the transactions.
If we factor in all the new transactions allowed by Bitcoin protocol but not possible with legacy financial services, it is not impossible to get there in few years.
So, now, Bitcoin costs per transaction are very large (if we account the block reward): they are around 20$ per transaction. If Bitcoin reach real mass adoption, the costs will be splitted over a hugely larger number of transactions making them very cheap compared with VISA, bank, etc. transactions.

If HSBC had lost its license in the US, it could have unforeseeable consequences on the US (global) banking system (like causing a market crash, causing panic sell, etc.).

All the cash moving from the US to mexico (and beyond) need to be laundered by some bank (because it is too much) so it can be returned to the US to be used in the economy. When the flux was stopped (temporarily) there was a liquidity crisis in the US).

The point is the relative inflation of the USD (and other fiat currencies) compared to BTC inflation  (the coins mined relative to the supply available).
If BTC inflate at 4.5%-5% per year and the USD inflate at 10% (M1) or 20% (MB), there will be a relative, long term, increase in value of BTC compared tot he USD. If I must choose in what form keep my savings I will choose something inflating less and keeping its value. Be it BTC, gold, silver, shares or land.
More people using BTC to pay and be paid imply more people having a cash balance in BTC instead of USD (or €, Argentina's Pesos, Rubles Yen, Yuan, or whatever).
If I pay 1/10th of my bills using BTC, I will need to keep one tenth of my daily cash in BTC, just as if I need to pay 1/10th of my bills in €, I will need to buy as much € as to pay them. If the need is constant, people will start to keep enough BTC (or €) around to avoid last minute problem when converting USD in BTC. Knowing the exchange rate will raise in favor of BTC, people will prefer to acquire BTC earlier (at a lower price) than later (at an higher price) and will try to keep their balance in fiat lower (because they will lose in value) and will convert BTC in USd or € as later as they can do.
If BTC inflate 5% less than USD, BTC exchange rate is 1000 USD, I could hold one BTC for one year or some T-Bond promising me to pay me 1050 USD in a year. But actually I will ask a lot more, because holding a T-Bond expose me to a number of counterparty risks (inflation greater than expected, not performance of the  debtor, taxes, costs in early liquidation, currency controls, etc.).
At this moment, the inflation of BTC is higher than the inflation of the USD (and a few of other currencies). This is compensated by the new adopters buying BTC. But it is not possible/rewarding for big money to enter now, because they would lose value (in favor of miners) and later entrants entering later, when the price fall back. 
They need to enter when the price level and the market cap is large enough to be able to absorb them.
Depending on the future, if the inflation differential turn positive for BTC price will start to raise again. Larger the difference, faster it will raise.

I like IkmoIkmo replies to OP.
In fact, I believe, BTC inflation effect is widely underestimate in the context of exchange rate with USD and other fiat currencies.
I have this chart comparing USD Money Base and M1 with the supply of BTC
The data is taken from blockchain.info and the St. Luis Federal Reserve website.
If you look at the first chart starting from January 2011 you can see the annual BTC inflation rate drop from 200% to 100% in just six months, where the new bitcoin mined every day (7200 BTC) were worth between $7200 (at $1/BTC exchange rate) to $230K at the peak of $32.
It was an unsustainable level ($32) at the time as the network was tiny, inflation huge and the utility of the network very small (they just started using it for gambling in 2011 with SatoshiDice). There was no way in 2011 +$200K would pour in the bitcoin economy every day. 75% of the worth of every $ converted in 2011 would be redistributed to the miners eventually (if we suppose no BTC was and ever will be lost - is some got lost the share redistributed would be larger). Today, December 2014, just 2/3 of all bitcoin are mined, so just 1/3rd of the worth of every $ converted in BTC will be redistributed to the miners. It is worth noting the largest part of this redistribution happen earlier and the smaller part happen later because inflation is continuously falling. So there is a reason for large/giant/huge/gargantuan firms to wait to enter start converting in bitcoin. Larger they are later they must convert to bitcoin their holdings to reduce the purchasing power redistribution at their expenses.
The redistribution of purchasing power to the miners is a cost for new entrants converting goods, services and fiat in BTCs. This cost is mainly upfront in the first months or years. This cost must be covered by the advantages provided by using BTC as a payment system. This is because the first serious use cases for BTC use were unlawful or borderline unlawful (gambling and drug purchases). The savings provided by using BTC as a payment system were larger than the costs incurred. E.G. the total costs of dealing in person with a drug seller are higher than the total costs of dealing with him online in a dark market.
There is a wealth transfer between new entrants and old entrants and miners. Lower is the inflation, lower is the transfer to miners and higher the transfer to old entrants. In an high inflationary environment large entities need to and profit from staying invested and not holding cash. They could profit also from taking loans at lower interest rates than less wealthy entities like individuals and investing them. As inflation go down, larger firms and wealthy individuals start to have a greater interest in converting some of their wealth in BTC hold in their balance sheets.
In this regard, if you look back at the charts I linked, you can see 2012 and 2014 were years when the Federal Reserve have no QE. And they were "quiet" years for BTC (in 2012 it just went up 5x). When the two main bubble happened (2011 and 2013) the tops happened at the apex of the QE madness. It is not surprise to me USD BM went up 40% from the previous year (December 2013 compared to December 2012) and in the same year BTC went 100x with an inflation falling from 25% to 12.5% year and then 10%. What happened this year is QE ended and the inflation rate was greater for BTC than for the USD (sometime a whopping 5% difference).
From an economical POW it was absurd for a large firm to accumulate large position in BTCs if it could stay in USD or in some limited commodity, because a 5% gap in this environment is very difficult to fill. Actors buying heavily in BTCs (like Tim Draper) did it because they needed BTC for some related business (payment remittances, etc.) not as a way to keep their purchasing power safe.
Things are slowly turning here, because the Federal Reserve QE is ended and the Money Base is at the same level of one year ago. Zero inflation rate in Money Base. I suppose they are digesting the indigestion of the last year. But I do not see the Federal Reserve increase interest rates and draining liquidity in any significative way. This imply, in my opinion, it can not go worse than this. We are improbable to go down further, probably not under 300 for extended time. As the network become larger demand for BTC continue to grow (in value) and not for speculation only but for actual use as a payment network.
2015 will probably see a "slow" increase in prices, like 2012, returning to ATH without much drama (in BTC terms obviously), if the Federal Reserve keep interest rates to zero but do not engage in another round of QE (I know, it is impossible to keep them at zero and do not CTRL-P like crazy). If the Federal Reserve start another round of QE like the last then you will see a lot more migration to BTC from larger firms and wealthy individuals and the price could go really up in the 10K range.

1) To sell his coins, Satoshi need to move them to one or more exchange
2) This will be noticed by the professionals of the market as an HUGE number of bitcoin/day destroyed. 
Current max BTC*Day destroyed was 130 M. 
All Satoshi's stash would be in the 1 Billion BTC*day destroyed. Hardly would not be noticed.
3) A lot of smart money would move to the exchanges to buy any deep (there are endless $ or € and Yen, but limited BTCs)
4) The price would fall a lot, probably in the 100$ range for some time (hours? Days?) then recover slowly first and faster after.
In the end, it would not change the fundamentals.
Satoshi's stash would be redistributed to the buyers, so every single actors, after the sell off, would end with a smaller stash than Satoshi's and would be unable to affect the market in the same way. Also, the new buyers would get a loss if they dumped their coins in the same manner, so they would not do so.

The question is absurd, in my mind, because you can not have bitcoin existing for another six years (past the next halving) and keeping its exchange rate, unless the Federal Reserve start to inflate exactly like bitcoin and a few other conditions.
More time Bitcoin continue to exist, larger is its value, because it show it is able to last. More stable it is the purchasing power of the unit of account, more confidence there is in the currency and users will be more confident in holding a balance in BTCs.
So, more stable it is, more lasting it is, more valuable it become, so the pressure for the exchange rate to raise will just increase because more people will be willing and confident to keep part or all of their money/savings in BTCs.

Merchants adoption is fundamental to obtain larger adoption from users. Apart from enthusiasts, geeks and technophiles the majority of people do not move their fat asses until they have a very good and compelling reason or many good reasons.
Merchants are users too. If they accept (first) and then start use (later) bitcoin, they will start to keep part of their balances in bitcoin to pay other merchants (suppliers) and/or their employees.
The best solution would be for merchants to pay their employees and suppliers with bitcoin every time they are able to do so and the other party is willing to accept them.
This would increase adoption AND the merchant base and sequester even more bitcoin inside closed economic circuits.

You got it wrong, the ability to use BTC as a mean of indirect exchange depend on the will of people to hold them under certain price level ("price to hold") and buy more of them if the price go down enough.
If people do not assigned them a value, they would not be useful to transport value. No one would accept them in exchange of goods and services.
The only limit of bitcoin is there MUST be enough transactions on the network to pay for the miners to secure the network itself with their hashing power. Now, it is paid by inflation (block reward), tomorrow must be paid by fees. This is because the number of transactions much grow a lot.

They can force people to deliver but they can not force people to maximize productivity.
If they started with the same population and size and natural resources and military, the capitalists would have a higher long term economic growth and, in ten or twenty years, the economy of the capitalists would be much larger than the economy of the communists.
If the communists waged war against the capitalists, the capitalists would need to redirect a smaller % of their economy to the war to stall them. As total war is escalation until one side collapse and the other win, the communist economy would collapse first than the capitalist one.
The only chance to win for the communists is a sudden invasion and stealthy infiltration, taking the enemy with its pants down. The war end few days/weeks after it started. If not, they are toasted.

Does Lansky become the target of Russia arrest &amp; extraditions requests if he put a feet outside NY or the US? He is the originator of the regulations so it could be considered guilty.
And, buy the way, a lot of people will want use Bitcoin anyway and, forcing the good people to not use them, the regulations just help the not so law abiding people.

When you remove risks (even the risk to dying from starvation and living in the streets) you remove incentives for people to behave in a civil manner.
If I will have a house, no matter what I do, why I must have a job? Why I must keep the house in order, clean and don't trash it?
Why I must have a job, if I will receive food enough to live?
If I have a house and food from the government, why must I have a job and pay taxes when I could hang around with friends? If I'm a low skilled, low IQ individual, I have little possibility to have a good job. And a legal low paying job would cost me more (losing benefits) than I could gain from it.
But, if I risk starvation and losing my living place, I will work hard to keep it and continue to eat every day. And have no time to commit petty crimes.

I agree with your opinion.
If a miners is creating a big block on purpose:
1) he must keep the SPAM transactions with zero or near zero fees. These will not be included in bigger blocks by other miners because of the risk of being orphaned
2) He keep the transaction for himself. He do not propagate them and the transaction pay zero fees. He must propagate all blocks and data by himself initially. 
With the Reverse Bloom Filters and other optimizations of the network, the latter would put the evil miner at a big disadvantage, because he would need a lot more time do distribute his block, because no one would have the data to check the block immediately.
Gavin told a block of 20 MB need around 20 seconds to confirm after being downloaded. This is 20 second on a 600 second interval. Not very much given the variability of the block time.
But a block of 100 M would need 100 seconds to confirm, now a serious part of the mean time to find a block.
3) If the attacker just pay the fees for his transactions, he is not really attacking the network, he is subsidizing it with fees. A 100 MB block would pay around 15% of the reward of the block today. After 2016 it would pay 30% of the block reward and after 2020 it would pay it would pay as much as the reward of the block.
The current (real) cost of a transaction is between $ 5 and 10. With a 100 MB block, the cost would fall around 10-5 cents.
A 20 MB block put bitcoin in the same league of PayPal.
A 100 MB block put bitcoin in breathing distance from VISA. And would make the network able to pay the miners without the need of a block reward

With 1 Mbps you can handle and download a 1 MB block every ten minutes (it just need 10 seconds to do so).
With 20 Mbps you can handle 20 MB blocks. With 1 Mbps you would have to dedicate 1/3 of your bandwidth to download a full block (but they will not be immediately full after the upgrade).
How many people have 20 Mbps connections?
How many business could join the Bitcoin Network and transact in bitcoins if we increase the number of transactions possible 20x?
A lot, and a lot of them would host a full node just to be able to verify on the fly the transactions they receive (unconfirmed and confirmed).
A decentralized network do not be to be completely flat and with all nodes able to take the same loads.
Should we reduce the blocksize to accommodate the 56K bps folks connecting with modems?
If there are enough independent nodes in the network, the network is decentralized and P2P.
What is enough?
Is 10K enough?
Is 6K enough?
If the nodes are distributed in China, US, Iran, Italy, Russia, are they decentralized enough?
Do you think they will collude?
With pruning you have the data (the Merkle Tree) to check the data you request and an archival node serve you. It is around 10KB per block or something (whatever be the block size).
Do you want more full node with the full blockchain, fully auditable?
Just make an upgrade to the protocol allowing archival nodes to get paid for data served (like Satoshi imagined, IIRC). You will see nodes popping up like fungi after the rain.

If we suppose something is useful for some subpopulation, we could suppose they will become unshakable after they have experienced it. Or, at least, if they are shakable, they will move from converted and unconverted and back; in a population this could imply there will be some % of individual always in a convert state even if the single individual could change their state at random.

The timing is not casual.
End 2016 is 6 months after the next halving, when bitcoins inflation fall from 9% to 4.5% (default) or, at worst, 10% to 5% (increasing in hashing rate rarely is more than 20% between retargetings and usually lower).
This will bring internal inflation of Bitcoin well under the inflation of every single fiat currency in existence today (USD 12%, € something less than USD, Yen (to da moon), etc.

Given the increasing number of payment processors integrating Bitcoin in their services, I think Gavin is right to fear big problems (not enough space to accommodate all transactions)  earlier than later.
If we will redo the increase in transaction of last year (50% more from august to january - less than 6 months) we will get a mean block size of 600 KB at least by or 750 KB.
This imply an hour delay in finding a block cause a delay of another hour in clearing the backlog (with 600K).
If it go to 750 KB, the backlog would need 2 hours to clear
At 800 K it would need  3 hours and ten minutes to clear
At 900 K it would need 6 hours and 20 minutes to clear.
If we get to 750 KB before January, we will be in the 900 KB by March April 2016.

It could not need to maintain the attack continuously.
Just jack up a spike of transactions flooding the mempools of full nodes so they run out of RAM and are forced to drop transactions or crash.
Or jack up a flood of transactions with low-medium fees compared with normal transactions, then wait until the network start clearing up. This would force people to raise their transaction fees (time is money) to get priority and the spam would not be cleared for a long time. Then push out another batch of spam transactions.
The advantage would be to force people to pay larger fees without essentially paying any fees because the spam transactions are kept in the mempool a lot longer and then dropped or slowly processed.

It benefit you because it benefit the business accepting them and they are or will be willing to give you serious discount if you pay using bitcoin.
1) bitcoin transaction are irreversible, unlike CC. The business accepting BTC do not need to worry about reversed payments and do not need to store a lot of sensible data. This save it a lot of money it could give back to the customers in form of discounts.
2) the bitcoins I accept now can be spent in just one hours (you know irreversible). You can not spend the $ you get from accepting CC immediately. You must await the day they land on your bank account and this need a fair number of days or weeks. If I drive a car for Uber, I could reroute immediately the BTCs I'm paid with to the fuel station's card or to pay my rent, bills, etc. automatically. And they can do the same to their supplies as well. Even on Sundays and Christmas.
3) The exchange rate fluctuations happen because there is too much short term speculation and not enough real use as a payment system. Any increase of the use as a payment system decrease fluctuations and make it more useable
4) Even if you have not bitcoin, but your brother have, they could be able to pay your fare with Uber from everywhere in the world. Try this with a credit card or cash.

Probably not, because the business do not need to buy the bitcoins into the market but would accumulate them during the previous week.
The main idea it is not to buy bitcoins to pay wages but to sell goods and services and pay wages with them.
Overstock.com, for example, got $ 3M worth of bitcoins in 2014 and have 1500 employees. This is around $ 2k per employees worth of bitcoins per employee. The average wage there is $ 61k. If they all took the same share of bitcoin, it would be around 3.3% of their annual paycheck.
Not an huge sum (but not small either), but Overstock would not sell any bitcoin on the market and would not pay any fee for this. We would have 1500 more users of bitcoins, mainly concentrate in a small geographic area and pushing over the local businesses to be able to shop with them.

It is my opinion that the community could just fork anyway, even with a minority of the hash rate.
It would need some hacking of the difficulty and some coding to prevent a 51% attack.
But someone would get tired to wait and would launch a really contentious HF as a nuclear option.
It just need an exchange supporting the HF and telling the miners not joining the HF (or attacking it) to keep their newly minted coins until the HF is resolved.

People usually do not think about the pros of having a large cap on the block size. How many more business, mainly large ones, could join the network?
If many more large business join the network, would they have an incentive to run a full node, well connected with many peers and with ultra high speed?
If the Bitcoin network had 5.000 transactions per seconds and blocks about 1 GB every ten minutes, how many people and business would rely on it? A lot.
5.000 transactions per second would be in the ballpark of VISA mean transaction rate.
Broadcasting the blockchain would become a public service useful even for large/medium business.
Here come the Jeff Garzik idea of Bitcoin Satellites broadcasting transactions and new blocks.
No one would mess with the network, because the miners would make 1.5 billions in revenues only in fees (1 cent per transaction) every year. And if you consider 1 cent is way less than what VISA demand for a transaction, you can understand there would be a lot more transactions).

The medium time between blocks is 10 minutes.
So, the medium waiting time before a transaction show in the blockchain is 5 minutes.
If the shop decide to not wait for the transaction to show up in the blockchain, it could do so a little risk, if the value of the transaction is small.
1) the transaction will immediately show invalid if there is no coin at the addres(es) of the payer
2) after 30 seconds, the transaction is diffused to more than 90% of the network.
3) to prevent the legit transaction to be included in the blockchain, another (competing for the same funds) transaction must already be broadcasted in the network.
4) So, if no conflicting transaction show up in the first 30 seconds (even less), there is little chance another transaction can prevent the inclusion of the first (legit) transaction.

This is equivalent to shitting on the heads of miners (all of them, not just the chinese).
I'm not surprised miners are now starting to be pissed off by Core Developers shitting on their heads because miners don't behave like nice trained dogs to their Core masters.

The funny part is the BTU branch can survive a minority hard fork where BC branch cannot.
It can have less blocks because it can increase their size as much as it is needed.
If BTU has a block every 40 minutes, it can be 4 MB or 16 MB or 128 MB (the last would compensate the bad luck of miners and there is no block for 200 minutes).
And the miners mining in a minority (25% or less)  branch would make a ton of fees in this scenario (four times the fees compared to the other side just replaying the transaction in the other branch). Add the fees from the transactions with cheaper fee that would never confirm in the other branch.
They just need enough demand for their coins

There is a reason Satoshi invented Bitcoin  and we are using it and not Adam Back's hash cash.
The validity of a block depend on the presence of:
1) valid PoW
2) No invalid transactions
These are the only rules shared by every real Bitcoin node.
Refusing valid blocks is an option of individual nodes:
1) because they have the wrong size 
2) because they include a transaction the node don't like (transactions larger than 1 MB for example
3) because you use Parallel Validation (now in Unlimited). You receive a large block and receive a small block later; and the small block  confirm before the big block confirm.
4) whatever.
Rules like these are left to the discretion of node operators and their personal preferences.
Economic incentive dictates they try to stick to the same set of rules as much as possible.

My question tu Slush is this (if you know the answer please link to it):
1) Slush will signal for SegWit with all its blocks?
2) Only with the blocks found by miners not voting for big blocks?
3) Only with the blocks actually found by miners voting for SegWit?
If not (3) I suggest the dissenting miners to move to another pool.
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:54:33
To activate SegWit need 1916 blocks in a retarget period of 2016 (95% of the blocks/hashrate).
There is one year to activate it, around 26 retarget periods and 26 possibilities of activating it.
Given more than 10% (12.6% today) of the hashrate (and blocks) are mined using Bitcoin UL, these blocks are not voting for SegWit.
Statistics at hand, with 95% of the hash  rate, the probability to activate SegWit in one year is ~100%. 
But it fall to around 50% with 94% of the hash rate.
At 93% the chance to activate it in one year go to 0.5%
No need to go further down to 90% or lower to see if the UL-classic other combined hash rate is 10% or more, there is no realistic chance to activate SegWit.
Remember it is not just the miners using UL, but also the miners failing to upgrade to signal in favor of SegWit.
Just 2-3% of the network hash rate of indifferent miners is enough to block the activation if added to ViaBTC, Slush, Bitcoin.com and the rest.

If there is enough potential demand for bitcoin transactions over the 1 MB limit currently allowed by our overlords, a minority fork (without replay protection I want add) could succeed .
The point is the demand for transactions not fitting inside 1 MB blocks will become demand for the BTCs mined or usable in the minority branch. Greater is the demand, greater is the price of these coin.
Greater is the price, greater is the hashrate attracted to the minority branch (and smaller is the hashrate in the majority branch).
If enough hashrate is available at the fork, there could not be the need of a reset of the difficulty. Just allow huge blocks if they are mined every hour or two and ask the users a bit of patience for the first days/weeks. The small number of coin mined would be covered by the huge quantity of fees collected (10 - 20 times more than a normal block every 10 minutes).
It is all about the market demand.

I do not support Segregated Witness as it is.
If, like me, more than 5% of the miner's hash rate do not support it, there is no way to pass it with a 95% of support. 
Given there are around 26 possibilities during the next year to pass SegWit, if hash rate supporting it is just 93% there is just 0.5% of possibility it pass.
At 90% it is ridiculously microscopic.
I support Flexible Transactions.

Call it a 51% attack.
And would be very visible by every actor in the field (unless the competing block is found just seconds later).
The Majority of the miners would be against it, because they would not like to be in the same network with assholes using their power to attack the competition.
This would cause a secession of many miners (a very hostile hard fork) and a big damage to the network reputation.
The miners seceding would have no restrain in mining a competing hard-fork with every increase of block size they could implement.
ANd many service providers (exchanges and likes) would support them (because staying in a chain with miners colluding to kill the competition would be bad for business).
And be sure, when a competing chain with way bigger capacity in out, the korea's bonsai branch will wither pretty fast.

The stable price in front of an increasing supply of bitcoin imply a growth of holders' holdings.
If the new coins are used as long term store of value, this is $ 1M to be exchanged every day for BTCs and the growth of the BTC market cap is $1M/day.
But, if they are used for payment purposes, the value of the exchanged bitcoins increase $1M/day.
Currently there are around between 100K-400K BTC exchange every day on the network. If all new coins are used for new payments needs this imply the value exchanged grow at least 1%/day. And this would be much more significative.

In an inflationary system, you want save as little as possible and spend as much as possible as fast as possible.
This because if you delay consumption (buy stuff) you end with less purchasing power.
In the case of sugar, you want  buy more now (because sugar usually is not very perishable) because later it will cost you more and you will be able to buy less.
In a deflationary system you will buy just what you need to consume now and will try to save as much as possible, because prices will fall in the future and you will be able to buy more stuff with the same money.
The difference is an inflationary system you are able to consume more today but less overall; in a deflationary system you will consume less today but more overall.

I would not be surprised if it took just half of it (10-12 years) to have ubiquitous everyday uses for bitcoin (and GB sized blocks).
It is true money have a very strong network effect, so bitcoin growth is fueled by its past growth and every one joining the network is making it better and more useful. BUt the reverse is true for fiat moneys. Every one leaving is causing them to lose value and making them worse and less useful.
Bitcoin enjoy the ability of work in many cases where fiat do not work, so this is a place where fiat can not out compete it. But as Bitcoin take over the marginal cases where it is more useful than fiat, its utility grow and there are more marginal cases where it can now be used and outcompete fiat.

There is technology in development and deployed:
nuclear power plant on barges developed by Russian firms.
So, if we could have some seasteading in the next few years with a barge powering it, placing a mining plant could be economically interesting.
The mining operation could use the power in excess produced by the power plant (nuclear plants are base line, not to be tuned up or down a lot) allowing a very cheap electricity power.

I do not say random checking is enough.
I say many nodes host at homes with normal hardware could just KEEP a random selection of blocks.
Anyone needing data they have not, they just ask around to other nodes with the right selection.
If a node "identity" is represented by a random number (say an hash), it could drop the blocks more far from his hash.
Requiring a node to have 1 TB dedicated to the entire blockchain would severely limit the number of full nodes and then the times the blockchain is replicated. If the node is required to have just 100GB, the number of nodes that not qualify would be a lot less.
So, instead of 1000 full copies of the blockchain we would have 100.000 copies of 10% of the blockchain, every one partially distributed.

1) Continuous 50 new coins just add complexity to the protocols, because you would need to manage an ever increasingly number of coins
2) if you keep the issuance stable to 50 coin, inflation would fall a lot slower than it did. It would have needed 10 years to fall to 10% and 20 years to fall to 5%.
The high inflation would have made bitcoin a lousy store of value compared to many fiat as it was before the first halving and inflation was 25% to fall to 12.5%.
What allowed it to increase in price was adoption, but would not be enough to lift it over 20 or 30$ by now, if inflation would be a lot higher than now.
3) Anyway, at some time, inflation would fall so low it would be indistinguishable from zero. So, why not make it just zero at some point. Better if in the lifespan of the early adopters.

A small minority of the hash rate will have not a functioning branch.
With 10% of the hashrate, a branch would find block every 100 minutes (1 hour and 40 minutes) instead of 10 minutes.
Already with the existing number of transactions this would DDoS the minority branch, that would be able to process 1/4 transactions at best (there would not be enough blockchain space to fit them all in).
Then, they could try to sell their coins to exchanges, but if these are on the large blocks chain, their block will be invalid.
SPV client will support the large blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:48:34
There is no need to limit blocksize to push fees up.
As miners can include only the transactions the want, they can and will reject every transaction making the block too much large (and slow to propagate).
So, it will be:
1) transactions paying more than x per KB
2) transactions paying more than x/2 per KB
4) everything else if there is space enough.
Larger the block, larger the chance the block is orphaned by a competing smaller block.
Smaller the block, less fees collected.
To make the block larger there must be a much larger fee reward available.
This also would incentive the miners to have better network connections and not only cheap energy and cooling.

The transaction volume in USD is the same as one year ago but:
1) the price in USD of every single bitcoin was more than double than today and 18 months ago was four times.
2) The previous point imply the net value of a lot of people invested in Bitcoin is 1/3 or less than one year ago.
3) People spending these bitcoin are locking a comparable loss if they bought at 500 or 1000 or at 300.
4) Usually, in these cases, people would see a reducing volume, not a volume holding. Because people with less savings try to save more and spend less.
5) In my opinion, as the price of BTC in USD fell, the volume due to speculation was taken over by actual uses as a payment system
6) This is spite of a 10% inflation for the BTC and a 0% inflation of the USD in the last 52 weeks.

if the chinese miners are unable to propagate their blocks fast enough, they will be at a disadvantage.
In fact, it would be like they had a lower hashing rate than they actually have.
And, if miners outside China with a good enough bandwidth knew they had a stable advantage over the chineses, they could as well invest in Mining rigs, get majority of hashing, the fees and mine 8 GB blocks.
8 GB blocks have a lot of fees inside, probably enough to offset the reward of the block even now.

No, because adoption of bitcoin (demand) is greater in comparison with adoption (demand) of USD.
the number of bitcoins in the last 12 months raised around 10.5%, the USD M1  raised 5.x% and the M0 raised around 0%.
But the adoption rate is wildly different for the USD and BTC.
So, the demand of bitcoin is roughly enough to offset the devaluation due the greater inflation at this point.
It probably help bitcoin the simple fact no one could just increase 40%  the supply of BTCs in one year, like the Fed did during 2013 and the ECB did in 2012.

If we suppose all blocks would be maxed out as much as BIP 101 allow, the revenues of miners would skyrocket and they could allow themselves to build / finance / pay full nodes on the network to serve blocks/data and safe keep the blockchain.
Not only, this would imply the value transferred with the blockchain would be increasing at exponential rates. Not only with the number of transactions but also with the size of transactions and the various uses possible.
If we must fear this growth, whats the point?
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:26:22

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

The miners can HF with a minority of the hash rate, in the right conditions.
The minority can overtake the majority if the market sees the minority delivering a more valuable service than the majority.

I wrote "even if" for some reason.
With a 75% of the total hashrate the 1 MB blockchain would be able to find just 1 block every 40 minuted for around 2 months, before resetting the difficulty.
Given the mean blocksize is just now over 500K, the 1 MB chain would not be able to confirm all transactions, just half of them.
Think if this happen in March, with 750K mean blocksize, it could just have room for just 1/3 of the transactions.
In the same time, the 75% blockchain would find blocks every 13 minutes and would be able to confirm every transaction.
Where, as a business, would you be in the next two months? In a chain that confirm your transaction fast and cheaply or in a chain that do not confirm half of your transactions (or none at all) and if it confirm them the fees are astronomical?

Upload bandwidth is a problem for miners. They spend hundreds of millions in HW and SW and labor and energy. 
They can spare some hundred thousands for a good 1 or 2 Gbits simmetric line (like the one available to private customers around the world)
1 Gbit/s upload line would able to manage 8 GB blocks with ease if xThinBlocks is used.
Again block verification time is a problem just for miners (because time is money). 
Txs are verified, independently, when they arrive to the node. So, rebuilding the block, when the filter is sent, skip the verification of the transactions (already done) and just verify the merkle tree of the block and the 1-2% of txs the node could not have already in the mempool. And this can be done very very fast.
I remember in 2006-9 Shareaza could hash around 200 MB/s of data with three different hash types (TigerTree being one).
If we get to GBs blocks (probably not in a year or two) I bet there will be extension to CPUs or GPUs to accelerate what need to be accelerated. 
1 GB blocks could yield 3 M txs. This is around fro 30K$ (~333 bytes/cent ) to 300K$ (33 bytes/cent) every ten minutes.

Gold have no cap on transactions.
Given the smallest denomination possible (1g coin) there can be around 100 billions coins of gold

Actually, with 25% of the hashing power, the losing chain would confirm every 40 minute for around 60 days.
Given the current number of transactions, it would be able to mine just half of the transactions with all full blocks. The rest would go to the mempool for two months --&gt; ~2.1 GB of mempool
When there is a retargeting of the difficulty, if the number of transaction is the same as now, they would need at least other two months to work out the rest of the transactions.
If the transactions increase it would be a loto worse.

1) NO
Major mining facilities have ASICs designed to be remunerative even after the halving.
If minor miners drop out, there will be a slow down of the network, but it will not be major.
Also, miners can reduce their hashrate during the two weeks before the halving and then fire up all their mining capabilities after the halving. This would compensate the minors dropping off.
2) Nothing new here.
3) Everyone and his dog know this
4) As (1) Probably not true. Professional miners in China and elsewhere already did their math and, if they didn't, they are better broken and gone.
5) Blocks slow down, the mempool go up, blocks full, fee go up, people complain, Ethereum (or something else) gain market share.
This all would not be a problem if there was blocksize spare capacity. But Core's Developers wanted their fee market, the blocks full and give a rat ass to users needs or wants.

Bitcoin as a good store of value depend on bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange and being liquid.
More it is used as a medium of exchange more it is a store of value.
It is not only the fact there will only be 21 millions bitcoin, inflation always go down and tend to zero (and a bit lower than zero when mining end).
It is the easy of use, the protection from seizure, inflation, censoring, etc.
To be a good store of value it must be used by a large number of persons. More use it, more they use it, more stable will be its value (and more it will grow before becoming stable).
The security of the network is maintained by the miners. In the end, the miners will be only paid by transaction fees. Is it better, more stable, more decentralized to have 150K tx/day by 150K people or 1.5B tx/day by 1.5B people. The source of revenues to pay for the security of the network is more stable with the first or the latter?
If the 150K are controlled by third parties intermediating the needs to transact of the 1.5 billions, no normal people will be able to do a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.
1.5 billions per day on the LN would pay for 150K on the blockchain every day. 1 cent to transact on the LN would become 10K$ to transact on the blockchain (if all the value would be transferred to the blockchain and to miners). The LN keepers would easily spend 1K fee per transaction and keep the other 9K.
LN tend to centralization because more people use it, more it become efficient. And it would behave like a bank.

The fact Bitcoin can be decentralized do not imply all nodes need to have a full copy of the blockchain.
If we will have billions of users for Bitcoin, we will have millions of copies of the blockchain. Just every large entity will have its own copy of the blockchain. It is more practical than having to query someone else copy on a remote server controlled by someone else.
IMHO, every government of Earth will have at least copy of the blockchain, every single large entity like Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Baidu, ISPs, General Electric, General Motors, etc.
Like near all large entities will have, at least, a token activity in mining. Just to make difficult to anyone else to be able to pull a successful 51% attack.
When you have hundreds of large entities, all around the world, with their online copies and securely stored backups, it will be very difficult (like nearly impossible) to censor the blockchain without wiping out the entire planet.

Your fee market (also production quota policy) prevent miners to adjust the size of the block they mine to the fee the users are willing to pay.
The block size should, naturally, grow with the average fee/byte
Larger fee should pay for larger blocks, not to throw out cheaper transactions. More money spent on fee should mobilize more resources to enlarge the blocks mined.
And miners would compete to lower their cost per byte in the blockchain at the advantage of the users.

The price is, now, stable at $250 with mining of 3600 BTC/day, with a slight increase in price.
This imply these new coins are going somewhere and not sold to the same people, depressing the price and forcing users to use more coins to pay the same amount of $/€/£.
If we suppose the supply will halve, the demand for BTC will increase the price until there is a new dynamic equilibrium between new coins mined and coins use to execute transactions.
This could easily double or more the price.
If we suppose all the coins mined today are sold to the market, this imply the market exchange 8.8 M$ every day for bitcoins and there are transaction for, at least 50 M$ every day (around 200K btcs every day change hand). If you suppose a end price of 500$, you would need just 100K BTCs for exchanges. If the same number of $ would be exchanged in BTC as now, this would require at least a two weeks to eat thru the 100K BTCs the market need no more to execute transactions.
On the other side, the people interested in using BTC as a store of wealth would increase, because inflation of the money supply (the tax paid to subsidize the miners) would actually decrease to less than 5%. And this is the real engine to get to The Moon!!!
The increase in price would surely mobilize a noticeable quantity of coin actually on hold. But probably not a lot. This could be what some goldbugs call "the rally that not sell". A lot of people could not be interested in parting with their coins at "any" price level.
And, if the Fed. start the presses again (if it have not done so covertly already) This could be 2013 all over again.
A lot depend on how many tps are available on the blockchain, because more transactions transactions imply more utility in the bitcoin network and more valuable coins.

It is even more complex that that:
1) If the miners are not able to make a profit, they will stop mining.
2) As some marginally profitable miners stop mining, the others will get his coins and become more profitable.
3) The price is set by the intersection of the demand to buy coins and the demand to sell coins.
4) Bitcoin is used daily to pay goods and services. The value of the goods and services sold MUST be the same of the value of the bitcoins used to pay for these goods and services. If the value of 1 BTC go down, more BTC will be needed to pay for the same goods and services, increasing the demand for BTCs. If the price go up, less BTC will be used to pay for the same goods and services and the price will go down because the demand for this use will fall.
5) Point (4) imply more transactions in the same period of time will increase the value transacted, increase the price of BTCs and mobilize BTCs available only at higher prices.
6) To keep the price stable, for every new coin mined must be transacted as much value as the price of the new coin mined. If the number of coin mined halves, and the new value added (adoption) stay the same, the price must increase to compensate the new value added to the network.
It is a bunch of feedback loops for you electronic geeks to consider.

Venezuela sit on top of very dense and sulfur rich oil. In fact, they must export a lot of oil because only the refineries in the south of the US are designed to refine it (after blending with other lighter oil).

It is about every 1500 blocks.
Now, to get 10% of the network hashpower you need around  $ 20M in rigs (plus the HW around the rigs), some place where housing them, 20-50 MW of power and a few dozens of people maintaining it.
To just steal some bitcoin with an attack that would destroy the trust in the network. This would devalue the stolen coins and the rigs.

The characteristic feature of capitalism that distinguishes it from pre-capitalist methods of production was its new principle of marketing. Capitalism is not simply mass production, but
mass production to satisfy the needs of the masses.
Liberty and Property, p. 9
Capitalism or market economy is that system of social cooperation and division of labor that is based on private ownership of the means of production.

A lot of BTC are moving from weak hands to strong hands.
As the movement is completed, the price start to skyrocket high.
As the price skyrocket high, the network become better able to manage transactions with larger values (in fiat money terms).
Currently a big fish entering with 1 M$ position and buying bitcoin is able to move the market 5-10% up. And big fish able to move 1 M$ are, really, feather weight fishes.

Bitpay will "sell out" only after the clients have "bought in" bitcoin.
Larger the number of vendors, larger the number of clients, larger the demand to buy BTC in the market.
Zero sum?
No, because there is a time lag between the buy and the sell of BTC, where the BTC are in the possession of the buyers. More buyers imply more demand for BTC and higher prices for BTC, because there is a limited number of them.
If the exchange rate of the BTC raise between buying them and spending them, the buyers could end not spending all of their BTC and holding the change to use it in the future.
This will reduce the supply in the future and will raise the price higher, again.

My estimates say 4000 to 1000 is possibile, not probable, but possible.
The big problem is the net present and future inflation of BTC, compounded and the present and future inflation of $, £,€ (etc.) are very different. 
So there are a very big incentive in holding BTC and this can fuel a hell of a rise and the price could run too much ahead.

The solution for these problems is pretty simple and require not a lot of hassles:
1) My bank accept SEPAs until 17:00 and send all of them at 17:30. You can delete them until that time. 
2) Just send a SMS, mail, to the user when a SEPA / wire / whatever is executed with a link to confirm the transaction is legit (or a number where to send an SMS to confirm the transaction).
Now, for example, Bitstamp send you a mail to authorize a withdrawal in BTC or fiat after you have logged in with the double auth activated.
They (the thieves/robbers) should take control of account ID and password, auth token, cellphone, know the PIN of the cellphone, mail ID and password.

If they ban it, they lose control of the entry point.
If they are able to ban it.
Remember they only control and have authority over the fiat side of the exchange.
If they lose control and can not see what is happening in the network, because the have closed the visible entry points, they would be blind and unable to affect the network.
Just like with drugs: 
If they regulated it in a reasonable way, they are able to exert a modicum of control
If they prohibit it completely, they are unable to exert any control whatsoever.

I'm not sure bitcoin will buy two loaves of bread next month when it buy one loaf today.
But... Bitcoin have a limited number of coins and a limited ratio of coins production. Fiat money like the US$, the RMB, the € have not these built-in limits. Given human nature, who have the power to print the aforementioned fiats will abuse its power (willing or not willing).
In Bitcoin this can not happen.
So, in the medium long run, there is a very large probability the value of bitcoin will continue to soar compared with the value of other fiat currencies even without an increase of adoption.
But, with an increase of adoption, because it is a better form of money than any fiat currency, the probability the price of a loaf of bread will be halved in a month is very large and one tenth in a year is even greater.

Heinlein defined them as "Overeducated idiots".
They hate bitcoin because it is outside their grasp. They know a lot of facts but don't know how evaluate and interpret them.
They have not a model, a logical theory, of how the facts and data are connected in a causal way.
A blogger wrote this ". There are far too many of our generation [he is born in 1946] that are, as my dad used to refer to such people, “overeducated idiots” — people so lacking in any foundation of reality that they have to have labels on their shoes to know which one to put on what foot."
Another wrote "The French are a pretty conservative people, just ruled by a narrow clique of overeducated idiots and hangers-on desperate for a place at the top of a pretty narrow economic pyramid. Think of the whole US being run by 150,000 Bill Clintons and you have a good idea of what the French have to put up with every day. A Frenchman I know said a few years back that he had only just now realized why I was so angry when Clinton was in office (speaking of Chirac) because (and I quote) "Just when you think it can't get any worse, more embarrassing, less sophisticated, or ahistoric, he does something else even worse."
They hate anything and anyone they do not understand (and there is a lot they do not understand). Fortunately, as they do not understand, they are pretty ineffective in the long run. Unfortunately, in the short run they can do a lot of damages.
