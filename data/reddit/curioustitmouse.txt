Submissions that are mostly about another cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. It's right there on the sidebar.  I wonder why this post hasn't been moderated away as off topic.

I agree. Which is why I thought the claim of millions of transctions today was bogus. That clearly is not the case 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:08:36
Oh come on. Obviously I was generalizing that blocks are around 1 mb on average. And [if you look here]( you'll see that referring to 1 mb as the block size isn't farfetched.  It's in the link *I posted*, lol. I guess you have to dodge my question somehow. Also, I never said LN isn't a good idea. There is a fundamental problem with opening channels though. A problem that apparently would rather be ignored. 
Merry Christmas to you too. If you ever decide to not be done with this conversation I'd like to hear your thoughts on how millions of transactions are possible as you originally stated. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:26:46
Please link anything showing 2mb is the average. [I can't find anything. ](

Can you explain how millions of people do a few transactions a day with lightning? Wouldn't the on chain transactions to open a channel back up the network like this time last year? I understand that once you have the channel open it's basically free. How do we get from now to millions of people with 10s or 100s of channels each?   This is the biggest issue with LN. There's not enough room in 1mb blocks for massive scaling, even with lightning. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:20:24
Look through my posts and let me know where I said 1mb *limit*. I think you'll find you said that. I was referring to the actual capacity for on chain transactions to open new LN channels and in that sense, 1, 1.1, or 1.2 mb is meaningless.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:51:43
Please explain how those 1.1 mb blocks and that 2mb block from January would do anything to alleviate the on chain transactions required to open LN channels by millions of people. It's disingenuous to suggest a 1.1 mb block is a meaningful increase over 1mb as I stated. An occasional 2mb block and an average of 1.1 to 1.2 mb is not enough. So, I'll ask again. How do we get from now to millions of people with 10s or 100s of channels each?
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:38:35
Please link a 4mb block. [I can't find one.](

Trying my luck, want to play around with gold. And Bitcoin.
