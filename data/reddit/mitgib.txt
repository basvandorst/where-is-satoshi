For a low cost service? Really? The average ticket is about $6 for a month of service.  I know I do my research before making an online purchase, I would rather pay a bit more to someone with a good long history, which is so easy to find via google, and if I still get taken, it's not to the cleaners, it's for lunch money.
Because of the ability of consumers to do charge backs with little to no protection to the business, and now even paypal for intangible services, I added the 10% credit to avoid accepting either. I've never accepted direct credit cards, I do not wish to accept the risk should any user data get leaked in any kind of breach.  I've never had a breach, but I never want to experience the exposure of one.

I don't think anyone here is to blame but yourself, you have to take responsibility for you actions, nobody forced you to fund bitcoin with debt. Debt is a tool, if you do not fully understand the use of a tool, maybe it is best to avoid it's use.

I serve a niche of low end VPS, and I have been in that niche since 2006, and in the general hosting business since 1995. True I could die tomorrow, but barring that, I don't think there is much worry of me taking off as is so common in the VPS industry.

Proper preparation for disaster is 3 days food and water stored, currency(fiat/gold/silver).  If you watch some of the reality shows on preppers, they go to some serious extremes, but do you have a usable trade  that could be used as barter?  All depends on what type of disaster we face, but to have access to drinkable water and food for at least a week seems to be the minimum we should all have on hand.

I've accepted BitCoin via BitPay since Nov 2012, you are right that few use it, but why would I limit how I accept payment when it costs less, and now nothing, and BitPay even provides and updates modules for most of the popular billing programs, so I have zero need to train employees, the customer selects their preferred payment method at checkout.
I've always chosen payout in bitcoin to save on the processor fees, 1% opposed to 2.5% for ACH and conversion, since the volume is so low, and sit on the bitcoins until I either need the funds or I feel the exchange rate is to my advantage.  I've felt BitPay has provided an excellent service and I have no reason to be unhappy, it's up to everyone to do their part by accepting bitcoin before there will be any wide acceptance by the public.

These are some great ideas, for a payment process that currently accounts for less than 1% of payments processed in even the most geek laden industries :(  This is a great idea that could probably be implemented regardless of the ultimate payment and might be receptive if marketed to large fleets who fuel through public vendors. Stopping Jr. from appropriating $20 is not the target market here, when big rigs spend hundreds of dollars each time they fuel, multiply that buy thousands of trucks on the road fueling at public vendors (JB Hunt comes to mind) and you have an idea that could seriously curb abuse and control costs. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:20:18
What stops someone from activating the pump, moving the vehicle, then abuse enabler moves in to fuel?  This is a 30+ year old scam.  Not a true scam, except to the one funding the fuel.  You would see this all the time in truck stops where company drivers would solicit owner-operators and offer $100 of fuel for $50 cash, same happens with food stamps.  I imagine anything can be abused, and I do not see a clear way to stop these types of abuse without a fix that would raise the price so much it becomes not worth the cost.

Paid what with bitcoin? I'm imaging Namecheap, since domains and hosting seem to be early adopters, but you didn't say who you paid.  I've had similar problems with WFC in the past, moved to CapitolOne360, but really use PayPal and their debit card for anyone not accepting bitcoin.

So is bitcoin after all.  I do not understand why people always claim national currency as FIAT never relate bitcoin is FIAT as well.
I do expect the USD to collapse, but not expecting it based on the current oil collapse.  The most logical reason I can think of for depressed oil pricing is fear of US production, so with fewer fields producing by pricing US oil unprofitable being the goal.  The Federal Reserve will cause the collapse of the USD as their ponzi has had a good 100 year run.
Now if the dollar were to collapse next week, would you rather have gold/silver that many more will accept or bitcoin? I prefer to hold both.  I am not that big a risk taker to bet it all on any one thing.  My only desire is to eat daily, and have something others are willing to trade for food. I really do not care if they accept dollars, bitcoin, gold, or silver. It is prudent to hold a bit of each so lead is not needed as repeat trade is very difficult once the situation degrades to needing lead.

Since the cash is deposited into a 3rd party account, this would not apply.  I really can't see any valid reason for using a middleman when the funds are going to a 3rd party account, OP's accounts are never accessed from the description.  About the only thing I can think, would be lack of transportation to the bank, and the credits are payment for running an errand

As a former cross country trucker, who saw first hand the abuses of fuel cards, this is no different.  Find anyone who has cash wanting to fuel, offer them fuel at a discount, collect cash, provide fuel from BTC balance, abuse success.

I am not a gamer and Atari was my first thought, so unless you have the funds to defend it, it would probably be much cheaper to redesign.  It would be hard to defend "causes confusion" which would surely be listed in initial pleadings.
On another note, it is a very nice looking logo.

Joking aside, ease into it if you are considering a large portion of your wealth, make a choice of how much you wish to put into BTC, then over the course of several months, take 10% of your original goal to make a purchase, so you cost average your purchases, you are not fully in at first, but you have skin in the game.  If your wife turns out to be psychic, at least you have something in, if the price retreats from here, at least you are buying more BTC at a lower rate taking advantage of the sale.

This comment sounds as empty as the "code it yourself" argument about open source, if you don't like something, change it. While on the face sounds great, but not everyone has the talent or the time to learn how.  Sort of why the freelance community thrives today to make those changes for anyone willing.
Now if someone wanted to code an easy to use, yet secure plugin for many of the popular front end shopping carts, that would be great. It doesn't even need to be free, but but keep in mind what BitPay is offering to merchants.  From BitPay I get the ability to submit invoices via their API which converts it from USD to an amount in BTC on the fly, and then forwards me the amount collected, for no charge.  I take the balance in BTC, but those who take that balance in the national currencies BitPay supports is how they earn any income, with a small transaction fee.

So what stops them from accepting $5 from someone else to hit you again, in turn raising the price for you to get protection at $10?
Now as for your question, how to obtain bitcoin. That all depends on your location, in the US, coinbase.com is very easy and will accept credit cards after some approval process. But to get them instantly right now, cash is the quickest way of obtaining bitcoin.

Yes I am promoting my service, and issuing an account credit was the cleanest way to offer something different for BTC payments, so any invoice paid via BitPay, a 10% account credit is also issued.  I've accepted BTC via BitPay for years, nothing new there, but the account credit is new.

Since it is a new feature, I will apply the account credit to any new payments, if someone has active service and a BTC payment, they should open a ticket and I will apply the credit for payments for up to the past year.  I do not have a money tree, but I can see feeling left out for anyone who has recently made a BTC payment.
