He means a sell on the bid or a buy at the offer, it tells you who was aggressive and who was just resting size.

How can you call bch as revolutionary as the iPhone? It's the same damn thing as before with a number doubled. It's more like a moto razor. If LN works (who knows) that will be an iphone.

This is a liquidity spike. The amount of bitcoin available for sale is pretty small. Value bitcoin in the short run by estimating probability of total failure, size of near term market cap implied by its usage as a currency, and by the percentage of bitcoin held by speculators. See my previous post on how something like this might look but use your own numbers.

If they are always sending (selling) exactly as many bitcoins as they receive (accepting for merchandise) this is actually the ideal case for LN because the channel will not become exhausted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:34:18
Early on it might be an issue, but seeing as most people aren't doing anything with their BTC, not a big one. If you hold more than your friends in btc, I suggest you allow them to open a channel with you for significantly less than you put in. The more nodes there are on the network, the more it will start functioning like a checking account. If you get paid in LN and you buy everything in LN your channels will rarely get exhausted and you will not need to be constantly prefunding.

While this is true you can also replicate social networks easily, but in general there is little incentive for users to switch. I expect there will be multiple cryptos that succeed but one will be dominant, probably 80% of the market if it can keep up with transactions.

They aren't going to do this on any significant scale because it would be really dumb. The gold market is too small, the price shock would be too large and they would be fleeced trying to put on the position. The Euro is the only other real option today but it doesn't help them, and although a basket of currencies may be a possibility in the future, it is a bit too early for that I think.

Countries would still be able to issue debt against tax collection, they simply would not be able to print their way out of it. In a future where the entire world uses bitcoin, it is possible that wars would be limited by cost but that does not mean they would cease to exist. BTC does not eliminate coercion by the state, and the state will coerce you into paying taxes or rotting in jail, or depending on your level of dystopia, threaten you with violence.

I'm not convinced that the existence of bitcoin is deflationary, in the same sense that the existence of gold is not in itself deflationary. Sure, if everyone only used gold for money it would be, but bitcoin is conjured from thin air by consensus. Nothing prohibits that consensus from conjuring anti-deflationary measures in a pinch. The same is true for the electricity argument, by consensus we can change that algorithm if and when it is necessary, and reasonable alternatives have proven themselves. I think you are being unnecessarily gloomy. Also, I am not a libertarian, but I can't think of a single libertarian who has contempt for democracy.
Edit: did I miss an implied /s?

Yes. Once prices have stabilized (measured in BigMacs if you don't like fiat) a bitcoin address earns no interest, it would be possible to create the equivalent of a bitcoin bank account that funds interest with profit from a diversified portfolio of loans.

Now that I am home and not on my phone I can actually respond with reasonable formatting.


It is very difficult for me to imagine the world much different than it is today, too many variables to know what would work and what would not. I think this is true for most people. I am not *against* what you propose, I just don't know if it is realistic or if there is a path to get there.


For me democracy is the ideal above all other ideals, though they vary in effectiveness and quality. In my opinion, it is always immoral to bring about change in a democratic society (even one of low quality) with violence, so that rules that out. Even though the aristocratic elite in the democratic nations of our world wield great control over people's opinions, it is not possible to change this by any way other than talking to people and voting, without losing the moral right to victory. I am in favor of focusing on small changes over long periods of time such as taxation on inheritance, funding higher education, etc.


A democracy that prevents a belief system from a legitimate path to victory is not a democracy. This is why single party states, or states that outlaw certain parties and belief systems are not democracies. Rebellions against non-democratic governments to install democracy are always justified. There is no mechanism except self interested voting that can morally prevent it from happening again.

I'm not sure what you mean by a crash. What I can tell you is that futures contracts and financial price feeds tend to be rigorously defined, so there may be some mechanical way that the reported fork is determined. I haven't looked into it because I don't intend to trade the contract. There is a similar concept for futures that track fixed income products called "cheapest to deliver" where the exact products the contract tracks is determined by formula. Anyone who wants to trade this should certainly understand how the reported fork is determined.

OPs net worth is probably already large enough that bitcoin is almost a hedge rather than speculation. Also his other assets are likely real assets so will not be affected as much by currency moves. For the already wealthy, all-in bitcoin doesn't really make sense. I think his post is very sensible.

If land and car titles were recorded on chain, smart contracts would allow for those titles to be transferred to you after you finish making payments, or back to the lender if you default.

I'm interested in your opinion, as rent is both a colloquial word and an economic one. I absolutely believe in private property, which means I do believe in "renting" of scarce resources such as land or  apartments. I just think that currently the tools to connect consumers with businesses are inefficient and *necessitate* a market for rent-seekers with capital that can probably be greatly diminished with efficient tools like bitcoin, DAOs, crowdfunding and whatever we haven't thought of yet. Yes power is used to stopper thought as you said, but my hope for the future isn't remotely marxist, it is a world where the relationship between service providers and service consumers is so efficient that the market for capital is chasing very little excess opportunity not already claimed by providers and consumers and all "rent" yields are very low.

I have no problem with communists, some of my favorite people are communists. I can see some common ground with my own beliefs personally but I consider myself a capitalist only because I think not believing in markets is like not believing in evolution. They exist whether you believe in them or not, they may be barter-for-favor markets with party elites but they are still markets. I associate a lot of communists with the same sort of reflexive ideological thinking I see in fundamentalists of messianic religions.
I think the main difference between what you and I think, and I may be wrong, is that I am okay with the accumulation of capital in a single person's lifetime as long as it is not passed on to any significant degree. That's how you get aristocracy.

Maybe you are thinking of anarcho capitalists? Who have disdain for government representational or otherwise? Democracy is a foundational principle of libertarianism: vote for those that make the fewest laws. I should know, I used to be one. I stopped being one when I realized efficient markets aren't always great thing, for instance an efficient market for hit men.

I do believe in private property as a kind of personal freedom, however, I have two beliefs that override it and the first is democracy. If my democracy says I can't have private property, I'll give it up. The second is egalitarian circumstances of birth. I believe that a person should be strictly limited in amount of inheritance or amount received as the beneficiary of a trust over their lifetime. I also think all education and children's healthcare and daycare should be free.
As far as rent seeking goes, I do see a lot of value in people competing for the best use of resources, but that a society can and should democratically decide what is acceptable usage. My problem with rent seeking is mostly a problem of inefficiency and imbalance in our economy, and extreme concentration of wealth that we have inherited from the past propping up those inefficiencies. I am hopeful that technology can alleviate most of that, but I am aware of how bitcoin is in many ways contrary to my beliefs.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:50:58
Okay you got me to look at the contract specs. The daily bitcoin reference rate is currently composed of GDAX, itBit, Bitstamp, and Kraken. Others can be added. I didn't see anything about forking, but it looks like if one exchange is reporting prices more than 25% different it will be excluded. This will provide at least some protection from b2x vs btc reporting. I doubt this will be the cause of any crash and if it were it would be swiftly corrected.

Loans existed before fiat currency. (BTW I am not an anti-fiat zealot.) Plus, since property ownership of large assets like cars and homes could also be put on blockchains, smart contracts could provide a way for loans to be automatically collateralized so that when you don't pay your mortgage ownership reverts to the bank. So the simple answer is that financial institutions and loans won't go away just because of Bitcoin.

Modern liquid currency markets mean denomination of oil contracts is mostly irrelevant except for price stability in the underlying currency. If and when oil contracts stop being denominated in dollars it would most likely be due to an already existing sentiment against dollar stability, and while some may interpret it as a signal, in and of itself a change in denomination would not mean much.

I've been saying that investors are a third party cost that can be disintermediated by consumers and employees for years. Kickstarter and DAOs are a step in this direction. A company that does not have to pay dividends should outcompete one that does in the free market. Free markets are important, as are regulators.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:22:29
I believe it is based on an existing feed from a consortium of bitcoin exchanges, so it depends on which fork those exchanges report. This is just my guess.

I respect you for thinking critically about the world, but I seriously suggest reconsidering this opinion for a few reasons. The top reason being that price denomination of contracts means very little in a world with extremely liquid currency markets where the proceeds (or cost) of any contract could be easily converted. The only reason price denomination of a contract in any particular currency might matter, is for price stability of oil for that country. The problem this presents for your opinion is that the US has not used a large amount of iraqi oil in a long time if ever, and in fact many physical oil contracts are tied to the NYMEX futures price which is denominated in dollars in any case. Not to defend that particular war though.
