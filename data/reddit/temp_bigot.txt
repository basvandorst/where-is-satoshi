It is impossible to verify every line of every piece of critical software you use yourself. So you either rely upon *some* system, whether open, closed, or whatever it may be, or you don't use software.
Open source does not mean that a person has the time or the capacity to read and understand everything magically. It just allows a community as a whole to inspect the totality. If the OS is properly compromised, nothing else really matters. And the Linux kernel alone is more than any single person could ever fully understand and review.

You don't want to see my fits. They're only good for getting ships blown up.

Sweet baby Jesus, I hope you're trolling. If people like you are actually common, I can only imagine how much Bitcoin adoption is being set back.
I'll bet this sort of shit is going to end up in at some point. ;-(
Edit: I searched for "bitcoin" on there and got four results. Fortunately, all false positives. No such customers (yet). Hopefully it remains that way....

Well, I feel all the more smug with my dumbphone right now. Sure, anything on there is probably compromised too, but I don't do banking with it. [And I have plenty of other security vulnerabilities but *shh*, let me bask in my moment of vindication about smartphones here.]

Thanks! Just a fun thought-experiment.


Aye. I wouldn't see them doing it until it's pretty clear they have to. To use the Netflix/Blockbuster analogy: Netflix had little to no reason not to. Blockbuster had those same concerns, and so waited a long time, then tried to jump into the game.
The question is whether there will be a "Netflix" level of brand recognition for a BTC credit service. If not, then the existing ones have a better chance jumping in when the time comes.
And a transitional option would be to use a USD denominated account which has the ability to pay in BTC. So they keep their current credit limit system, but allow a person to make a payment in BTC similar to current foreign exchange systems with some cards (that is, denominate the current-value debt onto the account).
Later on, they could move into BTC denominated accounts which could still work similarly for making USD payments (convert to current BTC amount as debt) and these could run in parallel even (choose if you account is USD or BTC denominated).
The real issue is, if you're giving BTC denominated accounts, what happens if the value has major spikes? How are people going to afford to pay you back? Is there any way to make a "credit history" demonstrating that people will have the ability to earn a certain amount of BTC in the future? etc.

A man deserves a castle, neh?

I forgot about that bit of fun! I always think of the obfuscated C contest. But underhanded is even more badass for exactly what you say.
And thousands? Oh, to have such a small code base. ;-)

I feel like your question is similar to "why would you use credit cards when there are debit cards?"
People want to spend more than they have. That is made easier by having a system which can facilitate loans based on a credit limit rather than just taking out everything all at once.
Off the top of my head, I can imagine basically a 'mastercard' (or whatever credit service) "wallet"/app/web interface/whatever which can make payments for you. So it works similarly to the interface for how you spend your own BTC, but with spending out of this account instead.
And then the issue becomes making credit limits in terms of BTC rather than USD. This is conceivable but risky of course. But that's their business.
The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (I think; that or some other Heinlein books) had the idea of gold-denominated banking. This would be a similar concept.

Yeah, I rather figured it was. I was more joking to myself about the last few projects I've been on. :-)
And I'm always in favor of throwing out the GUI. \^-\^
