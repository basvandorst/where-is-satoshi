his shilling manual says to attack 'Bcash' because it's afraid of being replaced..
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:52:57
i think you're confused about the meaning of some words. 
start with hijacking and continue with forking.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:33:46
what is bcash? if you refer to BCH then i must correct you, it's bitcoin cash/BCH. Bcash is not yet out and is not in connection with BCH. also, controlling ALL of the mining is impossible for any crypto.
hrones hit the nail.. BTC's current transaction fees are unacceptable and i don't see a solution in near future - neither does the rest, hence the decrease in market share..
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:34:33
so suddenly it ain't shitcoin but a competitor? 
thanks for admitting :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:10:38
but you're the one being ignorant..
Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin. Same as Bitcoin Gold is not Bitcoin. If people got problems seeing the difference maybe they're not intelligent enough to use cryptos in the first place. It definitely is not a reason for you to babble about hijacking and confusing newcomers. I also don't see any trademark on Bitcoin logo and i don't think i ever will. It's supposed to be community project. Part of the community decided that the development direction took a wrong turn and forked.Rightfully so -nothing bad about that. As i see it - you're just butthurt that BCH gained more traction and is actually usable in exchange for services/products, so you started calling it 'Bcash'/shitcoin. In terms of intended and actual usage the only shit is BTC..

1st rule in BTC shilling, "it's bcash, not bitcoin cash"
2nd rule in shilling, "you're the shill"
you're welcome
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:59:36
i'm not surprised, really
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:49:45
you won't get another one, i'm sorry
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:18:51
think about this: what if blockstream are the bad actors..
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:44:58
do you throw yourself on the floor too at this age?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:09:26
it entirely depends on how you define the word shitcoin tho ;)
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:41:19
do a double please, single is not enough
feel stupid yet?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:52:50


you missed this part apparently. he trades and doesn't really give a fug about names. you're the one being overly sensitive to bitcoin cash..
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:15:36
yes i do, if you can't see it i'm afraid i can't help you. reading comprehension for some people is just too complex.
no quotas really
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:40:25
ofc ignorance is bliss, denial too it seems - we're talking open-source project here :D
let the better win - you have nothing to be afraid of, BTC is the only one and the rest are shitcoins! just look at the market share..oh wai-
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:34:31


are you? when did that happen? last time i checked the fee was still $29 and no LN existed :)
p.s. you are = you're, you might want to use "your" next time
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:19:20


You're the one that dragged 'Bcash' into this.. are you even trying?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:17:12
the logo contains cash thus is not the same, only slower people get confused imho
it also makes sense for them calling bch bitcoin. they see segwit as a successful hijack attempt. fact is that bch is closer to the original idea.
it's a fork. same as ublock/ublock origin
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:58:53
and which one is the shit? :D
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:08:47


bankster controlled is Blockstream which on purpose let BTC grow slow and expensive so people welcome 2nd layer solution with smaller fees with open arms..  
“Catch The Thief!” The Thief Yelled....
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:18:07
so you wanted to share that LN is being tested by selected few? what a news :D call me when it's in production..
also, writing you're instead of your is not a typo. its straight up being stupid as you have to type extra characters, y'know...
 0.000889 fee? that's your $0.0/ticket? xD
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:02:39
since your IQ is obviously sub 90 let me explain it for you:






"Bcash and gold to xmr" means that he exchanged his bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold to monero. hence your 'i was actually advising him to keep it' is retarded as your assumption that he holds some was wrong.. hence me commenting your reading comprehension..
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:36:09
you probably still don't understand that such comparison is not accurate. more accurate would be BTC being gold-painted bus with $30 ticket price and limited capacity on the busiest route in town and BCH being double-decker big enough to accommodate current needs for $0.4/ticket...
now guess which one ordinary folks will use 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:26:51
it scaled already, it's called BCH..
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:54:10
different categories tho, one is garbage-that-people-didn't-realize-is-overhyped-yet the other is actually-usable-crypto.. lol
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:41:11
talking about propaganda and narratives :D 
that's pretty funny considering how you use 'Bcash' instead of BCH/Bitcoin Cash while completely ignoring fact that Bcash is not-yet-released crypto using Zcash technology announced in 8/2017..
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:51:00
how come? if something is shit it shouldn't be able to compete, no?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:19:35
no, no throwing? that's a good boy!
here, have a popsicle
