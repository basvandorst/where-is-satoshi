       without people actually spending bitcoin for thing it will just become a giant scam ( like it is today) 
I think you need some advice by the redditor who goes by the name (holesinthefoam)...
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:19:59
I'm keen to learn and not disgusted...
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:49
I don't think Bitcoin cares who celebrates what.. Bitcoin has taken off and is on a mission..It can help those who ask for it.. I wouldn't be surprised that this is part of a biblical event..Bitcoin is so perfect in form that I think people who try to dismiss it are made to sound foolish and stupid.. I have thought about the negatives of bitcoin and couldn't pick one..Just positives...Think of it as the time the Berlin Wall was broken down..   imo with my limited experience ..

I think when one satoshi is worth one cent then holders will start spending/using/ buy a lambo or whatever, which puts the value of bitcoin at one million dollars a coin as predicted by some..I think this is approx 20 yrs away but in the mean time , bitcoin looks to be an excellent store of value until it reaches that higher value..If people fomo then this price will be reached earlier.. Personally i think Bitcoin can reach a billion dollars a coin if it becomes mainstream because it will have to cover trillions of "dollars" worth of transactions..
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:41:52
I have paper wallet.. Do I get 2 nd coin automatically or do I have to do some procedures..Would appreciate advice..

I can't see the government here in Australia relying on a voluntary tax system.. It's to far left field imo..
I mean who is going to pay for the politicians perks and junkets..No one will voluntarily..
I think that if there was a registrar showing who owns each wallet similar to a (bank account) then bitcoin would be more accepting by governments.. Bill Gates as well say's that bitcoin is exciting but it needs  attribution so as the governments know what the currency is being used for , mainly to see that it's not being used for illicit purposes ..Even Jamie Dimon is kind of right when he say's that governments want to know who , what, why, were,when of a currency, I think If Bitcoin was traceable (with a name and a face) by the government, but the information to be used only by taxation office and high security authority then Bitcoin would be far more accepting by governments..And they would have no excuse to ban or limit Bitcoin usage . I personally don't have objection to this because I don't have anything illicit to hide and I would truly love to see bitcoin being used as a currency because it would solve so many other problems...

Thxs for your input and I'm enjoying the journey.. I can't see bitcoin failing because it makes to much practical sense.. and these days so much reminds me of the early days of internet, I remember the big telco companies here in Australia scrambling  to work out how to control internet and mobile phone service and make money from it.I think the banks will be in that  position soon enough..as you said, it's going to take time ..

Thxs for your informative answer..
If you were a government and you wanted to collect taxes from your country that is using Bitcoin as its currency,what system , checks and balances would you use to collect those taxes..
 If I was filling out my yearly tax return as we do here in Australia , would I declare what wallets I have to show a trace of my financial history of each year..
