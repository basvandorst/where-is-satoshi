No, you see a psychiatrist first for the diagnosis, then a psychologist for intervention and psychotherapy work.

No. An M.D. is needed to diagnose mental disorders because many purely physical illnesses can pass off as psychological issues. Psychologists are trained either in research or therapy and intervention.
For example: patient comes in, complains of fatigue, low energy, low mood. A psychologist would say depression. In fact, the patient has hypothyroidism. example 2: patient comes in, looks like he has bipolar disorder. In fact, he has a brain tumor.

Now, show that the group whose opinions you dismiss are nutjobs like you did for Scientology. So far, you are presuming they are nutjobs and dismissing their ideas, attitudes, and beliefs without examination.

You do understand that u/throwaway-o is simply stating opinions and feelings and those are never reason to see a psychiatrist. Behavior that is troublesome or dangerous to the self or others is this reason. What you're pushing for seems to be the use of psychiatry to further politics. This is a very dangerous combination if it were applied, as historical examples like this one attest.

What dangerous things are they doing? I think you're wrong to think that beliefs and attitudes can be considered an illness, and it is *more* dangerous to go down the road of pathologisizing beliefs than letting the belief you want to pathologize be free... Unless you prove their dangerousness, which you haven't. 
So far, you've shown a positive attitude towards measures used in the Soviet Union to persecute dissidents, and the rest, well, in your own words, all you've done is 


Prove they're dangerous or provide a rational argument. If they're wrong, it should be easy. Maybe it's you that holds unexamined beliefs.
