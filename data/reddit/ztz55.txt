The Internet of Money just sounds plain stupid to me.  I don't care that AA said it.  It's corny as hell.

It's the dumbest thing ever.  Jesus you could say this about anything. 
Plumbing is the Internet of Water.   
Roads are the Internet of Cars. 
Copper is the Internet of Electricity.    
Noses are the Internet of Boogers.    
Digestive track is the Internet of Shit.
 
Stupidity is the Internet of Gimmicks.  
God damn people are dumb.

No, it's just stupid.  It's a gimmick and a corny one.

coinbase.com is almost specifically for the US.

Yet I use cash everyday to pay for things--that's the way it's supposed to be.  You save it or you pay with it.  Simple.  This either/or stuff is absurd.  It should be both and it CAN be both making it EVEN MORE VALUABLE.  
It really doesn't matter at this point.  These arguments just go on ad infinitum.  Each day, coins like Monero grow stronger and stronger AND on-chain.

That's absurd.  It has a dynamic block size and disks are cheap.  You've bought into a lie.

10,000 over next 4 years and then 100,000 over the 4 years after that.  The halvings have a real effect and the world has to have at least one real currency that isn't manipulated by man (supply wise).

If enough countries switched, the US would practically be forced to switch.
