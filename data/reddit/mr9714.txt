Thanks. Great post

I've watched every documentary I can about bitcoin. These questions were not addressed. 
Do you have a documentary you can recommend? 
Also the questions can easily be answered if there was an answer. Your comments seems like a scapegoat answer. Which worries me more.

Now we're going somewhere. 
But what if they just removed the torrent website altogether, in this case all the torrents by default would also be removed. For example, say there's a decentralized Facebook, yes it's decentralized, but what if you removed the code and the foundations of the network itself. Just like they can increase the blocksize if they agreed on it, they can also increase the max supply by changing the code. Or doing something to the core code that would compromise the unique nature of Bitcoin (I'm assuming bad actors are in the picture and are trying to fight the blockchain)

I'm not going to list every bitcoin doc I've watched. I will need to go back to my watched videos history and that's just too cumbersome. 
It would be a lot easier for you to give me the link of that documentary you're talking about that will help answer my questions.
Let's let our arguement be based on rationality, evidence, and reason. If you don't have the answer, please don't waste our time just for the sake of interjecting. 
You're right, there are some things I don't understand, and those things I've posted here, so i can have someone help me understand them instead of having someone state the obvious and be redundant by telling me that I don't understand.

Same goes for me, community police chief.
Relax dude, i'm here to learn and understand, you're here to attack posters who have questions. It's none of your business what questions I ask, this a thread that I started. If you have something constructive to say that will benefit the community then please go ahead, if not, you're just contaminating the thread and wasting other people's time, as you've been doing. Don't be selfish, there are others out there who this information can really help. People like you are the people who just like to trash talk to others behind a computer screen.
You think my attitude is garbage, I think your attitude is garbage. I'm here to learn and other community members have been kind and helpful enough to take the time to answer a fellow community members questions. You on the other hand are just here to insult, stop wasting my time and others' time. I'm ignoring you, you're toxic.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:16:43
You assumed I'm trying to expose some weakness, which isnt the case. 
You're right I'm ignorant with regard to these things and this is my time to learn. I like discussion learning as I can ask questions to help solidify my understanding. 
You're right in that the reddit community can be very helpful, and the answers I've gotten from others have been very valuable and they've helped me learn. But also reddit communities are filled with people like you who dont actually provide anything to serve the community other then criticize and personally attack. Did you're comment provide any sources or links or information that addresses the main post? No. So why insert your useless comment.... 
Advice: before posting next time, think to yourself, am I progressing the community in any way by posting this comment, if the answer is no, then dont post 
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:47:58
Cheers for that

Regardless of whether or not I've seen any of those videos (talks and docs are different btw); it's courteous to show appreciation to someone who took the time to collate a series of videos for you. You really should brush up on your manners.

What a snob. If you had the answer you would have just answered it. Why personally attack me for trying to understand something that evidentally you yourself dont understand... 
Comments like mine when properly answered will equip others with knowledge to answer similar questions should they be directed at them in the future. It does nothing but serve the community, increase confidence and ultimately aid in increasing adoption. 
Your comment serves no purpose but to attack a person who's trying to engage the community in a healthy discussion. Comments like yours contaminate what could be good reddit threads. Just focus your energy on building and making constructive comments that help the community move forward as opposed to feeding your arrogant and condescending personality

Great analogy. 
But what if the government goes after all the miners to seize all the hardware. Why is that impossible? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:42:24
Nope, not a troll. Just someone trying to understand from people who may know better. Obviously you're not one of those people, because if you were you would have addressed my concerns instead of accusing me of being a troll.

Can you explain why bitcoin can't be shut down while others can? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:27:10
I've studied the tech well enough. I bought at an ATH and haven't sold, evening during the bloodbath. So no panic seller here. Just wanted to get some wisdom from the true veterans 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:01:52
This is excellent for adoption. This is exactly how you get new people into the sphere. Once they get their Bitcoin, they'll search up on it as soon as they get home, and the rest is history from there.

I have questions, but I won't ask because I don't want to get downvoted anymore than I already have. This was my first post on this subreddit and maybe my last. I can't believe a genuine question can get you downvoted so much on this subreddit. Really discouraging and cuts off any form of intellectual discussion. Thank you for your answer, I appreciate that you made a genuine effort to give me the best answer you can. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:31:50
That's good advice, thank you. 
I'd love to hear others' advice as well (with reasoning), keep em coming please.

The 'religious officials' in Egypt are corrupt. According to other sources, cryptocurrencies are NOT haram as long as you don't borrow money to buy it. It's like stock, i.e. as long as the company isn't dealing in anything haram (e.g. alcohol, gambling, banks and their usury etc..). Then they don't see anything wrong in owning cryptocurrencies.

Everywhere is aware of gold. Not everyone knows about bitcoin.

Inflation's coming to get you.

I wouldn't exchange a currency that cannot be diluted for one that can. BTC is a no brainer.
