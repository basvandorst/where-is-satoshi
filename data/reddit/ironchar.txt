the problem with that argument is USD is widespead and actually has use to spend... not only in one of the biggiest countries in the world, but also as a "world reserve" currency, other countries.
the hole with that is, indeed, its backed by nothing, and the nation is in trillions of dollars of debt. Peter Sheiff is right about one thing- its bound to collapse soon and taking  lot more with it going down.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:10:37
good question- this is the big news here!
I guess bitconnect shutting down and peoples tendency to look to the fears takes front seat
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:03:46
I knew people who got into this way back in the summer...
we found that bitcoin rose SOO high that you would've made MORE if you just HODL without bitconnect
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:10:57
massive. widespread adoption will be gamechanging.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:29:43
ether will jump- but not overtake bitcoin....
actually... the model is there to dominate...so we'll see, but then won't ether suffer the same transaction problems?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:42:45
hell no-
not without solving the ridiculous fees and slow transaction times.
when its cheaper and faster to fed ex private keys then to actually move the coins on the blockchain you know we have a fucking headache of a problem- that defeats the WHOLE PURPOSE of why it exists.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:30:45
fuck this I want to spend-
looking for a new galaxy a5 (2017)... can someone link me a site that sells them new and accepts bitcoin? newegg.com is absolute shit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:45:01
these people are idiots and they are jealous they missed the opening surge.
no one crypto has really "crashed" and they are all still up quite a bit from last year.
the REAL challenge is acceptance in use of the blockchain and crypto currency for commerce and transactions.
oh... and office jobs suck serious balls. I know tech has you staring at a computer screen all day but did you all know sitting is the new smoking?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:48:22
cause its a hot topic- everyone else around him is.
easy to see with 400% gains in a year
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:29:41
How can we be fully rational with all the tucked up scenarios happening in the world and btcs rapid rise right now?
Also it fell 80% cause majority of value was held on one trading platform...while coinbase is a major player...do you think this will repeat again?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:26:54
lol of course its a remix!
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:00:06
actually one of the key rules of investing is to lower the risk of loss as MUCH as possible.
diversification is one way of doing it.

youtube comment structure is the worst...
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:22:34
its great if we can use it to spend... however bitcoin seems to be mostly a buy and HODL.... not send and circulate... and its getting harder to transact with it!
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:18:17
except when the hell can you figure it going down? it only keeps going up- its unusable for wide adoption at that rate
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:39:57

scary. the world collectively is not ready for such change
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:06:12
we had a general meeting on friday at my day job at a manufacturing shop.
 our boss makes mention near the end "I get slammed for this all the time" 'Jeff, why aren't you hiring locals-' here's where I think our company gets praise for globalization cause we do it right... when actually its cheaper to bring work over to china in manufacturing and the Philippines and we save 15% on a tariff cause of their free trade agreement that coming from our country would pay... that we we can hire all engineers, customer service experts,etc and its a win win"
yet he missed a point which we never talked about... the tradesman, the shop fab guys and the guys who actually do the work. screwed
the government and small business has been clouting and clammering for skill trades people in construction and manufacuring in our region for some time... and no one will train, no one will pay well... 
its off topic but I had to make note of a personal frustration. 3D printing is next after BTC
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:32:58
not really...

@_date: 2017-11-03 04:48:30


I love this... the line we've been waiting for.
streaming was the same shit and started it for media...
bitcoin powers through with the banking world.
just wait till 3D printing gets going. a gamechanger. a company in Vancouver is already starting to 3d print structural steel for houses cause apparently we don't have enough labors to do the job- horseshit in my opinion companies just don't want to pay the wage but there it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:02:08
as HODL, its the only way...
buying and sellings Gs an S'es? not so good.

years down the road maybe. fiat has to be total shit- its getting there but not qiute
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:04:32
no.... if USA banned bitcoin... the american "federal reserve dollar" would plummet. causing america to be an embarrassment to the banking world and countries like japan and Canada would benefit massively...MASSIVE

@_date: 2018-02-06 03:53:18
too high too fast...
not that its dropping it makes more sense to buy...
it keeps droping as of now though... I'd hold out till it levels

nothing this massive of a scale has been such an awesome alternative to the fiat system we all know pisses away.
why I love bitcoin so. BitTorrent and steaming media was just the beginning. bitcoin and 3d printing will become game changers of the future
@_date: 2017-05-02 02:36:59
I sold a majority of mine a week back when it was at 1700 (CAD) to buy a cheap under market value minivan. Ipretty much doubled since I bought in little at the 750 mark last year
hey, it came when it did and I made double... but holy shit the mark up..
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:50:17
ahh yes...
Crypto ,like the internet is completely boarder less.
another special value it has
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:46:40
so what? buy and HODL
this is piss in the water compared to what most have made so far... and will be piss in the water for months to come

@_date: 2017-05-27 02:59:56
smart man- its coming out that mutual funds are a major scam- too many taxes and percentages being taken out.
I'm exciting for the future- in the long run bitcoin is gonna change the game for money as we know it- its already started... fiat currency has long overdue ran the show for too damn long and its not working
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:54:45
what the hell makes you say that?
I can go and buy bitcoin from an ATM- I can't do that with any other crpto or 'ethereum'
the minute you make a mass market adoption of use an functional usefulness potentiality easy for the masses (like the iphone), thats when you have a landslide deal. bitcoin did this awhile back with atms and more and more business are slowly starting to accept it.
ethereum? not so much
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:29:53

this is worth its weight in **gold**...

it was even better peer-to-peer system

bitcoin? not so much.... but crypto will be the future of how we transact and use money
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:32:03

it'll drop maybe... it won't go to zero.

however, it will not **"go to zero"** don't be so fuckin stupid. crypto is here to stay and bitcoin leads the way.

man this is exciting....
they said the last collapse was a heart attack and what they did merely delayed the inedible... there was no real escape...
