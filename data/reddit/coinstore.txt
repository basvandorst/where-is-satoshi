oh, looking at it, we might be able to use a MicroQR code, which allows 35 characters to be encoded. Bitcoin public keys are 34 :)
We'll look into it.

We don't know yet in which position they'll do it, but we were thinking vertical would make the most sense - as you say :) The tolerance between the two pieces 5mm. So quite large indeed. We're prepared for disaster on the prototype though. 
Thanks for the detailed questions!

Right now, you just send us the public key when you place your order. 
We'd like to be able to generate wallets too, but the security implications (for you) are horrible. If we can come up with a smart way of generating wallets and getting you the private key without ever seeing it, we'll offer that. (Anyone who wants to help with this can get in touch!)

Here you go sawtoothy:  We made this for you :)

Nothing, that's the design: you twist them apart when you're ready to use it, breaking the locking pin. We could actually do away with this bit altogether since the inner code is encrypted, but it seems a nice symbolic touch to snap it when you're ready to use it. Or not? :p

Hiya, first to your last point -- we thought of this and that's why you don't give us your private key; you encode it with a passphrase first. Those pesky workers only see the encrypted one. (Incidentally we aren't great fans of stores where the manufacturers know your private key!)
As to the first point -- , we've been doing a lot of 3D printing too and we _think_ it can be done. So far it checks out at the printer, but perhaps we'll need to modify it slightly -- let's see when the test comes back!

In certain materials, we can get much finer tolerances, so it might be possible to bring this down in size. Show us a pic of the ring!

It's one pixel per mm, with 2mm clearance on each side, total it's 33mm x 33mm. The thickness is 3mm. Will add that on the page :)

We might be able to do it for less than that. We'll look into it. There might also be the option to get it in a cheaper material, while still looking nice.

Hi Osnarf. Yeh: 3D Printed.  If you want to see some high-end type stuff, have a look at izagrun.com. 
it depends on the material about how it's done -- some of it is a 3D-printed cast that gets destroyed after one use. The stainless steel stuff is actually printed in stainless steel powder, which is infused with another substance and then thermically treated to finish it. 
We have a lot of the products lying around here and they're awesome.

Hey. My girlfriend designs high-end 3D printed jewellery and we're both Bitcoin crazy. We were thinking about how to embed wallets in wearables so we made this as a start: 
Hope it's what you need!  Hit us up for a BTC discount or any info on the options. If you think of anything else we can offer, let us know!

About $100.

Because you're thinking you can see the QR code? You can peek at it, but you can't see the whole thing, and you can't twist it to see the whole thing without snapping the locking pin. After the pin's out, the whole thing fits snugly together.
