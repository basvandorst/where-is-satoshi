CME launch and the following months will tell the real story. I think Donny boy is giving a XMAS gift to his new friends on Wall St. A big fat pin to pop the next bubble. Anyone that thinks the government won't destroy Bitcoin and make their own crypto currency isn't really paying attention to our history.

It's Donald Trumps XMAS gift to all his rich friends. They are gonna take a $200BB market cap investment tool and sell trillions worth of futures once all the retail gets long from $11-$15k. Every 10 years Wall St gets to rape Joe Main St in the bullocks. Once the retirement funds get long 25-30% in crypto, it will he demolished and blockchain will be rebranded as "BitDollars" or "AmericanBits" or whatever catchy name Trump gets to say he invented.  Don't ever fade the Sandman.

I had 2,000 coins on Mt.GOX. I'm still a millionaire and wake up with a smile on my face everyday because life is beautiful.

It took me a while to get over it. I hit it big on energy during Katrina and the crude run up to $140 per barrel. I left Wall St in 2013 w/ a big house, $2MM and 2,000 BTC. The worst part of it all is it made me so skeptical getting back into Bitcoin that I sat on the sidelines. I paid $6,200 for my 2,000 BTC. I do believe it's a bubble, I do believe it can come down just as fast as it went up. That being said, blockchain and crypto is the future and I've always felt that way. Even back when I first entered the market.
