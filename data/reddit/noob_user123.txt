They're there..too old for a hack.. Was left as is on the pc with other random pirated sw music.. Has tor installed.. Was talking like drugs.. So what about the fork coins with this one.. Same thing chain out to new wallets then to my personal accounts.. (kids 20 and was gambling with the btc he said.. Now he's a junkie.. I turn wrenches and repair phones and pcs for cash and btc) oh well lemme put my phone down and get greasy again

Here is a technical question.. Got paid in some btc from an long time customer.. Was last year some time.. It was chump change now not so much.. He's since turned out to have ruined his life on drugs.. Any chance this btc could be like tainted.. I was out of the loop before August and now I have coins still haven't been split in two wallets.. Someone please clue me in on what to with those coins.. I wanted to sell those off and buy some alts maybe cash out.. One wallet has been under my possession since day one.. He traded me a laptop with the wallet and coins on it for part of the labor he owed me.. Dunno where they came from and don't want red flags going off

I was gifted a trezor... Probably from Amazon.. What gives?

Thats what I read before posting, Or something similar.  Pretty much I'm safe if btc move first to the trezor. I can handle that from my phone.
once they confirm my old seeds get imported to bch.  where does the gold flavor come in? same seed there too right?  where does eth/xmr come in? still reading up on the other coins and the trezor.
