Like I said, that is still not shorting bitcoin. Future are all settled in cash so you are just shorting the contracts. There isn’t a way to sell bitcoins that I don’t have.

Curious why isn't every exchange doing that already? Are there some technical challenges?

Instead of contributing something useful, this guy just decided to let shit on it and make it worse. Good job

Transfer them to multiple offline wallets and back then up into a computer. Go to the bank and open a safe and pay for the whole 10 years lease. Put your computer in the safe.

You might even consider open the safe in Swiss

He lost me there on the first point. It is hard to create a currency from scratch but it doesn’t meant it can’t happens. His argument is weak.

Then you are still not shorting bitcoin. There is no way to sell before buy from my understanding since bitcoin is stored in our individual wallet. Well unless there is an exchange that let you short from their own wallet
