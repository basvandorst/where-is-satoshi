Waited for more than 10 days for activation :-(
Decided to close my account.

This shit is utterly retarded. Fuck bitpay. I am contacting all companies asking for alternative.

Usually never huh?

You are not doing anything wrong, Bitpay is an anti bitcoin company, and as such are forcing you to use a payment protocol that most wallets don't support. Ask the merchant to use another bitcoin gateway.

It cost less but not 0. They are however not saying that in their payment screen.

Except the fees are not that high. Right at the time I was transfering the money to Name cheap, I also transferred money from my hardware wallet to an app wallet. 30$ for $0.25 and yes, confirmed in the next block ~8 mins. 
So, no, nothing is wrong with the Bitcoin network now. Bitpay is running scam, they also haven't adopted SegWit. They must be trying to recover from all the looses after betting in BTrash's failure.

Yeah... it's a vendor, so I don't get to pick their payment processor.

I am trying to top up my Namecheap account with $15 using Bitcoin. It turns out they use bitpay as a payment processor, and they think that a 13% fee is reasonable while at the same time promoting Bitcoin Cash that presumably has zero fees.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:21:41
Gotcha, so in the case of BCH the fee doesn't exist because BCH is automagically converted to USD at cost 0.

Could you elaborate on what's a random ass service? Bitcoin, Bitpay, or Namecheap?
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:07:56
Maybe by paying 13%  in payment fees, which is absolutely absurd. But I dunno, just an idea.

I chatted with one of their agents yesterday too. I hope they listen...

Will you be prompted with the private key after successfully solving the last puzzle? Just wondering if someone could reverse engineer the binary files and find the private key directly.

I truly belive that Comcast abuse of power and incompetency is lowering American competitiveness and even putting national security at risk.
Incredible that the federal government hasn't done anything.

I don't think it's a true quote. He is paraphrasing the infamous "I don't see why someone would need a computer with more than 64KB".

E.g. Solving a sudoku is hard, checking a solution is easy.

Same applies to Bezos, if he starts dumping his Amazon stock it will plummet, first because of an increased supply and secondly, but maybe more importantly, because of the signal it sends to the market that the CEO of a company is disposing his stock.

He told me that Uber passangers couldn't pay with Bitcoin as they are of course paying through the official app.
He said however that he also offered private rides, and those paid cash, credit or Bitcoin.
He was using coinbase, and I tipped him through there. We had a good conversation, where I explained that by storing the coins in coinbase, they were not really his coins, instead I suggested doing some research on hardware wallets, minding that the responsibility of the coins is then on him.
