trying to withdraw ETH from binance to my gdax / coinbase account but when I try to scan my QR code for 2FA it says invalid. How do I go around this? I want to get my money out of binance

I hope you’re gonna keep some for yourself. I wouldn’t donate ALL your coins... I’d keep at least 5-6mill worth of coins :|

so in terms of tracking the price here, what's the more accurate site? I'm looking at Binance, GDax and coinmarketcap and they all have different figures

Honestly, there is no concise answer to any of your questions. Bitcoin and crypto-currencies are a new standard that don't yet have any regulated rules.... so futures tomorrow could crash bitcoin to a few thousand dollars or it could skyrocket prices. Lightning from what I've read is more or less going to make the process of receiving and distributing bitcoin much safer and more efficient while making it a faster process too. Of course that's an ELI5 but that's the gist. In terms of the third question, Bitcoin is the one that exploded and has the most momentum right now. Not many people even know what Bitcoin is though, so how would the other, smaller currencies take off if the most popular crypto has a hard time getting its name out there? It was the first and normally that plays a huge factor in terms of being successful.

So I ask you this... you kept some money for yourself right? Or did you donate every single bitcoin you had? Far better person than i am
