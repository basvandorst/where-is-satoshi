Okay so maybe this is a bad question but I’m gonna ask if because I don’t know! **When** bitcoin reaches its limits, what realistically happens? Will the cost still fluctuate, will it still be viable, what ultimately happens?

Okay so I’m kind of in IT myself, have a pretty basic understanding of how most things work, what kind of functions would need to be make to make a certain software work, etc, having a good knowledge of how the block chain works must be pretty nice! That’s super cool!

Okay honestly thank you so much for the reply. That’s kind of along the lines that I was thinking but I’m honestly too ignorant in the subject to give my opinions. I know the basics of the technology and to be honest nothing more. 
I just wanted to know more!! 
Thank you!!
