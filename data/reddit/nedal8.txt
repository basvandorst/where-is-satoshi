The point is that some irrational exuberance will always accompany revolutionary landscapes. The inevitable crash just clears out the frauds the phonies and the rent seekers. It's too bad that some are left with bags after investing in a website that has nothing more than a logo with "under construction" and a 500 million dollar valuation, and that these drag down even the good companies ... Or an ico with a whitepaper and 2 person team no working product and 500 million dollar valuation...  But in the end, things work out how they should.

a stop is just a trigger to initiate a market order.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:25:16
It is an "effective" blocksize increase. Just witness data is counted as block "weight", maintaining backwards compatibility.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:07:06
a stop limit, can either be a stop loss, or a stop buy.
So when you set the stop, if the current market price passes your stop limit, you either buy or sell at market price.
Whats the purpose? stop losses are for protecting gains, stop buys are for getting in on breakouts. 
The use in the situation you're describing, is if the price dropped so fast that your order never fills.

Anything that can hash sha-256  can mine a bitcoin block. You can even do it by hand with pen and paper.. (not realistically possible, but possible in principal.) 
You're odds of actually finding a block increase the more hashes per second you can do. 
A single S9 asic miner can do 14000000000000 hashes persecond. Which at the current nethash would give you roughly .00015% chance of finding a block per day, .0045% chance in a month. .054% chance after a year 1.08% chance of finding a block after 20 years, assuming the difficulty stays the same as today. 
So if you had 100 S9s you'd probably find a block sometime in the next 20 years.
But you could get lucky!  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

There is no such thing as intrinsic value.    
Some things provide utility to people, and things that provide utility to people are likely to be valued by people. But there is nothing intrinsic, or inherent about any of it.    
A thing is valued only relative another things of value, which are determined by people.

Good question. Ask em,
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:49:09
Yes...    
I would wager that many who see the beauty of bitcoin also side with austrian economics. You could think of bitcoin as gold, and lightning as a disintermediated provably gold backed dollar. The blockchain could never support the worlds transactions and remain decentralized (like gold), It must be the settlement layer, with other layers leveraging the blockchain exponentially. 
The groundwork must be layed before considering blocksize increases. Segwit does more than just add transaction capacity to the blockchain, it lays the groundwork for lightning, which will allow the blockchain to support orders of magnitude more second order transactions.
If segwit gets adopted, and then lightning gets adopted, and THEN blockspace is STILL too scarce, only then should a blocksize increase be discussed. 
Bitcoin needs to have fees, Blockspace should be scarce. What would pay miners once the block subsidy runs out?
Why would anyone adopt segwit, or LN if transactions were free/miniscule?

Eh.. coins aren't stored in accounts. They are on the blockchain. Your coins are stored by thousands of nodes across the world. Not sure why pinging a receiver would be necessary.  
Maybe pinging a node you trust? Running your own full node is even better.

fees are high now, so making small purchases isn't economical. And it's true that the value of the btc ive spent on purchases would have been more economical to hodl in hindsight.

It's basically an auction market. Currently a lot of wallet software's are bad at estimating. If you can set your own fee, checking the mempool is a good idea to see what's going through and set accordingly.
To answer your question, no one sets the fees, just miners are inventivised to prioritize higher fee transactions, and there is limited supply of capacity, so it's supply and demand.

A ponzi/pyramid scheme, transfers new investor money, directly to older investor money as "profits".
Bitcoin is just traded on an open market. You can see the difference can't you? There are no guaranteed returns. People believe in what bitcoin stands for, and is trying to accomplish, and they want to own some. This is just supply/demand and an open market.  It is nothing like a ponzi.

"without even considering the
second order effects from increased capacity."
What this means, is that, using segwit now would save people/businesses 50-70% of the insane fees we see now, however the increased capacity using segwit provides, would clear up the mempool so much that baseline fees would be much lower, and you'd see even less fees.
But we're only at 10% adoption?

if the address that received the bitcoin starts with a 3, its most likely a segwit address. You can send and receive with any address, segwit or not, you only get the benefit of lower fees by sending FROM a segwit address though.

Sure, the combination of price increase and more use has caused high fees recently.  The market will sort it out. Perhaps enough transactions move to an alt, then that alt had high fees and bitcoins are low again.. Then what?      
Is the club down the street with a line around the block unsuccessful?

Low ish float, so deep pockets can move it pretty substantially. Not too well distributed. Still quite a few large holders, who can move market substantially.
Also mining kind of exacerbates it. MI ers have fixed costs, as price rises, they don't need to sell as much to cover costs, which reduces supply further. As price plummets, they need to sell more /all to meet fixed costs, further increasing supply.  
But mostly just thin books and low market cap.

If you feek bitcoin is a good store of value, Hodl all you want, but if you can, ask for bitcoin as payment. Wether it be freelance programming or just selling something on Craigslist. Ask to be paid in bitcoin. Maybe even give a discount if paid in bitcoin. 
This gives people incentive to exchange fiat for bitcoin, and for you to hodl. Ever increasing the price.

The main concern I have, which hasn't yet been expressed in this thread.. Is that it requires a contentious hardfork. Will 100% of people agree to follow the fork? If not, then who is bitcoin? It's a tumultuous path with many variables. 
Segwit is a backwards compatible soft fork. And although the current fee situation isn't immediately remedied, it offers solutions to these issues in a much more elegant manner.

Sure, a country could ban anything they want. They wouldn't however be able to enforce such a thing. Sure, it wouldn't be as convenient as if it weren't outlawed. But short of disabling the internet, and or power off. They couldn't stop it.
They could ban it, but that doesn't mean it's not untouchable.

Actually, bcc is by definition an alt coin, because it's a hardfork (changes rules). Segwit is a soft fork (adds rules, doesn't change them)
That's not to say hardforks are inherently terrible. Just you can't claim the name if you don't follow the rules, and someone else does.

True. 
So.. what's the question we are trying to flesh out?
What would happen if the US, or another stable country banned bitcoin?
Not much. Innovation would move elsewhere, probably some political backlash. Then business as usual. Until things did become unstable, and there is actually a NEED for the type of services crypto could provide. Then supply would move to where demanded. Regardless of laws.

Until they dont.
It's arbitrage, any usd/crypto pair is arbitragable if there are also crypto/crypto books. Depending on the book depth, youll see some elasticity between them until one breaks out.
to illustrate with easy numbers.
say 1btc is worth 1 usd, and one ltc is worth 1usd, so naturally 1btc is worth 1ltc. 
so theres orders on the books for all these pairs, btc/usd, ltc/usd, btc/ltc
say btc goes up to 2 usd, you could buy 1 ltc for 1 usd, then trade it for 1 btc, and then sell it for 2 usd.

since transaction cost is based on bytes (size), the amount of inputs affects the cost. inputs are received balances.
if you received .1 bitcoin, and then send .1 bitcoin, it will be cheaper than if you received .001 bitcoin x100 and send .1 bitcoin.

Just skip to the conclusion section.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:04:49
December is slow. 
January things get spicey.
Futures can help lead a market, If there are many shorts/puts on the books, thats a negative leading indicator. Conversely, lots of longs/calls its a positive one. 
Large firms have capital to spread either fear or euphoria. 
will they short and spread fud? or will they go long and spread hype?
Before you can sell, you have to have already bought. 
== HYPE
Liquidity in bitcoin while large in the cypto indie investor space, is smallish time to wall street. It may be possible for large firms to actually make long calls, then cause the price of those options to gain in value themselves buy just purchasing on the open market, with the relatively low float, a liquidity spike could send those calls through the roof, mitigating the actual cost. 
This could fuel the largest speculative bubble in the history of mankind.

Honestly, you'd be fine with keeping them on coinbase/gdax until you feel more comfortable moving them around. People just dont want to see another MtGox happen, and also the spirit of bitcoin is being personally responsible for your money. Having them on coinbase is basically like having them in a bank. But of all bitcoin banks, coinbase is the best, most insured, legally compliant of them all.

I had spend a lot of time learning about bitcoin and the whole ecosystem around. I just got that feeling, this is going to be a big thing, in 20 years, i don't want to look back and go "DOH, i knew that was going to be a thing, why didn't i put my money where my mouth is?" Google, Netflix.. etc etc. 
Had to do it. And I'm still dollar cost averaging, buying the dip. 
The price could drop to 100 dollars tomorrow, but my conviction would remain, and my strategy unchanged.
That's the level of conviction i feel anyone can attain by truly diving in, and seeing the big picture.

The strat:
Throw up intimidating wall supporting the price.
While people buy just above, and on the way down to the wall, you sell small bits periodically.
Once you have offloaded your target amount, you cancel the wall and let the price plummet,  buying back up slowly as it does so.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:19
And i said nothing about miner fees. 
there is no "switch to lightning"
lightning is its own thing that settles via bitcoin. no contentious forks required. 
So there are still bitcoin transaction fees while opening and closing payment channels for lightning. And transaction across the lightning network may or may not have fees associated as well, but they're expected to be minuscule. Those would go to whomever is running the lightning node, and in essence staking bitcoin.

Haven't seen the show in quite a while. But one thing that I did notice about the show, other than the titles, when they do "smart speak" it actually makes sense. 
You know, in some movies they have the nerdy person say some smarty pants things, using big words, to which someone usually reply's "English please". But most of the time the nerdy talk doesn't actually mean anything. However in Big Bang Theory, when they do nerdy talk, It is usually coherent.

Honestly, don't expect a lot of btc volume. However it could be lucrative still, as the cost for accepting bitcoin is minimal (I assume). And people wishing to cash out, or take profits may see direct purchases as a way to avoid tax liabilities... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:04:22
You don't have to wait. Most of the point is that you can sell the option to other people. If bitcoin goes beyond 10k, the price of that option goes way up.

Basically, you'll want to move your bitcoin out of that wallet, into something else.
Then expose the old seed to a bcash wallet. Then you're free to do whatever you want with either. 
coinomi is a pretty good wallet that also supports bcash, if you dont wanna do the electron cash thing.

I don't think a modest blocksize increase is off the table. However, it's also important that segwit, and other efficiency measures are incentivized. 
Increasing blocksize pushes todays problem to tomorrow, when those blocks fill up again, since people just go back to squandering the resource. 
Hardforks arn't something to be taken lightly, and I think the next hardfork should have not only a modest blocksize increase, say 2mb = 8mb weight limit. but also a whole host of other improvements and fixes to make sure that it gets passed overwhelmingly, and adds the most value as possible.

Yes, It's real easy to make a plan, and think all logically when there isn't really stake on the line. Now maybe you understand why everyone drills it in over and over. Don't listen to your emotions. Use your head. Stick to your plan.

Waiting for confirmations shouldn't be a worry with lightning. And as it is now, zero confirmation transactions are probably less of a risk than credit card chargebacks. As long as the merchant has a way to verify that a fee was attatched, which is fairly easy.

The real difference is if the merchant selling goods convert to fiat or not. If they don't, that value is still within the bitcoin economy. If they do, then only any fees are added value to the bitcoin economy.

No currency value because volitility? Debatable. Not a great medium of exchange independently. That's where bitpay et al come in. The forward outlook is that as the coins distribute, and true price discovery is achieved,  volatility will be reduced to levels that are more medium of exchange conducive.

The idea is that transaction fees will fill that void over time as adoption and scale increase.

it's basically an accounting nightmare. 
anytime you receive a pool payout you need to record how much it was worth at the time you received it. that counts as income, and pay tax on that as income.
anytime you sell the crypto for usd, or other goods, you need to calculate the cost basis of the crypto to see if you have capital gains/loss, that is taxed as capital gains.
Then you also need to figure out your deductions, equipment costs, power costs, maybe even office space etc. these can be used to mitigate some of the income tax. And then theres self employment tax ..

Picture this future.
 A payment network exists on top of bitcoin, one where people effectively stake some bitcoin to open payment channels, and channels can network to each other trustlessly, within this system transaction fees are insanely cheap, but once in a while large institutions would have to settle these channels on the main bitcoin chain, one which space is scarce, demand is high.
Payment channel stakers, would earn some for staking, and miners of bitcoin would earn some for mining.

They market buy spot. It's not exchanges that do it. Just people with deep pockets if the risk reward looks right. 
If they drive the price high enough, shorts are forced to buy back higher, which can fuel the pump farther.  Inverse can also happen to longs.

Doubt sub 7k. This squeeze was amplified by an already somewhat bullish sentiment and lack of supply at those low levels. A retrace back to 7500 would be pretty healthy, the higher above 7.5 it stays (if it does), the more bullish.

Sort of. Inflation happens when supply of money out paces demand for it. Printing or spending into the exonomy, or under taxing, can all lead to inflation. Depending on severity in relation to demand.

My best eli5: August 1st 2017 is the decided time to attempt a user activated soft fork, upgrading bitcoins processing abilities. The main opponent to this upgrade is the head of the main company that manufactures purpose built bitcoin mining hardware. Antminer is the product.
They don't want this to happen, because they are enjoying the transaction fees. And users dont like how much mining has been centralized by this company.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:45:22

Totally not a Chinese shill post.
But incase this is a real post.
No, centralizing any point in the system is a bad thing, we don't want any single points of failure, or single points of control. If we wanted that, we'd stick to paypal/banks etc, and bitcoin would lose all it's value.
Just increasing blocksize massively opens the door for node centralization. Anyone who values bitcoin BECAUSE it is decentralized should be against this.

Probably slowly exchange it for monero on one exchange, send it from that exchange to a personal monero wallet, then change it back to btc or usd, via a different exchange. 
Possibly setup the exchange accounts with stolen identities over vpned vpns. 
Then the main problem is collecting the cash. Probably pay some tweaker or homeless dudes to create accounts and make withdrawals.  
Idk

I think a lot of the increase lately is people selling off alts for btc in prep for the fork. After the fork, I'd anticipate reinvestment in alt speculation, which would drive down btc prices at least temporarily. How much though? That's the million dollar question.

@_date: 2017-07-13 01:21:53
Nope. Unless you have enough miners to control 50% of the total hash power. Even then your odds of finding the block and paying a cheaper fee is 50%. 
That's why it was setup this way.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:29:37
Without going into too much detail. The banks would waste an enormous amount of money, previous bitcoin owners would be rich, and a different crypto would jump in as the defacto.

Before doing a chargeback, see if they have any support, it's possible they just didn't attach a high enough fee, and the tx timed out?
