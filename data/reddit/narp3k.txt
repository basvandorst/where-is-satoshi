Calm for you maybe, OP. There are addicts out there worried about where their next fix will come from and casual users shitting bricks because they're worried about what info there is about them on the SR servers -- addresses perhaps?
Now, this a cheap shot but, did you just smoke a bowl before you wrote your post? Nice day, eh, everything calm... yeah when you're high.

Is it true MtGox started out as a place to trade Magic the Gathering cards and that is where the name came from? I think it is. :)

Lousy PR and having to dig around for info on forums and irc channels is standard for everything opensource. And once you get to the irc channel or forum, god forbid you ask a question...
Quote from the CEO, Mark Karpeles on a wiki page of his:
"You can also ask almost any question on the bitcoin irc channel, but remember to try searching a bit by yourself first." -
