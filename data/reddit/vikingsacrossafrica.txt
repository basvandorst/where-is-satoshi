yes....producing a service and making something would be a start, but just buying coins and keeping your fingers crossed is not investing. its gambling

funny...limited number of imaginary money, the value is not in the limited numbers, the value is placed onto it by people who want and belive it has value....just like flat money......ps. there is only limited number of grains of sand....but not many attach value to sand

but i would be surprised if many people invested thousands of dollers in bitcoin ...nothing like the big pump and dump of last december
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:34:34
i gess all the people posting" to the moon" last December were not in anyway representative of most investors.....or

im not phycic but...i just wanted to point out that its coming .....maybe it should have its own name...maybe " decline day"
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:59:01
true....but when did the majority of people who put money into bitcoin buy in.....im prity sure it was not at 11usd
 
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:37:39
fine...just remember that in the gold rush fever of California a hundred years ago....it was not the miners who got rich. it was the people who sold the spades and ran the whore houses 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:31:13
only if there is a demand for bitcoins......the reason the price is going down...is because there is less demand....exactly like everyone says....supply and demand
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:40:22
sorry your righ...i just checked, well fingers crossed then
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:58:11
not being a hate...just using my eyes...sometime true belivers cant see the wood for the trees, and shout down enyone who has a different opinion....face it, bitcoin is not a investment....its a way to send money overseas cheap ,fast and relatively risk free.....it is not stocks and shares 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:03:55
yes, but considering that most of the coins are owned by a very very small amount of people who have been pumping the price, ( which was easy to pump at 2usd or 30usd) i would be suprised if it ever get high again.....but i cant predict the coming future....
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:33:20
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:37:29
was there a point after the 30usd peak that a year latter it was worth less than 30usd
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:49:05
also worth noting....the limited supply of 21 million coins will not be finished being mined until the year 2140, i gess you guys are realy in for the long run
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:12:59
keep hold of your Aurora coins they said....lol, bitcoin is NO diffrent than all the other alt coins, pump and dump..down down down
