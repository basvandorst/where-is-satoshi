Not all power sources, I meant like a temporary blackout. Like a few weeks/months. Like Puerto rico for example. If a global power outage occurred, a larger problem would exist.

True, but its jaw dropping how nicely they dispersed the bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:51:19
Not many, but that is not my question. I fully admit that cash is not often used, I am just trying to trigger a discussion as to what alternatives can the crypto community provide.
Despite its rarity, cash still exists. There is no physical version of bitcoin. Thus, what happens with a loss of network. Are we all screwed?
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:00:24
Shouldn't be.. The 430k have been dispersed into thousands of smaller wallets..
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:09:56
Then it would be a bit over 262k mined
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:34:12
Thank you for you thought!
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:41:46
Timing a bit off.

Most everyone does not have every detail of hardware wallet memorized. They just have the keys and know the location of the wallet.
If you do use them, the government can just come back and seize your access point back again. It’s a cycle.
For example, if your Trezor gets seized, you need another Trezor to access your money again.
I know my fundamentals.. You do not need to degrade people just because you are trying to make a point.

Thanks for the research!

Went Through!

I am fine with something in the mempool, just noting the 2:10-2:15 10M byte uptick. That is spam..
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:29:22
This is one of the "mismanaged" addresses from MTGOX site.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:01:47
Should go through within next 2-3 blocks, provided another spamming doesnt happen until then..
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:25:37
Yes. There are plenty. The users just don’t start it in the USA. You can participate of those ones.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:21:26
Sadly, you cannot. You can track it a bit, but if you have stored or bought from an exchange you cannot trace an your individual bitcoins because they become mixed.. One doesnt know if they own the original first few, or recently mined unless they have a clear defined math from a miner to wallet, with no batching and mixing..
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:22:52
A large number of people have already been doing this..
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:29:05
Send me one!
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:08:55
Rofl. That is alot of added Dust.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:01:12
They don’t need keys to Seize bitcoin. To reuse it they do. If they take your hardware wallet, they seized your bitcoin and basically took it out of circulation. They don’t need to access your bitcoin, but they’ve seized it..
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:33:13
No. There has been a large uptick in transactions in the last few hours. [Link](
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:15:47
I think thrice..
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:18:22
Im just trying to wrap my head around why..
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:48:59
It can take a while [Link]( It has a 2Sat/B fee, which is a bit on the lower end of fees paid, so you may have to sit tight for a bit. Sorry for not giving a more definitive response..
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:55:58
Yeesh. Sorry you got problems. Thanks for the Link.
Just wanted to see if I got the concept down right. Dont got to be so testy.

Someone likes Spam. xD
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:10:12
Nevermind, More spamming occured
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:12:19
Someone is messing with someone. Either the miners are confirming less transactions, or someone is spamming the mempool. I think its a mix of both.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:40:56
Pure spam. $20 fees for 30cent transactions..
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:34:18

@_date: 2018-02-20 19:16:10
Point made. I mind-blanked on mixers. Sorry about that.

If you go to coinbase desktop site, they show the list of your previous addresses. They state that you can use them again.
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:50:48
I just use pizzaforcoins.. much less complicated.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:16:35
When you cash out. If you want to be honest on your taxes, and you state the institution where you win, the institution runs into problems if it isn’t registered with the USA but resides in it. If the I.R.S. decides to entertain the idea of tracing Blockchain addresses for taxes, covering your arse would be quite difficult.
It should be fine for right now, but in the future, it’s a bit murky
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:31:08
19k Unconfirmed txs.. Jeez
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:57:07
You are late in the warning. Thanks though.
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:40:40
Rofl. I meant someone likes to spam the mempool.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:37:05
Brilliant marketing strategy.. Has this been done before?
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:03:08
Ouch, was just looking at mempool size.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:42:34
I dont care about rank, I just want to be in the citadel
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:31:26
Thank you for this. Enjoyed the laugh. Cheers
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:39:03
It’s batching transactions. Exchanges were not doing that earlier. The adoption of doing so lowers transaction count.

Crypto lotteries have been around since 2015. They just don’t have bases in the USA. People don’t disclose their winnings, but there are still lotteries.
