This is unfair. They should offer discounted coins for people that don't identify with these categories.

Oh no... I really like that number... do you think we can fix it? Or should we just skip it and go to $4,700?

I hope you aren't serious.

I like you.

TRIPLE TRIGGERED ERMAHGERD!?!?
...no, I wouldn’t bet against that at all.

Without getting into specifics or taking sides, what it boils down to is Segwit2x has the hands of the same institutions Bitcoin is trying to get away from heavily involved in its development. In general, the concern is that this will lead to those same institutions having more control over Bitcoin than some people care for. 
I think there are valid arguments on both sides, but I won’t even try to give my opinion on what I think is right. I’m not confident in either side’s evidence or predictions (more so a product of me not taking the time to get fully up to speed... but I do understand at a high level).

Just asked my Brazilian girlfriend to pronounce that word as if it were Portuguese, and she pronounced it as this guy did. Showed her the thread, and she watched the video and said "yeah, he's just saying it like a Portuguese word because that's how we'd pronounce those letters". I made another example in this thread of a native English speaker saying the word mozzarella to an Italian and getting a similar response for our butchering of its true pronunciation.  So yeah, find it a little off base to be giving this guy a hard time for pronouncing it with his native accent and surprised that you as a Brazilian wouldn't defend his pronunciation. 
But then again, there's a lot of things Brazilians do that I don't understand, so whatever.

Has nothing to do with illiteracy. Has everything to do with regional accents and different languages, dumbass.

Please tell me you're joking... otherwise this is a pretty ignorant thing to say. 
He's pronouncing it with the accent of his language. I bet you if you asked an Italian speaker if your English pronunciation of "mozzarella" was good, they'd say exactly the same of you. I also bet you're the type of person that would give a native English speaker a hard time if they pronounced mozzarella with an Italian accent.
