I emailed my accountant. He never replied back. facepalm.

buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:21:45
why does that matter, when the only thing they need to tax is what I converted to fiat. Even normal shares dont require this detail.

Wrong. Libra is going to work, and its definitely better than the current system. Andreas is not saying Libra wont work, he is saying its not the ideal choice.

CNBC is bullish, you know what to do.
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:54:05
People are retarded thats why. They are making arbitrary correlations when the truth is, futures or not, the price was gonna tank. This just shows you the stupidity of the sheeps in this space.

You probably dont get it now, but if you actually listened and used your brain, you will be thanking me a few years from now. I could have even saved your life.

I doubt he brainstormed this lol. I bet it came to him like a flash.
Your process apparently: bitcoin hmm.. money hmmm.. book good.. bitcoin good... bitcoin + book = very good.
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:41:45
well im talking about the video, you seem to be on another planet. no one tells you how to use your time. you waste that yourself.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:58:31
have you seen bitcoin lately?

@_date: 2019-03-12 05:08:45
who cares. that question is neither here nor there, and doesnt change the fact. Saying that men are stronger than women can also be caused by social constraints, up bringing, cultural norms is irrelevant. What matters is the numbers as far as my point is concerned. Asking what variables were involved would help you learn about the variables but doesnt change the outcome.

Good. The next "Wheeee" is about to come.

I think its a waste of time. Its like collecting different types of shit from different animals. Good hobby, but not a very bright idea for a business.
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:10:06
and you're rude.
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:26:00
sure, last time an old man talked about a bitcoin pump. we dropped 85%. I need these old men publicly saying bitcoin is dead before I start buying again.
@_date: 2019-03-14 09:24:42
lol wtf are you talking about? inflation is the symptom not the disease. that wont solve shit. The price of goods would only increasingly accelerate.
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:26:51
Wouldnt it be funny when Venezuela adopts BTC and it plummets 80% more.
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:40:20
well maybe your wife should start getting involved, and tell you to sell whatever shitcoin it is youre holding.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:58:01

Most women are like this believe it or not, I wouldnt single her out. There is a reason 99% of crypto investors are male. Women are risk averse, especially, and especially if they have a family.
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:08:28
Should name it Fiatville or Noobville.
@_date: 2019-03-11 09:28:59
science retard. have you ever read a book in your life. it is not even up for debate. this is concrete science. Women are risk averse, both in evolutionary terms and genetics. Testosterone has what it has to do with. Fuckin White Knight SJW, get lost.
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:51:03
Welp, time to exit crypto. Be afraid when big money is publicizing their bags.

Now you know when its time to pawn your watch.
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:14:43
This is the problem with people, they compare the price with already successful assets. I find it ridiculous when people pull up a diagram of all the trillions of money out there compared to bitcoin. makes no sense. Yea the bitcoin price is low in terms of market cap, maybe theres a good reason why.
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:45:25
You kids are easily amused. You feeling bullish now? Get that dopamine hit.
@_date: 2019-03-22 02:33:11
You're saying that if you burn that piece of paper, then the corporation disappears? You dumbass.
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:37:56
My negativity is actually sensibility. But you cant see that, because youre a deluded moonboy. I get it dont worry. Youre not the only one. That is why more people are losing money in crypto because of the hopium garbage you regurgitate. Crypto will do well long term. key word here is "long". 
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:07:31
Whoa! why didnt I think of this.
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:48:30
ofcourse, you think everyone works for charity? wake up.
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:25:14
All speculation. yes, even that can be speculation. the same way as saying just because there are more miners, bitcoin is thriving.

If you think he needs to prove hes not Satoshi then you are actually retarded.\\
Craig is the winner here, because whatever verdict comes out, he got the attention he needed and he will still claim he is Satoshi. This is the dumbest news I have ever heard.

@_date: 2019-02-18 04:27:49
well in the early days it wasnt too difficult to pump a $1 bitcoin, were not talking about chump change now, where are you gonna find buyers.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:44:11
ikr, are we all just gonna ignore this?
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:38:12
I doubt that would help from people thinking youre still a nut.
