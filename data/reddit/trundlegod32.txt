14 months in jail and he gets to keep the $70 million dollars worth of bitcoin that was 'hacked'
What a fucking deal

Gonna feel pretty stupid in a few years time when that bitcoin is worth a solid 100 grand but you spent it on a kitchen makeover

Holy shit.  Did you wear your fedora while writing this?  I couldn't help but cringe so hard to be honest lol.
Some people seriously lol.  Why can't you just stash away your bitcoin and be happy with your investment?  Why do you need to tell others and take offense when they're not into something that isn't even that widely adopted yet.  Its like you need so badly to 'one up' these other people because you're invested into bitcoin and they aren't.  I am imagining you as a pimply incel nerd tbh because that's how you come off with your story, its just so cringe and petty.

Fucking scammer trash
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:01:22
Almost 30 grand in eth you got scammed?
Whats your net worth overall if you're 'okay' with putting in that much into a scheme that doesen't even sound right, does this even hurt you financially?
Anyway, coming from someone who ate shit when bitconnect went down, just say to learn from it and don't see things as fairytales.
Anyway, those guys are making some serious fucking bank running their little scam operation, especially if they are from a third world country.  30 grand is literally a small fortune in east asian countries etc

Oh okay that all makes sense then.  We should dumpster cryptocurrency because everyone is incompetent of handling it, lets just stick to our current money paradigm where the owners of the money print more of it out of thin air, devaluing what little we have via inflation, while lending it out 10x over via fractional reserve lending, charging interest on the lot, causing the boom and bust cycle of musical chairs where eventually somebody in society gets fucked and goes bankrupt, and as a result those assets continue to be funneled towards the banks/money creators because the interest in their equation on the money they loaned out doesn't even exist in the first place, inequality continues to rise and exacerbate the problems that inequality brings, until the norm in the next few generations is all of our friends/family, children and grandchildren are permanent tenants in their own respective countries for life, and we regularly have articles in the news raving about 'minimalist' living and buying houses the size of a container is the new 'in' thing, LUL.
I wouldn't expect you to understand anything at all about what I just wrote in the above paragraph, it probably goes completely 'woosh' over your head.

I remember him shilling the shit out of some coin back in the day, maybe 3 years ago now, called Quark Coin.  Talking it up so much and blah blah blah
Guess where that coin went? Into the fucking shitter.

What a bizzarre world we live in.  Where the majority of the population works their ass off just to be able to pay for the cost of living, another huge portion works slave labour in 3rd world countries, and another tiny portion has so much money they can drop 5 million usd for a bunch of fucking paintings.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:24:58
Wtf are you talking about, dickhead.
QuarkCoin went to the shitter.  If I bought in I would have lost money.
If your case is that I should magically be able to know when random shitcoins do supermassive runs and then also know to get out before they crumble to nothing, your point is about as solid as a floppy limp dick.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:31:47
Man fuck whatever this old shitbag says.
I remember when he was shilling "QuarkCoin" as the future of cryptocoins on and on and on RT news and guess where Quark Coin is now?  Its in the fucking shitter at a fraction of a cent.
Fuck off

Hate to break it to you, but I don't think FIAT money will ever get 'rekt' and everything turns to Venezuela, ever...  As much as the system does not work and gets forever overladen with debt, those who are in power / rich won't let it fail.  Instead, it will continue to inflate, and the money you have in your savings will be worth less and less.  Banks, who create money out of nothing, then loan it out 10x over (See fractional reserve lending) and then charge interest on the lot.  Theres nothing to hold it accountable, no gold standard, nothing to peg it to, so it just continues to inflate.
Where does the interest come from in this equation?  It comes from the air, it does not exist.  And because the interest does not exist, we will continue the boom and bust cycle which is basically musical chairs where someone gets fucked and goes bankrupt, and the money / value / assets will continue to flow towards the banks.
Have a look at history and how much money was worth 50-60 years ago.  Then again 20 years ago.  And how much money is worth now.  You could once buy a loaf of bread for 25c.  I'm reading stories in my newspaper about people raving about being able to buy $88k houses which are basically 2 bedroom things the size of two containers, and I feel sad for what is in store for future generations if this continues.
I see the only way of safeguarding yourself against inflation, which is basically banks slowly robbing you, is to get onto the property ladder, or to invest in bitcoin.

I refuse to use paypal at any cost.  Any situation, I will DEMAND an alternative to paypal.  Literally ANYTHING.
This is what you should be doing too, boycotting the platform.  Vote with your money.  Yes I've lost / had money locked for extended periods of time by them, and the hassle of getting it back is time I will never get back.
Fuck paypal.
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:33:02
Fuckin aye.
If you told someone that they created new money out of thin air, thus creating inflation and moving the wealth never-endingly from the general community back towards the banks, people wouldn't believe you.
But that's literally what they do.  They create money out of nothing, then loan it out several times and charge interest on it, then everyone wonders why everyone is fucking broke while the banks end up owning everything.

I thought a "Phishing" scam was where people set up websites with one character slightly different or .io instead of .com and hoping for someone to accidentally input their details and then they go steal their coins?
I've been using Eletrum for a few years.  Are you saying my wallet isn't secure?

Three years ago he was telling everyone on Russia Today that "QuarkCoin" is the next big thing.  Guess where it is now?  Its worth a fraction of a fraction of a cent and in the fucking shitter.

Nobody knows whether its going to go up or down.  Anyone who does has his head up his arse and is a knowitall.
All I know is that it was on the bottom for a long time (3-4k).  We are less than a year from the halvening.  Every single time in the past that a halvening has happened, the value of BTC has gone up.  Worse case scenario, you buy in at 8k now, it drops to 4k, you lose only half of your investment.  Best case scenario? 16k? 30k?  Maybe even 100k in a years time or 300k in four.
It isn't a get rich scheme.  Its an investment, you put a decent chunk of change in it, and hold for a long time, and do your part by spreading the word of crypto.  If past trends are anything to go by, I'd say its a 99% chance that bitcoin goes up in value in the long term.
That's my 2cents.  Every other bugger will tell you a different wives tale based on whatever they think or believe.  Do your own research, look at the facts, and make an informed decision.

Fuck him, hes a dinosaur.  Hes gonna croak any day now.  How can an 88 year old man know anything about today's era.  He grew up in a completely different one, fuck he was in his late teens just as world war 2 was finishing up.    
His come up included buying pin ball machines and placing them in shops to earn his first money.  He so old he might as well not even be from this dimension, he hasn't got the slightest grasp or clue of what would be good today. He is old money.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:26:38
Because that's the way bitcoin increases in value over time and always has done.  It slowly increases or goes for a big rally, then corrects violently, then has a long refractionary period where it stalls before starting to rally again.  In the long term it has always performed well, and theres no reason to doubt the future trends as being any different from the past trends.

Hes a boldie head cuckold incel on Russia Today who uses his position in front of the stupid-box to tell viewers about shitcoins that he has a personal vested interest in.
