**Lord’s Compassion Ministry – Loving everyone despite differences**
**TLDR** – A small Christian group of people, spread all over the world (not big organization) that are involved in supporting orphans &amp; widows in Mafubira (Uganda, Africa). Besides basic human needs such as water &amp; food, the 37 children receive free treatment of injuries and sicknesses in a special clinic and are allowed to go to school. I went there myself on December 3rd to help and serve!
The 1 BTC would go into one of the major projects: building a well and buying a farm so they village can perform agriculture and be self-sustained.
I created the website together with the founders, so I’ll link to a few pages but feel free to check out  yourselves.

* The Children
* Why Uganda?
* Pictures of the children
* Results so far
Thank you for anyone who donates! May God bless you!

Sorry to say this but the source of the problem is inside you. I’m genuinely happy for everyone who made money from 1$ to 100$million. People took on risks and are rewarded for it. I’m also happy for people that win the lottery. Good for them! Most people suck at handling their finances and end up 0$ anyways but I won’t feel bad for them. They had their chance. I love seeing these posts of people cashing out aka reaching their moon. I love reading those because I’m part of it! While I’m far from making millions, everyday crypto rises and even someone investing NOW will make some serious gains in 2018. So, work on your heart problem and quit looking at the subs/charts/success stories. And don’t read other people’s misery stories either to make yourself feel better, that’s just weak human character. Stay positive and share truth and love!
