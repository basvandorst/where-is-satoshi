I've been noticing this for years gain more and more traction as I just love talking to random strangers about stuff you need to be 'awake' to care about.  More and more people open up these days and want to have a talk that leads down the rabbit hole.  It's my hope that we're getting to the point now where we're figuring out how to cut out the cancer that makes us all 'slaves' like Andreas says at the end of this video.

On principal alone, people should support and transact on these exchanges rather than theorizing how they should work.  Seriously, about all the government is good at anymore is squelching opportunity, and they are headed fast at all of crypto right now.

I see it just like legalizing marijuana, they see the dollar signs and start making deals with those who will play nice.  Sure it sounds like a good business opportunity at first.  But it's a plan to start engulfing all the potential in the space with the intent of converting it into government revenue and shutting out any competitors who used to do it the "illegal way".  A pure money grab backed by their monopoly of power; just typical.

I've been following the work of Ben Davidson of Suspicious0bservers for years now after seeing his mobile observatory RV driving down the highway in my city and having to see what it was all about.  Now he has led me down a path to greater understanding about the Earth/Solar electrical connection.  This video is a great synopsis of his work for the past 5 years and it most definitely deserves a discussion in terms of how it relates to Bitcoin HODLers.  Thoughts?  Discussion?
