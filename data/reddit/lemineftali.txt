This is why you leave whatever your DCA is on coinbase regular in BTC (or whatever form you choose, whether it’s $100, $500, or $5,000. As long as that is there, it is safe and FDIC insured. AND, any time you deposit new fiat, because it’s there, you can move your new fiat immediately to coinbase pro.

Maybe it’s inevitable. Still, unless I have the keys and I can send it at any moment I want, I’m not considering it owning bitcoin.

I can understand people capitulating on 99% of crypto projects. Especially anything that’s come out in just the past couple of years. 
But I cannot imagine jumping ship from Bitcoin. It is the reason this entire space exists. Look around the world. 
I’ve watched bitcoin go from $4 to where it is now. That whole ride has been filled with ups and downs, and hacks, and fear, and false collapses. 
Bitcoin seems to die in some way every year, and yet it only emerges stronger. 
6/7 digits by 2030.

There is no increasing of the coins in circulation. People make take credit out against their actual bitcoin, but if they don’t pay it off, they lose those bitcoin. No extra bitcoins are created in this.

Think of it like this, confirms are just confirmation that the coins are there and belong to the owner of that address:

@_date: 2019-07-31 19:21:14
I think about it all the time, and inform a few people in my life of my thoughts. 
My thoughts are we turn backwards, as of today, with the interest rate cut. It won’t happen quickly, but we will continue cutting rates, and it won’t be enough. Other shocks will fly through the market, until that level is hit that starts the cascading action. Basically, just like any other of the several recessions in the past 200 years. 
What bitcoin will do, what I expect it to do, is come to life. It may start to fall off at first with the rest of the market, but will get bought back upward. People will notice. After about a week, more people will notice. It will be making news. Then it will continue on. Questions get asked. Bitcoin continues to rise. 
We haven’t had this moment yet, because the rest of the market has always been roaring; so no one knows what it will look like. 
But the fact is there is no ceiling on its price—at least not until it represents the world reserve currency. Anyone can look at a company, like BYND, and be like, “yeah, it’s worth more than it can return”. A company can’t realistically be worth 100 trillion dollars. 
But bitcoins market cap? Yes, it can go there. 
And I think it will.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:41:39
I think it will be more like over the next 20-25 years bitcoin goes up, and the dollar continues to fall.

I cashed out $2k of my BTC and STOCK investments to cover classes back in 2012. Worst decision I ever made. 
Glad colleges are accepting bitcoin, but PhDs are overrated, and a lot of my friends are now a quarter-million to half-million in debt for them with little chance of paying off those loans in the next 20 years.
If you want to take a risk of 6% interest over 20-25 years to pay for your education, that’s your decision. 
But if you are going to use your bitcoin investments today to pay upfront for a PhD, well, I’m going to be honest, I think it’s a bad decision.
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:57:30
Thanks!! I’ve been rolling it around in my head for a while now, but more so since the Bitcoin2019 conference last week. 
I’ve even thought about making them to specification—like if someone wants one that looks like Pinhead’s box from Hellraiser, or made out of a specific type of wood, or even with a screen and buttons so they don’t have to open it and can just Bluetooth transactions. 
I’m just curious if there would be demand for such a thing. I have plenty of tools, and time on my hand. I’d just like to find a corner of the market to give back to my bitcoiner brethren. 
If someone is interested in one, pm me. I’d be happy to hash out some ideas.

38, unmarried, and no kids. All my life I said I never wanted kids. Thought the world was just too dark to be bringing in new humans. 
Recently I’ve found myself sort of wanting a kid, but wouldn’t consider actually doing it unless I could afford to get my friend and I out of the contiguous 48 to raise our hypothetical spawn somewhere else. 
Anyway—that kids future is likely now, likely because in my eyes bitcoin going to seven digits in the next 10-15 years is completely within the realm of reason. I have a checking account, and a safe with a small emergency fund. All the rest of my savings is tied up in cold storage.

38 year-old on the millennial/gen-x cusp, also with student loan debt. I’ve been playing around with bitcoin since 2011, and I haven’t sold any since 2013—but I have seriously stepped up my buying since mid 2018. The more people were freaking out the more convinced I became. 
35% of my paycheck goes directly to bitcoin now. I have several friends who are doing the same thing (weekly/bi-monthly buys), and I see more and more people I know coming on board each month. 
You made the right gamble, my friend. Keep stacking sats—it will pay off.

@_date: 2019-11-11 23:58:28
A couple reasons I can surmise—because raising the block limit was an actual concern for a while, and even though BCH will most likely slowly continue to bleed out value and hashing power, it served as a proxy stand in “as proof” for some people. Also (not minding security), because it’s got less traffic on it, transaction fees are lower and it’s cheaper to use. 
Of course, neither of those really justify its placement. I think it’s just going to take time for it to fade down the scale, especially when you have other shitty altcoins on a race with it to the bottom.

I understand both of your perspectives. People will continue to scalp and scam in this space until everyone on earth is savvy about what’s going on here. But that will take another 10-20 years to happen.
Still, I absolutely believe bitcoin will grow exponentially even without the ATMs or proselytizing. It is literally just a matter of time. And I love stacking sats during the countdown.
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:06:03

But when someone makes a joke, and the intended message is to point out a bad idea in action in order to scoff, to disagree with the point and say, “well, it’s still ambiguous, because time hasn’t ceased”—is to miss the intended message, which is community.

That could very well turn out to be true. But it also causes people to live in a state of constant anxiety, which is corrosive to creative though. 
Grin is working on being an inflationary currency. It makes it a shitty investment at this point, but it’s an interesting proposition. 
I think we will find out in the next 50-100 years what works best for humans, as far as a currency, but I think bitcoin will stay the course for being a place to park wealth and not lose it. Bitcoin has given me a place of peace I was absent the first 35 years of my life—as well as the drive to make and invest money. 
We haven’t been absent inflationary currency, nor institutions interested in pushing them to soak up the benefits—which I feel has cause a sort of Stockholm syndrome in the populace. 
What has been missing is something like Bitcoin. I know by the way it’s changed my own life.

Bitcoin going back to 8.5k is within the realm of possibility, but the likelihood is low considering everything else going on in the market right now. Still, I wouldn’t be shocked if your short worked out for you. Wouldn’t change my sentiment at all. 
Going back down below 4K though is like thinking that the Dow Jones is going back below 10k, or that gold is going down to $500/oz. It would take extreme circumstances for such to happen. 
I’m not sure you realize just how sold on this many people are. There’s a flash point, like &lt;6.5k, where people I know would scramble to remortgage homes to make buys. 
I think price right now is slightly inflated, but I think it’s the market norm now across the board. 
All that being said—best of luck. If bitcoin goes back below $5k I’ll send a video of me naked and throwing away my USD at a BTC ATM.

@_date: 2019-08-17 22:19:32
Confirmed. 
This is the best method I’ve found thus far. I usually buy USDC which has no fees at all. Then I transfer it over to coinbase pro (instantaneous if you keep an amount on coinbase to cover your DCAs), and then convert USDC-&gt;BTC for the minimal maker fee of 0.15%. 
Let’s say you want to dollar cost average buys of $200 per week. If you leave $200 on coinbase at all times, then each week you can go from buying USDC, moving it to CBPro, exchanging it, and withdrawing it to your private wallet in less than 4-5 minutes.

I get the disbelief. Trust me, I do. 
Bitcoin isn’t a bank though, or a tech company, or even the biggest or first of either. It’s the first iteration of a new system of thought and value. I expect it to continue on its rise upward to seven digits. Will it hiccup along the way? For sure. Might something better over take it during that time? Maybe. I don’t know. 
But it’s not BYND. It’s not Nokia. It’s not Xerox, or Amazon, or Facebook, or Apple. 
It’s a rock, for many people, tired of being tossed about in a sea of no boundaries. 
If you can see it’s value behind that, I can admire that.

I ran these numbers myself not too long ago and came up with 22-28oz of gold per bitcoin. I think you are on the right train of thought. Absolutely still a buy as far as I’m concerned. I can’t make enough money at work fast enough to keep up.
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:13:07
I did what you are talking about doing. 
I don’t regret it. 
I was steadily buying in the 3-5k range, and then BTC went off like a goddamn rocket. I waited for a mild correction, and when it dropped back to $7400 I bought a large chunk on credit card. 
With the fees and all, it made my purchase closer to the $8200 price range, but within a week we were past that and haven’t yet returned. 
Even if we return there, I doubt it will be for long at all. Over all I am happy with my choice, but I could also pay off my credit card in 3 months if I really put my focus on it. It’s 0%APR for over a year. It’s only 1.5 months salary. 
All that to say it was the right decision for me. I only wish I had done it back in March when I first considered it. 
Still, I would not recommend this strategy to others. But only you know what’s right for you. Though I agree with others that DCA is probably the best strategy.

I was definitely buying bitcoin back in 2011-2012 when the only place I could get it was PayPal and later Dwolla. I don’t have any of that bitcoin anymore, regrettably. A lot of it went to later buy ketamine at prices like 7.5btc for a half gram, or was sold in 2013 when bitcoin hit $200 and I thought it was the event of a lifetime.

No man—not everyone knows about inflation and printing money. Sure, people know money was printed at some point, but I was a later teenager or early adult before I realized they just turn the printer on whenever they like.

I personally think calling his ideas science-fiction is a stretch, perhaps. Harari may be wrong, but nature doesn’t necessarily legislate that he is wrong. 
Harari takes you through his universe—the way he sees the world. And it’s a welcomed journey for most. 
I admit I skipped parts of his second book, and couldn’t get into the third—but I absolutely loved the first. And there were several moments I had to put down his first two books to take a breath of awe.

The one thing about not having a centralization of power and intellect, is that once you have education and information spread free around the world—via internet—is that other people learn really well. And smart people can get really good at fraud. 
I want to take a moment to say where I think this is going, and I’m happy to share notes. 
There were the established governments of the world and their fiat currencies, and then, in 2009, suddenly there was Bitcoin. Regardless of what you might believe, Bitcoin was not created overnight by a couple of guys at a computer. Bitcoin is the open source evolution of decades at work, by people from all over the world. And Bitcoin succeeded for a reason that seems to get glossed over in 2019—and that is most people did not believe that Bitcoin would work or succeed. Many people still don’t.
Distributed ledger systems to prevent double spends and fraudulent inflation is a new technology that solves many problems, problems like the one posted in this article. And dismissing systems of technology that solve problems is done so at peril. 
Open source systems will one day be better at progress than groups of governments and think tanks. And to make that happen we need coordination, and incentive. Coordination is more simple, and incentive is now available. Fraud is, after all, a global problem. Societal problems, too, are global problems.
When people say, “this is good for Bitcoin”, I know it seems to ruffle a lot of feathers. It’s important to realize that they are also saying, “this is good for progress, and this is good for the financial security of everyone”.
This war seems to have broke out post the-2017-bitcoin/cryptocurrency-bubble, where regulated markets are fighting with Bitcoiners, and Bitcoiners are fighting with other Bitcoiners who’ve forked, and both of those groups are fighting with other newer cryptocurrencies. It’s not a toxic landscape because it’s just idiots fighting—it’s toxic because there is so much at stake here. Whoever wins the upcoming currency wars, will truly have a stake in how our future is written. 
I think the currency of the future will look something like this:
Bitcoin/(further down the road) a globally voted on Bitcoin replacement—global reserve currency. 
Lightning/Libra/Stablecoins/Government CC/BCH/XRP—global payment network (this one will evolve more quickly, because it’s just a payment network, and not a long term store of wealth)
One thing for sure—it’s a lot to process. But, we are talking about our futures. It should be a lot to process. And we need an end to fraud. People born in 2030 deserve a fair chance. This is our means to end corruption—distributed ledgers and global voting.
Edit: Damn, I thought this was the economics or finance subreddit. This was pointless to write here.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:59:27

Yes, that support that held for eighteen hours yesterday while everyone was freaking out and selling.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:49:24
Bought a chunk at $7850 yesterday. Told myself if it goes below $7200 I will buy twice as much. Don’t expect that to happen anymore though. 
There was solid support at $7800–I was up watching until 2am last night, waiting for it to break. I expect this second stage of the panic will be over in a few hours. 
I think this will be one of the last times anyone buys BTC under $7800 without it being a fat-finger or mistake—if not the last time.
Edit: Love that this was downvoted for six straight hours. 
We are all still early adopters in my book; I wish there was a little more cohesion between us—even on Reddit, on rough days. Regardless, wish you all the best.
@_date: 2019-08-18 01:25:47
USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Let’s say I want to buy 10k worth of bitcoin at 10k, getting 1btc exactly for it. 
Let’s say BTC is at 10.6k, but falling. I have 10k, and I buy 10k USDC. I can use it to set a buy order at exactly $9,985 when I’m ready, or I can transfer it out to other exchanges. Having a stablecoin instead of USD just gives me more breadth of option.

@_date: 2019-10-24 17:27:25
I’m sympathetic to your plight. If all I was reading was reddit and crypto Twitter, I would be pretty upset about the state of bitcoin/cryptocurrency. 
But that’s not where the good information is. You have to dig a little deeper. 
I would recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard to start, and maybe picking a few of some of the better podcasts out there to listen to (I like unchained/unconfirmed because it’s just information without being told how to digest it). 
There are meetups all over now, and if there isn’t one near you—start one!
It’s frustrating when you feel like you have become the smartest person in the room. Time to find a new room! I assure you, there are smarter people out there who have been in this longer and are still very much excited about where we are headed. 
It also helps to actual get involved beyond buying and just holding on. You can build a node now for under $100. We are on satellite at this point, so that’s an option too—how cool is that? And we are testing out Lightning. Get in on it and learn. 
It’s in expanding your knowledge, testing out the limits, and helping others to learn that you will really get to see whether this thing has a chance in moving forward.
I bring a new person into Bitcoin about once a week now—family members, clients, even doctors I have seen. They listen to me for one reason alone—I can answer any question they have without getting emotional. 
For the record, I’m short-term bearish/long-term VERY bullish. I imagine will find a new bottom here soon somewhere between our last bottom and where we are now, and years from now, people will look back on this December of 2019 and be like, “damn, why didn’t I get in then.”
It will likely get more hopeless before it gets better. The best time to buy is when no one on Reddit believes in it anymore.

While I agree with the first part, for sure, and maybe even the second (visual)—provided you can see—everyone has nuances in which work better for them. 
Books are so much better for me than audio. My hearing is perfect, but I still watch movies with subtitles, always, because it’s the only way I pick up everything that is said. 
Not all brains work alike. And books are still amazing in 2019–mainly because unlike video, or human to human interaction, they allow for one person, with minimal effort, equipment, or production budget, to convey large ideas and paradigms to another on a mass scale.

What’s going on, it sounds like, is you had a program running on windows that had all the information needed for you to just open it up, log on, and then access your ETH. 
Something happened, maybe you moved the folder, or the app off your desktop, or the node file you mention became corrupted
Nonetheless, if you didn’t delete any of the old files, and you are willing to take the time to reach out to people on forums who might have had the same issues, I think you can still retrieve them.
It took me six years to figure out how to restore a wallet.dat file from 2012. The information is out there, somewhere—or someone who is willing to help you out through this. 
If I was your neighbor, I would give it a shot. 
All that to say, all hope is not lost. Just don’t delete any of the files from the original windows folders that Jazz was installed in. Try to make a backup copy of all of those files. Once they are backed up, you can try to figure out which of the files your ETH is stored in and try to copy it over to the newer version of Jazz you are running. 
If ETH hits $1k again, or $5k farther down the road, you will wish you had made backups or tried to find a solution. I say that from experience.

Coinbase is going to the the easiest and fastest way. If you are buying, you can circumvent some of the fees buy either depositing USD or buying USDC with your bank account, transferring that over to coinbase pro, and then just paying the maker fee by setting a limit buy at the price you want. 
To sell, simply send your bitcoin to coinbase or coinbase pro, trade it for usd, and then send it to your bank account.
There’s a ton of options out there, and some of them are probably better. If you want to make a buy or sell in the next 15minutes though, coinbase is the standard.

I have had a similar slow time in adoption. 
First read about bitcoin around 2011-2012, and thought to myself “oh my god, this stuff will be worth fortunes one day”. I purchased some, set up a wallet, and started mining as well. I later sold, or remember selling most of them at the $20 mark, because I was a broke ass college student, and it was that or cash out part of my IRA (I later cashed that out also, but I digress)
Later, around 2013, I found another wallet I had with some leftover ~.84).  BTC was at $180, so I sold it off happily and pocketed the $150, which I needed at the time. A few months later and it’s at $600, and I start really regretting all I sold off in 2012. Nonetheless, I consider it a ship that’s sailed without me. I try to hide my cringe when I hear people talking about it. And I forget about it—for the next four years. 
In mid 2018, I finally spend a weekend really learning about it. I mean really going back to the beginning and walking through its history from day one. I download bitcoin core and start searching through all 8 or 9 of my disk drives for old wallets. I think back on the previous three occasions when I thought bitcoin had sailed and I missed the boat. I start to realize we haven’t even really touched adoption. 
I’m on board now. For the next 10-15 years, at least. I will likely never be in the 1/100,000 crowd again, but I’m certainly in the 1/21,000,000 crowd again. I’m working to learn even more. I’m considering auditing CS courses at a local university. And that’s good enough for me. I’ve gotten beyond my grief. If things turn out the way I hope, and so long as I continue to live within my means, I imagine I will be satisfied regardless. 
Thanks for sharing your journey of how you got here. Maybe I’ll see you on the deck sometime. ;)

I've actually been able to get coinbase on the phone to discuss this before.  The reason this happens to some people and not others has to do with the bank you wire from.  When I first set up wire transfer to coinbase, I had the luxury of instant accessibility--but later my bank flagged them (what they said).  Or, they flagged my bank.  Since then, it's been a 44 day wait for each purchase.
My guess is that waiting time is time for people to notice if the wire is a fraud.  Either coinbase has been asked to return money to people at certain banks, or the banks don't yet trust coinbase.  I don't quite know which one is holding out.  I do know that my funds have ALWAYS cleared in the alloted time given and I have been able to withdraw from them.  I bank with a local credit union.  My mom banks with a different one.  We both have a 40+ day wait each time.  My girlfriend is with Wells Fargo; her's go through immediately.
I still use coinbase, because the fees are low, and it's FDIC insured while it's there; I just use it when I know I'm adding to my portfolio and not planning to touch it anyway.  If anyone on here can point me to a service with lower fees and slower transaction times, I would certainly not be opposed to moving on.

Doubt it, but I am sure Julian Assange being cornered and force to seek asylum in an embassy had a pretty big impact on Satoshi around that time.  I'm not shocked the real satoshi has and/or will never come forth.

You are a total dumbass.

I genuinely curious; let me say that first. I have no idea what you mean when you say “error correcting”, so please break that down for me. 
What do you mean incorrectly copied the image?
I don’t doubt that it is an incorrect QR code; I would be absolutely shocked if I, of all people, stumbled into a companies egregious error to the tune of $5k. 
But I’m honestly just trying to learn something new here: what do you mean “the timing information is incorrect and the watch glass part overlaps with the alignment boxes”? And how did you figure out the rest of the QR code from what’s given?
Edit: ok, reading other comments and starting to understand what you are saying. I just don’t know much about how QR codes function (I.e. what the rules are). But thanks for your input. I’m glad to be learning something new on a Sunday.
Edit 2: Ok, after some research I understand what you are saying. Hey, thanks again for helping me learn something new.

I have to admit I considered trying, but honestly don’t have the time to commit to it. I love puzzles, but by the time I broke it, even if it was there for the taking, I could have worked a few weeks of honest labor.

Yeah, so shocking that a company that is popular, simple, easy to use, legitimate, FDIC insured, and doesn’t fake volume is still be used. Jesus, people are stupid for not having researched longer than they need to.

I followed your lead, and now I have it all filled [in here!!](  Uhhhmmmmm, what now? Hahaha.
Lets see, there's about a 14x14 part of the puzzle that's halfway obscured--so around 96 blocks we don't know are either =0, or =1.  So what's 2\^96.  My calculator won't go that high, but Google says it's 7.9228163e+28.
I think we should have done the math first.

What was it?
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:41:33
Yes—started with AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserve.   Seems like it only took a year or two though before AOL had a 98% monopoly.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:36:15
I hate to say it, but this was my first thought too. Two people who somehow share a wallet. It seems like it’s bound to happen generating a wallet on bad code without true stochasticity.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:40:11
No one mentions Prodigy?

Keep an eye out. Things will happen and change will come. Save up what you can and be ready. You might be able to find someone who will send you bitcoin in exchange for cash in the mail.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:42:44
Dude, if he ever gets a pardon, and he actually has access to those bitcoin, he would be one of the richest persons on earth.

They aren’t saying “buy”. They are slightly mocking him for saying “buy”.

$7800 was the bottom.  1200 bitcoins were bought there on Binance causing the reversal.  You might still get an order in now at $8.5k, but $7.5k isn't going to happen.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:14:50
Ha! We will see 10.5k by end of week.  Don't give up yet.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:50:10
Reading through all the comments, and this one is most like me. Bought at $4, sold at $20, bought at $110, sold at $200, then when it went to $1200 I felt like I missed out for good and stopped paying attention. Only during the last couple of years did it cement for me, and I took to buying on a more permanent level during the last bear market. Third times a charm I guess. The one thing I retain from being around since 2011 is the fact that I now have real faith that it’s not going anywhere but toward adoption, regardless of pace.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:13:54
Bottom was 7800 on Binance.  Futures and longs have been liquidated.
It's over now and headed back for 10k within 48 hours. Hope you got your buy in,

If I were in your position, and I had cash with which to buy bitcoin, I would simply find a bitcoin ATM near me. 
You will pay a premium on it, but if you search around you can likely get it down to 7-10%. Compare prices of what it’s selling for on local ATMs online against what it is on CoinMarketCap. 
Meaning you can probably get .01 BTC for $110-120 USD. 
As far as I know, all you need is a wallet setup before you go as well as a cell phone.

Ha! I remember spending \~7.5btc to pay for something that cost $40.  Never again.

Just got three price alerts from coinbase in a period of four minutes. Managed to get a buy in at $6684. Unbelievable.

@_date: 2019-05-08 03:02:56
Yeah, but it will be back up in two days when people see how responsible the company is. Anyone that large is a target of hackers. For a company to deal with it like this shows integrity.
