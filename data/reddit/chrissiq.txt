I agree - of course, it's worth it to get bitcoin payments, but I was surprised that imkharn said it won't cost $5000 to implement it.
Sometimes, yes, it will only take 5 minutes and like $50.  But if you already have a payment system, database, etc, that you need to hook up and interact with and test, then yes, it's very likely that it would cost over $5000 for larger sites to implement bitcoin payments.
I highly doubt that it cost TigerDirect less than $5000 to get bitcoin payments up.  Probably a good deal more than that.

I was a childhood friend of Luke-jr.  Can confirm, he is completely crazy.  I recently removed him from my Facebook because he was spamming conspiracy anti-pharma anti-vaccine bullshit and it was the last straw.
When we were kids he was completely convinced that he is actually an advanced android and tried to "prove" it by doing some math and stuff.  When i was 17 or so (and he was a bit older, maybe 20?) he met his wife and married her 2 weeks later.  I don't know how that went - kinda been ignoring him since then.  He's too much crazy to handle.  He's a super fundamentalist ~~Christian~~ Catholic who thinks we're all going to hell and that programming is a pure gift from God.

Jesus Christ.  Very likely he's considering killing himself right now.

As a bitcoin newbie, how do I make people really angry so they will send me mBTC/μBTC/satoshis without having to steal 96,000 of them?

Yeeeahhh.. nothing's going to make me believe this.
