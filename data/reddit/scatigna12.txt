Price disagrees lolz
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:58:31
I deleted it as soon as it changed
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:01:23
I'll look there. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:18:30
My bad, I just didn't go back that far, so what "bubble" is this 6.0?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:21:41
Meant to put Almost again. Oops
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:15:07
Just a reason to Sell, that is all. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:27:48
You're right...chinese just ripped it straight back up. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:30:36
And 2017, on the way to $2000
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:01:56
Coinbase stop orders are horrible. The algos have control of that exchange and the liquidity is HORRIBLE during panics. Put Stupid Buy Limit orders in and you probably will get filled
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:36:24
DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY 30 AT ONE TIME RIGHT NOW. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:05:27
which is scary high IMO
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:07:11
I am not worried at all. The interest is hald of what it was in 2013, until it eclipses that Bitcoin will rise.
going parabolic past 2000
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:33:49
So True lol...don't chase, just wait for the 20% pullbacks and buy :)
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:36:37
Ummm, yes?
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:49:37
This interest WILL go over too the last peaks in the near future IMO
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:36:58
Here You go, I couldn't figure out another way to post this lol
@_date: 2016-12-08 04:10:26
Thanks. That's a shit thread and does not really help me considering I want it instant and in the US. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:47:39
Nope, $2000 was my target back in early 2016 is what I put on it. Had it pinned on my twitter for a while. However I can see this blowing right through that...
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:45:00
I love the "new naysayers" when I give them the abridged 10 second rundown of Bitcoin and they blow off the idea. Then I tell them one of these are worth $900 a piece and see their face lol. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:49:36
2016 Highs gone. Good hunch. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:33:58
Put this up right before the rip through 760. 
Price isn't going to wait for people either. 
[Boolish ]( 
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:15:59
I am long bitcoin, and I own bitcoin. I believe 2000 will be hit, I cannot predict how far or if it will overshoot 2000
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:26:10
It has nothing to do with "hunch" it's price action. 
The inside week and Up has potential to be a very powerful move. 
And you can't argue with that "play"
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:44:24
There are so many people in their 20s and 30s that still don't know what Bitcoin is. It's incredible really. 
Most have heard the term. In one year and out the other. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:47:11
This move hasn't really even started yet...
@_date: 2016-11-16 23:43:25
Shorting does not cause the price to fall because you have to get hit on the uptick...basically someone has to hit your offer. It DOES cause the price to rise when you cover your position. Yes you are borrowing shares however then you are selling them to someone else on the market. When the position reverses then you buy to cover running up the price with actual buyers.
If it doesn't cause the price to fall necessarily however it definitely causes the price to rise when covering. i.e. Short Squeeze
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:53:23
I think that is a VERY good reason. If I am not mistaken past highs were made when transaction volumes spiked And that is a massive breakout
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:10:03
As Predicted. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:17:06
I don't understand why everyone thinks it's always a pump? Makes no sense to me. bitcoin is NOT a pump lol
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:16:40
I'm with this guy, Donate some for the greater good.  
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:42:02
Coinbase tried to say they did not withdraw on a purchase of mine. I'm done with them. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:15:39
Coinbase 1083
Bitstamp 1090
Bitfinex 1092
Huobi 1209
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:51:49
2nd Test of 1000 on Huobi looks to be failing. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:18:15
It was no different than Mt Gox? Or Bitstamp? There will always be bumps in the road 
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:53:57
$2000 that is my target. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:57:10
App Deleted. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:48:21
Yes ear lol. My bad. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:48:47
No offense but that was a tough entry lol chasing has always fucked me. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:13:32
It tried 3 times. Probably not now. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:41:54
Yes I would sell 80% of my coins. I believe that it would come down again. That is how markets work. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:47:18
It's just like the value of anything, what someone will pay for it gives it value. 
If Bitcoin was worth 1% of the total value of gold then it would be worth 3000 dollars if all bitcoins were in circulation (which they aren't yet)
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:20:23
I am more of making a case that Bitcoin will be seeing new All Time Highs in the near future so even if there is another hack or quitter Bitcoin will hold the low, shake it off, and be back to where t is today. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 23:06:36
In the long run...just think about it this way. If bitcoin was worth 1% of the total gold in the world it would be worth over $3,000. 
It will be going up. This is inning number 4 of 9 for this bad boy.
 
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:14:06
Prepare $2000 soon
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:43:04
Did I mess up?
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:53:04
after all time highs. yes. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:48:05
Well, I hope you bought more...and still holding. You will have a winner soon. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:02:16
Wrote about this here weeks ago. $2000 has been my target  since the long basing around $200. Anyone shorting this on Bitfinex or Okcoin are about to get ripped apart when this spikes up IMHO 
 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:35:39
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:12:40
there it goes
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:11:48
Definitely going higher, and definitely before Year End
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:19:40
I 100% agree with you...savings account only is for banks to leverage your money and take the interest you would otherwise be compounding yourself  
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:02:49
Yup I have had this happen to me. Funny when the price was going up quickly as well lol
@_date: 2016-12-01 17:31:43
There customer service sucks. They double charged me once and then I finally got that refunded then when I closed my account they said that they didn't pull from my bank account one time and want to charge me again. Their fault not mine so that is bullshit. I probably won't be using them anymore. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:13:57
I guess I should have clarified the major ones after dollar parity. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:43:52
The thing is...the IRS DOESNT know what the fuck to do about Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:54:22
Wrote about this here weeks ago. $2000 has been my target since the long basing around $200. And it's a small target compared to what this could shape into.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:36:24
30 dollars in 5 hours. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:55:32
Very. Very. Very. Nice...I wouldn't buy anymore really unless you do it now...and then obviously DON'T Buy once it starts spiking over $1000 lol

CNBC always screwing shit up. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:39:06
I agree with you, but i also believe that the media isn't really even involved yet so it has so much more to go before it comes back down 
@_date: 2016-11-16 23:44:44
This is like the Bottom of the second in a baseball game of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:25:25
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:13:11
Coinbase (which I hate) and then send it somewhere else. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:57:59
Definitely save your bitcoin and spend your US dollars 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:34:02
Then I hodl. If it's parabolic I sell if it's linear and holding levels I hodl 
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:58:20
I have bought Bitcoin during every single "crash" that has occurred since 2013 whether it was Hearn talking sh**, or Bitfinex losing money. You buy the crashes. It's going to 2000+ next year. 
It's bullish, still bullish and going to All Time Highs more than likely I wrote here. Also here is another good post by a really good Bitcoin guy. 
 
Everyone in this thread who is mad or seems off kilter are upset they don't own any and didn't have the balls to buy some. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:47:39
Probably in December. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:15:00
It's going to $2000 IMHO - 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:50:46
100% agree...The Panic Buying will not start til over the all time Closing High...and oh boy when this thing spikes over $2000 You will see some Panic Buying.
He is right, the panic buying has NOT even started lmao.

I would love to be able to use Future price action to dictate my trading and entry points...unfortunately i do not have access to that data.
I know the difference between the two...I also know that if a market is making higher highs and higher lows why wouldn't i assume it will continue until it doesn't. Believe me I love mean reversion and i do believe prices ARE random the smaller time frame you go.
however the larger the time frame the more non random the market seems to be...
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:36:04
Because many of the people on this sub can’t trade. That’s why it doesn’t work. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:32:32
So....it does matter
