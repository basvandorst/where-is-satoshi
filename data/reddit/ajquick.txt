So in reality one doesn't need to get 51% of the mining power to deliegitimize Bitcoin, they just need to keep forking it until it is a parody of itself?

Everyone knows bitcoin is just a ripoff of dogecoin.

Digital River is the worst. Made a purchase through a site they operate and they added a few extra zeros to the order total. Charged me $12k instead of $1200...  called their support line in India and there was nothing they could do until days after (when the charge went through). Credit card got over drawn for a day and I had to settle my balance immediately with them for the overage. The next day DR was able to refund the difference and then I had a huge surplus balance on my credit card that could only be used by spending more money. Fuck Digital River.

Maybe add a Guy Fawks (or whatever) mask on there too while we're at it.

This is more Brazil's doing vs PayPal being evil.

I've seen a few sites prove solvency in order to show they were trustworthy.

He did play Steve jobs in that movie...
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:25:42
Technically if he buys them all it will mean the price will skyrocket!

Um. eBay didn't buy PayPal because it was some struggling company. They bought it because it was already the most widely used payment option on eBay... and they wanted dem fees. When was the last time you used a money order to buy something on eBay? Chances are it was long before PayPal was bought by eBay.

Except they shut down Google Checkout last November... 
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:15:56
It only cost you double that in electricity. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:23:48
You did it!
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:12:51
Is this in real time?
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:43:09
That's probably where I saw it. Once of the dice sites.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:20:41
And increase their fees on both platforms.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:52:26
eBay does.

That's exactly what Dorian wants people to believe!

Posting that they weren't hacked from a hacked account... makes sense.
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:43:58
I'll tell people bitcoin is a scam. Please send payment in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:54:05
Since they shut down Google Checkout... I don't see how this will be very good for anyone aside from the App store. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:23:10
Amazon has their own payment service.

When the horse breaks down... at least you got all that horse meat.
When the 21 Miner breaks down... you got a Raspberry Pi. 
Sounds equivalent.

Godaddy makes their money by using a payment method that they can continue to automatically bill non observant customers. Bitcoin doesn't allow that.
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:04:03
You are right, there is less consumer protection with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:22:36
Yeah I'm surprised they didn't immediately get a form email saying their appeal was denied and they would not be reactivating the app for any reason.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:30:59
I'd print it out and roll around in it.

Why does it matter where you store the coins? Why would you mark the balance as zero? If you have the customers money in a cold wallet, you should be able to immediately fund them from your hot wallet.

If the price drops more, I'll setup my business to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:26:09
Remember guys. The value is only worth what people are willing to pay. If you bought at $1200, that's because people were willing to sell at that price... And buy at that price. There were more sellers than buyers... so the prices dropped. Scarcity will be more than supply in the long run. Hoarding large amounts of BTC isn't good for the price either.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:56:40
This is why Bitcoin exists in the first place.. So stuff like this doesn't happen.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:24:38
I'm in the same boat as you, except my business deals in US currency instead of Bitcoin. Business / economy in general is just dying... it is too difficult to run a business here with all the burden that is put on small business owners and start ups, while people are running out of money to spend here too. I have to source many of the materials I use from overseas, because the items just aren't made here anymore. Makes me want to leave, because all businesses here were forced to sell out to compete with multinational companies that moved to China. I don't know where I would go though myself. Is Hong Kong still somewhat separate from China?

How many coins were recovered?
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:25:52
So I can have more Bitcoins for when it goes back up!

Kickstarter does not allow any bitcoin mining projects.

Jokes on you. Google Checkout is no more. This agreement is void.

Coinbase almost fucked me. I transferred my remaining .2 btc there and hit sell. Instead they BOUGHT me an additional .2 btc... And I had to wait a week until that cleared. Thankfully I sold on Thursday when the price was still high.

Your credit card company should be able to process a charge back indefinitely on an item that has not yet shipped.
