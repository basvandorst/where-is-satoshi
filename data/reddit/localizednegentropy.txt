I think it would be much better to contrast stealth addresses with regular addresses, because what people want to know is 'what makes this different from what i have now?'. I might allocate half the space to an equivalent diagram of a normal address/transaction.

The official reason was 'unregulated futures contracts' (like "Price of gold to trade above $2000 before 2015"), but the unofficial reasons were pervasive misunderstanding of prediction markets and anti-competitive gambling industry payments to Congress.
Intrade died because US customers couldn't get money to it, so a centralized solution like this may work via Bitcoin. However, all the world's governments are friends, and I'm not so sure it could establish a trustworthy brand behind ToR, so we'll have to wait and see.

Did you read the wiki article?
Each of the much more frequent blocks of the P2Pool chain recalculates the proportion of shares and changes the coinbase transaction. You wouldn't win shares if yours did not follow the P2P blockchain rules. The result of not winning shares is equivalent to solo mining.

Imagine Litecoin (or Etherium or anything, whatever), if the only way to ever earn any Litecoin was to "suspend" Bitcoin in a special way. Effectively, you 'deposit' BTC to the side-chain.
So initially 0 LTC exists, then you suspend 4 BTC, and you've now created 4 LTC on a LTC account (one that you control).
Now you can enjoy a 2.5 minute blocktime (or, again, whatever it is your chain can do).
Say that you send the LTC to a friend. Then that friend can "burn" those coins in a way that "unsuspends" the BTC that you initially "suspended", but your friend can unsuspend them to an account that he controls. Effectively, he has 'withdrawn' the BTC from the side chain.

When I first heard about Bitcoin (in 2010 on libertarian mailing list I believe), I thought it was completely ridiculous. "You trade real money for this fake money? Why would anyone do this?" Obviously, the BTC network was smaller than the USD network, and as currencies are network-effects by definition this would lead to 1 victor per currency area. No US citizen would want anything other than dollars; no X citizen would want anything other than X currency. The obvious alternative explanation, that Bitcoin was just one of the many successful internet scams (and the siren-music of 'other people are so stupid') seemed so, so much easier to believe.
After reading that first wired article about SilkRoad I changed my mind completely. I then saw that the 'currency area' of BTC was the internet and than there would be reasons why residents of the internet would want special internet money.
Secondly, as weeks rolled by, I started to notice things I had never even thought about before, for example how long it took an ABA transfer to clear, or the advertisements for Western Union fees ("why would anyone advertise this...?"), or that people mid-divorce or suspected of crimes would completely lose access to their resources. Once I was at a party, and they wanted to collect $10 from everyone to offset the party costs, but people generally only had $20 bills. I imagined an older me talking to a grandchild saying "back in my day, we had to carry these little pieces of paper around and just hope they added up to the cost of what we needed to buy!".
After musing on the fact that my phone could instantly send and receive HD video -but not money- to anyone in the world, I begin to hit the internet for some research. Probably the next major persuasion would be the bitcointalk forums, as anyone making a ponzi scheme would probably not take the time to fake days worth of discussions on the appropriate block size. I saw the BIPs, and cleanups of past vulnerabilities via fork, which a Great Project would have but a Ponzi would not. I learned about cryptographic hashing and message signing, surprised to learn that such technology was even possible, let alone applicable.
The last nail in the Ponzi coffin would be when I tried to purchase my first BTC (coming to the disappointingly unique realization that I should probably get my hands on this if I am to understand how it works). The process of sending USD to an exchange was so strange and expensive it makes you never really want to do it again.
TL;DR SilkRoad article, Why would anyone advertise “Send up to $50 for only $5!”, crypto expertise on forums.

Yes I think you are right...I was originally using the term to describe an agent holding 'your' money such as InTrade.com or a Bank which would have to trust to administer the prediction market. I was not referring to traders who own a different portfolio of States within the same market as you. With traditional insurance the agent plays both roles hence our confusion.

I tried here and [on bitcoin talk]( where else should I try? 


It does (I think). Also hopefully you are not confusing Owners with Users. Any Bitcoin user can trade within the PMs, or create PMs, he/she just can't vote on the outcomes.


Yes you understand it perfectly. Consensus failure is treated as "The Author's Problem", where traders would lose at most half of their money (by thinking the market price is 1 when in reality it resets to half post-failure). Authors, however, lose all of their money, so one would expect them to strategically respond to this incentive by not ever creating a market that would be difficult to adjudicate. So in theory I've pushed this problem backwards through time to the point of its creation, which is all I could think to do.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:39:37


Not enough! I think a big part of advertising and media is about telling people what they want to hear, or just cheering for a certain group or value-system. I'm not sure they would influence, or be influenced by, PMs, for the same reasons that I dont really think CNBC is connected to financial markets.
My hope is certainly that, if media/advert put forth a contentious point of view, interested parties make and trade in a PM which clarifies the current state of knowledge about that point of view.

Say that with Bitcoin you need a draw a number 1-100,000 that is below, say 400 (to mine a block). With a centralized pool everyone draws until there is a winner, and the winner splits the winnings with the pool members. P2Pool says that you win a 'share' everytime you draw below 40,000. Eventually someone will draw a number that is both below 40,000 and below 400, and that person splits the winnings proportionally across all the shares since the last win.
P2Pool is not only decentralized, but trustless (pool operators can steal from their members without anyone really knowing) and cheaper (no fees). Its a great thing.

I'm a microeconomist, but extremely familiar with the leading macro schools, including Keynesian. They'll say:
1] The bank is loaning that money out to people who spend it (on consumer or capital goods, it doesn't matter ['Circular Flow']).
2] If the bank didn't loan that money out, you have the dreaded Liquidity Trap, and it IS just as bad, hence the need to resort to Fiscal Policy.
To understand Keynsianism, I imagine a few members of a firm becoming depressed during winter and taking antidepressants: it might not be pleasant or ideal, but it gets you through the winter, to work, etc. whereas the alternative is allegedly the entire firm altering its capital structure during the winter just to alter it back once winter's over. The inflation case essentially allows you to drug everyone against their will.
Frequently I hear 'True Keynsians' complain that the politicians used the wrong dosage or timing of antidepressant making the whole thing a waste of time.
It's hard to tell if many macro theories are falsifiable, in my opinion. People in micro make fun of macro all the time.

Check out my PM_Applications.pdf paper in the GitHub for more details on those claims. In the paper I describe, for example, an extremely specific 'global warming' market, with the idea that the price would essentially represent the probability that "global warming is true". If anyone disagreed with this (low or high) probability, all anyone would have to say would be "Well, if you really believe that I can make you a very rich man/woman."
You could also check the 'Academia_IdeaFutures.pdf' paper I put in the 'Further Reading' folder where leading PM scholar Robin Hanson describes the idea at great length.

Blocks contain a coinbase transaction which creates new coins. To get paid, miners set this to pay all to one address, their own, and because this transaction is included in a block this changes their block hashes. Part of Satoshi's genius is that, even if miners refused to include new transactions, or any transactions, they would all be working on a different problem, implying that a 51% pool would win only about 51% of the time, instead of nearly every time.
P2P just requires that, to earn shares, this coinbase address not be to one address but is instead to many.

As you say, despite overwhelming support from huge industries and superstar academics, PMs just can't get legal support in the US, primarily due to lack of awareness and anticompetitve lobbying from casinos. So it may be permanently illegal to participate in this in the United States, but (hopefully) I still have a free-speech right to author a theoretical paper. The code I'm writing is also just a clarification of the math, and does not involve Bitcoin.
Notice that I put a [PM_Applications.pdf]( paper in the docs folder which discusses the applications in greater detail, which answers many of your questions and will definitely give you a better idea of what I am thinking. I can try to summarize here, though.


These people will either avoid placing their money in a PM (which is exactly why PMs work), or they will be sitting ducks for those traders who do understand. If enough ignorant people enter a market it may be profitable for a firm to hire professional researchers to investigate the market's claim.
It's interesting you bring up that global warming example, as it is more or less exactly what I used in [PM_Applications.pdf](
Whistleblower creates a market on something surprising and slowly bets in favor of the surprise, uses leak to prove surprise = profit.


Multidimensional markets can estimate a marginal probability. Check [docs/PM_TypesAndUsage.pdf]( if you didn't already know this about PMs. 
Insurance: use a market where people cant sell (only redeem for 0 or 1) and bet for example $1,000 @ 1% that your 100,000 house WILL be destroyed by earthquake.
"Will BTC price index trade above 1000 on date X?" "Will MtGox reopen deposits before date X?" It is intermediate-level finance to replicate a portfolio of continuous assets using discrete options: you simply hold/borrow cash to equate the portfolio's returns. I was playing around with this in docs/Notes/ContinuousEstimation.xlsx but it may be difficult to follow.
Sadly, as you say, US consumers may be left with expensive, unfair, boring gambling. Perhaps when the example is set in other countries we can bring the benefits home.
TDAC: Bet against construction to finance. Multiple success states such that good-provider can uniquely win market and claim funds.
I don't intend to administer any of these things personally, and they are untested and theoretical. Nonetheless, I don't see why they wouldn't, in general, work (and I have been described as 'pessimistic').
I am really not qualified to scale the hurdles of implementation, as hopefully I made clear in the paper. However, after asking around, some developers made a number of helpful suggestions, such as a specialized Altcoin with this specific purpose, use of Etherium, Open Transactions, or complicated-SNARK-blockchain. Sadly these ideas do not directly involve Bitcoin (most of my Bitcoin-related ideas were identified as impractical by the experts I contacted), but I remain optimistic about this.

The cream of the crop has known about my project for some time (for example, vitalik and gwern identified themselves in here by name). I do not plan to auction the votecoins publicly on the internet, as that would be illegal and (in my opinion) unethical. I have no reason to misrepresent or even promote my project: What would I have to gain?
I also have no fewer than four degrees, two of them at the masters level from Case Western. At Yale I do research and have occasionally taught and attended classes. If you know anything about academia, you know that researchers outrank professors by much more than professors outrank students (even the hires/applicants ratio is lower than the undergrad-class-size/applicants ratio). Vitalik has not attended college, which makes no difference to me (or probably you) whatsover, so I am not sure what point you are trying to make. If you are claiming that I am fraudulently misrepresenting myself, I hope that you are writing from the United States, as my extended family includes many lawyers who like me very much.

Almost, but not quite. My favorite quality of a PM is that anyone who feels that they don't really have anything to contribute (even an expert), has an incentive to be quiet. The PM could even be driven entirely by the single most informed person. Check out my PM_misunderstandings.pdf for more, as I knew these issues would come up (because PMs are too often poorly explained, not the fault of any interest person such as yourself).
Typically, "talk is cheap" (and you get what you pay for), but PMs make talk expensive (and therefore relevant).

It was right up until here. What I had in mind is that I would say "document X existed at time T". Everyone would know document X, so they would also know SHA256(document X). They would take either the doc or the hash your site, and you would derive the associated bitcoin address by importprivkey(base58encode(hash)) and tell the user a] the timestamp of the block this was first embedded in, and possibly also b] the private, secure, BTC address that first sent to the file address (ie the bitcoin account of the document's author/owner). 


The only problem with this is that there are many types of seed, ie many different ways of going from SHA256 to Btc address, and it is highly desirable that everyone use the same standard method, for maximum simplicity and reproducibility. People will naturally converge to the simplest method over time, which is just to use the actual number created by sha256, only use this number in the base58 format that the Bitcoin software understands. Base58(Sha(Data)) is arguably simpler than importseed(Sha(Data))

The accepted way to do this is to:
1] Hash the data SHA256.
2] Use  to
 2a] Convert the hash to Base58Check
 2b] Import the Base58 as a private key
3] Send BTC to the given address AND BACK.
This process does not bloat the blockchain.
Note: after publishing the document, never again spend to the address in 3, as anyone with the document can spend those funds.
Optionally, sign a message from the wallet you used to send money to the address in 3, if anyone does not question the timing but claims it was they who published the data first.

*Major Spoilers:* 
Fake-donating that money to himself on his son's website (witout paying huge fees to Saul and his associates)
Laundering it through the car wash.
Preventing Skylar from giving it to the IRS cheat affair guy (and preventing Walt from using it to protect his family).
Keeping it in storage safely.
Counting it.
Mike moving around his hazard pay - and the lawyer dropping it off in a bank (causing problems for Walt when he is caught).
Giving it to Jesse.
Not having to worry about what Jesse does with it.
Moving it safely (without opening himself up to Jesse's bluff).
Ensuring it isn't stolen, and in fact ensuring that it sucessfully finds it's way to his children.
Even Hank when he helps Walt move, commenting on how heavy the bag is ("half million in cash").

The argument is that 1] Among currency users, CPUs will be 'much more distributed' than ASICs, and 2] LTC will always only be mined on the CPUs distributed among currency users. Obviously this argument is not convincing.
In fact, as scrypt 'costs more' (because of its additional memory requirements), in steady state (ie not today, where BTC dominates, but in a future where LTC and BTC compete), the barriers to entry for LTC mining would actually be higher and thus LTC would be more centralized.

You make a transaction giving all of your money away, but wont go through for t blocks (a year for example). Then, if you're still alive in six months, move your money to a new wallet and sign a new nLockTime transaction.

Some group will ALWAYS control 51% of the network, by definition. The issue is then 'will these people act in an extremely coordinated way to cause certain extremely specific things to happen'.
One or more mining pools could combine tomorrow with the goal of controlling a 51% hashrate, but they still have quite a bit of work ahead of them to, in a self-harming way, temporarily mess with the blockchain for the time that they are in control.

You should, you'd definitely get bitcointips from this crowd.
You should absolutely try to finish it close to the show's 'epic' finale in less than two weeks (!) to capitalize on the absurd quantity of free internet marketing you'd get out of sheet timing.

I dont really understand what you mean by 'legit'.
Some facts that may help:
1. To get the hash, you need the whole file.
2. In what I described, you do not check the file hash against the BTC address, you check the hash=private key.
3. It is easy to transform private keys into Bitcoin addresses, see brainwallet.org.
4. Hashes and private keys refer to huge numbers.
5. Although numbers can be equal, they have to be in the same units, hashes are usually hex and private keys are base58.
Hope that helped.

Probably, some Bitcoin users are both unaffected and not affected (ie they dont care one ...BIT about the situation).

Note: Clearly this won't work if the attacker permanently steals the transactions and private key/password for 1b, and then shoots you in the head before you can visit r/Bitcoin for more advice.
Then they'll just do what you were doing, pretending to be you.

Pruning methods have never been used, and so they are only theoretical. My understanding was that although regular users may one day get a much-smaller version of the blockchain, there would also be, somewhere, many hundred full nodes which would contain the entire Bitcoin transaction history and therefore the proof of existence.
Which is probably the best of both worlds.

Reminding everyone that NLockTime was designed for such purposes.
You build transactions that send to your heirs, but that cannot be spent for 1 year. If you are still alive in 364 days, move your money (this invalidates the LockTime transaction) and then make a new NLockTime transaction.

There will always be the need for a site that scans the blockchain for the BTC address defined by BtcAddress(ImportPrivKey(Base58(Sha256(Data)))).
The trick is standardizing the original process.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:35:07
The multisig idea is truly simple.
Hash the document and use the hash as a private key in a 1 of 2 transaction, spend it normally using the 'real' (non-document) private key and just send it to yourself.
Proof of Existence should also use this method, because non-tech people will not understand hashes, bitcoin, multisig, etc and have a hard time with this. You will want to get a jump on using the simplest method right NOW because eventually everyone will converge to one method and you really want it to be yours.

Haha that should be on that bitcoin onion site.
"last week the Bit Coin? is that how its pronounced(?) shot up to $788,000 and then **CRASHED** again over 50% to $375,000!"
"wow, 50% crash? thats crazy"
"Bitcoin crashed, huh? I wonder how the Winklevii are doing HAHAH"
"with that volatility we really wonder how long this is going to last"
"and...get this...it just shot up *again* this morning to 40 million and then FELL 85% $6,000,000"
"it is clearly not a currency for this reason"
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:19:11
Now there's the risk of it dropping to $11.

Any improvements would be re-copied back into Bitcoins. Altcoins only serve as software experiments, and cannot store any value. Any.

the OP_RETURN is great, but it will be confusing and impractical until standardized, hopefully with a 'publish' command in a GUI drop down or something. I tried halfheartedly to accomplish this and failed, maybe someone else will succeed, in the BitcoinOMG project or something perhaps.

Commentary about Mastercoin, positive or negative, aside, I felt that the meme-based-explanation was informative and accessible. 
Of course, I did already understand Bitcoin at the time, and I couldn't think of a soul I would share the link with because it was so strange.
This topic comes to mind:

Yes if someone could automate it so that it entrenched itself as the standard as early as possible, that would be fantastic and donation-worthy. Even if you just made a pull request modifying 'importprivkey' to accept files [as importprivkey(base58(sha256(data)))], you might immortalize yourself as a Bitcoin developer.
A core dev commented to me once that, actually 0 BTC spends can not be pruned, and actually dont do what people think they do (they dont go away, and instead also remain as bloat). The public notes could be blockchain.info
There is also the newly-allowed 'provably unspendable', but it also features a pointless irreversibility. I strongly believe what I outlined will eventually become the standard way, especially if micropayments continue to become more-nonstandard or are refused by miners.

I like this ^^ one the best. For Bitcoin specifically, I've used:
Public Key: Hotel room number (for you to slide cash underneath the door)
Private Key: My hotel key to open up that room (and get the cash)
To show that both keys are just pieces of information, integers in fact (in a world with a 2^160 room hotel, which would be just about one room per Earth-atom).

The original joke was [this](
In the talk, he describes a possible reality where your refrigerator checks the price of electricity for purchase with Bitcoin. The concept is that all Bitcoin transactions are treated equally, no matter who (or what) you are.

Here is [the original blockchain transaction]( When you click on each of the 3 output addresses, you can find the 
1Mz...,17P...,18o... input transaction in all 3, but will be unable to match the source with the destination (as you could with a normal transaction). Its as if 3 different threads got tied into a knot on this transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:09:44
I said it was technically true but misleading. Now I doubt your reading comprehension as well as your logic.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:50:20
Are you implying that regular users aren't 'specialized' enough to want/use a more user-friendly version of this feature? If you are, I disagree completely.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:24:49


While technically true, this is illogical and misleading. The "6 confirmations" is from Satoshi's Bitcoin Paper referring to a point after which is is infeasible to double-spend. Litecoin's confirmations are faster, but they are correspondingly weaker, so in fact 60 minutes is required either way.
All you get with Litecoin is more glimpses of the underlying safety of the transaction, and a faster first confirmation.

While this is true, it is actually not an advantage of 'LTC the currency'.
If scrypt proves to be more useful at preventing 51% attacks, the Bitcoin devs will fork BITCOIN to use scrypt. The same goes for the 2.5 minute interblock target.
The network effects have chosen BTC; the LTC of Nov 2013 is only an obscure experiment. LTC can not and will not store value.
