You get shot, but at least they probably won't know how to steal your bitcoins.

This is why people laugh at those who invest in BTC. Not because its risky or because it performing like ass right now, because its image is promoted by what looks like religious fanatics waving signs around. The reason we see Bitcoin listed on big financial websites is because all the VC money going and Wall St taking notice. Please for everyone else's sake treat Bitcoin as an investment, which is almost its only practical purpose so far.

You need to have at least 10k to make a decent arbitrage profit, since you can really only count on one trade loop per week with the long ass wire/money order times.

I don't think you can reliably withdraw USD. Even though they technically resumed withdrawals they still hold the wire transfer money for months in many cases. Supposedly because they are basically bankrupt from a 70mil fine, and the price increase is because its impossible to get money out. So I've heard...

I experienced my first fontas pump today. Did not work out as planned because he lied about the coin to pump on his twitter and everybody lost money. Was hoping to make $1000 in 5 minutes, lost $300 instead. Never again.

I just saw the price, and whoa. I'm pretty sure it just doubled. I'm buying a few in the small chance it becomes available on other exchanges and goes way up.

You can still buy again you know. I sold before the rise but I'm buying back now for the long term now. If global mainstream consumer adoption is the future than you stand to gain so much more than to lose.

I've never used Bitstamp but I've heard its good. My last deposit was wired to BTC-e and got there in 3 days. There are other alternatives like buying locally but the prices usually suck.

I'M SCARED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but holding

It worked for the past few months between BTC-E and Bitstamp but now everything is fucked up and the prices are backwards.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:52:00
Do NOT use Mtgox! The reason the price is so high is because it takes 8 weeks to withdraw funds, sometimes more. Also, Litecoin is only available at btc-e.com. I think Bitstamp and BTC-E are the typical choices for exchanges now that Gox is useless.

They trade them because they get scared or greedy. Holding is  the best strategy unless you have tons of experience day trading, and even then its a shitshow because of laggy exchanges and market manipulation. It's best to put them away and try not to obsess.

I wonder how long it would take for 10btc to be worth ONE MILLION DOLLARS
