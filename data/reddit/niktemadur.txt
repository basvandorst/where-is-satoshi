Just a personal, optimistic take on things, may be right or wrong, as follows:
A reason for the lack of adoption of the Segwit soft-fork mechanism so far has been short-term greed by miners, via fees, at the detriment of buyers and sellers, which has also created the horrifying transaction time situation.
With the market deflating and as those bottlenecks and fees become lower and lower, this particular, myopic benefit to miners is greatly reduced and they can start feeling at point-blank range how the economics of their resistance may be detrimental to them: short-term gains (now reduced) vs long-term sustainability.  Only via a pragmatic situation like this will the incentive to maintain the status quo diminish and they will finally consider adopting the existing scalability solutions.  Elements in the ecosystem correcting themselves in a changing environment.
For the moment, public image damage to Bitcoin is a real thing.  However, the amnesia is strong when Segwit and/or LN is implemented and there's another boost in the price so there's money to be made, you can just see the headlines everywhere going "Bitcoin is back, baby!  Now faster than ever!" - "How Bitcoin fixed its' problem and became stronger than ever before", etc.  
Might take two months or two years, who knows.  But Bitcoin ain't going away.

What Andreas has said over and over again, I paraphrase:  
People said that IPv4 would never be able handle the increasing volume of email... until it could.  
Then they said it could never handle audio streaming... until it could.  
Then they said it could never handle video streaming... until it could.
*(IPv6 was deployed around 2005, but with IPv4 so entrenched, even 12 years later it is still in the early stages of adoption)*
However, the road to the current Netflix world is paved with the carcasses of internet startups that were fairly successful in their day.  So what is the closest analogy to Bitcoin in this scenario - is it a Google, Yahoo, AOL or Altavista?

Because of the current limited economic resources of the Venezuelan people combined with Bitcoin's $10 fees and 6 hour transaction times, I would seriously imagine that a crypto with lower fees and faster transaction times would be more practical for buying necessities like food and water, soap and toilet paper, as Bitcoin right now looks more like an investment than the tradeable currency of Satoshi's vision.
Bitcoin right now looks better for buying a car or a house than buying daily goods.  
Something like Litecoin looks better for the Venezuelan peoples' current plight.

At the time, not bailing out the banks would have caused a deep worldwide depression, and we all would have suffered all the way to this day and beyond.  Although the bloodlust was justifiable, it simply wasn't worth it to satisfy it.  
Now that that's over and done with, yeah, fuck the banks and finally something is putting the fear of god into these smug pricks.  The important thing is that the mechanism now exists and is thriving.  It didn't exist back then.

An excellent point, I believe.  The ship of a nation might be "steady as she goes" under the policies of the Federal Reserve... if that was the only factor at play.  Unfortunately, on the one hand you have the perennially short-term "profit at any cost" mentality of corporate policies, as well as hysterical and ignorant masses led by demagogues who will gladly vote against their (and yours and mine) interests.  Then there's the whole political thing of insisting on being "the world's police", "nation building", for the benefit of the military industrial complex... what a mess.
As things stand, the inflexibility of the Federal Reserve's stances and policies end up being just one more corrosive element in the current corroded socioeconomic environment.

On the other, they do seem to simultaneously think mostly inside the box they inhabit and have difficulty zooming out to see the whole grand forest (case in point: the unimaginably large leap of scale from Harvard Connection to Facebook).  
Then what's up with the people they trust their code/keys with?  Again, their cozy formative surroundings may have limited the scope of people they have dealt with, particularly those who grew up hungry and achin' to be rich, their "born and raised rich" arrogance turning these people off, big time.
