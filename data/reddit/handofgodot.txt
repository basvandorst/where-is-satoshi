More bad news is good news, because capitalism!

It was only a matter of time before the ambulance-chasing began. Guess someone other than Mark Karpeles is going to make a few bucks out of this one ...

Yay! Do I have to hand over money in advance, hoping that my glittering law career will appreciate in spite of wildly fluctuating rates of exchange in human and economic capital?

"Studying bankruptcy*? Hell, take this crock of shit on and you'll doing a fucking ethnography on it. As I said above:

Uh ... no. But I have a really nice bridge to sell you ...

That number's a cheap hooker in Hoboken. Which is much the same as investing in Bitcoin or wasting your career trying to sue Mt. Gox, which *no longer fucking exists*, I guess.

And who would put him in jail? A horse-riding militia with tri-cornered tinfoil hats brandishing muskets?
Ooooohhhhh, no, sorry ... you want the gubmint to do that. Typical neoliberal: only want the state when you need it.

a) Someone's already thought of that, or something similar
b) It's a huge-ass scam

Are my fairies tax-deductible? Because I believe in them even if the IRS thinks I'm delusional. And I have, like, loads in the bottom of the garden.

Mt. Gox = legitimate business. Discuss.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:49:07
It's probably because the capitalist libertarians at Forbes got duped into investing in this huge-ass scam and are now trying to gee up the market.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:44:58
So, laws and the gubmint only work when it's working in your favor, right? Otherwise they cease to exist for all intents and purposes?
*sigh* ... lesson  on the "you can't argue against the bovine stupidity of libertarians" syllabus.

Mark Karpeles would have to follow his own wallet. Which, if it was in his back pocket, would cause him to spin perpetually.

Well, here's a quick way: pull an armed robbery on you local drug dealer, then flog the stash on Silk Road 2.
Note: YMMV.

IDFK. Raise a militia?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:24:17
Alrighty. Just remove the word "libertarian" from the above post, and replace it with "naive, foolish". The point holds just the same.

1. Regulatory failure and/or capture.
2. Regulatory failure and/or capture.
3. Regulatory failure and/or capture.
4. Regulatory failure and/or capture.
5. Guess what? Regulatory failure and/or capture.

No, he probably isn't. English verb tenses are way simpler than French verb tenses. More likely that English speakers screw up French verb tenses.

Sure. You'll be paid in 10,000 handsome Bitcoins once the whole stinking pile of horse-shit collapses in on itself, by which point a Bitcoin will be worth slightly less than $0.000001. Maybe you can think of a more productive way of spending your internship? I can.

"Pillars in the community"? It's a community, now, is it? Yesterday it was "Fuck you, goddamn socialist! I gotz mine!" individualism.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:11:27
Wait ... so does a lot of fucking whining about how Bitcoins shouldn't be taxed, and how evil the gubmint is, and [insert libertarian platitude here].
And now, when Mt.Gox has gone tits up, thanks to no regulation and libertarian gullibility regarding too-good-to-be-true ponzi schemes ... now, is offereing advice on how to deduct Mt.Gox losses from their gubmint tax returns!
Oh, my ... that's just *precious*.

Hey, libertarians: you got what you wished for. A free and unregulated market. Now quit with asking us taxpayers to bail you out. Remember (as someone wiser than me put it):
"In a 'Mad Max' world, it is overwhelmingly likely you will not be Mad Max. Rather, you'll be one of the skulls stacked in a pile by the side of the road."
