So was I before I learned about Bitcoin. Already we can see the relentless permeation into mainstream use daily. This is only possible because of its utility therefore its intrinsic value. 
If value is a result of the demand by the majority, then, when and not if Bitcoin goes mainstream gold will be relegated to an asset of lesser value behind Bitcoin. 
What then becomes of all the wealth currently held in gold?
Perhaps when the impact of Bitcoin hit the masses it will be quick and dramatic. Much faster than any of us could have anticipated.

I won't hold my breath for AliBaba to accept bitcoin. Their business model (middleman) would be disrupted by bitcoin success unless they buy Amazon. Open Bazaar would be the big disruptor for their business model. 
If I was using AliBaba's platform I will also have my same products on Open Bazaar as it would not cost me anything to duplicate the offering. When Open Bazaar platform matures I ditch AliBaba or similar type trading platforms. 
Alipay dropped bitcoin - that could be for political or compliance reasons. Of course they could also change their business model and go the way of Amazon in which case it will be in their interest to accept bitcoin. Will be a long wait...

More important than how many venues are accepting bitcoin is how many bitcoin ATMs are installed. 
For someone to spend bitcoin they must be able to buy it easily near the vendor and the vendor must offer a good discount for bitcoin purchases. 
If each ATM needs 100 coins to stock say, and we have 100,000 atms worldwide thats 10 million coins!! we only have 13 million now !! Guess what it will do to the price !!!

Lets examine that now. Possibly as much as 90% of the people in the world don't use gold as a store of value ( they just cant afford it and don' t have any). Yet sooner or later we know that bitcoin, similar or other crypto will play a part in everybody's lives. When that happens it becomes the currency and preferred store of value for the majority. 
Just think, it means that the existing elite and privilege looses a huge portion of their wealth. Maybe the greatest wealth distribution exercise of all time. 
Our existing system sends the wrong signals to the economy. It is absurd that huge profits are made in property meaning buy and hold and make capital gains - for doing nothing. That value increase could be utilised for real wealth creation. Real jobs!!
Investment in new jobs and enterprise is risky and most will fail but even when they fail they would have stimulated the economy and from their ashes other industries will arise. 
Bitcoin is the better system.

Deflation leads to less GDP growth maybe even negative. This means less tax revenue. However the interest on Goverment debt does not decrease and when you are sitting on 18 Trillion worth of debt it becomes a problem. The solution is to inflate away the problem but that is just kicking the can down the road sooner or later the deflation will set in or hyperinflation will occur. Either way the economy is set for a drastic correction. Trick is to be on the right side of the ledger when that occur. Owning bitcoin is a good hedge.

There will be two types of transactions. Normal and off-chain. The off-chain transactions will be the smart cards. These will not need computers or any knowledge to use. The bearer is the owner and you use it like cash(CC) maybe some biometric security. I am sure there are startups working on it. 
The thing to note is that bitcoin enterprises are automatically global. Successful companies will be globally huge. Once the economy is predominantly Bitcoin legal barriers just go away.
All this talk of volatility is nonsense. Bitcoin is "finding it's value". A business has 2 important consideration to use bitcoin. First if he can pay for his business inputs in bitcoin. And secondly if he can convert easily to fiat. 
As we can clearly see it is really hard to find something that we can't buy with bitcoin. This is at the retail level and if it begins to hold true at the B2B level then converting to fiat is not a priority or even neccessary.
When this point is reached then bitcoin has arrived mainstream and the economy is predominantly Bitcoin. I think that this will happen before the year is out.

Bitcoin is inflationary now, but you know the rate of inflation with certainty and it is decreasing over time. QE is arbitary and robs from the middle class and the poor and give it to the rich 10%. As a result you have runaway asset prices and stock prices which distorts the economy. An economic system that rewards someone for buying a house and sitting on it is wrong. What productive contribution did that person make just by buying a house and sitting on it for 5 - 7 years. We are robbing the future of our children and grandchildren.

Look at the Hashrate. Over 12 Petahash now. That's how wide the moat is. If some dedicated disruptor with deep pockets wants to attack the system the argument is that they are better off to use it to mine bitcoin. However if they are an "enemy" organisation or even a nation the computing resources are just not available. The fastest computers in the world calculates petaflops while bitcoin is hash. They are very different animals like a pick axe and a shovel. Not efficient in the alternate use. As for another coin, too much have been invested in the bitcoin ecospace that another coin even if better will find difficulty in gaining traction and will not have the "moat" to prevent attacks. From this point on I see only a coin that uses mining technology that bitcoin leaves behind such as Litecoin (GPUs) and other coins that builds on top of the Bitcoin architecture with specific properties that Bitcoin cannot incorporate easily.

Now that HTTP is  a network standard giving it value so much that it is priceless because it is owned by everybody like the crown jewels. Unlike HTTP you can own a part of the Bitcoin protocol even if it is just 1 satoshi (0.00000001) Bitcoin has intrinsic value because it has acquired the network effect and the greater the penetration the higher the value.

Bitcoin is electronic gold and they are stored in electronic wallets on the internet. Chinese companies like Asicminer and Bitmain are big producers of this new electronic gold. Like gold it is scarce and there will only ever be 21 million pieces of bitcoin, so over time it's value will increase. In one respect it is better than gold because it can be divided down to even 1 CNY and sent to other wallets over the internet at no cost. This makes it like money. This is the first international currency. People use it for tipping and buying things on the internet. Some governments try to ban bitcoins but they can't stop it's use because they cannot see who made the transactions. You can easily walk across borders worth millions of CNY because you carry the password in your head.

Don't have a crystal ball but confident the new system will develop and be more good than evil. 
Governments and Bureaucracy will get smaller, you wont get distortion of values into the stock and asset markets. As sure as night follow day, there will be a crash in the stock and real estate markets. This and it's consequences is built into our current system.

Bitcoin price will move with mining difficulty. The price will be such that mining will just provide reasonable returns. Possibly 20% return on investment max. Any variation outside of this will adjust up or down to the 'right' price. 
If prices are too high it means windfall profits for miners and the mining arms race is full on leading to escalation of the mining difficulty. Too low and miners will be decommission and technological development in mining slowed. 
With this in mind, it will be hard to see $1000 coin let alone $10,000 without mining difficulty following suite. 
At $200 CEX.IO and Bitmain are closed for mining. Asicminer and Genesis can still pay dividends. This means CEX and Bitmain will upgrade their hardware to keep their business model.

Chicken and egg. They both affect each other. Price equilibrium will be found then distorted by mining technology or bitcoin adoption then a new equilibrium. Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:35:46
When you know that there is no danger of a big buyer coming in then shorting is a safe strategy. There is a low point when those that are holding and believe in the technology start buying. It will just be the equilibrium point and this could be at $100. 
I think miners have no impact on the price. They are price takers and they will just have to adjust their mining to suit.
The situation will only change when the ETFs come in as they are the only people who will be willing to move the price upwards.
Meanwhile the best strategy is to let the price fall to 100 or as low as these short sellers wants it to go.

Fee markets is necessary or you get the situation like email spam. The thing is to decide on is what is a reasonable fee and the best way is to let the market decide. A variable blocksize (BU) allows the market to adjust and will also adjust for the second layer when it is available. Forcing the fee structure is not the solution. Those who disagree will exit.

Perception Adam. Perception. The perception is that Core comes across as "Know it all", "Get On or Fuck Off", group and supported with people with dictatorial traits and methods. That just does not engender trust with a large segment of our community. 
Another perception is that nothing is happening in Bitcoin, even if there is a huge amount going on behind the scenes.
Granted the perception is also that you guys are the smartest group of people working on Bitcoin.
Perhaps the best way to bring the community together is 2MB before Segwit. A worthy compromise on your Segwit before 2MB. At least it shows that something is happening and we are all pushing rather than pulling. Or we can all watch another crypto pass us by in the next few months.

If 80% of mining is done in China and they mostly use cheap power from over built hydro and solar facilities which would be wasted otherwise for no other uses in the vicinity. How do they do their calculations? They are accountants and I would expect that they would have provided a auditable basis for their calculations.

Bear in mind these are syndicates, so are well financed and professional. 
They target investors on the lookout for "inside information" usually provided by the brokers. The rumor is spread and the pump and dump starts. 
The resistance level before these the price spike today is about 262 USD. It is unlikely that any short sell will breach this level. More than likely today's price movement will have brought more people into the market so the price floor will be higher.

Yes I am saying that there will be a bailout. Condition for bailout was that Varoufakis ( Man with the Middle Finger ) exits, and he has. So there will be a bailout. Pressure from the US as well as they do not like what the uncertainty is doing to their markets. 
Once the Greeks especially the businessmen get access to their money again, they will make sure that this does not happen to them ever again. 
As a business you cant pay your overseas suppliers. Shipments sit on the docks because you are not allowed to pay your shippers with 'your own money' that you have 'sitting in the bank'. One option will be to move some of their money into bitcoin. 
If your write about this scenario years back they would think that you are hallucinating on some kind of powerful psychedelics. This is real. And it is the end result of our debt as money system. 
We have been fed the lie that it is the result of silly African and South American systems and policies. It will never happen to us. Not True. The end result is built into our monetary system. Greece brings it a little closer to home!!

As one who have dealt with many indian customers, one thing I noticed is that by nature they are always on the lookout for opportunities to save money and a bargain to a fault. It is not unusual  after striking an agreement to a discount and a closed deal, to be confronted with a request for another discount. This cultural trait, I think will make bitcoin irresistible to Indians, and a very big reason why bitcoin would go mainstream in India before anywhere else, starting with remittances then in everyday transactions.

Some people will object to its comparison as a stock. I think that it is a valid comparison. Imagine if bitcoin was a Google stock. How much would it be worth now?

Then you can buy stuff with it so it is also money. This thing is a GEKKO.

We will never live in deflationary economy. The banks will never allow that. Nearly all their asset backing is in real estate. This is basically what the majority of people borrow against, whether to buy property or to borrow for business etc. If property were to stagnate lending has to cease. If property price goes down the banks could become insolvent. They need the perpetual property bubble to exist.

Exactly. What you see now is a steady upwards with no flash crashes. (The one in August was a margin trading glitch on Bitfinex) This shows market tightening on the supply side. There are more entrants into the market everyday and they are holding. Don't forget for most people Bitcoin is hard to understand, harder to get hold of and even harder to spend. More people are overcoming this effort to benefit barrier each day.

Rise from 230 to 320 is approx 1 billion. Look at the Asian exchanges they all increase at the same time from nothing.

This is a scam. They troll the patent applications then invoice you for including you in the "world patent register". I bin all their letters.

Dont think the chinese will be letting up. May be preparing for possible capital controls by the government.

Preconfigured for solo mining so if you can reconfigure for pool mining how does it sits with 21 computer. Are we seeing a trend in Asic embedding in consumer devices? Perhaps our cars will have them soon to pay for parking etc.

It does look too good to be true. Great if it is real but I am quite skeptical.

Ponder this. Do you think China is going to sit by and watch Japan buy up all those coins mined in China? Watch for the reactions. 
Maybe if you take out the bot trading fudge numbers in China, Japan is already the largest market all because the Japanese Govt recognises bitcoin as money.
Other countries are not far behind.

Local Bitcoins is about real people buying for use or keep. Best metric for tracking adoption. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 10:42:40
Still only speculation. Something has changed.... Has there ever been  8 continuous days of rises before?
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:10:04
Not Likely.

Allow other in game coins like hyper etc and use shapeshift to convert between coins.

Thanks for pointing this out again. I think the whole community is very myopic and western centric. Indonesia is where real adoption is taking place at a very fast pace. There are 82,000 subscribers on bitcoin.co.id and growing at an accelerated rate. In terms of currency the indonesian rupiah is the fifth traded currency after China, USA, Euro and Japan. The trades on bitcoin.co.id are also small volume trades meaning there are lots of transaction making up the volume and no margin trading. Lets see how it progresses early next year.

Must be stop losses being triggered. Their trading engine cannot handle this amount of trading. Had a buy order at 389 but it did not activate until 398 then drop down to 387. Worse if you are caught the other way round - you close a short position at 400 and it did not trigger until 386.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:13:44
Dont think there will be any either as the chinese want to make the yuan international. However there are restrictions for individuals now. USD 50,000 per person. Maybe monitor this loose limit closer or place more restrictions.

Where have you been? Bitcoin will address both problems of remittances and capital controls. Even if they don't go ahead and implement it will be fertile grounds for bitcoin.

It is interesting to watch how quick the number of users grow. Also very impressed at how professional the site looks. Oscar knows his staff and people like him will take Indonesia to claim her rightful place as a leader of south east asian nation. Another sleeping giant awakes. This one on the back of bitcoin.

Yep. Kept thinking that someone will short the market from 236 up. Took profits 3 times to 281 and ended up having to buy back my position each time. There is no one brave enough to short the market these days. What a difference from 3 months to a year ago. I was caught buying into market pumps all the way down from 800.

You have not included wallets on exchanges. These usually contain some bitcoins.

It moves the interest away from them and give potential and existing adopters another option that is actually on the bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty may benefit and hold on possibly.
@_date: 2015-10-25 08:02:33
This bull wave seem different. A few new developments. Indonesian exchange mopping up 1000 coins a day. Gemini doing the same at 500 coins. Local Bitcoin volume is up and increasing and other smaller exchanges like Safello all net buyers. This price rise is a result of the tightening of the market on the supply side. Just means that when those who are afraid to miss out rush in the rise will be dramatic. It could well be a sustained bull wave all the way to 600 by Christmas. Wouldn't that be nice?
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:30:13
To manipulate the price you have to operate across several exchanges. I think that Coinbase does not allow these people to do so on the Coinbase exchange. So their short sell model no longer works.
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:38:58
There is this story about a shoemaker in Iran who found a market worldwide for his shoes after accepting bitcoin. What you have described is an opportunity. Get your businesses to accept bitcoin then offer to change it to local dinar for them.
@_date: 2015-02-08 02:06:42
Lets hope the chinese do not open up their markets too soon or start developing their own future bitcoin companies like Alibaba. Either of these events will change the status quo. - Anybody know of any bitcoin 2.0 developments in China?

At the moment it is the marginal cost of mining. Check out bitmain cloud mining and you can see that it is just profitable at these prices. Less efficient miners have shut down their operations. There will always be private miners who mines at a loss just to acquire and keep bitcoins. With the next increase in difficulty the price should move up. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:48:38
Bitsim may have the solution here. Can't wait for them to roll it out. Poor man's Trezor perhaps

Third outcome? Court will not want to rule on matter. Defer to individual country to apply fiscal policy.

If you have that much price differentials then the arbitrage profit is high. All you need is to move between exchanges and currencies. A chinese national living in US will find that easy. Maybe a company or trade on OKcoin US and OKcoin CNY. Someone will be making heaps now as long as this spread exist ( above cost of usd/cny exchange )

These people are clueless. They have just revealed what they are thinking and the real state of the economy. All the fast money (investment flows) will run for the hills, so to speak. Even if they retract the damage is done.

More like Chinese New Year Rally. Chinese are buying to give friends and family as "Ang Pows" Red Packets. Normally containing Fiat Money. Wonder how bitcoin is going to fit in that? 
Perhaps it is going to hit $300 by Wednesday. Chinese New Year Thursday on 19th. I will say this rally is all thanks to Coinbase keeping the market honest and true to Bitcoin potential.
This time the saying price will never be this low again will hold true.

How Soon? Gemini's volume is now 500 per day. Say they get to 2000 per day by end of November. Only 3000 coins mined per day. If these people are just traders than nothing changes. If hodlers then demand will exceed supply going forward.

I take it that you may be employed and if so you believe that after taking up the offer of employment, your employer have every right to change the terms and renumeration of your contract. I don't see much modernity in this way of thinking. Thank Satoshi there is bitcoin. It will make governments hornest.

Current prices are as low as it can get. Any lower and existing miners will not have any coins to sell as they will be out of business. Improvements in mining technology will change the dynamics. 
Similar situation with the gold bugs who are tearing their hair out confounded as to why price are not rising when the whole house of cards of fiat money is creaking and threatening to fall apart.

To clarify the point. Money is a social phenomenon. It is decided by the users in a social polity. No one person or organisation can control it. When something that is currently used as money looses to function as such WE (the users in the social network) will replace it with something else.

Krugman ask "Placing a floor on the value of bitcoins is… what, exactly?" From what I gather the intrinsic value of bitcoin comes from it's value as a protocol like FTP, SMTP, HTTP. You can't own any part of these but you can own part of the Bitcoin protocol. So how much is it worth?
