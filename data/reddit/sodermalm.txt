If you look at previous crashes, this crash is nothing. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:14
At least I can buy a cup of coffee with the worthless money :P
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:55:09
Today yes, but people argue that technological improvements will make it a currency tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:39:26
Lol they just want to sell the products belonging to the bank they are working for...
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:20:57
So you are not using Reddit?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:28:24
Dont worry I might buy a few coins if we reach $1
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:35:57
Sell 50% and then you are at least 50% correct! If it continues up you will make back some of the money and if it crashes (and you still believe in it) you can invest what you sold. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:45
Never catch a falling knife!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:36:08
Yeah it should be illegal for the price to fall! Kappa
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:44:29
Its not crashing - its falling with style!
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:51:54
Low? Bitcoin is worth 200 billion dollars and you can't even buy a coffee with it? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:00:20
Nope, I will buy all bitcoins I can HODL at $0.1
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:33:22
LOL why is the daily discussion thread always disappearing when the price crashes :S
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:59:40
True, it will CRASH below 7k
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:08:22
What a great idea to remove it, now everyone will go to 4chan and read FUD :D
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:45:46

It was below 6k in like february!
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:43:17
Everyone here sold at 17k :D

@_date: 2018-03-12 19:48:28
3k buy wall is our only hope!
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:55:58
Are you saying bitcoin will collapse today and stop existing?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:57:35

You better have your fun now because SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY inches closer!
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:24:35
Did you pay them back with your short position?
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:55:25
...and fiat is alive as in the last 1000 years! It was a fun experiment while it lasted...
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:27:07

@_date: 2018-03-24 22:16:40
And so it begins: Sunday Bloody Sunday :S
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:32:58
The Mtgox guy just woke up with a really bad hangover:
 goodbye $8000
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:58:08
The previous three crashes were even worse!
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:29:56
Malta is a volcano island - imagine what will happen if the servers are hit with melting lava???
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:23:34
Are you talking about bitcoin or your comment karma?
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:04:53
The question is if that happens before the hodlers run out of money?
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:21:44
True, it will crash so fast below 4500 that no-one can sell at that price!
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:40:04
RIP 8500 buy wall
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:16:04
But it's Black Monday!
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:58:46
Asia is eating breakfast and Europe is going to bed, so I think we all know whos selling: the home of the "brave"
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:24:14
More sellers than buyers!
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:06:53
The Mtgox guy is back from lunch!
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:14:25
The bottom is getting closer each day!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:52:13
One of the old crashes lasted 400 days, and this has lasted 40 days, so you have to hang in there! 
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:32:00
Hes guest guessing... no one knows!
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:30:37
Yes it will! Source: 4chan

@_date: 2018-11-19 19:13:15
Ive made a better comparison  with the 2011 crash included
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:50:25
In that case the opposite will happen!
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:19:56
The crash continues tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:05:01
No news, the crash to 3k continues as normal!
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:39:53
You will sell more if you rename it "Bitcoin Broken Dreams T-Shirt"
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:02:06
Just do the opposite!

@_date: 2018-03-01 11:28:15
So something worth 182 billion dollars is extremely under valued?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:35:16
I think you have misunderstood TA. TA is you use one combination of indicators that you have tested over time. You will get losses because of what you've mentioned but the profits will (hopefully) be greater than the losses. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:13:13
Yeah you can throw some of the mining equipment on the zombies!
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:47:57
The great crash to 3k started!
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:54:05
Keep it together!
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:14:59
Just a bug: 
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:49:36
Trump doesnt want US to help the world anymore, so the crash continues when US wakes up!
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:33:24
OMG it all makes sense. Jesus was born when bitcoin started to crash and he will die tomorrow
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:38:50
But its better to sell with a big loss than a catastrophic loss...
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:52:07
aaaaaaaaaaaaand goodbye 7k

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:13:08
Not anymore :S
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:41:22
I think the guy was talking about the market value...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:44:12
Lol selling stocks worth $1000 on the dow will not make a big difference...
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:45:49
It didnt work, the price is still crashing!
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:10:21

Don't worry, the crash continues tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:41:52
Yeah, selling with a catastrophic loss is better than an end-of-the-world-armageddon-loss!
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:32:14
Dont worry, the crash continues when the home of the "brave" wakes up!
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:24:57
Nope, there are still humans in the market!

I've updated my crash charts (comparing this crash with historical crashes): 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:56:37
The news has already been discounted into the price!
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:39:11

Talk to this guy:  Hes coding for commissions and is also into crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:46
Maybe a  but with a short summary of every coin so you dont have to spend weeks trying to figure out what they all do
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:39
But the pros here promised 50k this february?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:32:11
Keep it together!
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:37:17
No, the last bear market lasted 400 days and the other two lasted 90 days and 170 days
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:50:03
It has happened before and it wasnt the end: 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:31:10
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:12:40
No, bitcoin should be at USD ~1600 according to that chart
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:59:38
Are you implying the pro traders @ 4chan are wrong?

I've made a few charts comparing the crashes: 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:36:12
Trading bitcoin is like trading stocks, and if you are trading stocks a popular book series is Market Wizards. Theres also a good book called The Complete TurtleTrader, which was an experiment if you could give noobs a trading model and they could make money with no experience.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:56:46
The North Korea crisis is over so they will sell all their bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:56:32

@_date: 2018-03-17 20:44:24
But because of time differences theres not so much weekend
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:08:51
Ive updated my crash charts comparing this crash with previous crashes: 
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:54:10
Better than last weeks diarrhea! 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:19:36
The crash to 3000 has started!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:26:20
I read a book called Digital Gold which tells the history of Bitcoin, including previous crashes. If you haven't read it, it could be a good idea to pick it up instead of staring at the price. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:29:06
...and prepare to die in the end from torture!
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:17:42
What do you mean? It has already gone up thousands of percent?
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:24:23
Better comparison: 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:05:01
After a crash to 3k :P
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:39:06
If you zoom out you can also see theres a massive buy wall
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:38:00
RIP it was fun while it lasted! Now onwards to turtlecoins!
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:12:51

@_date: 2018-03-10 22:07:10

@_date: 2018-02-05 11:59:13
But a big loss is better than a catastrophic loss!
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:31:45
What if the guy who sat in the car was satoshi?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:30
You can see how much is traded by looking at the volume (the gray bars)
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:49:59
No, thats normal after a bubble! Fast raise = fast fall!
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:42:18
Sunday Bloody Sunday has started!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:12:26
We are officially out of hodlers!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:54:00
BUT a lot of people who trade are also losing money!
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:48:04
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:00:17
Now when everyone is positive here, the opposite will happen :P
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:44:15
Dont worry, the mtgox guy will soon go to work after the weekend!
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:25:59
Thats because the mods delete posts about the price :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:01:28
Nothing special, the collapse to 3k continues as normal
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:43:45
They are on my burger :P
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:23:17
Volume is low = ~~bear~~ bull trap :D
