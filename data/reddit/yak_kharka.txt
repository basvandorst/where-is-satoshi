The only transaction is actually the block reward. This happened because there were no new transaction to put on the block. You can see there was another block before him mere seconds before that processed a bit of transaction.

I had noticed for the second transaction, you had to enter the password but when you were purchasing farmbucks the password wasn't required. Was it because you had enter the password just a few seconds ago and isn't required again? How long is this timer? 
Extension runs smooth, great work.

Walmarts revenue was 500 billion in 2013. Math doesn't lie. Also regarding to costco, their profit mostly comes from membership. Most corporation in the retail business probably have a slim margin of 5 to 10%

You are already paying for it you just don't know it. Every store that accepts CC have already included cc fees to their cost. This is why some gas stations will offer petroleum for few cents cheaper if you pay by cash. Some even advertising this because its an incentive..

This news has no direct impact on their revenue, their revenue has steadily increased over the years. Probably because more people use cards than ever and there is no sign that its slowing. They have managed to expand globally and pretty much has the market under their will.. Remember plastic is fairly new, it only has room to grow. (Remember the S curve, almost all new businesses go through this) They are so powerful that they have convinced businesses all around US to pay employees with a debit card. (Win win for them, visa shares the fees collected with the company, charge for ATM withdrawls and merchant 3% fees, i personally belive that Visa and Mastercard are in it with the corps like AMZN and Walmart because AMZN and Walmart's cc fees are much lower compared to small businesses) **Bitcoin is the same, its new, its great and has great potential like Visa and Mastercard without all the fees and bank bullshits**

You don't get it bro. your story makes no sense. The merchants will know NOTHING about bitcoin and its infrastructure with this process and not to forget the fee's involved accepting Visa. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:09:44
This would be heaven even if I can reduce my cost of cc fees by 10%.

Anybody that replies with all cap LOL and only LOL is an idiot. Tell me what you found funny? If you find stock market complex than you probably think the same about bitcoins.

Dude Sally and Joe that run some sort of store aren't getting bitcoin in return for their goods, they will get USD via OP's company, the process will still have to go through the bank / institutions for Sally and Joe to get their money. Sally and Joe will never know anything about Bitcoin or its infrastructure with this process AND THEY ARE PAYING 3% TO VISA TO GET THE FIAT AND DON'T FORGET THE CONSUMER IS PAYING 1-2 Percent to get their bitcoin converted to dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:12:06
Dont wait for him to make a card, just use your CC thats already in your pockets. This is nothing new, you are just paying this guy 1-2% to use a card. Imagine buying a gift card but paying 1-2% more than what the card is worth.. yeah its not reasonable. Instead presuade merchants into accepting bitcoin, this will have a everlasting value because everybody with bitcoin can use it instead of few people who hold this card. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:50:08
I would love to start accepting bitcoin but its difficult having to use my mobile or a tablet to transact. A POS integrated with my ruby/gemstone pos would be fabulous.  As a convenience store owner I have noticed in increase of Credit Card usage and is eating my profit at the pump. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:53:04
I disagree, you are giving power back to the banks and corporations. Whole point of bitcoin was to eliminate the middle man not be integrated with with it. Guys your not getting BTC if you think it will explode due to these stupid implements. Your paying 2-3 percent to convert to fiat and the merchant is paying 3% to the banks to get your fiat. At the end 6% is lost to these crony assholes. That six percent will eventually come out of your pocket because of price increase on goods.

Most apps already do this already integrated with their wallets(blockchain app), key is to have more than the most used currencies so everybody can use it no matter what country you are in. I have been waiting for one that converts in Indian rupees and Nepali rupees so I can use it over here.

Individuals don't always hold on to their wealth but they will if it going to be worth more tomorrow. Most likely people will start using it when its stable. The more wealth everybody is aquring through this, the more people willing to buy merchandise. This would be better than exchanging it to fiat and paying taxes on it.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:22:26
But your not using your bitcoin, your paying OP to convert it to USD and using the card to pay the merchant. The merchant still has to go through the banks and wait for his money. The merchant will never know about what bitcoin is and what the infrastructure is like. The whole point of bitcoin from the beginning has been about being your own bank and not having to rely on 3rd party ever, with this card, there is still chance of fraud and not to mention the fee's. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:40:14
You might not be liable but society as a whole will be effected in the long-run. There is no such thing as free lunch. Either the merchant will have to eat the loss (usully they don't) or visa will have to. If merchants had to eat it, he/she would raise the price of goods to cover for fraudulent charges. If Visa had to eats the loss (usually they do) they will either charge merchants higher fees for the transaction or charge higher interest on CC. Right now Visa does both, so you can see Fradulent charge is their biggest overhead. Look it up, it eats up 40 fucking percent of their profits. To me thats a huge risk and **your a sad troll**
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:56:23
Amen brother, keep refuting these dumbasses who want to go back to credit cards. Why even bother with bitcoin than??? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:30:40
I'm sure convenience stores would love to take BTC, the credit card companies charge 3% on a card which is taking a big slice out of their profit. (Gas is low margin)

they aren't spending bitcoin BlueRavenGT, please get your head out of your ass. With this card, you can go to any store and purchase goods just like with a plastic in your wallet but you have to pay fees with this one. How is Bob ever going to know anything about bitcoin through this process, please explain this to me like i'm five. 
the consumer still has to tell BOB that hes actually paying with plastic that is funded with bitcoin, but the owner will never know any difference, the money will be taken out of your card (USD) and bob will receive an ACH in 3 business day in USD. Again bob will never know anything about bitcoin. 
 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:21:25
Exactly whole point of bitcoin was to be able to use it all around the world and not having to rely on these companies. Bitcoin is revolutionary because you can become your own bank, with this implement, the merchants will still have to rely on the crony banks. Damn it I hate all these wannabes. Nobody seems to get the picture now a days. Greed prevails :/

 How the hell you expect to remove such *institutions* when the merchants still have to rely on them to get your money. You don't get it bro, go back to basics or better yet just go use your damn credit card because this is nothing different here. Paying 1-2 percents to use your own money.
