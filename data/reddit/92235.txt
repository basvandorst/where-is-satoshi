Having the same problem, but from the US. I consider myself pretty internet savy, but the process to get these coins is pretty tough. From what I can tell you have to go through four companies to turn USD into bitcoins. You have the wallet such as MtGOX. Then you have a company that turns USD into bitcoins. I am trying bitinstant. Then you have a company that transfers the money to bitinstant which is ZipZap. Then you have to go to a Moneygram machine to deposit the money to ZipZap. Seems like a huge hassle. I think I will try it though and see what happens. I am getting raped on fees though. I think it will end up being 7%, but a $7 charge isn't bad for learning something new.

See, it is super complicated. I don't see how any average person would ever go through this... Makes me feel that this is more of people hoarding the bitcoins rather than using them as an actual currency.

So I just signed up for blockchain.info. I am trying to do the cash deposit, but it doesn't make sense. The instructions appear to be out of date. It looks like they use a service called bitinstant. It sounds like you are supposed to go through them to deposit at a location then they will send the bitcoins over to your wallet. When I go to bitinstant they don't have block chain listed as a receiver.

This has been my issue. If it is this hard to get money turned into Bitcoins how hard is it to get cash from Bitcoins?
