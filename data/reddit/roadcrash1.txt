I sent an email over to audenx he said let support get through their backlog of emails (about a weeks time) and see if the issue is resolved. Audenx (OP) had this issue on his radar and said to shoot him an email in a week if I get an answer or if I'm still waiting. I'll keep you posted as well. But definitely send bitfloor support an email.

It depends on the exchange you use, many of them offer better options for customers outside the US. But Bitfloor is based in the US so it catered to US customers.

My job began blocking Mt. Gox yesterday because it's flagged as a trading site...we're gaining legitimacy. Hold!

I just hope we can get some help.

It's just a frustrating experience when one of the easiest exchanges for U.S. users simply doesn't work.

I couldn't even get to that page. When that page finally loaded it was back up to $88.

Same here, the site was fine besides the buy section.

I lost my google authenticator token, is anyone else in the same boat? I've emailed and tweeted every bitfloor related account I could find.

Yeah I was aware, I submitted my withdrawal request around the middle of August. I'm still waiting.

I've tweeted them, tweeted Roman, and emailed 3 times.

I signed up but I was not a member of the bitcoin forum, so I have no ripples...what can I do now?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:17:23
when does this free period end?

I actually was able to get a coinbase order in last Saturday, but things like this frustrate me.

Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:18:45
I can give it a try! Thanks!

They seem to be doing a pretty good Cyprus impression...

Sorry to piggy back but lower in the thread we have myself and at least one other person who lost their google authenticator token, is there any way you could help me get in contact with someone who could help this get resolved so I could login?

Hopefully with this situation they'll give you an option to get bitcoin for that value and transfer it out. Or have a Good Samaritan in the US transfer it for you. Better trust them though! Need a volunteer?

Just pm'd you. Add another $132.
