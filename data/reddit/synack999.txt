Only 2 - I've searched the infographics in case anyone wants to check (see resume table near the bottom)
In any case, lets not loose focus - this discussion is going fringly on worstcase-edge-cases... what will be the "normal" on LN, is that once you have a channel open, you reuse it for months/years, for as long as you like :) zillions of transactions, very-small fees, streams of microtransactions - that has never been possible before to mankind :)

this is a "growing-phase" of bitcoin, and its good overall - the startup cias around crypto now have much more money to hire devs, and make bitcoin grow better: make easy-wallets, exchanges, etc. etc - integration with the "normal" world.
This is not "last-stop", this is one more phase of growth for bitcoin. 
If anyone didnt yet had a look into what is now coming in the next years, into bitcoin tech, they should pause a moment, and read - I leave a short selection for Taaki-minded-opinions: mimblewimble, lightning-network (notice the tor-like onion routing!), MAST, zero-knowledge-proofs, Schnorr-signatures... all these are high-privacy-features, which will allow for much better usage and safety of coins.
The future is bright, and not because of the price or the HODLing.
I'm very sure there is a very big group of people who would prefer to see bitcoin-price-very-low in exchange for bitcoin-usage-very-high :) But it seems its going to have both, and thats a good thing :)

look... I sense this "tendency" to only focus on "negative" views, which would make for an interesting discussion if they were not half-empty and purposely disguised around general-terms
I'll approach some of them just to try to avoid someone else to "fall in your traps"
- "isnt necessary wrong": the infographic is correct, compare with others . ?Why you try to cast a shadow of doubt?
- There is no "best-case example", its how it works, no more no less. Just see other explanations in youtube. ?Why again?
- "An on chain transaction is a cryptographic requirement". oh my, the solemnity of the phrase... and the emptiness of it... this really looks put here to mislead non-technical people to concede technical-authority to the other non-valid arguments (that curiously all detrict from LN). This brings nothing to the table, nothing at all but fancy wording :) This is the same for hubs and all other participants - 1 on-chain tx to initiate/setup channel and from then on, just good to go 
- "there are other techs that do payments much better" - please tell us about them!!! world-wide money transactions, without banks, in less-than-seconds, secure and pseudo-anonymous... its the *first* time in mankind! Bitcoin (and all these other crypto-innovations) work because for the first time in history, multiple mathematical problems that were unresolved for centuries, were solved by using internet distributed computing and cryptography. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies *are* nowadays the "renaissance movement" of applied crypto, which is frenzing all over the academic world... not a coincidence that bitcoin-core devs are so many PhD in mathematics and cryptography... This all to say that "there are not others" - this is the most bleeding edge and first-time existence of such technology. Gosh, as if everyday an einstein could appear and create a new relativaty-theory... (In fact, that is the real problem with the ICOs right now - they fool people into believing that anyone is an einstein, with a sofisticated-website and a "whitepaper" ... and all the bad reputation that then comes down on cryptocurrencies)
- "issues with stability and scalability of hubs": scalability issues is what LN solves, so this is not a concern at all. In any case, the LN work is not yet "deployment-ready" but people just want it so much right now that they are willing to use it on bticoin-mainnet (not wise... something bad will eventually happen to those) 
- "your infographic" - not mine :)
- "you cant refund ... trustlessly, you have to go through some trusted exchange" - not true also, you can refund with whoever is willing to transfer btc to you: an exchange, a service-payment, another person, etc...
boy oh boy...

This is not correct - see any of the infographics posted in last days about lightning, they explain it
The idea is not to open-and-close one channel for each transaction between 2 participants, but to have that same channel "always" open and reuse it indefinetely - recharging it is also possible inside lightning.

Reading the intentions of Requeddit, it came to my mind a fascinating idea towards **independent online book writters**: a "Joystream" where an independent writer could distribute-and-sell-by-the-page its story
* it would allow for the writter to distribute the book
* and also to measure the profit/success of the book as it is being written (as tv series do: if initial episodes have enough audience, they keep funding future episodes)
* eventually add some feedback option for the fans (voting for characters, or for history-developments)
Do you remember all those people that get up at strange hours in the morning to see the final episode of some favourite tv-series? Well, imagine it with a good book (which may even be a real-life story unfolding in real-time...)
What do you guys think? 
Is there any library to ease the implementation of payment-channels for non-genius-developers like me?
PS: I've created a [thread]( on to see what usefullness would this really have from a writers perspective

Nice to know it exists a similar in China :)
It seems to already exist a pay-per-chapter named [Kindle Serie]( certainly focused on the north-american market

Let me present you with a simple smartcontract example which is easily feasible in the future and just came out of my head - the *BitcoinLotery*, introducing some novelties over traditional lottery, such as:
* you can buy your "lottery-ticket" through the internet
* lottery is sold at worldwide global scale, as the internet; anyone can play, all countries
* no max-cap on prizes: *all* money in is distributed as prizes
* mathematical *garantee* that all the week-money-prize will *always be distributed* to a *fixed-number-of-winners* where each earns an established-% of the week-money-prize. This means no-jackpots, and no-more-zero-winners. 
* easy verification of the pick of the winners by using some  randomness-agreement (ex: hash(last-10-blocks-hashes)) 
* immediate payment of the prize to all the winners, worldwide,  instantly
This is all easy to implement in future smart-contracts

TL;DR: low-quality post, disinformation. LN is good news to everyone who likes a *very-cheap-and-super-fast-transaction-network*. Post critics dont make sense,  author does not understand bitcoin nor Lightning Network. Try to uncover the misinformation in the post.
The post is so low-quality that I feel compeled to reply to all the other readers, in order to try to clarify some ilusions and misinformation that was presented. 
The original author was clearly compelled by emotional impulse, and not rational analysis of the arguments.


why? or why not? to criticize this point, it would be necessary to explain and consider the minimum criteria that defines a *good solution*. Core has its criteria and have it explained in the internets (search), Classic has different criteria (idem). This critic dont show any criteria, just emotional screaming.
Always was and still is a central characteristic of it - many core devs fight for it maintaining that special quality
Idem, was and still is
Also, Lightning Network is being developed on top of cryptographic engineering, to keep the zero-trust along the LN transactions. The author never read the original LN paperm it was one of the interesting discoveries: to make bitcoin transaction off-blockchain, using intermediaries in a trustless manner. Really, this serves to shows how little technical background the author had... 


Fees always existed, from where they were 0 to now to ever. Its written as a feature of the bitcoin transaction system, has its importance both to spam, miners and users. Its in the original bitcoin paper!


Bitcoin was not intended to be sold-up: all the people around it gathered by its interest in the possibilities that bitcoin introduced.
If anyone *sells* bitcoin to you, you should be suspicious. Dont go near bitcoin if you dont understand it, its still too young and growing very fast...  Not even ready for massive adoption - that will inevitably come in 5-10 years.
 


Oh my, now this is not a minor technical glitch, this is blunt lie. He does not know what LN is, and what an "altcoin" is, and what a "digital currency" is. This has no discussion, LN and "digital currency" have no relation whatsoever. LN is like passing very-fast-transactions-between peers, its not about creating a new digital currency. 
In case its not clear, Lightning network will move-very-fast-bitcoin-transaction, not an altcoin or a new digital currency, or a new side-chain. Oh my, I just hope people dont get fooled by the disinformation posted...


Really, lets go slower: LN is not disconnected from blockchain, it uses blockchain state to operate, but with minimum interference (open/close channels and even that has been optimized!)
Requiring trust, centralizing payments - as stated before, LN presents a way to use intermediaries with LN in a trustless way (meaning you dont need to trust your peers, as much as nodes in the bitcion network also dont need to trust other nodes in bitcoin network - its all cryptographically secured, and that one of the great discoveries made possible with LN)
creating fees ... middle-men bitcoin was trying to escape - bitcoin did not try to escape from anything, it was made to be resistant to bad-actors, and succeded. That the biggest win. About the fees, if it was understood by the author what LN is and how it will operate and how it will impact in bitcoin transactions, it would be clear that LN will have much lower fees than the bitcoin blockfchain (whatever those are). So LN is good news to everyone who likes a very-cheap-and-super-fast-transaction-network. LN allows microtransactions (transaction with very low (micro-)value, made possible by using even-smaller-very-very-low-micro-fees ).


Bitcoin is going in the same path since the beginning and accelerating now more than ever: internet wide transactions, securely registered in few hours, no central-control, no user-identification, open network participation, its all there as it was since the beginning, with many more eyes and good devs working for it...
Future improvements in the pipe for bitcoin: segregated witness (increased block-size, new development lines toward smartcontracts extensability, maleability fixes, soft-forkable, etc, etc... its so many good things together that it almost seems untrue), IBLT (reduce network bandwidth), LN (lightning-fast-transactions), side-chains (a whole new universe with permition to create), etc... 
For bitcoin-technical-geeks, this post is a red flag after another red flag... there is too little knowledge of the subject to make a critic and a lot of misinformation... the kind of things that ultimately give reddit a bad reputation...  
PD: I'm no expert, but know enough to see this is all misinformation.

3K€ is already a real limit in Spain, since a few years ago, for direct-money transactions. Government said it was a measure to control corruption and black-money... However I tend to think corruption and black-money already have their own ways within the banking/financial system (finantial paradises, conseling, etc)

It may be seen like this: 
  * *without* discard-lower-fees, you should wait 6 blocks to consider your transaction as confirmed. 
  * *with* discard-lower-fees, you should wait Y + 6 blocks to consider your transaction as confirmed. 
  *   * In _normal conditions_ you will pay an average-fee which will include your transaction in the next block, so in normal conditions Y=1. 
  *   * In _abnormal conditions_, like when there is a flood-of-high-fee-transactions, then your calculated average-fee may not be enough to include your transaction in the next block, and may delay the confirmation of your transaction until you increase the fee or until the transaction-flood recedes, so Y &gt; 1. This case is only transitory until the fee reaches its new average (be it at a higher level or at same level as before)
So overall this seems to improve transaction operations under normal conditions, and not aggravate transactions in  abnormal conditions

You can install VirtualBox in windows, and then create a virtual machine with linux, where you can make your tests. VirtualBox even allows to share folders between the linux-guest and your windows-host, and connect from linux-guest to the internet through windows-host. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:56:18


Now you could make it work in linux again, by using a linux virtual machine.


Surely the definitive windows version will be compiled and made available by the devs for general download in a near future.
@_date: 2015-10-22 19:34:41
You seem to insist towards the extreme of the most negative possibility... not saying that. 
In abnormal conditions - which is only a transitory state - if you have a hurry to confirm your transaction you can do so by increasing its fee. So its transitory and you have an option to overcome it if you need it.

Are you a  bitcoin dev?
Can you claim any legitimacy in technical knowledge of bitcoin development?
Do you even see what Lightning Network is becoming?
Its soo easy talking in reddit, isnt it? Makes it sound like anyone is an expert, with the right choice of words...
@_date: 2016-05-23 20:54:29
Oh no, here it goes again, the hocus pokus and flame wars that shine notoriety to some, and distract others from legitimate work...

I'm not an investor, and I can see that technically bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency in the moment (even from ether!) that has grew to such dimensions in network size, that faces engineering problems never before encountered by *any* other cryptocurrency, and in those moments it becames more visible that the community of developers supporting bitcoin is world-class-phdLevel-talented-crypto-engineers who discuss fiercely every problem and possible solutions, and then implement it with extreme rigor of code/economic/network.
Also have in mind that the size of the network is what gives security to the network (the more miners, the more secure), so having the largest netwkork means having the most secure network of all cryptocurrencies.
The size of the bitcoin network, plus that top-notch-tallented-community is something no other cryptocurrency has yet matched nor even came close to comparison... bitcoin is just the most secured cryptocurrency there is now, by network size and technical quality.
So **public credibility** or **trust** were never the pilars of bitcoin, much the contrary: bitcoin was made from start to work in a way that makes it immune to credibility or trust from the users - it's all cryptography which does not need **trust** or **credibility**, its as secure and trustefull as proven mathematics (of crypto)
