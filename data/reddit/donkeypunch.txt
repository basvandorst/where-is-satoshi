You can stop worrying about this. You won't become a millionaire. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:12:58


Like pretty much everyone here?
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:52:29
Nice clickbait. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:35:21
Yes? Just like any sane person would. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:26:39
Is this your other nick?
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:06:59
I don't come here to read christian propaganda from a religious nutter. Post your bs somewhere else. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:45:18
Obviously. Most is fake. But this sub doesn't like to talk about it for some reason. 
And downvoted in seconds. Of course. 
This place...
"We really, reaaaally hate censorship but i'm gonna downvote everything i don't agree with". 
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:21:34
1: He didn't mention where he's from so it's impossible to answer. 
2: Even if we know where he's from it's too situation specific to help him. 
3: You should never ever take advice on important financial stuff from some anons on Reddit. Especially this sub.
My answer is the best answer he can get. He should not get his advice here but from a tax expert in his area. 
But yeah, go ahead and downvote me because you can't handle someone posting on a public forum.

I understand you're new to bitcoin but this applies to all markets in general. Why do you think anybody here can predict the price in the future?
If someone could wouldn't you think they're too busy making millions instead of making you rich?
And also i thought it was all about the technology. 1btc = 1btc?
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:23:06


How do you know?
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:08:53
What does that have to do with me?
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:17:11
You seriously expect someone here to be able to answer that? C'mon. 
And downvoted within seconds. What is it with the place and the insane downvoting that's going on here?
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:48:24
Any specific reason why you didn't use the search?
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:22:33
No. 
Edit: "we really, really hate censorship in this sub! Omg guyz, someone said something we don't agree with! Downvote the shit out of him!!1"
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:36:28
Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:46:30
Jesus Christ. You "investigated" a site that claims to double your coins?
What's next? You're gonna investigate a Nigerian prince?
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:56:49


You are new to this whole internet thing, aren't you?
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:06:20
Why exactly?
Edit - so i get downvoted for asking why? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:29:23
Or most likely a bitcoiner making things up. Which happens quite often here. But that isn't a possibility for you?
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:06:28
Translation: i am 16, own half a coin and want to get rich without working. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:32:15
This is somehow Bitcoin related?
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:31:52
Yes. Bitcoin companies. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:18:56


Yet that's exactly what he did. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 06:07:23
Are you stoned or something? Or just really, really slow?
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:02:44
Do you realize the world isn't 1 country?
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:15:40
Wtf?
