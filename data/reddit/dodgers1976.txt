Because now I have 100 bits less than what I would have if I had transferred in smaller amounts I guess)

Also, there's a part 1 which discusses the 'advantages' of investing in bitcoin: 
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:50:43
I was just reading the following article:  it states: "if the bitcoin chart does what it did during a similar (but smaller) previous correction, then $390 (Bitstamp) and 2300 CNY the 100MA could be the eventual target". I'm no expert, though.

Congratulations! I had a goal of getting 1BTC by the end of 2015 and I'm almost there) I think it will take me a while to get 16! I'm not sure of any places to invest, but I think my plan will be to sit on it/them. If you do invest then I wish you luck in getting your house)

Argh! Making my bed!!! I knew I'd forgotten to add something to my list! )
I've not heard of Habit List but it looks quite interesting.

I always have a to-do list, but the biggest problem is that your list can very quickly fill up to the point where you have too many things to do. Therefore I find prioritising items on my to-do list helps me accomplish my tasks more efficiently (easier said than done).
I've experimented with many to-do list apps, some are better than others. I've recently started looking at the Getting Things Done (GTD) system to see if it will help with my productivity. Their web app is quite useful and has helped with prioritising my tasks. 
I'll be trying these principles for the next few months to see if it improves my productivity.

Are there any good counter-arguments? I would be interested in reading both sides.
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:41:05
That's one of my biggest issues, I don't get out of my head what I need to do. If you don't have your to-do list full of all your tasks then it's impossible to prioritise because something else you forgot about always pops up!

Merry Christmas to everyone)
New user to Reddit, joined purely to find out about bitcoin, and this was the first thread I came across!
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:24:10
So far I've only lost 100 bits, and that was from the first time I transferred from one wallet to another and didn't realise there was a "Bitcoin network fee") I'm sure I'll make a few more mistakes along the way!
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:56:29
I'm from the UK and I used CoinFloor. I had to verify my account, but once done it was straight forward to purchase what I needed. They have brokers that can offer BTC for prices ranging from £20 - £10,000, although I'm sure you could buy more. Depending on how much you wish to purchase, it might be worth having a chat with some of the brokers to see what they can offer.

Well you just saved me from potentially loosing more bits from doing smaller transactions instead of doing a bigger transaction. Thank you good sir.
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:07:59
That's what I thought. I'm new to Bitcoin and I'm sure there are many others too that can be easily swayed by such articles, so it would be good to hear the opinions of the people here)
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:33:32
Thank you for taking the time to break down each point with your views. This might be a recap for regular readers here, but for newcomers like myself it has proved extremely useful. You've restored my confidence once again)
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:48:27
Thank you very much! It's great to see how this new cryptocurrency works and integrates with websites so easily. This is something I'll look forward to researching in more detail in 2016. Thanks again!

I fall into the less experienced bracket of people then because I've only been researching Bitcoin for the last month. My first wallet was Luxstack but I've also got Bread Wallet and Coinbase. It was through my first wallet transfer (Luxstack to Bread) when I noticed the bitcoin network fee, something I was not aware of as I'd never done a transfer before.
I've not carried out another transfer since so I'm still uncertain about all the fees until I do more research into Bitcoin. What you said makes a lot more sense to me now, though. I'll be sure to check the wallet's transaction page before carrying out the process next time. Thanks again.

So you don't have any examples then?
