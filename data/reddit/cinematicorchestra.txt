Would you elaborate?

Then it's completely unfit for purpose.
If it cannot be used as a currency in any practical sense, i.e. to trade for goods or services, then how should it affect the value? How long a lifespan does a currency have if it can't be used to buy anything with?

Good to know, thanks!

[How divisible are bitcoins?](
A bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction. If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.
If 1 BTC = $10,000, then...
* 0.5 BTC = $5,000
* 0.1 BTC = $1,000
* 0.01 BTC = $100
* 0.001 BTC = $10
* 0.00000001 BTC = $0.0001 (i.e. one hundredth of one cent)

A typical transaction is ~250 bytes, and fees are charged at a certain amount per byte.
A website like [this]( helps you determine what fee you should set.
At the time of writing it recommends 200 Satoshi's per byte, which is equivalent to 0.0000020 BTC
The lower your fee, the longer it might possibly take to be picked up by a miner and added to the next block. The higher the fee, the more likely a miner is to add that transaction to their next block. So you have to balance a couple factors: underpay and your transaction will remain unconfirmed for a long-ish time; overpay, and even though your transaction is confirmed quickly, there exists the possibility you could have set a lower fee and been confirmed in the same, or similar, length of time.
