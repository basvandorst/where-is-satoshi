Human nature -- people value what they pay for. Value exchange works. Otherwise, they don't see it as valuable.

He doesn't require using ChangeTip.  Read below.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:26:52
Confirmed. You can expect a blog post shortly. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:29:54
Hopefully that will never happen.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:29:28
Choice is always there to do what you please.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:22:39
We don't sell user data. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:27:15
ChangeTip is a company and as such, complies with the law. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:23:12
We don't sell user data.  
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:09:59
Depends on the charity, depends on the artist ;)
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:18:10
This is stated on the site.
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:28:10
Abra is so rad.  Definitely my fave. start up atm.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:29:17
Thanks for the kind words, Theymos.  We do work hard to provide value to the community. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:20:13
The fee won't immediately take effect tomorrow, it will instead be phased in over the next two weeks. You can expect a blog post on this shortly.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:36:21
Thanks, we do try. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:07:10
That's the hard part. I want to give bitcoin to everyone so they can understand how to use it, but then it's like, why would I give away something so valuable? :\
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:10:17
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:16:52
Livestreamed it yesterday - here's the link:
Quality isn't the greatest, but was streamed over Meerkat.  The coolest part? We had over 1000 peeps stop in, and about 130 people tuned in by the end of it.  It was awesome to see/watch and props to the whole team for all your work :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:57:06
I though the point was circumventing third parties like banks, not strengthening them. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:28:23
Clever name. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:13:42
I appreciate your interest in ChangeTip and our blog schedule. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:48:28
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:07:50
So sorry to see this, Adam.  And of course this is not okay.  Can you sue?
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:28:30
Good question. Why not reach the charity themselves and ask?
Best to go directly to the source.
@_date: 2015-06-26 00:21:21
Yeah we met them and bought coffees from them while in BA, too. :)
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:30:29
Yeah, that sucks.  You could post the YouTube links to Tipworthy, however. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:23:33
Thanks for using the service...
@_date: 2014-04-12 03:24:23
It's not - I'm just keeping you guys posted on what's going on in Canada.  Read other posts in reddit to learn more. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:02:53
There is no need to panic.  Remember why you're in this and understand how markets work.  If anything, you should be buying. IMHO. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:52:12
Well, thank you! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:54:05

@_date: 2015-05-03 05:17:39
This is cool. What is it about Bitcoin that you like? 
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:57:40
Yep, so it's not the experience we would hope (as mentioned in our blog and release) but it's the best we can do given the limitations.  You have to use it from within our platform ATM!
Anything else I can help w?
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:57:19
noted. good feedback @_date: 2015-01-13 17:54:08
Yes ^
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:11:14
I think there's a difference between positivity and delusion.  I think people are positive. 
Scams happen everywhere, and happen far more often in the currency we call the USD.  Not saying they aren't in Bitcoin.  They are.  I consider these growing pains.... and impetus to level up as a community. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:33:23
Seriously. I had major difficulties shopping online tonight. 
"Bitcoin is easier! Bitcoin is easier!!!!"
It's made for the Internet. We need more of that. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:34:10
Lots! And if you have any feature requests, feedback, etc...
just let me know.  Victoria -- or over Reddit, of course :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:01:59
I love seeing this :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:57:38
You are so awesome.  I love the positivity. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:52:16
I'll bring this to the team - thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:53:07
This is so awesome. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:31:52
Happy to help!
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:28:09
Oh my gosh. You're amazing. 
How did you get into Bitcoin? I would love to chat with you and write about you.  This is so cool. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:18:11
Yep - and it's so easy to get paid in bitcoin.  So quick, basically no fees.  Loves it
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:57:01
Welcome!  if you want to connect/ever want to chat/give feedback/ask questions, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:33:38
First tip? Wow! Welcome. I think you'll love it. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:53:24
Gotta do it from within the platform.  Sorry mates.  We're working on it, but Facebook is quite limiting. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:26:58
I would personally like to add a job board to our platform. I earned 99% of my bitcoin and there's a real need and value transfer there. Stay tuned 
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:52:46
Ways to monitor balance? Sorry PenultimateOne, we have SO much going on - thanks for the gentle nudge and reminder :)
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:15:33
Earn it
@_date: 2015-01-07 07:30:11
You rock. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:31:58
Sad to see you go. 
Wish you would stay. 
It's funny, but reading things like this make me feel very protective. 
I still love Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:33:20
Thanks everyone :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:54:41
It's unfortunate because then we have the other side, where people fall hook, line and sinker without any due diligence whatsoever.  
Fear and greed are powerful motivators
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:55:57
It's cool, it's fun, it's moving value around social media, and I can think of 10 blog posts, or even 20 that you could tip.  I used to receive tips for writing, and even though they were small amounts ($.05) -- a) they add up and b) it was a nice gesture, and made me feel good. 
When the like button isn't enough...
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:31:07
Awesome to see.  Welcome. I don't have the answer but can share with others :)
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:44:00
Indeed. This time, we spent time planning a partnership campaign to involve them and educate more of their team and donor base on Bitcoin, which is pretty exciting. Also got them some mainstream press in Forbes. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:17:36
That would be cool to see! Let me know if I can help... 
I'd love to get more action on reddit for donations for them - that's how they started out! 
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:44:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:38:53
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:54:20
ChangeTip is synced with LibraTax for this purpose, and I believe bitpay offer this, as well. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:05:09
I love how fearless you are.  More of this, please. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:53:56
Thanks for this information! Great resource.  One hug @_date: 2015-04-01 17:44:56
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:30:15
Nice work!
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:21:05
Can't escape, or don't want to escape? I still see people excited when banks notice or comment on Bitcoin.  Not exactly the point, is it?
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:11:44
or tip them on twitter... changetip account open. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:19:09
Totally agreed. Cool story to hear; thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:12:46
Would be interested in speaking with you about partnering up for future campaigns. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:57:54
Nice message. Hello! 
@_date: 2015-11-18 02:51:52
Victoria here. I work with ChangeTip.
First off, I want to thank you all for your attention, care and interest in ChangeTip.
Second, I want to thank you for understanding that there is no mention of any currency on the ChangeTip logged out home page. In fact, currency is only mentioned in our white board video.
Third, ChangeTip is about the transfer of appreciation and value and the exploration into the possibilities that micropayments hold.  We see bitcoin as the solution for many, many problems we see in our current online experience.  Like frictionless payments, connecting p2p, and ads...  
Fourth, when you log into your account, you will see mentions of bitcoin. We have dual pockets to support the choice of bitcoin or USD. I encourage you to try tipping in bitcoin... it may assuage your fears that we are removing it from the functionality of our site.
In sum... ChangeTip embraces bitcoin, and now allows USD users to be exposed to it and experience it in a safe place. They can even transfer bitcoin to USD and vice versa to try it out. 
IMO, I feel we as a community have much larger work to do than sit around discussing copy on a webpage.  Bitcoin will not grow because it is mentioned on a website. It will grow because of us using it, talking to people about it, and teaching people how to use it. I have personally onboarded more people into the overall ecosystem via ChangeTip than via any other product or platform I have come across (Fold is rad, too!) and that fact is why I chose to work almost exclusively with this company and continue to work on this product. 
I appreciate the concern and feedback. Please understand that I try to reach out to every new user we onboard, and invite them into our robust community where they can safely learn the benefits and differences of bitcoin. We are still the easiest way to introduce people to bitcoin, and that's not changing anytime soon.  Now, we just offer people who are petrified of bitcoin a safe, supportive place to experience it.
And if you don't believe me, ask any member of our community who were once non-Bitcoiners and who now almost use exclusively bitcoin :simple_smile: Just ask Osiris or StringStory ;)
If you have further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to come to me.
V.	
P.S. If you want to join our Slack community for a deeper understanding of what we're up to and how we feel about bitcoin, just DM me your e-mail address and I'll invite you in.

How the banks sell products:
Save money
Save time
Earn money
Ease (I think, is the last one)
Sell the benefits, not the features.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:15:17
:) You deserved it!
@_date: 2015-10-04 01:30:25
Thanks for taking this stance. I completely agree with you, and it's why we work so hard to build tools like this.  Love the positivity here.  Thank you!

Interesting - so you wouldn't want to see stores add their products or list themselves, or even the option to buy gift cards, etc?
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:09:31
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:57:53
Sweet.  Welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, just hmu. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:56:51
Hello! How are you?
Thanks for passing this along -- what improvements do you recommend for this?
Thanks again,
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:58:13
Nice of you to guide :)
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:24:26
Ok.  I can answer here --&gt; Yes.  They were built to deliver tips to and from people who use the service :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:58:31






Good feedback - we will make this better for you. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:11:53
Great.  Thank you for the clarification!
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:37:18
^Feel free to re-ask but I just answered in your thread. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:52:17
Sweet! That's awesome! Thank you! @_date: 2015-02-04 18:14:36
YES.  We do!
Can you get in touch? I would love to hear more about this person.  victoria or any form of DM, really :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:58:33
It's not in Grand Cayman. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:59:10
I heard this, too.
