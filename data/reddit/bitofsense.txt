 &gt;If price doubles every halving
Ignorance is truly bliss. If the price just magically doubles we'll never have to face reality. Let's all cross our fingers that somehow bitcoin transactions are subsidized forever, right?  
The price isn't going to keep doubling. Many people are buying in anticipation of the halving, the same buying pressure won't exist afterwards, especially so once the music stops and people like you realize these doublings aren't realistic and eventually you'll be faced with $2-5 transaction fees for your Bitcoin purchases.

Been reading this for months now, no change in sight. Keep on believin', slugger - the change you're looking for is nowhere in sight and already months too late. The private blockchain genie is out of the bag. Meanwhile, multiple companies have already dismissed using Bitcoin's shitty blockchain in favor of a customized, private one. No wonder why.


I posted an example of a currently-functional private blockchain, I don't need any better examples than one that is working today. Sorry the Bitcoin blockchain you're so emotionally invested in is being passed over, but who can blame them when the 1MB developer pissing match has been going on for months? 


This is utterly irrelevant. A private blockchain is equally secure, you simply cannot access it without permission. All it takes is a few thousand dollars and nobody's permission to fuck with the Bitcoin blockchain and delay/increase the expense of transactions for everybody. It's also trivially easy to doublespend Bitcoins. There is no change coming that's going to make Bitcoin attractive for serious business use. Private chains are here regardless of whether or not your can comprehend their value 
Again, no surprise why Bitcoin's shitty and susceptible blockchain is being overlooked for more capable and **secure** chains. All the hashpower in the Bitcoin economy can't permanently damage any private chain and that's really all people invested in private chains care about. Again, Deal With It.

Very, very few retailers accept Bitcoin directly. You're likely "cashing out" at the point-of-sale and converting your BTC to USD, which the retailer accepts, than handing over BTC directly. 
In these instances, and with Bitcoin being such an attractive tool for tax evasion, I wouldn't be surprised if Bitpay/Coinbase are reporting Bitcoin spending to the IRS. 
To better directly answer your question - you owe income tax on any appreciation in Bitcoin's value between when you acquire and spend. This is what you owe, whether you report the gains or not is up to you.

And only 20 years until 99.5% have been mined, at which point (and much sooner) if there aren't millions more transactions then each tx fee will likely be measured in dollars, not cents. Those multimillion dollar mining farms aren't cheap to maintain, and control enough hashpower to ensure Bitcoin transactions only go to the highest bidder. 
Bitcoin adoption is not occurring fast enough to offset the rapidly depleting charity bitcoin is subsidized with. 
The block reward is going to be irrelevant within five years. The vast and overwhelming majority of it will be gone by then. 90% of the block reward will be claimed by 2021 and the remaining amount is so tiny it won't be a factor to offset transaction fees. For reference, if the block reward was done today and not in five years each transaction would cost $5. If adoption grows at the same rate in five years each transaction will be approximately $2.50, assuming miners make the same money they do today and difficulty doesn't change. You can presume that some miners will drop out but certainly not the biggest ones with the most to lose, they will simply control the network and only process the most expensive transactions

Do you know how ridiculous you sound?
Overhead? This isn't Bitcoin, a private chain could be operated on a '95 desktop computer without the ridiculous difficulty that Bitcoin has to tend with. 
"Isolation" means what, exactly? Privacy? Permissioned? **That's the entire point**
It's insane to see bitcoiners squirm to explain how pointless blockchains are unless it's the one they have a stake in. NASDAQ is already using one successfully, you can't simply waive that away or claim they could be doing the same thing with Excel. You're just babbling the only nonsense you can come up with to downplay this stuff. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:34:58
Cash discounts are typically because cash sales are not reported as income. The money you're saving is the lack of income tax not the savings on processing fees.
Also lmao at your attempt to downplay credit card rewards. Who cares if they are limited - at best you are paid to shop, at worst you have no fee - with Bitcoin you never receive a reward and always pay a fee. Its a plainly inferior system compared to what consumers already have available. 


Nice try, but you're still just babbling nonsense here. I pay no fees to use my card, get cash back and you pay the same price for goods with Bitcoin plus YOU pay a miners fee and you get no cash back. Clearly Bitcoin costs more in the long run than credit cards despite your best efforts to shout the opposite

I think the tipping point was companies like Bitpay and Coinbase being "tolerated" - Bitcoin was a p2p currency, note the lack of middleman. Then, Bitpay and Coinbase arrived and were seen by the loyal as "stepping stones" to mainstream adoption while actually completely bastardizing everything Bitcoin was created for. Bitcoin was created so companies like BitPay have no way to profit or KYC/AML you
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:20:16


Its exactly their business, and this information is something you essentially agree to provide when using their services. Don't like it?  Don't use Coinbase...or a bank. bitcoin wasn't invented to relieve these companies of AML requirements, it was created to avoid having to use these companies at all. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:03:59
The 1MB block size has not changed, bitcoin-related VC dropped like a rock in 2015 and *not a single new large merchant began accepting BTC in 2015*
I'm not saying I can predif the future but based on developer plans, current adoption rates and existing payment systems in competition I don't expect hockey-stick growth. This means that adoption doesn't occur quick enough to make up for the lost subsidy, which leaves consumers paying astronomical fees to get a transaction processed by one of the Chinese mining farms. 
Satoshi would be rolling in his grave if he saw what Bitcoin had turned in to. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:16:37


Its ludicrous for you to talk about what makes sense and then make contradictory statements like this - Nasdaq is *already* using a private chain for HFT. **its already happening** so you sound pretty naive saying they make no sense. The people at Nasdaq have already realized the utility of a private chain, the genie is out of the bottle. Deal with it. 


No, because bitcoin is decentralized and has to please everybody while centralized private chains (**like the one NASDAQ is using today** can be adjusted by a centralized entity. You have no source or credibility to claim that no other chain can scale better than Bitcoins, that doesn't even make sense. 
I can't wait for the nervous denial to go away, Bitcoiners believe their chain is the only one that will ever matter when the opposite is already true. You're in denial. It isn't hard to understand why a greater-than-3tps chain might be desirable.

@_date: 2015-06-21 18:14:38
2 transactions per second is not


the Visa stress test is 56,000 transactions per second, which could shut down the lowest-priority bitcoin transactions for a month


ironically, these 2 additional transactions per second are a lot less activity than if Amazon or Greece or almost anybody started using bitcoin. you're saying using bitcoin is hurting it because it can handle practically zero use. 


we're not talking about widespread adoption, even an additional 5 or 10 transactions per second is hurting bitcoin. we're basically talking *any additional adoption at all* at this point. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:47:01
if you need the thinking behind this explained i can play devils advocate
the 21 mil limit means miner subsidy basically expires in 20 years, most of all bitcoins will be mined and its not looking likely theyll be worth a million dollars each by then, even that wouldnt be enough to pay for the difficulty by that time, perhaps
increasing the limit means miners can rely on block reward for longer and less on fees, keeping bitcoin transactions cheap and attractive
holders wouldnt like an increase but holders dont secure the currency, miners do. 
anyway please don't downvote just for explaining this guy's mentality i doubt it will ever happen to but thats why he thinks so im guessing

Merchants pay more. Nobody cares about what merchants pay because even if they had cheaper processing they wouldn't lower the prices they would pocket the difference.

Okay, but the payment exists in some denomination of USD, whatever the value was at the time of transfer. it doesn't matter if the commodity being used as a payment is BTC or goats or chickens or beans. 


While the transfer was in BTC it still represented some amount of fiat. I can pay my employees in goats and chickens if they want, those commodities still represent some USD value and if I paid $10 for a goat originally and then used it to pay an hour of labor at $15 that would be a $5 gain. Same for Bitcoins. 


There is. If the Bitcoins were $400 each when purchased and $425 when used for payments the taxable portion is $25. This is very simple, taxes are owed on any appreciation. 


Yes. The contractor has to provide the value of the BTC at the time of purchase and at the time of use. 


The appreciated value. If you haven't "converted to fiat" (read: spent Bitcoin in any way) then the gains haven't been realized yet. 


Be realistic - there is hardly anywhere on the internet you can spend Bitcoins directly. For each and every large retailer accepting BTC it *is* a fiat transaction. 


It's simple, you just ensure the main gatekeepers are reporting. In your own examples, Coinbase would report the purchase and BitWage would report the payments.

Jesus that was a lot of rambling for nothing you did there. Calling out the bitcoin limit as arbitrary has nothing to do with language or perception or apples - its a simple fact. Bitcoins aren't "reliably scarce" as they were called in the original post I replied to - they are artificially scarce. There's nothing stopping miners from printing 22 million or 200 million bitcoins and so the "scarcity" of 21 million bitcoins mean nothing. Gold is valuable because it is actually scarce and barring meteorite mining there is a limited amount of gold in this world, not some random line of code limiting production
 
Again, trying to convince the public that Bitcoins (nothing but 1s and 0s on a computer screen) are rare and therefore valuable will be about as effective as trying to claim that there's a limited number of SMS or email to be sent worldwide. Data is not limited naturally, only artificially, and such artificial limitations carry no value.

More miners = more secure, but that's besides the point. 
The problem with Bitcoin isn't security, Bitcoin has too much security. Nobody needs mining to be this difficult, the problem with Bitcoin and the reason people are looking to other blockchains is that Bitcoin specifically doesn't scale well. It just wasn't designed to, and even the most optimistic growth rates provided by devs are insufficient for Bitcoin to be competitive or even widely used

You're adorable. A purpose-built blockchain capable of infinitely more TPS, faster confirmations, better stability than Bitcoin is "shitty" according to you because, wait for it, you aren't invested in them. Sad. If a private blockchain that perfectly suits their needs is "shitty" I can't even imagine the level of dogshit they must put Bitcoin on. 


Gee you really proved your case there. You can't access a private chain. All of the Bitcoin miners in the world can't do anything to permanently damage Linq or any other private chain. It's as secure as any Fortune 500 company needs it to be. Moreover, the units of their chain can't be manipulated or devalued by a handful of devs in a slapfight or by the whims of Chinese mining farms that control Bitcoin. Gosh it's such a mystery why Bitcoin is being passed over!


A single centralized authority is desirable for these companies using private chains. Sorry you are having trouble grasping this. News flash: Billions of people worldwide are happy to trust centralized sources, exactly why Coinbase and Bitpay have gained popularity and basically every P2P decentralized ideal of Bitcoin has been utterly abandoned.

So, let me get this straight, are you in denial about the fact that private chains exist (they do, NASDAQ is using one) or are you misinformed about their security? 
Let me help you out  - 
A private chain cabapble of handling millions is transactions securely could be created on demand. If one doesn't exist already its simply because nobody has needed a private chain with that capacity. Private chains are not expensive to produce or maintain. NASDAQ's Linq blockchain is just as secure as Bitcoin. By virtue of being private you can't attack it and anything done maliciously can be rolled back. 
Working, secure private blockchains exist. Deal With It.

NASDAQ and their currently operating Linq private blockchain strongly disagree with you and your utterly amateur opinion of what a private blockchain can do "just yet".
You have no idea what your babbling about. Private ledgers are companies who are interested in blockchain technology but can't work with Bitcoins absurd 3 tps max or 10 minute confirmation times. 
The only differences between the Bitcoin blockchain and private chains are that one is public and one is private. Otherwise they both work the same except again bitcoin has relatively pathetic 10 min confirmations and 3 tps maximums while private chains can be configured to confirm in 1 minute and be able to handle tens of thousands of writes.

how is it your business what someone's motivation is to use the blockchain? 
NASDAQ announced they intended to test the blockchain as well, you would think to see if it can efficiently run their business but now I suppose everybody will question their "real" motivations and accuse them of scamming too
people are literally complaining because someone announced they are actually going to use the blockchain. their motivations don't matter, the blockchain was made for everybody. you should be ashamed of yourself. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:34:06

you think a 16x increase in price can make up for 99.5% of current miner revenue? 
right now miners get 99.5% of their revenue from the block reward
in the time frame we're discussing miners will get basically 0% of their revenue from the block reward and most of it from transaction fees
if miners are mining 3600 btc a day at $250 each you think it will be offset by mining practically no bitcoins at $6000 each? everybody fighting for that last 1% 
your math is wrong. bitcoins would need to be worth millions to offset the current block reward
3600 BTC * 250 (generous value) = $900,000/day in block reward
$900,000 / $6000 = 150
that means 150 bitcoins a day necessary to maintain the current block reward level
in 2035 the block reward will be 


 
or roughly 56 bitcoins per day which is $336,000, or roughly a third of the current block reward


so are you saying you are not as smart as a toddler then? because your math was terrible there
you owe me an apology but its cool man i wasnt trying to start a fight here. like i said your math doesnt add up and it isn't conservative, whether it happens or not

The blockchain is too expensive for every small transaction to be on it, should just be a settlement layer


Bitcoin is not anonymous!


You should buy your Bitcoins from Circle and use Coinbase for transactions and check out my Trezor!


I don't care about merchant fees, give me that Bitcoin debit card that works exactly like my Mastercard!


Oh god why are you doing a stress test who gave you the right to use the blockchain somebody call the police


It is okay that merchants use Bitpay to sell my bitcoins for cash before giving it to the merchant
The answer is obviously greed. Bitcoin started with an ambitious future but practically every ideal has been abandoned by this point in the hopes that somehow people will buy bitcoins and be convinced they need scarce digital units
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:17:10
I'm surprised to see this on the front page,  especially from the guy who made the same accusations last night
this is merely a simulation of actual use. A company is paying fees to use the blockchain and bitcoin is so ill prepared for actual on-chain traffic that people are calling it an attack. they are paying valid fees just like any company who needs to use the blockchain does 
if they were shorting bitcoin they wouldn't publivally announce this test or their methodology and they might invest more than $300/hour
honestly to see this up voted is truly embarrassing. If amazon started using bitcoin for 2 transaction per second and clogged the network would OP also cry of am attack?

@_date: 2015-06-22 03:30:23


you don't sound particularly aware of the limitations of the network
if the good people of Greece decided to "save themselves" with Bitcoin, 8 of the 11 million people there would be able to make 1 transaction per month. if we switch to 8 MB blocks then, if nobody else uses the blockchain at all, then people in Greece could use bitcoin for roughly 6 transactions each per month
the answer to the question in your topic title is no. this isn't the time to encourage thousands of people to use bitcoin, it's the time to scale bitcoin to allow thousands of transactions per second so there isnt a problem immediately when demand arrives
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:28:12
Did you guys miss the post where coinwallet mentioned the stress test did not go as planned and was only 15% of the projected test?  Cause you wrote this whole blog post as if it was done with 100% intensity but yesterdays stress test was barely double normal traffic 
@_date: 2015-06-21 02:55:59


there is little evidence that the bitcoin blockchain can be used for fast processing. a stress test on monday of 2 transactions per second will cause day-long delays for transactions with low fees, it is not currently optimized for cheap, volumous transactions

so we're supposed to sit around with a capacity of less than 3 transactions per second until someone who needs 20 or 50 shows up clogging the network for weeks before the problem gets fixed?
we're way past the point of saying that we don't need to change. if I showed you two different transactions you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between "one idiot spamming" and some company trying desperately to use the shitty current blockchain. bitcoin is obviously not handling this just fine if tomorrow's light use is going to cause day-long delays for people trying to process transactions cheaply like they were told Bitcoin is good for

@_date: 2015-06-20 15:03:59


How about the fact that they announced the test? How about the fact that the test intensity is a tiny fraction of the "stress tests" that credit card companies submit themselves to? How about the fact that this is only costing them $300/hour, and if they wanted to actually attack the network they could spend 10x that and really harm the network


you literally cannot differentiate between this use and legitimate use. if a big company started using the blockchain tomorrow it would be the same thing.
what you're really saying is that bitcoin can't handle any large retailers or transaction volume right now. that's loud and clear, and at a time when NASDAQ officials are considering doing the same testing.

okay pal








what *shit*? 
what is "clear to you" isn't very relevant if you think your opinion of the definition of conservative means you are automatically right. conservative simply doesn't mean aggressive growth like you're saying. 
you're wrong about the whole concept of conservative estimates and now you're backing away from your statements in the most childish way by claiming that I "don't have an argument" because i'm politely trying to tell you that conservative growth would be 100% maybe every 10-20 years and anything beyond that wouldn't be, regardless of what happened before. history has no guarantees of repeating itself and the idea that you think it does doesn't allow you to change the very definition of the word conservative to suit your beliefs about more bubbles coming
ill add one last time that, even though it isn't conservative it is not impossible, but growth of 100% every 4 years until 2035 isn't remotely enough to offset the loss of the block reward. coins could be worth 16x more and still not be worth enough considering how little they are receiving by then. im not trying to argue with you, these are just all facts and common definitions.
i hope you have a good day too pal

this isn't conservative, because doubling every 4 years means $500 in 2019, $1000 by 2024, $2000 by 2029 and $4000 by the time frame i'm talking about 
bitcoins costing $4000 a piece is hardly conservative with the current growth we've seen and limitations of the network we're seeing. 
the mining reward right now makes up 99.5% of miner revenue, so bitcoins going from $250 to $4000 isnt going to make up that difference, your math is way off there.

i dont see it at all because its not there. that's not a conflict of interest, it's again just a simulation of actual use. would you be complaining about manipulation if amazon started using the network intensively? 
futhermore, this is a free market. if a company wants to fill the network with transactions and pay whatever fees they need to do so then that's bitcoin working as intended, nothing to complain about. 
this kind of action is going to force a lot of hands sooner rather than later potentially for the benefit of bitcoin in the long run. 
this is a lighthearted use test. two transactions per second. Visa stress tests their network with **56,000**. this is a gentle prod at worst and an otherwise completely valid use of the network, it's outrageous for anybody to be complaining about a specific entity beginning to use 2 transactions per second *for any reason*

Are you going to accuse every company who wants to perform a mild amount of transactions on-chain of DDOS attacks?  
sometimes I literally cannot believe how immature this community is. if they are paying fees they can,  just like you can,  use the network like everybody else and if they didn't announce this you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this "attack" and Amazon accepting Bitcoin. So essentially would you be crying about Amazon manipulating Bitcoin if they ever did take it,  along with anybody else who has a business doing more than 2 transactions per second.

this is totally cringeworthy, my friend
they are a company using the bitcoin. if they didnt announce it as a stress test you wouldn't know the difference between that and any large new user. even if bitcoin goes up to 5-10 tps thats nowhere near enough to start taking on large new userbases, and you can't just say no or complain about their intentions when large users start using the blockchain and it cant handle the traffic


NASDAQ is supposed to be testing the blockchain. if they decided to run a paltry 50 transactions per second (less than .1% of a Visa stress test) would you say they are "dishonest idiots"? 
you have a right to complain about a DDOS attack but you have to recognize that at this point there's literally no difference between something you call an attack and an influx of new users like people have been begging for. as a bitcoin owner it should be truly embarrassing to call people who want to use the blockchain for any reason "idiots" because the technology can barely handle any traffic at all. the fact they concealed their identity is one of the fucking foundations of the technology and using it isnt the same as intentionally harming it.

conversely, I dont think you can argue they arent simply using the network regardless of their worded intentions. 
if they never made the thread and simply did the test, you wouldnt be able to tell the difference between that new mystery activity,a planned stress test or a large retailer using the blockchain. 
if the only difference is that they claimed it was a "simulated attack" but it is in practice *the exact same activity as normal retail transactions* then you cannot logically say it isn't simply using the network, they are literally identical transactions in practice. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:53:31

Sure they do, but unlike Bitcoin when something malicious happens on a private chain they simply roll back the changes. This exact same thing happened to Bitcoin a few years ago, actually. 
Listen - the *entire point* of a private chain is that these banks don't trust each other directly but are willing to create a web of trust and nobody is going to risk their access with malicious actions that are simply rolled back. 


and it's stunningly obvious that you don't understand the benefits of private chains and why companies are infinitely more likely to use them than Bitcoin's pathetic 3 tps irreversible nightmare

You're right, Bitcoin - which has been rolled back after billions of Bitcoins were created out of thin air - is the only secure blockchain in existence.

The tokens they use to transfer assets are the "currency" - this need not be public or carry any cash value. It's still a blockchain they're using, like it or not. Its interesting to see Bitcoin owners downplay these advancements simply because use of a private blockchain doesn't effect you.

Honestly, it's a pretty "newbie" myth that the block reward is a significant factor for 100+ years. Most seasoned Bitcoin regulars know most of the reward will be gone in the next 20 years and the remaining block reward is relatively insignificant. Considering it's gonna be almost 100 years to mine the last .5% of the block reward it makes sense that transaction fees will be in full effect long before the full 21M have been mined. 
The bitcoin economy is unrecognizable compared to the last halving, there were 0 multi-million dollar mining farms last time around. It's not unreasonable for miners to expect to recoup some of the lost block reward from this upcoming halving from higher transaction fees and choose to only process the highest-paying transactions. 
To put this all in context: In order for miner profitability to remain constant either the price needs to double overnight or miners need to charge $5 per transaction. It's unlikely the price will double *after* the halving because most people buying beforehand are considering the halving as a major source of their own demand, you buy before the halving and not after.

bear in mind this was just my understanding could definitely be wrong
the transactions would be happening on the sidechain not the known public blockchain and so you wouldn't know that each coin represents $1 or $1000 on the sidechain, its just being used for private purposes and that 1 satoshi representing the sidechain on the main chain represents ownership of the entire market cap/value of the side chain
this is the only way it would make sense to steal value from the main chain i guess

If everybody knows it's coming, it has to be priced in. The same demand that exists now before the halving (and in anticipation of it) won't necessarily exist (or double) afterwards. 
Why would you wait until after the halving to buy when the event itself is supposed to cause appreciation?
If the event is known, where would new additional halving-based demand come from? Why wouldn't this demand already be present? 
In all likelihood the halving will come and go and the only thing that will really happen is a pretty severe drop in miner profitability, possibly leading to miners seeking to regain lost revenue via selectively processing only high-fee transactions. 
If the price doesn't double (and hold stable) then it's a net loss for miner revenue and there's no serious and sustainable new demand looming while bitcoin's future is decided - the halving is going to be an ugly economic event, not the free money everybody thinks they are getting. The price action of the last halving is totally irrelevant, there weren't multi-million (billion?) dollar mining farms during the last halving. In the current bitcoin ecosphere this is the end of the low-transaction free ride and the start of miners starting to actually demand more than 5 cents to process a transaction in any kind of timely manner

Don't be disingenuous, that $0.03 doesn't include any conversion fees while the $10 at Western Union gets you local fiat. Sending someone Bitcoins is not an apples-to-apples comparison to sending fiat remittances. 


Not really, for the aforementioned reasons. If I send you a code to a $10 Playstation card can I call that a $10 remittance? You just have to convert it to fiat (just like Bitcoin recipients)

Very wrong. Visa "confirms" up to 56,000 transactions per second. That involves checking to see if the consumer has available credit - that's it. Merchants can take up to 90 days to get paid but that's not a confirmation, that's settlement.

You can't abort the transaction ever. The best you can do is submit a new transaction for the same coins with a higher fee, and that second transaction (a doublespend) will confirm before the first, nulling the first. 
It's hard to say when a transaction is "locked in". I don't think it's safe to say that its only one confirmation, because your confirmation could be on an orphaned block. Devs are officially suggesting 36 confirmations (360 minutes) before you can consider your transaction safely in the main blockchain

No, it wouldn't, it would still only process an average of 2.7 tps.

I'm just talking in the short term here, despite a 10+hour backlog and rising transaction costs the price didn't flinch.

I get your point about miners needing to mine transactions for this currency to ultimately work at all, but *not* mining transactions both hasn't affected the price and isn't necessary to claim more than 99% of their regular income. That's a problem.

No, you can send an amount of Bitcoins worth (for some short period of time) exactly $100k....
...Then the person on the other end has to find somewhere to spend or cash out $100k worth of Bitcoins, almost certainly involving a linked bank account. You also likely involved a bank when first purchasing those Bitcoins, unless you are a lucky early adopter or otherwise bought $100k worth of BTC on localbitcoins


For a prominent bitcoin user, it strikes me as odd you can't correlate these two. 
Wider adoption means slower Bitcoin service for everybody, as demonstrated by the stress test. The more users you dogpile on to bitcoin's limited blockchain the longer all those users wait for cheap transactions or the more those users pay for fast ones. The "rising waters" of transaction fees already reared their head during last week's stress test. Transactions going from five cents to 25 cents may not seem like a big deal but again, that's not indicative of actual worldwide adoption. You get tens or hundreds of millions of people using Bitcoins and suddenly it's neither cheaper nor faster than other remittance options. 
Maintaining a fast and cheap transaction speed should be paramount right now, since new users aren't going to be attracted to a slow and expensive-at-scale system like "killer app" Bitcoin


This isn't the internet in 1995, this is modern-day. Useful technologies are adopted by hundreds of millions of people overnight, it's not that a bunch of luddites have failed to recognize the usefulness of Bitcoins, it's that a bunch of people recognize bitcoin offers no benefits beyond their current systems and those people it does benefit will not see the same benefits at scale. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:46:46


Bitcoin was supposed to mean cheap commerce for everybody. What you're missing is that this has turned into "Bitcoin isn't for everybody, only those who pay the toll" and the toll is already rising with roughly 3 million users. 
Once upon a time Bitcoin had a dream to bank the unbanked and allow use for anybody with no restrictions. Between that time and now is the 180 I'm talking about where you're happily talking about who can and cannot use the network and the network limitations are so pathetically low that basically anybody wanting to use the network would be a spammer at this point. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:50:59
A transaction does not occur until it has been confirmed at least once, which is supposed to take ten minutes on average. 
With the current backlog, low or no fee transactions will not see a confirmation for 10-24 hours. Paying a higher fee will get your transaction processed quicker. 
With the current validation issues, you're supposed to wait for **36 confirmations** before considering your transaction safely completed. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:10:17
I'm really not. It's genuinely surprising that you're begging for adoption on the same limited 2.7 tps that simulated adoption was called "an attack" on just last week.

This is provably untrue - miners can collect the block reward on blocks that contain 1 or even 0 transactions, which is no help to the network backlog yet earns them the same reward. 
Miners don't care about processing transactions or fees, fees make up less than 1% of their income. Mining the block reward is all miners care about

And for weeks was "under attack" because someone dared to actually use the network with paid transactions. This use was called spam and immediately people wanted to police the blockchain


So robust that miners were discovered to not even be validating transactions at all. So robust that with an 80,000 tx backlog many pools were still mining blocks with only a handful of transactions.

Aside from that, it seems like you think you can easily make $5k a month just buying bitcoins from A and selling them at B. It isn't that simple. The first time the price flash crashes on you you'll lose your profits, Bitcoin is so volatile that you can't count on a stable price from one hour to the next - sometimes this will be to your benefit and sometimes to your detriment but its basically so unstable you'll never have a reliable income.

That's strange - you know Bitpay is doing terribly, right?

They aren't actually claiming to have made a new currency - it's marketing speak. They're the new way to think of money - as digital, effortless, and convenient. Bitcoin only marks one of those boxes, fyi.

Wow, a whole whopping $10k. I wonder what fraction of one percent of the total bitcoin network electricity costs that represents? 
To put this in context: Miners receive **99.5%** of their money from the block reward, which is nothing but a thin-air charity subsidizing the network and hiding the true transaction costs, which are astronomical at this use rate. In a few months, when the block reward halves, miners will lose an even 50% of that revenue stream that represents almost 100% of their income...will they just eat the loss or try to recoup the loss from fees? 
Simple math dictates the lost block reward would bring the cost of a transaction into the dollars and a daily transaction fee average more fitting for a network less reliant on charity to operate.

I can't/won't, but the traditional banking infrastructure serve billions of people globally and I think proportionally you'd find it uses much less resources much more efficiently than Bitcoin's insane difficulty rate being used to process transactions.
I'm not trolling or antagonizing here, it's just common sense that a centralized system serving the entire world is more efficient than difficulty-arms-race Bitcoin doing nothing but wasting millions of dollars of electricity to process less than 2 transactions per second

No, it is not. You pay the fees you get to use the network, that's the very essence of Bitcoin.

No, it doesn't. Fees are too high for the poor, and the technology is too complicated for pretty much everyone else. 
How does bitcoin make sense versus MPESA when MPESA is easier to use, has lower fees and a stable price?  
This may be news to you but the unbanked don't want to have to biy Bitcoins, pay fees, wait for confirmations nor do they even have the internet..they are poor. Bitcoin is used by less than 1 million active users and fees have already doubled in the last year. Imagine how many days a transaction would take to process of Bitcoin served a few billion

This...is laughable. Not the direction Bitcoin is going, not that Bitcoin could handle that kind of traffic if it actually *were* appealing as a currency. 


It's so incredibly naive to call these kinds of services a step in the right direction. It's a middlemen for a currency literally created to avoid middlemen, and now there's no going back. Merchants will always use third-parties and never actually accept BTC *because they can*. 


The enormous fees one pays along the way counts as a concession, a concession that most US citizens aren't going to make. Having a bank account isn't undesirable, nor does Bitcoin accomplish everything a bank does.

And, just curious, why exactly would Bitcoin jump to $10,000 /coin considering the current landscape and horizon?  Companies like Armory are seeing too little business to maintain operations, Bitcoin retailers are seeing stagnant or declining sales and banks are using the technology without using Bitcoin 
Despite the recent price bump (and subsequent slide) things are not really trending up for Bitcoin adoption or the kind of demand that would require $10,000 coins. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:12:32


No, it isn't, because Uphold most likely does all of their transactions "off-chain" (aka not using Bitcoin at all). $868M for a payment company is absolute peanuts, and wisely they don't mention Bitcoin once on their main website page.

You DO need to sign up as a money transmitter. The only instance where you don't need to is when simply using Bitcoins for shopping...which doesn't sound like what you're doing. If you're buying and selling bitcoins (a currency) for profit...why wouldn't you need a license?

Well, for starters, your average fee jumps about 100% in the last year despite still only a tiny fraction of the population using Bitcoin. If adoption actually occurred the network would be so clogged with transactions right now you'd be happy to pay 90 cents or $9 for a confirmation

Except the difficulty has gone up more than 100% since then and miners are going to be paying the same bills with half the revenue

Because MPESA, unlike Bitcoin, does not require an internet connection or to buy volatile Bitcoins or is reliant on the limited capacity Bitcoin network. If Bitcoin actually saw massive adoption fees to fit into a block anytime soon would make it prohibitively expensive.

How on earth could a maximum 10 transactions per second (this is being generous) be considered optimal for a worldwide payment network? 
Imagine Paypal was only capable of five transactions per second and some executive in a meeting said "maybe that's all we'll ever need guys?"

If the price doesn't go up then it should. 
Miners currently make more than 99% of their total revenue from the block reward and less than 1% from transaction fees
Now, that 99% is going to be cut directly in half. If the price doubled they wouldn't notice a difference but if it doesn't then presumably they would want to make up some lost revenue by only processing transactions with suitable fees

Fast forward to the future when the Bitcoin block reward is expired. miners, who process transactions, will be paid with fees. These fees will be paid by people who need to process a transaction. 
The blockchains you are talking about are just going to be privately mined and have fees paid by the people who use the private network. This money doesn't need to come from the network itself (block rewards) nor does it need to be denominated in any blockchain-specific currency. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:42:28
Exactly this. Its ridiculous to assume that companies are spending tremendous resources mining their private chains - the only reason Bitcoin mining is so difficult and expensive is because it is public.
