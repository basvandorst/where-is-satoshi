People long for the days where as long as you believed in crypto, you knew what to do. Buy bitcoin. Now the waters are murky. There's much more risk of another coin becoming  Bitcoin might never go higher than it is now. I think that's unlikely, but before all the alts, the chance of that was basically zero. It's also partially a feeling that things have progressed so far beyond just being aware of what bitcoin is and its potential and being able to profit from that. The idea that you might miss out on the next alt that goes up 2000% in a week because you held BTC instead for 10% gains over the last month. BTC feels almost like a traditional investment compared to the chaos that is the new market of altcoins and ICOs. The people who felt special now feel like they're missing out.

Lolling hard at everyone who bought at 15k acting like this is a disaster when I'm still up 50% compared to 30 days ago.

This question is absolutely nonsense. What you invest should be based on your net worth. What one person is willing to risk losing in crypto might be enough to buy a house for someone else, while that someone else might be trying to be able to just afford a house some day, and someone else might just be trying to turn $20 into $200.

Uh, do you really need it explained that you can't send cash (safely) to someone across the country or across the world?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:07:44
If the entire crypto market doesn't go down by 90% but BTC does, it will be absolutely dead.

ACH transfer? 5-7 business days. New Years Day isn't a business day. Saturday and Sunday aren't either. So today is only the 5th business day since you sent it.

You bought a bitcoin, and sold it for the same price you bought it for, with a capital gain of $0. They bought it for whatever price you purchased it from from you, so their cost basis is whatever you bought it at, not whatever it was worth when you transferred it to them.

I just use GDAX as a BTC transfer service. Costs me nothing. Costs them $ each time. If I want to deposit some BTC onto, say, 5 different exchanges, I send it to GDAX first, and pay 1 TX fee. Then send it out to the other exchanged from GDAX and they cover all 5 TX fees for me. Thanks, idiots!

Attack by incompetence. Coinbase was 50% of transactions, and refused to implement segwit or even batching.

BTC is already divisible to 8 decimal places. With consensus, more can be added at any time. Each decimal place is an already existing "split" by a factor of 10. Stocks need to split because they are not divisible.

You're asking a question where the answer is specific to you to a bunch of strangers. It's like me asking how much weight I should lift to make progress on building muscle without giving any other information. Especially since you framed it as "if you were to buy right now". You didn't say "I'm a 17 year old with some christmas money, how much should I buy?"
See, that would make the question not nonsense.

It can definitely fuck things up short-term. Difficulty only adjusts every 2 weeks. Also, there's a limit to how much it can change per adjustment, although it's a pretty high limit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:56:35
This has nothing to do with bitcoin or crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:24:49
I honestly have no idea if this was the case, but accepting off-chain transactions through some partnership with coinbase allowing coinbase users to send them bitcoins instantly and without a TX fee would definitely constitute "accepting coinbase" but be very different than accepting BTC in general.

Mostly because of the storage requirements. Double the block size, double the storage and bandwidth costs of running a full node.

lul 
I know that this is but this thread is basically about the entire crypto market crashing at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:01:02
That's true, but not sure why you're replying to me with that.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:28:31
Many people here are more interested in considering their BTC balance rather than locking in fiat gains. You shouldn't consider any gains "locked in" until they're in the form of whatever you're trying to increase. If that's fiat, then there's your answer. No Crypto is safe from large movement, and even when some coins are in the green when the entire rest of the market is red, you'd have to correctly guess which coin that will be to use that to preserve your gains through a market correction.

Less people mine, which decreases difficulty, until an equilibrium is met.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:37:55
True. I mostly just meant that 2 weeks is the absolute minimum amount of time that a difficulty decrease could take. But that would be with 0% of current mining power.

This is probably terrible advice, but for a crypto:crypto trade, I use the most tax-favorable valuation for that day. So if I own 3 bitcoins, and my cost basis is $3,000 for all three, and I trade 1BTC to ETH, when I determine my "profit" I use the lowest bitcoin price for the day. If it was $13,500, even if BTC was at $15,000 when I made the trade, I'd put my profit as $12,500, and my cost basis for my ETH would become $13,500 instead of $15,000, so when I sell or trade the ETH, my taxable profit is higher. But my taxes now are lower.

It's a bitcoin fork. At least google for 1 second before explaining something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:03:45
Uh, do you just not read anything? Four days before they launched it, they released a roadmap saying they would only allow withdrawals lmfao. Google for, like, 3 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:21:46
Yes. First in, first out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:48:17
Then read the TOS?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:51:52
Not at all relevant to what is being asked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:07:51
Not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:16:36
You're right. It would be profitable, just much less profitable than other cryptos. I should have said "it will probably be profitable but you could make a bigger profit with another crypto, and then trade it for BTC"
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:02
True, but still, for any given tax rate, even when selling high and buying low, there's an amount that the price would need to drop to make you not lose money to taxes. The 10% difference for you between long term and short term capital gains just changes the amount that the price would still have to drop. Assuming you want to reinvest your profits from selling high into bitcoin again at a lower price, obviously.

That's not how the math works.
