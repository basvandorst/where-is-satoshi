Yes. I always buy the dips. But everyone's first dip is stressful and part of the learning curve. Sounds like you have the right mindset though!
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:54:28
Don't panic when it falls 30% at the next correction. People always freak and cause mass panic sells. Keep calm. And hodl that shit

@_date: 2017-09-14 00:25:04
Haven't thought about that... the flip side is there will be a bunch of new buyers in the market who fall for it lol

They will find a way. Best guess would be something like Nicehash. Sell the hashpower and not the coins

When price drops to $2,300 will you be selling the other one?

No because he doesn't run the network. It is distributed. After he released it, and it was wildly adopted, he has no more power than you or me outside of influence. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:53:22
Very basic facts. But not too much on the specifics. But the biggest problems I see right now are the DCG and there links to banks and the development being moved to a corporation that also has links to the DCG.
I have tried to search on Google, but I'm not coming up with anything like I've seen linked by the community. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:45:07
Anyone can view the code. Any backdoor would be visible and obvious. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:01:35
Segwit! It's not the same as segwit2x. You're helping the development not destroying it :D
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:24:00
Exactly. For criticism I'll give you a few points to improve.
1. Actually talk about something that ads value to the crypto community. This literally added none. 
Ask yourself why someone in this space would want to watch your video.
2. You talk about yourself a LOT. Far mor than a viewer is comfortable with. All about how you're such a loving and giving person. No one cares. People care what's in it for them. And in this space it's usually financial gain or a freedom movement. 
3.  Far too many kickbacks to social media. Too much talking about your Snapchat and other things. Don't talk about snap. Talk about BTC
 
It makes you appear like ditsy girl who is disconnected from crypto, and the world.
I think you can get past that, and improve. But this is currently extremely hard to watch.

To each his own! There's a difference between hodling what you've already bought, and buying 15 mins after everyone's fears that caused a 20% drop are near confirmed. China's markets are wayyyyy below ours. Be prepared to see all our life's savings plummet ��

I sure hope you're right... else my wife is going to be reeeeeaaaaaal pissed about the amount I bought late last night when she wakes up
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:53:09
That would be great! Except you have losers like me who put WAY to much of there savings into it :D

First of all congrats on supporting the real Bitcoin!
Running a full node is different from mining. 
The nodes validate the transactions before they get to the miners. Then the miners do the actual calculations. The benefit of a full node is it strengthens the network by making it much harder for invalid blocks to get through by malicious nodes. 
Someone can correct me if I am wrong. 
You don't actually get any personal benefit outside of  the satisfaction helping the core network, casting your vote, being able to analyze the blockchain, and giving the middle finger the centralization and the banksters.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:29:35
It sounds horrible... but I hope it does happen! Ready to give the banks to boot, and make some money in the process ����

I doubt the majority sold, because it is just the exchanges. We don't know to what extent this will go as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:20:06
Well then you could have a million bitcoins passed down to his heirs. Also remember "Satoshi" is more than possibly a group. They could be waiting with $4,00,000,000. Worth of bitcoins today. It's would be in there best interest to wait for the price to rise. With such a huge amount.

"Girl gone crypto"? A more appropriately channel name would be titled "Girl wants to be a vlogger so she injects herself into niche market of nerds just to talk about herself, in case they actually get lambos" 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:42:18
No one knows. In theory the market cap before the split should be split between the two chains so no "free money" is made. But in practice last time it was just free money born out of thin air (but probably slowed down the climb of BTC).
Personally, I believe segwit2x and BTG are so incredibly shitty that the majority of people will sell them to buy more BTC, causing a slight bump in price. Then once people realize that bitcoin can withstand dirty forks It will probably rally to $10,000 over the next month or so afterwards.
That is just my personal opinion and anyone can say I'm full of shit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:13:44
Awesome! Exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for!
