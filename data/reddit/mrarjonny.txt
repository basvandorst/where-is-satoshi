First you must look deep within yourself and take inventory of all the things you value.  
Then you embark on the spiritual journey of what you value most, and more importantly WHY you value.  
It is only then that you will begin to understand your personal spectrum of value and perhaps you will share it with us when it reveals itself to you. Good luck, friend.

For the sake of argument 50 euro will get you ~0.01 bitcoin right now.
You will hold that bitcoin as long as you want.  You can have 0.01 bitcoin forever.  
Today it is VALUED at 50 euros because 1 bitcoin = 7964.38 euros
If the value of bitcoin drops down to 10 euros in the future, you will still have 0.01 bitcoins, but it will be valued at 0.1 Euros.  
It can't really go to zero.  
It is similar to buying a car.  You have the car, but its value might go up if it becomes a collectors edition, or a rarity and you take good care of it, or the value can go down.  How much you sell it for later can change.  But you still have the same car you bought.  You physically have the car.  
Or an even simpler example is a physical coin.  If you have a physical euro note in your hand it doesn't change.  You will always have one euro.  But twenty years from now it might be worth more or less depending on the economy and markets.

If you run a full node you strengthen the network and ensure the consensus of the protocol.  
Essentially they are the core of the bitcoin network that make sure everyone is on the same page, and they prevent the hijacks of forking or miners imposing their will.  
So if you want to strengthen the network and make sure bitcoin remains what it is, then you run a node.  It is almost like voting for Bitcoin.  Running a node is more of a service, or a giving back to the community as I understand it.  It helps keep bitcoin alive for everyone.  
So it is incredibly "important" that they exist, but there isn't an overwhelming amount of benefit on an individual level apart from what you mentioned, as I understand it.  I run one on my girlfriends barely used laptop, and I just let it do its thing in the background.  It was a good learning experience for me, and it helps the network in the tiniest little way.

I don't care about market value.  Happy to see it go up, and I monitor it but I honestly don't care.  
I truly believe its buying power will increase, with the future I envision, of a crypto economy.  
So I don't really give a fuck if I can buys lambos and mansions and retire off of it, but I would like to live in a world where the bit I put aside could be used to directly pay for my kids education or an addition on my house.  
I would be far more excited to see its use, and adoption sky rocket rather than its value compared to the dollar.  I also think it will naturally lead to it being worth more, but I am not banking on that aspect.  
All I am banking on is being my own banker in 20 years.

It's kind of a weird thing sort of "lead a horse to water, can't make it drink"
You can have people explain it a million different ways but they can't understand it for you.  I am going to be perfectly honest.  It took me weeks for me to wrap my head around it.  I had to read articles constantly.  Watched videos. I even tried explaining it a few times to people without having any clue what the hell I was talking about hahaha.  I still probably don't have a clue. 
I would try to explain to my girlfriend what I was so interested in and this new hobby and she would ask me questions I had no idea how to answer, so it gave me new lists of things to read about.  
It slowly started to make more and more sense.  I even had to unlearn some things in the process of learning.  Had to think about money entirely differently to fully wrap my mind about a non-tangible "backed by nothing" cash system.  
I would have moments where the lightbulb went off and there was sudden clarity, in an AA good of my own understanding sense lol.  
Try watching Banking on Bitcoin it's on Canadian Netflix right now. That for me, did the best job of bridging me from total skeptic without a clue to a "believer" 
I'd be happy to try and explain to you how I understand it, but I am far from an expert and I have not been into this very long.  I would hate to share shakey information, I am not 
an expert.  Also it is very late.  If you want to message me or ask any specific questions I am happy to help or point you in a direction I think might give you the answer.

I think the “in it for the technology” thing is a little silly, and misses the mark.  
It is like the “I read Playboy for the articles” of days gone by.  
Personally I think of it more as a philosophy.  I have a basic laymen’s knowledge of how the technology works, and it is of interest to me up to the point of being a hobby, or something to read while sitting on the toilet, but it is a bit much to say that I am in it, for the technology.  
I like the idea, of a new currency of the people.  I like the promise of a future with fewer third parties in trade.  I like the idea of a world without centralized banks.  These are the sorts of thing I am actually in it for.  
The technology is neither here, nor there.  So few of us are developers or know how to manipulate it.  We have a working knowledge.  I am not into owning a laptop “for the technology.” It is a tool that came from technological advancements that makes my life easier.  In to it, up to a point.
As far as the profit?  It doesn’t concern me too much.  I really hope to see the value of anything I own go up.  It is ridiculous for anyone to say they wouldn’t.  So of course, I am into that idea too.  Again with my computer analogy, I am not going to stop using a laptop or not buy a car because it will likely depreciate in value.  They are both technologies and tools I support even at a loss.  I would say I say the same about crypto.  
I might look for a certain car that might depreciate less…or perhaps even be rare and go up in value, I look at crypto purchases the same.  Ultimately, it is not a for profit endeavor for me.  I use cars for practical reasons.  To get around.  
I guess my answer is, a question.  Can it be both, and more?

Okay, so you put in $15 and it might be the easiest $150 bucks you ever made, if it goes up another 1000%
Whats the problem?  
If it never goes up again its like saving money under your mattress.  At least it was safe from theft or other frauds while you held it in bitcoin. 
If it goes down.  That's life too.  Sometimes you put money into things that don't hold value. It is really not that big of a deal.  Hell, the dollar itself is losing value in North America, so I personally I think, "why the hell not?"
If I don't put it in Bitcoin I'd waste it on some other stupid shit.  I quit drinking, and started putting that money into crypto, and away I go.  No matter what happens I am better off.

Dude, your hands can't possibly be that weak.  You bought at all time high, it hit more all time highs and we are still higher than early December (last I checked)
What did you think was going to happen.  Look at the 9 year chart of BTC prices.  It is mostly a flat line.  This is pretty normal.  Just because it does have "volatile" and quick swings it doesn't mean you are always making 100% gains every month.  
Stop stressing about market value and chill.  Checking the price every few hours is not going to do yourself any favours.  Either sell because this isn't for you, or realise there is a bit of a long game required.  Maybe just sit on it for six months and then take another look at it.  If you are getting impatient after 2 months you the hodl life may not be for you friend.

1. Currently high transaction fees, this has not always been the case and will not always be the case
2. I think you would be incredibly hard pressed to find all the wallet addresses someone has the keys for, when you look at transactions (for example  do you honestly think it is that easy to track who that Bitcoin is going to? and that might only be a sliver of how much Bitcoin they hold.  It is kind of like looking at someones house or car and knowing their exact worth.  It is only at times a small indication and even then, if you are careful about how you handle your crypto, it is possible to have block-chain addresses that are next to impossible to link to you.  The level of obfuscation is high enough to provide a reasonable level of privacy.  Which is why people DO trust it, and value it, even at present.  
So unlike your funds in a bank.  Your Bitcoin is not inherently tied to you, and therefore, the government can not force anyone to reveal your balances, nor can anyone seize your assets in Bitcoin forcibly. They can't prove you have it, and they can't take it from you.  I don't know of any asset like that.  In and of itself, that is pretty valuable.  That is just one reason.

Sorry pal.  Lazy and Bitcoin don't go together.
If you don't put in any work you don't get the results. 
I hope you find someone to help you out, but at the end of the day you still have to convince them that you are a real person and not scamming them (or more perhaps more importantly verify they aren't scamming you) if might even involve meeting in person which is substantially less lazy than smiling for your webcam.
It is actually MORE work to circumvent fees and avoid verification.  Plus you need to put in the work to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and your private keys are sufficiently secure.  
Long story short, if you want to get into cryptocurrency I strongly recommend you put in the research and the time to learn to do it the way that isn't lazy.  It is actually easier, and safer. 
Good luck.

This is my sentiment.  I use QuadrigaCX with an err on the side of caution.  
Never leave more than I am comfortable losing INSTANTLY on the exchange.  There is the general "don't invest more than you are willing to lose rule" I use for investing, but there is an extra, "don't leave anymore than you are willing to have stolen" rule I use for exchanges.  
I am comfortable with the idea of the market value going down.  I am not comfortable with trusting anyone other than me with my private keys.

How much bitcoin do I hold in addresses I have the private keys for?
I think people underestimate how obfuscated Bitcoin makes people.  You might be able to link an address or two an individual, but what kind of energy does it take to link everything?  There are certain simple measures that make it about as private as your car or house being an indicator or your over all wealth, in my opinion.

Hello fellow Canadian.  May I recommend the Canadian service  based out of Vancouver?  They have been by far the easiest and quickest to deal with and they have no fees, their exchange rate isn't the best compared to live trading rates, but it is really the most straightforward way for Canadian's to get their first BTC.  I am still fairly new and I have tried a number of them.  Coinbase, MyBTC.ca, and QuadrigaCX.  All of them worked fine but have verying degrees of fees involved and varying level of difficulty.  
I am no expert by any means but that is my recommendation.  To get your feet wet.  If you have any questions drop me a line and I will try to help you out.  The nTrust customer service is excellent.  They will answer any questions you have. If you are thinking of signing up, I can give you a reference code which gives us each 2 bucks as a tiny little referral incentive.  That will get you rolling, and you will be able to easily buy bitcoin with your debit card.  
Good luck.

Yes you can. 
is a simple to set up windows app that pool mines and pays out next to nothing.
I run it on my PC in the background at work for a few bucks worth of bitcoin a month.  You will hear a lot of "not worth it" which is absolutely true.  You are essentially paying more for electricity than you are receiving in bitcoin.  Its really isn't worth it.  However you can, if you really want to.

No virtual of patient because Bitcoin recovered from a crash in 2013 I am supposed to have no issue at all with a log jammed 280000 unconfirmed transactions and 700 sat/byte transactions getting stuck for ages?  My point was simply that the network is barely useable at the moment which I going to drive some money elsewhere and possibly affect the price of Bitcoin.  It's a fair point to make.  I don't see how that has anything to do with how long I have held Bitcoin or anything about me at all.  It was just an observation.  But sure.  Guess I will just go fuck myself right?

A lot going on here.
Your coins are ALWAYS online.  They are stored on the blockchain at public address that can only be accessed with your private key.  
Wallets store your private key offline.  So if your computer can be hacked, so can electrum and your key could be stolen.  It is currently mathematically impossible to hack the private key from the address alone.
But I could theoretically hack your computer and somehow swipe your wallet data and keys.  Using electrum your device (phone or computer) is still somehow connected online, making you in some way shape or form open to an attack.
The seed is a simplified way to restore your private keys if they are ever lost.  Your keys themselves unhackable unless...some one also steals your seed.
The only TRUE cold storage is a paper wallet made on a device that is not connected to the internet.  Or a hardware wallet which is a special device that is built with hardware that never allows your seed or keys to be on any other device.

 It's only a verification based on info they already have access to.  You don't need to provide any additional private data to Equifax or sign up with them. 
The exchanges require quite a bit of identification by law.  If you are looking to sell or cash out on an exchange they basically need a selfie in your underwear holding your passport.  The underwear part is a stretch, but it is pretty invasive.  It's the price you pay using an exchange.  It's not really the Equifax part that should alarm you. What if the whole exchange has a data breach like Equifax did?  It's a risk that you have to assess yourself.  I can't make the decision for you.  
Long story short.  I don't think the Equifax part should alarm you but if you are deeply concerned about privacy, which is completely understandable, you will want to avoid exchanges entirely, which I imagine isn't very convenient but possible.  I think for most of us and myself included we just through a little caution to the wind in a risk versus reward decision and just sucked it up and do the verification.  If it bites me in the ass those are the breaks.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:09:36
I tried this out with very small amounts and it was far from successful. I didn't really lose anything but would have been further ahead if I just bought in and hodled.
It sounds so simple, I know.  Buy low, sell high.  My exact thoughts were, "How hard can it be?" It is not so simple because once you are in the moment trying to guess what is going to happen next you realise how little control influence you have on it.  You want/expect it to go down and it goes up.  You want/expect it to go up and it goes down.  It is actually a lot more unpredictable and uncooperative than you would hope.
After my experiment I learned that hodling is the best bet and to just by in during perceived "dips."  It is literal gambling and I don't think the risk/reward is worth it. I can't see it being my more profitable than just holding the line.  Even if you don't end up in the hole, you wont be as far ahead as you would be without trying to day trade.  
Maybe other people have had success getting a few extra coins this way, but I image in the big picture it isn't worth day trading in such and impossibly volatile market.   
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:06
I have never sold my coin and I have no intention of selling my holdings.  You don't know anything about me or how long I have held or what I do in bitcoin.  
You have made all kinds of erroneous and idiotic assumptions about me.   
The one thing we both know is that there are over 280000 unconfirmed transactions as of last night and the average transaction is costing $40 USD and you are trying to tell me everything is fine and it is my fault?
You sir, with all due respect, are presumptuous and an idiot.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:14
You should go fuck yourself for not admitting that a 'cash system" as it is described in the white paper that has fees that are higher than the value of what is being purchased and having to wait hours and days for a transaction to confirm is fundamentally flawed and that has nothing to do with the price of Bitcoin or when I bought in and I am not panicking.  I could give two shits.  I have more important things to deal with than arguing about crypto and making gains in crypto.  It could fall to one cent and my life would be exactly the same as it is now. I am not reduced to defending a currently broken system and being a jackass to people on reddit over my baseless assumptions and froathing rabid cultlike support.  It is like Bitcoin is the retarded child of some of these people, and you have to pretend it's normal like all the other kids so the parents don't get offended.  It's ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with a little criticism, it can be constructive.  You are already assuming I am some kind of BCash supporter, I am not.  I have never held any and don't plan on it.

Everyone can access it but no one can afford to move it, or has the time to wait for transaction to confirm.  You just access it and it kind of sits around.  Think of it like the furniture with plastic on it at Grandma's house that you can't even sit on.  Ya.  Good stuff.  Very very valuable.

That is kind of what I settled on as well.  I don't have quite enough to really sweat about them not being 1000% secure.  On one hand you can never be too careful but on the other hand I think people get a little carried away with going overboard.  I think there is a certain point where you can get a little carried away piling on security measures when what you are using is sufficient for the task at hand. 
I would never advise someone that a software wallet is "good enough" because there are the vulnerabilities, but at the end of the day, in some applications...it is "good enough"       
From this point forward my accumulated and bought coins go to my Ledger.  
I am going to wait a bit, and see what happens.  I will probably end up just lowering my fees a bit, and giving it a whirl at some point.  
If you learn anything or do end up moving your coins to your Ledger successfully let me know how your experience was, and what fees you set and all that.

This was definitely the vision Satoshi had in mind according to You can't even suggest that insanely high prohibitive fees and transactions that hang indefinitely might possibly be a problem for what was introduced as a "cash" system.  Nope.  Suddenly you are a BTrash supporting newbie who doesn't know about hodl.  It's ridiculous. No discourse or discussion or anything.  Just sit around and shout "hodl hodl hodl" at your problem.

No.  Your coins exist on the global blockchain.  
So long as you hang on to your private keys or your seed somehow (memory) you can use or restore your keys anywhere in the world.  
It will be very difficult for governments to flat out ban bitcoin entirely, but for the sake of argument, if they somehow do, and you have your key info even if you memorise it, you could travel to a country where it isn't banned and use it there however you please.
They government could take away everything I own, throw me in jail and ban me from ever using the internet, I could still "own" the seed and those coins in the bitcoin network can only be accessed by me or whoever I give the keys too. 
Long story short.  Your coins can't be confiscated, or banned by a single government.

Call me crazy, but I don't really think bitcoin has been riding on the back Steam. Do we really think that bitcoin transactions on Steam are what has driven up the value? My guess is the number of bitcoin purchases on steam were almost completely insignificant as far as Steams business is concerned, and as far as bitcoin is concerned an infinitesimal small blip in the bitcoin ecosystem.  
I think it is wise for them to put it on hold for the time being because I think accepting bitcoin as payment in these crazy days of growth and high fees hurt its credibility.  There are people that will have a bad taste in their mouth, "I bought a 20 dollar game 6 months ago for what would be 100 bucks today."  It will turn off the casual consumer. 
I am all for a future where bitcoin is more stable and can is used as a form of payment.  I have purchased with it.  I support it 100% and see that in the future.  It is crazy to do it now.  I think Steam is making a wise move for their own sake, the sake of their customer, and for the sake of bitcoin.  
 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:51
I believe you are incorrect because bitcoin was not brought into existence as form of lottery for people to get rich out of thin air. 
Yes, as with any technology people will use it for means other than it is intended but I believe as time goes and it continues to come into its own it will be the philosophy, technology and the infrastructure that stabilises and becomes ubiquitous. 
I think there are many folks myself included who are not interested in massive profits and becoming an over night billionaire.  I certainly wouldn't complain should that happen, but I am not banking on it.  In fact I would be perfectly happy if its value remained right where it was and it became the most prominent form of currency exchange.  
Bitcoins initial promise wasn't that of fortunes and a lottery.  It is a peer to peer, decentralized currency free of centralized banks and government.  That promise is a promise of a societal wealth, liberty and freedom that I think will continue to find its purpose and value as an economic infrastructure and not be reduced to the useful idiots posting selfies with lambos and hash tagging 
The thing you are missing is that it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of it or how they use it.  It doesn't change what it actually is.  That is worth a lot and it will be tough to kill off.
As pointed out, its already been down that road a few times and what doesn't kill it, seems to make it stronger.  I think we can consider these times character building and we are witnessing the true value of it increase, it doesn't matter how many zeros and $s you put up on a board.

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:04:05
Kind of taking what I said out of context.  Valve explained pretty clearly that using bitcoin was bad for business and gave their sound reasons.  If using a method of payment by the very nature of it (transaction fees are too high for example) is bad for business, that is bad for for whatever method of payment.  
Like a credit card with fees set to high.  A handful of people determined to use that credit card come hell or high water aren't really helping the cause.  Eventually businesses will say, "to hell with this, we are not accepting the card we have to pay an extra 35%" doesn't make any sense. So yes, when looked at this way, it is bad for bitcoin to expect people to use it as a form of payment in a climate that is volatile and bad for business.   
I know that doesn't fit the utopia we are all envisioning for bitcoin down the road, but we aren't down the road yet.
I do believe bitcoin will stabilize and become a credible form of payment.  To expect it to be already there presently is a little bit far fetched, and I think will generally frustrate merchants and consumers.

My advice: DONT! I was one of the idiots who thought, "How hard can it be? Just buy low and sell high?"  When you are actually in the thick of it, it is a major headache.  The market is so impossibly unpredictable and it never cooperates. You will sell and then it goes up another $1000 and then you are stuck with USD in hand wondering "Now what?" then you get impatient waiting for a major drop down below where you were, if that ever even ends up happening. Even if you don't end up losing, you will end up further behind than if you just hodled. That is almost guaranteed. My advice is to just buy in during your perceived dips, even that is rather difficult to time properly.  Day trading will almost certainly end up with the price of bitcoin taking off on you with USD in hand and you wishing that you hodled.      
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:35:41
I made made paper wallets.  Funded my nTrust account no fees, then sent twenty dollars worth in fiat at the time I did it to the various paper address I made.  The whole process has no fees and you just have to deal with the slightly wonky nTrust exchange rate.
In other words if you are doing a few hundred dollars worth it you might get short changed a couple of bucks compared to other exchanges.   Personally the zero fee makes up for it and then some and they have amazing customer service.  
Mileage may very.  Good luck and Merry Christmas

Yes, I am planning on doing this for my kids.  Using it as a bit of a teachable moment to.  I am thinking of doing them some custom designed bitcoin "bank notes" that they can use to transfer 25 bucks or something into their own wallets.  I am considering doing them USB wallets, or maybe just paper.  
I want to use it as a way to teach them about the technology. The concept of block chain, markets, investment, cryptocurrency.  Then show them how they can look up online how much they currently hold in bitcoin and what the current market value is.  
My thinking is it will be a really neat way to introduce them to some technologies that will surely shape our future one way or another and who knows what interest it might spark?  
I know it isn't the most kid friendly gift idea, as far as the instant satisfaction.  In a way its kind of like giving a savings bond, "Here sweetie have a piece of paper that you cant buy toys with" but I think as it goes they will get something out of the familiarity with cryptocurrency.  They can use it to maybe buy dlc for their video games.  
If anyone has any ideas about gifting bitcoin, please share!

I don't trust them with my money for the exact same reasons you wouldn't trust me with your money.
That and the MTGOX incident.

I am a little confused because you aren't speaking a form of Canadian that I am familiar with.  
No, it isn't very likely that coinbase will enable selling for Canadians.  Get your Bitcoin into a wallet or onto a Canadian exchange if you want to sell it, but if you only have $100 worth I wouldn't be too worried about selling for some time (especially for a "bit of profit")
I can't say for sure, but you will probably want to hodl for a while, you bought in at all time highs, you may see a loss before a profit.  There isn't quite a "very casual" level of Bitcoin yet and as a Canadian with the exchange and the fees and the lack of ability to sell, I have found coinbase is a bit of a pain in the arse to be honest.  I've used it, and I don't hate it, but it isn't I would say the easiest starting point especially for Canadian's.  The easy part is signing up.  You need to educate yourself at least to some level of degree.  Learn up about paper/software/hardware wallets and sign up for a Canadian exchange (try QuadrigaCX), or perhaps the absolute easiest I have found with no fuss at all is nTrust, also Canadian.  They only deal in Bitcoin as far as crypto goes but they will be expanding that.  Quick sign up, pretty easy to move CAD around, no fees, they accept debit, and customer service is excellent.  I would say they are leaps and bounds more approachable for a beginner than coinbase is.

It is like worrying that a nuke capable of wiping out every single living organism on earth may put your bitcoin address in jeopardy.

This keeps getting brought up.  
Wouldn't the security strength of bitcoin be the absolute least of our worries once computers become that powerful? The digital security of literally everything will be compromised.  If there is computing power that can hack massive corporations, central banks, and governments, I would imagine my paltry little bitcoin hodl will already be worthless anyways as the world spirals into complete anarchy.

Canada's most widely circulated/read newspaper. Unfortunately not particularly Bitcoin related, but cool exposure, no less.

Think about P2P torrent technology and how freely pirated movies have been shared over the internet for 15 years and how much money has been spent trying to stop it and prosecute it?
Now ask yourself,  "If there was simply a switch you could flick on the internet...wouldn't the government have done that by now?"
Simply put only parts of the internet are controlled and at all different levels.  No one has enough independent control prevent people from just going around whatever they are doing.  Unless you live in a country like North Korea that controls all access for all citizens.  At that point you have bigger problems than Bitcoin, and that doesn't effect Bitcoin users elsewhere around the world, even slightly.  It just exists around the bubble.  Like it already does.

No shit, it isn't legal tender anywhere.  That's kind of the POINT!
Piss off with this garbage

You know what would be even better?  Absolutely NO centralized third party institutions. They are completely unnecessary and defeat the whole purpose of crypto, in my opinion and my interpretation of the white paper

The million satoshi question is which Android wallet supports the Ledger Nano S and SegWit addresses?  I know Samouri is working on Trezor support which is amazing, but I need some Ledger support.  It is a pity Electrum doesn't have it baked into the Android wallet because it is mint on the desktop application.

From the fucking article,
"But to assume so enormous an increase requires faith not only in the superior cost efficiency of the technology but also in the absence of any effective competition." 
Uhhh, ya morons. Thats exactly the point.  People do have faith in the cost efficiency and the value of removing an outside third party, and there is no real effective competition...I will throw a 'yet' in there for good measure.  So according to yourselves,  there is a reason it is worth 1000 times your $20 mark?  
Thanks for wasting everyone's time with this.  Totally pointless.  
"Humans should all be dead. Life is over valued. There is no explanation for humans being alive.  There should only be death.  They only way that there could be life is if there is oxygen and water."
Brilliant insight!

The announcements mention having watch only addresses, so as usual, Apple users will enjoy at least some of the functionality of an Android.
Can you not use OTG dongles with Apple?  That really sucks.  Never once in the past 11 years have I even wished I had an iPhone instead of whatever device I was using at the time.

I quite drinking last April and started putting that money into Bitcoin last October and I must say...I am sitting fairly pretty 
This is fine

...because of the "almighty" fiat
This is the obvious pushback from traditional banking institutions and governments to control the flow between fiat and bitcoin which is a necessary evil in the evolution of crypto at this point.  Sprinkle in a little bit of corporate greed (FEES!!!!) and you have all the makings of exactly where we are today.    
There isn't much stopping us from going around the exchanges and transacting bitcoin to fiat directly person to person, but that really does take a certain amount of organization, and a lot of effort to make sure we don't get ourselves scammed.  
So the silver lining to the big exchanges, is they do that heavy lifting to keep the flow of crypto "honest" and in a way that protects the integrity of it because it is more difficult for people to go rogue in that ecosystem.  
I don't particularly like the big exchanges but there is something to be said for what they are doing to help go mainstream, and increase adoption of the technology.  I hope we do get away from the centralized nature of them, but it could be worse.  
They are still private business that are, I hope, operating under the law and hopefully not under the law makers, and they are separate from financial institutions.  Having to work with them, not for or under them.
