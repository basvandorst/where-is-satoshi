I'll say this again, NXT was one of the few coins who is still gained even through all this.... fork is coming in a few days:
Nice comment from Tradingview.com:
As I wrote before, people on Twitter and Reddit are talking about NXT mooning to 20-30k Satoshi till 28 Dec :) IGNIS is technologically very interesting and has huge potential for 2018! Airdrop is supported from most of exchanges (people are not forced to use official NXT wallet) IGNIS will be credited when NXT will be held on supported exchange 28 December (supported exchanges are Bittrex, Poloniex, HitBTC etc.) and its the last chance how to get IGNIS and free from this airdrop! Another 50% of IGNIS was sold during presale ICO....IGNIS will have very solid market cap when goes live and will start trading 1.1.2018! These fundaments are seriously huge, NXT will start MOONING very soon....HODL NXT!
From JakeTheCryptoKing:
I've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.
The math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.
I do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.
Others from this thread:
I just converted all my coins on Bittrex to NXT. Every single one. Paid a shit ton in exchange fees, but I think it will ultimately be worth it. I have about 5k coins, so if I get 2500 IGNIS, that's about $6,250 in free money. That's close to my entire crypto investment.
