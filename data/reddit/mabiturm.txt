No country will accept bitcoin as the national currency because there's no way for banking in bitcoin. If banks cannot create money in the local currency, theres no business and the economy will collapse.
Also with the built in relation between adoption and deflation, cotizens would not spend their money but keep it in their pocket.
The maximum adoption that could happen in this field is adoption of bitcoin as new new standard, like the gold was a standard untill the 70's. There were good reasons to move to a new system though, it would be a step back.

Miners closing down has nothing to do with the amount of coins left. It only has to do with the difficulty, the price of BTC and the block reward. the last one will stay the same for another 3,5 years, and while the first two follow one another up, there is no reason to close down a mining business.

I'm with you in this one. We're not at a peak, we barely reached the previous ATH and now start losing momentum again. Peaks used to be a 10-fold of the last peak. Meanwhile other coins are showing the old bitcoin patterns.

Bitcoinwisdom shows a 504 block average hashrate. So the bump must show up later in their charts.

90% beer, 10% transaction costs

I just paid 2 dollars for a transaction

Why is there no 4th option: BU and SW ?

Bitcoin has a valuable place in the market, but I don't expect big volatility soon. Which might actually be a positive thing, bitcoin is finally getting mature.
I sold most most of my bitcoin, it has been very profitable so far.

in Segwit, blocksize grows to about 1.7 mb if I'm right. There will still be fees. How does this serve the microtransaction infrastructure? or am I missing a functionality of segwit?

clevercoin.com is Dutch and charges 0.3% to buy btc. Depositing euros is free, and withdrawal to you bank costs €0.70.
I'm pretty satisfied with them so far.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:36:33
Do they have an advantage in luck? They don't have to deal with all transactions and can just start calculating a new block right after the previous comes in. It's probably only a difference in milliseconds.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:03:44
that might be right, but segwit != lightning. We're still lightyears away from lightning.
I don't get why we don't do both, 2mb AND segwit. Now is a critica time with other coins catching up
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:50:22
No, SegWit only seperates the witness part from the transaction part of a block. It increases the blocksize a bit, but doesn't double. It is a good thing, don't get me wrong. SegWit helps scaling. It helps, but it does not solve the current problem with transaction costs. 
I paid 2 dollars in transaction costs two days ago at the peak in network traffic. thats ridiculous.
Lightning is a great solution for micropayments, but it is not a solution for p2p payment, it makes a single transaction double as expensive (1 transaction to open a lightning channel, 1 to close it).
We are in a critical time for bitcoin and should adopt all real solutions for the current problems. segwit AND lightning AND bigger blocks AND every other real solution.
bitcoin's dominance dropped to the lowest ever this week (70%), now it the time to act, before technically more advanced coins take over. eg.: Ethereum is presenting Raiden, their lightning solution, in a few weeks from now.

Maybe its a liftoff for the american hodlers, for the europeans its a pretty steady day. We're just looking at the dollar-rocket slowing down.

I'm not so sure about this. After Trump takes office his politics might actually turn out not as bad as they seem now. Focus on local economy and jobs might actually make the dollar stronger.
Also, the current dollar price probably has the risk of a trump-disaster calculated in.

Money well spent :) Hope to celebrate with you tomorrow!

Now pay for a coffee with bitcoin. Then that 30 cents is suddenly expensive. Be careful, pretending that there is no problem makes it worse.
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:34:39
Did I mention the blocksize anywhere? This is a very important discussion, please don't limit it too the 1mb or 2mb discussion. 
What is future of bitcoin, will it be a low-cost currency and payment system or a commodity with a smaller market and higher fees?
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:29:14
Exactly what I'm used to. In europe bitcoin is in direct competition with free bank wire transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:47:03
Bitcoin has huge potential for inhabitants of countries with instable economies. 30 cents is too much for them.
Bitcoin is the best invention in finance since the credit card, only now it's not affordable enough for day to day expenses. Don't ignore that. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:30:23
what do you mean with 'datacenter financial tool'? The whole point of bitcoin is that it's independent of third parties. 
What is the future of bitcoin that you're hoping for? Just curious. All I see now is a flaw that makes bitcoin unpractical for normal use, but it seems you that see a different role for bitcoin in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:04:26
exactly, thats why this theory is wrong. correlation does not imply causation.  There might be a relation between price and block reward, but there are many more factors that influence the price.
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:12:48
There are only limited ETC on the market. Most are lost, unclaimable or forgotten. Thats why also the market cap is not comparable to the ETH cap or other alts caps
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:36:42
This! Ethereum will crash/correct, but At a higher market cap than bitcoin will be at
