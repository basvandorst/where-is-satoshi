lol insider trading before the announcement those bastards

ok so what exactly happened to all the coins? From my limited understanding are they saying a malleability hack changed the addresses of the recipients and the coins are in a wallet address that doesn't belong to anyone? 
Or did the "hacker" change the address to one that they own? or did Karpeles just do a runner with everyone's coins and money?

companies take preorders of mining rigs then using that money they build the mining rig and use it themselves to mine coins. After some time (several months) they then ship you the mining rig that you paid for. 
So not only did they earn coins for themselves using your rig but they also earned from your purchase.

it's the user's first post, kinda makes me wonder if this is just another FUD. Plus that screenshot has so little info. 
Keep us updated if this is legit.

still looks pretty smug for a guy who's supposedly apologizing
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:22:34
read the latest wall street journal interview that karpeles did. The bastard says "it's confidential"

lol you need to proof read and rewrite that petition it sounds like an angry 15 year old wrote it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:50
sorry but this made me laugh
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:57:05
how do you explain the price on Huobi then? Huobi is pretty much the largest bitcoin exchange in terms of daily volume but their price is similar to btce
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:02:51
it's a ddos they said so on their twitter account. Bitstamp is ok for me
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:16:00
we did when bitstamp resumed btc withdrawals but the mt gox issue is still making everyone wary thus driving the prices down
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:12:21
should be "affected"... I'll just leave this here and go
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:28:03
yeah i believe they gave that guy a job after that he's in charge of the machine now i think
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:20:41
the problem is they never answered whether or not they still have everyone's bitcoin. If they just included that in their press release to ease everyone's minds then the price wouldn't have plunged the way it has. 
I think they purposely didn't say anything so they could buy cheap bitcoins and sell them on another exchange for a higher price plus the transaction fees they get from all the panic selling.  That's what I would've done to earn a lot of money even if they still had everyone's money. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:27:52
you can use exchanges like bitstamp or btce they don't require a us bank account
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:52:19
do they allow btc to cash withdrawals? and what's the fee?
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:47:19
white and male? has she ever heard of btc china and huobi? Just looking at their daily btc volume it's pretty obvious who owns majority of bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:29:07
tell them that they're harassing you with these questions as it's YOUR money and that you'll move your business to a different bank. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:55:01
I've been using them since early Dec. was scared at first as well, but everything seems straight up with them. 
Managed to deposit cash, coins and withdraw coins from them without any hitch. 
Their support may seem lacking though, since they're not very good at english but so far they've responded within an acceptable time frame in my experience.
But like everyone says don't keep coins on exchanges unless you day trade. 
They may seem shady but Mt Gox wasn't anonymous nor was Neo &amp; Bee and look at what happened to those two. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:58:57
i know there's a bar that accepts bitcoins near raffles 
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:05:16
So far Btc-e has been pretty trustworthy. I haven't experienced anything for me to doubt them. 
It's a well known fact that their support could be a lot better but yeah, no one really knows who owns it or even where exactly they're based.
But I agree unless you're day trading don't ever leave any coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:57:52
Kinda makes me want to stand next to the machine and trade btc for cash with no fee when the market becomes higher
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:02:19
I think you guys are missing the point. Mt Gox was well known. Everyone knew who the CEO was and where they were located but that didn't stop them from screwing everyone over. 
ANY exchange can make a run for it with your money. There is absolutely no exchange that you can be 100% sure of. 
If you don't hold the private keys to your coins then you don't own them and there will always be a risk. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:03:23
you win!!
