A. No, real value is commonly overestimated by markets, this is called a BUBBLE. 
B. It isn't priceless, if you think the value of bitcoin is going up, then every bitcoin you spend is worth whatever future value you could've gained by holding it. Essentially, you're a fucking moron if you spend your bitcoin. A currency that you CAN but DONT WANT to spend is USELESS and has NO VALUE as a currency because of the liquidity trap it creates. There is a functioning bitcoin MARKET but there is by no stretch a functioning bitcoin ECONOMY. Do you know the difference??? Try Wikipedia.
C. Wow did they send you a tin foil hat in the mail for believing that theory? 
D. You really think non fiat currency is new? Hahahahahahhahhahahahahahhahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaah ok I'm talking to a twelve year old wow.

haha wow dude you would've made a great 60's hippie.  you need regulation surrounding the supply of a currency to guarantee that my value won't be destroyed by the owners flooding the market with new bitcoins. bitcoin chose to solve this problem by making it non-inflationary. this was a poor design choice for a currency. 
anybody who chooses to use bitcoin as a currency is an idiot, desperate or a criminal.  Pretty simple.  you should only rationally sell bitcoin for goods and services when you HAVE to (crime, out of money) or else you're better off holding onto it since you get more value. 
maybe it would be successful.  but the only way I'd ever implement such a currency is if it were 100% traceable and had no means of being anonymous. I don't see how this can be achieved.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:05:37

@_date: 2014-03-23 18:40:27
Because the euro is regulated. The reason bitcoin was made non inflationary in the first place was to ensure people that the market wouldn't just be flooded with them if they got valuable. 
Decentralization and adoption are 100% at odds. You need regulation surrounding a currency.
I propose pinning the supply to something regulated as a compromise between being decentralized and unregulated.

God you people are fucking stupid. You don't even realize the idiocy of a statement that you're expecting to hold onto a currency for years and expecting it to be more valuable in that few years. You all think the same thing and don't understand how the two are mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:00:03
That paper doesn't really make any sense. Maybe there's a reason it isn't published? the very issue with a non-inflationary currency is that people depends on people's willingness to save it.  
That "paper" put out by a pretend research laboratory designed to spread bitcoin propaganda makes a lot of bold claims, and ignores the question of why would a rational consumer spend bitcoin rather than fiat on a gallon of milk if next week the bitcoin will be worth 2 gallons of milk and the fiat will be worth the same? this creates the liquidity trap.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:23:35
the design flaw is a non inflationary currency isn't useful for spending because it's more useful as an investment vehicle when the price is increasing, its more akin to gold than money.  However, in one particular circumstance (crime), bitcoins anonymity gives it a rare usefulness as currency. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:37:02
lol you're cute.
I've already stated my argument. fixed supply currencies are ineffective as currencies because they are better saved than spent.  Economies rely on spending.

Yea I worked on the biggest derivatives desk in the world for years. But keep talking you fucking moron.
Thanks for the primer on fucking inflation. Clearly my comment went over your tiny little adorable head. I'm not sure you'll understand this but lets give it a go. This "real value" you're referring to of bitcoin as a currency only exists if people actually use it as a currency. Now if everyone is sitting their holdin on to it, who exactly is creating the currency value by spending it? Do you see now why deflationary currencies are a bad thing? Was that simple enough for you? Maybe now you get why every developed economy uses an inflationary currency?

If you invest in bitcoin you're profiteering off child abuse. 
The number one non investment uses of bitcoin are money laundering and child porn. Remember where your money comes from. Hope abused children are worth it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:19:29
How many times do I have to say this before you understand it? Cash requires physical transfer. This makes it impractical for something like kiddy porn which is fully digital. And makes transacting in illegal activity much more difficult and risky. It also makes it much more difficult for the receiver to actually use the money because any significant amount of national currency that you gain as income must be accounted for and taxed. This cannot be done in large amounts without extensive laundering operations, further increasing risk, bitcoin does not require this and is easily converted for everyday use. Also cash is mostly used for legitimate purposes whereas bitcoins primary use is criminal. Physical currency will only exist as long as it has to. We are fast approaching the point where physical money is obsolete.
Keep rationalizing your decision to enable child abuse.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:31:50
yes, yes it does say something about bitcoin's design, it says that the decision to be non-inflationary was a bad one because people who hold it don't want to spend it.  A currency that you don't want to spend is poorly designed.

Btw this dude who uses Bitcoin to transfer funds is going to get royally fucked. Currency trading with traditional currencies is coded in assembly languages and uses the most sophisticated and expensive cables because speed kills. The extra steps of having to go to transfer to Bitcoin (one block chain visit) move the coins (2nd visit) and then back to the real currency (3rd visit), all of traditional Internet, will absolutely butt rape this dude. Absolute insanity taking exposure to 3 fucking currencies, one of them being the most volatile currency in human history, in one SLOW as fuck trade.

You cannot hedge Bitcoin fluctuation risk through hedging other currencies or other assets. It mathematically is impossible since it has 0 corollaries. Please tell me, a derivatives trader, which financial instrument you would buy to hedge your Bitcoin risk since you know so much? Give me one viable strategy and I'll delete my account.
Also, rebit didn't exist until Bitcoin was near its peak. So from their perspective it has only dropped big time.
Saying something has increased 1000% without mentioning that it started out being worth about 10 cents is intellectually retarded.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:39:39
It takes putting your coins into a tumbler and nothing else to be anonymous. It's quite easy.
You don't know a damn thing about hedging or what you need to be able to hedge. You need a developed derivatives market. Bitcoin only has an extremely illiquid futures market that is almost impossible to buy on and is unregulated and thus more risky than bitcoins themselves. Massive credit exposure. No credit market. No other assets correlated to Bitcoin, no options, no repo, no swaps.
that's the most infantile definition of risk premium I've ever heard. It has nothing to do with charging. It's actually a term for the greater gains you expect from taking on more risk. Rebit is indeed collecting their risk premium from taking on risk in the form of a im guessing large transaction fee.

non counterfeitable, divisible, transportable, are all characteristics of MONEY. not currency. I could devise any billions of systems that meet these requirements.
CURRENCY however, requires stability, recognized as valuable and backed by a legitimate authority.
bitcoin fails every single one of these tests.  it is incredibly unstable. only recognized as valuable by an extremely small subset of the population (less than 1% of people hold any amount of bitcoin), and the blockchain is explicitly not a central authority, on the website itself, it states they are not a governing authority over bitcoin. not to mention it has 0 authority.
1. I would expect far less volatility
2. i would expect to be able to purchase bare necessities with it
3. yes they are, they cater to xbox gamers only. not to mention they come through a third party that charges a fee, they wouldn't even count as part of gdp being second hand sales.
4. all of bitcoins real value comes from its use as a black market currency, the primary market is kiddie porn. you profit off of and support child pornography by using bitcoin.

it solves a bunch of problems that don't exist.
it is proof that this doesnt work

Im not a compsci person, I'm an Econ person, and what I know is that bitcoin has 0 future as a currency. Maybe it has alternate applications, sure. However as an unregulated, anonymous and non-government, medium of exchange, it has none. 
Same way you enforce other laws against digital content?? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:30:45
Well considering this thread referenced r/economics, don't you think it's likely that were talking about bitcoin as a currency/store of wealth rather than any other application?
I'm all on board with it being a break through. I yield to your expertise in that area, sounds awesome. However, believe me when I say it will never function as a currency. 
And enforcement wouldn't matter because simply making it illegal removes its usefulness as a currency. It prevents legitimate businesses from accepting it, so it only becomes useful for anonymous illegal purchases. It loses all value as a store of wealth as well for legitimate investors. It's the risk of potentially being thrown in jail for owning bitcoin as well as the risk of your illegal purchase. Economics would enforce the law.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:36:11
The issue is that if it ever does catch on with the masses and becomes more than a store of wealth as it is now, it will start to see heavy government blowback if the powers that be begin to see it as a legitimate threat to their own currencies. Bitcoin could be legislated out of existence in months.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:35:46
sure.  The first thing to keep in mind is that currently, calling bitcoin a currency is a lot like calling gold a currency.  You can readily exchange it to get money for goods and services, but you very rarely actually exchange it for goods and services.  It is also very similar to gold in that people treat it like a store of wealth or an investment.  It is again similar to gold in that most of its value comes from people thinking it has value more than anything else (gold does have industrial uses and looks good in jewelry, but the bulk of its value comes from its historic use as a store of wealth).  So, while its interesting as a store of wealth, it is basically useless as a currency in the modern world.  It offers consumers no real advantage over traditional currency (unless they're doing something illegal).  Sure you can theoretically transfer wealth to someone else cheaper/easier, but its also far more risky since the $100 you sent could easily be $80 by morning.  It may be cheaper for merchants, but why do consumers care? The difference to online merchants would be pennies per order, so as a consumer, why would I take the extra steps of purchasing bitcoins to complete a transaction when I easily could have just spent a few cents more to use far easier traditional currency?  The real problem with it as a currency is that it is competing with regular currency, which just has way too much of an advantage to be beaten.  
Eventually the secret is gona get out that bitcoin isn't useful as a currency, and people will realize that they're using strings of code as an investment vehicle and bail the fuck out.  Bitcoin is back to being worth pennies by 2020.  
Even if it did catch on as a currency somehow, there is the problem that governments wouldn't take a serious threat to their own currencies lightly.  People would raise big stinks about how its anonymous and could be used to fund terrorism and kiddie porn, it wouldn't be tough to outlaw.  And its usefulness and value dissappears just by virtue of it being illegal.  I don't need a 3rd party in order to watch a pirated movie.  I just need me and the site I download from.  For illegal bitcoins, I need a vendor who is willing to accept my illegal currency.  Only illegal vendors would participate in this, and the prices would be astronomical due to the risk.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:51:00
Haha if it's illegal to buy bitcoin in major markets it will die. Are you serious?
