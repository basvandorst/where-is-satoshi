The point of it wouldnt be the bailout. You guys all need to see past the exact figures and just look at what this is doing to the image of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

I never once said Mark Karpeles isn't evil. Thats my point, actually. He looks evil in the latest interview he released (in japan). Why wouldn't the central banksters just pay him an enormous sum to do what he is doing? Its obvious no fucks are given (on Mark Karpeles's end). 
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:40:25

"And then you start dreaming about how you're gonna make a profit by mining it and you talk about "market cap" and then you go on about Ayn Rand and how the banks are screwing you over and to all of this I say whogivesaFUCK."

Weev is Epic. Send him some Crypto Love. His BTC address is in his PasteBin letter (linked) this is his
DOGE address :
You can confirm it on his twitter  | 
"My current market-determined hourly rate is 1 Bitcoin an hour. I was taken from my childhood home at gunpoint on January 18th, 2011, and I was not allowed to freely exercise my liberties as a citizen until April 11th, 2014. That's 1179 days that you used my time that I am now billing you for (I gave you a discount by not including the last day). I am owed 28,296 Bitcoins. I do not accept United States dollars, as it is the preferred currency of criminal organizations such as the FBI, DOJ, ATF, and Federal Reserve and I do not assist criminal racketeering enterprises."
