From glancing at the Mycelium documentation it appears that you can get a backup of your wallet as a seed phrase: 
- Move your BTC holdings to a different wallet with a new seed phrase first.
- Then you can import your old walled seed phrase into Electron Cash and get access to your BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:00:48
I was able to use Electron Cash to sweep my BCH from all of the private keys that I hold. **Electron Cash is not to be trusted**, so I first moved all of my BTC from their location at the fork to brand new paper wallets.
I created a new user account on my computer and installed Electron Cash. From there it's just `Wallet -&gt; Private keys -&gt; Sweep`.
After one block of BCash was mined I was able to send my BCH to ViaBTC. After one confirmation there, I was able to trade my BCH for BTC.
I also sent some of my BCH to Bittrex because the exchange rate is currently better, but Bittrex requires 20 block confirmations vs 1 at ViaBTC so I'm still waiting on that one.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:35:18
If you moved BTC into a wallet, it is already associated with a private key. The method of extracting that key varies according to which wallet software you are using.
If there was BTC in the wallet *during* the chain split on August 1st, than the private key for that wallet contains an equal amount of BCH as there was BTC in the wallet at the split.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:39:18
I created a new user account on my computer for Electron Cash. I did not use a completely different computer, but then again, I don't use Electrum.

You're underestimating. Wages have gone up by more than 6x in the same time period according to [Average Indexed Monthly Earnings]( Even the federal minimum wage is over 4x what it was in 1972.
Minimum wage work per burger:
- 1972: 10.5 minutes/burger
- 2017: 7.4 minutes/burger

Move them to a software, hardware or paper wallet(s). If you do not hold your private keys, you do not hold Bitcoin.

I heard some guy on cable claim that there are only about 300,000 holders of $5k+ worth of Bitcoin.
I have no idea who he is or where he got that info so take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:32:39
Fair enough. Mt Gox was amateur hour for sure, but for cold storage I'll always prefer paper. If I don't hold the private key I don't hold the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:56:27
Coinbase just breached $2000 and kept going. $2007 as I type this.

First of all, there's plenty of counterparty risk involved in insurance policies. Secondly:


That's the exact same amount of insurance I carry on my paper wallets! Stop giving bad advice.

You're missing the point. Bitcoin is about freedom. When you give away the control of your money, you give away your freedom. You have no control of anything. All you can do is ask permission of the money holder. What if war breaks out and the US government declares martial law and tanks roll up on Coinbase HQ? Where's your Bitcoin? If you don't own the private key you don't own the Bitcoin, and you are servile to those who do.

Not for a 5 year old, but here are a few highlights:
Dogecoin is a fork of Luckycoin which is itself a fork of Litecoin. Unlike Bitcoin it is inflationary, although it wasn't always. Originally there were 100 billion coins scheduled to be minted but this was later adjusted so that there is a 10,000 coin reward for finding blocks forever (after the 600,000th block, which was mined a long time ago).
Dogecoin supports merged mining with Litecoin. That is, when you mine Litecoin you can simultaneously mine Dogecoin using the same guesses for each blockchain. Again, this was not always the case.
The block generation time is only minute which means that on-blockchain transactions are verified relatively quickly when compared to Bitcoin.
Dogecoin was a joke, but it caught on. It was arguably the first cryptocurrency to gain any real world outside of the crypto/tech community, with redditors using it to throw pennies at each other.
It also sponsored a NASCAR team, the Jamaican Olympic bobsled team, a big water fundraising effort in Kenya and has also attracted it's fair share of scammers and thieves.

Ever heard of Mt Gox? While I am relatively confident that Coinbase is being run with the best of intentions, and with far more competence than Mt Gox ever was, that doesn't guarantee that they won't screw up or get robbed.
Breadwallet is fine for walking around money. I prefer paper wallets for long term storage.

Keep your BTC in your Trezor and use your recovery seed with a BCC wallet.

Sorry but I'm unfamiliar with "Bitcoin accelerators". After some cursory Googling I'm going to have to say that I'm too ignorant to provide a satisfactory answer. Hopefully somebody else can give you a bit more insight, sorry.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:38:38
Counterparty risk bro! In all seriousness though, you don't hold the private key for the BTC that Coinbase is holding on your behalf, so if they lose it or steal it, you're SOL. However, holding your BTC in your Bitcoin Core wallet is not without it's own risks. Perhaps take a few minutes to polish up on [wallet security](

To those who think this is some sort of conspiracy, I'd like to remind you that the API is still up and running. Just download the app you whiny little bitches.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:19:11


And to do that you import your private key into a wallet that follows the Bitcoin Cash chain. The easiest way is by using the recovery seed.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:25:50
So just download the app.
