Just wait until you start trading and you lose 4 bitcoins in 20 minutes only to make 8 the next 20 minutes. 
I'm starting to go crazy. 
Damn you alt coins!

Why are people having problems? I've been with them for years and never had a problem.

That's so 2 minutes ago...Gox almost at 900...
Welcome to BTC
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:29:42
Well knowing bitcoin this is how it will preform this year.
1245 &gt; 780 &gt; 2000&gt; 6000&gt; 900 &gt; 100,000 &gt; 100 &gt; and at the end of the year settle right at 3000

Just saying it was common knowledge on BTC-E and crypto whales that this was going to happen. 
Not my fault there is a dangerous amount of dumb money in this sector. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:01:01
I will admit I've done it. If a trade goes bad I'll trade 4 btc from BTC-E to Mt-Gox for around 40 dollars per BTC then withdraw it from MT Gox to my back account. It takes a few days but it's easy money.

I hate that word. "invest" 
Most useless word in the stock market. 
Make money don't invest. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:31:42
That is the coolest thing I've ever seen. O_O
It's happening! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:40:44
Maybe Bitcoin wallets. But blind people can use a seeing eye Doge to read Dogecoin wallets!

Ding Ding Ding. 
People who aren't whales don't understand. I had to sell my BTC on BTC-E from 880-950s. I bought in more in the 500s and resold from 700 all the way up to 800s. After that there was no play until this little DDOS plan went through. Under 500 was the price target for us, now we are starting to fill back in so you're seeing a rise. Yes it will cont. to rise and fall around 500 as we fill in our position and wait for the bad news to lift and the DDOS attacks stop. 
After that we will begin pumping it to 600-700 and the normals will do the rest up to 1000 then we dump again from 800s-900s. 
Enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:12:53
There is actually a plan on cryptowhales to where they pump BTC up to 1k-3k Then crash the market while simultaneously DDOS the exchanges. Then bring them online and buy all the cheap coins. 
It's going to happen some time. 
Welcome to bitcoin.

I'm sure speculating. I'm trying to see this as the plane at kitty hawk and imagining the shuttle. 
Plus I'm retarded. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:35:34
Ok, maybe not McDonalds bucks. But lets say that you got 20% off for using McDonalds bucks and all you have to do was use this new exchange tech not yet invented to pay in said McDonalds bucks right at the check out. Wouldn't you? 
What happens if you are working for Dodge and their company currency is trading at 2:1 the USD and has a growth of 10% a year. Wouldn't you be getting paid in Dodge dollars, just like some people today are starting to get paid in BTC?

Nothing like waiting months or years for a return.. 
Dogecoin with save me!
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:33:59
Do they even have a phone number? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:25:58
It's totally rigged. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:02:40
It is a little crazy. I went from being a PVT in the Army to buying my fathers(who has cancer) house, opening a ROTH IRA, getting a ameritrade account and making 12,000 dollars in past 14 days. 
All thanks to Reddit because they were talking about the silkroad. Life is weird. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:37:36
That feel when you stayed up all night and dumped 10,000 USD into BTC at 600. The sheer terror of putting my money into BTC as it crashes. But then...it starts to rise and you sell at 780. 
To much pressure!!!!

Chase bank :P
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:50:02
Thank you for the quick reply. I really appreciate the help. I feel like I weathered a storm last night and come out with a nice payday. I'm in Bitcoin for the entire FY14. 
Here's to the moon!

You know the kid in the room with the big red button? Yeah..I just did it. 
I emailed them. Ill post what they say. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:55
I'm glad they helped you..
Sadly I bought 2.5 on Dec 07, 2013 and opened a ticket. I still haven't gotten them after being in contact with corgidad and he put it in an admin(Rees) inbox but nothing has happened. Now I've potentially lost 1500.00 dollars. Kinda of frustrating. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:27:48
I still have 10. I have a feeling they will be worthless. Fear and trust is a powerful thing in the market and the only ones with trust are the bitcoin jihadists.  Everyone is dumping now.

When is coinbase going public I want to buy a house....
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:32:50
Thank you for the advice. I actually bought a large amount when it was at 600. It was the best thing I could of done and I knew it was the right thing but when it started going into the 500s I was so nervous I didn't sleep. 
This is all so nerve racking but it shouldn't be. 
How do you calm your nerves when it's so volatile?

Buy xerox 
Profit?

j/k only then you can do is pray to the elder gods and wait a year or two.

What's the opposite for "Moon!'? 
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:38:59
Why would you invest money that you couldn't afford to have sit in BTC for "years"...
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:56:25
The 10 I still have I'm forgetting about for years. Just like I did with my original 400 :P  
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:52:51
BitCoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind—to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions.
He doesn't like this? I've never seen a bigger shill....
