Given a set profit though, and given the tax would be considered capital gains regardless, what difference does the methodology of how the profit is made come into play other than during an audit?

Thank's, I'll research it.

Done

That's not very nice.  Please consider the amount of energy used, future difficulty increases, and the amount of hardware required to process a minuscule amount of transactions per second.  Your grandma is mad at you for what you just said.

I agree SHA-256 can't, that's why it would need to be a different algorithm.  Can you give me a damn upvote so this get's more visibility?  Someone down voted this thread but it's fair.

You should change you vote dude.

Have you researched it at all?

If you are correct, perhaps the work could be balanced in a way so that it is both "wasteful" and "beneficial".  Maybe it could be balanced.  I bet there's a way.  Tons of computing power, tons, it could save lives.

It does, there are programs you can run on your PC to benefit Cancer and other illnesses.  They do protein folding simulations or something.

This is definitely true, I read it on the internet.

Try using the coinbase app on your phone instead of the website.  You may have better luck.

That's incredibly sad.

Wrong seed?

Ok, I thought it was going to be the 24th around 12pm.  That is early.  Maybe the article I read was in a far off timezone.

This is what MT Gox did to me before they collapsed.

I don't know, but I would guess that yes it will if it's profitable.  Everyone will do the same thing again.

That makes sense. They locked in their BTC Gold and are now buying back the cheap alts.  BTC will spike again once the new coin is available to sell I imagine.
