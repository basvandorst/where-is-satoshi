Bitcoin has way too many big holders to be stable, any of them can dump at a whim.

1 rich hacker then. :) BTC is mostly owned by a few dozen giants afterall.

lol wat
My CAD business account is 1.5% credit card and 24 cents for bank transfers, which means BTC costs more than debit.

Almost all mining is done by ASIC, and almost all ASIC miners are run by people rich enough to produce ASICs.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:51:48
Almost all is held by just a few people, and holding is creating the scarcity that props up the value.
Frankly I don't care about value, it's the horrible instability that prevents me from adopting it for real business.

What if I don't want one? :P

It's funny because it's true.
Although doge's problem is more autism than twats.

Money isn't as safe on a computer than in a vault, keep the BTC you don't want lost on a hard copy.

Bitcoin could be less volatile if it had a small number of it's few massive holders put in a ceiling and floor to lock the value to a range the market could then play in.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:45:52
You learned the hard way that with a crypto currency, for there to be winners there has to be losers, and there's more losers than winners.

The hammer is going to fall on TONS of people who think they can get around capital gains.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:02:37
Ceilings add a hell of a lot of mass to the market though.

Mine a coin early on and sell at the peak of the pump.
Hello DOGE autists, thanks for the 1 BTC.

Why would a consumer buy BTC to buy something with BTC when they could just... buy it?
I'm dealing with either very large bank deposits which cost $1 or very small transactions which cost 15 cents, Bitcoin is not cheaper for the consumer or me s it's pointless.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:10:52
VAT is stupid, capital gains makes sense.

Oh I don't know, for sending physical things?
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:49:28
Cryptsy had similar issues but fixed them... now they "loose" money more often instead of paying out more.

It's downfall is only coming when something superior comes along to supersede it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:43:42
3 causes: 
1. Transaction fees; Credit Card is 1.5% which means CC is cheaper than BTC for small transactions, BTC has priced itself out of micro-transactions which is a big market on the internet.
2. Trade hype roller coaster is finally ending.
3. Value up so volume down even though worth traded is similar.

Ya, most do that... except for when some don't. Every year there's a firesale, I wonder if it's just to attract attention.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:44:58
It's funny because it's more a case of 0 for all and most for 0.000001%, since wealth = mining power.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:38:57
Wow you don't even know what stock is do you.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:08:37
Bitcoin has it's own bank run, since soo much is owned by so few only a few big holders would have to sell to bomb the value. Since Bitcoin's only value comes from demand being greater than supply.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:52:49
I was not expecting this. What do I do now?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:40:17
It's a similar story with all coins... LTC is one of the best and still pretty bad.
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:17:23
I printed my wallet info onto some good ol archival grade paper... lol 1 BTC on paper.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:58:59
Bitcoin's fee is higher than my bank's(with some restrictions), and if I have a small minimum all transactions are free, also transfers are not instant, so bitcoin is much worse in that respect. BTC is much more convenient transferring random people money though.
I think transaction fee and transaction time are 2 weak points that may let something supersede BTC one day.

It's not doomed to fail... if whales put in a sell and buy wall.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:25:31
The fun thing is as mining gets harder, fewer people do it, and those with a shit-ton of computing power to waste can then fork the coin, again, and again, and again, and what about when mining is done?
Bitcoin will kill itself if it's not murdered.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:42:51
Any coin which is just a copy of an existing coin is just a money making scheme by the creators/insiders. DOGE and Quark have the worst wealth distribution of all coins because almost all are owned by just a few people. Bitcoin is pretty bad in this respect as well(lol keiser pumping while on coke) but percentage wise it's not as bad.
I welcome coins which are improvements though.

Well the company I'm with accepts 3 types of transaction: tiny(under $2 CC), medium(CC), and huge(cheques).
Bitcoin is pointless compared to our business paypal for tiny(under $2) because of the transaction fee, for large transactions we get paid via cheque which costs $1 to process, so bitcoin is cheaper, but the instability is a pain. Medium is where it could shine since that's where standard CC rates hurt.
Everyone says use bitpay because then you don't have to deal with the instability.... but why bother with USD-BTC-USD if you can just use USD or your local fiat straight up?
Normal people don't want to be bothered with such things.

Cryptsy is a great example of how capitalism's biggest flaw are stupid consumers.

Chinese gov barred bitcoin trading, expect global clampdown.
