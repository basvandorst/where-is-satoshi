I don't have 4k to spend

That's fair, like I said I'm still new to investing and even newer to the ideas of crypto currency.
I just hear about it alot and don't wanna be the guy kicking himself for not investing.

I'm planning to continuely invest
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:41:04
I'm pretty new to investing, I know you can't say for sure whether it'll go up or down, but Is it projected to continue rising? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:17:36
Well I'm definitely not regretting that much, I just don't know if I should continue to dump money in if people are expecting it to stagnate.
I know no one can accurately predict, I just was looking for insight from people who understand better than I.

For sure, I think I'll attempt to invest 25$ a week.
That way if it crashes I'm not shit out of luck and can afford to buy more for when it shoots up again.

Right now I'm investing about 300 a month through an app called acorns, was thinking of taking some and investing in bit coin.
How much a month do you think would be a good amount?
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:06:02
I'm honesty not sure, I'm very novice at investing and still learning.
I think it has potential to rise but was looking for expertise that was better than my own.
Currently I invest 300 a month of my 900 a month salary in a diverse set of stocks.
I'm thinking of taking some of that and investing in bit coin, but I'm unsure of how much is a good amount, I know it has raised tremendously in the last several years, but I don't know enough to say where it is going to stagnate soon.
That's why I'm here looking for advice.

Right now on Acorns I have it set on the moderately aggressive setting, for the last two months I've been setting the goal of 300 invested per month, I think from now on I may set 200 aside for Acorns and 100 aside for bit coin.
It's alot of money if I lose but honestly I'm at the age where I wanna take risks for my money and hopefully see large returns.
If I do 25 dollars a week it'll get equal on the volatility of it that way if I buy high and it crashes the next week I can invest 25 at the lower rank and recoup some money when it goes back up.

Yeah, I get all that. I think my best bet is investing 200 a month in acorns with what I consider more or more safe stocks and then 100 a month in bit.
I know it's not a crazy lot but I don't make a lot.
That way if it tanks I've still got 2/3rds working for me and not totally hosed.
In your opinion, do you think it will continue to rise semi steadily as it is now?
I know this is purely speculative and won't hold it against you if you're wrong, I'm just looking for input from people more experienced and better informed than I.
