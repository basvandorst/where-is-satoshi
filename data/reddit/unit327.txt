"If hackers stole my money from paypal the charges would just be reversed. Can bitcoin do that?"
"No, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which is actually a good thing for merchants, along with the lower fees..."
"But I'm not a merchant so why would I care about that?"
"Because in turn the merchants can offer lower prices due to these advantages."
"So I can buy stuff for cheaper using bitcoin than dollars?"
"Not really, at this point none of the merchants that accept it are really offering discounts for bitcoin..."
"So why should I use it?"
"Because supply is finite so the price will always go up. You should buy in now."
"That sounds like a pyramid scheme."
"No it's totally not!"
"Excuse me I have to.. go get a drink." 
"But your glass is nearly full?"
"Yeah I need to... um, go to the toilet. Seeya."

Of course this simply leads to another question, how did your friends pull this off? Did they just already have root access to the machine?

There is currently no method of providing anonymous low latency network connectivity without the ISP being able to detect it. They might not know *what* you are doing, but they know you are doing *something*. 
Certainly your suggestion of user-configurable ports wouldn't solve it.
Using a [tails]( livecd you can boot up, download electrum, put in the passphrase that is only stored in your head and you're set. Or just use the browser and log in to an online wallet. They'll possibly know you used tor for *something*, but they won't know that it was bitcoin related.

You can only say that now because hindsight has perfect certainty. And if you have perfect magical predictive powers, there's probably better investments than bitcoin (e.g. gambling).

Selling bitcoins randomly at a stall like this is going to be about as successful as selling high end liquid cooling PC gear at a bake sale. Anyone who knows about liquid cooling will get their gear elsewhere, and everyone else won't understand or want it.

I remember seeing some command line options for tor in bitcoind. Either that or just using an online wallet over tor browser bundle.

Yeah, but it just switches it from "no incentive to spend" to "no incentive to acquire in the first place". Either way you aren't spending bitcoins regularly.
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:31:56
I'd spend a lot more effort analyzing the "if bitcoins take off" part and a lot less on "how much they will be worth when they take off" part.
I have some bitcoins but little incentive to spend them if I believe the currency is going to do nothing but go up (due to the limited supply). If everyone hoards and doesn't spend, their usefulness due to their "frictionless" nature as you put it is nullified. For this reason they might not take off, indeed another cryptocurrency might take off instead.

They are one in the same. Tor does this to a degree, but any decent analysis will be able to distinguish tor traffic from normal SSL traffic.


Doing this for network traffic is too hard and may even be impossible.


Using the tails/electrum method I mentioned before, there is no trace left on the device after you turn it off.

This cost is significant and people don't get paid in bitcoins. If I spend $$$ on goods I get them cheaper than if I spend bitcoins.


Or you could have avoided the *marginal loss* bitcoin had in the interim. Your whole argument is predicated on a constantly increasing value of bitcoin, which is far from certain. Bitcoin is only a deflationary currency in the sense that supply is limited, but the other end of that equation, demand, is completely untethered and unpredicable in either the short or long term.

As a lefty I advocate for a higher taxation and a push further away from capitalism towards social democracy. I'm an environmentalist who thinks companies should be regulated and forced to pay for the damage they cause. I want to ban guns, I want to accept more refugees into my country, I'm a vegan and animal rights activist.
I'm a also a privacy advocate and a crypto-nerd, and I love the idea of a decentralised, low transaction fee system of exchanging wealth. I agree that this subreddit should be about bitcoin, not about political viewpoints, including my own.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:49:07
That's the old mantra chanted by every internet startup ever. "It's such a huge market, if we only get 2% we'll be rich!". You need to focus on why and how bitcoin is going to get that marketshare, not how big the market is.

I'd choose my words more carefully than that. If you're just talking about the protocol, then sure, but if you're talking about financial security, then that is far from certain. Bitcoin is only deflationary in that *supply* is limited. The other end of that equation, *demand* is completely untethered.

The average joe can't evade income tax in this way, because the average joe works for an employer who legally has to report his earnings. The larger the employer the greater the conspiracy has to be to cover it up, and the greater chance of one honest (or dishonest but disgruntled) employee blowing the whistle.
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:24:47
I see what you are getting at, if you collude with a corrupt employer, or are self employed, bitcoin makes it a bit more convenient to spend your illegally gained wealth. This makes the tax agencies have to work harder to bust you. To use cryptography parlance, they need to use side-channel attacks such as informants in the company or comparing the value of publicly purchased assets and expenses held in your name to your declared income.
That is a downside to bitcoin in my opinion, but it doesn't invalidate my stance as a supporter of bitcoin who is against libertarian principles. To be cliche, bitcoin can be used for good or evil, but I think the good outweighs the bad.

Currencies are useless as currencies if you can't spend em. Bitcoin's long term future is pegged to merchant and custotmer adoption. Human behavior is hard to predict.

Most people use that argument in relation to adoption, not as simplistically as you state it. I.e. why would I spend bitcoin rather than fiat, and if no one spends it, what does that mean for adoption?

@_date: 2013-11-18 00:25:12
That is true, but fiat doesn't have to struggle to get adoption; bitcoin does. In order to be useful as a currency, a "medium of exchange", the value has to settle down. Here's where the speculation starts, but at a guess, that won't happen while people are holding instead of spending, supply and demand being what it is. Of course with the value skyrocketing there's no incentive to spend it, which means merchants could accept it, but why bother when everyone is going to hold on  which means it's not useful as a currency and we're back where we started.
Basically if I am buying staplers online, and the merchant accepts bitcoin and fiat, what am I going to pay them with? I'll pay with fiat because bitcoin is skyrocketing and getting my hands on more bitcoin is difficult and costly. Conversely I get paid in fiat and the value is going down so I'll spend those. Now if merchants who accept bitcoin actually passed on the savings from the lower transaction fees and less chargeback fraud they have to face things might be different, but so far that doesn't seem to be happening.
I have no idea what this means for the long term value of bitcoin, but it does suggest that we can never switch from fiat to bitcoin because merchants will never adopt it en mass.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:07:15
You're talking about a possible future where bitcoin has taken over as the de facto currency. In that case, when you need to buy staplers, you would buy them in bitcoin.
I'm talking about buying staplers *right now* and why you'd be crazy to buy them with bitcoin. I'm talking about how the transition to bitcoin might work, because without those intermediate steps your bitcoin utopian future will never come about.

Why not?


This sounds a bit like all the protections built into consumer devices (xbox, ps, tivo, cabletv boxes) to stop people putting their own firmwares on. None of them have ever been successful, and the incentive here is a lot bigger than getting free games/tv channels. How does visa etc get around this problem? My guess is that part of their defense is reversible transactions, which you can't rely on.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:13:47
Do you think that if your wages got paid in btc, you wouldn't have to pay tax? Under the law your employer would still have to withhold tax and report your earnings. Sure you could conspire an "under the table" agreement, but that can already be done in any number of other ways (i.e. with cash).
In my view, the promise of bitcoin isn't that it takes power away from government, it's that it takes it away from the financial middle men.

First up, make sure you get a clean install and change any and all passwords to all of your accounts (e.g. online banking).
Can you please post some more info, I'm very interested top learn what possibly compromised your arch linux install. Can you answer the following questions?
1. What is your best guess for how they got in?
2. That 50 character password you mentioned, was that for the passphrase on the wallet itself?
3. Did you use that same password for anything else?
4. How do you remember your passwords? Do you use a password manager? If so do you share that password database on other machines?
5. Is remote ssh access to that machine enabled? Does /var/log/auth.log show anything suspicious?
6. Have you opened any email attachments or downloaded any files lately which strike you as odd in hindsight?
7. What kind of encryption are you using on that thumbdrive that you mentioned?
8. Is there anything you can think of which would have led to you being specifically targeted?

Disc encryption (of any kind) only protects you from people physically stealing your box and attempting to pull data off of it. Once you boot up and enter the passphrase to decrypt stuff, it's the same as if it's not encrypted at all. FDE, truecrypt, luks or whatever wont help you if the pc gets a keylogger or other malware on it.
