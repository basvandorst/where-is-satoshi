I'll be riding from Milan to Berlin in about 3 weeks, through west Austria, so it might be possible! Where abouts are you based my friend?

Are transaction fees currently to high to be used in the developing world? Is the minimum transaction value not requiring a fee 0.01BTC? i.e. about $5? 
Is there a calculator to work out the smallest transaction fee thats currently required? (or how long you will have to wait for block inclusion?) Based on statistics of what miners are accepting and the transaction priority/days destroyed?

Its not simply proof of passport, but proof of passport with zero knowledge confirmation. You can prove that the node has a valid passport, without knowing any details of that passport.

Perhaps there should be a ideological patch; The bigger p2pool the less variance. The faster p2pool grows, the less variance big pools will exposed to by switching, miners in p2p pool will be exposed to low variance for a shorter time integral. To speed the up the switching time, miners could coordinate to switch on a specific date-time, i.e. patch day. There could be a site where pools can sign, to post their intent to switch on patch day.

This is the real cloud. Dropbox is more like a blimp or drone.

My thoughts exactly, PR gold. Thanks RNLI, hope my 10mBTC are useful for you.
I can feel a wave of adoption building!

We've never had something that's infintely divisible like bitcoin. I've had people struggle to understand the difference between money printing and dividing into smaller chunks, in order to expand the economy.

A bit is a unit of information that has already been taken. Stop trying to make things 'easier' through dumbass notation.

"What we need to do is shift people out of the model where they are coming into an office everyday... [Doing automatable work] and the only reason they have those jobs is that banks don't interact with programs, only people."
Wow!
