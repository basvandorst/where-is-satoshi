Don't forget you can deduct any bitcoin related losses ,as long as you keep good records .
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:56:12
If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim on line 13 of Form 1040 to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000, ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 16 of the Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF). If your net capital loss is more than this limit, you can carry the loss forward to later years. You may use the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet found in Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, or in the Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), to figure the amount you can carry forward.

Many people dumping because they don't think or don't want the coin price too rise.
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:38:01
Just look for  Bitcoin Accepted Here 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:01:57
The huge increase in the mining network/difficulty has prevented a major price decline!
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:11:00
It's good to know that China is irrelevent,unlike a year ago!
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:05:21
It caused the stock price to jump today.
@_date: 2014-11-01 13:41:45
On the supply/ mining side you have to many large farms dumping coins with low buy/demand.The price will not rise under current conditions.
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:59:15
I like it,but when will it go live?
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:56:13
Nothing to see here
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:40:26

Why would any rational human give up bitcoins and lose them on miners?
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:50:02
Washington is anti america,everything that is passed proves this.Stop voting for the incumbents and always vote for a new person with no regard of party!This is why Bitcoin will grow because Washington causes the Growth and Washington will never change!

Insurance is not new and it also applies to Bitcoin:
There appear to be four possible Property coverage grants for stolen Bitcoins – as “money”, “electronic data”, “digital assets” or “valuable papers and records”. These definitions comes from wording in a Fidelity (Crime) policy, Property policy, and Network Security (Cyber) policy. Each policy could potentially respond to a loss of Bitcoins.
