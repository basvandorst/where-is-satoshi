Doubt this is legit: middleschooler, throwaway, paper wallets, intentional grammatical errors. If you know how bitcoin works in middle school, you should be able to English properly. 
My friends kid barely found out about bitcoin through a billboard, he's 12. This kids parents work as a designer and a developer. He has an item in the steam workshop for tf2 and he learned to code for minecraft/plugins.  I consider him to be the most technologically gifted kid in my circle of friends and he barely found out about bitcoin through a billboard...
This leads me to believe OP is a troll or a 12 year old degenerate gambler.

The house always wins. He sounds like a typical degen and casinos love degenerate gamblers. As long as they are bankrolled, the house will always get their money back.

This A - name record vs alias (cname/www). A name must go to an IP whilst c-name can go to a host. Usually people have domain.com redirects to  Don't worry, if someone gained access to mtgox's dns control panel, they would do more than just change 1 record and lose half of the potential victims.
