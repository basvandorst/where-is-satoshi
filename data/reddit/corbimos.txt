Listen to this podcast
After that, go to Andreas' youtube cahnnel and lose yourself for a few days. He is the most influential educator in bitcoin/crypto, and an all around good guy. I always recommend his lectures when getting my friends and family into crypto.

I like how they show the [bitcoin chart at 1 week] ( since it was down. But [facebook's chart]( was year to date...
Also wtf did that guy say??


"I don't care what happens to bitcoin. It is not an investable item for me because I can't transfer money without being allied in some ways with drug traffickers or whatever it is, and it's not regulated"
Why would he be allied with drug dealers? The US Government has literally dealt drugs to it's citizens for whatever reason, and drugs are sold with USD everyday. Why do people keep saying dumb shit like this?

On block 500439 the TX fees surpassed the block reward by about 1 btc.
Yes, fees were very high at that time, but it still shines a light on what is to be expected in the future. 
If demand is increasing and people learn how to use tx fees more efficiently (i.e. sending low tx fees and expecting to stay in mempool for days/weeks) we can expect to see consistent, full blocks with enough TX fees to keep mining profitable. 
The difficulty adjustment does help keep an equilibrium when miners turn off.

On the flip side, you can write off losses.

If you trade a $2000 car for a $6000 car, that is still a "zero sum" trade cause you still have a car, but that car is worth more than what you paid originally. That is still a gain. I don't like the IRS, but i see that point.

Talk about austrian economics. Just do a summary of the Bitcoin standard. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 15:07:23
You have to agree you won't use it for drugs and what not. Having to agree is not the best but it's understandable to protect the creators.

Round I'd are the mixing rounds. They make the coins more fungible each cycle. Coordinator fees go to the creators I think.

I believe you! I wish more people would spread awareness instead of holding it all. Great job!

Who was the lucky winner!?
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:33:04
How will you chose the winner through the reddit comments? Just be transparent about that and no one can whine. Thanks for doing this!

This post hurts my feels. Sorry about your coins. RIP. But hey, look at it as giving back to the other hodlers!

I believe you need to set it up somehow. Im sure it'll be a fuction within the core full node or somthing like that.

You can increase the amount without seeing the private key. Once you spend it, it is no longer usable. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:11:52
You need a node monitoring the specified channel. It can be outsourced with the same level of security to a 3rd party. This party could be a company for a fee, your uncle for free, or the city as part of your taxes. Or you could just run full node at home.

It wasnt even a proposal in the first place. It was an agreement.

Please update what you find out. I am very interested as well.

Only sue if they switch out your coins for 2x. That is fraud, and an offense i'd sue over. Its not just a disagreement.

Don't use Conbase. Use Cash app. I have BoA and they don't know I buy btc.

But in the end, its a fork. They should give you both tokens and let you decide.

Look up how open source software works. 
Nothing that is closed source can take over Bitcoin. If it really has provable new tech. Bitcoin will absorb it.

Who paid for the Bitcoin logo?
Edit: Found an answer, 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:15:45
Good info!
What are some suggestions to alleviate this issue?
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:42:45
it completely busts your privacy.
If you are viewing that info on a 3rd party blockchain explorer, or anything that is not from your own full node. Those servers could keep track of all of your funds and add you to Chain Analysis.
They would have your IP and most likely name from that unless you use tor or a VPN. 
Look at BTCpay server, you can setup your wallet/import public key and track it there. it will all come from your own node.
