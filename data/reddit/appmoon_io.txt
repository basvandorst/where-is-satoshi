Firezoo have uploaded a new Android app that accepts bitcoin to appmoon.
Purchases are cheap, each is just $0.01.  So it's a cool way to try out the lightning network. You can buy new levels and aircraft. There are no ads in the game.

We plan to write something to help.  We also have a SDK which will be made public on GitHub. It only took an hour to add the checkout code to the game in the original post.

It's not sped up, but we are so used to the checkout we did tap through a bit quick.   Check out this birds eye view video it shows what's going on in real time

Yes! We are working on something along these lines ;)

appmoon is website/app store for android apps that accept bitcoin payments via the lightning network.  We have started with few games to try for free on our beta website - [
All  apps are using BTCPayServer and LND to process their payments. But it's up to the developer to decide what services they want to use.
Some features for users are:
* No Ad Networks Allowed
* No Account required
* However, accounts let you backup/restore purchases
If you haven't tried the Lightning Network yet, this is an easy way to test it out (Android only).
1. Download a mobile wallet, such as Blue Wallet
2. Send a small amount of btc to it.
3. Download a game on [
4. Find something you like in the app make a purchase
The developer gets 100% of the sale.
EDIT: Here is a birds eye view, showing finger tapping etc:

You confirm the purchase in your wallet; sorry the video is a bit fast.  Here's a birds eye view

Just bitcoin via Lightning Network.

If the developer of the game received btc from a user via lightning network, the developer can spend that money within the lightning network immediately.

iOS doesn't let users download apps outside their App Store.  They also do not allow Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.  So unless Apple go all in on Bitcoin, the best guess is never for iOS.

The game items are slightly cheaper than they cost when compared to the Google Play store version.  Also the app moon versions have no adverts.
Definately possible to create 1 sat purchases though.  Such as extra lives etc. :D

Connect the Dots, just added to [appmoon.io](
All in app purchases are payable in bitcoin via the Lightning Network.
The purpose of the game is to complete the puzzles by connecting the dots with one line and not going over the same game twice.  It can get tricky in the harder levels.
First 50 levels are free.  You can buy 250 more with a small lightning payment. The payment example in the video is using Bluewallet to pay, and BTCPayServer for the developer to receive.
It's available on Android: [appmoon.io/connectthedots](
No Ads!

We managed to get some nodes open some liquidity to us.  We also sent liquidity from our node to some custodial wallets and sites.  The liquidity battle will be on going though

Good point.  Added a link to the original post to a youtube video which shows a birds eye view.  [
