Not so sure anymore after reading this little part.
The last sentence is plain false, the past had way more wars.
The previous claim (fiat/printing money enables bigger war chest on cost of the population) is reasonable. But making stuff up, just because it would fit your argument nicely really grind my gears.
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:48:31
Using excess energy is fine, but let's not kid ourselves, it won't be just that. And increasing the cost of energy isn't a good thing.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:59:53
I know that Bitcoin has important use cases (and I do own BTC) and I do think that having a use for otherwise waste energy is great.
But if cost of energy goes up, cost of living goes up. 
Also there is a issue with the variable output, you won't use the miners to their full capacity. Buying expensive mining equipment to just run it 20% of the time, isn't that great - even if the energy would be wasted otherwise.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:06:41
Ressource consumption is an important criteria and one that Bitcoin still needs improvement on. It's less of a problem if it runs on clean energy, but it's still a problem.

This question is very flawed: "How much publicity of a given post does there need to be to move your position?"

To be fair, if the formula would include enough reasonable data you might get better odds and it could be considered as investing. But like your roulette example, most players don't have enough good data and it ends up being a guess anyway.

There are way too many unknown factors to interpret the data correctly. E.g. an upward movement could be due to the opening of a new exchange, a well known movie star tweeting, a tax legslation change somewhere or a bored millionare.

From my experience it does work and give about 4-8% per year. But in my opinion it's not worth the additional risk of the exchange being hacked, unless you plan to hold the coins there for a while anyway.
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:31:13
Yes, I've taken that into account. The given rate can change drastically as it's determined by supply&amp;demand though. 4-8% a year was just what I got when I've tried it for about 3 months (I've calculated how much it would make me in a year with compound interest).

I agree with both of you, the power consumption of Proof of work isn't good, but it's currently the most secure way. Currently changing the system wouldn't be a good idea. I would just like it to be acknowledged as a flaw that should be fixed in the future instead of trying to spin it's power consumption is actually great for the world. The power consumption is not good for the users either (they have to pay for it in fees), so it should be in all our best interest to keep it low.

No, it's a common misconcecption that if it's green energy wasting it is no problem at all, because it's free. It's less bad than wasting coal energy for sure, but it's still not good.

You could also write down the mining process, it's just a tiny bit slower:
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:48:56
Incorrect, a ponzi scheme requires new money at an exponentially increasing rate to not collapse. Bitcoin only requires a linear amount (one equal to new coins - lost coins) to be stable. Actually that amount is going down due to the halving events.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:49:00
Yeah that's a good point. I just don't like it when it's treated as a total non-issue (which happens quite frequently in this sub).

The current use of electricity isn't worrysome, the potential future use however is. I am still hopeful that a solution to make this process more efficient will be found though. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:00:19
No, if Bitcoin would be the global goto currency the use of energy would a problem as well, even if it's all renewable (current renewable energy sources have some environmental costs too btw). Sources like coal just make it way worse.
Bitcoin energy consumption via POW is bound to the price, not to the amount of transactions. It does provide a lot of security, but at some point it becomes unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:59:40
how to whataboutism
(If you want to refute a statement don't do it by pointing to another thing saying "but they do it, too/even worse"; Bitcoin existing doesn't stop gold mines and gold mines polluting something doesn't tell anything about how good or bad Bitcoin is for the environment.)
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:38:40
Neither Bitcoin nor Fiat is a Ponzi scheme.
Ponzi, snowball and pyramid schemes crash and burn once the amount of demand doesn't grow fast enough at an increasingly faster rate. 
Investments crash (and maybe burn) when the demand (in relation to supply) decreases, but stagnation is fine.

@_date: 2018-11-09 09:25:27
It doesn't refute the argument at all.
Even if current Bitcoin was to replace gold 1:1, it doesn't go
Gold -&gt; bad pollution, therefore Bitcoin no bad pollution
You still need to refute it with the actual pollution numbers scaled up to the level of gold production. 
Also you need to include differences: e.g. the mined gold will stay useful without further mining, but Bitcoin needs it to exist. On the other hand gold is expensive to transport. It's quite tough to make a useful comparison.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:42:02
It doesn't need a leader to have a purpose (one that most people see in it). Do your parents pay your electric bills or how do you arrive at the conclusion that use of electricity is a non-issue? (Sorry, that was a bit mean, but really how do you come to that conclusion? The current use might be not that much, but the potential use if Bitcoin capture a big part of the economy isn't.)
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:50:27
Btw I don't push against the opinion that energy is a non-issue, because I want to hate on Bitcoin. Quite the opposite, I am invested in it and want that potential problems to be solved. But if people don't want to look at it, it will take longer.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:13:28
Once I know I want a certain investment, I try to avoid trying to time the one best time using the following idea:
Plan a minimum and maximal potential investment, where the minimum is an amount you wouldn't be too salty if you didn't invest more. 
Buy instantly with the minimum amount.
Divide the rest into several amounts that you use to buy if the price drops e.g. 10%/25%/50%.
That way you relieve the feeling of missing out and the panic of a pricedrop at least somewhat.

Bitcoin isn't bad, it's a first step to a trading system ruled by mathematics instead of politicians or private companies, which is great for the most part. Also it does matter how energy is produced (where did I say it doesn't matter?), it's just that renewable isn't completely free either.
Current Bitcoin cannot handle the whole monetary system, and the energy it would consume if it had the corresponding price point would be ridiculously huge. It will need to change in some ways.

Take a look at the imported (Bitcoin) adresses (Settings-&gt;Adresses). You can use  to check if there is anything on there. If there is, you can look up the private key in blockchain.info (select "More Options" right to the imported adresses to see it) to access those funds and send them to an exchange (e.g. with Coinomi app)
Move the expensive ones (BCH, BTG) first and take care to never use the address again after claiming all the other stuff!

Those factors are correct, second layer solutions could potentially alleviate the problem a lot.
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:12:39
Actually the confirmation of transactions would be slower until the next difficulty adjustment.
If you lose 10% of mining power, there will be 10% less blocks in I think it was about 2 weeks+10% then. As the adjustment is done per x blocks, an extremely sharp drop could be an issue, but is unlikely to happen for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:21:53

More energy only equals more wealth if it isn't all sucked up by inefficiencies ;P
if you press 9x9 on a calculator you achieve the same thing as when you press 9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9, but the second option requires way more work for you.
And the production needs to come from somewhere, as long as we need to screw up our planet to gain more, a higher incentive to produce more is not a good thing. It will come with drawbacks.

Personal enjoyment of the milkshake is an improvent in quality of your life, isn't it? This is way more subjective to judge as inefficient while the example with the 2 light bulbs is not.
Utilitariasm isn't necessary for this, you can be totally egoistical and still profit from making your tools efficient.
Your description of the market sounds like determinism, which I don't fully subscribe to (but that is full philisophical discussion in itself). We are part of that process, so we are able to stir it, even if it's just a little bit.
Since you are tired of discussing, I won't comment any further.

@_date: 2018-07-18 15:00:37
Yes, it would still be wasteful, if it consumes tons of energy and doesn't secure many transactions. You still need some work, materials and place for solar panels. Solar isn't completely free.
Coal plants make the problem way worse though.
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:03:38
More energy only equals more wealth if it's used correctly. If you use two lamps with 15W you can light 2 rooms, if you use one less effective one with 30W you can only light one (and heat it more).
Energy from nuclear plants isn't problemfree, especially the mining for it does hit nature. And the toxic waste is an unsolved problem for later generations, while it's costing a lot to store. Not sure how you don't know that.
I didn't ignore the reward decay, I actually even mentioned it as an effect that helps a bit in the first post. Also we ARE the market and if we don't stir it in the right direction the market is a cold and cruel thing.
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:37:22
It's certainly an approach that could lead to a solution or at least helps decreasing the problem.
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:18:24
I'm a bit worried because we are probably dealing with further exponential ressource consumption. I do think solutions will be found for this. The mining reward drop and scaling solutions like lightning will already help somewhat. But it's better to be aware of such problems. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:22:36

Let's imagine Bitcoin moons like 100x next year, then ressource consumption (hardware+energy) would probably rise about the same* , because mining is essentially an alternate option to buy. I'm not sure, if that would be still sane.
*or make it really expensive, supply/demand yaddayadda, would still suck.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:58:49
To make a fair comparison: The instant bank transaction doesn't equal the 10 minutes Bitcoin confirmation. The confirmation is more like the settlement, which is faster with Bitcoin. And at a lot of banks (at least in my country) you do have to pay for your account, unless you receive a certain amount of money monthly.
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:34:10
Mining is like a slower way to buy Bitcoin, it would catch up with the price. Energy certainly can be wasted, please stop spouting such nonsense. E.g. If that TV runs without anyone watching the energy is wasted.
If Bitcoin is wasteful depends on how many transactions it manages to secure by that time. So go go Lightning, I guess.

@_date: 2018-07-10 16:07:07
Yeah, we need to strive to achieve as much as possible with as little ressources as possible.
I don't know the solution to the problem (/the shovel) yet, maybe good secondary networks (e.g. lightning) will be enough, maybe a different Proof of... is needed. I'm just quit sure that this problem will exist when Bitcoins moons (as in 100x/1000x).
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:50:32

But denying the inefficiency might lead to Bitcoins downfall. 
I'm not advocating for any current altcoin/fiat/gold or whatever, if that's what you think. I actually have a stake in Bitcoin.

Litecoin isn't an improvement, just as you say it would experience the same increase in hashrate and energy consumption. I don't consider any of the current altcoins an contender yet, there are some interesting trys, but they are too buggy or unsecure.
How does it f*ck up the market? Easy by making electricity extraordinary expensive. While there is some smoothing of the curve - which isn't bad - most miners would wan't to turn off their exepnsive hardware off during the day and miss the "easier time" before the next difficulty jump.
If you want a small scale effect that's already happening:
Altcoinmining makes some PC components like graphic cards more expensive than they would be without it. (1st world problem, I know). The energy market is huge, but if Bitcoin goes x100 or x1000 again we will see effects.
