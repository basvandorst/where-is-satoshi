Are you trying to get the Feds to contact you? Because now they can use what you wrote against Blake.
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:07:30


you answered your own question
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:52:44


Why is that justice served? If someone threatens you with the capital punishment or 1 month in prison if you take the plea, how is that anything but admission *under duress* / forceful extraction of confession? Who in their right mind would take that gamble?
 I don't know what Charlie did or not. Plea deals just mean people don't get a fair trial where all the evidence can be seen. Given 98% of all convictions are obtained via plea deals, the whole justice system is a complete travesty.
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:38:38
Maybe. I just don't see how offering up your somewhat private insights with him do him any service.

Smells like BS.

Or he has to appear to do so for fear that the forearm of the law will double fist him further.
@_date: 2014-12-20 19:44:01
If he is guilty, then they should give him his day in court. It should be straightforward for them. I don't get why you should risk life in prison to get a fair trial.
They're either bribing him with less time (so they get less work) or they are putting him under duress. Neither of which you would want in a *justice* system.

That's not how it works.
If people don't want to invest in the economy and prefer storing their funds in cash, then they'll just find another safe haven for it. Or move it abroad.

What is sensible is for people to do what they wish with their money. Forcing them into buying other assets is immoral. That is all.

@_date: 2014-12-19 14:52:04
I meant to say that you are probably one of these average customers, not one of the rich ones who will be affected by the rates.

You forget the added risk and reduced liquidity. You are not sensible it seems.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:45:39
I don't have the choice of not using fiat unfortunately. Therefore, the government regulated interest rates are not something I can ignore as it affects all businesses as well as private individuals. I am forced into using a bank, as most transactions over a certain amount cannot even be done legally with cash.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:45:20

You probably shouldn't

He does has a really shit-level French education if you look up his profile up.
It is consistent with the Gox fuckup, but not so much with the DPR SR mastermind. But who knows. If it could lead to Karpeles' arrest, that would be a good thing.
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:43:13


Government regulation is directly opposed to innovation and freedom. They'll be pushing more Bitlicense-type nonsense.
Jeff Garzik, a rabid statist, is on the board and he is quoted with saying: *[We are working with the government to make sure indeed the long arm of the government can reach Bitcoin](
They have a team of 6+ people so they must be burning through a lot of cash. Who funds them and why? Looks like VC and Bitcoin ventures looking to cozy up to the government to maximize their investments. Good for them, but not for Bitcoin which was built to be outside of  government control.
I'm pretty certain nothing good can come from this thinktank. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:47:04
well at least we have established you have no counter-arguments. So like a good retard, you resort to insults. Gotcha.

I doubt it though. Seems like Karpeles had been clowning around for a long time. Roger is essentially a bad judge of character as well as unable accurately to evaluate a business - or worse: he's implicated.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:25:31
strange to think he had time to do this sort of thing while running Gox. Now it makes sense: he wasn't running anything - just stealing.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:03:43
"actual reality" is not an argument. You have no leg to stand on. That's the actual reality.
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:43:54


Not maybe. For sure.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:40:16


I don't think you do actually.


Agreed and this is fundamental.


How can people give other people the authority to run something they do not themselves own? Can your neighbors elect themselves to run your house?
People do not have the right to initiate force onto others, impose their preferences onto others by force, tax people etc. Therefore because government derives its power from these same people it cannot have these abilities either. I cannot give you a right I don't have.


Running a country first requires a monopoly on force. The rest is just for decoration.


You mean like the Jim Crow laws. I think you're confused if you think morality and law are the same thing.


You can have rules or rulers, but not both.
If you want rules but not rulers, then I recommend looking into poly-centric legal systems.
If you want rulers but not rules, then that is what we have in government.


Except the government is not your mom and dad as much as you'd like it to be. You nor I agreed to have government in charge of us. You know that because they must use force in everything they do. You know government is doing exactly what people don't want because they have to use force. It's the exact opposite of voluntary.
Government is more akin to a bully or a slave owner. If the victim/slave doesn't obey his rules or pay his dues, he get caged or killed.

@_date: 2015-01-07 21:08:30


Glad you enjoyed it. I recommend these videos for further investigation 


If you redefine the word "own" to mean something else, then you are correct. That's why starting from clear first principles and definitions is the best way to go - something a statist abhors since it shows the self-contradictory nature of the state.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:05:51
Can I run your business, house, computer or car? Of course not. I would need to own them to do so.
You still haven't answered my question.

If you are regulatedbyMath then you would be regulatedbylogic too. Logic leads to ancap, which you are not. Thus you are not regulatedbyMath.

Why even bother highlighting something yet not presenting an argument? It just makes you look foolish once again. I'm happy to hear your argument if you have one.

Thanks for your support. We all make mistakes. I can try to blame you but ultimately it was my decision.

Equality? What do you mean by that?
There is little freedom in democratic states. It's the majority lording over the minority. A horrible system. Something you would abhor to apply in your own life.
There is no rule of law: 
and not everybody is subject to the rule of law: see cops, politicians, government agents etc.  Can you arrest or tax others? If not, you are not under the same rules.

It is important. It should be a stigma that person bears with them for the rest of their lives. Working against your fellow man is not something that should be taken lightly nor forgotten. 


That would be great.
