Yes, and if you symlink an encrypted .dmg, don't forget to unmount the image after you have closed the client.  Keep a backup of it on a USB drive and/or offsite on iDisk or Dropbox.

Wow, I step away from reddit for 2 hours...damn it.

The only people on r/bitcoin are the technologically-inclined who will be responsible for building the infrastructure around the currency.  We're very early adopters at this point, and to suggest buying something using a currency whose value can fluctuate by &gt;1000% in a week isn't the best advice.  It's a much smarter for OP to make those coins work for him, by trading them on the exchange, holding onto them in anticipation or growth, or use them to invest in mining.  The agoristic market of bitcoins will come in time.

There weren't any specific attacks on Gmail that I know of.  I read on the [forums]( that an enterprising Google employee scoured the list for gmail addresses and forced them all through the password reset.  This was a good thing.

Ok actually I've been trying to symlink just the wallet.dat file and am not having much luck.  The client keeps overwriting it with a fresh wallet file.  Any ideas with symlinking?
Edit: Nevermind I got it working after unmounting the image and remounting it.  Must not have worked because it was mounted as it was created.

I'd like to see other exchanges like Tradehill supported as well.  Their full trading API should be ready in a few days.

I do not.

How does one measure those temps?  And what's a safe/dangerous range?
@_date: 2011-06-17 00:29:10
That would indeed explain my problem.

If this guy is for real, then I agree with his conclusions.  His argument basically boils down to, should a bank shut down all transactions because a person lost their ATM card?  
I see two possible ways that this played out, since we don't know everything:
1) MtGox's security was compromised and it is their poor security that allowed this account to be hacked and liquidated.  If this is the case, then they should be held liable for the damages to that single account holder - but only if they actually are liable based on whatever user agreements they had in place when people created accounts.  A private arbitrator could decide this.  
2) An individual's account was compromised separately from the MtGox security issues of the last week.  If this is the case, then too bad for that person, but this is where personal responsibility takes over.  It's up to each and every one of us to protect our investments in the best way we see fit, and accept the consequences of playing this game.
I happen to like his Option 3, and I definitely do not think rolling back the trades is fair or legitimate for anyone involved, with the possible exception of the compromised account holder.

Yes, I was wishing I had exactly this just the other day.

I'm not sure if it's Dwolla or the bank you use, but I had this exact same thing happen to me.  Wanted to buy on MTGox when it was around 5.50, and couldn't really buy until yesterday.  It's a pain.  Wish I had done this in March when I first started thinking about it and the price was 1.20.

I believe that if the bank vault (Mt.Gox's BTC account) were stolen from, and the bank (Mt.Gox) did not previously have any sort of insurance or an agreement with its clients that they would back their losses, and the contents of the vault were sold in an entirely legitimate manner, then no, the bank does not have the right to coercively take back the money from the people who bought it on the market.  Vis a vis, all those who purchased coins with bid orders should rightfully be allowed to keep their purchases.
That is not to say that Mt.Gox should not be held liable.  I left that up in the air, and I believe a private arbitrator would be best to decide that outcome.  But if it means Mt.Gox would have to reimburse those who unfairly lost money, then that is merely the penalty for failing to secure and defend their website.
I base all my conclusions on the notion of private property, and responsibility of defending that property resting *solely* with the owner of said property.  I could also argue that those who deposited money into Mt.Gox accepted the risk of losing everything when they did so.  This is why I think this is best left to an arbitrator to decide.
**tl;dr No rollback.  Let an arbitrator mutually agreed on by Mt.Gox and Kevin/people who bought coins during the selloff decide the outcome.**
