Our quarterly China FUD
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:22:26
I’ve sent four transactions over the last week. Each time I set a fee that Electrum dictated would go through “within 25 blocks.” Every transaction, I kept the Blockchair page open and watched its priority status fluctuate in the mempool. 
Every time I would check the mempool over the past week, it was getting spammed to ~150,000 transactions. Most of it, from what I saw, was identical transactions for 50 cents worth of bitcoin
It’s clear to me bitcoin is still being actively spammed. What I want to know is what’s being done to prevent this. Obviously it’s expensive to spam the mempool, but slightly less so if you’re a miner.

You can have it! I've been trying to trade mine in for some newer, more valuable bitcoins for ages.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:25:39
lol no. This is just glorified sibling infighting. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:15:50
Not to mention being able to set buy/sell orders in a variety of ways. Coinbase is consumer-grade trash

I'd take a nice brief drop to re-up tbh

Ah the ol' reddit nazi-roo

Miners are too busy gaming the shit out of BCH
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:22:27
Except the engine requires it? Do you know anything about cars or just spouting rhetoric?
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:09:28
It sucks and it holds crypto back a bit IMO, but it's up to you to make sure your portfolio is sound. If you're worried, then maybe you should buy BCH. If you hold equal amounts of both, you won't lose. "Don't put your eggs in one basket"
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:43:04
You don't know what you're talking about. You're spouting rhetoric about the amount of detergent that's in gasolines (regular being enough for all cars). This has nothing to do with the octane rating of fuels. Engines with a high compression ratio require higher octane since octane inhibits combustion, which causes fuel to burn in a more controlled manner. Higher octane fuels are less efficient but safer for high performance engines.
The last thing you want with an engine with a high compression ratio (say, &gt;10:1) is a higher likelihood of unwanted ignitions. In my case, my car's engine has a compression ratio of 12.5:1.

Yup but the whales and mass hodling keep the scarcity and price very high. But we may have to see more evenly-distributed wealth before we think about a $1m BTC
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:53:51
Did you even try to make a decent caption
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:08:09
It seems like any remotely successful crypto gets pump and dumped at least a few times in its early stages. BTC has definitely had its fair share of pump and dump over the years. 
As the wealth gets distributed, it will become less volatile. Only time will tell what happens to BCH. Anyone claiming to know one way or another is just pushing a personal agenda. Crypto is way too young to even have steady patterns. We could be using Dogecoin in 10 years for all we know. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:57:47
This. No reason to have both. You can use either of them for the same codes. Some sites just need to be manually configured on the apps.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:04:13
So they're all in on BCH too?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:24:07
Damn bro what do you drive

I'm all in on this meme
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:35:38
Ah that sucks. It takes a minimum of 0.02 BTC to validate. Wish I could help you
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:35:27
I don't see Bitcoin as a day-to-day currency anymore. In the future we'll still be using something issued by governments regardless. Whether they issue their own digital currency or not, who knows. I just don't see countries like the US just relinquishing their control of the national currency all willy-nilly
That being said, I think Bitcoin's future is a replacement for gold. I feel like with Blockstream/Core's focus on security, Bitcoin could retain value if it proves to be the safest crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:47:36
This is fucking cool. Can't wait to get this up and running

Wow, the video even explicitly mentions financial and currency exchange companies using these services.

It costs me ~$25 USD for 10 gallons of premium fuel (≥93 octane). About $2.50 a gallon. But this is in a state that has multiple large oil refineries.

These threads are so dumb. If you sold at $x, you would have also sold at $y a week later. All you can do is learn from your misfortune.

Steep learning curve associated with the tech and the fact that it's completely backwards from the current socioeconomic structure. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:22:35
The 950 BTC is probably from when it was worth less than $0.01, so not really all that valuable
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:01:48
Not worth it unless you have less than 200k BTC
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:21:33
True, but a lot of active holders dumped their BCH as fast as they could. It's possible a lot of that got bought by just one or two people which would make BCH less evenly-distributed than BTC. That makes BCH more susceptible to pump and dumps.
In the same vain, people insta-dumping their BCH is what could have kept the price down for as long as it was, and now it's finally approaching its "true" market value.

@_date: 2017-08-17 14:26:25
You can use smaller denominations like mBTC, Bits/uBTC, and Satoshi. I feel like if Bitcoin were to see mass adoption, things would eventually be priced in Satoshi but renamed to something else. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:53:08
I fail to see how Coinbase could be legitimately adding 100k unique users day after day. This headline pops up seemingly every day.
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:13:17
lol that profile picture is amazing all around
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:48:51
The powerful processors make it possible to take really good photos with your phone. It essentially compensates for the relatively inferior lenses (compared to DSLRs and such). 
I also think it will allow Apple to eventually open up their OS. We may see iOS approach macOS functionality if so many generations of iPhone have very capable processors

BTC about to skyrocket
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:57:59
Fuck Coinbase. They could learn a thing or two from the good people of GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:49:43
The VISA comparison is so annoying because they don't actually process transactions on the spot. Credit/debit card transactions take days to process. 
Not to mention BTC can never replace credit cards. The only thing that might change is people pay off their balances with BTC instead of fiat. I don't think people who keep wishing for VISA-level tx/sec understand that most of that is just credit being traded around, not actual money. BTC doesn't need to reach that kind of volume because not even fiat is being exchanged like that.
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:01:36
I'd be very very surprised. I just don't see the point of Bcash other than people creating millions out of thin air. If you want cheap microtransactions, use Dogecoin. 
But if it retained the Bitcoin name and caused an extreme shift in value, then yes, most likely.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:22:21
Yeah this was a weird revelation. I had ~$7 worth of BTC sitting in my Coinbase wallet and was trying to figure out how to get it out without paying $5 in fees. Thanks to GDAX I can withdraw for free. Love sending people my Coinbase referral link now

I know what I'm asking Santa for this year.

Well no, it was a small buy order for when the price fell to $3,000 while it was $3,005, but it went up quickly to $3,700 later that day. Fees were less than $.20 I don't remember
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:18:24
I placed a buy order for $3,000 when it was $3,005 on Gemini. It never got filled.

4. ?????

Nice. These are the types of people that could help Bitcoin become more mainstream in America.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:19:12
I agree, but understanding the tech behind bitcoin is a pretty big undertaking. The steep learning curve contributes to the "early adopter" rhetoric. Understanding bitcoin as a protocol isn't the same as when you first learned to launch a web browser and download the Yahoo toolbar.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:04:57
Yeah, I see the potential and look forward to it. I just hate this topic of debate; this has been manipulated to the point of splitting the community and creating an altcoin that will undoubtedly confuse newcomers. This is something that shouldn't concern us. It doesn't affect Bitcoin's potential as a currency.
You want to be able to send your buddy $0.02 for making a funny Reddit comment and maintain a record of it forever? Use fucking Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:00:51
I was thinking of people giving me Bitcoin for no reason whatsoever
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:06:22
Yeah I think something needs to be done about the learning curve eventually. This is definitely one of the things inhibiting mass-adoption. If it weren't for the meteoric rise in value over the years, most people wouldn't even know about Bitcoin.

If you can't trust exchanges then never exchange it. Just use your Bitcoin to buy shit.
