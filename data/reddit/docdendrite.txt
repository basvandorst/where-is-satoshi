I enjoyed your article. I appreciated the tone you took in not overstating the evidence, and care you put into the conclusions and implications. It felt apparent that there are disclaimers in this story, and that there may be much more to the issue of authorship than is currently known.
Because of this, I pre-ordered your book. (It was an e-copy of course - a physical book about digital money seems contradictory.) Really looking forward to the read now. Best of luck.

There's an obligation for them to support BCC on Day 1? Imagine that - anyone who copies the publicly available blockchain obligates Coinbase to support their altcoins immediately? Certainly not! Their position is that BCC is non-notable and therefore not going to be supported. That is legally defensible today, tomorrow, and probably for the next six months. HOWEVER, should BCC become notable then I believe Coinbase would add support as their legal positioning would degrade. But that's only ***if*** the notability transpires in the future.

Sorry to tell you this, but it's July 30th. Your property doesn't exist yet since the fork happens August 1. But guess what I did last night? I copied the blockchain and inputted the ledger into a new altcoin called TESTING1567COIN. I hereby DEMAND Coinbase support withdrawal of TESTING567COIN by September 1 because it's my property after all.  So if they don't allocate computer engineers to do this at their own expense, I will sue.
Sounds about right?

I surmise their rationale is the same as mine. I withdrew 100% of my BTC yesterday leaving 100% of my ETH untouched on Coinbase.
Why did I do this? I want immediate access to BCC on their blockchain on August 2nd. I may sell it, or hold, or trade.  I wouldn't want to wait for support from Coinbase to come only after the customer outcry and demand.
EDIT: Just to add that once the fork is complete I'll likely transfer back into Coinbase. I do appreciate their service as a private smalltime investor.

Terrific! I hereby offer you (or anyone else for that matter, including my mother) one or more TESTING1567COINs for the price $300 dollars per unit. (No need to send me payment today because I'll invoice you as I'm a very forgiving merchant that allows 90 days for remittance.)
The trade is confirmed as of July 31st. The last known market price of TESTINGCOIN1567 is now $300 and this price will be reflected on trading boards that track this currency moving forward.  Now if I, or you, or my mother decides to sell more or less of these coins, the price quote could change. But given that I hold all the coins, it's quite easy for me to fix the price to be non-zero.
Anyway, we should proceed with the lawsuit against Coinbase immediately. They still haven't offered support and I debuted this coin two days ago already.

No this is not correct and is legally dubious. Coinbase is a respectable institution acting in *good faith* for their investors. Their policy on this withdrawal is to help reduce support for BCC. They need to commit to one Bitcoin blockchain and not provide any incentive for these types of forks moving forward. My guess in that should BCC gain traction and be sustainable in the future they would eventually add support allowing withdrawals. I mean if they didn't, the outcry from their investors would be deafening.

It took me 12 hours yesterday. My guess is the wait is about 12-18 hours now.
