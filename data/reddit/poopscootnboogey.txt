They are all saying this because Bitcoin and other alts are eating their lunch.  If Bitcoin ultimately succeeds, almost 1/2 of the banking industry will be out of work.  Just let that sink in...

Please post the transaction ID
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:44:15
I’d be looking to confirm the transaction was legitimate and also to make sure he walker you’re sending it to was the correct one. It’s all public info. You can check this out on Blockchain.info for yourself.

Shout out to everyone who sold around 11,800 like me and realized that money would have an added value of 500 by now.  :(  HURRY GDAX.  PROCESS MY DEPOSIT SO I CAN BUY BACK IN.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:58:20

He’s making light of the phrase “I’m not gay, but $20 is $20!”  But BTC-izing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:29:57
But is it actually illegal to trade BTC with someone?  
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:12:25
You’ll be fine. Hit the refresh button and it should update. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:45
If it makes you feel a little better, I was stupid and cashed out at 11.8k only to wake up this morning to 13.3k.  Yikes.  Cashing back in asap.  GDAX needs to hurry the F up with my deposit.

I know a lot of people are talking about donations to technology organization and / or charitable organizations but if you’d like to send donations to the university I work for specifically for use in the Performing Arts Center that would be awesome. There are a few thriving performing art programs there and I’m trying to update the very outdated lighting system they have!

Bro, your steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:42:56
Do you have your transaction ID?  I would be happy to poke around and see what’s up.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:06
Do I get a BTC tip if I say it's still good for wiping buttholes?

Well... that lasted a total of 4 minutes before everybody f'd up their trade servers.  Nicely done.

Same. Bought my BTC for $7,455 a coin. Only bought $525 but it hasn’t even processed yet. *sigh*. Everyday just is killing me watching it plummet right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:41:05
Yeah. It’s like the nuclear bomb of banking. It’s been created, it has massive power and it can’t be undone. We have it around (and others could have their own too) to make sure certain people/places/organizations aren’t being dicks to everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:42:25
Wait... you can tip people bitcoin on reddit?!  What a time to be alive!

You deserve some serious karma. You changed that persons life with bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:42:45
I don’t believe it!  Try it again, send me 1 BTC and show us the same fee! ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:00:20
I have a very small amount of BTC but I feel the same way of what you’re describing. 
I was told a story a long time ago about a man who had a ton of money in the stock market back in the 20s. He was getting his shoes shined and a 13 year old boy was trying to give him stock advice. He asked the boy more about it and he said his mother had money in the stock market and so did his grand parents, etc. The man then went and withdrew all of his money because people that have no idea what they are doing are getting invested and knew it was going to collapse. I guess then the stock market crashed a few months later. 
There’s a ton of “just buy it and hang on for the ride”. Makes me worry everybody will hype in and then bail when they lose interest or feel they aren’t making enough money. 
Wish I would have bought more BTC when it was in the $5000 range, but I’m trying to stay very connected to the atmosphere around it all.
