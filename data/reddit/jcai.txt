Then let's suppose the creator/s is in it purely for the greater advancement but it doesn't change the fact that there are the malicious few. If hackers, whose motives for getting into bitcoin is just purely greed then the few largest holders could get together and once again the markets will be controlled by a few individuals. But this definitely belongs in r/showerthoughts

noob question, how do you set up this chart? Im just barely starting to understand the fundamentals of technical analysis, any help would be appreciated.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:40:18

Nothing much right now but hopefully it will hit the markets this year. I remember the Winklevosses submitted it to the S.E.C. late last year. Hopefully it will hit the markets before winter time.

i dont mind having that at first, it dose ease the general public into the way the look at bitcoin again. And through the public exchanges, ALOT more people will hear about bitcoins even more.

Damn lucky you... I am sad to say that convinced about the survival of bitcoin a little too late, sorry guys. But now I am happy to say that I'm FULLY on board with this ride.

see maybe the reason people are not willing to use it because its too volatile right now, i know i am. i could buy a cup of coffee and AS i am drinking that cup the price of that cup could go up and down. so with the government stepping in and regulating this then the "general public" would be safer using this. but i dont know man im just in this before the feds steps in

i did but the thing this lets say IF btc goes up to 100,000usd/btc(not likely) and there is someone out there holding 144341btc (true) then thats 1.4 trillion, thats almost a countries gdp. if the goverment doesnt set in then this could collaspse the world economy, no?
