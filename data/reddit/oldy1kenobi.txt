If it didn't mean that before then it should now.

My two eldest boys are not yet teens and they have seen it :)

First caption would have been my dad in the 80's or me just without the beard and grey hair.

Not illegal, I don't want to spoil his business by actually sending people elsewhere, Google is your friend or you could even PM to ask if you really want to know that badly.

Interesting but the prices are way too expensive, I can buy most of those games for much cheaper with Doge or BTC anyway
Example: 11 Euro for The Walking Dead when Steam current sale price is just over 8 Euro and I can buy it outside of Steam for even less.

Wont give you the companies here but you can buy steam wallet cards with BTC and more, I use one site in particular because they use coinpayments.net to take payment and sell games reasonably cheap.

I never had that many but I got them when the price was maybe £300 and I used them to purchase stuff online, now I just sit here some evening thinking about what I could have had instead :(

Its easy to ask this kind of question when money is not something you worry about though, I'm in the same sort of situation, I have maybe £150 of BTC and cashing it out would be very useful to me right now but I also worry that BTC will keep rising after I sell :(

Nice little giveaway and nice big list of charities to give to ;)

See this is where your argument falls down, a lot of people are NOT investor's, they are USERS and if the coin becomes unusable for simple cheap transactions it loses it value to those users.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:02:00
But the whole problem is that fee's are no longer small to transmit quickly so your reply sounds like a copypasta.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:00:45
$99 extra in my wallet wouldn't really be a problem right now.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:39:46
Liberal? Not by a fucking long measure you moron, I don't expect free but BTC was never meant to be charging the fee's it does, just a case of greed from the majority and I fully hope it comes back to bite you all in the ass with the "I'm alright Jack" mentality I'm seeing.
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:47:57
I'd like to know how if my transaction of 0.01BTC hasn't moved yet with a bigger fee than you paid?
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:45:06
I'd settle for a billionth of that amount right now.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:08:51
Its no use just HODLing either, I want to use BTC but waiting in excess of 12 hours for confirms unless I'm willing to pay over 5% is NOT the way to encourage users, can't help but feel like the "little man" is being screwed yet again.

Oh I know, bought my LTC a few month ago in anticipation of this and am not disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:57:08
Oh I'm sure I will get a few negative comments and downvotes because of my opinion but something has to give, I paid over the default fee anyway and when I check what is the "best" transaction fee to use I see people paying up to 0.00200 BTC/KB which, for me, on a transaction of 0.01 is way too much,  please tell me how thats right because I'm comparing this to the net neutrality issue of ISP's providing better bandwidth to companies who pay for it over small companies who can't afford to :(

Well as Google refuse to let me pay in any other currency than UK Pounds then they have no chance.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:32:54
You say Cloudbet wont add your BTC but that's wrong as they have no control over the blockchain and as the other reply before me states, you paid so tiny a transaction fee I'm surprised you actually get any confirms at all.
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:41:02
OK I didn't do the math on it, thought it was at least in double figures.
