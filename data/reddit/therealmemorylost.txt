multisignature wallets with private keys on CD is "freaking retarded scheme"? hummm. you must be an Expert.
about feelings, as asked bruce schneier: "Is a feeling of safty wortha feeling of security?"
about feeling smart: better to feel smart and to be secured then to be an idiot who feels superior ;)

Much appreciated. 
Would please kindly agree on developing an argumentation?

Irrelevant to a certain extend only. spyware on hardware can be on the network interface card as well. (see layer one security for your persual  True as well this type of threat shouldn't apply to bitcoin wallets (but who knows! :) ) (agreed the computer for offline signature should contain a SSD and not a HDD) jokin

We could actually do an effort, and use paper &amp; pen for once... Old school hand writting.
You eliminate the printer issue, and make our Mums proud that we still do handwriting ;) 
("OMG! that's sooo inconvienient!! writing by HAND for 10 minutes is not worth it, especially if it's to safeguard my savings!" LoL)

why 2 wallets?
    1 for testing recovery, 1 for long term use. once you manage to transfer the 0.01btc from 1st multisig wallet to the 2nd, you can destroy the 1st set of cds.
why no redundancy?
because you don't need it. (except if you're not sure you know how to burn a cd, or except if you feel confortable with 6 different safe deposit boxs !!!)
re Data_decay of quality optical media (good quality cdrom): lol!! :) What is more likely? decay of (laminated) paper or cd?
Please develop your assertion that this scheme is not very safe nor convenient.
"Is runing GRsec kernel with jails and HIDS safe or convenient?" I believe multisignature wallets over (quality) cdrom is pretty safe and overall convenient.

Can you please quote the source of this information "60% of GDP"?
I don't know much about Africa and how we can help there.
I know a Kenyan telecom operator wanted to implement bitcoin in data over voice. (I know that at least Turkish operator plans to do the same : "coalition money")
Microcredits in crypto currencies will definitely be a plus for emerging economies. Sometimes all people need is few hundred dollars (let's say 1BTC) to start a business and live out of it. And with plenty of investors interest rates will tend to be low. Nothing forbids for microcredit schemes to be sharia compliant. 
Any way lot to be done &amp; promising. 
Thanks for the comments

Yeah. Greedy p2pool miners who enjoy the misery of others, and charge them high fees... lol...
It's true that the brick and mortar retail market of bananas in bitcoin is such that it can put in  jeopardy the stability of third world.

The difference is already well established in the EU, where their is "electronic money" (as in EMI Electronic Money Institution, fully regulated financial entity by the way) and "virtual currency" (like bitcoin or other crypto currencies). 
For the legal terminology. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:49:19
It depends on the hardware in new computer. China is known for supplying hardware with spyware inside (some old Western Digital HD..) ;)
So to be safe it would take to spread the funds by repeating the procedure over several distinct cold storage wallets, created with random approachs on distinct hardware ^^
It's the "cannari" approach described above, but on large scale.

Knowing how much Buffet hates speculators, I believe Munger calls "rats"those who purchase Bitcoins solely for speculative purpose.
given that Buffet disregard Bitcoin as an investment, this suggest as well that WE could be the ones called "rats".

Computer Security is usually a tradeoff between security and convenience. multisig safer but less convenient; grsec safer but less convenient; snort safer but less convenient; A-Z encryption safer but less convenient. Do you see a sequence emerging?..
By the way: 2 of 3 multisignature offers redundancy ^^ RTFM

Honest? 
I would horribly hesitate between sending them back &amp; making the best possible use of them through charity.
Then I would take the chance and choose charity.
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:34:44
well big guy... If you would know IT you would know a multisignature wallet on cds is safer then a single signature wallet on usb. (might even be more convenient...).
But it seems from your comments that you know insults more then IT... 
If pathetic for you fine for me "BigMoneyGuy" (you're a teenager right?)
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:21:19
Pro is that using p2pool is actually the best use you can do of your miners.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:52:34
seems to me it's like for all the rest: when it takes an effort you're out of the game BigMoneyGuy (what kind of alias is that by the way?) In respect to my education: IT at University in Geneva Switzerland, CISCO, BlackHat, and 25 years of practice in IT at the mean time (yes, I started on AppleII)

We kindly remind you that Bitcoin is an experiment.
It can fail.
cryptofinance is yet another experiment that includes the Bitcoin experiment. Cryptofinance is less likely to fail.
please see Ethereum, Open Transactions, or Zerocoin for your persual.

Buy 1 good GPU, 1 FPGA, and 1 very cheap USB ASIC miner (like the ANT). You will have enough to have fun, to run a full p2pool, merge mine, and experiment. You will always have alt use of the FPGA and obviously of the GPU (experiment on password cracking? )
After placing your order, create a 2 of 3 multisignature wallet, buy some coins with the rest of the cash, and hold tight to part of it.
That's what I would do.
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:39:31
we can read the manual and reach this conclusion.  Thank you.

Should it be a devcoin subproject?
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:38:01
Actually it does.
Both energy from the vacuum and bitcoin are technology topics.
Despite controversial, (but please check the author) energy from the vacuum is related to bitcoin as mining crypto currencies require a great amount of electricity. 
Miners have financial resources to promote research in energy, and as they would benefit from close to free energy they will soon or later.
I posted as comment that this topic could become a sub project of devcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:12:44
Very good. 
Boot on ram from livecd 
Create 2 multisignatures wallets (3 signatures is good).
Burn each private key (so 6 keys) to on 2 different sets cd (6 cd in total) (why not as qrcode.jpg), but in clear, not encrypted. Label the cds.
reboot and transfer 0.01 btc to the first multisignature wallet.
observe on blockchain.info that your wallet address starts by "3".
Recover the keys of your first set of cds and transfer the 0.01btc to the 2nd multisignature wallet.
If it works transfer the rest of your funds to the second multisignature wallet.
you just have to take care of physical security by storing the cds in 3 different sites. need only 2 of 3 keys (if you did things well) to access your funds.
safer then a "cold storage".
that's pretty safe.

 Oh I just understood. the spelling mistake! I ment to type "man". So your question mark right? ;) 
re my typo: I'm just lazy. and english is not my first language.
now their is a difference between laziness (I know: spelling...) and negligence. It's to be diligent than (or "then", even a bot gets the meaning anyhow) to use cd instead of paper, especially if you use an offline computer (for airgap). It's to be diligent to use multisignature for long term storage of funds. 
I don't care if you insult me or beleive that critisising my spelling &amp; typo leads somewhere. 
Pay me enough and I will provide you with first class presentations on cryptos that I would do myself (and without plagia), you could even call me bitch in addition if you can afford (I doubt that!). I would use that money to feed my two kids and my wife.
at the mean time you can go fuck yourself!
