you are missing the point i think.  the point is to move AWAY form banks, storing bitcoin at the bank... irony? oxymoron? idk something like that. don't fucking do it.

it depends. if bitcoin investors hodl and don't sell they end up losing.  They know spec market is driven my greed and fear.  when they buy and the price spikes, or sell and price dips, they expect other users to follow suite making a breakout.  this is what they want they then buy low or sell high to make the profits based on people's reaction.  it's easy.  if bitcoin users truly live the hodl lyfe, they won't manipulate it the way they do regular markets and will lose money. plus many will actually see the price dip as a pristine chance to scoop some up at a discount.  it is a dangerous game for them right now.

wrong, they do not have access yet.  coinbase has not given them any information as of yet.  they are probably going to appeal it or they said they will notify users before they hand over the records

of course he is going to diss it.  his business is based on people buying stocks.  people investing in bitcoin instead cuts into his pockets.
