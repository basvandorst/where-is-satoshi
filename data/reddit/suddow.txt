Sure, that is unfortunately very likely. What I've heard many hypothesize is that if bitcoin ends up taking over our current system, even partially then wealth could end up spreading more evenly, at least in the beginning. I truly hope this would happen since the wealthiest have been getting wealthier and wealthier than ever before over time.

Don't know what you're going to do with the money but please don't recklessly waste it :P
Consider holding at least some of the money, since it's nothing that you have budgeted anywhere, bitcoin is making big movements now and while there is always the chance that bitcoin will come crashing down. There's also the chance that by the end of the year your 2.5k might be more.
Anyway, I don't mean to tell you what to do, just to be careful about using it so you don't regret. I think I would have over 1 bitcoin now if someone had talked to me like this 2 years ago. Not that salty, I only wasted 0.4btc but still.

I'm no expert, but the difference here is inflation, our monetary system right now basically revolves around having inflation. Bitcoin does not.

EDIT: Anyway well done on helping out, I got many colleagues into Bitcoin too and one of them just cashed out for the money he put in 3 months ago so he was very happy :)

I can assure you it is an individual. I cashed out /s

Today you, tomorrow me. That would be so cool to see happening. I don't think people would want to start that because of lack of faith. You would have to trust the person to donate in the future

There are ways to run or install malicious code on your computer without needing admin rights. The site can also be a fake mirror, so it looks like gdax for example but isnt and then it steals your login credentials

And in their defense, they do mine some for themselves (at least that's what they said themselves). Having said that, I agree that considering cloud mining a total scam isn't wrong.

Also, the kid was probably having so much fun. I bet he told all his friends about it and showed that video.

Yes indeed it's bullshit. I could personally not work for the company, my morality couldn't take it knowing that I'm actively participating in a legal scam.

Why in the world would you do this? You can already send without a fee, you want to be a middleman?
If you need to ask what you need to install and how to create an API then you're the wrong person to even do this.
EDIT: I misspoke a little, of course there is the sending fee that goes to miners, I specifically meant a fee as in what banks take. Also lightning is even cheaper.

I think I've used binance for about 2 years.
Great if it's working fine for you, their UI looks nice, the usability of their site is quite poor but I guess it's acceptable or at least workable.
Their customer service is atrocious, pray you don't need to deal with them. I've repeated myself several times to them but it seems their customer service either doesn't read the e-mails or don't understand English.
I know I'm not native but my written English is perfectly understandable.

Thanks. The biggest problems I have are trust and usability.
It's was such a frustrating experience using their site that I had to contact their support and I didn't have high expectations for it but it was beyond useless.
Very clearly copy pasted text and nothing that was useful for me, much of it was in fact unrelated.
I've been doing the exact same thing on Kraken too and found it much more usable and in the same exact scenario I didn't get locked out.
Kraken support wasn't the best either but at least they read what I wrote (I've been in contact with them regarding something unrelated to the cases I've explained earlier).
Something of note too is that on Binance I was moving 30$ worth of btc and on Kraken I regularly move hundreds of dollars worth of coins.
The finnish company Prasos has also been great but it's not a trading site/service like this. Still wanted to point out that their support has been superb so far at least. 
I suppose most people aren't too interested in this but I was so annoyed that I felt I had to speak up about it, I don't want to accept such poor service, I mean they might as well not have answered me at all.
But ohh well, case closed I suppose. I'll just take my money and business elsewhere and that's that :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:27:49
I'll start off with the last paragraph because I think you're absolutely right. Not everyone is cut out for jobs, basically any available jobs in the future, not even close.
I don't want to get too deep into the conversation regarding tax because it's so complex, we really can't just compare the "high level average tax rate" of 50 vs 30 because that's not the whole truth.
I'll try keeping it to short examples and phrases instead to get the idea across.
Sure our tax is higher, no doubt about it. But it gets us a lot of services and support for free or *free, these services are worth money and quite a lot of it frankly.
We get paid maternity and paternity leave, I don't recall the exact amount but it is over a year of leave total between the parents.
Education is not only free, but in most cases you will be paid for studying. If you're frugal enough then you can get by on that money, it wont be luxurious or anything. But compare that to the US where student debt is rampant and unfortunately in many cases crippling.
Parents also receive a small sum every month per child to help with the expenses of raising a child. It's roughly 110$/child/month, not much but it definitely helps.
Free dental care for underage people.
And so much more, I honestly don't have time to list everything I want. My point is that it's not exactly comparable like that, because our higher tax rate doesn't mean we have less money at the end of the month and still have to pay for things like you do.
The size of the country doesn't really matter all too much does it? I mean sure, we have less people to pay for but that directly correlates with how many people we have that pay for things, same as you. Which is why everything is usually calculated per capita and not the total amount.
US military spending is so crazy I'm always wondering why people accept it as it is? But every time I bring this up it gets so political and opinion based that I dislike discussing it online.
The following points are purely subjective so take them as you will.
I believe the US could improve the living standards of the population by fixing that clusterfuck of an issue that is prisons. Prisons are a business in America that some assholes are pocketing big time and it's incredibly sad how many lives get destroyed as a consequence.
Another huge thing to improve is your medical system. Uninsured you'll be killed by the slightest of things as if it were the middle ages and even insured you can get yourself in a pickle if you get injured somewhere where there isn't a hospital that's covered by your insurance.
Treatable things are killing Americans by the thousands. I think the US and Finland could take some examples from France on how proper democracy is done /s
*free= (I mean that it's basically free, total cost being under 100$ like a hospital visit for example, you can stay for several days and it wont cost over 100$)

There's been some UBI trials done in the EU including Finland recently, and I heard (on the radio while on my way to work) that those trials went surprisingly well.
We might just be overly afraid of change, like how people are afraid of bitcoin because it's unknown etc.
Whatever the case, it's super interesting to see what the solution will be and how we manage to adapt.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:21:17
I don't remember the specifics of it so I wont talk out of my ass and I don't have the article at hand right now (it's not in English anyway).
But one thing I want to point out that keep a more open mind. I hear a lot about welfare and other government services in the US and they are atrocious. In the US you have too many issues regarding inmates, welfare, medical services, military spending and the list goes on.
Just because welfare in the US is almost as bad as it can get, doesn't mean it's that bad around the world.
I wont say we are without our issues in the nordics but I would not become homeless if I was fired from my job because we have a welfare system that works and a government that arguably cares about its people.
Also even completely uninsured, I would not die of cancer. Finland has some of the best statistics in the world in fighting off cancer.

I was told that it was due to me trying to send 30$ in bitcoin from an IP/computer that I had not previously used with their service. But that shouldn't really matter since I used 2FA and verified the device through an e-mail message.
But I see why it happened, these kinds of sites don't have fancy algorithms like google and other large companies.
You're thinking logically, but a company with many moving parts isn't always working 100% logically.
