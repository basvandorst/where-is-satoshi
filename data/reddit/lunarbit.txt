I don't think the feds trusted the state to get it right and it could have had implications for the federal case we just wrapped up if they made a mistake.  The state would have had to prove that Ross was DPR in order to prove the murder-for-hire, which means the feds would have had to turn over all of that evidence to the state and trust them to get it right.  Now they have established Ulbricht is DPR and the state doesn't have much they can screw up.

Yes, it was presented as evidence in several forms, personal diary, chat logs and evidence of the payment for the hit.

The fact remains that the evidence of the murder-for-hire was presented at the trial.  If you believe Ross is guilty of creating and running the Silk Road based on the evidence presented, then how can you ignore the murder-for-hire evidence that was also presented at this trial?  The Jury arrived at their verdict based on the evidence, so we can conclude that they believed the evidence to be valid based on the verdict.

But the evidence was and he was found guilty based on the evidence.

They have to be doing it knowingly.  If you find cocaine on eBay and report it to eBay and they take no action to stop it, then you have a case against eBay.  eBay does not partition its website to allow illegal activity while Silk Road was partitioned exclusively for illegal activity.

This is so cringe worthy coming from you.  You're ignoring that the evidence of Ross Ulbricht trying to have people murdered was presented at the trial and he was found guilty based on the evidence presented.  Evidence that includes the conspiracy to commit murder.  You look like an old man trying to fit in with the young crowd by saying stupid shit that ignorant kids like to hear.

non-violent crimes?  Have you been following the case?  Ross tried to have people murdered.

OpenBazaar is not truly decentralized and that is why it won't compete for SR business.  The devs will be ~~obligated~~ *compelled* to filter listings.

Yep, the trial hasn't started but some of the evidence was presented at this trial and he was found guilty based on the evidence presented.

Ross Ulbricht is a proven liar.  He has lied to the people closest to him so that they will have a better opinion of him.  This came out in this trial.  So what you have presented is just more evidence of that behavior, the desire to be seen as something that he in practice isn't.

The Maryland case will happen soon: 
  
The evidence for the murder-for-hire charges was presented in this trial as evidence in the form of his diary, chat logs ordering the hit and the blockchain transaction for payment of said hits.  He was found guilty in this trial based on the evidence provided.

He had the option to take the stand, he chose to keep quiet.

In 2010 someone paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas.  Those 10k BTC are now worth $2,250,000.  You can buy a lot of pizza and cats for $2,250,000.  In some places you can probably buy cat pizzas too.
  
Sorry, the metaphor was too hard. :)

That small batch of mushrooms was over 10lbs.  I guess small is subjective..

That is not true.  The evidence was presented at this trial and the Jury's verdict is based on the evidence presented.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:50:17
Erik,  the murder-for-hire evidence was presented at the trial.  The Jury deliberated and came to their verdict based on the evidence presented.  You would only be right if the murder-for-hire evidence was not presented.

They did, you just didnt google hard enough.

It's not up to him to judge and to protect them, he is not a god.  The customers made their own choices and put themselves at risk through their own decisions.  Ross could have shut it down and walked away but he didn't.

No, *I am Spartacus*.

Do you consider Ross Ulbricht to have good morals?
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:03:19
He probably felt bad about trying to have people killed too. /s

You find blackmail more deplorable than murder?  You have some issues if that is the value judgement you arrive at.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:03:56
He was convicted based on the evidence and the murder-for-hire was a part of that evidence.  But yea, he will be standing trial for the murder for hire separately.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:27:53
non-violent crimes? Have you been following the case? Ross tried to have people murdered.
