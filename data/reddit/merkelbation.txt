Well, this seems wrong. Paris has had several attacks the past three years, and even more in France as a whole. If you lump Paris in with European cities like London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels and Berlin, then maybe you could make a statistical case for saying "no particular risk." But there have been no attacks in many other European cities like Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest. It's not clear what the difference is, but there's clearly a higher risk in the first list of cities (including Paris) than in the second list. The cities on that second list are also very beautiful and culturally interesting, and worth a visit. For people planning a trip to a European city, it's probably good to keep these cities in mind.

They're not allowed to report it in France.

Yes. Just like the UK police knew about Rotherham for years.
The sad truth is, the government gets more power if the terrorist attack happens. They're largely not trying to stop them. There are perverse incentives at work.
Fortunately, there's an easy way to avoid terrorism. Just check out the demographics of different places around the world and then move to an appropriate place. Britain is not one of those places.
As a great Brit once said long ago, "We must be mad, literally mad..."

If you're Jewish you probably should hide it. You don't want to end up like Ilan Halimi. Or the Jews at that deli in Jan 2015. Or Jewish schoolkids in France in 2012:
Assuming you're not Jewish, you'll probably be fine.

Thanks for suggesting people look through my history. (It's not very long.) I did it myself. Lot of truth in there. But I did get a few things wrong, I admit, so I can see why you might think I have some credibility issues. Quote from my first ever comment:


Obviously I'm wrong. Sorry about that. Angela Merkel is totally hot and lots of people have wanted to have sex with her. In fact, she's probably lost count of the rape attempts she's fought off with her secret Judo skills.
