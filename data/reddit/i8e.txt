There are pools providing these options and the user has the ability to choose these pools, your assumptions are wrong.


If a few hundred trusted block generators are in use then you have the same problem as today. Hashers outsourcing block creation because its too expensive.
Originally it was thought that miners could have SPV security and fraud proofs could be given to them by full nodes, which is similar to your security model without the same Sybil problems, however fraud proof arent easy. When fraud proofs are easy, outsourcing block creation will be a bit more safe, however it isn't right now.

There was some discussion about it a few months back on the mailing list regarding splitting validation of different sidechains between miners and them providing fraud proofs to each other. If somehow this problem was solved it would be much better than trusting a set of full nodes, which I believe would leave us where we are today. Unfortunately there are many different types of fraud that are easy to create and expensive to prove.

Payout variance reduction doesn't require you to outsource block creation. It doesn't matter much if a pool "has" 35% of the network hashrate if they control 0% of block creation.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:26:39
There seems to be a disconnect between the two camps. No one thinks that larger than 1MB blocks are impossible to work with. People will run still run full nodes even if their cost multiplies by 16 (the max it should multiply by in the next year if gavins fork succeeds).
The question isn't whether someone can afford a full node, its whether they have an incentive to. So, what incentives does a miner have to run a full node rather than outsource that job to another party? Well, the network is more secure making both the Bitcoins he has and the Bitcoins he is to gain slightly more valuable, and he has full node security. 
The cost of a full node is relatively little, probably somewhere between $5 and $15 for our current 500KB block average. With that cost we currently have a mining ecosystem in which a handful of miners have a majority. These miners have decided individually that they should run a full node rather than outsource that cost to a third party, mostly because benefitting the network benefits them. Now if running a full node were cheaper we could expect more miners to run full nodes rather than outsourcing block creation to a third party.
Every miner has a cost at which they will start or stop running a full node. Larger miners have a larger stake in the network and will run them at higher costs. Remember, the question is not whether they can run a full node, I'm sure the vast majority of miners *can* run a full node, but why should they when it costs more to run a full node than it increases Bitcoins utility and their moneys value.
As full node costs increase, it is fair to assume miners with smaller hashrate and smaller unrealized gains will have the same or nearly the same benefits from running a full node, but greater costs. In the end this means that less miners will run full nodes and more miners will delegate their hashing power to a large miner who will generate the blocks for them.
 In the end yes, you can have larger blocks, and you can have everyone running SPV clients, but if the mining ecosystem is worse than it is today, or even stays as bad as it is today for an extended period, Bitcoin isn't sufficiently trustless and has little or no advantage over some centralized and trust requiring by design alternative.

It can be, GBT and P2Pool exist. The problem is the cost of full nodes. It cant be outsourced to other full nodes without requiring another form of trust and causing Sybil problems.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:31:42


Yes, the tools are there and people aren't using them. The reason is costs.
They cant outsource block creation to any full node, "any" full node could steal their block reward. "Any" full node leads to a sybil problem where you can gain hashrate by just running a bunch of full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:13:26
Enforcing block size limits is necessary for a safe Bitcoin. If Bitcoin could be secure with massive blocks and miners were fine with large expenses and losses then increasing the block size would be fine.
Also there isn't a fee market, plenty of 0 fee transactions are included because there isnt as much demand as supply.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:45:41
As long as you don't have full nodes running on the pool members ends, they have no way of even determining what is in the block. Ignoring that, there are plenty of miners that have &gt;1% without pools.
Also, your numbers of 1% pools are way off, on average they find a block once per day at least.

This is incorrect. Someone with 0.1% of the stake designated to win the next block is basically guaranteed the next block, therefore, they are guaranteed success in a Finney attack. Someone with 0.1% of the hashrate in PoW has a 0.1% chance of winning and can only increase their E[X] by 0.1% rather than 100% with PoS.

You are comparing things that aren't consensus systems to a consensus system. With a specification you can afford to have 1/1000000 web pages render differently and a specification allows for a low, but non-zero number of conflicting pages. In a consensus system the specification must be the code if you want to have working consensus and avoid fake conf attacks.

Requiring a fee to be based on PoW and not having miners as intermediaries means everyone who makes a tx either has a mining rig or has a PoW that can trivially be reversed by those who do. 10 minutes of transactions is as secure as a 10 minute block if the "fee" (PoW used) is as strong as the PoW miners would use. This means TaPoW would outsource security to miners if the tx wanted any security at all. Sure, you can build a PoW on top of tx any arbitrary insecure, but to stop an attacker from trivially spamming the network, you need some minimum PoW meaning miners would dominate the blockchain leading to TaPoW being just an unoptomized version of what we have with Bitcoin.

You are confusing me with your use of hard fork, do you mean a consensus split? Because whether a hard fork is desirable is another issue.


No one is arguing for a single bitcoin implementation. Go ahead and play with the networking code, the wallet, the transaction formation, the API, etc. The consensus code should always evaluate the same, that is critical. This is why I don't think reimplementing consensus code is a good idea. The purpose of writing a new client, generally, should be to have some new behavior. Since the behavior of the blockchain evaluation should always be the same, consensus code either needs to be rewritten in a way that is guaranteed to evaluate the same way, or not rewritten at all.

No, your wallet chooses enough of your inputs to spend to make the transaction large enough. For example, if each of my addresses allow me to spend the following amounts,
address A = 0.1
address B = 0.1
address C = 0.1
address D = 0.1
and I want to send Bob 0.15, my transaction won't have A, B, C and D as inputs and Bob = 0.15, E = 0.25 as my outputs, rather it will have some selection of the two (B and C for example). My inputs will be B and C and my outputs with be Bob = 0.15, E = 0.05.

No need, everything you say here can be refuted with the research I have done beforehand.


The winner of the next block is determined by the block a few hundred back (IIRC 1440). Since a block is can be formed nearly infinite ways by the block winner, they can grind the block until they produce a block that causes them to be the winner of the future block.
Blocks not being able to reorg more than 720 back isn't a security feature, its a consensus breaker. It makes it so breaking consensus only requires feeding someone 721 blocks at some point in history. This can be done with some old private keys. If I know someone who had 50k NXT 10 months back, and the forging power of the network was 5 million NXT at the time, then I can generate 720 blocks (while waiting an average of 100 times as long as the winner on the main chain). I don't actually have to wait this long, I just have to forge the timestamps so they reflect this time period. This attack allows me to break consensus with anyone not up to date from that time and the cost is buying private keys from people who used to have a stake in NXT (but may not anymore).

If you're not using blind signatures, then there is no way to prevent someone from seeing you associating your old input with your new output.

The PoS PDF is broadly defined and explains the fundamental problems with PoS. Specifically, I think the most harmful attack to NXT for the least cost is stake grinding. Because the winning block can be changed without cost, a block can be ground so it is determined that the winner is yourself.

ASIC resistance leads to centralization and it is impossible to prevent the creation of ASICs. Eventually an ASIC will come along that does a good job at computing each these deterministically generated hashing algorithms. Maybe it will only be a 50% increase in efficiency, but mining will reach an equilibrium where only those with an ASIC are profiting and those CPU mining are 67% as efficient (with the 50% increase assumption) and are spending a dollar on electricity for every $0.67 gained.

Please consider some attack vectors rather than claiming it is secure without consideration. Those numbers don't really mean much. What matters is miners make about 25btc per block. Let's say a miner bets 100btc on a bet where they have an 50% chance of winning 200btc. If they make a block that is in that 50% range where they lose then they have the choice of gaining 25btc to lose the bet (a value of 25btc) or to throw away the block, reset the bet and have an 50% chance of winning again (a value of 100btc (this number is from 50% odds * 200btc)). The miner has just increased their expected earnings by 75btc just by witholding this block.
Hopefully this narrow example, which can be applied with many different sets of parameters has demonstrated a lack of security in this option.

I wouldn't be surprised is btcd and bitcoinj broke consensus between the two. You are comparing protocols where one "miscommunication" means a slight amount of incompatibility or a little bit of data that has to be resent. Bitcoin is unique in that it is the first distributed consensus. Consensus is **very** fragile. Two different languages will handle some strange edge case in a slighly unexpected way, and bam, consensus is broken. The best you can do is accept that these edge cases exist and have your program evaluate these edge cases in the same way.

Here is a relevant graph. Yes, it is at around $40/tx. 
This number is probably a bit lower in reality because there are off-chain transactions. (Perhaps halving the total transaction cost)
There are also a number of factors that will lower this. Right now, we are still in a period where 6% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist are being produced every year (a lot of inflation). When the rewards halve again, so will the cost per transaction. (Halving the total transaction cost)
In the near future we will probably reach 1mb blocks (about twice as many transactions per block meaning half the price per transaction) 
(Halving the transaction cost)
Once we reach 1mb, miners wont be able to put just and transaction in the block. They will be putting the transactions with the highest fee/kb in, meaning people will bid for on-chain transactions and increase the real tx-fee. This will lead to both centralized off-chain transactions (with web wallets) and decentralized, trustless, off-chain transactions [(ultimate blockchain compression)]( lowering the cost per transaction again.
**TL;DR:** The cost per tx onchain is $40, including offchain, it's probably $10-$30. Reward halving, an increase in the number of tx, and trustless offchain tx will lower the cost per tx significantly.

A hash cash doesn't force you to pay the nodes, it only forces you to do work every time you talk to a node. It also opens up a few attack vectors due to the fact that specialized hardware can solve hashes much faster than GPUs.

You don't have to wait. You can just request that your file be added to the merkle tree and it's done. Once a block comes around, the root can  be added to a transaction. Next time a block comes around after that your files is proven to have existed because you can show that your file was used to construct the tree.
It is different from zipping because instead of needing every file used in the construction for proof you only need your file and log(N) hashes (where N is the number of files being proven).

That is incorrect. Clients just don't accept reorgs larger than a day, which for obvious reasons is a consensus breaking risk. If not accepting a large reorg was a good security measure, every currency would disallow reorgs larger than two blocks, since after all 2 blocks would mean your were perfectly confirmed right? However by having the "consensus feature" of not allowing reorgs, the mechanism used to get you onto the correct chain, NXT risks the consenus splitting.


And I explained to you that the thread didn't debunk stake grinding, it merely corrected a very slight misunderstanding someone had about the workings of NXT (your signature doesnt determine the next blocks winner, it determines the block 720 in the futures winner). Because someone who has been designated to be "first to win" the block, they can modify the block they will be signing over and over (similar to mining) until their signature is formed so that they are first in line for the block 720 in the future where they can repeat the grinding.

Edit: I should mention that this is trust less (you cannot rig it AND the winner is guaranteed to get paid), not just provably fair (meaning you would only know that you were being defrauded while fraud still could happen).
Those sources are both manipulatable and poorly defined. If you want to make a trustless bet, there is a proposed scheme I like. Basically alice and Bob generate random numbers and hash them, give each other their hashes and pay to a transaction that is redeemable after they both reveal their random values. If their random values concatenated and hashed (or some non-hash function is performed on the two values to generate a pseudorandom unpredictable number) is less than some designated value Alice wins, else Bob wins.
This transaction pays to *someone*. That someone is unknown until they both reveal their random numbers. The random numbers are included in a redeem script that proves that they are the exchanged hashes preimages (so one party can't pretend the other parties random value was something its not.
Once both parties release their random values the tx can execute automatically.

The propagation time is the sum of the latency and time to transfer the data. More blocks per minute means more of the propagation time is caused by the total latency rather than the transfer time sum. In other words, lowering the block time proportional to the block size means the amount of time spent receiving data relative to time between blocks will be the same, however when you consider the sum of the latencirs between nodes, it is constant regardless of block size. This means 1/50th the block size means 50 times the (latency)/(block time) therefore more reorgs and a weaker consensus are the results of a blockchain with the same number of mb/minute and more blocks/minute.

After a double spend and broken consensus maybe. He could also partition the network and destroy the currency.


Unfortunately, their software doesn't ask the user for permission. Also, he could partition the network so half was working on one chain half another without it looking like a reorg.


No, the junk chains can be made using 0.0000001%  of the work the network has done. For the junk chain to become the main chain, the network would have to redo 99.999999% of the work on that chain.

As you said, miners will end up living in areas where electricity is cheap.

I assume most of the dogecoin users are there because they saw someone advertising it somewhere. The reason people advertise it is to increase the price. This is fine as long as you have a reason to build the ecosystem and there isn't already a signifiantly more established cryptocurrency that has technical advantages (no random block rewards, SHA2, competent dev team).

Also, I specified "functional" for a reason. The main hurdle behind a real coinjoin implementation is preventing flooding and preventing snooping, neither of which V3.5 do. It just broadcasts to everyone in your pool a coinjoin request, which lets anyone snooping associate inputs and outputs.

Do you expect me to know what the future difficulty will be?
According to  the network is growing by 1%/day meaning each day your profits decay be 1%. That 1% will fall, but i will go with the assumption it doesnt. The sum of .99^x for x from 0 to 300 (days) is about 95. In other words you can expect 95 times your first day profit if you mine for 300 days. The antminer s3 gives you 440gigahash/s for $380.
On the day the antminer was released, the network was at a difficulty that would have given you abiut $5.00 on the day it was shipped to you. $5*95 = $475 &gt; $380

I agree that the anonymity set would be different.

Storage capacity may be increasing, but it is not necessarily increasing relative to price fast enough to scale with Bitcoin. Yes, the blockchain can be pruned to some extent, and it is a bit of a sloppy solution, but trustless offchain transactions can be 100% pruned, so it is the best solution.


Darkcoin isn't changing the protocol. They are adding a coinjoining network to the reference client. A Bitcoin client could do the same with no fork required. Essentially, they have put people on a new network unnecessarily. Generally when you don't have a functional reason to put people on a new network, you are putting people on a new network so the founders can make money.

This is not good news. The last thing we need is a centralized service holding 1 million customers bitcoins. Have we forgotten the events of just **two** days ago? One successful large scale attack and all those users have their coins gone.
A competent company wouldn't be safe, let alone a company that hasn't learned that it's bitcoin client implementation is heavily flawed after it failing multiple times. A Bitcoin dev, Peter Todd has broken their consensus multiple times by simply making a transaction that it doesn't know how to handle. The simple solution is to use the reference client, but for some reason they refuse to. The fact that they continuously patch their flawed client indicates that they aren't technically competent and shouldn't be trusted. There may be other ways to attack Coinbase that they don't know about.
TL;DR: Don't let a competent company hold your coins and especially don't let an incompetent company hold your coins.

No they don't. Full nodes see the mainchain. You can also have a full node on the alt-chain, but it isn't required. To get the offchain tx on the mainchain, a miner has to verify the alt-chains tx, meaning they have to temporarily have the altchain. The only thing a full node has to see is any headers used to move the altchains tx onto the mainchain.

A randomly chosen hashing algorithm is still vulnerable to specialized hardware because people are going to need to know which set of algorithms they're going to have to choose from.

@_date: 2014-08-28 18:23:53
Yes, if we didn't have checkpoints, some ASIC owner could create an alternate history (where the difficulty remains low) and every block is 1mb. This wouldn't be the tallest chain (because the most work wasn't done), but it would give new network members 100+gb of data to process, possibly multiple times. An alternative to checkpoints is to download block headers then transactions when initiating which means an attacker can only feed you 80 bytes per block rather than 1mb.

Is this myth coming up again? 0-conf tx can't be determined to be safe based on network propogation. 99.999% of full nodes having the tx doesn't determine that there is a 99.999% chance miners will use that tx. Miners are free to include double spend transactions not propagated by the network.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:25:51
We could drop the fees even more, but that would cause even more transactions to be created to the point that we have 1mb blocks. Once we hit 1mb, people will be bidding with their fees to have their transaction included and what "we" drop fees to won't matter.

Let's pretend you're playing with your friends. You all have lollipops and you want to keep track of how many each of you have. You each have dozens of them and don't want to carry all of them. So you put all of your lollipops in a basket and mark on a piece of paper:
    Bobby (writes in blue): 40 lollipops
    Alex (writes in red): 34 lollipops
    Sammy (writes in green): 65 lollipops
    Beth (writes in black): 24 lollipops
You all decide to keep a copy of the paper and whenever you make a "transaction" you will mark it on each others paper. Each of your friends are given a marker of a certain color to verify that only they can make the transfer.
Sam wants to give Beth 3 lollipops as a birthday present, so he writes in green "Bobby gives Beth 3 lollipops" on everyones paper. Alex and Sammy both look at their paper and agree that because Beth was given 3 lollipops that she has 27 now and Bobby has 37.
Collectively they establish the rule that everyone should say how many lollipops they want to give and every day they will meet up and write down the transfers.
After a while they begin distributing lollipops to their other friends, "Jake", "Mike", etc. They begin to need more paper to keep track of everyones lollipops.
One day Bobby says "One day is too long to wait!" Sammy says "I don't want to meet more than once a day, that's too much work!". Bobby says "That's okay." He then writes on everyones paper "Bobby pays 5 lollipops to the sidechain". He then takes a camera, takes a picture of what he has written and glues it on a fresh piece of paper titled "sidechain".
Jake and Alex agree to keep track of the sidechain as well and meet four times per day to update the papers.
All your friends now have their lollipops kept track of on the sidechain and the original stack of papers (mainchain).
One day Jake decides to move 2 lollipops onto the mainchain to pay Beth. He writes on the sidechain "Paying 2 lollipops back to the mainchain". He then takes a picture what he has written and glues it onto the original stack.
There have been hundreds of lollipop transfers on the sidechain to get those lollipops to Jake, but only a few were needed on the mainchain.

The sidechains have their block headers added to the mainchain. It is up to the miners to determine whether to include blocks from a scrypt sidechain in the blockchain. If they do include it, then 51%+ of the miners need to agree that the blocks are from a valid sidechain. 
In other words, a LTC altchain might not automatically work with the sidechain implementation, but making it work would be a softfork (if it wasn't already included in the sidechain softfork).

Okay, now its clear what you're saying. It's not the number of transactions but the stake in those transactions. The original argument was that delegates would collude and force a large reorg. To force a large reorg, they will need to make the original N blocks in such a way that they can have more stake in their reorg fork. This would involve setting up all your original transactions in a block, generating the other N-1 blocks on top of it then forcing a large reorg using their delegate power and the stake they're doublespending with. The difference in bitcoin mining is 10% of the network can't force a 10 block reorg every 100 blocks, they can force a reorg every 100,000 blocks on average and at the same time a miner would be giving up every block reward they could have earned by not trying to force a reorg. On other words, it is costly to try to force a reorg, in fact attempting such a reorg with 10% of the network would cost that 10% 2,500,000btc while trying.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:36:53


With everyone running the software already, a 6 block reorg would be trivial. If the network stopped accepting the checkpoints, it would be after the attack, they wouldnt be able to change the software during the seconds the reorg is happening.

Yes, Blackcoin does have automatic centralized checkpointing. It cannot work without it. Here is the source:
You will notice that there is no automatic checkpointing code in Bitcoin because it doesn't need it:


In Bitcoin it is not "validating all blocks by one single entity", but in Blackcoin and Peercoin checkpoints can be broadcasted like alert messaged and automatically applied.


They aren't obligated, but they will be isolated from everyone running the reference peercoin client if they chose not to.

No, I was discussing the cost of making a worthless bitcoin fork to DoS attack someone. It was part of the explanation for why Bitcoin uses checkpoints for DoS protection **but it isn't required for consensus**. Bitcoin core could remove checkpoints. The consequence would be users being vulnerable to DoS attacks, **but it wouldnt effect their consensus at all**.You are right that it is costly to mine Peercoin forks, well as costly as corrupting Sunny is anyways.

I think it should be noted that this paper covers a "pure" PoS system, but there have been some hacks to PoS systems to make them "work" (work while being insecure). These hacks include having a central authority control the coin (peercoin, blackcoin, and a ton more), making grinding more difficult but certainly not impossible along with making buying old private keys to attack difficult through having a centralized premine that makes the currency insecure to attacks from a central authority (NXT), or even making the next block signer deterministic, which solves stake grinding by substituting the problem with a problem that is probably much bigger, colluding delegates. , this also doesn't solve the problem of people rewriting history (bitshares).

I will define an advantage as something that makes it more secure, or have more utility. It has neither.


This is more obvious that it is a scam, I agree, but you don't need a premine to pump and dump, you only have to create a currency, be an early adopter and pump.


Why not? Does the page not have a logical flow leading you to the same conclusion? Do you see a factual inaccuracy on the page?


I feel that any coin that provides utility and doesn't have a premine isn't a scam. Otherwise, it is a speculative tool that will probably be used for pump and dump.
Blackcoin is centralized by the way. The wiki page I linked has a source showing the line in black coins source code defining the central authority's public key.

It's because mining pools can't profit off of charging back purchases [as easily as they can charging back losing bets at a casino]( and because mining pools haven't implemented the allowing of doublespending (however Luke-Jr has stated Eligius would allow doublespending if it was implemented).
There may be some ways to doublespend without having to push a doublespend after the original spend, for example, one might [create a 0 fee transaction which won't be included in an block which spends inputs X, then make a .0001 satoshi transaction spending inputs X to a retailer. You receive your item from the retailer. Finally you push a transaction spending your original 0-fee transaction with fee 0.001. You have now paid for your 0 fee transaction and Eligius (or another pool you pushed to) might win the block and include your original 0 fee transaction which wasn't propagated by the network.](
Please ignore the comments claiming propagation and "having well connected nodes" makes you safe. [Your transaction doesn't need to go through the network to get to miners.](

Yes, you could put your coins into a "LTC" chain which has a scrypt PoW and 2.5minute block times. Then you could move them back to the mainchain when you felt like it.


Just to be clear, they aren't going into the current actual LTC blockchain, they are going into a blockchain in which all coins are created through the proof that they are being moved to the altchain and moved back through the destruction of them. There is no need to get them to "go along with this", you just need to copy the parameters they changed (block time and mining algorithm) to create the new chain.

Fee can't be approximated based off of what the miners are making now. Miners wont ignore transactions that don't have 1% fees and lose that money, they will try to optomize the amount of money they make in fees. This means the fees will be set why whatever the demand is and the miners will earn whatever 1mb in fees is. If there is high demand and people are outbidding each other for fees, the rewards will be high, if there isn't much demand, the fees will be low.

Bitcoin is a protocol used for making monetary transactions, of course it doesn't. A bitcoin client could have decentralized coinjoin that works along-side the protocol (the same solution darkcoin would have).


Coinjoin is trustless, and it isn't implemented yes, so it isn't decentralized. AFAIK, Bitcoin has an implemented solution that is centralized, but a decentralized solution is in the works (and that isn't an easy problem to solve). In other words, Bitcoin came out with the centralized solution, then darkcoin came out with the same solution. Darkcoin however marketed that they were working on a decentralized solution to you better than Bitcoin did.


Dark coin doesn't have decentralized coinjoins. It is a Bitcoin clone with its anonymity features advertised.

It is easy to make a wallet with Darkcoin that doesn't have coinjoin capabilities.

It isn't an advantage to give every user coinjoin capabilities because only the subset of users who want to use it, will use it. 
In other words, it is no more anonymous to have 100% of a network having coinjoin capabilities and only 20% using it, then those 20% who want to use it downloading a client for coinjoining.
Also, no, there isn't a functional decentralized coinjoin in every (or any) darkcoin wallet right now.

9 minutes isn't necessarily better or worse, you have a few variables to consider: time to first confirmation and number of reorgs. If you have faster first confirmations that's slightly better for people who want to wait 1 minute less on average to have some high probability of that transaction being permenant.
On the other hand, the odds of a confirmation being reversed are increased because the odds of another block being found in the time that one block is being relayed increases. This means that while you have a faster first confirmation, you have a weaker first confirmation.
Also, when you increase the block time you make running a thin client proportionally harder.
If you make the block time very low, for example 30 second,  consensus can become very weak and large reorgs can become common and 51% attacks may reduce to 35% or 25% attacks. There is the GHOSTS protocol which prevents 51% attacks from becoming cheaper, but you are still left with expensive thin clients and bad consensus.
I think 10 minutes is a good number since right now only 1.7% of blocks are reorged out. At 20 minutes, one can assume 0.85% of blocks will be reorged out. At 1 minute, one can assume 17% of blocks will be reorged out (and when blocks are a full mb maybe 50%). At the same time, 10 minutes is a reasonable timeframe for one to be paid in.

They shouldn't be touching consensus code. The only time consensus code is intentionally changed is for a softfork.


Its unlikely that can be done without opening up the network to attacks. Miners switched back to 0.7 so 0.7 wasn't out of consensus. If you have some mechanism that changes miners over to new rules if there is a short chain that contradicts their rules then someone with a lot of hash power can change the networks rules. I'm not sure exactly what you're proposing, but that seems like the only decentralized solution to the problem you're hilighting.
Bitcoin is a decentralized consensus. Changing the rules (like bitcoin-ruby and libbitcoin did and likely btcd has) is dangerous to consensus. In a consensus there can only be compatible rules between clients for it to be maintained, if not then consensus is broken. Having alternative clients is good for decentralization, but they can't implement their own consensus.
TL;DR: you seem to be proposing that we should reimplement consensus rules in many different clients so we can develop some mechanism to fix these broken clients, and doing this  can't be safely done.

Maybe, or maybe we'll use sidechains or treechains. I'm against increasing the maximum block size. At 1mb per hour, full nodes will already be adding over four gb to their harddrive every month. 50gb per year is a already pretty big cost for a full node which runs for free. The number of full nodes has been declining for a while. and we're at around 8k now now. 
Maybe someday we'll have have snark proofs for the UTXO and the biggest expense will be bandwidth and processing power rather than disk space.

Do you know what Bitcoin is? Bitcoin doesn't implement protocols. Bitcoin doesn't try to maintain it's market cap. Bitcoin doesn't worry about financial institutions. Bitcoin is **a protocol**. In other words, it is up to a single person to either make these trustless anonymity features (coinjoin has been made), or copy a better version, then it is up to everyone who wants to use it, to use it.


You make it sound like Darkcoin isn't based on an improvement in the protocol, but a copy that has better advertised anonymity features (and you're right).

Like I said, you cannot optomize two variables at once. 10 minute blocks have about a 1.6% organic reorg rate. That means a confirmation has pretty low odds of reversal under non-attack scenarios and SPV clients only are required to have 25mb of block headers to operate. Decreasing the block time increases the bandwidth and disk space required of SPV nodes.
In my opinion, 10 minutes is a good combination of fast, easy for SPV nodes and safe. If it was 5 minutes, it would be a bit less safe, a bit less scalable and a bit "quicker" (even though this quick confirmation is less of a confimation).

I believe if a cryptocurrency serves no purpose and has no innovation, it doesn't have a reason to exist. People don't make HTTPDoge and try to get people to use it over HTTP because it isn't an improvement.
The difference between HTTPDoge vs HTTP and Dogecoin vs Bitcoin is that you can speculate with Dogecoin.
Because dogecoin has no advantages over Bitcoin and no reason to exist (and no, a community isn't a reason to exist, a new bitcoin community could be created just as easily), it is simply a speculative tool.
As a whole it is a speculative tool, but individually the members of the community raid and pretend it is an investment guaranteed to gain value (sign one of being a scam), downvote and hide anti-dogecoin opinions on (sign two of being a scam) and lie about the functionality of dogecoin "100% anonymous transactions".

The fact that you have a solution that is valid with any set of transactions is the problem. You can determine the timeframe before the other person wins and determine whether you can doublespend in that time. A set of transactions that can be added or removed from the blockchain without any work are unconfirmed transactions.


The difference is over time, on average, you lose money by not broadcasting a PoW block, however with peercoin, you are able to determine the time needed for 2nd place to win.

That's pretty subjective. In the time period between when floating fees start and sidechains are implemented, fees could go to a few dollars or even more. Along with that, companies handling fiat can compete with minimal transaction fees. In fact, cash fees are zero (ignoring taxes, which are applicable to bitcoins too).

ASIC resistance in the short term may mean decentralization (if you ignore botnets), but it is impossible to prevent an ASIC from being manufactured. If you have a memory hard or complex algorithm, there is a higher barrier of entry into ASIC manufacturing which means one company is more likely to have an extended monopoly. Scrypt-n is especially bad for this because ASICs eventually suddenly become worthless (when n changes to a number beyond what the ASIC can handle), which puts hash power back into the hands of manufacturers.
Along with the centralization problem, slow to verify algorithms mean that it takes longer to propogate a block and there are more stales and organic reorgs. Slower consensus makes doublespending easier.

@_date: 2014-04-23 19:07:37
Some solutions:
**Mining Bitcoins**
People aren't going to p2pool because it requires being a full node and storing an 18gb blockchain. Currently is a feature in Bitcoin-Qt being developed that allows users to only store the unspent transactions in the blockchain (the UTXO), which would still require downloading all 18gb to prove the UTXO is valid, but it would only require storing the 1/2gb UTXO on your harddrive.
This can be improved even further if there is a SNARK proof of the UTXO. I have spoken to a few coredevs about this on IRC and it would require a massive amount of computational power (which would mean trustless centralization in some super computer owner, which I think is better than trusting mining pools not to be malicious) to make the proof for the UTXO, however it would allow you to download a compact proof of the UTXO that is fast to validate rather than a massive blockchain. This is not a feature that will be added in the near future, but it will make it much easier to be a full node.
Finally, the most drastic measure would be to force miners to have the UTXO through a different PoW algorithm.
Because it cost disk space and bandwidth to store the UTXO, there is an incentive to just use a mining pool, however once you are forced to have the UTXO, there is much less incentive to use a mining pool rather than P2Pool.
**Transmitting Bitcoins**
The last of these changes (SNARK proof and UTXO-required PoW) would make full nodes more common. The former would make them more common because it would require less disk space to run a full node and the latter because you would need the UTXO to mine.
**Talking About Bitcoin**
This problem may be fixable with decentralization. There are programs such as Retroshare that allow decentralized forums and messaging.
Someone also could develop a forum where there are no moderators, rather, there is a web of trust and you choose your moderators. For example, if I trust Bob, Jim and Alberts moderating I would "trust" them to moderate. If one of them banned someone or deleted a post I would be able to see that they did ban or delete a post. Everyone who "trusts" them would have that post disappear, everyone else would be unaffected. If I disagreed with one of their decisions, I would be able to remove my trust in them.
**Developing Bitcoin**
This is really a non-issue for me given the trust I have in the core-devs, however if you don't trust the core-devs to audit the other core-devs code, you can [audit their changes yourself]( or create a fund for an independent group to audit the code.
**Owning Bitcoin**
Just because bitcoins are belonging to someone who owns an address doesn't mean they still have the private key associated with that address. In the early days bitcoins had little value and some just threw away their private keys because they didn't have faith in it.
I believe the wealth disparity will sort itself out through users selling when they feel it is right.

Vbuterin suggested we should have an algorithm that makes hashing algorithms. The problem with that is someone will just make an FPGA that changes hashing algorithms each block.

It is a trivial change in the law and your comments regarding why it is difficult to regulate apply to Bitcoin as well. The difficulty of banning more cryptocurrencies isn't very high if you can successfully ban Bitcoin.

Your definition of a softforks is incorrect. What you are describing as a soft fork is just a relay policy change.
A soft fork is when the consensus rules change in a way that is compatible with old clients.
If a new client said some opcode could no longer be used, that would be a softfork. Old clients would still see every transaction without this opcode as valid, while new clients would see it as invalid. Because of this, we have to make sure no transactions with this opcode are in the blockchain (otherwise there would be a split in consensus or a disagreement about whether a block was valid). We can make sure the tallest chain doesn't have an invalid block in it with a supermajority of miners using the new client. The miners using the new client, won't put transactions breaking this new rule, of course.
The result of this is that while old clients don't recognize the change, they still use a blockchain with the rule applied and consensus isn't broken
These softforks can add features by saying a transaction using a certain opcode is only valid if it evaluates to true for old clients AND it evaluates to true using the new functionality. There are bitcoin Opcodes that do nothing. They could be given some functionality and the transaction would have to evaluate to true both when the opcode does nothing and when the opcode does something. This "something" can be sending to a sidechain and redeeming from a sidechain.

Two way pegging will likely require your scriptsig to use OP_NONE &lt;parameters&gt;. This means old clients will simply see this change as someone paying to anybody. But the new clients will see this as someone paying to the person who can provide an SPV proof that they own the coins on the sidechain.
When you use this new yet-to-be-defined opcode, you can use the block that-it-was-confirmed-in's header to show that you are the rightful owner of these sidechain coins and can make a transaction with them on the sidechain.

It isn't a matter of how much time you have, its a matter of knowing that you win the next block, therefore, you can doublespend with 100% success in the timeframe between the blocks.


This is only true if you attack in the least optimal way (by attempting to attack every block). If you attack smart, you only attack every block where it has been determined that you have won. This moves your odds of success from your % stake to 100%.

No, that is full nodes.
If 80% of miners say some block is valid and 100% of full nodes say it is invalid, then that 80% of miners will make a very tall chain of invalid blocks. These miners won't matter because only the 20% will be in consensus with the full nodes.
If 80% of miners adopted a larger block size and 0% of the full nodes did, no full nodes would accept the new large blocks and the 20% of miners would be the only ones making money.

A lot of the security and lack of doublespends in bitcoin comes from proper useage who which includes not accepting 0-conf.
Bitcoin also would probably have few coins stolen (at the moment) if I used other bad security practices such as posting my private key for a few minutes before spending I probably could get away with it, but if I continuously did that (like people might continuously accept 0-conf) people would start to try to exploit it.

Bitcoin is pretty easy to use. An average user can click an icon and see how much money they have, then copy someones address and send however much money they want to.


Paypal has frozen more than just the accounts breaking their ToS. They aren't considered a bank so they can arbitrarily freeze accounts. I assume Venmo is in the same category.


You aren't addressing the argument. Regardless of where the dollar is going or how the price of a bitcoin is represented, more dollars will be printed every year. Bitcoin may be volatile, but it is deflationary.

The sidechains have their block headers added to the mainchain. It is up to the miners to determine whether to include blocks from a scrypt sidechain in the blockchain. If they do include it, then 51%+ of the miners need to agree that the blocks are from a valid sidechain. 
In other words, a LTC altchain might not automatically work with the sidechain implementation, but making it work would be a softfork (if it wasn't already included in the sidechain softfork).

To have a functioning block chain you must somehow incentivize miners. Generally this is done by being a currency.
I think we will see most blockchain apps end up using bitcoin because it has the most secure network.
These apps will probably end up having their data stored in a merkle tree. All the apps will share a merkle tree and the root will be a single op_return transaction every block.
This way thousands of apps can utilize the bitcoin block chain for minimal cost to full nodes and minimal cost to themselves.

Extremely unlikely to succeed when you don't bet a moderate amount, sure.


Not at all. It works with any hash power, its just that the odds of you being able to make that decision I described in the last problem is proportional to your hash power. You don't risk anything by having a lower hashrate (assuming the payout is proportional to risk).


I'm not clear on what youre saying. If it is the last of the 10 blocks that determines it, it is vulnerable to the attack I described in my previous post. If a block is made before people make bets it is already known what the block is. If a miner can throw away a block that makes him lose, or even more likely to lose, there is an incentive problem.


Its the year 2025 and there is a weekly 1000 bitcoin lottery. I am quite a powerful miner on the network, with a massive 2% of the worlds hashrate. Evil Alex decides to make a deal with me. He will bet 500btc in the next 100 lotteries and I will dispose of blocks that don't make him win. Being the 2% miner I am, I predictably generate 2 out of those 100 blocks. Now since I made these two blocks, (and he happened to lose both of them) he is given two additional chances. On average he would have won 0btc half the time and 1000btc the other half of the time, matching back to his original investment of 500btc per week. however, since I threw away those two blocks, he was given two additional chances at winning 1000 those two weeks at no additional cost. Predictably, he won one of the 50% bets and earned an additional 500btc. He gave me 250 of those btc for my services and to make up for the two blocks I burned (worth about 40btc each due to fees).

The number of organic reorgs decreases as the block interval increases, therefore the optimal block time for minimizing reorgs approaches infinity. You have to consider two variables, convenience and consensus. Lowering block time weakens the consensus (since blocks can more easily be reorged out) while making the convenience higher (since the first confirmation is faster) and making the convenience lower (since the confirmation has a high probability of being reorged out and making you vulnerable to doublespend).
Saying 12 seconds is optimal is incorrect since it doesn't optomize either variable individually (it is less optimal than bitcoin in terms or reorgs) and you can't optimize two variables at once.

Storjcoin to network nodes that provide storage space and bandwidth to the network.
I am interested, but **incredibly** skeptical. Because of the nature of file transfers, it is pretty much impossible to have a proof of download. The only people that know Alice sent Bob a file are Alice, Bob and all the ISPs between them. So you're going to have to trust some set of these parties. 
Bob might not want to pay even though they were sent a requested file by Alice. They would tell the network "I never received the file".
Alice might not want to send the file, but still get paid. They would tell the network "I sent the file, but I didn't get paid".
The network cannot make this decision on it's own without invoking trust in one of the parties.

They arent using the reference client. They are using a client written in a different language. Bitcoin consensus is very complex. An unexpected database problem caused a broken consensus between the reference clients v0.7 and v0.8. This was just from using a different database and v0.8 was tested before release. writing it in ruby adds significant differences, the majority of which aren't directly visible. Coin base could eliminate these problems simply by using the reference client.
In short, that is why you shouldn't trust coinbase to not lose your coins. Trusting them to not steal them is a completely different issue.

Not really. There are so many edge cases in the fragility consensus that alt clients forking from the network are a big concern. Peter Todd has broken the consensus of the ruby client many times.
What probably should happen is altclients should run a bitcoind instance in the background and implement whatever new features they want in the foreground.
As for maintaining the status quo, the only changes coredevs can make to the network without disrupting consensus are softforks which must be approved by miners. Having more altclients won't effect the opinions of miners, lobbying against a soft fork you don't like can be done without an altclient.

Then you're out of consensus with the network and you have no idea whether someone paying you actually is paying you. You also will accept a chain that someone performed a stake grinding attack to generate. 


The checkpoints in bitcoin are so someone can't trivially give you a fake chain **while originally downloading the blockchain**. It isn't a security feature, it isn't automatic, it is only so someone can't make you download a really long fake chain and force you to store it.

Well bitcoin has about 1/100 stales. With a 2.5 minute block time, you can assume 1/25 stales. With a slower to verify hashing algorithm you will have more stales. I'm not sure how much more, but the 2.5 minute block time is probably much worse.

Sidechains: 2-way pegged blockchains that allow transactions to happen that aren't in the main blockchain. These sidechains can have different characteristics, from small things to shorter block times, or big things like turing complete scripts (like Ethereum).
Ethereum: Premined cryptocurrency in development. It will pay miners roughly based on how much processing power their transaction takes. This means the miners are getting paid for the work every full node is doing. Ignoring the premine and bad incentive structure and potential security problems with letting transactions cause nodes to run turing complete complex scripts and unnecessarily complex proof of work algorithm, it could potentially be an interesting useful sidechain if it possible to fix these issues. Also, it is called by some to be the next generation of Bitcoin, or Bitcoin 2.0.
Bitcoin 2.0: The next generation of Bitcoin. Some say it is the new set of new cryptocurrencies with features such as turing completeness (Ethereum), decentralized DNS registration (Namecoin) (this isn't really new enough to be considered part of 2.0 by most people, but I do), smart asset and stock trading (Bitshares, Mastercoin, Counterparty) and in general, just new uses for distributed consensus.

Yes, it should automatically get *your* trustrating, not just view the merchants trustratings from users you don't trust.


If it is properly implemented, it is probably the most accurate tool for representing trust. It mirrors reality, in which you trust those you have done business with and you are likely to do business with people they recommend given that you are happy with them.
However, with an auditable WoT, you can penalize those you trust for trusting too many people (to prevent one form of attack) or even penalize them for trusting those you don't trust.

Indeed it is a problem that all mixers can see this. Fortunately trust less mixers are being worked on.
As for mixers being paid by the block reward, it has economic problems such as the network security being lowered in order to pay mixers instead of those having coinjoin done paying the mixers, or better yet, it being decentralized and free. It has security issues, mostly that a mixer is being paid to do something that isn't trustlessly verifiable.

The entire reason miners don't run a full node is to save money, be it hardware, electricity, bandwidth or labor setting it up. You are conflating a pools function as a variance reducer and the role SOME pools take (not all) as block generators.
For some reason you make it sound like there are two options: pool or full node. This is incorrect, in fact you're stated the role of pools as variance reducers, but for some reason you're assuming you can't run a full node if you need your variance reduced.

At that point I would be in control of the network one week every year.

Darn, I thought you were going to explaining why they aren't safe. Instead, you are spreading the same misunderstandings usually posted here.
The reality is that:
1) Miners will automatically accept higher confirmation transactions
2) It is trivial to push a transaction directly to the miners ignoring the network. There is, in fact, a specific node you (and participating miners such as Eligus) can connect to, which relays transactions no matter what.
You don't have to


Because we aren't dealing with the Bitcoin network. And we can assume that miners will choose to get paid $1 over $0.05 any day, so we don't have to worry about whether


Merchants will need to either take payments from a trusted 3rd party that the user spends from. (i.e. I want to go shopping, so I spend to this party to prepare for instant checkout, or I use a paypal/CC like system) Or they will need to wait the ten minutes.
It may be difficult to hand craft a new tx and push it to the miners, but it can be automated in a program and put into the hands of the lay-user allowing anyone to perform this attack.
**TL;DR: The miners will take the higher fee tx and you don't need to deal with the network to get it to them, therefore, 0-conf tx are unsafe**

Those are problems that need to be addressed with Bitcoin. The case isn't "either bitcoin is secure or NXT is", both can be broken. The problems of Bitcoin are irrelevant to NXTs security.
I will give my input on selfish mining and centralization though. Selfish mining is a product of centralization, so if we can solve centralization it isn't a problem. In order for Bitcoin to succeed we will need miner decentralization. My security assumption for Bitcoin is that mining will be cheaper for individuals with electric energy who live in cold places will mine to heat their homes (making the electricity free) rather than farm mining where you have to pay for the electricity. Pool centralization can probably be fixed with well designed software. 
These are my security assumptions for Bitcoin. My argument is that NXTs security assumption is that NaS doesn't exist for NXT, which is false.

Mining empty blocks doesn't optimize for profits. Mining only high fee tx doesn't increase the price of transactions, there is plenty of demand for tx fees among the miners.
Miners can do lots of things that harm themselves, we just assume that less than 100% aren't actively trying to sabotage them. This is not the same as your assumption that we assume bitcoin miners are good guys. Miners can configure their software to make a lot of money or very little to no money and we assume miners choose to make the most money.

The block size limit being met is new territory in the field of economics. As a civilization we have never had a resource that has had more demand at a certain cost than supply. Can you imagine of something like gasoline wasn't abundant and free? We'd have to do something crazy since there is a new paradigm.
Perhaps we could go with your idea if gas started being scarce. People could act socially and preserve spending. Though, I have a ... crazy ... idea on how this can be solved. With incentives better in place. We could allow something I might call "market forces" decide the price of gas.
Though that idea is a bit crazy to and it is generally assumed here that if gas started being a scarce resource we would continue paying next to nothing for gas and wait in a massive queue that keeps getting bigger. Or as you suggested voluntarily restrict your own gasoline consumption.
If only we had a single example of how the purchasing of a scarce resource happens, anything from milk to steel to land, then perhaps it would be obvious to someone with a basic understanding of money how a society purchasing these things would work.

We have plenty of time for 1MB blocks to be created and a fee market to develop. It is better to have slightly higher transaction fees and an *option* for lower fee centralized services in the time that scalability features are being developed than to put Bitcoin at significant centralization risk.

Did you read what I just wrote? You can fake work. You can pretend you have the tallest chain until someone actually validates the block.


That because you are incredibly uninformed about Bitcoin. Bitcoin core stores stale blocks forever. It solves the problem of spam from block 1 using headers first.
Even if it didn't store the blocks, that doesn't matter. The consensus breaking comes from the race condition where one node determines that a new smaller block is the winning block and throws away the 5TB block and another finishes validating and builds off the 5TB block.
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:33:12
You are confusing a soft limit that isn't a consensus rule with a soft fork that is. There is no need for 51% of miners to recognize the 250kb soft limit. The 250kb soft limit wasn't a consensus rule. A soft limit that isn't a consensus rule doesn't solve the problem I mentioned.

That isn't how floating fees work, yet another misunderstanding of Bitcoin Cores functionality on your part. Sure, if we use some redditors design it could be catastrophic.

Oh great, you've given me another wall of text based on incorrect speculation. The timestamp rules don't forbid blocks from being too far apart. If I made a block on top of block one with a timestamp from yesterday it would be valid.

@_date: 2015-05-26 22:50:17
Miners get a certain monetary benefit from a secure network. A miner who decides to give a central authority control of their hash power loses some value because the entire network is a bit less secure. The value they lose is very small, but running a full node isnt too expensive either. If they delegate that authority to the central authority they lose the small amount of value they gain from network security and they gain the value of not having to run a full node. The mining ecosystem is in a relatively dangerous state right now indicating that for many, not running a full node and harming the network is the profitable decision.
Increasing the cost of a full node makes harming the network and making it more centralized the profitable decision for many more. Given our already dangerous mining ecosystem, it is quite risky to allow the costs of running a full node to multiply by 50.
The question isn't "can a miner afford to pay $400 for a full node device and its maintenance", rather it is " does a miner gain $400 from running a full node ovrr using a free centralized service". If they dont gain $400, they might as well give a central authority power.
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:49:27
The specification is the code, just as it would be with every language. Changing to Ruby would mean a different set of edge cases. Either way, you're going to have to make the consensus fit to the edge cases of the language you're trying to keep consensus with. Changing the language doesn't add anything, you can just use the current consensus code.
It is irresponsible to rush untested features out because of security issues... such as breaking consensus. Its not as if coredevs are against alternative implementations, just alternative implementations that may hurt bitcoin and lose people money.
Bitcoin is unique in that it is the first distributed consensus and it has millions or billions of dollars riding on it. The coredevs are right to be hostile to developers who are putting peoples money at risk.
There is a coredev, iirc, that is developing a consensus library so these altclient creators can make safe implementations. There is no reason to change the code and make a new set of edge cases when you can just use his consensus library or develop one from the current consensus code yourself.

Unfortunately Nxt is closed source, so I'm not 100% sure what's going on inside it. I can comment on how well it would work if it works the way they claim it does.


This means that if someone (re)joins the network and I feed them 721 blocks of an altchain, they can never recover and join the main net. In other words, breaking consensus is fairly easy. Restricting reorgs is not a good solution.
Rather than being able to win consecutive blocks, you can grind until you win the block 1440 from the current block. You can repeat this process until you have come across 1440 blocks the fair way and you are generating 100% of the blocks. You probably could do it faster if you set up an Nxt client that doubled a users PoS rewards (by paying them yourself) for grinding stake so you win next time.

Could you please link to them saying this? My guess is that they aren't implementing anonymity features because the people you are referring to (bitcoin coredevs) work on the reference client. The reference clients JSON RPC is used for anonymity programs (that have already been made and were proposed by coredevs and then used in DRK), but the program itself is meant to be as basic as possible and meant to be used as a *reference*.
It is incorrect to say "Bitcoin developers" (people who make programs interacting with the Bitcoin network) have no intention of implementing anonymity features. They have been and continue to work to make anonymizing programs such as coinjoiners. No need to hold my breath.

Microsoft isn't a zero sum game. They provide a product that improves lives. In 2008 there was no trustless currency so there was a reason for Bitcoin to be created. It was more than just a zero sum game, it provided innovation to the world. When namecoin was created it provided the first decentralized domain name system. It provided something to the world and it has functionality beyond being a zero sum game. When Litecoin came out it was just a suboptimal version of Bitcoin. It had no purpose other than being a zero sum game. While acting as a zero sum game, the founders and adopters deceived others into thinking it had some innovation. This is what makes it a scam.
Saying that my criteria for being a scam is someone becoming rich is pure straw man and shameful.

First of all it it doesn't matter that they require you to run a full node, it only matters that you have the option to audit your blocks in some form. If running a full node with p2pool was optional, what would matter is that users had some mechanism of variance reduction while auditing their own blocks. It doesn't matter whether p2pool forces you to run a full node, all that matters is the option is there. Second, I've already explained that p2pool requires you to run a full node by design.

It came around the time Bitcoins were being mined with GPUs and the founders advertised it as a CPU only currency (despite GPU mining it themselves).
"As you may know, Litecoin was originally designed to be a CPU coin." -coblee [source](


It is a good idea. Unfortunately a complex PoW doesn't accomplish that and in fact has a centralizing effect. If you want to read more on why this is, you can read here: 


Peercoin is controlled by a central authority. [Here is the section of peercoins code where the central authorities public key is defined](
The reason a central authority controls peercoin is because PoS has fundamental flaws that make its consensus vulnerable. Peercoin has been attacked. NXT is vulnerable to attack, but hasn't been attacked yet due to attackers not having a direct incentive yet and them releasing their source code fairly recently.

I assume that because coinjoin is an already implemented (and relatively easy to implement) technology, so copying it is trivial. If he did something non-trivial like implementing the blind signature scheme I would assume there would be some mention of it.
This is anonymous, but it is anonymous to the set of people who aren't part of your pool (and those who aren't leaked information from your pool), but a scheme using blind signatures is as anonymous as a coinjoin can be.

I classify all those under behavior broadly. If bitcoin core was written in ruby or something, it would probably be justifiable to hardfork and move everyone to a C++ consensus binary. Since it was written in C++ performance shouldn't be an issue.


Consensus systems are unique in that its not good. If you have different consensus evaluation, clients brake permenantly and undetectably. Bitcoin-ruby and libbitcoin are examples of this.


Again, web browsers aren't consensus critical. This is a silly comparison because a web browser is good enough if it renders a page the same as all other browser 99.99% of the time. A bitcoin client is broken if it validates the same as all other clients for only 99.9999999% of transactions.


This would be the size of a novel due to all the subtleties in the evaluation of a block.
Currently two implementations in two languages evaluating the same for the same input isnt practical. Time would be better spent on scientific research on how to guarantee two programs will evaluate the same for every input.

I never said they were safe, just that there were transactions not on the blockchain.


No, they will not leave, they will use their mining rigs until they're unprofitable (and possibly after that), but eventually the network will adjust and people won't buy mining rigs that will cost them money. There will probably not be a large dropoff in hashing power based on the 2012 rewards halving and the fact that the difficult is raising 2% daily right now anyways, and I'm not predicting a catastrophe. Perhaps you should look at the history of Bitcoin before questioning my understanding of it's economics.


I'm not recommending web wallet, I specifically mentioned the benefits of decentralized off-chain transaction. 
Do you have any idea how ultimate blockchain compression works? I'll explain since you clearly don't: Yes, the transactions are off the main-chain. They are on a separate blockchain, that, when un-needed can be disposed of, meaning we could have proof of millions of transactions within a single block in a trustless fashion that takes up little space.

By running a full node and submitting work to the pool with blocks you generated.
You have brought pool variance reduction into the picture, which never was really relevant.


And now you are exclusively discussing a pools role as variance reducer and forgetting the original problem.
I don't know what isn't understood. I didn't bring pools reducing variance into this, you did. You just turned my discussion about how outsourcing block creation leads to centralization into a discussion about the ability to run P2pool without a full nose.
Well here's your answer, p2pool is designed in such a way that you can't use it without a full node.it isn't like centralized pools like btcguild. Some pools will give you work and not let you create your own blocks, however some pools do give you the option to create your own blocks.
I am incredibly frustrated that you fail to understand that pools are just variance reduction tools and that using a pool is doesn't disallow you from running a full node.
Pools are completely unrelated to the problem and massive 51% pools can exist relatively safely! What's important is that the pools miners not outsource block creation to them!

I am not claiming that you can submit the block at any time, just that you know you will win the next block, meaning you know you can doublespend any tx that would be confirmed in that block with a 100% success rate.


You don't know you have won the block until the second you won it and after you won it. With PoS, you know by the previous block you have won it, so you can determine whatever tx are in it 100% of the time you are designated to win the block.

No it isn't, XT breaks consensus, you are once again pretending I said things I did not. I was very clear in my definition, I can't expect you to read a 90 page paper if you're not going to read a 300 word comment. This is a waste of my time, you are ignoring the fundamental criteria I have given and substituting it with your own straw-criteria to push your misguided agenda.

I said it's expensive for something voluntary. Im not imposing my financial limitations on others, I'm asking that the network reflect miners financial incentives to keep the network decentralized.
If you're going to make absurd strawmen and claim that I'm trying to impose my financial limitations on others then there is no need for me to respond further, you are just trolling.

I don't see how it being an original state justifies it. Bitcoins original state allowed you create millions of coins for free and steal others coins.
All these word games are silly at best. "Defork" is still a hardforks because the original fork to 1mb was a softfork.

Good explanation of the large blocksize group on @_date: 2015-08-11 19:59:08
How does lightning negate the purpose of the blockchain? The blockchain is used for trustless transacting. Lightning is for trustless transacting as well, however it has the property of being instant and scalable, but the blockchains existence is required for it to work.
Large blocks lead to centralization due to centralization being less expensive, which becomes more necessary as large block related expenses become higher.

No this is a random number

I don't see how you think a number can not be calculated. Your lack of English skills is as usual leading to you asking non-questions. You should improve your English writing skills before continuing posting.


I didnt refer to a 1kb limit you should improve you English reading comprehension skills before continuing.

We should probably go elsewhere if that starts happening. Fortunately for now we are free to discuss a hardfork and attempt to get consensus before we hardfork.

No, its actually your writing skills, but since you support XTcoin you will be supported by the echo chamber. My best assumption is that you think a "because" clause means something it doesnt. I dont see how else you could think that "because XT isnt an altcoin, altcoins dont need consensus". You may have meant " but" or however, but the problem isnt reading comprehension, its writing skills. Seriously, I broke down your logic in a falsifiable way and you just said I can't read. Pathetic.

I'm happy to respond, but if I have no f***ing idea what you're trying to convey, then the best I can do is say I don't underand, which apparently is a nasty accusation in your book.
Regarding the original point, yes, it is fair to say that if the is an emergency bugfix that is uncontroversial then its fine to have the hardfork bug fix.

What incentive is there for someone to give you more when you pay them with the 42chain when the tokens paid are only worth one btc? I think it's a bit similar to if a bank said "we only will store $100k in funds". Would you accept dollars from that bank as being worth more because your money gest some exclusive position in the bank? What likely would happen is people would just not use the bank because its rules are silly and inconvenient.

Nope, dictated numbers like 21M are fine. Perhaps you're looking for Also the number wasn't centrally dictated, it came from a mining majority.

What your showed me is a curve that is doubling every three months then drops 10% in the 3 month period following the halving, then resumes doubling at a rate approximately the same (but a bit faster due to the price increase). Do you not see how the halving effected it when you ignore the confounding variables? Do you not think a 10% DROP in hashrate is significant when all other months you're seeing 50-100% gains? It is a huge drop. I don't know how you can deny this. We're wasting each others times discussing this.

No, with the common accepted definition that has been used for the duration of Bitcoin. We do have consensus on the blocksize rule right now, that is why the networks consensus isn't being split.
This isn't some groundbreaking terminology or anything. This definition has been applied to discussion of basically every technical discussion of every softfork. This terminology relates to our actual consensus system.
Reddit seems to have adopted its own version of the word consensus that is involves many redditors being in agreement or something. Lets be clear, when talking about breaking consensus there is and always has been a very clear meaning, two full nodes permenantly disagreeing (not having consensus) on which blockchain is the tallest valid blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:58:11

I don't, that is why scalability tools need to exist. Reading the mailing list, it appears as if Gavin isn't completely sure what he is talking about and makes some weak of incorrect argument to be corrected. The debate over the merits of a size increase appears muc different when the majority of those arguing are people who have a good understanding of Bitcoin and not redditors.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:54:26


That's the whole point, are you only reading a fraction of the words ive written? Ive covered this twice now. The hashrate has lowered historically by more than a few "difficulty increments", last halving it went way down.
You're taking the result of the halving, the mining ecosystem going to equilibrium and considering only one side of the equation. You're seeing a loaf of bread for a dollar and thinking $0.70 for a half loaf is a better deal. Yeah you have to pay less to get a greater share of the global bread market share if everyone else is getting a half loaf, but you are getting less for the amount you paid.

For every problem you solve you are creating more. This leads to a weaker consensus and a greater economy of scale in mining. Also miners generally are well connected with each other.

Yes, I read the second proposal. Did you read my comment? It didn't criticize the proposal for increasing by leaps and bounds, I criticized it for using fees which are completely unreliable to measure.

This is pointless. If we can't handle changing the blocksize to 10GB naturally (which we can't) then we can't change it safely when the transaction volume is 10GB nor can we change it under the even more.idiotic second proposals conditions.

Your logic doesn't make sense, it seems you're trying to argue
"(A) XT isn't an altcoin, therefore (B) altcoin don't need consensus". 
A doesn't imply B and A implying B doesn't mean A is true.
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:00:15
The difference is a lack of backwards compatibility. Softforks have long term consensus, hardforks break consensus permenantly.
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:31:18
Ugh, why do I keep responding. Read his post, you only need to patch it to prevent problems with reorgs. This isn't consensus breaking between 0.4 and 0.11, this is consensus potentially breaking between a 0.4 that sees reorgs and 0.4 that doesn't see reorgs.
It isn't a hardfork, just consensus vulnerabilities between old clients (new clients don't even have to be part of the equation).

I really don't see what you dont understand. This isn't a cost that miners are required to take on, it must be trivial to ensure that they take on the cost, less we allow the network to become centralized. This has nothing to do with full node count, but if you ignore my arguments and assume that this is about full node count, I'm sure you could come to the wrong conclusion from an incorrect premise.
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:23:17

Theoretically the sidechains coin could be deemed more valuable, but then people would just move their coins to that chain and do arbitrage.
I EXPECT some sidechains to have more valuable coins, but I don't expect them to be more than 0.1% more valuable since they are just another form of the same token that can be arbitraged on if two chains have values that are too different.


That isn't really a sidechains since a two way peg isn't feasible at a certain point.

Read the mailing list. Blockstream just happens to hire many of the technical users. They are in support of the limit due to their technical understanding, not employment status.


You are confused. 75% isn't consensus AND it isn't measuring network participants, its measuring miner votes.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:23:07


You don't need consensus from Bitcoiners to create an altcoin. I don't see what isn't understood.


That isn't how consensus is achieved. It's ridiculous XTcoiners hear these words like "consensus" and give them their own definition to make them appear right in the context that they are usually used.


That would be a softfork. In your example everyone would need to change to your standard to use the web in order for it to be analogous.

Written by &gt;My understanding is that lightning requires relative CLTV. Are you saying that bitcoin supports relative CLTV today? That's news to me.
If not, that's an alt coin, just like XT, because it requires a change to the bitcoin protocol
It doesn't require a change to the Bitcoin protocol to exist, you seem to be making thing's up as you go. It requires miners to agree on a new set of rules as they can do at any time and have done many times. These rule sets allow for users of old clients to use the currency and trade with users of the new client. In a softfork the clients and currency are intercompatible. Your definition of an altcoin being any update client, even when they are consensus compatible is as absurd as your claim in your deleted post that lightning is too hand wavy when it has a 90 page white paper which you would benefit greatly from reading before spouting off more nonsense. It is disgusting that you will go to such great lengths to FUD the project when your level of understanding of it is "hurr its not Bitcoin cuz Bitcoin is blockchain".

They are quite unlikely to happen without an attacker or major SPV miner, or some other failure. There have been 6 block reorgs a few times.

That doesn't prove consensus. There actually are people sybiling XT nodes and planning on larger Sybil attacks to push the XT agenda.


Were these polls of redditors? A small set of the likely least inforned and least node-running users?


When Reddit FUDs companies that vote against the larger blocks, it makes sense for them to not vote.


It doesn't abide by the current consensus rules. I could write a client that says "don't accept blocks that have payments to address X" and it wouldn't abide by consensus rules. It would break consensus as soon as such a transaction was made. There is a difference between abiding by consensus rules and not abiding by them while maintaining consensus temporarily. Your claim is deceptive.
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:59:05
Honestly its probably just lack of knowledge rather that malice. It is incredibly easy for a user, even a brand new one, to see the positives in larger blocks. It doesn't take much understanding of Bitcoin to realize that larger blocks means more transactions means cheaper transactions. However, to understand why not increasing the block size is a good idea, it takes an understanding of how Bitcoin works, its validation system, what Sybil resistance is, how the mining ecosystem works, what mining incentives exist, how economies of scale work, what a mining pool does (surprisingly few people know what they do), fundamental problems solved by mining plus the blockchain, why SPV fraud proofs are difficult, how the mining ecosystem has reacted to block size increasing so far and much more.
Reddit is the lowest common denominator, combine that with a system that enforces hivemind and you've got an increase the block size circlejerk feedback loop that leads to children drawing comics making fun of the developers as the top post.

Last time we had a fork with 95% of miners voting for it, only a little over half were  validating that blocks followed the new rules. If less than half were validating with the new rules (which is likely with an 80% threshold) then the results could be a massive consensus split and big damages.

Anyone running his code will be vulnerable to fake conf attacks.

In general, I think Bitcoin terminology should be defined at least partially such that it minimizes losses, theft, deanonymizing, and other bad things. This conflict is really about what the definition of what a wallet is. If you define a wallet as a single ECDSA keypair then people using these single-ECDSA-keypair wallets are at risk of loss and deanonymizing.
The poster of the original thread, who happens to run an ECDSA-private-key generating website, said something to the effect of "Luke isn't considering private keys to be wallets because he prefers to use HD paper wallets", when in reality most don't consider a single private key to be a wallet.

I agree that the scripting system is important, however only one opcode needs to be added to bitcoin (op_xor) for the same script to work efficiently in Bitcoin (you can already have an inefficient version of what you just described).

Neither really offer much. Ethereum is basically advertising itself as a currency that can do EVERYTHING, especially things you don't need a blockchain for, while at the same time shoving unworkable and unsafe things into their consensus system including multiple consensus implementations, 8 second block times, their weekly thrown together broken PoW, etc.
@_date: 2015-03-20 21:17:00
You are totally misinterpreting that post. He doesn't suggest we should have 1 second blocks, and he recognizes that GHOST isn't a magical fix. Also GHOST isn't related to fast block times, it is equally useful with 10 minute blocks.
In short, GHOST doesn't help with converging, which is the problem with short block times, as much as it helps make 51% attacks require 51%.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:47:36
You are right that I should have said "decrease the chances", but because it shares more consensus code with bitcoin core (it isn't the full set of consensus code, just script eval), it is almost certain to decrease rather than increase risk.
At the time, there is little research into having equivalent input-output mappings between two implementations. It is a risk, certainly.

To my understanding they have many factors causing a weak consensus including multiple consensus implementations, an idiotically complex PoW (though it changes about once per week) and rediculous block times.


Maybe not sha3, but stupidly complex algorithms weaken consensus because they take longer to verify and are more difficult to build specialized hardware for.


Not a hard fork, but I agree that such failures need to be avoided. The best way to have lots of these problems is to have very complex software.
My main concern is usefulness. I don't think ethereum can do anything useful. Implementation details are a secondary concern because they can be fixed.
