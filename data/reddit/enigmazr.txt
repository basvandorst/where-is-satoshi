The regulating head, Benjamin Lawsky, intimated that they are much more concerned with preventing money laundering than stifling innovation.  That part was clear.  He presented his argument as if it was a dicotomy - "Either we find a way to *prevent* money laundering or only those who go through the arduous MSB vetting process will be allowed to participate in bitcoin." He was dissatisfied with merely catching bad apples after the fact and insisted that his role as a regulator is to prevent narco-trafficking and funding terrorism.

Great work! Thanks for your contribution. I thought the histogram was a bit awkward to interpret though. I can appreciate why you might want to plot the absolute transaction volumes; however, I found these values unhelpful when making direct comparisons between the binned data. My suggestion is to plot the proportion of unconfirmed transactions for each satoshi/byte bin. This way, higher values can be directly interpreted as potential congestion (i.e., would result in a confirmation delay). Maybe you could include proportion as a plot view option.

These types of competitions ostensibly appear beneficial to the idea generators, but the true payoff is for UBS in this case. 


UBS gets to hear all of the industry's newly developed, potentially disruptive concepts for free, and with a small fee of $300K (the total prize money awarded), they get to own the best ideas so they can remain relevant.
If I had toiled to develop disruptive technology, there is little a bank could do to persuade me to openly share my ideas, much less claim ownership over those ideas.
Coinbase recently held a similar competition. I'm a little more sympathetic towards that situation because I knew Coinbase before they were a proper bank, but the stench of exploitation is just as strong.

Banks would benefit more from buying out a miner. When banks buy out a miner, they gain partial control over the network and reduce competition by an equal amount. 
The DIY project would take years to design efficient miners (or contract a firm to do the same). Then more time with prototyping, fabrication, scaling, etc. All the while the mining difficulty is increasing. When all is said and done the DIY project would result in a smaller contribution the network's overall hashrate. 
Even with the premium, it would make more sense to buy out the miners and cultivate relationships with mining manufacturers at the same time. Also, there is less inherent financial risk with the buyout -- when you buy out a company you have a good idea of what the company is worth the day you bought it. The potential gains from the DIY project are a projection and are thus subject to at least some risk. I'd argue the risk is substantial -- at least from the bank's viewpoint.

Yes, if the customer pays with a paper wallet. This requires a wallet prepared beforehand with the precise amount to be transacted. Or alternatively, the customer can hold several small denominated wallets. For instance, if the price is .1437, the customer can hand over private keys (or encrypted keys with corresponding one-time password) for a .1 btc wallet and a .05 btc wallet. Obviously not ideal, but it'd work with proper preparation and would still be secure if the private keys were encrypted. This method assumes a lot about the aptitude of your customer-base, but from a pure problem solving standpoint, it can securely accomplish your goal. If the merchant is able to successfully sweep the addresses, then the transaction is zero-trust.

I think the argument here actually has nothing to do with trust and is completely off point. One difference between the current pull system and Bitcoin's push mechanism is that Bitcoin doesn't incorporate chargebacks. The author argues that Bitcoin requires too much trust because of the lack of built-in chargebacks. The argument is such that a consumer must trust that the merchant acknowledges payment, ships the purchase, and generally won't flake out on the consumer. Then the argument devolves into how consumers should not focus on accepting Bitcoin.


What?! 
First of all, chargebacks are for risk mitigation and have nothing to do with trust. I'm certain that not all chargeback decisions made by big credit card companies are fair. One party is likely going to feel cheated. Therefore, the presence or absence of chargebacks does not aid in overall trust but is in fact merely a risk management tool. The fact is that chargebacks are completely unrelated to trust and this kills the argumentation dead in its tracks.
Second, sure Bitcoin doesn't have built-in chargebacks but that is no reason to give up and say that it is a completely flawed system. The rational problem solver will realize that Bitcoin "chargebacks" could be implemented easily with the n-lock mechanism (and perhaps an additional mechanism that protects the merchant too). 
TL;DR: This article is mostly rubbish.

I've had a similar experience with CampBX.  I had an account for 2 months and I had no problems getting fiat in or btc out.  Then they slapped me with a 30 waiting period to get btc out.  I opened several tickets with no response at all.  My 30 days have expired and I can freely move fiat and btc again.  Honestly, the only reason I use it is because like others have mentioned, they are the only option for US traders who want to keep fiat and btc in an online account.  I look forward to the day when we can get some good competition for exchanges in the US so that these companies have an incentive to actually serve their customers.

As a libertarian, I think it is far better to avoid thinking that the government is an enemy at all cost.  Rather, I am inclined to think of government as a necessary evil.  That being said, the USG has been continually over-stepping their authority by eroding our personal freedoms (e.g., federal income tax, PATRIOT act, war on drugs).  Bitcoin provides citizens with the opportunity to take back their right to financial privacy.  
I don't think that the USG will outlaw Bitcoin.  We, as a nation, would be doing ourselves a disservice if we were to bow out of the cryptocurrency race.  As a bitcoineur, I believe it is my duty to educate the public and the government that widespread adoption of Bitcoin has the potential to stimulate commerce and the global economy.  It is my opinion that Bitcoin has already started to change the world for good (e.g.,  sean's outpost, etc.).  It would be foolish for the USG to not want to be a part of that positive change.

The speed of commerce is greatly hastened without compromising security.  ACH bank transfers, checks, money orders, and wire transfers can take several days to safely clear if being used as payment and can take even longer if the payment amount exceeds $10K.  Bitcoin transactions are instant irrespective of the payment size.  Goods can be shipped the same day they are ordered and services can begin immediately after payment.
For example, it is a common practice for manufacturers to collect 50% of the total payment for a job before they begin even a lick of work on the job.  If it takes a week for all payments besides cash to completely clear, then using bitcoin for its cash-like quality can speed production by a week.  The manufacturing firm can begin work on a custom-ordered design immediately.  Thus bitcoin acts like cash, but unlike large cash transactions that must take place in person with briefcases and perhaps armored trucks and armed guards, bitcoins can be transacted by a customer in his pajamas from the comfort of his home.

As a cognitive neuroscientist, I find the bitcoin community fascinating! I approached Bitcoin 2013 as an experiment on human behavior. I fully expected to observe an eclectic crowd, but I did not anticipate the philosophical diversity of the attendees.

I didn't quite get the moral of the parable, particularly this sentence, " By the time the technologies to use it as fuel are understood, oil is too valuable to be burnt up."  Did the parable imply that the futurist's actions ran up the price of oil thereby retarding or stalling a nascent energy industry or rather that the futurist's foresight generated capital to birth and nourish an otherwise non-existing industry?  Or is it meant to be ambiguous  -- the verdict unread?

Adoption may increase if there was an attractive product or service that could only be purchased with bitcoin effectively forcing consumers into the community.  This has already been proven but the logic was a bit different -- think SilkRoad.  On the SilkRoad, goods and services are offered that can only be redeemed with bitcoins.  Thus bitcoin serves as a prerequisite to transact on the SilkRoad.  If Tesla motors decided to exclusively accept bitcoins as payment would people stop buying Tesla's vehicles or would they spend some time learning how to acquire bitcoins so that they could drive home in an electric car?  My guess is the latter.  Not only would they own a luxury vehicle, but they could also brag that they bought it in bitcoin.  
Of course luxury cars and houses may serve as big ticket purchases that push some of the wealthy into bitcoin, but not everybody can afford to spend that kind of dough.  Thus widespread adoption will only occur once the benefits of virtual currency become salient enough to a more representation demographic -- the middle class.  So the question can be refined to what might drive the middle class to adopt bitcoin?  
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:44:22
Right, I got that.  I guess I'm projecting a bit on the current speculation of bitcoin. The story as its told is a bit of a cliffhanger.  I can see it ending two ways -- 1) blind speculation provides capital to incubate an up and coming industry or 2) blind speculation increases the barrier to entry into the space thwarting growth.  I'm thinking its likely a mix of the two -- a dynamic process where speculation drives people into the space and then out of the space over and over until it eventually plateaus and reaches equilibrium.  Current volatility would indicate the hybrid option -- serious rises follow by crashes following a general up trend.

However, from an investor standpoint, I think you're absolutely right about Crypto Financial.  They won't be issuing loans so they won't have much earning potential.  What profit they do stand to gain will be from conversion fees.  I am not a fan of that business model as the fees always start out very low to entice new customers only to rise after a few years.

A lot of people have compared the current state of Bitcion as that point of giddy excitement and anticipation felt during the early 1990's before the dot-com boom.... and bust.  With that in mind, I did some reading on our last great social experiment.  I know there are tremendous differences between what happened then with the birth of e-commerce and what is happening now with e-commerce's renaissance, but I can't help but make comparisons.  The market capitalization of the dot-com boom at its height was estimated to be $1.3 trillion.  I'm not saying that the Bitcoin market will reach that only that we can use that figure as an upper bound.  Given that it won't likely happen for a few years, and at that time there will be an estimated 15M bitcons in circulation, then each bitcoin would be worth $86K.  Again, that is an upper bound, and the comparison between the dot-com market and bitcoin market is comparing apples to oranges, but it demonstrates that if the fervor experience with the dot-com boom was replicated for bitcoins, then we are very much in the early stages of a wild ride.

I think this is a real concern for the US.  As much as we Americans like to think otherwise, the dollar is not the only currency in the world.  Sure, dollars are accepted in many other countries (e.g., Mexico, Canada, Italy, etc.) but there is little reason to expect this to continue forever. It would behoove Americans to remain diligent and think openly about our current monetary system.  It may not be broke, but can it be improved?  I think the answer is yes, and I try everyday to challenge my friends and family to think critically about a more effective solution.  Bitcoin complements our current monetary system very well and is likely here to stay -- for a while at least.  If the US (gov't &amp; citizens) don't invest (time &amp; $) in bitcoin early on, then we will fall behind as other countries are sure to see the allure of virtual currencies.

The biggest difference between GoldMoney and Amagi Metals is that GoldMoney physically protects your investment with armed guards and state of the art secure vaults (or more accurately they hire security firms to protect your assets).

My favorite "recommendation" from the article:


I think we need to keep drilling this point over and over.  From a psychologist's perspective, the fear of loss motivates stronger than the prospect of gain.

I love this concept.  You could do something very similar by embedding a key into a stereoscopic image as shown here:   Like the magic eye images of yore.

As others have mentioned, I'm pretty certain the high spread is a consequence of the lack of arbitrage.  I am aware of several bitcoin players who have been unable to arb since the Mt.Gox DHS seizure and Dwolla's subsequent disassociation from Mt.Gox.  If Mt.Gox opens trading to litecoins, arbitrage opportunities will once again open up.  Can't say for sure if that will reduce the spread, but I imagine that it will help keep the exchanges equal by at least a small measure.  This is why I favor arbitrage, because it keeps the price of bitcoin equal for all.
