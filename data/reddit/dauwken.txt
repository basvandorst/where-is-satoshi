Blockchain.info (hot wallet) combined with Trezor (big amounts cold storage) is just perfect. And unlike Coinbase, Trezor has a great after sales support worth the name: I did have some quality issues with one of the devices I bought from them, but this can happen: it's an industrial product after all, and there's always a small percentage of defects/quality problems. I was one of those unlucky buyers, but I got all the support I needed from them, and they totally turned my bad experiences into good ones, which wouldn't have been possible without their help. So if they send me a new device as promised, I'll promote them even harder than in this post.

Hi, 
What attracts my attention most of all, is the extremely expensive price to buy one BTC. Does it need to be this expensive? 
Apart from that, I support the idea, and if needed, I am willing to assist in translating into Dutch ('cause as you may know, the Netherlands are quite an important region when it comes to bitcoin adoption). But honestly speaking, there are plenty of cheaper solutions to get your bitcoins through e.g. ideal, so unless you adapt the pricing/margin of BTC purchase with credit card, I'd personally choose another channel to buy my bitcoins...

Totally agree. We are running an international trading company, based in Europe, buying in China and selling in West Africa. Totally makes sense to do a big part of the work through BTC payments, which need to be converted into USD instantly (because even 2% more or less margin is literally killing us). 
Common practice is asking for a 30% downpayment and the 70% balance payment is due against shipping documents. Totally makes sense to avoid these banking costs, and I talk about thousands of euros/dollars per year that we'd be saving. 
Especially African banks charge a lot (or pass through intermediary banks, who at their turn charge a lot). Bitcoin payment option embedded in existing software would be useful, in which one drafts invoices as we usually do. At all times, the choice should be open to settle in USD/EUR or BTC, but at least you create the awareness by doing so. I read so much about the un(der)banked in Africa and the latent demand for a solution such as BTC, but there's a LONG way to go. It would make sense to make the already established companies understand and use bitcoin (who are not unbanked, but especially the smaller companies very often need to settle their invoices making use of Western Union; very often due to government capital controls). 
First raise their attention, then facilitate the purchase of bitcoin (check coinmap.org and you'll find out that there is really NO bitcoin presence in these countries). Only when they can comfortably buy it at a reasonable price, we can talk business.  Saying is easier than implementing, and I am far from tech savvy, but looking at it from a distance, I truely believe it could make a difference.

Noticing the BitFX logo on one of the pics : just sharing this with you: I was in HK two days ago, and took the last bus from HK to Foshan, mainland China. On that bus, commercials were played in loop mode, and one of them was made by BitFX: not too long, easy-to-understand graphics, appealing... Soooo nice to have a full bus of people BTC-brainwashed on this 3,5 hour ride. Good job BitFX!

Very intelligent and inspiring post : cross-border e-commerce, fast payments for goods in bonded warehouse which need to be released quickly, no-risk in currency volatility are in my opinion crucial for the future of e-commerce and the adaptation of cryptocurrencies in particular... 
This Mr Star Xu got it completely right: the right way for OK Coin is internationalization: 'go abroad', your government will love these words. 
In order to make Aliexpress and its equivalents truly international, the main hurdles are in logistics (green logistics instead of individual air mail packages), green customs lane, international payment facilitation: all the rest is there already. If OK Coin can fill this gap, one of these payment issues has been solved. And why OK Coin? We can be as innovative as we want to be, but China is the worlds's factory, and they'll be the future brand owners too. If we want bitcoin to succeed, no-risk Chinese merchant acceptance will be decisive. These factory/business/brand owners settle their bills in CNY, so if they can get CNY payment by accepting bitcoin, reducing the credit card fees to almost zero, enlarge their customer base (because micro-payments make sense at that moment), then the moon is the limit for crypto.

Have you checked the Ballet cold storage option? Not that expensive and a great way to store and spend safely and user friendly.

If this kind of standard 'bank answer' is the best you can do, then you better don't send anything at all. I'd feel even more frightened now after reading this.

From the leading Belgian financial newspaper: the Korean NXC group acquires Bitstamp through its Belgium-based investment fund NXMH.   
Against a background of dropping prices of famous cryptocoins, there's a consolidation in crypto space. Also Bitstamp, the biggest European cryptocurrency trading platform, is now being sold.  The buyer of the platform, which was established in Slovenia but now operating in Luxemburg, is the Belgian company NXMH. This is an investment vehicle of the family behind the South-Korean technology company NXC, managing over [2.000.000.000]( (two billion) EUR in assets.  
NXMH acquires the majority of the Bitstamp shares. CEO and co-founder  Nejc Kodric keeps 10 percent, the seller Pantera  Capital Management will keep 6 percent. In 2014, Pantera invested 10 million  dollars into Bitstamp. 
The South Korean company NXC already owns the cryptocurrency trading platform Korbit. The group also has the online gaming company  Nexon in its investment portfolio. With an estimated net worth of 4.8 billion dollars, Kim Jung-ju ranks fourth on Forbes' rich list in South Korea. On the rich list of the world's wealthiest technology entrepreneurs, he ranked 51st in 2017.

Bitwa.la ?

Btcc.com has a really nice collection, suitable as gift (limited value coins) as well as collector's items (titanium half/ full bitcoins or even blocks) . They also have an Xmas series, very suitable as a gift. You pay a premium but I think it's worth it

Maybe more worth mentioning, from today's (Belgian) financial newspaper : the "phone bank" Revolut is now finally coming to Belgium and will open offices in Antwerp and Brussels. According to Revolut, already 30000 Belgians have an account with them. They want to boost this number to 100000 accounts by June 2019, and hired Steven Geclovicq (ex-Deliveroo) as country manager. This digital bank is especially known from its phone app : in a few minutes only, a customer can open an account with foreign currencies and cryptocurrencies. A mastercard credit card can be linked to the Revolut account. They first announced their move to Belgium in 2017, but that plan was delayed.

Just read in the leading financial Belgian newspaper De Tijd that also ING Bank and BNP Paribas just announced that they'll be joining R3 and that they're much interested in "the technology behind bitcoin". BNP Paribas is like the worst bank to deal with, especially in international trade: they're afraid of their own shadow (certainly after their monster fine in the States last year) , and ask justification of invoices of even 10k USD, which means that they delay about every single business transaction. And disruption should come from these guys? Yeah right! (P.S. our company is a trading co, and we even deleted our BNP Paribas bank account from our proforma invoices)

I haven't seen Blocktrail wallet in the answers. Quite new and designed by the company Blocktrail, one of the very early players in the bitcoin space. Very nicely designed and some extra features such as the possibility to request for payments by e-mail. Trezor and Electrum for larger amounts. 
Greenbits is a great wallet too, which I also use next to Blocktrail wallet. I tried Circle, Blockchain, Bitcoin Wallet before, but the best user experiences are with Greenbits and Blocktrail.

User experience with Btcc and it's perfect

Hello, sorry but I don't dare to give advice to others. I've lost money and BTC myself due to not being tech-savvy enough, so I definitely don't want to tell others what to do or not. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:46:20
fully agree.
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:38:05
agree, very user-friendly and great design. I use Blocktrail next to Greenbits, and kicked out all other wallets.

Same here, also in import / export business. Maybe worse : mainly cross-trade, meaning that we pay fees each time we transfer money to our suppliers, and generally this is TWICE per order (once for the downpayment and once for the balance payment), plus we pay for receiving the full payment from our customers, who are all in West African countries : the processing fees for these wire transfers are huge, because very often there's even an intermediary bank in NY who's collecting fees for whatever reason, which makes the total wiring cost extremely expensive. We'd like to increase their awareness by putting our public address on our invoices, but I feel it's still too early for them, especially for our key account customers, who are organized in a very traditional way.

Just tried Changetip for tipping 2 Belgian rock bands by sending a 2.2EUR beer tip, and sent them a separate email to explain the idea about getting tipped for good video's they put on Youtube. 
Music industry is complaining about fewer CD sales and "likes" or streaming don't make them earn anything, so in my opinion they have no reason not to become very interested. 
I only had one question: can they invite viewers to leave a Changetip or not? If not, I believe it would be a good idea because they reach so many viewers who probably never heard of Changetip, and won't think of Changetip until they are confronted with / invited to it.

Forgot to say thank you after collecting! Herewith... (and I am going to re-spend it tipping an African hip-hop artist in Burkina Faso, who happens to be the boyfriend of a good friend of mine). If we want bitcoin to be opened up to the unbanked, we have to start somewhere, don't we... (and no, this guy ain't unbanked but at least he can talk to his friends in Ouagadougou, who might have deeper interests or needs to use bitcoin etc etc). In short: your tip will be used intelligently!

Bitwa.la is actually only a good choice for relatively low amounts. The service fee ain't capped on - let's say 20 to 40USD, which I consider the very maximum to pay for a money transferring service (= equal to banks). But if you want to use them for wiring 15000USD, you'll pay 75USD on fees. So you're better off with your bank for amounts starting from 4000USD. For small payments like a few 100USD, I'm sure Bitwa.la is the better choice; I used them myself and they're definitely 'legit'
