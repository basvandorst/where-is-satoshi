HitBTC has some really good UI for displaying data too.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:36:24
Definitely refrigerated. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:53:08
What are you even saying?
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:10:06
I am incredibly doubtful this is the case, though i dont know enough of their firmware to argue it.
Im just going to say youre wrong, because i cannot imagine them designing the hardware in such an easily bypassable way. They are also designed to work directly with websites for this sort of use case, thats their whole "browser support" option.
So, you're wrong, im sure of it, but cant prove it. Also dont care to argue about it any further. 
Just sharing news, dont use it if you dont want.

My reason for founding FutureHax. I make my own rules, deal with it or go overseas and get your shitty cheap team...then come back to me in 6 months and ill charge you 3x the price to fix all that they fucked up.

To me, it boils down to a simple concept. 
Remove "Bitcoin" from its name, and change the logo. If the price stays solid, then congrats on launching a coin that is successful on its own merits.If the price plummets, then your coin was always worthless, and only gained traction because of your co-opting of the name, logo, AND the fucking subreddit.
They dont even have the decency to have a redirct, "We think you mean to go to As a new user, id lookup btc, and then be confused as fuck! "I can buy a bitcoin for 2k! Holy shit im in!"

First month futures - that sold around 18k LOL - are coming up due soon.
10k is a soft floor for btc, never drops below that for long. I expect 13 again my end of month at least.

Either this or someone in his IT dept was able to scoop his creds
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:20:02
11.5 as of my ticker. Nothing to see here. HODL ON
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:26:00


Tier upgrades of existing accounts will have priority above new accounts
Note: If you are applying for a Tier 4 account or need help with OTC, please indicate this in your support request
Still not allowing new accounts to get setup. I created my account with them months ago, just never got around to verifying and it doesnt look like im going to get a chance to do so anytime soon.

Not sure why NP was appended to the end there, sorry the link is 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:14:38
Not sure what you are asking.
With the exchange listed in the link, rather than sending crypto to a wallet for use on that exchange, and then having to withdraw it back into your Ledger, you can connect your Ledger and send/receive directly to it.
This is the first exchange that ive seent hat has done away with the intermediary "trading wallet" idea.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:10:04
Followed links from this post 
Looks pretty interesting! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:24:33
Actually, i missed the most recent update, just a few days ago!
Looks like he actually has his POC working and just needs to get the PR ready for the Ledger team.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:25:10
Ive heard countless stories of people losing funds with the gui wallet.
I use the monero command line client for storing like half a coin at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:34:18
That is literally my only issue, but its a big one coming from my background in open source work.
Its a fine enough altcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:25:08
They are not.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:40:56
Good for you :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:07:07
I lost a good bit of some open source projects i was working on when i was laid off without any warning. I asked if i could have access for 5 minutes just to push a few branches and they told me sure...if i didnt want my severance package. 
2 weeks of pay while i sit around on my ass at home, or a few hundred lines of code to a FOSS project. The choice was pretty clear.  
Still, if its important to me or my livelihood, i make sure i own it completely.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:52:04
Ledger even states you can use your device on an infected computer because nothing is transferred off the device.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:03:55
I don't believe they have an Android client, haven't seen any mention of that in their roadmap either. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:01:47
They finally reset my limit, got in at 11k. Cost me a bit, but oh well. 
Did waste my time doing a wire tx though to try and get in in time. 
Should have just hopped on LBTC and found a local seller.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:53:30
No, i want to replace my 24TB NAS with the blockchain.
Planning on writing a Plex Blockchain client.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:05:33
Literal LOL. Not a huff, not a chuckle, literaly LOL.
Time to replace my 24TB NAS with, and run a Plex blockchain client!
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:23:42
I dont even use the exchange, just passed on some info. 
Do whatever you want, or dont. idc. 
This is no my exchange, i dont hold stake in ledger, this has nothing to do with me. I just shared an article. Go tell RadarRely that they are fucking everything up, not some random dude on the internet sharing an article.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:37:29
Fucking Gemini hasnt reset my daily deposit since the 13th. I want the dip!
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:14:23
Ill do pretty much anything you throw money at me to do. And if i cant do it, ill find someone who can, and youll never know the difference lol.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:51:06
I only hold one LTC just for shits and giggles. Dont have an opinion there unfortunately. 
I do see the tx time and fees on bch as an advantage over btc.
i personally am not opposed to the mindset of btc as a digital store of wealth. we need something like that, along with a crypto than we can use daily in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:57:56
Your IT department likely is able to see all that you do. Sounds like an inside job.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:52:53
BISQ is another decentralized exchange ive played with.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:46:45
Are they allowing verification again? Im stick as a tier 0 or whatever so its useless for me atm.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:16:57


Im confused, its the second sentence. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:29:54
BYOM or you can kiss my ass. Idk wtf youve installed on that machine you are so graciously gifting me.
And the fact that you can take it back at any time and anything on said machine belongs to you....ya, fuck ALL of that.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:49:19
No, no more than exposing your keys when using your ledger normally.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:52:51
off chain.
for one, nobody wants every single little transaction being broadcast to the entire world.
im not opposed to using bigger blocks (aka segwit) as a stopgap, but if we want to be visa level, that cant happen on chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:30:37
Ive been eagerly waiting XMR support myself. They have the project on GH, its actively being worked on, just isnt ready yet :(
For now i keep my XMR hold low, i wont hold more than a few $100 of any coin unless i can put it in my nano. I know there are other ways to do it, but Ledger has me spoiled. Ill never deal with an managing my own wallet software again.
Do wish they had something on their roadmap for Mobile support though. being able to plug into my pixelbook is nice, but my pixel phone would be better.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:31:07
7k in november, so i doubt its going to go all the way donwn to 8.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:23:23
Are they allowing verification yet again?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:55:28
I bought originally at 7, would love to again. snagged a buncg between 10 and 11 today though, so feeling good.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:27:22
Hope this makes it everywhere. 
There's no reason I should have to have an intermediary wallet on every exchange I use. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:10:24
Shut up
