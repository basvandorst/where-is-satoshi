Or what? Seriously what is the scaremongering all about? What exactly is happening RIGHT NOW that is so dangerous?

But bankers love to get in the same room and clap at each other saying the word blockchain.

Is this a joke? Did this guy understand absolutely nothing? The only reason to why "the blockchain" is special is because of MINERS! 
Proof of ownership doesnt matter if anyone can acribe ownership proof without paying with a scarce resource (hashing).

Thank you! Exactly this one. Big list eh :)

Crazy list! Didnt know of this. Same as the above dude?

HAHA! This is actually funny, because its true

Did thunder dude close thunder network and move over to lightning?

Ethereum is a jerry fix to get to market first. It still lacks the 7 years of testing, bug patching and the extreme delicate code review from thousands of people that Bitcoin enjoys. 
The thing with sidechains, and now rootstock is that they are both based on the core Bitcoin protocol, which makes a huge difference in terms of security and reliability. 
Ethereum is from my point of view a zero-day haven waiting to happen. The reason to why it doesnt happen is because it currently has no value and is nothing but a test system that hardly anyone is using for anything but...testing. 
With rootstock, its game on for Ethereum, and all those 18 million that have been invested seem rather pathetic now that Sergio has pulled it all into sidechains/bitcoin protocol for no money. 
Lets be honest here, there is nothing that will ever surpass Bitcoins network effect. With that in mind, anything pegged to Bitcoin is bound to have some success. 
Ethereum is good as an idea, but rushed to market and promoted as the next great thing. These things that keeps getting pushed and not naturally taken by people, like Bitcoin, tend to fall from grace again. 
Edit: And lets not forget, Ethereum is taking from the marketing that Bitcoin enjoys. It still has to become separate to call itself successful. People come to Bitcoin first, Ethereum second. That shows its a subsystem in terms of adoption. It Ethereum really wants to win, it should stop looking down on Bitcoin since its pretty much relying on the same people that like Bitcoin to choose Ethereum.

Someone should tell the PROFESSOR what the price is now:

Once Lightning or Duplex Micropayment Channels work its GAME OVER for all the payment providers on the planet. We can scale to million of transactions in Bitcoin and absolutely nothing can be done to stop it.

You people must be paid or be really dumb to come with comments like this one. 
How on earth is Blockstream bad for Bitcoin and its development? They are pretty much doing most of the code the past 1 year beside Wladimir and a few other non Blockstream guys. 
And whatever group you represent - You seem to constantly downplay the importance of Lightning and the other level-2 implementations that are coming out soon. You know it right? You know its soon over, right? Yes banker, the time to join Kodak and Blockbuster is sooner than you think.

Why would we choose Ethereum? What does it actually do for us? The idea with Bitcoin is that it gives us power to hold our own money and transfer without the need for third party. 
It solves a problem, while Ethereum still needs to clarify what it actually wants to solve. 
And then there is Rootstock, which is going to be 100% open source. Why not use that and use Ethereum? Why rely on a company that needed 18 million to build something which we can copy overnight?
