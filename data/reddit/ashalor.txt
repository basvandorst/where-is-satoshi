You missed the point of his comment lol

How do you feel about ERBB? I’ve been watching for a while, still worth pennies but their plans for Nipton seem noteworthy.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:24:29
Hell yeah! Woo
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:59:30
I plan on it but ya boi needs to get on his grind. Been chilling at home instead of work now I get to sit here with my dick in my hand watching all this money I'm missing out on. But hopefully it'll tank a bit soon lol.

I don't actually know, I'm still fairly new to BTC and I personally haven't purchased my Nano yet. I'd recommend posting this as a separate post since it would be higher visibility. Otherwise we just gotta hope some one who knows what they're taking about creeps into the comments. It think Segwit is what most people and exchanges are running from context clues from some posts, but I just don't understand it all enough to say for sure.

EXACTLY dude fuckin hype.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:17:23
Damn you smoking some good stuff my man. 
Edit: Oh aw u got me.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:11:46
If you're in a position to it's as good a time as any. But we all know how strange it can be lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:08:15
I do work Amazon guarantees/requires 40hrs a week but when they overstaff they'll send you home with no impact on your personal time off and I've been taking it. Dumb calls feeling lazy.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:22:08
Dear god I hope it keeps going down for now. I need that shit cheap so I can buy in even harder.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:24:26
This is accurate for me as a newbie. I ignored it because I was under the impression a bunch of internet squares were just trading "coins" they set the price on but reading the work behind it its most definitely somewhere between a get rich quick scheme and just a practical investment for me.
Edit:Last sentence was worded weird.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:27:26
Sounds like you know a bit about shipping warehouses, that's what excites me too I don't know how many have been packed by other packers so by default we can assume there are more selling each day. Someone pointed out earlier that it could just be people already holding BTC purchasing them but I like to hope it's mostly new people like me haha.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:33:01
The concern I have is what will stop a government from stopping it before this? BTC by nature should always exist but if a government(s) ever decided to actively search down and regulate all the bitcoins before worldwide adoption it could easily distrust the market before it ever reaches its potential. Honestly I think BTC will never be a world currency but just a type of currency that can be use world wide. I don’t think it can replace fiat. Imagine convincing copper miners and their employers to use and pay people in BTC. Everyone who makes the stuff they need to buy needs to also take BTC or have an exchange ya know.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:22:47
Will do! Lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:24:03
I can't verify with images of them or anything in the warehouse, as you would imagine Amazon is no fan of photography in their sekrit Fufillment warehouses. If you can come up with a way that would satisfy you I'd be more than happy. But I'm afraid all that I could verify for you is that I'm an employee. You make a very good point though about anyone being able to come in and say xyz is selling.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:40:39
Lol thanks, late to the party.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:18:58
Oh yeah for sure, I'm hoping this is just the beginning. Only one way to find out lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:16:48
There are cameras literally everywhere and generally the job has us performing a repetitive task in under 10sec or so. As the other guy said Nano has a lot of built in safeguards against people tampering with them. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone working at Amazon who would have the time and desire to create a replica crypto wallet and swap it out. And because the orders us packers receive is pretty much random based on whatever tote happens to show up in front of us it would almost be hard to effectively send them out. I hope this eases your concerns a bit. So while it is possible some one could go to this length it would be easier for them to just make all the fake ones and sell them to Amazon. Which is some people's concern, that they'll receive a tampered Nano from the vendor, but everyone keeps saying the Nano has built in safeguards for this.

I work in the singles department of my warehouse so I've only packed ones that have been ordered individually lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:23:44
Agreed, people use Amazon all the time so I'm hoping it'll increase visibility even further. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:08:38
True true
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:21:42
We have a Voice of the Associate board in the building I'm still debating asking if any of the operations managers in the warehouse have heard any word on the company's plans for crypto. Amazon doesn't like to take chances and always watches the bottom line so it might still be a little early in the game to convince them to take that risk. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:28:06
Signs of the time if you ask me, but I'm eternally optimistic lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:00:15
Don't play 0.06 ain't enough, gonna snatch that .1 or 1 at least IMO
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:07:46
Less than a .1 but with these gains even my measly investment is growing lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:25:07
That's my thought process, I'm still debating between it and the Trezor but I'm really digging the Nano.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:34:29
Currently yes as far as me packing goes but I have packed Trezors too and don't know the actual volume for the warehouse. I believe Nano is ahead on the sales list too but Trezor is supposed to be just as good.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:06:54
Woot! :D

I was just old enough and had a nice enough computer that I could've set up mining when it started but I was out skipping school and smoking weed instead of browsing Reddit. It makes me awfully sad.

Hey thanks for responding to this dude here. Follow up question: On the wait until everything gets sorted out, does that mean put your coins in a hardware wallet or something and don't move em around till after it's been sorted? Where is the safest place to store current BTC in a "wait it out" scenario?
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:21:55
Packed two today but it was the first two I saw I'll keep watching lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:18:58
As much as I'd love to cause fuck these overlords about ten minutes after I put it in my pocket and marked it missing they'd be "watching" me out the door haha.
