Even if that's the case you're telling me that I was charged 20% transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:20:49
I have the "sent from" address if that helps?

So the lower the price of purchase (example 0.0001 btc) would be a lot higher % charge than for example a 100 BTC exchange

Just to confirm, FIAT stands for? it's RW currencies like USD, GBP etc right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:57:38
so why have i lost 20% in a single transaction
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:13:38
I'm glad I didn't go with my original idea of £500

Any news?

Thank you, thank you. How do I go about contacting blockchain? I can't find a single support outlet on their website
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:44:32
I paid over 20% fee? are you certain
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:51:00
so if someone is charged 20% per transaction, they buy 100, receive 80, then sell that 80 and receive 60 worth in return ( per transaction) how can this work for anyone? or is this specific to this website, and i should've traded somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:14:03
Are there any specific websites or wallets you can suggest for reliability and safety?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:30
i still find it hard to believe that transaction fee is &gt;20% how can anyone function with BTC whatsoever? are you CERTAIN there are no issues here?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:07:53
It was through coinify, I have sent them a message. Thank you so much for your help, i'll keep you updated if you wish
