I would like to volunteer to become a Bitcoin spokesman or communications advisor. Can you point me in the right direction? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:49:28
Its not, I saw the price falling so I wanted to sell.
I read the entire daily discussion on All I saw was people saying they were losing trust in Mt.Gox and I decided to get sell before it got bad. I started the transfer when it was $920 a BTC
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:52:56
It is not, is it safe to post that here?
@_date: 2014-09-04 06:54:17
2.1) Yes, Now what? My transaction is sitting here with a Triangle...
2.2) 1,450 bytes, paid .0002 fee
2.3) Might have been a double spend.
How do I make it accept it back?

You gotta take risks?
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:18:33
I heard BTC-E was hacked once. Would bitstamp or Coinbase be secure enough to hold on to some coins so I can cash out as soon as the price starts to srop?
I want to start swing trading. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:07:25
You guys are great!!! This would have made my urchases of Video Cards with bitcoin much easier.
Also the catching my video cards on fire cause of bitcoin. 
Bye bye Bitcoinstore.us

This is what I read, Why I reset my Blockchain! It didn't help! I will it a few more times I suppose. 
If multibit is glichy, whats a good wallet?!?! I remember choosing Multibit over Armory and the QT. I liked multibit for its simplicity. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:54:59
Sticking to it no matter the cost is a requirement for success. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:32:57
People will speak of the days where you can purchase a whole bitcoin.

8888BTC is much different from 8888mBTC.....
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:33:30
Of course 1 BTC is 1000 mBTC
"The single largest record single tip recorded was (8,888 bitcoin)"

Where should I go? I have been hashing at BTC Guild because I thought large size was important!
Considering Mt. Red........
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:38:38
She explained it perfectly. I for one vote for this to be the FAQ.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:20:21
Well, why did you have about $100 sitting out on the internet? :)
Get a wallet, secure it, Its your safe. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:27:07
They are on the forefront of technology, I embrace anyone that will act upon new ideas for our benefits :)
Betcha they would know if a DDOS attack him them then stop trading.

That is what losing 158 billion dollars looks like

I must have been confused I must have been thinking that its the one we use therefore it must be "right". 
Now it seems that the Austrian economics is building on top of Classical Economics?
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:38:57
Its about time some spoke of this! I have been watching the market for the past week and I saw it creep up from $22 and I told myself, its only going up!
Pshh ASIC Miner Crash my ass. 
Lets freak everyone out and who wants to buy a bitcoin for $32?
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:27:35
Other? I guess I tried to run kubutu on my miner. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:43:27
Apple actually allowed a bitcoin wallet finally?!
@_date: 2013-03-19 12:37:39
The mainstream adoption of bitcoin then ASIC miners, the top facilities in the world would go donating to figuring out merely Hashes instead of general computing. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:43:30
Figure your shit out, your customers are losing millions of dollars because you can't stay up. Talk to the pirate party about keeping up a website, talk to Sean Parker about keeping a P2P website online. 
Don't have the serveers? go get some damn Amazon web services to help you out. Hell, talk to google for the health of the internet and its currenccy!
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:22:23
People take their money out to spend it on the weekends! They start on Thursday nights, then buy back in on monday. 
The early birds know than an advantage to bitcoin is the market is always open, so they buy back on Sunday afternoons. 
............... Thats what my bullshit analytical self says

@_date: 2013-04-14 01:59:13
Anyone feel like this is the same problem that has been plaguing the stock market? 
THe market is rigged because of bots. Can we ban them form bitcoin? That might be too much but we have to be able to do something. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:50:43
They do not have the nexus 7 in front of them, They look like they have built up alot of dust. These probably are not mini-rigs. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 23:53:02
It shows that as Bitcoins reach their limit (thanks calculus!) more and more of the 21 million possible bitcoins are taken up. It seems like it would be the same problem that IPv4 and IPv6 is having. It will reach the limit of today's number of decibels.....
Wait, decibels go on forever........... I am severly blown away.

Phh,  I'd like to boycott the USD

I don't think you understand, at one Point John D. Rockefeller controlled 90% of the worlds Oil in 1882. Richest man to ever live valuing at $340 billion dollars and had to be stopped by the United States goverment and was forced to split up into what we have today Mobil/Exxon, Chevron, and Amoco among 30 other companies.
Idk what I'm getting at and I think im over my head now. But there needs to be an institution in place that stops this behavior. Can you imagine if Intel started making ASIC miners?

If a forex platform is made for bitcoin, all of this wouldn't matter. 
I will take TD Ameritrade's "Thinkorswim" platform anyday.

Curses, I have been at the computer too long today.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:25:40
Depends, do you have any stone? lol
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:45:43
If it was orchestrated, wouldn't people want to have a mass buy in correlation with the DDOS?
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:10:30
Get Amazon web-services full load backup! :)
