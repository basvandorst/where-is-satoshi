The amount of btc is irrelevant. Losing 90% of a bitcoin then versus now is astronomical. I understand 90% of 10k$ is the same. That's not what im saying. You understand what im saying

No, if you don't understand what im saying, then idk how i can explain it. Say hou have 30 btc in 2013 and say you have the exact same 30 btc in January 2018. Now say btc loses 90%. In 2013, a couple hundred, maybe $1000 bucks. In 2018, a fortune. Its literally completely different

There is a pretty significant difference between losing $28 dollars and losing $15,000 but i get the sentiment
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:11:07
Uhhhhh $30...i think that's the universal answer
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:45:38
True, but % is also relative. If i lose 90% of my life savings when i have $100 versus $100k...im gonna be a little upset. I think there is a huge difference. 1 btc=1 btc so losing 90% of 1 btc now is alot different from the early days

Hodlers can't afford cars so this is accurate
