How can i know if such program installed? The MacBook that I used might be infected because I was a target by a group of hackers back then. They even manage to get my iCloud password. Every time I changed the password, they still got it. Then I just abandon the MacBook and the iCloud account. 
They didn’t get the brain wallet passphrase only because I took the MacBook offline before generate the wallet.

If I’m that greedy... I’ve already tried everything. Until now, the only thing I tried is to bruteforce with all the combinations I can think of. Is it wrong for me to explore other methods by recommendations of others?

I’m not trying to prove anything here. If you’ve spare time to comment. Just post something which is helpful. After all, all I’m asking is just someone can type in useful information. Same effort like you did commenting about my act etc.

Any reference?
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:41:27
Do you have any reliable reference for that?

It ever work before? Means to anyone to recall anything that specific using hypnotist?

Anyone can advice me, how to do forensics on my MacBook?
@_date: 2019-11-30 11:35:19
I got into the media. So if attention is my intention. I think anybody already satisfied. But I’m here to seek for advice, reliable source of reference to recover the bitcoin. Please don’t be so dramatic.

I’m so frustrated my post labelled as fake. I’m only seeking for advice. Not asking for someone to send me ฿ or anything. 
Me and my friends already tried to brute force using some program and tried different version of bitaddress. 
I actually created 3 addresses using bitadrress back then. I’ve sent 1000, 1000 and 1800 to each address. Managed to get back the fund from the 2 addresses but not the third one.

I tried to bruteforce. My friend even built some script to use GPU to bruteforce. But still no result. I’m thinking the only way is to get the keystrokes at the day I created the address from the MacBook. 
Else, maybe hypnotic therapy to recall what exactly I typed in (I don’t know either this is something realistic)
@_date: 2019-11-30 11:19:34
I think there’s possibility it will work. Because I think I can remember I checked the pass phrase few time after I created the address. At lest if I can recall some part of the passphrase (I’m afraid the passphrase I wrote down and remembered is actually totally wrong),  I can key in into the dictionary to brute force.

Thank you for all the inputs. You guys motivated me to put more effort to recover the fund. Right now, my plan is to get a forensic software. I’ve contacted a software provider for that, they quoted me $5000. The dongle will be received in a week time I guess. 
In the meantime, I’m running the bruteforce script with all possible typos I can think of using 2080TI GPU. Roughly it will take 60 days to complete 8718198944000 possible combinations. 
I will keep this post updated if I managed to recover it. 
Wish me luck.

The wallet I’m going to use is off course the wallet I’ve already recovered and moved the fund. I don’t want to expose my self to unnecessary risk. I just need people to look at my problem as something serious and hoping for someone that seriously can help me. So if I signed a message with the 2 wallet that used to have 1000 btc each. Would you consider my post as real? And perhaps recommend old time bitcoiner to help?
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:28:59
If I Signed 2 Messages using my other 1 created wallet that I recovered 1000 ฿ each. Would you believe my story and get me more serious help?

It happened to me once back in 2015. Newly generated address sent out any amount I sent to that address.
