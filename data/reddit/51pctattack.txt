@_date: 2016-06-04 17:36:39
they both do
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:11:29
so a difference of less than $2 on a $2000 btc purchase. i think we are splitting hairs a bit here

The easiest way to own bitcoin is buying via Coinbase and sending to your Mycelium wallet. Memorize 12 words and you have backed up your wallet. Easy.

neither, hit the street corner and find yourself a bitcoin guy

that thing was a fucking piece of shit. didnt even get us close to the moon.

in all probability they received it immediately and it was confirmed in ~10 minutes just like every transaction. You are getting screwed, act accordingly.

Not only can they not do anything with 12, they can't even do anything with all 24 unless they are in the exact order.
Just be smart and pick a 12 word seed and memorize it in three 4-word blocks. never type it into anything but your app.

thats deep man

without the blockchain this is just public and private key cryptography.... look up the double-spend problem

fuck windows phone bro, android and ios are all you need

I was just going to say, how is this not front page? This is the bridge to adoption that we have been waiting for for YEARS.

After Dorian, I dont think many of us will ever believe anything other than movement/signature from the Genesis block.
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:42:17
you can still use a BTC wallet AND this card. they arent mutually exclusive. both have different use cases. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:50:21
fine thanks

we have this amazing universal distributed ledger thats updated every damn 10 minutes and i just dont get how txid is not the FIRST thing in these type of posts. makes me suspicious.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:56:07
it wasn't until a day or 2 after. wouldn't be surprised to see the same thing happen here. but also keep in mind that was from his bitcointalk account, not a signed message.

personally I don't really give two shits what Satoshi's intent was, and I don't understand why anyone would.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:33:15
Found the not poor person.
@_date: 2016-05-06 23:54:12
the fuck are you talking about
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:25:36
well that narrows it down to nothing... did you ever print it out? how many copies? where did you leave them? were they encrypted? why did you even post this?
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:53:33
yes Mycelium, remember 12 words, never let them touch anything but the app and paper, secure

For anyone wondering about the origin of "HODL"
@_date: 2016-05-01 21:49:03
What are we supposed to be aware of? You don't seem to be very clear on how you were compromised. I can narrow it down to things based on my questions. If you printed more than 1 copy, someone could have scanned it after finding this paper, however many years it may have taken. That is assuming they were not BIP38 encrypted. We are also assuming that you know the exact day it was stolen, which leads me to believe that you might have a transaction link, but you have not provided any. How did you find out they were stolen? Are you monitoring a watch only address or do you have this key loaded on a device? are you sure you didnt just sweep your own balance? 
So many questions.
