I hope one day Roger Ver will become irrelevant.

For the first time in a very long time i think weve found Bitcoins fair price. ~$8,500
Whats it gonna take to push it below that? Whats it gonna take to push it above? Lets find out more as time goes along. Maybe it will stick to this range for MONTHS

Its interesting to note that Cobra has been vocal in wanting to change PoW..... So he has kinda fueled the fire here
Maybe Halong Mining are well meaning people seeking to end Bitmain monopoly. And if thats the case, why is Cobra against them?
Something does not add up
Also keep in mind that Cobra has publically stated he owns BCH so he has a financial interest in Bitcoin fud now.

This guy is incredibly smart and hes great at explaining things, i should try to be more like him. Thanks for sharing.

its gonna happen. everyone is gonna make alot of money. (except for the bears.)
@_date: 2018-11-07 19:46:37
I sincerely believe they are not and this is just a way for them to get votes

It is a shame that bitpay do not wish to innovate. They have a pretty significant network and merchant support. But it seems like they are jeopardising it all.. for what excactly?
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:21:06
Well traders my try to push it around but i think it will return to $8,500
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:14:04
if you want to sell 200 BTC you dont announce it like that because then you risk not getting the best price. Of course he may not care, but chances are he does care and just want to make money, and he does that by scaring people to dump into his bids by flashing 200 BTC sell walls. Am i right?

Wat, the state has always been behind. Volvo invents seatbelt, regulators go OMG THIS IS NOW MANDATORY IN ALL VEHICLES..
And thats the game, regulators just sip coffee all day, wait for the market to invent stuff and develop the solutions and solve the problems then the regulators go, allright this is now mandatory.

They are sending mixed signals. 
By adopting Bitcoin Cash they are essentially saying Bitcoin is toast. But they still accept bitcoin. 
I mean, what is the dealio
Theres kind of a revolution going on and Bitpay is sniffing altcoins for some reason. Its probably because of the money they got from Bitmain. Probably.

Lightning network is coin agnostic, at least to the extent the coin in question has the capabilities to support it. 
However, coins who wish to follow in the tracks of bitcoin will have the same shortcomings as bitcoin, even if they advertise themselves as not having those problems. And therein lies the scammy nature of most altcoins.
There are coins with technological improvements, but they are still not in the order of magnitude needed in order to make the base layer into the kind of payment system everyone dreams about.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:27:36
the price will be $950
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:33:45
Yes? And then it bounces back because nobody wants to sell down there.
But seriously dont let me talk you out of anything. If you want to sell just do it. I dont care
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:24:44
aww did someone piss in your cereal?

Cant wait for more LN news!
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:42:38
This is a cool tool. I was wondering if you have plans to add a sort option? So we can sort channels by how much BTC they have for example. I dont know, im curious about that sort of thing :)
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:46:18
haha....... fuck
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:32:54
on-chain ai? gief
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:49:08
I think thats possible. Iirc i didnt need any funds to get a wallet on 
however that is testnet. So dont know how mainnet works.
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:32:50
If a product like the XIV can be approved i dont see how a Bitcoin ETF cannot.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:15:37
Its possible. But it seems too good to be true.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:15:26
bear carnage? I mean ask yourself how many people are willing to sell at $8k? Thats 60% below the high in December. I think people are more likely to hold than sell at these prices.
@_date: 2018-03-26 08:07:44
I agree with that. But to be honest Bitcoiners are spoiled with volatility. Look at Gold for example, it stays within the same $30 range for WEEKS and then it breaks out.. Thats probably gonna happen to BTC too at some point. It could be the $50,130-$50,180 range tho. :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:28:34
I feel like this is the wrong order.
Get the LN into the hands of the consumers first, then make the apps? Because right now nobody can really use this because the end user facing stuff is not ready
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:02:33
near term
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:30:18
Thank you BashCo
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:45:49
why was it approved?
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:00:33
No. That was Bitmain / Jihan Wu when they decided to spam blocks full of $20+ fee paying transactions last year. FUCK EM
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:45:22
People who are smart will not use these phrases in public. Not because they should be afraid, but because it doesent help their cause. You never tell your "enemy" what you are going to do. its like giving them a warning.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:21:25
People trying to get the best price they can. They buy, and sell lower.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:26:18
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:28:49
Its because lightning network is decentralized. It will never really "arrive" just consistently build out (If there is demand, which so far it looks like)
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:51:11
Those guys have no idea what they are talking about. They are just putting words together that sound good to them. Totally insane.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:39:41
The terms stated during the token sale that Eth was NOT a security. (As if that works..) 
So far theyve gotten away with it tho
