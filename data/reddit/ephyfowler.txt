Agree 100%
I frequently have discussions with my 75 y.o. father about Bitcoin. 
He’s all for crypto, but it’s still too complicated for the average person, never mind someone at his age. 
I think it’s just a matter of time, like the internet. 
It’s amazing to witness and experience so many technologies change the world in such a short time span.
Can’t wait for the next 100 years.

One thing I find fascinating about how Bitcoin started is that it grew organically. People who believed and understood the technology and what it stands for.

While the news being reported seems to be pretty accurate, they seem to not be telling the full story. I think it's because they don't know/understand how double spend works with Bitcoin. The ATM operators shouldn't dispense cash until at least 6 confirmations.

That’s one thing I’ve noticed in the news about Bitcoin. They only ever talk about the price

Right now I’m starting my savings in bitcoin.

I trust bitcoin enough that I’ll still have my money safe and secure. 
It’s also nice to check everyday that my savings actually are increasing in value.

Education is something that needs to be improved. 
There’s a lot of misinformation about Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin, for me, is a way out of the traditional financial system.
Sure Bitcoin isn’t perfect, but neither is the dollar or the traditional banking system. 
I can send Bitcoin any time, any day, without having to ask permission from my bank who or where I’m sending my money. 
I feel the need to use Bitcoin even more now than ever, especially after seeing what happens in countries where the banking system stops working, like Venezuela, and recently [in India](  
Sure it’s a good idea to not have just one bank account, but what were to happen if suddenly you couldn’t access any money in your bank?
I’m not going to nitpick your entire comment, but I get the vibe that you should be doing some more research and get a deeper understanding of what Bitcoin actually is.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:32:46
I’m split between wanting to talk to everyone about it and being quiet about it because I feel I’ll be a target in the future (or even right now).
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:16:33
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:12:37
BTC =\=  altcoins 
And it’s not exactly an industry. Do you consider the Dollar or the Euro an industry?
From your response, it appears to me that you have a good understanding of what is going on in the  altcoin community. I have put almost all of my efforts of studying into Bitcoin. 
Again, I feel you still have a bit to go on understanding what Bitcoin by itself is. Everyone else is trying to use Bitcoin to legitimize their own coin. 
For me, one of the greatest attractions to Bitcoin is it isn’t controlled by any nation. Other than price manipulation, which has only been effective in the short term, Bitcoin has still maintained that decentralized aspect. Other than the cost to acquire ASICS for mining, really anyone can join to start generating Bitcoin. The trade off is electricity costs.

@_date: 2018-06-12 10:50:14
I agree. 2 years is the timeframe I'm going by for when the price really takes off due to the halvening. 
I've be buying since last August and I've been telling myself I have until then to accumulate as much BTC as possible.

While I'm optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, I fear of the next recession. I think there are still lots of people in from the 2017 bull run, and the next recession will make lots of those people pull their money out of Bitcoin. 
UNLESS USD begins to lose its value or people lose faith in the dollar. 
At the same time I fear that the money in my bank suddenly losers its value, which is why I'm betting on Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:54:17
Are there advantages and/or disadvantages of having more?
When I set my node up I put $500CAD.

I didn't read this as angry at all!
It just seemed very informative. Good explanation ��
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:51:46
I think unless someone would purchase a whole Bitcoin at one time, most people who have been accumulating would probably have their coin(s) spread across a few addresses.

It’s not just about losing money, but losing access to your money. 
I have family who have had access to their funds suspended over taxes they didn’t know they owed, and were more than willing to pay. But until it was paid, couldn’t access any of their money.

I used kraken only briefly before the site crashed when I wanted to make a trade.

I feel so liberated...
I got my first full-time job back in July (I’m 22), and saw that Bitcoin was reaching new all-time highs. I had looked into Bitcoin years before (back in 2010) and actually set up a miner on my computer. I had no idea what i was doing and didn’t see the benefit of mining. Long story short, i wish i stayed in way back then.
After seeing the new all-time highs, I decided I would start saving my money...in Bitcoin. I have been dollar-cost averaging since then with a few lump sum buys. 
I have now saved more money than i have ever saved, but now i feel like my money is safer than ever.
Unless someone can get my private keys, no one can take my savings away from me.
Used my gains to buy myself a Trezor wallet. My savings are increasing in value by the week.

One time I waited a day. 
But just last night around the time of the bitcoin gold fork it wouldn’t let me buy any bitcoin. I waited about 1 hour and it worked.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:35:23
I keep looking at it long term. 
I'm buying as much as I can right now. I'm not taking the chance on waiting for it to dip lower. 
Any amount of bitcoin to me right now is cheap. 
I started buying back in August at around $5500 CAD. Right now it’s at $7200 CAD.
So I’m putting as much as I can muster up for this small dip because it might be the lowest it ever goes.

I never said I need the funds urgently. I'm just withdrawing now so that I have enough to spend freely as I need.
The problem I'm having with my withdrawal is the exact reason I am withdrawing. I want to avoid not being able to access my Bitcoin when I need it to pay my bills, or to spend whenever I want.

After reading your post I feel like I dodged a bullet. 
Recently I started converting my pay cheques to BTC right away. I don't have much money in my account anymore. 
I was selling on localbitcoins via interac and CIBC when suddenly no transactions were being accepted anymore. 
I contacted my bank and I was asked if I bank with anyone else, which I don’t, so that's what I told them. 
I was directed to the fraud department where they told me interac was investigating my account due to some fraudulent transfers to my account. 
Had I mentioned bitcoin I think they would've closed my account.

I’ve thought about buying a miner, and as a small actor in this space I thought it would make most sense to join a mining pool. But would it be better to mine as an independent or should I join a pool?
