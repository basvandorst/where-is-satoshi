One tip I'd pass on is to use the [price equation guide]( to do your own pricing instead of just using a %, and then make the ad only visible to people with high trade volumes (maybe 25+ BTC) and 100% reputation.  Because then you'll deal only with experienced, serious buyers.

I just feel like when you do the % markup, which is the most common, your price moves with everybody else's and somebody will try and beat you by 0.5% or something.  I won't tell my exact equation, but if you use an average of a few exchanges and do some rounding, I've found 11% is a markup where I can always sell when I want to.  Don't forget to multiply by 1.01 afterwards to cover the LBC fee.

Sweet!  "Made and designed in California," that's the same for two SF fintech startups as well, [Coinbase]( and [Uphold](  Maybe they could host an event with all the bitcoin-friendly businesses in town.

TL;DR: there's an arbitrage opportunity wherein you can earn a 0.92% profit margin in two days.    
Might I add, an opportunity that will soon cease to exist now that it's been told to everybody?  What's the deal with [LBC]( hasn't that been the best legitimate arbitrage opportunity for the past four years?

Both [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android]( are good for getting bitcoins anonymously and instantly.

You're lucky, I think [Circle]( [Coinbase]( and [Uphold]( all work pretty seamlessly for Sweden, and the most you'll pay is 1% over market rate.

Yes, you certainly can.  I don't know of a bank that, as policy, doesn't let you deposit into somebody else's account.  No bank will let you withdraw from somebody else's account, however ;)

This is awesome, plus from what I understand with the [Uphold integration that they did]( you can get paid easily in BTC, €, gold, USD, or a number of other currencies.  Seems like a frill for most people, for a freelancer working in a country with an unstable currency it's a big deal.

I always pay my credit card bill with bitcoin, I have to [post for somebody who uses my bank]( to make a deposit, but since I can charge 11% over market I use my card a lot more, since it's like getting a 10% discount when I use the card, plus the limits have gone up since I started using it more.

I've been casually interested in the case for bitcoin adoption in Argentina, although I don't really know anything about that country.  One thing I did notice was that, while BTC prices were basically unaffected during the devaluation, the buy/ask spread on [their local market]( got really narrow afterwards.  But wouldn't this be a positive, i.e. the costs of BTC use have gone down as the float/free exchange rate was legalized?

FYI, [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android]( are a couple of anonymous+instant options.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:48:31
What country do you live in and do you have bank accounts in any other country?  How many bitcoins (approximately) are you looking to acquire?
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:54:54
Yeah, I've heard of a lot of fraud through PayPal, the best option may be to [post your own ad on LBC]( but limit its visibility to people with &gt;25 BTC in volume and 100% reputation.  You could also respond to somebody's buy ad, but likewise make sure their reputation is impeccable, and you'll probably get a lower price this way.

I know that [Circle]( [Coinbase]( and [Uphold]( are available throughout Europe and allow you to buy as little as $1.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:19:06
I don't know about the time needed to do it oneself, I know [LocalBitcoins has a wallet]( with bitcoins from many accounts mixed together so your coins come out already tumbled.  And no charge for just using their wallet.

No age requirement, and if the seller allows ATM deposits it will probably be only at envelope-free machines.  Other details they may specify on the ad page (like [here's a random one]( that asks you to write three things on the receipt then rip it in half) but it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.  If you want, click on the seller's profile and it will tell you how long they take in terms of the mean and median release time.  I've never had a problem with this purchase method, it's the fastest, and at certain amounts, also the cheapest anonymous option.

You'll get much less, so if you clicked on the 840 USD/BTC offer and bought for them then you'd pay $15 to get $7.40 in BTC a few days from now.

Why would there be so few (two that I count) cash traders [compared to the mountain of online sellers there](  Where I live most traders do both to maximize market share and profits, is South Africa more dangerous perhaps?

The BTC market in Venezuela is very peculiar, few places actually accept it for goods/services, and although people don't trust the banks, currency, or government [bank transfer is by far]( the preferred method for trading bitcoins in the country.  Perhaps because if they weren't using banks they'd be using wheelbarrows?
