This has been going on for a while now.

I did the same thing in late 2010/early 2011. Mined what was not even a cent back then and went nope. That's worth a couple of dollars now. I also bought around $60 worth to buy some stuff and spent it with about $2 worth left over. Those $2 are worth over $30 now.

It means they paid the ~$5 to hide personal information which anyone that owns a domain can do. ICANN requires valid information, but you will start receiving spam mail if it's completely public. Doesn't mean anything, I do the same thing for my personal domains so that I don't receive letters asking me to buy some useless service for my website.

Huge thread? The official thread is 2 pages and says it's a scam on the first page.

there's a zoom button on the top right of that graph

The top chart shows how much is being moved, and the bottom chart shows how much people *want* to move. There's more to the chart but the main thing it shows is how much interest there is in buying/selling at a certain price.

your math is wrong, .4 is 2% .004 is .02%

5 was hard because the correct answer was point but it was looking for dot &gt;.&gt;

I don't know what you were expecting, it tells you up front the multiplier for that one is 1.004x. That means you have to send at least 2.5btc to get at least .01btc in winnings. There's a reason most people that play use the 50% or 48%.

Virwox does or used to. The fees are ridiculous too.

Your math is still wrong, .02% of $15000 is $3.

oclgen is probably not working because of this bug: 
samr7 stopped updating a while ago, use wyuzhe's fork:
A few people got it working on windows but for most, including me, it hangs on windows. Works fine on linux though.
You can also use this if you don't want to do it yourself:

That's actually a decent rate, you can't make tons of money off things like that fast without getting into really high risk stuff. Trading could accomplish what you're looking for but it's also risky, especially if you don't already know what you're doing.
