small steps are better than no steps

Thanks. I've traded some during the bull run in the end of 2017 (i was in desperate need of fiat), but still hodl about half of it. I truly believe in this concept and technology
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:12:17
well I first heard of it in mid-2013 and it took me about half-year to decide to buy in some coins...  
Like you know that feel 'yeah that's some cool stuff I should definitely participate in it. Tomorrow for sure'

I totally share your attitude. It's reassuring to read comments like this
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:07:46
I guess that was one of the most underestimated deals for you so far  
how many btc did you make for that acc?

that's unique artefact and good memories! You are lucky :)

tnx for detailed insight
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:46:58
come on friend, just saying that this amount of money ain't critical to be lost considering filling some curiosity gap and probably having fun during the whole process
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:56:40
Well, of course, mr. Good Guy Bot :)
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:01:50
 Would you pick btc  for 1 month/ 6 months/ 1 year/ longer perspective?
Or maybe just ignore it all due to the small sum of money I can throw in?
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:38:46
sounds reasonable, tnx
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:00:12
yeah like perfect timing
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:44:24
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:35:35
what if I can invest in both edu and btc? :) And the curiosity factor is also quite strong tbh
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:26:07
Let's turn it into a film! 
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:44:11
Yeah I agree with you
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:06:08
Source? 
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:21:11
I'd look for other options of where to find extra cash if I were you. I doubt btc will go up much in few months.

it's already there mate
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:34:20
I hope it'll be so and your money situation will be worked out
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:20:35
that's true
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:56:18
that's just exactly what I felt writing the post
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:37:55
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:13:05
why you chose to pay in btc? No offense, I'm just curious
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:12:07
Yeah unless we're not talking about some big sums of money...

It has bottomed at 3k, and now BTC is on its way to the moon. A 7% rise, as coin360 shows, suits Bitcoin
