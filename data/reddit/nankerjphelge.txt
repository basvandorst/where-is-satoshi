A job guarantee is one theoretical approach at finding that level of deficit spending automatically.
Once again, sounds like it makes sense in theory, but is completely wrong in real world practice.  Once again, you are ignoring the political and human behavioral component, which throws the theory out the window.
As for the "job guarantee", that is Keynesian hooey.  If it were that simple, the government could simply create jobs for one group of people to dig holes and another to fill them back in.  But it creates no net benefit to society, it is a zero sum game. 


And once again, you are ignoring the political and social elements to the equation which makes it a non starter.  Not to mention the long range fiscal danger associated with ramping up deficits to the levels that would be required to offset the deleveraging.  Yes, in the short term it might work, but in the long run it would create an even bigger fiscal crisis down the road.  You cannot solve a problem created by too much debt with more debt.  That's like trying to cure and alcoholic by giving him another round of shots.


No, I'm afraid it is you who doesn't understand.  The Fed has failed at causing inflation for two reasons.  One, as you already admitted, households and businesses are deleveraging faster than new money is being created, and secondly, because the transmission mechanism of getting the newly created Fed money into the economy is broken.  IOW, it's not getting out into the economy, it's being used by the banks to speculate in asset markets, or hoarded as reserves.
As for the assertion that the Fed is simply doing an asset swap, that is incorrect.  Yes, in the case of purchasing mortgage backed securities that is true, but not in the case of purchasing newly issued Treasury debt.  That is newly created money, any way you slice it.


Yup, except I won't be bothering with bonds, I'll be shorting JPY/CHF.  The difference now as opposed to then, is that the BOJ did not explicitly gear up to create inflation as they have recently announced they intend to do with massive QE operations.  In any case, when it happens you can think back to this discussion.  In the meantime, your agreement or disagreement is irrelevant.

Again, that's all good and well *in theory*.  In practice it doesn't work in the real world. You say the government could reduce the deficit or run a surplus, as if were that simple.  In the situation we find ourselves in today, that is not politically feasible, as it would require cuts or tax hikes so drastic that whoever proposed it would not survive politically.


Actually, it's absolutely true that faith is the only thing that gives fiat currency value.  If you don't believe that, just look at Weimar Germany, or Argentina, or Zimbabwe.  Once loss of faith in the currency took hold by the populace, the governments were powerless to stop it.  The fact is, *anything* only has value as long as two parties agree it does.  When one party stops believing it has value, it stops having value.  It's just that simple.


Again, the value of the dollar is *entirely* faith based.  What makes the same piece of paper issued by the government worth $10 or $100, other than the number of zeroes printed on that piece of paper?  Nothing, other than the fact that participants in the economy mutually accept that they have those respective values.  As for the idea of government being able to stop inflation "in a heartbeat" with land tax increases, why didn't Weimar Germany or Argentina or Zimbabwe just do that?  Answer is, it sounds good in abstract theory, but in real world practice it doesn't account for the human and political elements.  In other words, it works only in the vacuum of abstract academic theory, but not at all in the real world.

As a professional trader/investor I've gotten quite good at spotting bubbles, in fact it's one of my specialities.  There are a couple things that mark a clear bubble.  The first is the price chart.  Any asset which has a vertical, parabolic price move in a compressed period of time is a prime candidate for a bubble.  In fact, you can look at just about any asset which has experienced a bubble, and the parabolic chart action looks almost identical.  Bitcoin's price chart was exactly the same.
The second component is mass psychology.  During a bubble, investors and evangelists for the asset that is in the bubble will proclaim ever higher and more preposterous valuations as it reaches its bubble climax.  Bitcoin once again filled that perfectly, as once it hit $1000, people were falling over each other to proclaim when it would go to $10,000, or $20,000, and I believe I heard someone recently say $40,000.  Just like during the 90's stock bubble people proclaimed WHEN, not IF the Dow would hit 20,000 or 40,000.  And when oil was in a bubble in 2008, WHEN, not IF oil would hit $200/bbl.  Or when silver was in a bubble, WHEN, not IF it would hit $100/oz.  
All of which presaged dramatic collapses soon thereafter.  Classic bubble psychology.  
In addition, there was the usual chorus of "this time is different".  As a trader, that phrase is **always** music to my ears, because it seals the deal that the bubble mentality has taken firm hold.  Evangelists will trot out every rationalization and explanation in the world to explain why absurd valuations are completely justified, or why it's not a bubble, and why the bubble asset is "different" from anything previously, and that's why it is worth its absurd valuation.  And of course, this time is never different.
And then there is the media and public sentiment.  Once the mainstream (non-financial) media grabs a hold of a financial story and it makes the front pages and ordinary non-financial people start talking about it or wanting to get in on the frenzy, you know it's a bubble.  I knew the Bitcoin bubble was ready to pop when I was reading about it on the front pages of USA Today and Newsweek, and my buddy who knows nothing about investing asked me if he should start buying Bitcoin.  Classic bubble behavior.
And finally, any asset which collapses and loses 50% of its value overnight, **no matter what the catalyst**, is confirmation it was in a bubble.  Only assets that are priced at bubble valuations are at risk of such dramatic collapses.  Ones that are not bubbles may suffer varying degrees of declines on "bad news", but not 50% collapses overnight.
It sounds like you're still trying to convince yourself that Bitcoin wasn't in a bubble, but I can assure you it was.  Every single check mark that you would use to identify a bubble was present here.  This time was not different.  Again, this has nothing to do with whether it will still be viable as a currency or investment over time, but there is no question that its price behavior was a bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:46:36
NO.  A bubble is not defined by how long its price remains depressed after bursting.  A bubble is defined by the price action during its rise, the psychology of its participants, and the severity of degree of collapse.  How long the collapse lasts is irrelevant to the fact of it having been a bubble and collapsed to begin with, which Bitcoin has already done all of those things.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:12:12
Every bubble looks the same, no matter what asset it is.  It goes up and up, and people proclaim ever higher and more absurd predictions of valuations to the moon, and become convinced that the irrational is completely rational.  Then it crashes and people are ruined.
People think the financial markets are about money.  They're not.  They're about human psychology.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:19:55
Well, I certainly wish you luck with your holdings.  All the best.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:49:35
I would suggest you do more study on the history of bubbles and what they look like, and the characteristics that accompany them.  As a professional investor and trader I am very well versed in bubble behavior in financial assets and markets.  And Bitcoin fit every single characteristic, including the types of fundamental rationalizations investors invariably would try to put forth to deny the existence of a bubble, such as you put forth above.  Lots of investors made lots of well thought out rationalizations as to why stocks weren't a bubble in 1999, or housing wasn't a bubble in 2005/2006, or oil wasn't a bubble in 2008, and on and on.  But of course that didn't change the fact that they were in bubbles.  This time was not different.
 &gt;Take a look at the historical standard deviation of bitcoin prices and tell me how the recent returns fit into that distribution. I haven't ran this calculation, but if its less than 3 standard deviations, there is no way it can be called a bubble.
I would suggest you look at a chart of Bitcoin:
You see that vertical parabolic move from October to December?  That's a 1200% move in 2 months.  Classic bubble price chart move.  In fact, as I told another poster here, every single bubble when charted looks the same, with the same type of ending vertical price move.  This time was not different.
And a bubble is marked not just by a vertical sudden price move and subsequent collapse (such as Bitcoin's recent 50% collapse in 1 day), but also by the mass investor psychology that accompanies every bubble.  Which again, was present in Bitcoin just as it was in all previous types of bubbles.  
Bad news does not cause an asset to collapse by 50% overnight, unless that asset was in a bubble.  In 2008, stocks didn't collapse because of Lehman Bros', they collapsed because of the housing bubble, Lehman Bros. was just one of any number of catalysts that could have been the trigger.  Likewise, Bitcoin didn't collapse 50% because of "bad news from China", it collapsed because it was a bubble, and the China news was just one of any number of catalysts that could have been the trigger.
If you wish to continue to rationalize why Bitcoin wasn't a bubble and "this time is different", feel free.  But every characteristic that makes a bubble was fit to a T by Bitcoin--the parabolic price move, the investor denial and ever more absurd price predictions ($10,000!  $20,000!  $40,000!), the rationalizations, and finally the collapse.  This time was not different.

Well, velocity of money is very real, and it is a fact that when it is falling and money circulation slows in the economy, new money creation will not be inherently inflationary.  Fractional reserve banking is also very real, so I'm not sure how money multiplier can be considered a theory, since it's pretty plain to see in real world action.


This doesn't track with reality.  In real world practice, with interest rates being as low as they are today, customer demand for loans is up.  The problem is that banks are not lending to them, partially because of tighter lending standards and restrictions, but also because it is lower risk for banks to take the money they have on hand and plow it into risk asset markets than to loan it out to customers.  This is borne out by the number of people who wish to get loans but are being turned down by lenders, including credit worthy borrowers.  It is also borne out by the distortions currently being observed in various equity and commodity futures markets.

Then you haven't studied the markets nor their history very well.  What do you think drives asset prices and what you call "structural" movements??  Human psychology and behavior.  The reason markets are cyclical is **because** human psychology and emotion is repeatable and predictable.  As a professional trader and investor, I'm not surprised to see responses like yours, sadly they're all too common, and they betray a lack of understanding of what drives markets.  Which is why I suppose a majority of investors lose money and buy high and sell low.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:42:28
*sigh* You're talking apples and I'm talking oranges.  I'm not trying to tell you what the future holds for Bitcoin, or its viability from a fundamental standpoint into the future.  I'm telling you that it's **price action** this year and the behavior of participants **during** that price move was a bubble.  It doesn't mean anything about its future or its prospects from here on out.  I don't understand why you're not getting that my pointing out it was in a bubble and that the bubble burst has NOTHING to do with its long term fundamentals or long term prospects, anymore than oil or silver or stocks or housing bubbles that burst didn't have anything to do with their long term fundamentals or prospects!!

And where does the money come from to pay those workers digging holes?  Government debt, which is to say the taxpayers, either current or future.  So you are either simply taking from Paul to pay Peter, or you are pulling forward demand from the future in the form of future tax revenues.  Again, it is a zero sum game.


Again, you keep missing where does the money come from to pay those homeless people wages?  It comes from either current or future taxpayers.  So yes, in the case of what you are describing, it is indeed a zero sum game.


Are you kidding me?  You are assuming that the amount of money that can be lent to a government is infinite??  The only way that is possible is through endless printing of money, which eventually leads to massive inflation and skyrocketing interest rates in the markets, which of course leads to a currency and bond market collapse.


Yes, the Fed is indeed increasing financial assets.  When the government issues new debt, and the Fed is the purchaser of that debt, new financial assets have been created.  Talk about econ 101!




I mean really, please explain to me the difference in no unclear terms. Why do you believe that printing bonds - pieces of paper that trade for pretty much their face value - to be not overly inflationary, but printing cash - pieces of paper that trade for exactly their face value - extremely inflationary? What's the difference?
As I've already explained to you, neither one is necessarily *immediately* inflationary, depending on the *transmission mechanism* and the velocity of money.  Again, see the analogy of Ted and the money buried in the hole in the ground.  In the case of the Fed right now, they are pushing on a string, because the transmission mechanism is currently broken, i.e. banks not lending and borrowers unable or unwilling to borrow.  And further to the point, you have misunderstood me to begin with.  Debt issuance and monetization of that debt currently are going hand in hand.  If new government debt issuance was being purchased using existing dollars by foreign or domestic investors, then no, it is not inherently inflationary.  However, if new government debt issuance is being purchased by a central bank which is creating new Dollars to purchase that debt, then yes, it does indeed have the potential to be inflationary.


With all due respect, I am a professional trader/investor.  That is what I have successfully done for the past 15 years.  It is clear from our discussion that you do not trade or participate in the markets in any meaningful way.  What you are demonstrating with your thought process is what is known as recency bias, that is to say you are projecting previous or current conditions into the indefinite future.  Which is always a mistake, particularly when we are in an era of stagnation, such as we currently are.
That the "short Japan" trade has not been successful for others for the past decade does not mean it will not ever come to fruition.  As with all things for those who understand how to trade the markets, it is a matter of timing and following reliable indicators to know *when* to enter a given trade.  So thanks for the advice, but when the time comes for me to pull the trigger, don't worry about me.  I'll be fine.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:17:01
Just as a point of clarification, the Fed's QE has the potential to be highly inflationary, but it has not resulted in real inflation *yet* due to the velocity of money remaining stagnant.  New money is being created by the Fed, but it is not making its way out into the real economy, by virtue of banks who are the recipients of that new money not lending it out, but rather hoarding it or using it to speculate in the financial markets.  
An analogy would be if I print up a million dollars of new money and give it Ted, but rather than spend it Ted buries it in a hole in his back yard, it has no effect upon the economy.  I may have increased the money supply, but because the transmission mechanism (Ted spending or utilizing the money in the general economy), is broken, and therefore the velocity of money has decreased.
Now, if Ted one day decides to dig up that money and start spending it, it can be inflationary, since that money will now be entering circulation in the economy.  
So the danger with what the Fed is doing with its unprecedented QE operations is that at a certain point if and when banks do start lending out all that money and velocity of money starts to increase, we could see a rapid inflationary conflagration.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:26:43
I'm not arguing against the long term viability of Bitcoin, or whether it has a bright future or not.  Simply pointing out that its price behavior this year was a classic bubble, nothing more nothing less.  Stocks, housing and silver all experienced bubbles over the past decade, but it didn't invalidate them as asset classes, it just means they had unsustainable pricing behavior and mass psychology for a time.  And that is what happened to Bitcoin this year.  That's all.

If what you are describing were true, then all a government would have to do is borrow their way to prosperity on an infinite scale, and voila, there would never be another recession again!  Of course, we know it doesn't work that way.  You cannot borrow your way to prosperity, because the part you are missing is *debt service*.  At a certain point, if you keep piling debt upon debt upon debt, the debt service portion of the government's budget grows larger and larger, until it begins to eat up the budget.  This is precisely what is just beginning to happen now with Japan, as their debt service has eclipsed their social security payments, and is now the single largest budget expenditure in their budget.  Guess what happens if they continue piling on the debt, and/or God forbid interest rates start shooting up?  There is no free lunch here.  You cannot borrow your way to prosperity.


It's government deficits that add to our savings - not asset swaps. Irrespective of if the Fed does QE or not, deficits add to our savings. A $1bn deficit always adds $1bn worth of net financial assets, and it matters not whether they are in the form of bonds or in cash - our buying power, our ability to bid up prices - is increased by $1bn.
The Fed swapping $1bn worth of bonds with $1bn in cash is not increasing our NFA. It's merely changing their makeup.
This is incorrect.  When the government creates new Treasury debt, there are only two options for it to be purchased.  One, is for it to be purchased using *existing* Dollars by foreign or domestic investors, in which case yes, there is no increase in net financial assets, it is a straight swap of one existing asset for another.  The second option, which is what is happening on a large scale today, is for the Fed to monetize that new debt by creating *new* dollars to purchase it, and in doing so it is indeed creating new financial assets in the form of new Dollars.  It's just that simple.  


No.  What you are describing would cause limited price inflation in specific areas, but if the debt itself is purchased using existing Dollars then it is not truly inflationary, since inflation is an increase in the money supply, and the money supply is not being increased in this case.  What you are describing is similar to what is happening right now in equity and commodity futures markets, where the money the Fed is creating to purchase debt is being funneled into risk asset markets, thereby pushing them higher and creating asset specific price inflation.  However, it is not truly inflationary yet, because its effect, much like the hypothetical effect in your steel example, is limited to a narrow range of assets.  During a true inflation, ALL prices and wages rise, not just a targeted handful.


Again, see above.

You don't seem to understand.  It's **already** satisfied every condition of a bubble.  What it does from here doesn't change that one bit.  After stocks collapsed in 2000, they eventually came back up a few years later.  Did that mean they weren't in a bubble before their first collapse?  Nope.  
Oil collapsed from $140/bbl down to $30/bbl, now it's back up to $100/bbl.  Does that mean when it was at $140 and then it had a collapse that it wasn't a bubble?  Nope.
Whether Bitcoin eventually makes its way back up or not from here doesn't change the fact that it already WAS in a bubble.  The future doesn't change the facts of the past.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:21:13
And I've spent my life trading, studying and analyzing financial markets, market psychology and price action.  You don't realize it, but you're attempting to engage in the very types of rationalizations I just talked about.  What does "utility value" have to do with bubble price action??  Nothing.  No different than people who argued that "they don't make any more land" to rationalize houses selling at 20x rental yields and income, or internet stocks without earnings selling for $600 a share because of "new metrics", or peak oil theories to rationalize oil moving vertically to $140/bbl.  A bubble is a bubble is a bubble, it doesn't matter the asset class, or the market, or what "utility" or value you can argue it has.  Housing has utility value, does it not?  Did that stop it from being in a bubble?  Nope.  Oil has utility value, does it not?  Did that stop it from being in a bubble?  Nope.  
You are of course free to continue to make rationalizations for why it wasn't in a bubble, but it doesn't matter.  The price action has already told the story.  
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:28:05


And therein lies the rub.  As you pointed out, the Fed has run out of tools, yet the economy remains severely impaired.  Yes, true inflation remains subdued.  The problem isn't right now, the problem is what happens when inflation *does* take off, and the in the interim government spending and debt levels have continued to go parabolic, and a rise in interest rates will prove catastrophic.  
Even now we are in a form of stagflation, where wages remain stagnant, yet prices of food, energy, healthcare and other basic staples that make up the budgets of most Americans continue spiraling ever higher.  Given the extreme nature of the economic situation, traditional policy responses will not work.


To answer your question, again, just look at previous episodes of hyperinflations.  Why did not higher taxes simply solve the problem when hyperinflation broke out in other examples in history?  The answer is that faith in the currency had already been destroyed, and the velocity of money had gotten too great.  So if the government told me I owed $10,000 to keep my house, but $10,000 doesn't buy me more than a set of dishes at Wal Mart, I'd say fine, here's your worthless $10,000.  The part you keep missing is the psychological and human nature part that takes hold both during hyperinflations and deflations.


Well, by your own logic, shouldn't those countries have simply reduced their deficits or run surpluses to stop their hyperinflations?  Wasn't it just that simple?  Why didn't they do what you suggest is so easy to do to stop inflation?


With all due respect, everything you keep arguing is from the POV of academic theory and not real world historical outcomes or practice.  Yes, *in theory* a government could remove money from the economy by raising taxes, or cutting the deficit, or what have you.  But it cannot be considered in a vacuum without also looking at the current economic conditions, as well as the political and human ramifications.  If it were that easy, why didn't Weimar, or Argentina or Zimbabwe simply cut their "massive" deficits?  Why didn't they just jack taxes to the moon if it's just that easy?  The answer again, is that you are missing the political and human behavioral elements to the equation.

How exactly do higher deficits solve employment?  We have higher deficits now than ever before, while at the same time the labor force participation rate is at a 35 year low.  Exactly how high do deficits have to be then for your theory to hold water?


Yes, as long as deflationary forces persist, inflation will not prevail.  But at a certain point when those deflationary forces begin to ebb, and the central bank and government has been attempting to inflate against it all that time, the flow will rapidly reverse and flip into runaway inflation.  In fact, I am on record predicting that Japan will in fact be the first country to flip into hyperinflation sometime before the end of this decade, and that will be the harbinger of what will happen to us if we continue following in their footsteps.  Mark it down, you heard it here first.

Bubble participants will always find rationalizations to explain away bubble behavior.  If "bad news" can make an asset class collapse by 50% in a day, then that asset class was in a bubble.  The USD for example has experienced plenty of "bad news" events over the decades, and never once experienced a movement like BTC has.  Because the USD was never in a bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:05:27
Firstly, because Bitcoin evangelists wish to claim it is a viable currency replacement for other currencies.  As long as it behaves with the kind of volatility that it has shown, it cannot be one.  Secondly, and most importantly, price movements are price movements, period.  Same with mass human psychology that accompanies said price movements.
I can provide any number of other comparisons across numerous asset classes, the USD was but one example of what an asset class that has never experienced a bubble would look like in comparison to one that has (Bitcoin).  The fact is that throughout history, every asset that has experienced the type of price movements and mass psychology that we have seen with Bitcoin this year, whether it was Tulip mania, or the Dutch East India bubble, or the NASDAQ bubble, or the housing bubble, or the silver bubble, they all look the same, and they all end the same.
As John Marks Templeton famously said, "The four most expensive words in the English language are:  This time is different."
Now, none of this is to say that Bitcoin can't survive and eventually mature into a stable currency, that is entirely possible and remains to be seen.  The point is simply that **right now** it has experienced a bubble, and that bubble is bursting, and its bubble behavior and the fallout is no different than any other asset class bubble that has ever been.  This time is not different.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:54:35
Under normal circumstances you would be correct that the Fed could "simply" raise interest rates to curb inflation.  However, we are not in normal circumstances anymore.  The Fed has undertaken unprecedented monetary policy on a scale that has never been done before, and in the process has painted itself into a corner.  
Even if inflation starts to become a problem now, the Fed cannot easily raise rates without crashing the economy, because the entire economy has become dependent upon cheap money and near zero interest rates. Bernanke himself has admitted to targeting stocks and risk assets with his QE policies, in an attempt to create a so-called "wealth effect", and in the process has created yet another stock market bubble, as well as bubbles in high yield junk bonds.  Government borrowing has exploded the past 5 years, and has remained manageable only because interest rates are cheap.  If the Fed were to raise interest rates in an inflationary episode, money would go rushing out of those places, crashing stocks and bonds, not unlike what the raising of interest rates did to pop the previous tech stock (99-00) and housing (06-07) bubbles, and we know how that turned out.  Higher interest rates on Treasuries would also cause the debt service portion of the Federal budget to rapidly climb, creating a negative feedback loop.  The Fed is now effectively boxed in, they are damned if they do and damned if they don't.
Also recall that in hyperinflationary episodes in history in other countries, the central bank or government did attempt to raise interest rates to combat it to no avail, because hyperinflation is not just monetary based, it is also psychological in terms of the populace.  Given the fact that the only thing that gives a fiat currency value is trust and confidence by those who use it, when that trust and confidence fails, no amount of interest rate hikes will help, the currency becomes a game of "hot potato", in that it is a race to see who can get spend and get rid of it the fastest.

Yes it is.  I am starting to suspect you are either an academic economist or an econ student, given that you are speaking exclusively in theoretical terms and completely disregarding the political, socio-economic and human elements involved.


It's absolutely true, to disregard this basic fundamental reality is to be ignorant, sorry.  Have not wages remained stagnant?  They have.  This is indisputable fact.  Have not energy and food prices risen precipitously over the past few years?  They have.  Have not healthcare and tuition costs also risen precipitously?  They have.  None of these facts are disputable, they are plain as day.  So again, a situation where wages have stagnated, while all the basic costs that account for the majority of the average household budget have gone up strongly is self evident.  To deny this is to deny reality.


In theory yes.  In reality it is not practicable.  As for where all the money comes from, it comes from the new money being created by the Fed making its way into the real economy too quickly, at which point the genie will be out of the bottle, and the Fed and government will be, as always, behind the curve.


And why do you think that is?  Here is where you keep missing the plot.  The reason governments don't do that is because of the political and human element you continue to ignore in "hypothetical land".  Those deficits you claim are so easy to reduce represent money that various constituencies have gotten accustomed to receiving from the government--money that they would be very unhappy to stop receiving.  It's the same story everywhere.  Citizens always think it's a good idea for government to get its spending under control and cut spending--except when it comes time to actually cut the spending that *they* benefit from.  And all that deficit spending?  Someone in the economy is benefiting from all of it in one form or another, and that is why it becomes politically unfeasible to cut deficits as simply as you seem to imagine it can be done.
So yes, in a perfect theoretical world, it would be just that easy.  When you're a politician or bureaucrat whose job is on the line if you do it, it's a whole other ball of wax.


You mean just like the Fed lifted rates in the late '90s when it decided spending needed to be reduced, thereby crashing the stock market?  And then cut rates after the crash in response, thereby fostering the housing bubble?  And then raised rates again in response to the inflationary bubble, helping to burst it and cause the next crash?  And then cut rates to near 0, now fostering yet another stock bubble as well as a junk bond bubble?  The fact is, the Fed and government have proven time and again that not only have they been consistently behind the curve every time, but they have been primarily responsible for the bubble/bust cycles we are now being subjected to.


Sounds great in theory.  Would be a mess in real world practice.  There are already government bodies that set land value taxes, they are called county property appraisers.  And if there were a national body that set blanket tax rates for all land, it would cause all sorts of distortions, given the disparities in various real estate markets around the country, and the various needs and effects of RE taxes on various entities and jurisdictions.  My brother-in-law works for a property tax adjustment company, so I see first hand how a one size fits all approach would be a disaster.
