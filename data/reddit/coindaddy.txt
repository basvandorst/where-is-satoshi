Are you in the US or Canada? How do you want to pay for them?

When I called in a few weeks ago to check it out to inquire about $2000-$3000 CAD in btc I was told I had to put an order in, that they didn't have coins on hand so I found locally instead.

I live in Toronto and can meet you face to face and sell you all the coins you want whenever :) bitcoincarver give me a shout.

What kind of price are you looking for? I can pretty easily source large quantities of coin and have no problem using escrow services so you can make sure you get the coins you pay for. msg me.

I'm in Toronto and have been thinking the same thing. I have contacts in New York, Tokyo, and HK in Forex trading and they're providing me with a more established opinion, advice, as well as investment. If you'd like to meet and chat about it let me know. I'm downtown King and Bathurst.

I really don't get how the same article over and over in different magazines is news. People really have no clue about Bitcoin at all. Makes me sad :/

You have to choose what's most important; cost or convenience. If your willing to wait as long as it takes to get the best possible price then the established channels are the way to go. If you need a lot of coins and fast there are a few escrow services like btcrow.com that can secure the exchange for you to pay any individual user with the means a premium to provide you the service you require. Like 5-10% over market value. I could do so but it sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it too ;)

cool, I'll give you a shout. Theres a Bitcoin meetup tmrw at 4:30 at Bathurst and Bloor apparently if your interested in coming :) I'm gonna check it out.

I would agree with you but only if I only used bitcoins and no other currency, I can no longer afford to become a member and I'm sure many others are in the same boat.

I'm confused how having the accounts being in the US as opposed to Japan affects Canadians ANY differently seeing as that's still an international wire transfer for us? We'll incur the exact same fees. How is it ANY different for Canucks?? They keep saying USA/Canada but why is it being clumped together???

the price if Bitcoins doubled since the foundation site went up. The price to become a member has remained at 25 Bitcoins. Now it's literally twice as expensive to donate :( Wish they had that number as part of a rolling scale related to the MtGox value of btc. If not then I expect their registration/donation numbers will fall. I wanted to donate and still want to but not if it's close to $700 :((

I really hope no one is naive enough to use that website :( any Tor service would only be available using the Tor browser to begin with. That fact alone makes this a scam. Hope no one throws their actual hard earned money away.

they robably invested $20,000+ month ago in order to achieve that. there's the payoff for his/her risk taking.

This is what I meant by sharing of information. I don't think it hurts to talk about whats potentially out there if we're all just waiting for the exact same thing, actionable information to lower investment risk. Guaranteed its something we can all hedge on together to make it real for everyone or even a small group. Lets exchange info.

email me direct and we can pick it up from there: bitcoincarver
I honestly think there is something to be said for a less regulated higher fee, convenience based, private market for Bitcoin exchange. Maybe I'll start a Bitcoin Cafe and place of exchange in Toronto :)
