Explain "soon"

You are right too, just saying i saw a lot of post on r/bitcoin on 1.08.17 about selling the "shitcoin" bch.
If 2x was acivated , bch wouldn t probably exist now
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:42
It is because too many sold bch on 1st august.
Many believed that even 1 bch block would have been mined.
I understand their frustration..from 250 to 2800.. i would be frustrated too..

If s2x price surge is part of the bitcoin attack, then what ' s with s1x? Accidental increase?

Probably server are overloaded today...

I had the same issue this morning...just try again a couple of times and should be fine...
I think servers are overloaded due to today's tradings

Definitely monero....it has been proved it is the most secure and untraceable coin
(Disclaimer: i am not holding monero)

...do you really think that just with LN bitcoin becomes more private? No ringct, no stealth address, no special cryptography, no particular mixing and obfuscation techniques/services...
Do you really need someone to detail you these things?
If nsa (and other gov depts) can trace coin tx like zcash ones (that has some of those privacy features) why wouldn't be able to do the same with bitcoin, that has none (correct me if i am wrong)  of them?
The only untraceable coin is monero at the moment, and you could do some researches on how they achieve this important , fundamental feature.

If i want to go private , i ll surely use monero or any other privacy coin instead...bitcoin is absolutely not privacy-friendly at the moment and it will not even with ln
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:54:37
Same issue... i have also got "feature disabled" ..
Just try a few times and should be fine (it worked for me)
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:31:14
I might not understand them, so why don't you motivate how LN will make bitcoin a privacy coin?

Actually, inflation on bitcoin cash due to the eda difficulty changes is so low it doesn t matter...

Bitcoin is free...a dot.com website not..if u don't agree with the view of its owner , just ignore it
