Cracking down on the KYC (know your client) seems like a serious blow to an anonymous currency. In the US this means providing your address and other key information in order to open a bank account, etc

"bailing out the banks" is not the same as bailing out the financial system, which they indeed did

is this posted to bitcoin because you think that bitcoin is some sort of vehicle for consumers to use in order to effectively boycott the major banks? if so, you're a bit delusional. If it becomes that great, the banks just move into that capital space. shoot, a relatively minor effort by one of those banks could surely destroy bitcoin if they wanted to. Just look at what Soros could do to real national currencies

Ill give you a better analogy, and we will work up - instead of down the heroin path.
The small town and regional banks started selling heroin to the american people (houses they could not afford) the big banks saw a supply issue - these banks didnt have capital to give all this juicy heroin out, so they figured out a way to keep all the americans high by becoming the supplier (they bought the mortgages giving the banks more capital or in effect, become their 'heroin supplier'). The problem was, then americans got twice as high by doing heroin then investing in the proceeds (all those inflated returns on MBS). The banks couldnt make enough money as the money passed though them - but it was your desire to get high on a big house you can't afford that empowered it all. To say "the bank will give me the financing, i MUST be able to afford it" is just like thinking "this guy says this heroin is great and ill love it, it MUST be" - you have to recognize that everyone is out for their own best interest when it comes down to it in a capitalist society.
To add to all the big bank talk, you need to recognize that a lot of the banks that are still around and now the blunt of the criticism were the strongest banks at the time and bailed out their even more greedy peers by buying them when it would have crashed the market for them to fail. look at JPMC and BofA, they took in the weaker banks to save the system when their government called on them to. Now they have nursed those banks back to health and they are stronger than ever - who's doing was that really?
AND in the background you had the Government saying, hey heroin for everyone is great!! (get everyone in a home, even if they cant afford it) and building policies that encouraged it
