Very detailed and thought out post. I'd argue that the example from  and the high margin requirements section should really just be merged into one point. It's just a terrible trade that no one would ever do.
Also, kind of missed the chance to tell everyone manipulation like the proposed trades is highly illegal. Bitcoin does not have to be regulated for it to be illegal for someone taking part in the highly regulated futures markets to go to jail for manipulating the underlying. Anyone ponying up the kind of money it would take to do this kind of trade has to report their trades and is relatively transparent. FINRA and the CFTC would be all over someone acting like this. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:43:12
One entity can only hold so many contracts. If you get even close to that many contracts you're probably a heavily regulated financial institution and your trades will be declared. Trades like this would be highly illegal regardless of whether the underlying falls under CFTC/SEC. 
In addition, the millions of dollars you would have to put at risk by first buying and subsequently selling the underlying asset in an attempt to manipulate your settlement would dwarf the maximum amount of exposure you could get with the maximum amount of contracts. No one would do this.
Further, futures contracts can be leveled out (i.e. closed) at any time.  Why would you wait to do your massively illegal, massively risky, and massively stupid manipulation trade at the end of the contract when you could have done it at any time?
Finally, I haven't REALLY looked at the open interest on CME+CBOE but I'd be willing to make a blind bet that the number of outstanding contracts is a tiny fraction of the amount of money it would take to move 5+ exchange prices.
This futures manipulation idea needs to die. It's not happening. It will never happen. It is a conspiracy theory perpetuated by people who do not even understand what a futures contract is.

That futures markets would improve the likelihood of approval. Futures are not markets on the underlying. They want more (larger) legitimate exchanges. I haven't been following their rulings as closely as I probably should be but even if they didn't say it explicitly they also (probably) want to wait until the SEC or CFTC gets more regulatory capture on the underlying.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:02:28
First, that whole thing sounds a whole lot like a decree. Who is he to say when 'we' can discuss a base block size increase?
Second, looks to me like the market doesn't give a shit about segwit. Probably won't give a shit about Schnorr signatures or MAST either. And even if they do, this guy is talking about years before *his* goals come true.
Some people keep treating BTC like they're still whiteboarding pre-launch problems/engineering decisions at a startup. Here, in reality, the product launched in 09 and has gained a significant user base. When a huge problem became apparent they should have implemented a temporary fix and be working on all the things they are working on concurrently. Kind of like how the block size limit was a temporary fix to keep the network going. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:22:26

Eh, an investigation tops. They would never really be able to prosecute a rule 180 on a pure cash-settled derivative that they just self-regulated into existence.

Thank you for posting this.
If I were running a business that relied on BTC transactions I wouldn't want to deal with any of this shit at all. Rolling out 'solutions' that require non-mandatory adoption by so many players is such a terrible way of going about it in my opinion. 
I don't care if the next problem is how large the blocks are, how much they should weigh, if we should change the max BTC to 210 million, or if all Satoshi's coins should go into my pocket; If you want to claim something as "here's our solution to this problem" roll out your reference implementation at the same time and make it mandatory for people running your client. If it requires a fork, contentious or not, so be it. I look at half of these hair brained solutions (and sorry, including LN) and think "you're expecting how many people to willingly do this? lol."
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:08:28
People can run any software they desire. Core often claims Segwit is the stop-gap solution for scaling. I say if that's true it's being pushed in an unbelievably bad way and building further products on TOP of that unbelievably bad rollout is even more foolish.
In a "Welcome to Bitcoin!" snide way, I guess you don't remember when there was a mandatory upgrade because of a number overflow error.

The facts are really on his side on this one. Bitcoin is not the blockchain and bitcoin isn't what makes a blockchain useful. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:48:38
This is such a tough question for a fiduciary. On one hand, you can treat forks of any coin as a split and hold them indefinitely. But how do you MTM the more illiquid ones? If you're aggregating gains/loss in a pool are the gains/loss in previous splits getting distributed to new money? Is that appropriate? In stock splits, there's no risk of just the split going to 0 or becoming (and starting) so illiquid you can't appropriately mark it. 
The safest way to handle it so you don't get fucking sued is probably to sell the forks pretty quickly and distribute them as dividends as GBTC did. But what if a 'flippening' did happen (now, or on any fork in the future)? How do you distinguish a good time to sell your fork asset? What are the boundries where what was supposed to be passively managed becomes an active manager trying to time the market to offload their split assets?

If we're talking about sketchy in terms of fraud I'm not going to pretend to know. 
It's more about if you're willing to undertake the counterparty risk of a random website acting as its own clearinghouse for a thinly traded book of leveraged instruments. A bad day in the (insane vol underlying) market would wipe everyone out. Not to mention if you ever take a look at their little chat you'll see the kinds of people who are levering up on that platform unironically asking questions like "hey can someone tell me when bitcoins price is going up so I can go long"
LedgerX is the real deal because of all the things the CFTC regulation provides.

I think what you meant to say is "market cap doesn't work in cryptos" - note I didn't cite a specific number or say the words market cap. There are multiple billions of dollars at play in just bitcoin proper and all of the interests and forces that come with all of that money. 
Relative to the market, any individual (Ver) is a small fry and cannot do lasting damage to anything but himself. Thinking there are groups of "whales" or one man with a few friends on twitter can move markets (at least, as the asset has gotten more liquid now) is borderline conspiracy paranoia. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:59
When everything is a coordinated 'attack' by groups of 'whales' and we need to uncover their foul play you're a god damn conspiracy theorist.
Every time a stock/asset/anythings price moves it is not an attack on you. It is not one person, a small group of people, or coinbase. It's a collective. It's called a market and the price is made at the margin and does irrational things on both small and large timeframes, maybe you should stop staring at GDAX all day.
Just a tip, when coinbase added BCH functionality to their API a few days ago it was a pretty clear indicator that functionality (which has been announced for.. like 3 months?) was coming, and probably early. I bought some BCH because I genuinely thought they were going to allow it to be traded through their REST/FIX setup to build a orderbook for a WebAPI so you 'traders'/'investors' clicking your orders would have a smoother launch. Other people maybe thought similar.. or since it was going to be launched in a week anyway the ramp up was coming regardless.
Did some people who have relationships with coinbase employees know the launch was coming tonight? Probably. Not insider trading though and DEFINITELY not any sort of "attack"
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:18
I don't want to go too deep into the rabbit hole of potential implementations but I'll concede that any implementation wouldn't benefit me because yeah, my passport works just fine. My money also works just fine so I don't really need any Bitcoins. However, global IDs secured by no single party may make it harder for evil despots to make political dissidents 'disappear' - It may also benefit the millions of people who are born without access to government issued ID's, passports, or any of the other luxuries I enjoy. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:33:34
What the hell are you talking about? Stay on topic. The idea is that people can be interested (or see value) in other applications of the blockchain and not be interested in Bitcoin (or any currency system.) Just because Bitcoin is the 'best' or only application of 'any significance' right now doesn't mean that will be true in the future. 


This is just simply not true. Just because you don't know about something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Proof of Stake is different from Proof of Work (I'm not going to comment as to whether it is 'better') and whether it has been implemented yet is irrelevant.


Do you think that statement is profound or something? What are you even talking about here

'Insider trading' applies to securities under the purview of the SEC. Dodd Frank expands regulations to certain commodities under the purview of the CFTC. Bitcoin is neither. It would not be illegal. Armstrong saying he would take legal action against employees is half bluster half true as I'm sure there could be some sort of breach of contract etc. 
Coinbase doesn't want what WOULD be insider trading because they don't want to go to court about it at all even if they could win. They would also heavily be on the side of having Bitcoin be regulated under SEC/CFTC guidance as they would instantly become a leader in a field with very high barriers to entry. They want to act like a real MSB/exchange/brokerage and give the space legitimacy and I commend them for it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:16:50
The relevant regulation is coming anyway. There won't be any rules about when you can buy and sell, what coin miners must mine, or when products can be added to a platform, but maybe more (specific) rules on material disclosures.
I highly doubt any actual coinbase employee is taking advantage of their material information. It would be very trackable and I doubt they want to risk their billion dollar business trying to mince words in a courtroom about what a security is or isn't.

What about giving people around the world a borderless, decentralized, trustless identity? There's utility in that.

op pls
You've got to stop man. You're making us all look bad. I won't even get super pedantic here and list how insider trading doesn't exist in the space - the things you are comparing it to are fucking terrible and I'm not even sure "baking a literal human being in a gas chamber" makes sense nor was it 'legal'
Also, is insider trading THAT wrong, immoral, and unethical in a (non) commodity with no natural short? I mean, shorting the futs before a known disruption would be pretty fraudulent - I just don't think buying something, even with material information, is the crime of the century. It will be illegal soon, thats for sure, but was any HARM caused by someone buying when they 'knew' it would be listed on a popular platform? What if everyone on the popular platform hated it and sold into BCH, would it be so unethical if the price moved the way you wanted it to?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:02:16
*Some* cryptos are extremely illiquid. Bitcoin isn't anymore. Its liquidity may be distributed across many platforms and thus harder to measure than a more traditional asset but it is certainly there. It would take much more money (or coins) than Roger Ver and the whole 'axis of evil' combined to do lasting damage.
Do you think a hedge fund manager really cares what Roger Ver thinks on his multiple marketing platforms? What his 'paid shills' or whatever other shadowy figures you think are lurking on Reddit and Twitter? A bunch of stupid people might go to Bitcoin.com and genuinely believe that is the Bitcoin store or something like that - that brand of stupid doesn't generally have a whole lot of money.

You seem irrationally angry about this (among other things, considering your handle.)
Long winded responses can sometimes contain facts; sorry they are so boring to you. I'm sure it's more fun to espouse shallow talking points filled with emotion.
Anyway, I'll agree that the ratings agencies were somewhere between highly negligent and fraudulent. I don't agree that they are bank subsidiaries or somehow involved in a conspiracy to defraud anyone. How do the collapses of banks jive with your idea that the banks were committing the mass fraud? So they were defrauding themselves? Who are you even talking about profiting $3 trillion? Where does this number even come from? Is that like, the nominal value of QE?
Here are the major failures that lead to the financial crisis: 
(1) Repeal of Glass-Steagal through the Grahm-Leach-Bliley Act
(2) Financial services companies (Banks, Insurance companies, et al) creating assets by packaging underlying contracts whose default rates they thought (foolishly) were uncorrelated
(3) Financial services companies securing short-term capital through aforementioned complicated derivatives ( CDOs, CDS, CDO^2 ) in the short term repo and exchange market
Note that the  reason here, and the only way any of the proceeding actions could have become systemic failures or put any depositor funds at risk, was a law passed by elected officials. Uh oh, it's not so easy to blame evil bankers and corporations trying to control my thoughts when we as a society let this happen to ourselves, and voted in our own demise. If you want someone to blame, look no further than an ignorant populace of which you contribute to.

From what I recall from this shallow piece it basically presented the crisis as "Banks VAR went nuts overnight, they realized they were insolvent, and they dumped their assets on unsuspecting stooges." I remember them shoehorning in severance packages (e.g. golden parachutes which were such a media hot topic at the time) and "fire sales." There was also some weird scene where a banker was on a roof feeling bad about making 2 million dollars the previous year - what a crock of shit.
The movie was like a 3rd graders collage of CNN clippings trying to explain the financial crisis. It's hard for me to list out every detail because I'm not watching that piece of shit again, but just remember that the "unsuspecting stooges" buying these assets are literally banks. Only institutions traded CDOs/CDS so don't let them bamboozle you and make you think the trading system is evil. A lot of players did sort of wake up to risk profiles being crazy (A lot of risk managers lost their jobs) but the reason they were insolvent was a much more complicated ecosystem called the short term repo and exchange markets. Any "Fire sales" occurred in those markets (because no one wanted to swap CDOs when it came out they were becoming worthless, and no one wanted to sell their swaps), and those institutions that found they were insolvent were very foolishly securing their short-term operating capital in the repo market.
To be honest, a lot of the financial crisis was caused by incompetence instead of malice. A bunch of people not understanding the Gaussian copula function doesn't make a very sexy movie though.

Are we getting super pedantic here over the definition of mandatory? I already said in the first post you replied to if it caused a fork that was fine. Back in '10 when the overflow occurred the (pretty much only) client did a patch and if you didn't upgrade you were continuously trying to fork the chain with the bad block(s). You could keep running the old code I guess, in a super pedantic way, but your client would be broken and no further support was going to be offered.
I'm not suggesting core do some sort of auto-update where everyone's client is forcibly updated.

It's because he's actually trying to filter out to qualified clients, which is a higher bar ($2.1MM) than an accredited investor. It's really an incredibly stupid thing to do for a small fund. He either registered the fund in the wrong state or he was already a registered investment advisor for securities. Guess that's the kind of thing you can expect from someone who puts out an ad for their fund in a newspaper.
