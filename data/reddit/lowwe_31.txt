Didn't read the article, but it seems to contradict the fact they are printing a lot of money to keep up with debts.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:34:55
Early stages... take advantage of the imbalances.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:13:23
It is kinda low now AFAIK, but not looking good long term. Bullish setup for cryptos IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:57:30
Ok, but how to verify the work without doing it yourself too?
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:07:08
Just swap 'reddit' with 'everyone' and 'Bitcoin' with 'anything'
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:21:38
Dollar will die and every tx will be with crypto
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:37:34
At least someone here sees thru the hype cloud.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:45:10
Wait until it become controlled by the government and tell me it is a perfect asset.
Same history happened with the internet, they said it would be the perfect means of free speech, now look where we are with Ajit Pai, etc...
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:24:02
Soon to be illegal/outside isp packages. We'll see.

Oh, thanks for your BTC too.
Sincerely, your average hodler.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:20:11
God hear ya
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:14:24
Yeah, exactly what was said about the internet. Just a network of computers connected to eachother, how can it possibly be controlled, sensored, surveilled? Impossible!
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:38:48
It is not... scarcity depends on demand.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:12:07
It is decentralized until it's not. Explain to me exactly how it is not possible to do with miners the same thing they did with ISP's now? Net neutrality is gone, btc neutrality can go just as easy.
I know all about how it works btw, ty.

You don't? They rule the world's finance for centuries.

Bitcoin is a tool, nothing else. Wether it is good or bad depends on how we use it.
I like to make a parallel with the birth of the internet, where ppl also touted it as a ultimate tool for 'free speech'. 'Decentralized information' they said. They can't censor me because the internet is just a bunch of computers connected to eachother right? The privacy and free speech are intrinsic to the technology.
It turns out they could, and they stripped you of every right to privacy and free speech. People just react with a pathetic online comment war.
These elites can do whatever the fuck they want, because ppl don't care enough. The sooner you realize that you can't start a revolution against these guys while sitting on your ass ("believing in the tech" give me a break), the better chances you have for actual freedom.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:35:10
No, it is not. It will become the ultimate tool for enslaving people.
Bitcoin after gaining mass adoption will inevitably be stripped of its privacy and decentralization features, thus giving total control to the elites.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:52:52
Bitcoin will be just as effective against the elites as a weight loss pill for example. The reason they are so popular is ppl always look for the simple turnkey solution to solve all their problems but they refuse to do any actual work.


You said yourself: "International finance clique". How is that different than a "global elite"?
b) 


Come again?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:29:44
It is not a threat to the clique, it was created by them IMO. They will find a way to turn bitcoin into a controlling device that will give them even more power.

How important is such top notch attorney in these cases? Why wouln't a state provided attorney do the trick since they had no case at all?
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:58:49
It looks pretty random since they had no case at all.
So any of us could be the next.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:47:03
I see that, but given the govt has no case whatsoever, it should be really just elbow grease instead of highly skilled work. At least that is how I assume it works (I don't know).
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:09:54
What is that fixation ppl have to buy one entire btc? What difference does it make?
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:44:27
My tax money pays them, so me. They do (or should) work for me.
So if the govt wants to screw with my life I can't go for public defenders? (Honest question, I don't know how it works)
