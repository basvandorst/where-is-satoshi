The Drachma has been incredibly stable and non volatile for over 3 years. It's value has barely shifted in that time.

But a [Bit-O-Honey]( is not a chocolate bar, it's a candy bar. All chocolate bars are candy bars, but not all candy bars are chocolate bars. Get it?Edit: [The exception]( 6 year old me was traumatized by this stealth vileness.

What type of evidence do you have that he is a *paid* troll. Likely someone who sees bitcoin as a cult of personality, and finds the rise he can get out of enthusiasts entertaining.

Hell, not even that extreme.Walk into many "smoke shops" in states where weed is illegal and ask to see "that red *bong*" and you'll be shown the door right quick. Don't even think about mentioning marijuana by any name in the shop.

*"Oh, that would make a nice place to fish. I like fishing, but I'm not a very good fisherman. I always throw the fish back into the water, just put a band-aid on his mouth, tap 'im on the patootie and let him on his way. And maybe some day, if I'm lucky, I'll get to catch him again."*

What about implementation and integration into their system, employee training, pos equipment, volitility, etc. Even if some to these costs are negligible is there enough use of BTC to make it profitable?

Actually if I break into your house and steal a bunch of DVDs, I start to watch one and see it's a video of you diddling a 7yo with a barbed wire baseball bat. I can take that to the cops and tell them I stole it from your address. That shit is admissible.
