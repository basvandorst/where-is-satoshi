Whale Dump Sunday is taking bitcoin down now.  I'd wait a while to buy in.  You'll get it at 30 bucks per bitcoin then.  
Maybe by then the community will take it seriously.  Probably not though since it's mostly comprised of libertarians that only know one deformed way of thinking.

Just keep doing your thing.   It's just that way right now.  Try to use the currency.  Keep what you want to save and use the rest.  Pay people with it.  That's the best way to get them to use it and link bank accounts/etc.

Police, courts, a standing army, laws, lawmakers, govt. workers they are all a part of the govt.  Lol.  You'll be ok.
You know you can choose to be a human and not a member of some philosophy club. As soon as you choose some rigid ideology you lose 20 iq points.
You do what works.  That's the bottom line.

You're living in a libertarian make believe world.  Absent government with a real motivation to govern fairly, monopolies will hire people to shoot you in the fucking head, kill your family and burn your competing business.
I wanted to shoot a guy the other day that had his pit bull come after me.  I have an AK-47.  I looked around to see if anyone would see.  I would have walked out there and done it had I thought I could get away with it or the government wouldn't come after me.
See how that works.

Bottom line:  Bitcoin will become more secure and more solid in value as it is used.  I am now using it to pay international programmers.  How are you using it?
If you want it to become a reality, hoarding is fine, but use it also.  
Usage draws interest and more usage and more value.

All hail the mighty and powerful free market where monopolies are formed and competition is stifled worse than with big government.
One would never think there could be a proper balance.

This is how it becomes a valid currency.

US govt doesn't want value to flow into bitcoin easily.  That's all this is.

We need an easy way to get money into bitcoin and rate limits on sell orders that are just clear manipulations.

This is how the government is attempting to crush it.  Basically, it's very hard to get into, people will lose interest.

Don't think I'm pro government.  I'm just not an idealist.  It's all about power and control folks no matter what you call the form: government, monopoly, big business.
