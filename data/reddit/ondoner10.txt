What is driving the volatility today and what will cause it to be stable, yet still increasing by predictable amounts each year?
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:41:40
Yeah I understand all of that. My point is that if it's going to ever be used as a legit currency where you can imagine goods and services even being priced in BTC, it cannot work with the volatility we currently have. Something that costs 0.05 BTC this week might cost 0.12 BTC next week and 0.02 BTC in a month. That volatility simply doesn't work for every day use as a currency.

This clearly demonstrates that you do not understand basic economics.

Ok good luck with the IRS. Exchanging BTC for ETH is, to me, the same as exchanging gold for silver. So in your own example that is taxable. Also, 18k gold is most definitely a different asset from 24k gold so with all due respect I suggest you find a new CPA. They have different exchange rates and if you exchange one for the other you must begin a new basis, which means you must take whatever gain or loss you had on the first one for tax purposes.

Ok but here is my honest question. Is it an investment or a currency? Certainly people trade currencies like USD and GBP and EUR as investments, but the value of those currencies is dictated by the usability of the currency and the future prospects of the underlying economy, and they are extremely stable. Cryptos aren't really linked to any underlying economy to speak of and they are for sure not stable. Stability is one of the main things that make a currency usable (and investable); growth and ROI is one of the main things that make investments useful. Cryptos can't seem to decide if they're pro growth or pro stability but in order to be seriously accepted as either currency or investment it's gotta be one or the other

Can you cite to me where they say explicitly that exchanging cryptoA for cryptoB is not a taxable event? If not, then you are also putting unstated words in IRS non statements. If so, then there's no debate and I'll be wrong. Problem is no such specific guidance exists so we have to refer to other property gain/loss guidance. If you do this, you'll find that in the majority of situations, exchanging one property for another is a taxable event. If I exchange my house which I bought for $150k for my neighbors house, which he bought for $200k, assuming our basis and depreciation are equal, then I have a taxable gain of $50k and he has a taxable loss of $50k.

This guy is wrong. Don't listen to him. IRS treats cryptocurrency as a property and general property considerations apply to gains and losses. 
Think of it as the same as if you were in the business of buying and selling property on eBay. Every time you sell a piece of property you have a taxable event regardless of what you do with the proceeds.
For the purpose of making this explanation simpler, imagine if you had a brokerage account where you traded in other commodities such as oil and gold. If you purchase $1000 worth of gold, sell it for $1500 and in turn purchase $1500 in oil, you have a capital gain of $500. It is important to note that perhaps the confusion is when it comes to certain investment vehicles such as 401k or IRA. In these cases, because there is a separate and specific tax code for these type of accounts, gains and losses aren't necessarily taxable until the money is withdrawn from the account. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY. As soon as your gain has been REALIZED, it is taxable. If you sell $1500 in BTC and buy ETH, this is definitely a taxable event. 
Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and should not be taken as such. I am an accountant with 8+ years in public accounting and I know that every situation is different, which is why you should always get a professional opinion. Talk to a tax accountant before filling your taxes if you have bought and sold cryptocurrency in this year or other years I guess  (Having said that, I am very confident that selling gains from one cryptocurrency is a taxable event regardless of whether you use the funds to buy another cryptocurrency or if you cash out to fiat.)

First, I am guessing the IRS would tell you that if you exchange 24 karate gold for 18 karate gold, that would be a taxable event because your basis in your investment, or holding, changes. Once you cease to own one asset and begin ownership in another, your tax basis changes and therefore it's most likely a taxable event.
Second, yes, the specific language in that very link is as follows -
"The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer."
Translation is that sale OR EXCHANGE of cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains and losses, to what extent would be dependent on "whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer."
While there is some room for determining what "capital asset in the hands of" means, I would definitely err on the side of being conservative and check with a tax professional. As a non tax accountant with 8 years experience at least some of which was spent dealing with the IRS, my assumption is that yes it is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer and therefore exchanges and sales are both subject to capital gains tax law.

Ok, that's not really what we're talking about. The equivalent of that in cryptocurrency world would be if I owned 1 BTC and exchanged it for 2x 0.5 BTC. Which would be retarded. I'd end up worse off due to fees and what not. Why would I do that? 
Here's a better example. I own 1 BTC worth $15k and I exchange it for 5 ETH worth $15k, right? I got 5 things each worth $3k in exchange for 1 thing worth $15k. Even trade, therefore non taxable? Not quite. My gain on this exchange depends on my basis in the BTC aka what it cost me. If it was worth more than the cost when I exchange it, I absolutely have a taxable gain. 
Here's a non cryptocurrency example of the same principal. I buy 10 shares of company A at $10 per share. 1 year later its worth $15 per share and I decide to exchange it with a friend who owns 15 shares of company B worth $10 per share. In this case, my ownership of company A ends and I have to recognize a gain of $5 per share, even though I get the same value back. Absolutely there is a taxable event here, even though I never cash out and I get the same value back. 
In all seriousness, this will be a very hot button issue for the IRS and like op said if you want cryptocurrency to be taken seriously you have to pay the necessary taxes on the gains! The quickest way to shut this whole thing down is having newly minted millionaire cryptocurrency moguls go to jail for tax evasion. Seriously, talk to an accountant. Don't ruin it for everyone else.

For real though. Dude probably owes $2k in taxes

For real though, sometimes when you book a hotel or plane ticket or some other reservation, you do still have to print your confirmation. So, yeah, you probably will still have to exchange Bitcoin for fiat in the future

Not really. The idea behind any loan is that if I'm a bank and I loan you money, I'm basically betting that your loan will allow you to create more VALUE. So if it's a business loan then the assumption is that your business will generate cash flow and profit that will cover your loan plus interest. If it's a mortgage the assumption is that this is an investment that will increase in value and so long as you have the economic resources to cover the loan plus interest then my loan to you will never be under water, since my loan likely has your home as collateral. So I, as a bank, would never loan you money without relatively high assurance that you'll be able to use the funds to create more value, not more money. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:38:52
This is stupid and misses the point by a long shot. Retail banks don't create money out of nothing when they make loans any more than I create money out of nothing if I loaned my parents some BTC to get their foot in the door with crypto and only asked for my initial capital and 1% back in return. Cental banks maybe more so when they give interest free cash infusions, or stimulous to retail and investment banks. Maybe that's what it's going for? But those aren't loans and banks that do make loans are generally not central banks so either way it's either flat out wrong or misleading and poorly worded. Not to mention that the basic creation of money isn't really the problem, it's more having a centralized authority who can manipulate the supply and value of said money. A bank making a loan does not increase or decrease the supply of money. They have some money and they give some of it to you and in return you have to pay them back with more money, which you'll earn some other way. Loans have nothing to do with the creation or manipulation of money supply.

I'm sorry you feel like I was doing the same thing. I don't feel that way at all. Let's recap: I said that this post was stupid and then proceeded to lay out the rational reasons why. They took offense to that and resorted to calling me a liar, a dumbass, deceptive and ignorant. Impuning my character and resorting to name-calling is a fairly objectevely assholery thing to do. No? So I called it that while also making sure to point out that his rational argument about my rational argument was actually a good one. And all of this, makes me an asshole? �� I was acting in an assholery way? If you think that, I'm terribly sorry. Homie threw the first punches, and all I did was say, hey no need to throw punches. And I'm so terribly sorry that those actions caused you enough distress to chime in and tell me that in fact I was being an asshole all along. My deepest apologies. Please forgive me.

Ok. Totally fair about the risks of fractional banking, but that still isn't creating money supply. If a bank makes a loan that is defaulted on, the bank loses money and the recipient of the loan gains the same amount of money that the bank incurred as a loss. That's assuming there's no collateral involved. So it's a zero sum thing, money is neither created nor destroyed in this process. Over extending your bank with excess loans or loans tied to collateral that has uncertain or inpaired value is certainly risky and can lead to economic calamities such as we saw in 2008. Still not money creation though.
Also good point about central banks purpose being to create money... To a degree. But still, that's not what the sticker says, the sticker specifically says banks making loans. In reality that doesn't mean central bank creating money. Maybe it's a bad translation or whatever, but the actual translation of banks making loans doesn't have much of anything to do with central banks or creating money.

Ok. Sorry to offend you. Please forgive me. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:31:31
Not really. Loans are defaulted on all the time. The ball out happened once. Banks take the losses and are generally covered by private insurance. See AIG
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:59:19
Right. The assumptions were all wrong. Turned out that the value of a lot of these mortgages was impaired and could not be recouped, thus the banks would incur significant losses, which in turn would cause the insurance companies to pay out significant settlements, which in turn would cause some of them to be insolvent. Ahhh the risks of fractional reserve banking. 
However, this still hasn't had any effect of the supply of money. Wealth and value took a hit, sure, but money supply stayed the same. Well, that is until the Fed started it's stimulous packages. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:33:08
It's certainly implied when it says "make loans". Does the Fed make loans?

Well clearly the Swiss have a bank fetish so why wouldn't it be about the most powerful bank on Earth?

Lol ok. That's actually a good point about the difference between me lending BTC to my parents and banks lending cash money they don't have. However, your good point is degraded in large order by your assholery. Why the dickishness? 
Either way, it still has nothing to do with money creation. The bank can loan, let's say 10x, but if it's all defaulted on (assuming no collateral) the bank will incur significant losses. There is no creation or destruction of money. I'd like to say that your comment is complete nonsense and pure ignorance and that you're in fact the dumbass for not understanding basic economics and accounting and banking principles. But... That's not my style. Just be cool man. Civil discussion is great. Assholery is not fun for anyone. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:13:34
Yup. That's how banking works since a long long time ago. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:34:21
Yeah totally. So just to clarify though, fiat currency is not the same as fractional reserve banking. There are some ways they're connected but fundamentally they're very different concepts. Bitcoin in and of itself is also not a monetary policy. Nor is fiat currency. A monetary policy can include specific details regarding fiat or crypto currency. The currency itself is not the monetary policy. 
Let's just use one specific micro economic example. You are a inventor and you have a cool widget you want to manufacture. Your widget costs $1 to make, you can make 5,000 per month and you sell them for $5 each. So you have gross profit of $20,000 per month. Not bad.
I am a small startup bank. I have $5m in cash but I've also made $15m in loans. I have enough debt service (ie monthly payments of principal plus interest from the people I've loaned money to) to cover my costs and keep at least $5m in cash reserves at any given time. 
You come to me and say you need a $100,000 loan. Even though I have $15m in loans outstanding to my $5m cash reserves (in other words, if all of my customers went bankrupt and defaulted at the same time today, I would have a loss of $10m and could possibly become insolvent and have to declare bankruptcy myself), I'm willing to give you the $100,000 because your business has gross margins of 500% so I can charge you interest of 9% over 36 months and you'll still have enough gross margin to cover overhead costs, pay yourself and not go out of business. Your business will have the cash flow to be able to pay me back at 9% and remain solvent, so I'm willing to offer you credit even though I'm already leveraged beyond my actual cash reserves. 
That's basically fractional reserve banking. By the way, this type of arrangement could be made via crypto as well. In fact, smart contacts are very likely to be a massive emerging market for credit lenders. Insurance companies would jump all over being able to write a code that would prevent their client (the bank) from incurring significant losses due to their customers (homeowners, business owners, etc) defaulting, if there can be certain programming language written into a loan agreement such that the risk of defaulting is mitigated significantly and the risk of incurring significant losses in the case of default is also mitigated due to the triggering of certain automated actions.
