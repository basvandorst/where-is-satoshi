My only beef with this is apps like venmo are not instantaneous. The money is immediately "yours", but to actually deposit it to your linked bank account has historically taken me a few days.

If you have watched any videos involving Andreas Antonopoulos, you would know that there are literally billions of people who have yet to adopt cryptocurrency in their daily lives, and as it stands right now, Bitcoin accounts for 30% of that. $50,000 is cheap.

Personally, I just don't like the idea that people hard-forked Bitcoin because they didn't get their way. I think that Bitcoin would be better off right now if some of the BTC miners didn't shift their focus over to Bcash. Still shitting the bed on the mempool, but better. Same goes for Bitcoin Gold. Imagine if those forks never happened; the market cap on BTC would be $30B bigger and BTC wouldn't be &lt;50% total crypto market cap.
Also, for what it's worth, Litecoin was always an alternative to Bitcoin. But then again, Bcash is trying to take over BTC so nevermind.
DISCLAIMER: JUST MY OPINION

He lost profits. Bcash has underperformed BTC in the past month. Of course, he probably still made out well, but the grass is always greener.

Honestly, I don't think it's suspicious. These key moments could happen due to FOMO buying where thousands of accounts are being created and trying to make transactions simultaneously. I wouldn't expect these outages to happen when bitcoin is stagnant.

TL;DR: Yeah, GDAX has no fees depending on how you buy.
The way I look at it, if you don't have money deposited into GDAX, then coinbase will let you lock in a price for immediate purchase, with a fee (but your coins won't be delivered to your coinbase wallet for likely over a week). With GDAX, your money has to already be deposited in order to buy, which takes about 5 days. But it allows you to make limit orders, which have no fees at all, and you can place market orders instantly for a lower fee than coinbase which is between 0.10-0.25% for BTC books and 0.10-0.30% for ETH books.
The best way to go about investing using GDAX IMO is to deposit money reguluarly into GDAX and limit buy slightly under market (by a few dollars) to ensure your limit gets filled. You can also use bank wires to get your money into GDAX in the same day (if done before 1pm Pacific time, otherwise next business day), but because it's $10, you should only do that for larger deposits.
GDAX is a well-made and easy-to-use exchange which you can utilize to constantly buy and sell bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin as a day trader if you'd like, but just know that you should definitely move your coins out of there and hold them in a paper wallet or a hardware wallet. I recommend Ledger Nano S, Trezor, or Keepkey.
Hope this helps.

That was what I was trying to get at. I have savings for short term emergencies and then I have my investments which I will use to make big purchases like buying a house one day if I'm lucky. The point of having my money invested is that it will (hopefully) grow faster than inflation as I continue to invest in things like mutual funds and index funds. That way, 12 years down the line, my principle could potentially double on top of whatever else I've continued investing to grow.
The only reason I'm holding onto crypto is because it's not mature enough to use in real world situations. If I could get my hands on a Litepay debit card and run a direct deposit for a small part of my paychecks, I would do it in a heartbeat. That way I could use crypto for actual commerce the way it is intended.

Someone hoarding their money under a mattress obviously doesn't understand that their money could be growing if they invested it in something like an index fund. Unless they're hoarding the money illegally to avoid taxes, which is actually even worse. This actually is hurting the economy.

More people should be aware that there are ways to make your money work for you. Finance classes should be brought into high school because I didn't learn shit about investing until I stumbled upon r/personalfinance

That's not how the world works, man. You have no idea how much this economy would lose if people didn't invest their money into things. Imagine if the government said "fuck it, why pay for NASA to do research when we could *save* our money?"

Ledger nano s, Trezor, keepkey, buy one and send your coins like a normal transaction

You can save for retirement very easily by investing in bonds which grow slightly faster than the rate of inflation.

Agreed. Worst i got when wiring money was the guy saying "hey man are you sure you want to waste your money on this stuff?".
I told him i have a mutual fund portfolio and a 401(k), and collecting bitcoin is a hobby of mine. He wasn't as worried after that.
