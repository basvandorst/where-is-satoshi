IOR is new.  If the Fed just abruptly stops paying IOR, things might get a bit dicey.
Presumably the Fed has a plan for draining the excess reserves and then eliminating the then redundant IOR.  Hopefully, its more robust than "let's just stop paying it!"

The profits from IOR are measured in dollars, which are fungible.  So, I suppose in a sense, some amount of IOR profits end up in banker bonuses.  One could just as easily say that they end up in retiree 401k accounts or worker paychecks or wherever.  That's not their purpose though.

The changes in Bitcoins value versus the dollar are supply and demand related.  When the price of quinoa skyrockets because soccer moms jump on the latest craze, we don't call that dollar deflation against quinoa, we call that increased quinoa demand.

Are you confusing monetary base with monetary supply?

Enthusiasts like to fantasize about how everyone will start using bitcoin instead of their credit cards, but its not going to happen.  Bitcoin serves a purpose, but its fundamental flaws make it a non-starter for the masses as a primary form of money.
Unless and until someone steps up and offers the same guarantees that a bank account offers, it will never achieve significant adoption for mainstream transactions.

No credit union lists FDIC insurance, because FDIC insurance is for banks.  Credit unions are covered through a program administered by the NCUA.  It is analogous to FDIC insurance and also a Federal program.


No private insurer can possibly have larger dollar denominated funding than the Federal government.  That's the real world.
Most people have no idea how the dollar sausage is made.  But, they do know that the government pulls the strings and if needed can bail any bank out.  No private insurer can ever say that.  
A bitcoin denominated insurer would need bitcoin assets at least as large as their largest client.  Neither the FDIC nor the NCUA have that requirement.  
Remember, bitcoin works completely differently than the modern financial system.  The modern financial system is a central bank based fractional reserve (i.e. debt based) system.  Things that work under its auspices simply won't work the same under bitcoin's deflationary system.
Think about what it would take to be a large bitcoin denominated insurance company.  If it doesn't quickly occur to you why the cost of your insurance would make it too expensive for anyone to purchase, go back and think about it some more.


The system we have today offers security + convenience.  Where's the pressing need for the public to switch?


Horses and cars are not money.  
However, if you want to know where bitcoin value lies, you need to stop thinking of it as a replacement for the banking system and start thinking of it as semi-anonymous cash.

Its 3% for tiny banks.  10% is the more realistic reserve requirement ratio.
As others have mentioned, going below the reserve ratio used to be a common occurrence.  When we talk about the Fed setting "interest rates" what we're actually talking about is the inter-bank loan rates used to shuffle excess reserves from one bank to another to keep within the 10% RRR.  
In a true emergency, a bank can go to the discount window at the Federal Reserve and ask to borrow reserves to keep within the mandated minimum.  Do this often enough and the Fed will take action to close you or force you to merge into a stronger bank.
A "bank run" in the classical sense is a practical impossibility in the United States.  The Federal Reserve has an endless ability to inject cash into the banking system.  Think back to the panicky days at the start of the Great Recession.  More fear about the future than anytime since the Great Depression and yet, not even an inkling of widespread concern about a bank run.
Today, banks are sitting on heaping gobs of excess reserves beyond what's legally mandated.  This is due to the QE programs in which the Fed trades their cash for US treasuries.  The cash from these purchases ends up in bank accounts and eventually on deposit at the Federal Reserve, where it earns a nominal interest rate.
There's a lot of confusion out there about the purpose of the QE programs.  People seem to think its a recapitalization of the banking system, but that's not really the point.  The Fed can recapitalize the banking system without the extraordinary measures taken in QE.  QE is a response to the falling money multiplier.  This falling money multiplier was causing a dramatic nosedive in the money supply, which was causing price deflation - generally considered a Really Bad Thing.
To combat the falling money multiplier and keep stability in the money supply, the monetary base was jacked up to compensate.  
In the sense that the deflation was stopped in its tracks, it worked.  Long term, there are some tricky issues to work through so the jury is still out.
Point is that the money printing really doesn't have anything to do with recapitalizing the banks nor with paying banker bonuses.

The FDIC + Banking System + Federal Reserve + Federal Government all have a part in guaranteeing that you are protected against money being wrongly stolen from your bank account, that you can withdraw on demand, and that there can be no such thing as a run on a bank.
Speculative froth is boiling over when (presumably) rational people start seriously suggesting that the bitcoins on their hard drives are every bit as safe as the money in their banks.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:22:47
Because it isn't recapitalizing the banks.  I think perhaps you are conflating QE and TARP.
TARP was designed to take troubled assets off the books of the banks and help clean their balance sheets.  That was a Treasury Department program.
The QE choices for asset purchases aren't about saving banks as the banks have long since been saved.  QE choices are about forcing liquidity into credit markets for short term debt, long term debt, and securitized debt.  That liquidity translates into lower interest rates at a time when the Fed is sitting on the zero bound.  
The Fed wants interest rates low and it wants slight inflation.  Without QE, interest rates would be rising and there's a high likelihood we'd be seeing deflation (you can see it in the price indexes if you go back and look).
(You also may be conflating "mortgage backed securities" with "subprime mortgage backed securities.")
Its also worth noting that the banks do not need any additional capital.  Indeed, they are so flush with cash that the Federal Reserve has to pay them interest on their excess reserves in order to keep them from doing stupid things with the money.  Figuring out how to drain those excess reserves is one of the troubling issues with QE.
If all you wanted to do was recapitalize banks though, you wouldn't need QE - there are other tools for that.  
Ultimately, as I said, what the Fed is trying to do is prevent deflation since deflation leads to ruin.
Check out  and notice that the money multiplier cratered as the crisis unfolded.  
At the same time, notice that the Fed jacket the monetary base up to compensate (that's QE)  as the actual money supply is a function of both base and multiplier.
This was a similar scenario to one faced at the start of the Great Depression.  Back then, the Fed reacted incorrectly and allowed the money supply to fall (even managing to help it along), deflation to occur, and global financial disaster resulted.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:21:19


It very likely also would have led to accelerating deflation and a second Great Depression.  We've been down this road before.  Plunging money multiplier leading to price deflation leading to a generation in soup kitchen lines.
The Fed didn't say, "let's do QE to make the banks richer," the Fed said "been there, done that, not going to stand by and let it happen again."

No, it can't.
Deposit insurance is a Federal program.  The Federal government can and would make good on anything beyond what the insurance program could pay.
No private insurer could even come close to that.  
A bigger better online wallet is just a bigger better target for thieves (internal and external).
Bitcoin may have a place in the global financial system, but it isn't as a replacement for John and Jane Q Public's national currencies.  Its (more or less) anonymous digital cash that allows for trusted transactions to occur between any two parties in the world immediately and outside the banking system.  
The idea that people are going to give up their bank accounts and switch to bitcoins is a bubble induced fantasy.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:17:53
My accounts get locked down regularly.  If anything looks weird to the banks computers, they lock the account until they can talk to you.
Its a pain in the ass when they do it - especially when the transactions are all legitimate, but I can understand their position.  They are on the hook if someone steals money out of your account.
With my business account for example, about every six months it gets locked.  And, in the cases where the fraud was actually fraud, they get super paranoid for a while and start rejecting transactions that we've been doing for years.  Takes a few phone calls to get their computers to reset to a less paranoid approach.
To me, this is worth it because I know the money's safe regardless of whether someone steals it or not.  With bitcoin, no bank will stop me from sending coins around, but if they get stolen, no bank will step in and make good either.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:41:28
So, originally, you suggested that there was no issue with bitcoin security because banks aren't really secure.  Having been proven factually incorrect, you now assert that the security of a bank account doesn't matter for the masses because no one has any money anyway.
Folks who believe that bitcoin will somehow gain traction from the masses aren't even thinking one step into the future.  Crime really will pay when you can mug someone for the entirety of their liquid wealth rather than just the money in their wallet.
And, to top it off, you haven't given a single reason why anyone would even want to use bitcoins for most transactions in the first place.  In what possible way is bitcoin superior to a debit card for buying your groceries?  Or paying your mortgage?  Or getting a happy meal for the kids?
And yet, there's this mass delusion among bitcoin speculators that we're somehow going to switch from dollars or euros or whatevers to bitcoins.  Daytraders, true believers, and the gullible are panic buying and watching charts and arguing over whether the "true value" of a bitcoin is ten thousand or hundred thousand or maybe even a million dollars apiece. Its absolutely bafflingly stupid.

Having your PIN stolen is not a big problem.  Call the bank within two days and be liable for $50 (which they'll typically waive).  Wait longer than 2 days and be liable for up to $500.  Only if you don't open your bank statements or notice your empty account for longer than 60 days are you liable for the total amount stolen.
With bitcoin, if they are lost or stolen, you are out of luck.  No recourse at all.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:18:25
I was being kind.  If you aren't conflating then you are just purposefully ignorant.
 is pretty self explanatory.
The banks are capitalized to the gills and have been for quite some time.  They don't need the money they are getting from the Fed and have to be enticed to take it.
The reason you don't want to continue this discussion is because reality conflicts with your worldview.  You should educate yourself on how the Federal Reserve actually works and what and why its actually doing.  
And, if you are worried about bank recap, you should *really* be worried about deflation.  Among other problems, deflation causes good loans to go bad en masse, which is obviously a disaster for banks.
Not a bugaboo - you can go back a look at the price level data and see it.  Keynesian economists don't like deflation, but are hardly alone in that.  Anyone with a brain between their ears should easily be able to project forward some of the consequences.  Or, they could open a history book or two and read about it.
Or, instead of learning, you could argue within the echo chamber of your particular choir.  You can lead a horse to water and all that...

The normal Joe would be rioting in the streets if deflation hit.  Not only would he be thrown out of work, he'd lose his house because he wouldn't be able to pay back the ever-increasing real dollar monthly mortgage.  
You don't need to trust me, you just have to crack open a history book and learn about the economic history of the Great Depression.
If you want to argue that QE was a bad idea, you are going to have to do better than claptrap about the wonders of deflation.
