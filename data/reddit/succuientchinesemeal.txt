Even completely unrelated ads are using bitcoin. I saw a one where a guy was comparing profitability of holding bitcoin vs running a store on amazon. How are these things comparable? Holding bitcoin is a job now?

Yes. The wallet has the private keys. Some wallet software does not show them for safety and because you don't need to know your private keys for the wallet to function.

Well it is, because bitcoin is opt in and the market is free and open, so anything that artificially hinders growth of bitcoin, whether it be putting people off with inflated fees or them not being able to get anything into the next block, displaces bitcoin as *the* cryptocurrency. If two services are identical, no one chooses the more expensive one. The cheapest wins, whether that be Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, whatever.
Raising the limit may be a risk, but freezing it arbitrarily at such an early stage in bitcoins development is certain death.

Increasing the block size and using a transaction-consolidation network are not mutually exclusive.
Raising the block size is about avoiding any stifling of network growth.

It is a solution, albeit temporary. But it is still currently the only solution, because nothing like LN is ready yet, and won't be for years.
Something like LN will be needed because if bitcoin grows to 10m/100m users it will ossify anyway, no more updates will be possible to the core protocol. But it isn't the solution for 2015, its the solution for 2018/20, and if bitcoin growth gets artificially restricted, it won't get to 2018/20

Its literally cloneable, which means all the software and hardware (non-mining) easily multi purposed over to an alt. Again, the only reason bitcoin is worth more than an alt currently is that more people use bitcoin. Bitcoin only survives if it retains crypto market share of users, and it cant do that by being more expensive. The "inertia" is built on the back of speculators that aren't going to stick around for full blocks and network tx backlogs

The point is they are creating redundant systems.
@_date: 2015-08-06 02:08:36
From an end users perspective they are, and bitcoin is easily cloned.


All transactions are equally valid, and they all take up space. Most serious bitcoiners are holders only because of its future potential for mainstream use (which is also priced into todays value), once that goes, their reason to hold goes. A 'high fee' crypto just has its users (and therefore holders) migrate to the low fee one.

That isn't relevant to me, I don't have an opinion on bitcoins growth targets, I just corrected you're comprehension of Grix's statement. He said it plateaued, you read it as peaking, but they are not equivalent.

r/investing is extremely risk averse. Being invested in something that fluctuates 4% is a white knuckle ride for them. They'd be among the last people to hold something like bitcoin.

Gold isn't easily and indefinitely clone-able, it has values which make it unique, from which it derives its value. Bitcoins value comes from its user base. The only reason bitcoin is worth more than litecoin currently is that more people use bitcoin. The only reason more people use bitcoin than litecoin is because network effects played strongly in its favor up to this point in its history.
Bitcoin isn't just competing with bank fees, its competing with other cryptos for user base ie the thing that is giving it value as a transactional network in the first place.
There is no "high value transaction crypto network". It isn't possible, cryptos are too liquid. There is nothing keeping users on it, keeping them from using it over any other crypto.

It may or may not be awful, but "flatlining growth" still isn't the same as a peak.

Except it gives people more time to develop an overlay network, which would significantly improve the situation.

Bitcoin is the first asset in history that you can transact over distance without a third party. It is also the only asset where physical law of ownership supersedes all other contracts. Its basically a global bearer bond backed by maths instead of contract law.

You don't understand the security model. You are not getting the same thing for cheaper. You are getting a less secure transaction for cheaper. This is why shitcoins have no fees.

Myth? The decentralized security of the network is determined by it. Miners are not mining for charity.

Cryptocurrency market cap isn't equatable to company market cap. Nothing has fundamentally changed with bitcoin compared to say 1 month ago. Identical to each of the last btc crashes. It's just hype cycles, positive feedback loops followed by negative feedback loops.

Similar to my experience. Like the multi coin support of ledger but as of late it has been failing to send eth transfers and there is little customer support. IMO a Trezor is worth the extra expense.

I've been in crypto for a while. What's happening now is completely standard. If you look at a graph of bitcoin price over the last year it resembles each of the previous bitcoin bubbles. Bitcoin grows in bubbles. It doesn't have a board of directors managing inflation to create price stability. There is no marketing department to run ads and PR for bitcoin. All bitcoin marketing is word of mouth from its user base. Price rises feed marketing (news + social media) which in turn feeds the price via change in demand. You end up with strong feedback loops in both directions.
The new-ish people around the space don't realize that this is normal for bitcoin, expected even, making them skittish, increasing short term volatility. 
There will be articles proclaiming bitcoins death from people that were not around in 2013, convinced that this crash signals the end. Its just part of the cycle.

The point of the fork is to pump ZCL. The devs creating the fork buy up a load of ZCL then create buying pressure by announcing holders get the new amazing fork coin, meanwhile they are selling into the buy pressure and on fork/exchange adding day the price dumps

Middle ground: dollar cost average in, which is buying a small amount periodically rather than a large sum all at once.

It's actually completely rational to not allow crypto purchases on credit. I expect more crypto-on-credit bans to happen in future and I don't think it is much of an issue.
Reversible payments for an irreversible asset isn't sustainable, you are going to get too much fraud.

The bad news: This does not describe most of those people that got into bitcoin in the past year, the vast majority of which where buying in to speculate on price. All they know about bitcoin is the price as this is all the info that the mass media propagates. This is also what caused the alt bubble and is the reason why technologically poor and scam coins pumped.
The good news: The biggest holders do share this ideal. Those that do not get shaken out in crashes and those ideologically aligned with the idea of bitcoin buy up when no one else wants to and so profit the most on price recoveries.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:36:05
It illustrates that focusing on the crashes is missing the bigger picture. The pumps and crashes are what gets the headlines but they have nothing to do with what is actually happening fundamentally. 
By every valuable metric bitcoin has been steadily growing over time. This crash won't change that for the same reasons the last 5 crashes didn't.

I'd say its more that people do not understand money. People think that the notes in their wallets are valuable in of themselves, instead of understanding that the value is an abstraction, a quantitative measure of our trust in the community and mechanisms that establish the value of that money.
Bitcoin forces people to relearn what they think money and value is. And because in the modern world capitalism is a religion, money being the deity at its center, bitcoin crashes against their ideological framework. That's why people cannot just ignore it, they are strong proponents or display open disdain for it, to protect their own beliefs.

They're not overlapping skill sets. Casual users and lawyers are not going to be upgrading the protocol.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:22:39
Bitcoin doesn't need awareness, people are well aware of its existence. What the BCH crowd doesn't understand is that people are only going to use a crypto that they own (no one buys a crypto just to tip a waitress when you can tip in fiat) and they are only going to own a crypto that they can safely keep ie store value in. Doesn't matter how many people accept it, if a single mining pool controls the whole hash rate no one is keeping their savings in BCH. No trust = no savers. No savers = no marketcap. No marketcap and the coin gets lost in a sea of shitcoins and can't gain network effect.
