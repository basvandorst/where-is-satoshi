Very much for them. Index funds traditionally charge around 0.0 for ownership and outperform 99.5% of money managers. The reality is, unless you are insanely rich and well connected, you aren't going to ever have someone manage your money that falls into the 0.5% that can outperform the market in addition to covering their 1-2% commission.

Agreed. His repeated promotion of just investing in Index funds has probably done more good for the everyday investor than anything else spouted on investment shows or financial institutions. Let your money work for you, not hand over 2% to someone else over 50 years.

Stock market has been doing this for decades. Every market is a combination of faith and expected profit.

don't forget to include the sales tax when you actually start spending the money you earned after taxes.

Whatever. Like my post said, I ignored it. Didn't really spend time thinking about it. Either way, the famous pizza story was a $50k pizza when he told us about it.

This growth rate is not sustainable in any market. I think people don't realize the US economy is comprised of around $7 trillion in exchanged funds, with holdings exceeding even that. If Bitcoin gets large enough to challenge global currencies, what is to stop the US and any other country from ingraining itself into the bitcoin market as a node and start forming the back ledgers that will link to the blockchain transactions of the bitcoin? We know the IP address that initiates the contract and the IP of those accepting the contract. In doing so, they can begin to regulate the exchanges. This in conjunction to the reforms in Internet laws is going to open the door for this to take a real world hit on how the exchanges work. I think right now is the hay day, and when this becomes enough for global markets to profit, governments will want their piece of the pie they feel is rightfully theirs. Block chain transactions are only anonymous because no one cares enough yet. The exchange rate of the currency isn't enough to even be on the radar of the US.  
I think when that happens and people learn that it is going to be treated like every other currency, it will do two things. It will reduce the market rate growth, probably negatively at first, but it will also stabilize the currency so it can start to globally recognized.

I knew about it in 2008/9 timeframe. Friend was mining them and tried to get us all involved. We said he was crazy. I think they were going for like 5 dollars a coin or something. I ignored it all back then. I honestly am more interested in Block Chain and how it can be employed in other industry use cases, but seems like researching bitcoins is the best way to see some of the things that can be done and how they effected the functionality of the block chain after implementation.
You can easily go to the stock market and pick any number of stocks that grow like a bitcoin did in the past 5 years. Hindsight is always 20/20. You and I probably would have sold long before this. My only hope to cash out would have been if I forgot I had them.
