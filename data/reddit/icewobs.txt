Hahaha see why don't any people in Japan who use reddit do this kind of thing lols.
And you all aren't even in Tokyo so I can't treat you guys to a slice or two.

It's a good start. I want to see it happen a bit more efficiently.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:34:53
As a guy who's been in Tokyo for a while now, this is the truth.
+1 updoots for our friend.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:41:59
Well tell me when you get to Tokyo.

Yes that is the Random Acts of Pizza subreddit. I've offered similar in Japan before (on the subreddit), but warning warning warning I've yet to get anyone to actually do anything for their pizza. Anything - I was only asking for something on the level of a Haiku or a Drawing.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:35:53
Wow good Haiku
Fish sounds tasty
I should make breakfast
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:07:33
Hate to disappoint, but I can only guarantee being here until July 2019.

I don't take pre-orders, but nice try.

What's bread? Also idk anything Osaka, other than a lot of fake ICOs are out there. Be wary.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:37:13
Still opportunity cost loss, but the story might be a good book someday.

Something something tax... something something caught attention of modqueue... something something canary warning in case this says [deleted] soon
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:57:34
Following this, I'd say that I'm just happy that this dog has a nice home, and BTC helped OP to reach her personal happy level with a new companion.
Sounds like a win-win for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:49:55
Always depends on the device.
IBM Thinkpads like the one I'm typing this on, age 12 years (current) and many others are even using 20 year old Thinkpads as daily drivers.
Those Apple computers seem to get bricks thrown at them manually in software updates and will age out of service in like five years from what I hear.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:18:28
I'm a privacy advocate, so I agree he needs say nothing and hear nothing. In fact, OP, I encourage you not to, because the US record has a bad way of using anything said against you.
But I have a right to critically analyse and think about information presented to me. (Well, until modqueue wants it deleted. Thanks for the report, whoever did it.)
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:18:48
Put this way, frankly, I'll agree. (I just hope that the charities won't have to pay as high of taxes on it.)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:44
Sure. It's no accident that I said simple neural networks, not complex ones. The chip is too old to run the last few Mac OS in a virtual machine.
Yes, its market value depreciated. But eventually, if it can age gracefully for more decades, it regains value with amazing strength as a museum piece.
Yet still, you're making the wrong comparison. It is likely I might give up my BTC, in part or whole, at some time. You can give me money, but without putting that computer on a ransom for my family - I will not be releasing it for my entire life - whether that life is long or short.
Good day.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:01:04
It's a classic, but I've been a supporter of it since elementary school when I did the trick-or-treat boxes:
UNICEF should be on the list if they do Bitcoin Donations.
There's also a great end Maternal Neonatal Tetanus (MNT?) that Kiwanis / Key Club sponsors around the world and they've been on their way to making as much history as the Polio eradication effort. I don't know if they have the framework for Bitcoin either, but I think it would be wonderful if either of them could receive your help, so I nominate those two.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:08
In general, changing crypto to fiat is a taxable action in almost every jurisdiction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:48
Don't go buying your VPN with Bitcoin just yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:55:34
I suppose that's the real money. If you're good with people skills, it is always Entrepreneurship that made the most money in the previous many gold rushes, in any part of the world.
Google idea of the day: look up the history of Levi Jeans brand.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:52
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:55:51
Yeah, but these are sometimes the people who make their own successful (not as much as Bitcoin, but still afloat) coins.
I think anyone with enough entrepreneurship and vision can make a successful business out of their visual idea models.
Disclaimer: I have very little of this sense, and have sworn off business creation for the last few years now. I get offers here and then to co-found companies, two of which have some local success (and one which is already bankrupt and failed lols), mostly because I can do some minimal coding and scripting. I'm not getting into it now, and the above should definitely NOT be taken for PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. Seek a licensed business incubator if you're looking into starting your own place/thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:04:23
It's common advice here that those who won't HODL don't HODL.
The best we can all hope for is that when you do reach your own "personal moon" you use it on something that you feel was worth every last BTC.
As an older brother who hopes his BTC will help his younger brother pay for Uni, I stand by your kind brother in solidarity at his very sensible gift giving skills and thank you for your heartwarming story.

Just going to keep playing this on repeat until the sun goes down (it's evening and probably ~1.5 hours to sunset). I like the melody. It's awkwardly soothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:52
We're already getting close enough to 150K on Japanese exchanges, so I expect the Korean ones to be about ten times that - I think 1 BTC is safely over a million korean won by now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:55
I mean, this is a world where people buy stuff on Amazon with little second thought and we need extensions to "put stuff on Ice" for us for a full 24 hours before we make "good purchasing decisions".
I think a few weeks is probably better, but in today's fast-paced world, a few weeks is the difference of a lot of potential fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:20
Ah like when you didn't take advantage of the Bitcoin Gold fork, because you were on Coinbase and had no clue how to manually request your BTG on the blockchain, so you have shadow assets that you don't know how to control and by any legal definition, have forfeited.

Well I use mine every day. I watch videos, do my homework, write reports, and can even run simpler neural network simulations. It runs Windows 10, Fedora, and Ubuntu. I have no complaints with my laptop, but I run it with care and very good specs for a twelve year old computer.
Not every twelve year old computer is still in service, and only some percent boot, but if you're talking to someone who takes care of their devices, try not to sound their death knell.
It's as annoying as those who say Bitcoin must die someday soon.

I imagine there has to be SOME sort of dip after the Segwit 2x show is over later this month, but it's not going back to year-opening under-2000 USD probably for a while.
Quite simply, too many governments are starting to regulate it for us to say "bitcoin is not recognized" currency now (albeit, with humongous risk).
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:08:51
Ice? That's my name :P
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:31
At minimum, a hardware wallet by the time you've exceeded your first 1000USD.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:06:21
Which Mobile wallet are you using right now?
Also, is Blockchain (blockchain.info) a mobile wallet or an exchange? How do I tell?
[Obligatory: Sorry, I'm a newbie. If I knew the answer, I wouldn't be asking.]
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:22:17
Well that was short lived.
But yeah, it is still 9700 for now (thxs Google).
Check back in about 12 hours, and then after the price correction reverses and we're on the rebound again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:51:15
Haha now that sounds like a much better use of that 10% fund. Join the Christmas Exchange on Reddit too, while you are at it, so you can more easily spread the good cheer!
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:09:47
I'd think most open-source QR readers on GitHub that can pass a VirusTotal test would count easily.
Not sure what examples that includes though, sorry :D

In the voice kf an anime fight scene (maybe JoJo's Bizzare Adventure):
"Hahahaha amazing meme skills, celtiberian666."
"But your stand can't beat my NVIDIA 965M!"
"SLI Shaker attack!"

An unprotected one (or one with a key on paper next to it) at that, I guess. Lols.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:36:39
I mean.... it's been legal since April, no?
.... I've got a local cafe owner who's been talking to me since June about setting up his cafe to accept Bitcoin. Hopefully we get it up and running and put him on the maps soon. Could help increase foreign traffic in my area :D
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:37:26
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:08:31
Don't install and try again in a few days.
I'd delete that installer file you downloaded too, lest you get 'curious.'
In short, run for the hills, and keep what you have working already, in good shape.
*Oh, and make sure you have Electrum, not Elctroneum or something else that is some sort of name-phishing. Not that I'm using either, but I'm still learning too.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:18:02
Fair enough, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:42:54
Sounds like Japan. Hi.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:46:46
Just read that :D
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:20:42
Yeah true.
I think Government is a shortcut to that, but let me just add one small thing after living in Japan for a few years now.
It doesn't matter whether or not it's the US Government or any other government. Heck Japan's been embracing this movement for far longer than the US has. If anything, because of the Mt. Gox crash, from what I can understand.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:38:41
And ethereum. For most of Japan, that's still not supported yet! Very cool.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:36:02
Haha thanks. Yeah, I looked at the site for their Android version of that page, I don't use iPhone.
Good advice mate!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:34
It's easier to read as well, but why not both? Paper doesn't cost that much more.
Plus, while "modern hardware" hasn't existed for much longer than the last century, we have metal ruins that get pulled up in archeological digs.
But I'll be darned if I keep my Bitcoin for hundreds of years through multiple generations. I doubt that is a reality for me, but lols.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:43:21
At least its not Korea. It's probs like 7 million won over there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:13:47
I woke up today, had some meetings, did my one class and I learned that my investment in Bitcoin at 7000USD dip actually valued. It's freaking 9710 right now and it's just amazing to me.
Also learned my gamble in pulling half of my resources from BTC to DCR paid off thanks to its rise. It's currently a steady rise at 0.56 BTC for 90DCR where I made the move just 38 hours ago to exchange 0.5BTC and got 90.54DCR.
Overall, a good day for trading.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:13:13
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:14:38
Probably good.
Depends on how it affects the current altcoin rise, likely.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:46:32
I wonder if this is a pending idea between laws and compliance.
Perhaps the Bittrex company is hearing of / just noticed (starting enforcing) KYC laws or perhaps there was many recent exchanges of over 10K USD equivalent (many 1+ BTC transactions) in the last couple of weeks?
That said, I guess hodl on and hope that it gets resolved.
Good luck and when you're out of the woods, use a tiny fraction of that 21BTC to order yourself a hardware wallet plz.
Peace, 73.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:26
Next correction is probably closer to 7000. At best. 8000 at worst.
That's just the nature of most human-traded currency values, and as Bitcoin becomes more popular, it also gains more predictability.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:34:49
Totally unrelated question, but what is the name of the base meme that this is based from?
Is it something like "Cat at Breakfast"?
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:42:23
Hahaha we'll see how well they do this time. Surely, we can expect public acceptance to be slow, at least at first.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:49:06
Technology in Japanese electronics stores is super expensive and has traditionally always been.
I don't see this happening unless the electronics stores really start pricing differently.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:46:42
If you are near Tokyo, there is a Bitcoin meetup group and associated Facebook group you may want to check out as well. To be sure, most of us do it as a fun-time hobby.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:41:49
I think AI is next space race too, but I don't think AI + Cryptocurrency is an impossible battle either.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:05:49
Eh. I don't really bother with mining so idk. Maybe somebody in Akihabara could make a decent priced rig. Again idek anything about mining, but yeah electricity could be a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:50:12
Having lived in both countries, I think the Generation Z in the US is already biting down hard on this.
However, I am in a University full of young Generation Z in Japan and most people I talk to ask "oh I've heard of Bitcoin" but "what is it?"
Not that Japan hasn't made amzing leaps and bounds of changes in 10-year periods. Perhaps 10 years from now, most Japanese University students will have at least 10000 yen (about 100 USD) invested in Bitcoin.
It will be interesting to see.
