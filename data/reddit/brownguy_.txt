Shut up! We know more than him! ^^/s 
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:14:27
Hah, for real. As a crypto holder, I can understand where he is coming from, but people here acting like he doesn't know jackshit is some r/Imverysmart material. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:12:31
Im pretty sure he knows a thing or two about it. "Knows nothing"? Really? Possible the greatest investor doesn't know anything about bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:31:52
Here comes  r/all 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:31:23
What do you mean why? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:24:37
Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:41:39
So, noob here. 
Many people on r/ethereum said ETH was BTC version 2 and said it was superior to BTC. And here, its the opposite. 
I also found many comments here bashing Vitalik Buterin. As an outsider, who's just getting into the crypto currency market can someone ELI5?  I searched online, but failed to understand it.

Fucking paywall!!
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:39:16
Wanted this kinda info for weeks! Finally! Thanks!
I'll run the node for now and start using it once I get to know it better. Thanks again

Okay. I'm a n00b. I don't know what exactly is happening  BTW r/btc and r/bitcoin. I have an idea of what's happening tho. 
I have bitcoins and a raspberry pi. Can someone ELI5 or link articles as to what's happening so that I can be a part of it too? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:01:27
So, am I  the only person subbed to bitcoin  who doesn't own any BTC? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:13:37
This might be stupid, but I've been looking into buying some BTC for about an year ( on and off). How much do you think I should invest?  
Also, I'm a college student and an Indian ( $1=₹63). So, go easy on me. :(

eh, I think demonetization made people to switch to the digital world. even street vendors who make less than 50USD profit per day started online transactions. You may not think this as a big deal. But people here are even afraid to use cards. Dependence on hard cash is very Hugh.

All your savings? no plan B etc? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:54:09
So, activating and running it should do the job?
Sorry if this shound dumb but How will it make my coin, stored in mycelium run on UASF?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:54:26
Bitcoin is the gold standard.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:38:28
Idk, should have waited man...
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:21:35
Blockhain is the future. But do you think BTC /ETC will be relevant in the future?  yeah, I'm grossly uninformed about it. Sorry if this spam! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:02:36
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:33:07
Yes. I use Mycelium. Just wondering if getting a Trezor/Keepkey etc would help. I know its safer. But I've invested only around 500USD.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:05:09
Is it good?
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:20:28
Do you think Wallets like Mycelium are dangerous too?
Also, do you think I should get a tezor? ( I've invested around 500USD. That's all. Will probably invest more with time) 
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:41:04
If it did happen, sorry!  But
Brand new account. I hope you're not fooling and asking for some satoshis from the generous people of r/bitcoin.

It seems they're releasing paid versions in two week. 
Source: Their response on google play. 
They should've developed a paid version already. Improper planning. Smh. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:12:09
Went through their Google Play Store Comments. Ratings went from 4.6 to 3.8( as of now)
They said the app will contain ads for another 2 weeks. By then they'll introduce paid versions.
