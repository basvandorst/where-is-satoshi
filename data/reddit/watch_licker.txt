Same reason people take out a car note when they have 6 figures in the bank account

Being a Walmart cashier is not qualification to comment on how easy creating counterfeit currency is, fam.

Yeah because torturing people for their money is something that's totally going to happen in any first world country.

Goddamn bitcoiners are paranoid

What... do... you...think...ellipses...are
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:17:48
Like every fiat currency in history he says... except almost all fiat still used today.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:29:40
Hey buddy.... why... do you use... so many damn... ellipses...
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:58:43
How about illiterate ellipses.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:28:57
Wasn't the other guys fault
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:21:45
Shove it up your asshole
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:44:49
Yeah but doesn't that go against the whole philosophy behind bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:32:06
I'd bet Venezuelans trade for USD more, and find it a hell of a lot more convenient than BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:36:59
Lmao no?

I don't necessarily think that the mere act of vendors adopting it will spur mass adoption from consumers. Consumers are far more incentivized to use credit cards even if bitcoin were a viable option at every shop - points, consumer protection from fraud, chargebacks if the product or service is not delivered as promised, etc...
Bitcoin must overcome these hurdles if the average Joe should ever "want" to transact with it.
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:35:08
Why would they do that?
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:59:33
From a random bystanders perspective- not a clue what that guy said, but your response is cringeworthy.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:01:44
Then... and then..

Stable demand would mean, say, 200,000 people buy bitcoin on any given day. And that stays constant.
Stable demand growth would mean 200k people buy bitcoin on any given day, and the rate of increase is 2,000 more per day. So tomorrow 202k. The next day 204k. And so on.

What I mean to say is, it seems that one of the oft touted "raison d'etre" for bitcoin is decentralization.
Yet to have what you suggest, it could not be decentralized.
