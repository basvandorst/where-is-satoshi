Central banks aren't designed to make a profit. There's no big conspiracy. In this conspiracy of central banks making massive amounts of money, who are the ones who profit? Janet Yellen? 
To be clear, they do make a profit, but they don't trade speculative assets, and their mandate is not to make money.

Market manipulation is illegal, even for an unregulated asset. I have no clue what institution would charge someone, or how they would find out, but it is technically illegal.

40 minutes now boys. Don't think anyone is out of the woods at the launch though. It will take at least a full trading day for everyone who wants in to get involved. Then, next weeks futures exchange will be even bigger.

Just curious what the sentiment of the subreddit is.

Central Banks don't short things. The only assets they ever hold are bonds.

He's talking about an American bill.

100% agree. Even if you're the most extreme long term holder, at least sell some part of your holdings.

Literally this, even if you look at a one week chart. C'mon man...

There's a wide variety of posts ranging from all sorts of view points. For people curious, they can check out of survey. For people that aren't they can just ignore the survey.

To be fair, the futures were supposed to reduce volatility.

Yeah I'm saying if they missed out on the chance to short and it went up, then they'd be relieved.

Yeah, I wish it let me view more responses without paying. Still, I was surprised at how evenly people responded throughout. In general, 100 sample size gives around a 10% margin of error.

Almost all of the interest in futures was shorting, so if it starts climbing the investors will most likely be happy/indifferent.

Member banks receive a 6% dividend. This dividend does not change.  The fed makes money by lending to banks for more than it borrows for. There is no profit making incentive. There is no speculative buying. The only people that think they are these internet people who believe there's a big money conspiracy in our financial system.

This is hard to watch. Everyone buying bitcoin are regular everyday individuals who keep seeing the price go up. Please, do not put your self in a position where if Bitcoin was worth nothing tomorrow, your life would be ruined.
