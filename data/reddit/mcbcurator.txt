Thanks! If you want, PM me your address, or email it to museumofthecoastalbend and I'll drop something in the mail for you.  If not, that's ok too. We sincerely appreciate the donation.

My guess is since that the only thing this URL contains is the wallet public key, coinbase might be getting confused. The coinbase button generator requires a price, but I don't want to put one in.  If you scan it with a different barcode reader, or copy/paste the wallet code, you should still be able to send us BTC with coinbase though!

Sure, give me just a few minutes to get the web page updated.

Thanks, I was worried I'd done something wrong!  PM me your address (or email us: museumofthecoastalbend and I'll drop something in the mail for you, if you want.  Either way, thanks for the donation! We deeply appreciate it.

Come on down! We've got a variety of interactives up at the moment while we renovate. We'll have all-new exhibits opening February 2014.  But that just means you should visit *twice*! :D

In short, we help visitors explore the last 13,000 years of heritage along the coast of Texas. People have been living here for a very very long time, and we have an active archaeological research unit (volunteers do the excavation).
Our centerpiece is the collection from Ft. St. Louis, the first European settlement in Texas. It was an ill fated French exploration. It didn't work out, but it scared the Spanish into colonizing the area and creating the Hispanic culture we have today. 
We're a small museum with a small staff, but we serve thousands of school kids and adult visitors each year. Maybe bitcoin can help us further our research and education mission!
Edit: Right now at the museum, we're low on actual "museumy" exhibits as we renovate, but we've got a couple fun interactives.  You can throw atlatls outside (they're an ancient spear weapon that the people around here used to hunt), you can built forts and try to knock them down with catapults or 'cannons', and you can see just how small a 17th century colonial ship was, along with artifacts that came from one found in Matagorda Bay.

Thanks. Our director heard about bitcoins and thought they sounded interesting. Then we forgot about it for a couple months, as we are wont to do. Finally got around to making it happen though!
If you're a fellow Texan, we hope to see you wandering down to Victoria sometime in the future.

For admission and small store transactions, we don't anticipate a double spend problem. If you're willing to try it for a pay-what-you-want admission, that's just inexplicable. If you're trying to cheat us out of a shirt or a postcard, you're a big jerk. And I don't think people will honestly do that. If you want to buy a couple hundred dollars of merchandise from us, we'll wait for a confirmation or two first. 
In short, we trust our patrons. We trust them to set our admission fee, and we'll trust them to pay it. So far, that's worked out to our benefit.

It was at Moody Gardens - a combined presentation by the Meadows Center at TX State, and the State Marine Archaeologist. They were talking about the project that just found three wrecks in extremely deep water off the coast ([here's a link to some more information](
We were in the lobby telling people about what we do, like letting them throw atlatls on our lawn.

In honor of our taking bitcoin, we'll mail you some museum stuff (I don't know what yet) if you are among the first to make our brand new wallet feel useful (one person will be *the* first to make it feel useful).
Obviously, you'd have to PM or email me your address to receive said swag in the mail.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:15:24
I have to admit, I'm skeptical that anyone will visit and use BTC. But it doesn't cost us anything to try, and it's pretty cool to say that we're the first.
Also, admission is pay-what-you-want, in case anyone was wondering how many of their hard-earned BTC they would need to spend here.

Oh really? I got it from blockchain. Maybe it's the photo. Here's a link to our website, now with the information there as well.

I'm guessing you're at a large institution.  One thing I *love* about working at a small institution with a very flat org chart is that we can just make things happen - like social media, bitcoin, etc.
We don't yet have a QR code for paypal donations, but I might look into that or something like it.  We have debit/credit at POS, so maybe that's a moot point - it's already easy to donate via fiat, though not over the web for us (I'm working on that too. We're migrating to a new CRM solution that should more easily let us integrate web payments for donations and memberships).
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:42:56
Could you tell me if the QR code at  works for you?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:41:54
At the moment, that is the only sign. And yes, there is a small cost. I had to learn about bitcoin. And it took me a few minutes to make my little sign. It's also taking a little time to train our front desk workers. 
Our current donation demographics don't suggest we'll see much of a conversion of current donations and memberships into bitcoin. I suspect any bitcoin income will be income we didn't have before. And since our admission isn't a fixed fee, I don't see a problem with volatility there.

Cool! We were just up in Galveston at an event teaching people about shipwrecks.
