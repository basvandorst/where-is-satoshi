Thanks.. I put my wallet address into the blockchain.info/ search bar, but still don't see where "public key" is.. Is it labeled as something else? Thanks for the help.

I don't think that's true.. I believe they're two separate entities.. Can anyone else chime in?

The issue is that people just want to invest/mine to obtain the currency. No one wants to really use it and implement it into their spending.

If only we had sidebar full of information and even a subreddit dedicated to beginners. If only.

Didn't stay there for long. As for your question, who the hell knows.

Alright cool. If I wanted to send some out of LBC would you expect it to be faster? I just wanna get my coins outta the exchange.

Sorry I'm a bit of a newcomer, may I PM you some question I have? Or what is the best method to purchase as to get the best 1:1 value? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:59:07
Please elaborate, your response makes me feel like I'm wrong :D

As in, where's the place that I can purchase BTC for the lowest fee?

Is it a good time to invest?

Okay I've done some research but still am not totally unsure of the concept. Basically, GDAX acts as a middleman for a limit order, I post the price I want, and if a seller would like to do so then he accepts my offer?
