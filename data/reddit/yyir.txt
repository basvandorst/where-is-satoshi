I'd take an investment track record of wealth growth over 20+ years over a lucky punt 5 years ago to buy a load of bitcoin. People did really well out of bitcoin, no argument, but to say they are sage visionaries who saw it all coming is mental. People get lucky, happens all the time. Musk had a great idea and is a great business man, he has also had lots of bad ideas that lost. You can't pick 1 data point out of a set to validate your argument.
People like Buffett invest for literally 20/30 years into value companies. It's a totally different investment strategy to get rich quick bitcoin/crypto. Getting rich slowly is almost 100% guaranteed to work, but most people don't want to invest over 30 years to get rich, they want it in 2 months in "the next big thing". 5% YoY in a car spare parts maker is not sexy but in 20 years, you'll be doing alright. Buffett only invests in simple business he understands, like can be explained in 2 or 3 sentences, you cannot explain that with bitcoin. Bitcoin is an asset similar to diamonds, no real value. It's worth what people are willing to pay and that's fine, but it's not a company. You cannot stand up and question the way bitcoin works, or complain to anyone.
All trades have two sides, rich people with bitcoin got rich because someone was willing to pay them for the bitcoin they held. There will always be a loser in any investment, you simply don't usually hear from the guy who lost money. Last point, there will always be people who get lucky or invested at the right time, the trick is not to believe their own hype that it was so obvious.
