Well I only commented because you seemed to have a chip on your shoulder and took  unbiased criticism as a personal attack. But with all honesty, it *is* easier for me to criticize when I have no skin in this game. All of my money is in a more traditional portfolio. 
No hard feeling, I wish you the best of luck with all of your financial endeavors.

Yeah yeah yeah... and MLM companies have policies saying that they cant make income claims. Doesnt mean that isn't the actual motive behind their purchase (or investment, as they see it)
In a perfect world every bitcoin owner is buying in to get rid of fiat currencies, and all of those other reasons that makes crypto great... except that isnt what is happening. Every college aged idiot is buying in *only* as a short term investment.

If most of the people that bought bitcoin, bought it for the sole purpose of flipping, then thats the point of bitcoin. The original idea and purpose of BTC got held down and raped by all of the casuals who used it strictly as a short term investment. 
When all of the casuals leave, will there *really* be enough momentum by the investors/bag holders left to take over fiat currencies?

Sounds like something Eminem would use as lyrics
