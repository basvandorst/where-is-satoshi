I think it's that **it** used to be dorky because tech was inherently "for nerds".

@_date: 2015-08-09 18:03:47
Yeah, and the fear is there because people don't want to die destitute, which wouldn't need to happen if we subsidized people just doing whatever (or inventing new jobs) because their job was no longer necessary.
Or at a broader scale, moving personal allowance (for countries which currently have that) into people's pockets instead of keeping it in the hands of tax authorities, effectively creating an inexpensive, efficient model of basic income.
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:49:37

Documentation and community. That's it.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:02:44
Yes, that's the problem.
We keep artificially supporting jobs that have no right to exist because we're terrified of being called lazy if we admit that we could easily support people doing nothing instead of subsidizing the fake jobs we give them so they won't feel like bad people for not worshipping at the temple of Having A Job.
@_date: 2015-08-21 11:28:34
There's ample competition and you can currently buy much greater things than the pi for similar or less money.
The pi won because it was an education initiative, meaning the documentation for it had to be incredible and that it instantly had a community from day one.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:43:23
Well, now that you started. But at least be writing stuff down as you talk.
Or take notes or something.
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:06:47
And we wouldn't. As documented by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's research in developing countries, the birth rate drastically declines once you secure a certain standard of living because people are no longer reliant on the family unit as a safety net.
So if the worry is overpopulation, eliminating poverty globally is in absolutely everyone's interest.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:52:07
Well, luckily no one is carrying bitcoin.
Keys aren't currency.
@_date: 2015-08-21 14:24:10
Yup. I hope the Pi keeps going more extreme, so that if there's a Pi2 A+ it'll be even less expensive, eventually making a miniature workstation (that you could effectively power off a battery pack) affordable worldwide.
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:29:54
That's the problem in question though. If you ignore people feeling welcome or valuable, you ignore more than half of what makes a community.
And with no community there's a constant risk of Bitcoin remaining a speculation vehicle.

In public they are.
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:48:39

@_date: 2015-08-21 15:42:12
I'm building a distributed systems sandbox to play in, which at the moment is just three nodes, but the Pi fits that use case fantastically because it couples extremely easy installation with affordability.

@_date: 2015-07-02 17:05:54
Yup. The thing is that - like any manual tester job - it's the bottom of the IT sector in that it's unskilled labor. The catch being that you have to be bilingual, good at your native language, and then only targeting that language.
So someone testing French has an English source document, a French translation, and then verifies the translation.
And while I'm not working with it anymore, it's an important kind of UX testing that I really hope people won't try and outsource (or leave to Google). While machines may be able to produce syntactically perfect translations for some languages, decoding tone or "vibe" requires feelings and a cultural identity, two things machines (still) lack.
@_date: 2016-02-21 13:05:25

I'd be very happy to not. I don't come here for humor or market insight, but I wouldn't come here at all if all it was was another stream of the same articles I can find on twitter.

Nah, it's a welcome dip wherein the financially impaired such as myself get to invest heavily in legal file sharing ventures.

Possibly the dumbest time imaginable to sell. Even if you consider the scale of things back then, the 14th was right in a price dip.

I remember the first time I was playing satoshi dice at 5 am. Someone please learn from my mistakes on that one.

I'm aware. But I was still promised some kind of regulatory overlord that needed defeating before Bitcoin became the norm and everyone lived austrianly ever after.
I'm not saying that's sane or it's what I wanted, but it's the determinist idea my joke was inspired by.

Can we get some correction already so I can realistically afford a coin? Stupid popular internet money.

Is there a rule with American news networks that all inquisitive emoting must be in the form of feigned stupidity? If not, why is that a thing?

Okay, looking at Bitcoinity just now, I guess I take that back.

Interac is one of those things I never knew I'd miss about Canada, but actually realize I do. Not being forced to have a credit card to get to not carry hard cash. That's pretty brilliant. Kind of like this other cool idea. Bytepennies or something.

So you're telling me that all my riches will be used for in the future is to verify other people's riches?
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:25:42
My main reason: Having my money be in my own possession without having to keep it on me at all times. That it doesn't depreciate like physical cash is just an added bonus.
I never even considered anonymity so much as lack of external influence, so all in all, yeah definitely, the decentralization is the selling point.

And what's more: Talk of bitcoin millionaires makes me feel poor.

When it hit 900 I was like "now I'll never get to own 10 coins". Now I'm sure I won't even get to own another one.

It's only too expensive if you're expecting massive profits.
If you're buying bitcoin because you agree with the idea, want purely virtual money, or want in for other reasons that are not speculation, it could be worth anything and you would simply adjust your purchases according to what you can afford and what you need.
But I will admit that I know the feeling. Despite knowing that it's worth exactly what I put in just doesn't translate well to emotion when you get like a .9 BTC amount into your wallet.

I don't know but he's right. It's no use crying over spilt investment chances.

I buy worth the same amount in fiat every month, so it's not what I can afford that's the issue here. The issue is that I'm naturally greedy and want ~~value~~ currency for money.

If you're in the EU and your bank supports SEPA for your account type, I'll just plug 
I've been having a great time trading there and it's a bit more stable (and reasonable on the fees) than the private vendors like BitcoinNordic that seem to change by the minute according the the MtGox rates.

I was trying to tone down the hype around Bitcoin as a create-profit-from-nothing machine.
Yes, there's still money to be made by being an early adopter, but if that's the reason you're buying in, you risk getting disappointed.

I'd hedge my bets too if my business model relied on millionaires.
