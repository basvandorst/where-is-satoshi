wire transfers are not processed on weekends and holidays and are not instant or free, are they? (I'm not american)
muforce's strawman did not refute anything either.

the silk road example should be mentioned more often.
plenty of people panic sold and missed out on the subsequent rally to 1200.
even those who hodl'd through the crash afterwards are still up compared to those who panic sold when sr got busted.

this is an excellent example of trying to derail, but I'll feed you:
i doubt many people can afford to troll here 24/7 for months without having to ever go to work.
i don't care if any trolls are getting paid for it or if 100% of you are just dwelling in your mother's basement and doing this because you're insane.
i never said all your posts deserve downvotes, only those in which you are using fallacies or not contributing to the discussion.
**you aren't even on the troll list yet, why are you posting here?**
this shows that you *know* that you are nothing but a fucking troll. if you were serious you wouldn't even care about this thread.

i know you were just trolling but imho a list does help because if trolls can't rely on the karma they built up in and they will have to be a lot more careful about what they post and we get a better sense of how many there are.
remember when someone's karma goes below zero he can only post every 10 minutes.
why should we use transactions to tag them instead of just discussing it in a thread?

is that even possible?
is it possible to write a post talking about the technical aspects of bitcoin that is *not* beneficial/neutral to bitcoin?
apart from the environmental disaster problem I don't really see any real issues.

not if they upvote eachother faster than the community can downvote. it's just a last resort thing.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:14:03
no wait, actually they're making that job obsolete. nvm.

About reporting:
yes, mods are completely inactive but if enough people report a post it will get autoremoved.
that way we can fight against haters who are trying to derail threads by upvoting themselves or hijacking top comments to derail discussions.

except that we now have proof that was right.
and if governments resort to such dirty tricks, why not other institutions too? there are entire wikipedia articles about that and wikipedia is (righteously) incredibly conservative when it comes to conspiracy theories.
thank you, snowden.

funny how the shills downvoted you for this.
