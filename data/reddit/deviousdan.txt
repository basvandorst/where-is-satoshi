As an Aussie I can tell you have no fuckin idea what you're talking about. I handed in 3 guns in the buy back. It was a good decision by our government. You can still get guns here if you want too, so really you have no idea. And Port Arthur was a false flag? You're a fucking imbecile, fuck off cunt.

My mum collects coins, solid gold coins, silver coins and things. I bought her a hard BTC coin in early 2014. It's now the most valuable coin in her collection.

You did well anyways. My mate sold 3/4 of his earlier this year for a deposit on a house. Even thought his 1/4 is now worth more than the 3/4 he sold at he is happy, he has a house. None of us can predict the future, there's no point beating yourself up about it. And always keep *some* bitcoin is a solid strategy too.

I bought at $1200 AUD in 2014. Which was it's high point, so just like OP I was disappointed. And it took like two years to go over what I bought for... But hodling worked, it was just a loooong time before I saw it.

I've migrated away recently for this reason. Not so much mtgox making a mistake but because it manages a tremendous amount of transactions. Bitcoin is fundamentally about distribution.

Then you could go to localparents.com and ask someone to bring some bitcoins with them.

You are talking about a *massive* amount of computing power for this to be insignificantly feasible. I cannot offer you a technical analysis but this is not possible.
I haven't heard of ASIC miners dropping because of difficulty, the majority still need their investment back. They make up a huge portion of the processing power right now.

I'm not familiar with Armory,  but someone else may be able to help you.
I'f recommend proper cold storage though, via booting a clean linux distro and using bitaddress (not brainwallet though) to generate a key.

I had no idea what Quark was until your post. Quark looks like just another alt-coin, but with a minuscule market share. Any reason he endorsed them? There are much better alt-coins presently.

Why did you buy bitcoins in the first place? I honestly believe that anyone who can see the impact bitcoin *can* have on the future aren't interested in short term profits. You can take solace in the fact that one of the very first trades in bitcoin was 2 pizza's for 10,000 BTC.

Not the same but a close call....
My friend was heavily into selling 25i and LSD when SR was large... so for quite a few months he bought reasonable amounts and then sold them on for a profit.
As we were good mates we decided to browse SR one night and i saw his wallet total and all sorts of expletives left my mouth. At the time he had about $3k on there with no idea on security or how the price of bitcoin fluctuated.
I gave him a pretty simple rundown and got him to move them. He would have left them on there otherwise.
Now they are worth 20k+. He thanked me just the other day for getting him to move them so i'm happy about that... so is he lol.

Great post, but it is more technical than a state of community. In regards to the state of the community i think there is a little too much circlejerking going on rather than hard discussion. Just my two mBTC.

Yes the private key is all you need to access the wallet and generate the address. Private keys have a certain format and i'm sure you could make your own but you better make 100% certain it is a valid private key. You can enter your own key in the "Wallet Details" tab on bitaddress.org

Are you planning on spending it? 
If you are speculating with it then cold storage is by far best (and most recommended).
EDIT: The amount of coins doesn't equal a threat at the moment. You could be targeted for any reason. If your computer is already compromised for a botnet it is not much of a stretch for the attacker to keylog bitcoin passwords and wallet data.

I'd hazard a guess that the password for his wallet was the same as his email that was compromised. If that is how it went down...

I was looking for something to buy with my coins instead of just holding. Just placed an order for one! Cheers!! Was totally seamless with coinjar too.
I bought the basic kit with power supply and SD card. Not sure what i'll do with it yet. torrent server maybe... or media for my tv.

I just bought a RaspberryPi with bitcoin for 10% off (for black friday as an Aussie tribute i think?).
I haven't spent my bitcoins for months so i was grinning ear to ear when i found something in Aus that i could buy with bitcoins that i really would like to have. =)

I'm also having the same issue here! No SMS.

With the current trend i'm hoping this doesn't turn into 9001 posts over the next few weeks with all time highs.

Nah, he's not that sorta guy. He would never do that. He loves 25i too so he usually educates people on it anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:24:57
This is your failure here. It was most likely trawled by a bot.
The chances of someone generating the same non-deterministic bitcoin address as yourself is astronomically large, i believe there were calculations that the universe will not even be around for this. But an address generated from a single word  with a set of rules (deterministic, such as brainwallet) can be replicated, even many words and entire sentences.

Deals like this aren't usually made on something that is very probable. They are made on slim chances, just so you know... for future reference... lol
