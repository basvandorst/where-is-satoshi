actually, Google Trends is more like indicator of beginning of the end of bull run. 
* mainstream coverage - check
* Google trend in upswing - check
* another delay decision from SEC expected on 10th Jan to help the crash - check
* fits with bubble timing - check
whale advice: wait couple days for people to transfer funds and have time to buy then crash. 
I love bitcoin but i give this bull run 1 more week tops. advice for newcomers: wait after the bubble crash, it will still go below 900 for short while

Its all in one development package. 21 with partners is planning to put the similar chips inside smart devices. These devices will have APIs and will be able to send or receive payment or just change its status on the blockchain. This computer is a prototype of such device and if you have an idea how authenticated devices comunicating between themself might be useful you can actually start to program it with this.
