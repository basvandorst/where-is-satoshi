Oh no, you keep the foundation so you can classify the blackjack and hookers as "fundraising".

Don't forget having their lobbyists push Congress and the Senate to legislate against bitcoin.

Good point, but I don't think they could kill it entirely, but they could make is difficult to buy, own, and use.

Lambo is just a metaphor for what makes you happy, for you it's a new lawnmower and eventually a new sprinkler system.  It's different for everyone, it's what ever makes you happy.
BTW I sold in December to pay off my credit card debt, my "lambo", and a few people gave me grief for not holding longer.  Focus on the fact that selling gave you the ability to buy or do something that makes you happy, and no matter what the price is later on if selling now allowed you to be happy then you sold at the right time.

Never, it's never not a cover for free money.

Been done, now if the IRS catches you using a church as a cover, they come down on you pretty hard.  Plus they investigate fraudulent churches like crazy now.  A nonprofit is still the safest way to go if you ask me.

I get what you're saying but I think it was more about aiding the enemy.  I'd bet the kid wasn't really telling them anything they didn't already know, but it's the idea.

Google "bitcoin ATM" if there is one near you then you should be able to deposit cash and have it loaded into your mobile wallet.

Just added that book to my reading list, thank you.

This time last year I sold and paid off my credit card debt, it took me three weeks to convince myself to sell but a year later I'm so happy I did.  I still believe in BTC and continue to buy in small amounts, but that one sale at the $18,000 mark changed my life and I don't regret a thing.

Or you know... Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:08:45
Wow, didn't even know this was a thing.  Great idea to help newbies get into bitcoin!

I know I just thought since we were in a Bitcoin sub someone should suggest it.

So basically this is aimed at Snowden &amp; Wikileaks.

It's not that they didn't like what he was saying, the government look's the other way when it comes to things they don't like all the time, it's the fact that what this kid was saying was meant to aid the enemy that got him in trouble.  He could have wrote about demanding sharia law in the US and wouldn't have been arrested, he would have been put on a watch list, but he wouldn't have been arrested.

Freedom of speech does have limits, you can't yell fire in a crowd and be covered by freedom of speech.

Thanks.  I thought I was reading the correctly.  I am not a smart man...

Came here to say this.

Well when they've publicly stated that they want destroy the United States, and have brutally murdered several American citizens, I'd say we're at war with them.  Though I do agree there should be a Congressional vote on the matter.

Maybe you could share a link to said internet print shop?

When it comes to the bitcoin CEO all that needs be said is, the bitcoin king is dead, long live the bitcoin king.

Ah yes, I remember her speech on the devaluation of the dollar against the pound sterling back in March of 2011, had the room riveted.
