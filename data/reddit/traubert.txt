Has anyone lost bitcoins through generating a cold wallet on a compromised computer? I booted into a usb stick to be extra safe, but even that felt overcautious tbh.

I think there's also just the benefit of bitcoin as a backup system. The conventional financial system is stable at the moment, but it isn't invulnerable. I can see a lot of value in having alternate systems actively developed and in place.

There was a debt bubble first that pushed asset prices up. Much of the monetary inflation has happened to soften the crash from that. But even this amount of monetary inflation hasn't been enough - money got sucked into the debt hole so fast during deleveraging that price inflation has persistently been low.

Kind of depends on your geographical location. If you were in Europe, SEPA transfers are a very convenient way to get btc.

It's not progressive propaganda that the public sector as a percentage of GDP is, on average, larger in Europe than it is in the US, though.

You probably won't be able to profit from mining if you don't really know what you're doing. If you do know what you're doing, you need to invest money into it first.

I was happier when it was hanging stable between $5.00 and $5.20. This is just going to end up with a bubble that pops, and much disappointment.
@_date: 2012-12-03 10:04:34


True, and point well made, but the fact remains that for a long time Europe has been (and continues to be) more public-spendy than the US, which would cause most people to place it to the left of the US. You can disagree with that placement, but you're in the minority.

Ah, too bad. Thanks for letting me know.

You need the private key - keep that on paper, a usb key, a hard drive, whatever. A private key is what entitles someone to spend coins. If you have the only copy of the private key, that's the only point of failure.
Currently, your coins are with an address handled by Mt. Gox, and your code (do they have expiry times?) entitle the holder to receive coins from Mt. Gox. It's like a cheque at a bank.
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:02:05
No, it's not like that. There's just one fee for the whole transaction. But the size of the fee you'll have to pay depends on various things, especially the size of the transaction.
Some of the things concern clients and the transactions they're willing to relay (like the limitation we're currently discussing). These things can be changed by just configuring clients to work differently. Some of them concern miners, and the fact that they have a limited amount of space in each block and want higher fees for larger transactions. This is more of an economic reality.
Your client will try to minimize the fees you have to pay, but if all the inputs are tiny, you'll probably have to pay a fee that seems rather large in proportion to the amount you're sending - but it's still possible to send it.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:03:02
You can buy and spend even quite small amounts of bitcoin. Don't fixate on the price of 1 bitcoin. Think about the price of smaller denominations, if that makes it easier. You can get in the ground floor of $0.25 bitcents, or 2.5 cent mBTC, or 0.000025 cent satoshis. The only thing you need to worry about are fixed fees, but there are ways to not incur any.
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:37:02
There are many ways to do it. Some people just print out one address / private key and send everything to it. I printed several, wrote bitcoin amounts on them and funded them accordingly.
It doesn't need to be reprinted if more money is sent to it. If you spend from it, you're going to have to type or scan the private key into something, so it would be natural to spend the entire amount into a non-paper wallet ("sweep all transactions") and get rid of the paper wallet / never use it again. "Sweep all transactions" is an instruction to a bitcoin client to walk through the blockchain, look for transactions to your address, and spend them to another one.
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:26:24
You wouldn't normally sign a message to accompany a transaction. Once you've sent bitcoins that's it. A use case could be something like "I am Traubert and confirm that I am holding the 200 BTC at this address in escrow pending the resolution of a bet between kbinferno and gox on the price of fish in Calcutta."

Conceivably one day when bitcoin has moved to another encryption scheme due to the old ones not being strong enough, lost bitcoins will start getting reclaimed by people cracking the private keys.

My sympathies.

There had been several delays since I'd ordered, and I was losing confidence both in BFL and in my own desire to mine. I figured that since they'd just announced additional delays, they might be willing to give me a refund.
@_date: 2013-02-19 08:01:24
I think this is actually a threat to bitcoin. Resentment that a bunch of cryptogeeks expect to make a fortune and have "an empire" for essentially just holding bitcoin is already a barrier to adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:45:18
I don't see how that's true. If nodes start accepting blocks with higher block rewards, then a chain with higher block rewards becomes the longest chain.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:35:04
When you spend that, you'll generate a large transaction, because there are so many inputs. Large transactions mean large fees. Sorry. Maybe one day it'll be possible to bring fees down, and limits like this won't be needed, but currently it's necessary to limit bloat in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:50:49
Yes, bitcoin mining hasn't been for beginners for some time now.

You're relying on both your printout being secure, and Mt. Gox being secure. It's better to minimize the number of points of failure.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:57:00
Once you empty them out, it doesn't matter if you lose them.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:38:37
Seconded. Best to keep the paper wallet in a number of addresses so you can import one and leave the rest, minimum of hassle.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:02:48


This isn't what you think it is. Those percentages refer to the probability the diceroll has to beat.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:57:47
Why not. I think the encrypted wallet feature in bitcoin-qt is security enough, so my backups are just regular copies of the encrypted wallet.
Of course, then there's the question of keeping your passwords secure and unloseable...
@_date: 2013-03-03 22:25:49


I don't know is this really so convenient. The only way I can see this working is if you want to buy something that costs the exact amount of money you've transferred to the address. For most uses it's definitely better to make payments off your own device.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:19:47
Terrible circlejerky idea.
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:59:34


Yes. The wallet essentially contains a bunch of pairs of public and private addresses. The public address you tell people to send bitcoins to, the private keys are what you need to send the coins to another public address.


You usually get a trading account. They show your balance in USD or whatever, and bitcoin. You can make withdrawals with either. So you can deposit USD, buy bitcoin, withdraw bitcoin to an address of your choosing.


You have to trust the exchange in all the cases I can think of. Though I've never heard of the well-known exchanges engaging in fraud, and they process quite a lot of money at this point.


It means that you do an operation to a message with a private key that proves to other people that you must have had the private key associated with a particular public key. They still won't be able to figure out your private key.


I don't know about this. Maybe some way to make you reveal the private key?


Backing up a wallet means backing up the keys. That's about it. It can be as simple as making a copy of the wallet file, though if you export it via a client, the client might eg. make sure that the exported wallet already knows about the next 100 keypairs that are going to be generated. That way, if you receive another 30 transactions and then lose your original wallet, the backup wallet will still have access to those funds.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:44:31
Yeah, the limits would change is the network started using different rules. It's enforced by active network nodes, basically.

As for 1), it's really not that hard to find a secure way to keep keys (or several secure ways and split your bitcoins between them) - and to then instruct your family how to access them.
As for the rest, you're kind of right, but there's really no way to get to a better future without a phase like this first.
@_date: 2013-02-20 09:34:34
I don't think the tax thing is such a huge issue. Cash is already more untraceable than bitcoin. Tax authorities do spot checks on employers, control land and property deeds, control car registration, etc. Bitcoin won't help people subvert those taxes much.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:40:39
That should be possible, yes. There are also other tools to dump the private addresses from the wallet. But you should try replacing the empty wallet with your old one. As long as you keep a copy of the old one safe, you're not risking anything.
@_date: 2013-02-12 10:16:43


If bitcoin tanks, you're going to cash out? I'll be cashing in...
@_date: 2013-10-19 07:16:17
Hey, here's a question - where can I see your deposit / withdrawal options and fees? Also, give me gold!
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:38:26
Multiple places, so that my losses are limited if anything goes wrong with one of them. Two accounts in exchanges, two local wallets (computer and phone, both backed up) and a cold storage paper wallet.
Basically, online storage in an exchange is completely reliant on the security and general reliability of the people running the exchange. They're probably better at it than you are, but they're attacked more than you as well.
@_date: 2013-02-11 12:30:53
I ordered from BFL with bitcoin, requested a refund at some point and was promptly given one (though for the dollar amount at time of ordering).
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:45:03
To some extent, yes. A good number of nodes means that transactions get propagated quickly, and that any funny business with modified nodes bad guys try to do is less likely to succeed, because there's an ocean of nodes running with unmodified rules.
That said, miners are the main controllers of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:38:39
Quite significant error early on: the video claims that a large number of miners keeps transactions being validated smoothly. 
In reality, not a lot of computing power is required to validate transactions, it's finding new blocks that's resource-intensive - and that in turn isn't made any smoother by having more computing power, but more secure.
@_date: 2013-02-15 07:30:49
Very interesting, and an unpleasant situation. Of course, some people might be able to acquire bitcoin by eg. offering their services over the Internet, or selling their own stuff through the mail.
@_date: 2013-02-13 06:43:12
If I had some insight into how likely you'd (be able to) pay me back, I could do this. That's why we need middlemen, I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:24:33
Well, maybe if it's one lump of the exact same size. But I don't think there's any reason to absolutely have to keep hundreds of addresses around. If parts from each end up in different parts of bigger sums, that's still pretty well mixed.
@_date: 2013-02-11 14:26:47
Yeah, I basically ended up losing on the whole thing because of this, as if I'd sold bitcoin low and bought high. But not very much. I think it was due to the reason krillcoin mentioned, they weren't holding it in bitcoin and didn't want to take the loss themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:35:27
This is an interesting question - as far as I know, we don't.
@_date: 2013-02-19 12:26:56
Yeah, that ain't the dream for me, and I doubt it's going to play out that way. Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme won't have a long life, but as an alternative monetary system it might.

I trade in USD on Bitstamp because that's the currency they use. I'm in Europe and so is Bitstamp. It's just somehow become the convention.

Cornering the bitcoin mining market like that could be like killing the goose.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:08:42
You can't really use them like regular banknotes, no. If I received a paper wallet from someone, I'd immediately spend it to an address I've created.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:51:44
I'm not sure do I want the block size to be increased. A limited block size is really the only solution I know of to the tragedy of the commons problem when there are no more block rewards (forcing people to compete to get included in the blockchain with fees).
@_date: 2013-02-15 07:35:17
If everyone only did what a lot of people do do, ie. hoard bitcoin in the hope of appreciation, then it really would be something like a distributed accidental pyramid scheme. But it has legitimate uses other than use as a token for hoarding.
@_date: 2013-02-19 20:13:30
Those comparisons are a bit flawed. Paypal founders made money off fees, an explicit service charge. If people buy bitcoin for utility, no problem - but many are buying in hope of appreciation. If everyone does that, it's a pyramid scheme.
Don't get me wrong, I think bitcoin *is* delivering value, I'm a big bitcoin fan and own (for me) a lot of bitcoins. I just think the "we're going to own entire city blocks in the future because we hung out on the Internet and bought a couple of bitcoins" attitude is both bad for bitcoin utility (because it's passive) and bad for bitcoin adoption (because it's the pyramid scheme aspect).
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:26:59
I think Bitstamp will do business with you without having a scan of your ID. They're awesome for Europeans who get fast and free SEPA deposits (if I want coins, I can get them in 24 business hours for a total of 0.5% in fees), but they take international wire transfers too.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:13:16
I accidentally double-paid for something with Bitpay. I contacted them and was refunded in something like 5 minutes. They didn't need to clear anything with anyone.

Relating to security: I'm no cryptography expert, but the code specific to eg. verifying blocks and transactions is very clear and easy to understand. If there's a back door, it's cleverly hidden (perhaps this goes without saying anyway..).
But there's a meta-point in bitcoin: we definitely have a blockchain. Nobody can take that away. If a back door is discovered, it can be fixed and whatever catastrophe happened in the meantime could plausibly be undone by going back to the state of affairs of a good block. It's also very public. If it's subverted, it'll be very obvious.
Relating to mining: not only chip manufacturers, but any number of powerful entities could perform a 51% attack at this point. There's getting away from that. They could destroy the network, but I don't think they'd profit from it, because bitcoin would die at that point.
As for whether they could profit from it by just mining - sure, if they thought it was worth their while. I think the bitcoin community would welcome with open arms such prestigious companies coming to help with the task of verifying transactions securely.
Relating for hoarding, it's not a problem per se. As long as there's *some* real activity going on, the hoarding isn't going to drown it out. I think the main problem from hoarding is bad PR and resentment against people who hope to get obscenely rich without contributing anything. I'm not a fan of the phenomenon, but there's not much to be done about it, and the worst that can happen is some dorks getting rich. Big deal.
I'm also personally somewhat guilty of hoarding. I've been buying bitcoins from about when they went for $5 up until recent times, and hold quite a few. I've also spent quite a few. I'm a fan of the system, but it's not my crazy retirement plan.
edit: oh, and I think this sort of critical post is very welcome in these exuberant times.

I think with Bitstamp you can do this. If they get a SEPA transfer for the correct amount that you've told them you'll be depositing, and it has a message with a code they gave you, your account will be credited.
