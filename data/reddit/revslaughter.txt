This is what I wanted to say, so I'll add some detail for `dd` is *nix's utility for copying data out of files. In *nix environments, hardware is abstracted by files, so what you could do is see where your USB drive 'is'. Say it's at `/dev/sdd` (you'll have to check, try `sudo fdisk -l` or `sudo mount -a`)
Then if this CD is hosted somewhere as an image or an iso file (say an iso) then you'll have that downloaded on your main computer somewhere, suppose it's at /home/ed19/Downloads/paperOS.iso
Then you can copy the .iso directly over everything else on your USB drive. I would use a thumbdrive. This will delete everything on your disk, so back it up if it's important before you start. Also be extra super sure that /dev/sdd is really actually very much where your USB drive is. If you get that wrong, you *will* delete another harddrive. Entirely. So don't be only kinda sure. Be extra deluxe sure.
Once you're certain you know what to do, then:
    sudo dd if=/home/ed19/Downloads/paperOS.iso of=/dev/sdd/
This will write every byte from the iso file directly on top of everything on your USB drive, making your USB drive behave exactly the same as a CD. You can do this with pretty much any CD (though some check to see if they are 'really' cd's -- looking at you windows installer disc) but for every linux liveCD I've tried it's been fine.
Just take the USB disc to your internet-disconnected computer and plug it in, boot from it, and "you're in"! Whee.

Seems like a pretty shady motherfucker...
