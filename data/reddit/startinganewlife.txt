I agree. People keep repeating about the futures expiring tomorrow. What's up with that? Do the futures expire every day?

If he has the seed, then he can lose his USB key too and restore from seed. I still don't see how a hardware ledger nano is different from a USB key in that matter.

I can use the same with a USB key.

It isn't necessarily, but if tether falls, Bitfinex will probably fall with it and it may result in something similar that happened with Mt. Gox. Bitcoin price may fall hard if Bitfinex closes and refuses to pay customers.
I'm not saying I want this to happen or whatever, I am pro-bitcoin, but this is one of a few possibilities.

So far in 2018 it looks like at least four nations will be maintaining some portion of reserves in bitcoin. This is the beginning of the gargantuan national wealth adoption phase with trillions to flow in. The money involved is astronomical. The flood is coming.

This is amazing!

Down the digital drain, probably.

And ledger nano is unlosable or what? They can lose it just the same way they can lose their USB key. Your point is invalid.

As far as I know, it's just because tether was asked multiple times to do an audit and they refused (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
Also, so many new tethers are released into circulation too often, so people doubt they are really backed by fiat.

Yeah, I was wondering about that. At first I thought it was just a strange way to call out "EU", but then I have no idea what Robinhood is, so I wasn't sure about anything anymore. Forget I said anything.
EDIT: I still don't see how "most people can't even use it," or how that even matters anyway. Some people can surely use it. If OP can't, it's no reason to tell others to stop talking about it.

I've read your post with the intention to answer your question, but then I realized that there is no question.
What are you asking?

~~So you're saying most people don't live in EU, Canada and Australia combined? That's a bold statement.~~ Forget it, I'm retarded.

I can probably help you.
I'm successfully trading with my own bots myself (no arbitrage though, I don't like to go that path for various reasons I will not disclose, but I don't mind helping you).
PM me with details, if you want, and maybe we can do something.
