I think people are looking at bitcoin like an investment and will flock to the place with the highest reputation in order to store their coins. People would run to banks in droves, not wanting to have the trouble of securing their own finances.

To spread the word, to be able to store your money in a non government controlled space. To be able to approach local businesses and talk to them about bitcoin. 
To participate in what they believe in. Your astronomy bit is kind of a joke, no astronomer owns galaxies, further, owning a galaxy isn;t the requirement to participate in the study of astronomy. 
A better thing to say is "I'm interested in astronomy but I am not an astronomer." Which is also over-simplified because I would reply as such.

Did you know that 80% of people who live in urban areas are living in poverty? Earth is a world of slums, largely spurred on by government exploitation, look into minimum wages being kept low in third world counties. Look into governments putting their countries into debt to companies. 
People don't like being poor, the technology allows them to subvert their governments and participate in a decentralized, globalized space.

Bitcoin cannot split, the amount you have is the amount you will have until you buy more or sell. Think of bitcoin like your national currency.

I was having the same problem and my funds seem to be all there, what was weird is that previously confirmed funds unconfirmed themselves.

That's a fair point. I guess because a conventional "store of wealth" like gold or real estate isn't traded between people as often as a any amount of currency... in my eyes anyway.

We have to balance decentralization vs fees, I think I can stomach a little less decentralization for lower fees. I dunno I'm just throwing things out there, what do you think?

He is not acknowledging that 200kwh per transaction is an insane amount of energy. He isn't detailing any actual solutions to make less the energy required, hell he didn't even talk about the LN which is being touted as a fix. 
Instead he spouted that companies don't build transmission lines when building multi billion dollar projects and what you pointed out.

I had the same issue, make sure your wallets and everything are up to date and... wait it out, a low fee tx will eventually get rejected by all miners and the tx will get wiped from the blockchain, all coins will arrive to their rightful place in about a week

extrapolate, as a rule they sell asap. If it crashed two years ago they would have lost money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:51
That's what I'm saying. I believe the dream of currency is dead this very second, the price surge is speculation as a "store of wealth". 
When people realize it won't go up forever they will panic sell, I sus a huge drop in the next year. Unless we can shift the public perceptions of what bitcoin was made to do. Not just a store of wealth but a decentralized currency.
What do you think?

I am having a very similar problem, I tried to move funds out of my wallet and now 36 hours later there is no transaction ID and previous funds that were once confirmed are now unconfirmed. 
Hopefully this isn't serious and will be solved soon.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:57:44
He talks about having the inability to transport power from one place to another but this doesn't happen. If you were building lets say [the Site-C dam in BC]( you would build the transmission lines FIRST, never would you be creating power with nowhere for it to go. This undermines his core argument highlighted at 1:48

I sent a similar amount and with similar fees, I waited and waited for like a week with no change. What I learned is this, if the fee is too low, miners will reject the transaction and all funds will return to their rightful place. The time inbetween sending a low fee transaction and having your funds return is about 6-8 days. 
You just gotta wait! I use a different wallet but check if you can update software on your nano (I don't know if this is a thing). I have confidence that your funds will return to your wallet in the next couple days.

Water is a collection of H2O molecules you nit witted fuckass. You can't combine 'Water' (a collection of things) and 'a molecule'. Water is not just three atoms, a water molecule is. Water is a bunch of water molecules that individually are made up of three atoms.
