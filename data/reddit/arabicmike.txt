why did you move LTC and ETH to BTC?

I wish she'd pushed him harder. She kinda looks like she's about to cry as he's trashing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:05
What is internet. Anyone know what internet is?

A 10 min meditation has become 10 mins of thinking about bitcoin ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:50:20
I'm familiar with MtGox - it's just technically if banks weren't virtually invincible from going bust, it would be the same thing, right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:46
i'm beginning to think BTC doesn't do corrections anymore
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:28
buy both ledger and trezor. Put 1/3 on Ledger 1/3 on trezor and 1/3 on paper. Paranoid? Maybe but good for peace of mind. This whole BTC thing must be stressful if you have a lot!
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:55:56
Wasn't aware of that... that is strange. So you could never put it into cold storage?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:42
I hope you're right but I am not sure you are.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:42
thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:35
Does prepare mean HODL?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:10:54
not true
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:26:59
1hr and 12k will be a reality. It's already Monday morning in the far east and fiat is flowing in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:51
buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:41:31
just hodl m8
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:49:11
A traditional gold lover. She however is def a HODLer.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:30:49
we're part of something special guys
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:39:11
The only outcome is for BTC (aka Digital Gold) to shoot up as money floods into something which has true value and a limited supply. Right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:34:30
Many people heard about bitcoin several years ago. 
Only a small handful of those committed the time and energy into really grasping the concept and fully understanding it.
Only a small handful of those people were passionate enough about bitcoin to hodl through the ups and downs of the last couple of years.
I respect and admire those who got in early and who pioneered this technology.
I am also grateful to be part of it in 2017, a time which I personally believe is still 'early'.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:47:24
I think it was Naval Ravikant who with Tim Ferriss once described Bitcoin as 'criminal futures'. I 20% understand what he meant by this.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:38:34
I respect Roger's passion. He is however unstable and therefore difficult to trust or take seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:28
yes we do.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:25:54
I've said it before and i'll say it again. The next 'dip' might be considerably higher than the current ATH!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:56:55
As trust in these exchanges builds - say reputable and established banks allow you to store and exchange cryptos, as Revolut currently is - would that change anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:11
I just can't believe i've never seen this before.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:18:13
Either but will become more volatile as people can bet on shorting BTC. This is as I understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:39:56
investment vehicles failing would cause a reduction in one's net worth but it's not like because your stocks fall in value by 50% all of a sudden you are in debt
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:55:29
Ok so are you familiar with Revolut? A modern banking app which allows you to convert pretty much any currency to any other at the mid-rate. Revolut has plans to roll out BTC exchanges within their app. They are in the process of applying for a European bank licence. I imagine a world where high street banks and online banks like Revolut have a mixture of fiat and cryptos for the user to freely exchange as and when. My question is - if reputable and regulated established banks like the ones you keep your $ in allow you to hold BTC with them, in the same way we store our $ with them - would that change anything?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:38
I'm not buying in all this crazy hype that's for sure. It might not come down as far as 10 but my prediction is we'd see 12 again before we see 14... could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:32:25
when I realised $10k was the new base I was sad not to be able to buy at under $10k.
Good job I can still now get in an under £10k!! And that, I will.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:38
might be just cos I am glued to reddit but I feel like i'm witnessing history right now. Front page news tomorrow it has to be!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:27:08
and HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:56
tis indeed ol' boy!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:30
hope it goes to 8k
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:57:57
Fair point. I just reckon if/when cryptos go mainstream the whole process is gonna have to become a whole lot more simple for the masses to adopt. Maybe there would be crypto 'banks' I think of exchanges as like a bank - they hold your coins for you as banks hold your cash. Surely we will at some point have to trust someone or something with our cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:38:59
wtf tho seriously...
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:02:33
or the present...
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:55
I was actually also thinking of IOTA. Seems to be one of the few you can trade IOTA in. Do you know of any other exchanges you can hold IOTA? Or do you know if you can hold IOTA offline in cold storage yet?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:17:50
I ask every cashier 'do you take bitcoin?'. I think if every HODLer did this we'd see hyperbitcoinization.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:26:22
This was overall incredibly positive for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:27
It's tumbling. Why?
