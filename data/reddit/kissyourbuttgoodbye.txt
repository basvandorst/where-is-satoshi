You mistake the point.  The price of gas is *a price*.  And therefore must be included in the inflation statistics for them to have any correlation with real conditions.


That "random" crash was due to the recession.  Which would cause - as it did - a large deflationary pressure due to credit contraction.


Food inflation rates are easy to hide.  Smaller portions, formulation modifications for processed foods, and so forth can all cause the general government data to be utterly misleading.


"Leaving money sitting around" is how economies grow - via investing.  I save money in the bank, and the bank loans it out.  I get some interest, the bank gets a cut, and business gets just enough loans to have sustainable growth.  That's all prevented by inflation - moderate or not.
"Moderate" inflation causes the boom-bust cycle.  We'd be far better off without that.


Oh, no!  People will never buy anything with it then!  Just like no one buys computers because the same amount of money will get you a faster, more powerful, and more useful one next year!


That's not even the case.  But yes, your *life savings* should be fairly well protected.  Cold storage is far easier to manage than getting a bank vault to protect cash, anyway.  And there is no reason that one cannot set up a "bitcoin bank" wherein you pay for someone else to store it, or possibly let them loan it out as with a CD.  (Just because fractional reserve banking is not possible does not mean that loans are not....)

All banks charge merchants for ACH withdrawals.  Just like all credit card companies charge them fees.  Just because *you* don't see the charge, doesn't mean it is free.

They have no such shared interest.  This is why collusion always fails.  The interest is in undercutting the other firms, so as to obtain an actual market price, as the market price provides optimum profits and undercutting increases market share.

If you've seen the size of my media collection, you'd realize that this is actually irrelevant.


No, I am betting that an attacker cannot guess which sentence from even all of the literature, film, etc. I have seen would be the pass phrase.  Because there are all the unknowns involved:
* What type of media: film, book, video game, etc.?
* How long of a phrase was taken?
* How was it manipulated?  Sure, a few letter-number substitutions is simple, but what if I, say, sent it through a hash first? Or some other encryption algorithm?
Basically, my point is this: you can take a pass phrase that is a quote from some media and make it just as difficult to get the private key from that as getting the public key from the Bitcoin address.

Most of our oil imports come from non-OPEC countries.  Mainly Canada.  Another large chunk - around 50% - is domestic production.  This myth that OPEC controls the price of oil (and therefore gas) needs to die.


Right, so let's exclude anything that changes dramatically.  Oh, look - inflation is "moderate".  You really don't see how that matters?


They are not generally.  A tub of butter is included as a tub of butter.  The fact that a tub of butter is now some amount smaller than it was in 2004 is not factored in at all.


It is impossible to do this without shoving it in your mattress.  Further, if there is incentive to let it "sit around", you gain far more from saving it in a bank or lending it out in other ways.


Sure. But why on Earth would making people that save experience a loss - a loss not recoverable via sane methods of investing - be a *good* thing?


The bankers as a class are vilified because they operate fractional reserve systems that extract the interest from savers, and because they are *above the law*.  The actual operation of a bank - securing your instant-access deposits and loaning out the money you loan to them (CDs, etc.) - is not a problem.


I didn't say it would.  On the other hand, there is much reason to believe that wealth distribution would be helped by *not sabotaging every possible avenue for the poor to save*.  Yeah, that "moderate" inflation causing the "2-3% loss" that you **are promoting** - that is keeping the poor where they are.


That's just not the case.  The people that own the most bitcoin are generally computer geeks that got into it back in 2009 or 2010 (or earlier), not bankers.  For the most part, any bankers that support Bitcoin are recently aware of it.


So what?  The people that stood the most to gain from computer tech were not the programmers in the last decade, but visionaries like Bill Gates and his contemporaries.  Does that mean that being a computer programmer now is a bad idea?
This smacks of envy, not rationality.  "Who gains the most" is irrelevant to the questions of "will this help the poor", or even "is this better for the economy".


You speak as if a 50x return is not a good one, when we live in a world where you get 1.001x return on your normal savings and *maybe* a 1.05x return on investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in the long term.

Yep.  Canada is totally colluding with Venezuela.  Clearly.  How could I not see it before?  Except for the fact that every single non-OPEC producer operates in a market where they would benefit by "cheating" on any possible collusion that occurred, should it occur in the first place.


Sure, sure.  T-mobile is just offering to buy you out of your contract  with the other guys because they colluded with those guys.  It couldn't possibly be that they stand to make money from increasing their customer base, and are willing to essentially pay to do that.


That happens when you hold to your position in spite of all evidence.  OPEC imports constitute about 25% of oil used in America, but they somehow set the price unilaterally.  Sure. Based on your position there, and your refusal to face facts, I'm not inclined to believe your analysis of Bitcoin markets to be sensible.

He's right.  It really doesn't matter.  The business is there to make money.  If it is losing out on that opportunity because it doesn't take Bitcoin, how the people that refused to eat there were acting is irrelevant.

You still aren't getting it.  You are assuming a vast quantity of information is already in the hands of the attacker, or at least guessed accurately.


Not really.  A randomly generated pass phrase is not actually safer.  That's my entire point.  A phrase of unknown length selected from unknown media or made up on the spot is *just as safe* as any randomly selected pass phrase of known length, even if you use the entire English dictionary (which is highly unlikely).  The only case that is not so is if you can narrow down selection parameters - and the only way that can be done by an unknown attacker (as opposed to a phishing attack) is to make *guesses*.
I would actually bet that an electrum seed would be hit by a search through 3-8 letter words in the dictionary faster than a pass phrase I selected intentionally.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:53:15


Because you are no longer dealing with characters or the entire set of English words, but with limited dictionary entries.  But this only matters **if they have access to the dictionary and know which one to use**.  Which basically amounts to saying "the code is easy to crack if you already know the code".


You still fail to understand entropy as it relates to information theory, and thus to cryptography.  The only reduction in entropy is if *the attacker* knows which films I've seen and stick in my mind.  (Must know me pretty well for all that.)  In that case, **and only that case**, he can use a limited dictionary attack.  In any other case, he's still having to brute force an unknown number of English words.  Sure, if you pick "Use the force, Luke", someone is going to probably just *guess* (not crack) that.  But something far less ubiquitous.... like opening a book you like to a page and selecting a sentence off that page.... like, say, "Two of the crucial problems of production theory are the method by which the monetary income is allocated and the corollary problem of the pricing of the factors of production."  (Bonus points if you recognize that book.)  That's not something that someone would crack easily.  But it's something that, even if I had to remind myself, I could do so without even giving the sentence away (unless someone knew my shorthand reminder code, itself simply a series of letters and numbers.)

Even if that ends up being the case (and it would take a very long time), this just means that everyone using it gains value by saving, instead of losing it.  Why would this be a bad thing?
And even if someone gets in later, they still can't lose value - they just don't gain *as much*.  *shrug

There is an SHA256 hash that you can try cracking.  I'll even let you know that it is from a fairly popular TV show from this century (2000+).  That is far more than any attacker would know unless they had already compromised it due to other information I provided unintentionally.  (And even then, they'd probably be guessing, not cracking it!)  Have at it!  (Just for the record, this sentence hash has 243.9 bits of entropy.  Unhashed, the pass phrase has 474.1 bits of entropy.

No such thing exists in economics. "Better" can only mean "whatever wins out in the market"... which won't be an inflationary option.


The logic that says deflation is bad for our economy depends on people "hoarding" (i.e. refusing to spend) because their money gains in value constantly is clearly wrong.  The very same logic implies that sellers won't sell now, because they can charge a higher price next year.
Plus, even our "consumer economy" is driven by savings, insofar as it works.  The money-printing of the Fed that abrogates and replaces savings leads only to crash after crash.


Deflation is a very beneficial feature.  No inflating cryptocurrency will compare at all to a deflationary one.

I'm confident that will not be cracked, though.  I've run the sentence through various entropy estimators and obtained similar numbers to what I posted.  I feel no need to prove this is the case to you.  If it's so easy to crack because I pulled the pass phrase from a created work, then it should take no effort to crack it.

Right now, I can send you $50 via Western Union and they will charge me $5.
If I were to send you $50 in Bitcoin, even with a conversion, I would start with buying from say, Coinbase.  (Presumably, if time is of the essence in my operations, I have allowed for "instant buy" through them by giving my credit card info, etc.)  Coinbase charges me $0.50 cents, and my bank charges them $0.15 for an ACH withdrawal, which is passed to me.  Total fees at this stage = $0.65.
Next I send you the ~0.75 BTC, and pay a fee of .0001 BTC (if I choose to!), which amounts to $0.066.  Total transfer fee = $0.716.  Now, even if they charge you another $0.65 to sell on Coinbase or some similar amount on an exchange of some kind, the total transfer is roughly a quarter of the cost of Western Union.  And it scales better, too.
Even better, if you don't need cash, you save a lot of effort there as well!

No, entropy does not work that way.  It *might* make it easier to guess, but it does not reduce entropy in the slightest.  Typically, actual English sentences - particularly long quotes from literature - have relatively high entropy.
Much of the instances I've seen in this subreddit refer to people using some online web page, which *sent the private key to a central server*.  No matter what you used as the pass phrase, that will most certainly be hacked as soon as any significant amount is placed in there.  This is what I meant by failing the rest of the security aspects - a good pass phrase won't matter if you basically give it away, or worse.

History shows that it is inflation, not deflation, that leads to recession and depression.


Typically because economic policy is inflationary.  A deflationary money would allow for the poor to save even a small bit and see that savings appreciate.


The same economists that say "now is a great time for a bubble" every time the previous bubble crashes...  their policy openly creates these bubbles, and the accordant crashes.  The housing bubble was, at its root, Greenspan's fault - for inflating the US dollar.


I argue against that because, scientifically, its not a reasonable worry.  What happens to those that can't get "in" on Bitcoin at the start - that's a reasonable worry.  But "worldwide economic collapse" - that only happens *because of* inflation and then readjustment.  A bunch of loans made with money that didn't previously exist leads to investments that cannot be repaid once prices adjust to the monetary inflation.
