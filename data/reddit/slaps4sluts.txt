The simple fact is that on Reddit, you don't know where/who the advice is coming from in the vast majority of cases. You don't know if it's coming from a hedge fund manager or a 14 year old.
Where you and many others go wrong is thinking that investing is as simple as following a few paragraphs of advice that "seem logical". To an untrained/ignorant eye, a very bad advice looks logical.

I agree, it's more than funny, it's terrible actually. A lot of them don't, that's why research and knowing what questions to ask is extremely important.

Aww, did I make the man-boy mad?
If you keep using that nasty language I'm gonna tell your mommy and daddy!

So you're here saying he should invest **ALL** of his money in lotteries?
Sound advice, internet stranger.

Do you know what fiduciary duty is?
Not all financial advisers are salesmen in the way you're trying to imply.
You should do your research before you give advice. (Research means more than just reading two books)

Thinking he has enough knowledge to know if it will go up or not is what most people would call crazy.
Also, asking for financial advise on Reddit is like walking up to a random stranger on the street and asking them.
He knows nothing of anyone's background or motives. Taking their advice would be foolish, but OP seems pretty foolish anyway.

Your plan for the future is to take dumb risks because you can always live with mommy and daddy?
That's ridiculous.

Already you're pulling numbers out of your ass, which might work in a lot of discussions, but we're talking about finance, so stop with the bullshit.
There are many great financial advisers/planners out there, all he has to do is do some research online, know what kind of questions he needs to ask, and then interview some till he finds the right one.

This would be easy for you to find out on your own. Just do a little research into what stocks preformed the best.
I would imagine that many of them did better than Bitcoin, it's just not easy to predict.

He needs sound investment advice, not anecdotal sayings.
is the **last** place someone should go to for unbiased information. Not to mention OP is asking financial advice from complete strangers.
OP needs to seek out a trained financial adviser.

Every financial adviser on the planet is convinced that you should never put all your eggs into one basket.
That's what he's wanting to do, but since this is a subreddit for circle-jerking about Bitcoin, most of you aren't being honest with him.
If he's convinced it's going to make money, then he should absolutely invest, but investing all of his money is ridiculous.

Having a much better life situation than either of you, I'm 0% in.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:01:25
OP is a child.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:33:33
I suggest he doesn't get advice on Reddit from strangers.
And how can you honestly say he can come to the right place? Financial advise should be as unbiased as possible. R/Bitcoin is hardly unbiased.

Don't take dumb risks. That's just being greedy.
Go talk to an actual financial adviser and if you're not willing to do that, then you don't have the maturity level to be making these kinds of moves.
Jesus christ man, you're asking a Ford dealership if buying a Ford is a good move.
