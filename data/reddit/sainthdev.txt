I bought something on bitmit once, paid immediately to escrow. Seller asked for my address and I didn't hear from him again for 6 months (I got my bitcoins back from escrow). He asked if I still wanted the item and if I would fix the negative rating I gave him.

The community recommends Etsy sellers to tag their items with bitcoin and bitcoins, so searching for those tags return items from sellers who accept bitcoins. Only about 15 items right now. Seems the 32 stores thing is a bit misleading.
I'll see if I can get my wife to tag her stuff.

Make sure to grab the latest Windows 8 signed drivers from AMD. The built-in drivers didn't support mining. I don't think there was anything else tricky about it.

Yeah, running it on Arch Linux now. So far I've noticed no problems (or benefits).

Just send payment as a gift, that's not as easy for people to charge-back and it's the same risk as sending someone bitcoins. You just have to trust the person enough... I've used bitmarket.eu a few times to sell coins for paypal gift payments.

I think two characters would be really difficult to calculate, how about just one? :)

It's to send a gift to someone who is interested in Bitcoin but doesn't yet have a wallet. A lot of my friends are scared to create a wallet because they use Windows and get malware.
