But you have to admit, it could be bitcoin.

Eh, but it might be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:27:11
User activated soft fork. On august first, the bitcoin network will split. If we have enough hashpower, we'll reach the difficulty retarget - that makes the uasf chain more profitable to mine on, bringing more hash power. When segwit activates on the uasf chain, capacity goes up, fees go down, and the November first deadline is beaten. Once the uasf chain is longer than the legacy chain, uasf wins and bitcoin shall regain its former glory. If we reach retarget soon enough. If we activate segwit soon enough. If enough hashpower joins.

Cash deposit with localbitcoins is my go-to method, I went from cash to BTC in half an hour and a trip to the bank. The premium is a little much, but if you're only looking for one or two buys it's not bad. If you want to buy and sell close to market price very often, you'll want to verify your ID with an exchange, and spend the two or so days it takes to deposit cash.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:02:41
The uasf is 2mb? I thought that was the 'Agreement' that isn't scheduled for another year?
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:27:42
The coming shitstorm will surely be grand.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:34:33
Buy sell wait?
Almost, swap the last two.
Buy, wait, then sell. Just don't wait too long, there's an anomaly coming August 1st.
Of course, the three rules always apply.
-Do your own research
-Don't invest more than you can loose
-You haven't lost until you sell. (HODL)

Well, there's USDT...
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:12:26
What's going on with bitfinex? Is it related to usdt? If so, Is poloniex also in trouble?
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:46:16
Alright, so uasf chain can keep going even after the deadline. Thanks for your responses!
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:01:22
No need for the /s, this is actually true. There's a very strong support line around 2000, and then we'll probably bounce back up again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:44:05
MAST makes me excited.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:03:37
Indeed, that is true. I had it messed up in my head :/
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:15:31
This would be good news - so far this is the only rumor of bip148 enforcing hashpower I've heard. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:06:56
This makes sense, only one issue - those signaling generic segwit will need to change to bip148 in order to help build the chain. If a segwit signaler is only connected to uasf nodes then that'll help, but if they then connect to a single legacy node they reorg and they're back to legacy.
I'd really like to know how much hashpower will be enforcing bip148.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:08:58
Right now it is. Come August first it'll split, possibly twice.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:05:52
This would be awesome, we'd have a metric of enforcement power. Maybe such a pool already exists? I'll take a look around.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:19:56
Is there any way to run a full node without downloading the full blockchain? Is it possible to only keep the last X hundred blocks? My current hardware has only a handful of gigabytes free - enough to keep me happy for years, but the blockchain is huge.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:01:20
Convert to XMR via exchanges and/or shapeshift and/or other tools. Send through the XMR network, then convert back to BTC. Sell on localbitcoins.com, or an exchange as the coins can no longer be traced back.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:03:34
You'll want to send your transaction via a node on the chain you want to use.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:40:36
Can you elaborate on the electron and mycelium support?
And as far as I understand, the miners will make the same amount as pre split up until the difficulty retarget - at which point they make a silly amount of profit. I've heard a rumor though that we need 10% hash power or similar just to retarget by November :/
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:37:01
It's going to be hectic. You could sell off both, as can everyone else. All other things equal, the price should halve. From there it's a battle of the chains, and no matter which one wins, it's going to be balls to the wall insane. When the dust settles we'll either have segwit or BIP149 in another year, so hodl on. I won't be touching my coins after the split unless I'm dead certain what will happen, best to play it safe.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:41:38
If BIP148 stops requiring the signal, and the uasf chain is the minority, doesn't the uasf chain re-org? Does this mean the uasf chain has to become longer *before* activating segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:11:00
25% BTC, 37.5% LTC, 37.5% XMR.
Will probably liquidate BTC at the top of the next wave, then buy back in with the usdt and some ltc after August first. I like my xmr, that's sticking around long term.
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:05:14
Op, we need more details here. Either a public key or the original contest announcement, something to convince us this isn't just a random song.

LN is ready, LN is running on litecoin *right now*
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:33:26
We're between two diverging support and resistance lines, which is rather odd. Then again, this is crypto.
If you believe in the power of meme lines, we're looking towards ~$3000 followed by another 'crash' to, idk, the 2100 level?
I drew this up on the first day of the last 'crash' (fib levels added later), so far so good, but meme magic is only so powerful. Trade at your own risk.

This article is about 5 years old. It references a chain split 'yesterday' at block 22xxxx. We're at 47xxxx, more than double that, about 5 years.

Minergate has strong ties to the people behind bytecoin, which is a scam. Mining on a home PC is not profitable. The kid in this video needs to do more research.

So, would you say.... paradigm shift?

We are on the chain that will come to be called the legacy chain.
On August 1st, the chain splits into legacy and Bip148.
Roughly 12 hours later, legacy splits again into legacy and BigBlocks. 
In the end, we'll have legacy (what we have now, could be 'eaten' by Bip148), Bip148 (Enforces segwit signaling), and BigBlocks (controlled by Bitmain and henchmen).
UAHF is an incorrect term for what the BigBlocks chain will be. I call it the BigBlocks chain because it will have big blocks. I'm tempted to join some other users in calling it the Bitmain Activated Ridiculous Fork, or BARF for short.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:31:04
Are you assuming 148 reorgs legacy right away?
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:30:39
Yes, there is a setting to run a 'pruned node'. You'll still need to download and process the entire chain, but it will only save the last half gigabyte or so.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:26:03
Makers provide liquidity (resistance), takers make the price move. 
"Whales keep the price low to accumulate more"
To keep the price low they either put up sell orders to resist upwards movement, or sell at market to actively move the price downwards.
One cannot accumulate more coins by selling them.

The good news is that the coins are recoverable. Addresses come with keys, and the usdt key that poloniex has will work for the btc. 
The bad news is that poloniex might not respond for a very long time.

Between us pros, a pro to pro tip, a protip: you get like crazy returns if you set the background to a different color ;) I know a guy who uses pastels - that's crazy right but there's a rumor about a guy that just has grayscale charts, man he's got to be rolling in it. That's not even a preset theme!

Check the historical price data - every past run up has been over the course of about a month or two. This time though, we know what will pop it :/

We want segwit? We made a fork! Big blocks? A fork! Want something else? Make a fork! I love forks :)

Some more structure in the HTML would be spectacular; such as wrapping groups of things into divs, wrapping the 'server time' element in something. Giving each item an ID would help a lot as well.
[Here's what I cooked up in a few minutes with what you have currently.]( 
Css is:
    h3, h2{
      text-align: center;
      background-color: 
      box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px -6px 
      padding: 10px;
    }
    body{
        max-width: 750px;
        margin: 25px auto;
        background-color: 
    }
    ul{
      background-color: 
      padding: 20px;
      padding-left: 35px;
      box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px -6px

Use an offline system to generate an address. Stamp the keys into a sheet of metal. It's fireproof, waterproof, can't be deleted, cant have a hardware failure,cant be hacked, and will always be useable at any point in the future.

Set a stop loss a few hundred below and/or a sell order a few hundred above, if there's a massive drop and/or massive upswing, you're safe.
