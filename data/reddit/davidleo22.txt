The FBI likely did, but why would they need the NSA? Tarbell could have done it himself. Possibly given the green light just to get the case over with with everyone knowing nobody will understand the technical details.

They have never admitted how they did. He is not being paranoid. So, they did hack it. We just don't know how. If you think this is out there just read an account of the case. You know 2 of the investigators also went on trial?

It's an odd story if only because the narrative offered from LE seems to be being retrofitted, but this is possibly just down to the sheer scale of the operation. The great irony is that if true Tarbell and co. were ultimately beaten to it by an IRS tax officer using google (and Windows 10 and IE going by the storie's picture). The infiltration at that point was quite excessive so it's more surprising nobody had worked it out already.

It's not that shocking. Even a cursory glance at the case brings up three dodgy elements: (1) No admission of how the server was hacked (2) 2 agents who turned out to be extorting Bitcoin and (3) confusion over timelines. None of this means conspiracy. It just means real people got greedy or needed results. If you don't think this happens then...read the story in many account of his case and see how it did. There is nothing far out about it.

Excellent, thank you.
