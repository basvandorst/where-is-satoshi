I was looking at the site wirex which offers a bitcoin wallet... is that still okay? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:07:53
Am I right in thinking that I buy bitcoin of say... coin base then transfer to electrum? Is it as easy as that?

For sure! Appreciate the advice but is there evidence for the price to go up to 6-8K? Obviously nobody can tell the future but is there calculated guesses that the number will rise or is it currently just speculation based on history

Im in the same boat as you! Although i think i may wait for it to dip after the fork before i invest 2000 in it!
Did you use coinbase? any tips when starting out that you didnt know and wish you had known before? Bitcoin noob here

Care to explain a bit further your reasoning? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:40:35
Yeah was kinda thinking that! I've noticed bitcoin to be a currency that seems to be able to remain strong and able to get back on its feet pretty quickly, I'm noway near knowledgable enough in finance as to why that is but it's reassuring!

It's just logical, nobody can predict he future, success and failure are equal in probability. Surely you can see why one might be worried/curious.

Someone posted on here that if I link my account to gdax and coinbase together I don't pay fees? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:44:20
Thanks for the tips, what's the difference between market order and limit order? I have about 7k in free flow money and 25k in savings account I don't touch 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:14:07
Is there any downfall to linking to GDAX? Like what's the purpose apart from no fees
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:36:00
Can you suggest any wallet options? Specifically names I can research/google? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:00:54
I may be completely wrong but from what I understand there should be a new currency that splits in November and whatever bitcoin you have you'll get the same amount of that currency? I don't really get it either 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:29:26
I don't want to hahah I'd get my ass chewed

There's ways to give yourself more accurate ways to  invest money. I mean as far as I can see from this sub is most people don't even know why the rise in bitcoin happened overnight today. That to me doesn't sound like a very good thing! As for the future it's all speculation, just too risky for me. Just because I want to take less risk doesn't mean I'm going to find it hard to make money, sure I may not become a millionire but I see it as a more favourable route than taking so much risk

Hardly seeing it as an investment opportunity to worry about the fluctuation of the prices. I get that it's revolutionary, but as far as anyone knows your bitcoins COULD become worth so much less in a couple of years making you lose more traditionally accepted fiat money even if you didn't plan to invest in it for a quick buck but generally investing in the ideology of bitcoin..
