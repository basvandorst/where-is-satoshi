Whaa? I emailed them last week and they said they had no official plans to open one, although they were looking into it. 
Whelp, whatever, I'll be there tomorrow.

Centralization is a necessary evil during construction. 
Besides, the function of BTC and ETH are very different. BTC is a store of value, ETH is a utility. Most businesses in the Bitcoin space are built *around* bitcoin; businesses in Ethereum are built *on* the Ethereum network. 
If bitcoin is digital gold, ether is digital oil. In my opinion both will be equally important in the cryptoworld as the years go on. The idea of Bitcoin as the single global cryptocurrency is dead IMO. Diversify your portfolio.

I am. I have no idea what will happen when it comes time for Ethereum to scale beyond hope for the best. I just believe that the technical problems are trivial in comparison to the community ones, as the last year of bitcoin has demonstrated.

It will have far less than Bitcoin, because Vitalik Buterin &amp; the Ethereum foundation are the de facto stewards of the coin over the next few years while development is finalized. 
There's a reason that guy is labelled 'the Satoshi who stayed' by the ETH community. Having a centralized development team being led by a truly brilliant dude means that, barring a complete disconnect between the user base and the foundation, Ethereum will never run into the ridiculous problems that have plagued bitcoin over the last year. 
Bitcoin has been so considered with it's nerd civil war over block size that it's progress and mass adoption have ground to a halt.

That's why I said it's not comparable, I'm just arguing against your preposition that being first is enough. It isn't. And you CAN move from one crypto to another pretty seamlessly. Obviously if it happened *en masse* then it would cause extreme price swings for the two coins in question, but it can be done.

Atari was first too. Not that I think bitcoin is in any way comparable, nor do I think it will ever truly die, but the blockchain space will be about cryptocurrencies in general and not just bitcoin IMO.

Point 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are truly terrible opinions. 6 and 7 are valid concerns.

Really? What do you think would have happened a year ago if Satoshi Nakamoto had emerged and given one side in the block size debate his unequivocal blessing? 
I'm not saying Buterin is perfect, but I am saying that when it comes to influencing masses of people having the 'creator' of something weigh in is enough to tip the scales.

The GUI is dumbed down, but the terminal is pretty powerful.

Mike Tyson has gone from hated to a beloved hero of pop culture folklore. He'll be fine.
