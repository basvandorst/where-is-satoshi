Thanks for the response, Tony. It seems like we have differing views on what a hero is, which is totally understandable :). I'll be the first to admit that I intentionally use the term Bitcoin hero similarly to how Time magazine went about Person of the Year in 2006. I'd argue that anonymous Bitcoiners around the world, the ones that have convinced their business-owning friends to accept Bitcoin (often through BitPay), are all heroes every time they explain Bitcoin and participate in some word of mouth marketing. I also agree that the "bitcoin celebrity" thing has caused damage alongside the good. Said celebrities often become targets for scammers and those looking to pay for credibility by association with Ponzi monies. No need to drop names :).
Thanks again for the thought provoking post and discussion. This is the kind of stuff that should be on the front page of @_date: 2015-06-18 16:12:55
Your idea of the word "trusted" is wayyyy off.
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:39:19
That is very true but largely more true within one country. Bitcoin is international enough to be the industry to change the status quo.
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:51:41
Who needs to be a "bitcoin celebrity" when you can be a genuine Bitcoin hero? Keep doing what you do!
Auger is undoubtedly going to be one of those things that changes the mainstream perception of Bitcoin and block chain technology; you're a hero for all you've done :D.

I didn't take a single programming course in college, but I was able to carve out a niche area in the crypto industry for myself. You can do it too :).  If, however, you are capable of picking up programming languages... **do not** discount the advice of those telling you to self-study programming regardless of what you do.

Dear Congress,
Bitcoin is a revolutionary currency created, spent, and invested by hundreds of thousands of Americans.
Big banks and big government bureaucrats don't like the idea of money over which they have no control. But freedom from government &amp; Wall Street interference is Bitcoin's greatest asset.
We call on Congress and the Obama Administration to allow **BitCoin**, the world's first free, global and stateless currency, to evolve and flourish free of unnecessary government interference.

You said the withdrawals were initiated in January, correct?  Yen withdrawals were the last part of Gox's arsenal to get used up and up until January the yen withdrawals only took a day or two, right?  Clearly the yen withdrawals became just as clogged or limited by Gox's bank and that's why we're still getting trickling reports of fiat entering peoples' banks through SEPA or yen.  The money has been floating for weeks in your instance, months in some other peoples' instances, and it has finally arrived.  Mt. Gox let it go months ago and I'm sure they'd like to take it back now but they can't :P.

1. You'd need an external gpu enclosure \(more money than it's worth if you're just mining\).

It's likely that he has gotten a texas bitcoin conference email to use through his gmail because he's a volunteer for the TBC through the Austin Bitcoin meetup group.
Also incredibly likely, his Coinbase wallet has been hacked as well.
Clearly someone targeting those with Bitcoins was in this guy's email and wise enough to realize he could enhance his phishing with that access.
The next question is... are you in Austin TX? How did he get your email address?

The question really is, have your Bitcoin aspirations completely overwritten your previous Med School intentions?  You seem to have a lot invested into that path and it is very humanly possible to continue your schooling while being involved in the Bitcoin sphere.

**Especially** after the two recent hacks, the Bitcoin community wants the funds to be put to use or returned.
Stuff like theymos not being in control of bitcointalk.org's domain name doesn't really matter to the public at large.  All the public cares about is there is a very large sum of monies sitting under the control of someone seemingly unwilling to do anything productive with it...
Of course, the public needs to understand that "thermos" is just an unfortunate figurehead in all this want for a better bitcointalk.  The actual problem, including mobilization of the funds for refund or use, involves more action than just that of theymos.
Best of luck to you...

Low and incredibly low mean the same thing in these contexts: improbable.

Dear BtcTrade users and the greater Bitcoin community:
I write this announcement with a heavy heart, BtcTrade just received a phone call from the HangZhou Science and Technology City Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China requiring that I stop using company accounts to clear Bitcoin trades.  If we are late in stopping,  they will freeze the company’s bank account on April 15th.  As such, at BtcTrade we have no choice but to stop RMB recharges starting 4/15 at 0:00; trading is not affected.
Since the beginning, BtcTrade has set out to face the international market.  We have already registered as companies in mainland China, Chinese Hong Kong, Japan, and also the United States.  Very soon, we will open USD trading; simultaneously, we will open our Japanese website.  The new version will be online by April 15th. During the move, we will announce our cold storage address and guarantee 100% transparency.  To ensure that the platform doesn’t participate in any trade and that user funds are completely secure, we invite you all to please monitor us.
We are a persistent and simple team, in the first year of our formal operation we have been hard at work to build a simple, convenient, yet secure trading platform.  We don’t trade on our platform, we don’t offer leverage, shorting, or other services like that.  Out team members do what they can to facilitate the development and spread of Bitcoin.  We firmly believe that BtcTrade still has a bright future, and Bitcoin’s future will be immeasurable!

Human translation of Caixin article: 
【Caixin】（Reporter: Li SuiSui）
In the morning of April 24, PBOC met with some commercial banks and 3rd party payment processors to discuss the next step in bitcoin risk prevention, hoping to completely cut off the funding line into Bitcoin trading.
On 4/22, the Central Bank, through the Payment and Clearing Organization of China, initiated this meeting. Interviewees include all commercial banks and 3rd party payment processors related to Bitcoin, with the total number of participants no less than 20. These include various large commercial banks, Paypal, Tenpay and other large scale payment processors which includes Huobi.com’s recharge code provider, EPRO payments.
The meeting is chaired by the Central Bank Department of Treaty and Law Director Mu Huaipeng, other participants include Secretary Lai Yue as well as other PBOC officials, all of who have higher standards than ever before.
Central bankers have stated that this meeting is focused on Bitcoin’s significant price rebound after 4/15, which led to an awkward situation as accounts were not cleared to expectations.
It was in March that the PBOC issued the 《Notice on Further Strengthening Bitcoin Risk Prevention Measures》, that emphasized that commercial banks and 3rd party payments processors were not to perform services for Bitcoin trading，establishing 4/15/14 as a deadline. However，come 4/15，many Bitcoin trading platforms were still functioning; Bitcoin’s exchange rate also soared from 2,500 Yuan to 3,000 Yuan.

Less than 20% of our articles get submitted to reddit, many of our competitors keep that ratio at 100%.

I believe it to be the work of a third party, Asian firm.  The document is only purported to be from within Gox's coverup, not fabricated by them.  The current theory is that it was a plan distributed in an attempt to find White Knight investors.
From the language in the document (The way they write about Karpeles for one) it is clear as day that the document was not made by anyone at Gox.
  
As TBI has said, the data checks out.

Most buildings in East Asian countries do not have a 4th floor because of the number 4's similarity/association with the word for death (Obviously, there is a 4th floor, it's just labeled as the 5th floor). The embedded superstition created by that centuries old practice means that when the Western concept of 13 as an unlucky number made its way to Japan, arguably the most Westernized East Asian country (by historical intention), the floor 13 also became omitted, sometimes.

In contrast to the 3/21/14 incident mentioned by OKCoin, this news was broken by Caixin not Sina.  More importantly, the original article has not yet been rescinded.  In the original rescinded Sina article that turned out not to be true, it was claimed that on 3/18/14 a document was released that would have banned Bitcoin transactions in China by 4/15/14.
The PBOC took to Weibo to announce that:
“Regarding the PBOC statement issued on 3/18 requesting all bitcoin transactions to be halted before 4/15, those close to the regulatory body told Sina Finance on Friday, the PBOC **did issue a document**, but it was not to ban/halt bitcoin transactions, instead to **strengthen regulatory oversight of bitcoin transactions, circulation and redemptions.**”

As I've mentioned... OKCoin, BTCTrade, BTC38, and Huobi's CEOs saying this doesn't prove that the article printed in every major Chinese media source is FUD.

Please try to think straight, folks.

Racist Materials
Surveillance Equipment
Tobacco Sales
Travel Clubs
I only talked about a handful in the article.  Obviously some "industries" such as Ponzi Schemes and Pyramid-Type Sales are also worming their way into the Bitcoin world, and were some of the first to do so.

The truth! That calculator only does one difficulty change per month, and assumes constant exponential growth of difficulty at that... Meaning it is UTTERLY USELESS for anything larger than a 2 month estimate, and grossly overestimates anything within the 2 month window.

To maintain our source's anonymity, CCN will not be publishing the Japanese lawsuit, or the real names of Mr. Dubois or his company/project.
The **tl;dr** of this story is this: Karpeles stole 15,000 Euro from a man on his hospital bed and lied about it the entire way through.
Bitcoin was in no way involved.

Obviously, Reddit is one of the sources that our team of freelancers scour for news. Individual authors often like to submit their posts to this subreddit, the other bots that submit ccn articles are the same ones that submit articles from everywhere. CCN doesn't have a team of bots upvoting stuff on reddit. CCN doesn't even have a team of bots submitting articles "back" to Reddit. Please try to use some common sense.
I will pass your and the community's recommendation to cut sponsored stories up the chain of command, as I have before.

The stated issue is that they "look" like metal round things, which puts them under eBay's gross jurisdiction to apply their ToS at will.  This is unfortunate for you, but you'd have a much better case if you started making square "coins."

Especially large volume players like you're referring to would try dollar cost averaging [not crossing the spread in one huge jump and one single transaction as you incorrectly assume] and would specifically go to exchanges with maker/taker models to post a buy OR go to exchanges with dark liquidity pools with better rates than second market.
Your point is a good one but an incredibly general one, but buying your Bitcoins through SecondMarket isn't like buying them through Coinbase, you're forced to pay their annual fee... Every year you continue to hold the Bitcoins through the Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Trust me, there's nothing nice about buying Bitcoins at a "small improvement in price" if after 10 years you have to fork over 40% of the value.

Newsweak was on probationary status at best in terms of being a reputable news outlet in the U.S.
Caixin reporters claim to have seen the document. So that is one piece of evidence, that has yet to come out as you have noted, but does exist.  The authenticity of a 3/18/14 document that hasn't been released to the public has been confirmed by the PBOC when they shot down the FUD on 3/21/14.
Bobby Lee via WSJ: 
Bobby Lee, Chief Executive Officer of BTC China, said in a telephone interview he had not seen the document but is concerned the reports could be true.
Mr. Lee said under PBOC practices, the ruling on bank accounts may never be publicly announced but could be enforced through direct channels with banks.
Which means all the exchanges popping up to say they haven't heard anything from the PBOC, aren't evidence any which way.

Also, I didn't give up my SSN, that is not a requirement, not even the last four digits.
Can't argue with the palm print though... Besides the fact that if the government already has my fingerprints, what more is the palm?  I'm pretty sure anyone willing to obscure their fingers for privacy purposes can do the same to their palm.
Not to mention just think of all the information you give to an exchange or Coinbase.

Hey there, FEC reached a tie so Bitcoin donations are not yet officially to be accepted as in-kind donations.  However, many state and federal political candidates have gone ahead and started accepting Bitcoin.  Cashing out immediately and legitimately through Coinbase or BitPay is a must.

【Caixin】（Reporter: Li SuiSui）
In the morning of April 24, PBOC met with some commercial banks and 3rd party payment processors to discuss the next step in bitcoin risk prevention, hoping to completely cut off the funding line into Bitcoin trading.
On 4/22, the Central Bank, through the Payment and Clearing Organization of China, initiated this meeting. Interviewees include all commercial banks and 3rd party payment processors related to Bitcoin, with the total number of participants no less than 20. These include various large commercial banks, Paypal, Tenpay and other large scale payment processors which includes Huobi.com’s recharge code provider, EPRO payments.
The meeting is chaired by the Central Bank Department of Treaty and Law Director Mu Huaipeng, other participants include Secretary Lai Yue as well as other PBOC officials, all of who have higher standards than ever before.
Central bankers have stated that this meeting is focused on Bitcoin’s significant price rebound after 4/15, which led to an awkward situation as accounts were not cleared to expectations.
It was in March that the PBOC issued the 《Notice on Further Strengthening Bitcoin Risk Prevention Measures》, that emphasized that commercial banks and 3rd party payments processors were not to perform services for Bitcoin trading，establishing 4/15/14 as a deadline. However，come 4/15，many Bitcoin trading platforms were still functioning; Bitcoin’s exchange rate also soared from 2,500 Yuan to 3,000 Yuan.

The team of investigators has already pointed out that most hashtalk forum members/GAW-believers have been conditioned to only say positive things, and at every opportunity presented. What is the news here? 
Manipulation of the comment systems that are used by CoinDesk and CryptoCoinsNews, aka use of new accounts, is forbidden whether it is anti-GAW or pro-GAW. Offensive and harassing comments are removed, no matter their content.
I think the investigators should also be able to figure out that the entire point of your comment is to crap on "craptocoinsnews.com."

In the "selfish pool" you describe that is propagating a blatant double spend in order to earn a higher tx fee, or both tx fees potentially  (actually plausible despite how ridiculous it sounds)...
If there's an attempted double spend in a newly mined block, does the pool that mined it get to choose which of the two TX's to transmit, the original or the double spend?
Or is there the third option of including both and collecting both fees and letting the next pool that mines the block deal with it?

Heya! Don't have gold at the moment so it took me quite some time to see this.
I'm enrolled in the program, was accepted back in January.  I hear you on the concerns of the usability of the degree.  The success of any program is dependent on the institution and its connections as well as its graduates.  Given the close ties of UNic and Neo and Bee, as well as the current Cyproit circumstances that bred that relationship, I'd say that the first half is set.  The rest depends on those people willing to take a lunge into the first Digital Currency program in the world.
I'm also hoping that completing this degree will put me in a great position for a career at the companies you've mentioned.

Slight corrections: Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we're talking about aren't trying to be anonymous. You know they're willing to be known so the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or you could build a similar technology where there's enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.

Except that CCN has never done that for a known and proven scam. I'm sure you have noticed by now that CCN is/was not the only site that has ads for GAW or had ads for Bitcoin Trader.
It seems to me that a misunderstanding of how CCN sells ads and sponsored stories and functions as a business is why you only attack me and CCN. Please correct me if I'm wrong...
I constantly repeat it for the readers that may not fully understand that selling ad space and clearly marked sponsored stories is an established and accepted practice in media that is practiced by your favorite mainstream news sources as well.
When X company buys ads from Y company, X company has not "bought" Y company in the way that Josh Garza has publicly stated that he has bought a news site. I was participating in this discussion started by OP, not you.

Here is the text of the provision:


Those familiar with Canadian politics and the Canadian budget process will remember that the biannual budget implementation bill is often referred to as an "omnibus bill."
Because the ruling party shoves a bunch of unrelated provisions into the high priority bill, effectively pushing them through the House of Commons without proper debate.

It isn't clear how many Bitcoins have been stolen yet at this point.
the Number floating around, 4474.26, only accounts for the transactions revealed by Defcon which may or may not be all the transactions associated with attacker 1.
Furthermore, there are transactions from attacker 2 and 3 that supposedly account for 5% of the total heist to be added to that sum.

I don't lie. I took your opinion at face value, thanks for clarifying...
Sponsored stories are a part of our bread and butter and they aren't all that different from a text ad especially now that we employ no-follow. 
To clarify for you, since it seems you have missed this point, Google doesn't list our sponsored stories at all, anymore.
Sponsored stories ARE biased reporting. Nobody has ever claimed otherwise. Readers should always seek to identify and consider biases in anything that they read. Everything from articles to ads to article comments to Reddit comments: Our conversation here on Reddit is a great example of two people with biased opinions butting heads. Yet, a reader will still be able to garner objective information from our exchange despite your vitriol. 
**tl;dr; CCN has already taken steps to even further differentiate sponsored content from regular content. Your input, as always, is very valued.**

In a previous article, I highlighted how Chinese folk usually get past the $50,000 a year limit, without Bitcoin.  They will often recruit their friends/relatives to move chunks of the money overseas to buy beachhouses in Cyprus, for instance.  Real Estate Agencies around the world are quickly figuring out that they need to turn a blind eye to such things or risk losing valuable Chinese customers.

I'll have you know that you shouldn't hold your breath to "recieve" a notice from the Central Bank of China.  The Central Bank of China is the Central Bank of Taiwan.

There are a few living incarnations of what you are talking about. The Crypto Castle, is on the smaller side; on the other hand, 20Mission is big and usually always has vacancy (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Both are in Norcal.
Such a complex would be popular in cities with corresponding Bitcoin startup scenes and friendly state regulations. Forget setting it up in NYC; instead, consider a place like Denver, Atlanta, DC, or Austin/Houston. 
Texas has very favorable guidelines for virtual currency businesses:
If you're really forward looking, you could shoot for Charlotte. North Carolina has recently exempted certain Bitcoin businesses from regulation. They differentiate between Bitcoin companies logically. If you're a company that only ever holds 1 key out of 3 in a multisig security scheme... logic prevails in NC :).

The University of Nicosia's Master's of Science in Digital Currencies is a much more legit sounding program in my opinion.
Not to mention, since the University of Nicosia has been accepting Bitcoin for payments for all programs and fees, including at their affiliate programs/universities including some in the United Kingdom.

In terms of BTC volume, it is very significant.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:09:56
There are only a handful of coins (SHA256) that would consider that. Coins on other algorithms would need to "downgrade" their hashin algorithm in order to do so, something the community won't be keen on.

The days of flash crashes on specific news dropping are certainly over, I agree. In this instance, the "news" is more of a pall that has been rippling through mainstream media and still is.

There's plenty of potential utilizations of the Bitcoin blockchain that don't require a bank, or a bank beholden Bitcoin payment processing company.
Provenance can and should be time stamped onto the Bitcoin blockchain - the most immutable record available to man currently. Here's an example: 
Even so -
I posit that any company, especially a brick and mortar company, has some expenses that can be spent on Amazon (on Purse) using btc. Or if one of their employees agree to be paid in btc. When they receive the btc, they can hold it in something like coinapult lock to maintain its usd value

@_date: 2016-09-10 06:12:42
Just like other schools, some courses were better than others. The Master's degree is 9 courses in total. The first course is available for free as a MOOC and has been taken by well over 1000 students.
The last 3 courses can be a programming focus or not, or you can choose to do a thesis.
Even in the non-cryptocurrency related classes, I learned economics that I wasn't able to touch on in my undergraduate degree.

You'll get an automated email from SIS whenever your next module is ready. It sounds like they might be waiting for more students to sign up before starting the new courses. I had a similar experience as you while waiting months between the free MOOC and the paid classes, but it will eventually get started :). Feel free to ask me any other questions!

Electrum is an HD wallet, which allows you to generate the private key from a non random seed (which you should memorize). This allows you to regenerate that private key using that seed (usually 12 or 24 words from an English word bank).
Moving the mouse around is a way to create entropy so that the keys you create aren't "recreate-able."
Both types of pub/priv keys can be used to generate multiple addresses.
Hope this helps!

They are seriously trying to market a motherboard with only 1 PCI-e 16x lane as a Mining Motherboard?  It's kind of clear that most of you redditors here on don't know the first thing about GPU Mining.
Besides the fact that it "isn't profitable".
There's actually **nothing at all** special about this motherboard besides the name.  You will still be required to use powered PCI-e risers just like every other motherboard.  By the time they put a price on this thing I guarantee there will be equivalent motherboards already on the market for less than half the price.

I also agree that capping hash percentages is an awful policy.  Historically, miners have switched between the major pools, and more and more have gone to p2pool, to avoid any one node having too much of the total network hashrate.

While we continue to romanticize this idea. In reality we have to acknowledge the fact that for us viewers on the outside we will never know the truth.
If in fact there is a 2nd more recent DPR that is still out there, he is undoubtedly laying low. If the two of them are the idealists they claim to be: the first DPR will accept the blame for ALL the crimes and will accept conviction.
Any moving of the encrypted funds totaling 600000 btc which could be under the control of DPR1 or DPR2 or a combo of the two, would raise suspicion.

Your vendetta against CryptoCoinsNews is becoming increasingly stale.  Since I've become editor things have changed and I can guarantee there is no copyright-infringement verbatim copies of other people's texts.  Sources are **always** cited.
If one of our posts, not articles, featuring a youtube video makes its way into this subreddit go ahead and downvote it, it's likely a repost anyways.  I welcome your criticisms and I understand you clearly prefer news sites without copious advertisements.  But, seriously, stick to your true claims and stop with the false ones. OK?

Participating in an attack on Bitcoin would render any Bitcoin valued mining contract untenable.. which goes against the contrived scenario Vitalik put forth.  Hence the only way that his scenario would work is if there were a trusted service that would pay on a Bitcoin mining contract after Bitcoin as we know it is no more.. aka in USD.

You are also correct in that the notion of BTC exchange rate change doesn't need to be present at all.  I just included it because many people, including lots of miners unfortunately, still do their valuations in USD :P.

The severity of the "undermining" in a selfish mining attack on Bitcoin and a usd counterfeiter on USD are orders of magnitude apart.
Essentially my argument is that participating in an attack on Bitcoin, in the way that the paper suggests would happen, would result in no value gained for anyone involved because Bitcoin won't be the *same* after such an attack.
The only danger is, was, and always will be an **irrational actor**. For instance, if Intel secretly built a line of 14nm sha-256 hashing ASICs and launched a good old fashion'd 51% attack to double spend attack all Bitcoin services until they are done for. Why would Intel do that? Who/What would/could incentivize Intel to do such a thing?  That's a story for the conspiracy theorists :P.

Yeah, if Bitcoins are classified in that worst tax classification possible with an annual VAT, then *maybe* BIT's fees will offset capital gains taxes.  I suggest "sophisticated investors" to use BIT for a few years until US laws become clearer.

Very true.  Double spending is the least of Bitcoin's and Coinbase's worries if that does happen though.  A good example of what you're saying is inputs.io that was previously touted as an off the chain transaction hub, even used by just-dice for awhile.

This is the **exact same** article that btc38.com put out that was on this subreddit yesterday.  That it has been reposted by another Chinese site obviously adds credibility as BTCChina has yet to make a formal English announcement about this.
I translated the article to get the meat.  Basically, BTC China has created a cold storage based security system for its users to combat the propaganda that Bitcoin is risky [for reasons other than volatility ;p] that went up 12/20.  Since then, Bobby Lee has come up with a new way to allow Chinese Yuan, Ren Min Bi, to exchange hands. AKA **deposits and withdrawals**

Seriously, having a problem with a news site that depends on paid advertising for the advertising aspect as is 's vendetta is one thing.
Questioning the integrity of **my work** is another thing entirely.  This subreddit is full of people that are still claiming these billboards are photoshopped, are you one of them?  Out of the several posts revealing these billboards in the last two days, only one has positive upvotes.
I'm providing a legit news source for people to verify that this phenomenon is actually happening. Or would you rather wait a week for Coindesk or The Genesis Block to write an article about this, if they ever do?

Well, for now, as far as we know, it isn't put up by a corporation.  While the billboard does "advertise" Bitcoin, what it is really doing is "advertising" the owner's public key and begging for donations.  The owner hasn't yet publicly said that he/she is going to donate all or any of the proceeds to Sean's Outpost or Fr33 Aid or some other Bitcoin accepting charity.

From Vitalik, the author of the bitcoinmagazine article:


Not necessarily. Here’s what you could do:
1. Buy a miner
2. Short a mining contract for the same amount of GH/s
3. Join a selfish pool
If you do (1) and (2), you have zero net exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem, so (3) in theory makes economic sense.
So I think the better point to make is to specifically point out that my above scenario is highly contrived and game-theoretic models don’t always reflect reality.

from a small business's perspective
For a small business owner/operator, Bitcoin payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay will always have lower fees than Levelup, Clinkle, Square, Google Wallet, Paypal, etc. This is due to the latter bunch being tied in with the CC companies, and the former bunch being tied with Bitcoin's intrinsic superiority as a medium of exchange. :)
However, for individual users the use case is a little less obvious and/or pressing. They might feel that paypal, square, levelup, clinkle and that group is better suited to adapting their huge leather wallet full of gift cards and credit cards to a more useable form.
This is why we must continue to encourage small businesses to offer discounts matching with the lowered fees and negligible risk of chargeback so that consumers and merchants are promoting the use of Bitcoin.
The scenario I have laid out may never happen in the United States; however, in other countries the incentives to do so are so so so much higher.
