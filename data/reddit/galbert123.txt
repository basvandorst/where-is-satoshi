I would love to see an episode revolve around bitcoin. The question is who would get sucked in. I think Kramer first. Then he gets george to buy in. George sells at the wrong time. Kramer wins.

Not even bitcoin is safe from being infected with political/gender bullshit

I know wallstreet's value-add is allocating capital, but isnt there a large portion the is simply parasitic with no value ad? Like the derivative market?

They also add like $50 to the buy price and subtract $50 from the sell price that seems to be separate from the fee itself. Please correct me if im wrong, but it seems like the buy price vs. the quote is always higher.

I'm just pissed I bought some at 6800. I feel like it wont drop below 7 again which was my previous buy threshold. I guess next weeks buy will be at 8...

Make sure you clearly define what is and what is not a swear word.

I have some cash I would like to put directly into bitcoin. Nothing major, about $1,000. Could I buy an instant visa card and use that in coinbase? I already have a coinbase account linked to a bank account. Just curious is this is an option of quickly converting cash to btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:49:20
fine for me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:08:18
but an instant card is fine?

I've read buying these from amazon is risky, and to buy direct from the manufacturer. Is this true?
