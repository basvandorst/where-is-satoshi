If Segwit adoption stays on these levels for more than 6 months, I would agree to a 2 mb increase but right now a temporary high fees market is not the end of the world for BTC and might actually help pushing SegWit adoption and LN adoption. Dog biting its tail.

I know, but the whole cryptospace is seeing an unprecedented amount of new users coming in. Hopefully it will be a temporary issue.
Bitcoin.de is not an exchange per se, it' more of an e-scrow service that puts users in contact with each others. 
But there are other options as well. This is a new sector growing. Expects great success cases and epic failures (Mt.Gox style).

You have no idea what you are talking about IMHO.


Proof of this? Because I have proof of the exact opposite phenomenon so far. Since Bcash and BGold forked the BTC price has skyrocketed. There is no correlation at all IMO.


Superior? What does that mean? If SHA256 isn't cracked (and as of now it cannot be cracked), there is absolutely no reason to switch to another one. You can't be safer than safe.


Oh, the no intrinsic value argument lol. Bitcoin has huge intrinsic value because it can validate and timestamp. A decentralized global network of users which can guarantee that a transaction actually happened is already a big deal. And I could go on and on.


You just described our society right now and you don't even realize it.
Also everyone buying bitcoins now and up until next halving at least could still be considered early adopters. Wealth distribution in Bitcoin is so much better than what we have now.

I am sorry but you just don't understand Bitcoin at all. Do more research. I am not interested in educating you about this. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:16:05
1. Maybe, maybe not. But there is absolutely no proof that hard forks hinder BTC value in any way.
2. The network is what it is important. You do not build a network as global, secure and decentralized as Bitcoin out of the blue. Altcoins have a long way to go before reaching what Bitcoin has accomplished. And if Bitcoin fails chances are all cryptos will fail because people won't trust cryptos anymore.The whole cryptospace go as far as Bitcoin goes.
3. I don't think you are in a position to give me advices, but thanks anyway.
4. Let me understand this. You don't vote but you expect politicians to change things? I might be wrong but I think you are still very young.
The current establishment will try everything they can to stop Bitcoin. I honestly think that they still have to realize and understand what Bitcoin is (like most people) but I fully expect a reaction in the near future. Point is I think they simply cannot stop it anymore, more or less like the huge music and movie industry couldn't stop Bittorrent.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:17:05

That doesn't mean he is wrong. Everybody is a random person on the interwebz, yourself included.
I studied psychology for more than 10 years and I totally agree with what he said. You don't need to be a doctor to understand the cause of someone's demons. Ask buddhist monks, ask philosophers or just ask your grandmother if I am not right about this. Also, alchool clearly had a role in all of this.

"Past performance is not indicative of future results".
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:04:48
Can love drive someone to suicide? Yes, and it can also drive people to kill somebody else. That doesn't mean that love is the cause of that.
The environment you grew up in, your personal history (traumas, shocking events etc), the state of your mind at any particular point in your life (substance abuse, obsession, fantasies), and your relations with people around you define how you *react* to things.
Point is there is never a single identifiable cause of your psychological issues (that's why I think the title of this thread is extremely misleading). It's always a mixture of factors, although your personal history and the environment you grew up in tend to play a huge role. So I guess we can agree on this now, that means this conversation had a purpose maybe :-D
I understand where you are coming from. I just don't like when people say you are not a doctor so STFU, because that is plain stupid.
I happen to think that we live in a society where doctors had somehow took too much power over our life. And most of the times they don't know much more than we do. 
Anyway, thanks for the conversation. I actually enjoyed it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:50:23
1. Are you kidding me? I told you that the exact opposite has happened so far. Since the two forks have happened the BTC price literally exploded. Keep ignoring facts.
2. Proof of what? Proof that SHA256 is secure? It is. When they crack that (if they will ever do that) Bitcoin can switch to a different algorythm and adapt. Or die. But right now there is no reason to be worried about that.
3. I've been into BTC since 2013, I am pretty happy with what I have.
4. I never voted in my entire life.

I am sorry for you and your family. I also think that title is extremely misleading. It's sad but it's obvious to me that your brother had problems that went well beyond Bitcoin. If your brother was happy with the life he had, he would have not committed suicide, despite the huge opportunity he missed (also he could have bought BTC back at any point with significant profits).
Wasted opportunities can be a reason for suicide only for an already troubled mind. My condolences.

Oh, one of those guys who think that only "doctors" can talk about mental health and depression. This is really sad. There are countless cases where doctors are totally ignorant of facts related to your suffering (mental health or even physical health) and an average guy like me or u/isaiahtx can clearly see the problem.
The idea that only doctors can talk about health is one of the most stupid ideas our society has forced into our mind.

@_date: 2017-12-03 02:39:19


I asked for proofs of your first statement and you come up with more speculation.


The only purpose of the algorythm is to make the network safe. And the Bitcoin network is the safest network we have on this planet right now. You can't do better than this. There is no more secure than secure, I already told you.


So you think people will start buying fully centralized government coins? lol good luck with that. I honestly think you have no idea what the real intrinsic value of Bitcoin is: is being fully decentralized, global, trustless and permissionless money nothing of value in your opinion?


Democracy lol Sovereign states are run by centralized institutions like the FED, big corporations, and special interests. Politicians are there to protect interests not to help the 3.6 billion people we were talking about.

What could actually happen in your opinion if SHA256 is cracked? How fast can BTC fork to a different algorythm? Do the devs have a plan B ready to implement in case of this unfortunate and unlikely event?

Not true. Because the fiat world is not going to change, it's already established, while the BTC world is still evolving. 
Don't forget that only 12 million BTC have been mined so far. From now on 9 million BTC will be distributed in a much fairer way (pools rule mining operations right now).
Furthermore the reason why few people hold so many BTC is because they were smarter than us. We all had equal opportunities, but they were in the right place at the right time.
On the contrary our fiat world is ruled by banks (i.e. those entities who own the capital). They can manipulate both the currencies we use and the markets we operate on (through Central Banks). Is that fair?

While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights. Unique among North American professional team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting[6] but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection.[7] Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

I am indeed interested in the Austrian school, although not so much in its popularized internet version. I am more interested in Murray Rothbard:

I don't know what you are talking about. Ferguson's article is clear, honest, and based on facts.
Also I didn't say that Krugman is always wrong o that he is a bad person. I just said that he is an overrated economist. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:00:21
I call BS.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:01:01
BTC is the cheapest way to move money around the world. Deal with it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:01:34
I said "depending on the kind of investment you are talking about". Options are obviously gambling. And so are futures IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:08:35
Again. Saving is not hoarding. So I agree with you I think.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:43:23
Bitcoin future in doubt. This is the kind of BS we were expecting.

I can tell by responses like this that some people actually *believe* Apple could help the development of the Bitcoin network. Apple will never back a system like Bitcoin, which is completely out of their control. If you didn't notice that, *freedom* is not a very popular word in the Apple world.
And yes. Apple sucks. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:24:05
Looks like you need a multisignature address, although it's a little different from what you described.

People usually say it's the biggest technological innovation since the internet. It's a different thing.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:45:15
It's also one of the most promising ;)
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:52:04
When you speak to thousands of people who are waiting for your opinion, you shouldn't say something like that.
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:38:58
Is it necessary to *believe* in a statement?
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:29:43
An overrated economist.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:36:53
It's sad, but it's not that important for the future of Bitcoin. Europe, USA, South America, Japan and China are the countries we have to monitor. If BTC becomes popular and legal in those countries, the others will follow. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:17:05


Sadly, there wasn't.

Of course there is a great oligarchy ruling this planet. No doubt about that. Central banks are controlled by **private** companies. The game is crooked.
With Bitcoin you can't cheat. It is not a paradise, but it's a start.
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:55:00
Like I said, that was just an idea. It doesn't need to be a US only thing. Could be a Europe only giveaway, for instance. Or an international giveaway. I just think that we need to target people who can prove to be what they claim to be (students, scientist, teachers, artists etc.).

I bought some BTC at 900$. They are still in my wallet, and they are going to stay there for a long time. Not going to sell my BTC.

So we should beg an authoritarian and censorship-oriented company who sells overpriced products to please allow Bitcoin wallets on the iPhone? It's Apple that needs Bitcoin, not the other way around.  Let's regroup and stop buying their products.

@_date: 2014-07-15 12:28:45


Well he wrote that Bitcoin is *evil*, so what would you expect from this community?
Apparently you didn't read the article I posted. He was dead wrong about so many things as far as the financial crisis is concerned.
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:44:16
I was surprised myself.
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:56:55


If. Right now sharing a public key will not I repeat NOT weaken security. Period.


bitID removes the need to use email/password credentials. It just asks you to prove you own a bitcoin address.

So true. Bitcoin is a Darwinian creature: "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change".

What about BitPay, Bitstamp, Btc-e, KncMiner and many other healthy companies? And what about the Bitcoin network itself?
People are concerned because Bitcoin is a new technology. There is a simple explanation for all the FUD: fear of change.
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:08:33
Good luck with that, sir.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:48:32
Actually I read quite a few articles on that blog. Austrian school, and not one of the best examples. Definitely not interested.

[There are 250k+ computers in every country on earth, working together to transact bitcoin. They don't give a fuck what the price is today.](
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:49:29
I call "unconfirmed transactions" those transactions that will never be confirmed. A transaction waiting for its first confirmation is not an unconfirmed transaction. Cause it's just waiting in line. Correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:50:29
He comes out like a preachy fanatic though. Not sure if it's a good thing for BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:14:19
It's not always like that. Most immigrants coming from Africa to Europe pay thousand of euros to get there. Up to 8000 euros sometimes. Sounds preposterous but it's happening every day.
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:24:43
True. But we won't have that until the price stabilizes. And price volatility will gradually disappear as soon as bitcoin becomes widely accepted. So we are running in circles here.
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:03:10
Nobody will ever know. Simple as that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:55:58
I agree with you. I don't even like the expression "Bitcoin evangelist" because of its religious implications. No Bitcoinology. No Bitcoinism. Just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:30:14
I know what this guy did for the Bitcoin community and I know that we all make mistakes. And I still respect him just because I think he made a silly mistake and he had no bad intentions. Now, please, shut the fuck up.

Check out the YT comments. Facepalm.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:23:44
Absolutely. Market manipulation is done for a reason though (ie making more money). Also positive and negative news do influence BTC price to a certain degree. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:52:07
Oh man. I was waiting so desperately for such a smart comment. I stand in awe of your superior intelligence.

I love it. That's the spirit.
@_date: 2014-08-04 21:22:12
It's an experiment, so yes there is a risk involved. But the same happens with LeagueSafe: if people refuse to vote nobody gets the funds. 
As for me holding more than one account and more than one signature, yes I think it's possible too. And again the same it's true for LeagueSafe. That's why I would like someone else to take care of the multisignature aspect of the thing.
Anyway I think we are not going to fill this league. We still have 8 spots left :)

What do you expect from them? They are trying to achieve monopoly in IT and monopolists do not like innovation unless it comes from them.
I never bought any Apple products and I think that every one of us bitcoiners should do the same.
They declared war against Bitcoin, so it's time for the Bitcoin community to fight back. Let's start a new "boycott Apple" thread. 
Good news is: we are not alone.

The hoarders party scares me. So tell me, how are you going to obtain widespread adoption if you don't spend? Do you realize what will happen to the BTC price if sites like Overstock, Tigerdirect etc will choose to stop accepting BTC in the near future? You are hoarding dust, ztsmart.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:47:51
Where are those Overstock-doesn't-even-keep-its-bitcoins guys now? I can't hear them.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:00:52
I know. 
But saying: "It's BTC. It goes up and down. Get used to it" sounds simplistic to me. Yeah it goes up and down, still there is always a reason behind this. Even if we can't know it.
Talking about it has a therapeutic effect for me I guess ;)

4) It is a global currency

In the extreme case of a global ban (which is highly unlikely), I would say that surviving in the deepweb is a great achievement.

It depends on what kind of investment you are talking about. Between stock investments and gambling there is a huge difference. When you gamble you either win or lose everything. When you buy a stock, you decide how much you wanna earn or lose, because you can sell your stocks whenever you want. Big big difference.

The 7 wonders of Bitcoin:
* A completely decentralized financial network
* Which allows instant transfers of money, anywhere in the world
* At extremely low fees
* With a higher degree of transparency
* And with a higher degree of anonymity if compared to Paypal, CC or traditional money transfers
* Through an open source software
* Which connects you to an amazing community of people
BTC rocks.

I think it's a bad idea. Violence=Bitcoin. Not to mention that UFC is only popular in the US.
We need to take a different approach in my opinion.
We could, for instance, buy a WSJ or FT page (should be fun watching Bitcoin in such a context).
Or rent a boat for a month, decorate it and let it navigate the entire length of the Mississippi river (and call it something like the BitBoat. Newspapers love this kind of stuff).
There are so many things that are more colorful and fun than a fight.

Because it would be CENTRALIZED and therefore open to manipulation?
The thing about Bitcoin that you don't seem to grasp (or you don't want to grasp), is that it is a PUBLIC ledger, meaning that anybody can check and verify its integrity. And why is that? Because there is a network of thousands of people competing with each other to get some bitcoins.
There is no way around this.

You have to think of BTC as gold. Would you use gold to buy things? If you really need to, you probably would, but in general you tend to use it as store of value.
That being said, nothing prevented gold from being used as the main world currency for thousands of years.

@_date: 2018-03-03 01:27:08
Fully agreed. When I said that "listening nodes" help decentralization I also added "indirectly" (because they still keep a copy of the ledger). But you are absolutely on point about full nodes being the backbone of ledger immutability.

PoW change, you are at it again lol You are being ridiculous. A PoW change will send BTC to the bottom of coinmarketcap. And you will be the first one to sell.
You keep pushing this new narrative about nodes being the most important aspect of BTC (which I partially agree to like I asaid multiple times) but I have been part of this community long enough to know that hashing power comes first. 
All the power nodes have depend on the hashing power. Nobody will ever run a node or validate transaction if nobody mines BTC. Both are essential but there has to be the need to mine BTC in the first place. 
Now get lost please, I have no time for your nonsense.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:40:55


Sounds like a stretch, but I get what you mean.

I like the way you think, sir. Good points.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:16:35
Can't say you are wrong, although strictly speaking hashing power is what makes the network more secure.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:41:43
BOTH are essential to the system. But there has to be a need to mine BTC first. The BTC network started because Satoshi mined the first block. Mining process always comes first. Doesn't mean that miners control BTC though. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:03:04

@_date: 2018-03-02 21:57:30
Absolutely and thanks for posting this. Although it's true that if you don't mine you are not helping secure the network, I still think that an increasing number of "listening" nodes is a positive thing for Bitcoin. Helps immutability of the ledger (indirectly helping decentralization) and improves latency (not a big deal but still better than nothing). But yeah you are right.

Sure. With zero consequences on BTC price ofc. If something like that happens, BTC price would collapse (and in turn miners would leave, hashing power would crash, and other coins would explode in price and popularity).

The fact that you don't even spot the Satoshi's quote should speak for itself.  I don't have to prove to you that hashing power is indeed the most important factor in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-02-14 17:13:00
During the dotcom bubble in the late 90s early 2000s many companies were valued way beyond their real value (which was extremely low tbh). So based on your assumption ("Value is literally represented by price") we should infer that those companies had a high utility value for our society during the 90s. But that's easily disprovable since we all know now it was all greed and speculation, and infact most of them except Google, ebay, amazon and few others collapsed. Sentiment is the main driving force  on the markets and stock prices and market cap do not always represent the real value and/or utility value of a company.

I honestly think that this sub should do a better job in informing people about what ETH effectively is. You sir have done an excellent job though.

Wrong. CDs are financial products, not instruments. An instrument generally refers to a bond, stock, derivative, etc that can be bought or sold or transferred.  There must be a market. A financial product is  an account (checking, brokerage, loan, card) or a service provided to the bank's customer.

It's still early. At the moment Bitcoin is neither legal nor illegal in most coutries. It will eventually be banned in some countries IMO, but there is no way Bitcoin can be made illegal in every single country on this planet. 
Also you don't consider this. Most regulators might seem stupid to us, but they know that making BTC "illegal" won't solve any issue and could potentially make it even stronger (public opinion is always a concern for them).
If you ask me, there are better ways to make bitcoin fail, than to make it illegal.

It's just an assumption. We actually don't know how the Bitcoin ecosystem will react to a) a blocksize increase b) lighting network and off-chain solutions. It's uncharted territory IMO.


I also have problem with this tbh. Because you seem to ignore the fact that second layer solutions like the LN will still be heavily dependant on the Bitcoin base layer. You will still need two transactions on the main layer to first open and then close a payment channel. That's why I would be more worried about the blocksize limit of the Bitcoin main layer when LN will be implemented. With a huge adoption rate you will still need to increase the blocksize limit, but at that point every increase on the main chain will have an exponential impact over the whole system. And I think core devs are perfectly aware of this.

Fully agree with you. Also, in general there is no need  to even consider discussing a topic with guys who deny facts and ignore logic. You just have to make fun of them, provided you have some free time to waste.

They clearly have no idea what they are talking about but "AI" and "blockchain" in the same sentence make them look cool I guess. Politicians.

They can't stop people from getting bitcoins if they really want to. It's a P2P technology. They can make it difficult for you to buy, but they cannot prevent you from buying.

Go to the police now then. Don't lose time posting shit on reddit, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. You have a phone number so they might be able to identify him. Also consider hiring a private detective (tbh that's what I would do). You can still find the scammer, don't lose hope and good luck.

I apologize but sometimes this sub is full of trolls, hence we are all pretty suspicious here :D 
I would also add that in 2020 there will be a fourth halving. That means that in 2020 miners won't get 12.5 every 10 mins on average, only 6.25. 
Good luck

True that. I think they also said that BTC miners "get rewarded" at random (which is technically wrong). A little oversimplified, but great for new users.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:12:02
No chart, I see. The fact that you can buy something doesn't mean There is a market. I can buy spoons, but strange as it seems I can't find an historical chart about that. 
Every fucking thing that grows in price is subject to price corrections. You are just trying to get attention.

That page is far from being accurate though. For instance they deem Bitcoin "legal" in Portugal because "Bitcoin has no specific legal framework in Portugal" :-D
In Kyrgyzstan they deem Bitcoin "illegal" because "the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic made clear that the use of 'virtual currency', bitcoins, in particular, as a means of payment in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a violation of the law of our state."
So yeah some countries already made clear that they don't like Bitcoin (especially through National Banks' statements), but those are just statements, not laws. Big difference.
Still, you are right. Ecuador officially banned Bitcoin. I forgot that they wanted to push their ridiculous state-run electronic money system.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:19:11
Yeah, it was clearly a typo. I meant 50, not 5. Fully agree with you. This sounds like the "Argentinians are going crazy for bitcoins" narrative somebody was trying to feed us a few years ago.

Not so sure about this. People who will join in let's say 2-6 years will have neither the technical ability to run a full node nor a financial benefit in running it. I would go as far as to say that 95%-99% of the late adopters won't run a node and won't even know what a node is.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:15:09
Bitcoin as a system is not anonymous. You can still manage to reach some form of anonymity, but if the FBI wants to find you based on your transaction records, they will find you.

"This thing [Bitcoin] does not make sense. It's unregulated. It's not under the control of the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other central bank"
Yes, that was precisely the idea behind it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:11:11
Wrong assumptions. Why does the 10% of $31 trillions in stock value automatically translate into crypto market cap? Doesn't make sense, sorry. It's apples to oranges.

Agreed. It's not even deflationary at this moment. It will be eventually, but it's still not deflationary since we inject into the system 12.5 coins every 10 mins on average.

This guy has no clue. He even admits it himself  when he says that the first reason he doesn't invest in Bitcoin is because "I don't understand it" lol
Bitcoin is not ONLY a currency or a payment system. But I suggest you to do more research before investing in BTC anyway.

You got it backwards. Governments are here to protect those privileges bankers acquired centuries ago. Banks predate modern states and governments.
