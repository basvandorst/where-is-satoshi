Different markets trade at different prices, which explains the price difference.
Also, you can sell your bitcoin on coinbase.
You will likely lose whatever profit there is to make in transferring from coinbase to btcmarket because of transaction/mining fees.

It's going to be awhile.  It is taking a long time for people to adopt segwit.  There's still no date for when Lightning Network will be ready, and even when it is ready adoption will take time.

Well he has to now lel

Pretty much everyone in the crypto space is aware of bitcoin's issues (which may be some time before they're fixed). Also, everyone is aware of how large Ethereum has grown; countless other coins, MANY with very sizable market caps, exist on the Ethereum blockchain.
I think we might see a flip in rank soon.

Never get worried! There's no way you could lose all your money, and its impossible that selling now is a smart move! HODL friend!

If you can stand to wait, id wait for a drop in price. But it's only speculation that the price will drop, so who knows haha.
What do you mean, is it worth it? It sounds like you're coming in with the mentality that bitcoin is a money grab, and everyone is here to multiply their money. Bitcoin is a new form of currency - if you believe in the idea, then getting involved is worth it regardless of the dollar/btc rate.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:34:49
All the "whales" who are holding hundreds or thousands of bitcoin decide to sell out for millions (or billions...) of dollars. (Wouldn't you be tempted to do the same?)
The price of btc plummets as the market saturates. 99% of people lose their money.
Bitcoin is labeled by the public as a ponzi scheme (not totally an unfair evaluation as of now, it has some matching elements...)
The public loses confidence in bitcoin, and there aren't enough buyers anymore to raise the price again.  Another digital currency takes its place.

Could you not trade btc-&gt;ltc on one, send ltc to other, then trade ltc-&gt;btc?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:10
Not sure which part of my post you're countering - obviously the currency is deflating. I'm not sure how that proves anything, other than more and more people are trying to join the ranks of bitcoin holders.
If all those people were buying bitcoin because they believed in its cause, it might be more sustainable. But I think most are just trying to make money (fiat, that is).
There's no denying that if the tiny minority of people holding the vast majority of btc (the tip of the pyramid) decided to cash in, it would decimate the market. I don't know if I'm willing to trust that tiny minority not to do that.

You could I suppose, but fees and transaction times would be pretty rough...
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:28:38
Why on earth would you transfer 8 btc to a coinbase wallet...
I would call coinbase support and get it figured out. Especially if there's $88,000 on the line.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:06:19
Apparently having multiple wallets is not secure. Specifically I've heard that keeping your btc in a wallet that has never been "spent" from is the most secure. Apparently some piece data revealed when transferring bitcoin can potentially increase a hackers odds of gaining access.

We need a crystal_ball_bot haha.
What if it rises to 20 or 30k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:50
Ahhh I see - I was blind to the idea of just having money on BOTH exchanges at the same time haha.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:02:59
Assuming they didn't leave their keys to anyone, their bitcoin would be lost forever. And there would be deflation in response to the decreased supply of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:31:31
Old news my man
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:12:43
The days of personal mining are long gone.
You can buy and trade bitcoin through a large number of exchanges. Try google.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:27
That's bizzare, wish I could have seen that
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:10:29
The transaction times have been pretty awful for some time now - I haven't done any recent transfers myself, but it looks like they are taking many hours or even full days, depending on how much you pay. More than enough time for the winds of profit to change direction. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:10:11
Seriously haha. Wait for the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:14:17
That's a good point - we may be at a critical mass where any dip in price will be immediately countered by mass purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:06
I love this idea haha.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:33:28
I agree, it would make more sense for whales to "slow burn" their btc. If it works out that way, we will likely see the price of btc stabilize as the wealth concentration dissolves and the fear of a sudden crash decreases.
But OP was asking how MIGHT bitcoin fail, so I was suggesting panicking (or co-conspiring) whales as a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:47:22
Good point - though there is a difference between saying "I know this market will crash" and "I know WHEN this market will crash"

Best advice: don't. There are highly experienced trade firms using sophisticated software and sub-milisecond connections to the exchange servers which will outrade the average Joe all day, every day.  You will probably make good calls sometimes, but on average you are far more likely to lose money.
With that said, try GDAX. You can log in with your Coinbase info. Learn how to set limit and stop orders instead of market buys, so that you aren't paying fees on every transaction. Also realize that every time you exchange for USD, you are realizing capital gains and owe taxes on the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:28:10
The words no one wants to hear haha.  I agree with you though. I'm just putting in a little bit of money every month, and doing a little trading on GDAX when i see an obvious opportunity to turn a small.

Not sure about the solution, but I'm sure glad you posted this - never thought about this possible issue before.
I imagine, even with that low fee, it should take less than 48hr?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:12:44
I don't understand why you made this post - did you think your profile wouldn't be scrutinized?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:09:29
I think that's a smart move right now, especially since they are still sub-$100.
I might be wrong but i think LTC is meant to coexist with - rather than compete with - BTC. It's like silver to gold - more plentiful and less valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:01:14
From what I've seen/read, all the major ones are pretty outstanding. Going with the Trezor myself.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:40:24
I mean you aren't wrong...
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:56:44
The idea (I think) is that nice round numbers like "10k" is a lot of people's predecided selling points. So when it hits 10k many will sell, lowering the value. The decreasing value will cause others to panic sell. Then it will stabilize and start rising again.
