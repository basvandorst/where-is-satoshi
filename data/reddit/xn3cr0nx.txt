Think about fees, if you buy on coinbase you will lose a lot of money day by day

I think it will be used from any kind of people in the future but it isn't so easy to use yet to be mainstream. The buy process is still difficult, once it will be possible to anyone to buy btc will go to the moon

I buy from coinmama, fees are a little high, but you can buy a lot more than coinbase, where the initial limit is 325€. On coinmama you have 10000€ limit. The registration process is the same. The diffrence is that coinmama isn't a wallet so can't keep your bitcoins. You should have a wallet, as electrum, or I use bitcoin.com wallet where to send the bitcoins that you buy.

It really surprised me that RL is based just on a MLP with just an hidden layer. Is it possible to obtain these results just with optimizers of that model?

What they say about ICOs and "crowdsale" are lies. Anyway this photo is true, that's why now investors are looking for solid business, not just idea, in this way you can think about doing an ICO. But you need more to raise money.
