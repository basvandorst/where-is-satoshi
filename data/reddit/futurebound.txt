Regardless of whether you agree that a blockchain is a data structure of blocks and hash pointers to previous blocks or a data structure + methods for consensus and validation, my entire point was that there's many different protocols/blockchains that are separate from Bitcoin.  I simply don't agree that Bitcoin is the internet of money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:11:04
I agree with that.  Bitcoin will always hold a place in my heart. But BTC != altcoins.

More than one protocol can result in a blockchain.  It isn't a single protocol called Blockchain or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:36:10
How can you say that Bitcoin is the internet of money?  So far Bitcoin is only money on the internet.  There's altcoins that are far closer to resembling an internet of money.

I think you need to look at the context of our conversation or do some research.  There's many blockchains in existence that are not tied to Bitcoin's blockchain or network.

A blockchain isn't a protocol, it's a data structure.  Some protocols make use of blockchains but that doesn't make them all the same protocol.  They are all different protocols and have different native tokens.

We may actually reach a point where genetic evolution is largely irrelevant due to engineering.  Hence the power of the conscious mind and the ability to pass information between them.

Yet without appliances/killer-apps electricity is pretty useless.  The electrical grid is just a network and protocol for controlling the flow of electrons.  People want to adopt the applications not the underlying protocol that makes them possible. 
Bitcoin is a network and protocol that enables trustless exchange of any amount of value over any distance. You could also look at it as a protocol that tracks ownership of finite units. That's is all it is.  What we can use it for beyond the simplest form of peer to peer exchange is up to the imagination of the innovators.  I can visualize many uses for this, including an obvious use case for remittances.  But it's also possible that I'm delusional, like you say.

Fair enough.  However, I imagine the price would factor the new supply in quite quickly since the Bitcoin protocol is transparent.  Also, the fact that users could no longer trust the supply to be predictable would be pretty detrimental.  Any short term gain would hardly make up for the cost of mining equipment.

Yes, but you can't simply add all the material things up to find the value of a company.  There's many intangible and subjective variables.
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:50:31
The value of $1 is relative to the value of other things.  The value fluctuates with perception.  The dollar has not had a stable value relative to other things over the course of history.  
If I'm selling washing machines the value of the washing machines != the value of the metal that makes them.  Value is greater than the parts of the whole and is always subjective.  You can't just look at all the material things that a company owns to assess value.
Edit: Buffet quote: “If you need to use a computer or a calculator to make the calculation, you shouldn’t buy it.”  If not by math then how does Buffett gauge value?  I bet it's a mix of subjective logic and intuition.

The problem is, how do you incentivize people to move to the inflationary currency without forcing it upon them?  The currency needs a significantly large "market cap".
EDIT: It's impossible to make ~~~~prices~~~~  value completely stable because value is always relative to other things of value.  You could pin the price to a fiat currency like the US dollar, but that removes the independence factor of the cryptocurrency.

I think it would be interesting to see if you could inflate the supply a set amount for every person that enters.  I'm not sure how you would do it though.  One problem that Bitcoin supposedly solves that a traditional deflationary currency like gold has is divisibility, so supply may never be an issue.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:40:17
The blockchain is the big innovation behind Bitcoin.   It enables a trusted consensus among nodes on a network.  It allows trust without a third party.  It allows proof of ownership to be established from one point to another anywhere in the world. It's thought to solve this 
 
Value can be transferred anywhere in the world in minutes instead of days.  Clearing houses and other steps in the traditional financial network cost time and money.
Currency can also be programmed to "behave" in ways that weren't possible before.  Ex. Multisig transactions, timed transactions, condition specific escrows, and the list goes on.
But the implications of the blockchain go beyond just currency and that's why we're so excited.

They were right about deflation being destructive but only within systems of credit created money.   When trust in the credit system falls then people panic and demand "hard"  money or the "sovereign's"  money.  If the demands aren't quenched then the problem exacerbates.  
Bitcoin is the sovereign in our case and we could easily create economies based on credit on top of Bitcoin via fractional reserve banking.   If we create systems based on trust we'll be right back where we started.

I *believe* that both inflationary and deflationary currencies are viable.  Society has used both successfully.  It may be a matter of personal preference.  Do you prefer an economy that leans towards spending or saving? I don't believe there's a right answer.  I personally prefer the value of my currency to go up over time.
If you were free to use and pay taxes with any currency you like,  would you use an inflationary currency or a deflationary currency?  I think if the choice were completely voluntary and you could not force others to use the inflationary currency, then the rational choice would be to use the deflationary currency.  
However, you may think the advantages of forcing people to use an inflationary currency are worth removing freedom of choice.  To this I disagree, but I respect your opinion.

I can agree with this.  But in the hypothetical situation that there were two currencies and all other properties held equal between the two. Except, one is deflationary and one inflationary.  I think it makes sense that the majority would choose the deflationary one.

I read an article on flipboard while bored at work during the April '13 bubble.  A few years prior to this I had read a futurist's (wish I could recall the source)  blog about the future structure of governments/society/currency/etc. Within this blog the author described something akin to digital currencies.  
Bitcoin reminded me of that blog, lightbulbs switched on, and I've been been hooked ever since.  I bought my first coin around $60 near the bottom of the April bubble.  
Bitcoin also inspired me to go back to school for computer engineering.

I'm not a computer scientist, so I'll leave the technical aspects to the experts.   But, intuitively competitive exclusion does seem to be a concern.  
Mining is one aspect where we have to trust people to some degree.  Even if that trust is aligned with economic incentive it is still trust in individuals.  Any time we have to trust individuals instead of the network protocol, it appears to be a weak link.  I would like and hope to see a fail-safe written in code that solves this problem.

At first I was excited about the potential of an ETF, but I prefer to see money come in from people who are forced to learn how to use and learn to appreciation Bitcoin.  I want to see real growth.  With an ETF we risk bubble territory of proportions we've never seen before.  While that sounds exciting, there's also the risk of a severe crash with much more money at stake. That could leave the world with a bad taste of Bitcoin.

BEIJING—Chinese demand has helped fuel a boom in the virtual currency called bitcoin. But even as prices reach new highs, Li Xiaolai says he won't sell.
Mr. Li, 41 years old, is one of China's biggest bitcoin holders, according to a fledging community of bitcoin watchers in Beijing. The former English test-prep teacher won't disclose specifics but says his bitcoin holdings are "in the six figures with the first figure being one." With bitcoin prices soaring to around $1,000 each, that makes his stake worth more than $100 million.
"It's the first time China can lead the world," says Mr. Li, who cites local innovations in chips, web applications and other parts of the bitcoin ecosystem.
China has become increasingly important to the fate of the four-year-old currency, which isn't backed by any central bank and is created through a complicated computing process called mining. BTC China, the country's biggest bitcoin exchange, in the last 30 days averaged 64,000 bitcoin in daily trading volume, according to BTC China Chief Executive Bobby Lee.
Over that period, the exchange accounted for more than one-third of volume world-wide, up from about 20% over the past six months, according to industry tracker Bitcoinity. In November, the price on BTC China jumped four-fold, hitting a record for the exchange of 7,395 yuan, or $1,214, on Dec. 1.
Attention to bitcoin in the Chinese media has drawn a number of amateur investors into the market. "Our generation doesn't have enough money to invest in property and I don't understand economics well enough to invest in the stock market," says Xiong Bin, 33, the manager of a beauty salon in China's southern Guangxi region. Mr. Xiong says he started buying in mid-November and now has less than 40,000 yuan (about $6,600) in the market. "I am grateful for the media coverage," he says, because it allowed him to learn about the currency.
The growth of interest from China is increasingly cited as a reason for the soaring prices, but the actual impact of Chinese demand is difficult to measure. Kacper Ciesla, founder of Bitcoinity, says trading volume on BTC China went up significantly after the exchange removed trading fees.
"Soon after that we had a [global] bitcoin price run up," Mr. Ciesla said via email.
The question for many is how China's role in the market will evolve.
China keeps a firm grip on its currency, the yuan, as well as capital flows inside and outside the country, raising questions about whether it would approve of a virtual currency that can be easily transferred via the Internet and converted. Beijing has moved to clamp down on virtual currencies in the past, with a 2009 statement prohibiting their use to buy "real goods and services." That put an end to QQ coins, a virtual currency distributed by Chinese Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY +0.11%
Last month, People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Yi Gang said that China won't recognize bitcoin for now, but suggested authorities will tolerate the currency for the present. "If you want to take the risk—and remember that prices rise and fall—it's your business," he told a financial seminar.
The bitcoin market is so "sporadic" at the moment that China doesn't know how it will pan out, leading authorities to choose to wait and watch "what the U.S. is doing," says David Kiang, former chief executive of domestic bank First Sino Bank, who doesn't own any bitcoin. If the market grows to a "significant" volume, "it will be hard for China to accept," he says.
Volatility is another issue. China's newfound wealth has hit up against government investment restrictions in recent years, contributing to a number of booms and busts. Its main stock-market index is at less than half the high it reached in 2007. Other assets that have seen quick run-ups and retreats include coins, tea, ginseng and even caterpillar fungus, which in Chinese medicine is believed to help male virility. Meanwhile, property, a main savings vehicle, has shot up in price and is out of reach for many.
This week, Chinese authorities said they detained three people who they alleged had operated a bitcoin-trading platform called Global Bond Ltd. but shut it down, cheating investors of their money. The platform didn't get the proper licenses to operate in its home in Hong Kong, the authorities said. Phone numbers listed on Global Bond's incorporation documents rang unanswered.
One investor was Xu Yuanda, a 19-year old from Jiangsu province, in eastern China, who says that he sank what was worth more than 12,000 yuan of bitcoin into the site before getting out with 4,000 yuan in September. He says he has moved on to buying other virtual currencies, adding that his holdings there have more than tripled recently. He hasn't sold yet, he says, but plans "short-term trading."
Many who have bet on bitcoin in China acknowledge the short-term speculation even as they stress the currency's longer-term prospects. Ron Cao, managing director of Lightspeed China Partners, a venture-capital firm that invested $5 million in BTC China, says he would rather see "a healthier price increase" than bitcoin's recent spectacular rise.
BTC China's Mr. Lee says that the exchange's studies show "the vast majority [on BTC China] are buying bitcoin for investment purposes, hoping that prices will go up in the long term." Bitcoin faces a "bumpy ride" as its circulation value increases, he says.
Bitcoin investors in China say they are aware of the risks, including the lack of a public discussion by top officials on whether, and how, the currency should be regulated.
"At least in the U.S., they are acknowledging it," says Long Yujiang, a 25-year old Chinese from the southwestern city of Chengdu, who says his bitcoin are worth roughly $200 million at current prices. Last month, the U.S. Senate held hearings on virtual currencies, including testimony from senior law-enforcement and regulatory officials.
Mr. Long, who sells flight-simulation equipment, moonlights as a seller of bitcoin mining machines but plans to sell them only in the U.S., where he says the industry will be "better protected."
Many of China's top bitcoin evangelists have ties to the country's burgeoning start-up culture, which has been bolstered by the spread of smartphones and the success of app developers. Mr. Li, the former teacher, frequents Beijing's Garage Café, which serves coffee but also offers incubator space for entrepreneurs. It is one of the few places in China that accept bitcoin as payment.
On a recent afternoon, a number of Chinese discussed their various bitcoin projects in back rooms while huddled over laptops. In the main café area, a person on stage with a microphone gave a talk on bitcoin.
Mr. Li, a two-pack-a-day smoker, taps his teaching background when talking about bitcoin, with animated lectures punctuated with diagrams he draws on a whiteboard. He has invested some of his bitcoin in ventures related to the currency, including one that would offer savings accounts and pay interest in bitcoin.
Some of the most innovative work, he says, comes from Chinese developers making chips for bitcoin miners. People in China "can see all these things that Americans can only imagine," he said.
He first learned about bitcoin from an article in 2011, while working for New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. EDU +0.27% Mr. Li bought Apple shares using dollars he raised by selling stock in the Chinese education company after its U.S. initial public offering, only to cash out again. This time, he bought $12,000 worth of bitcoin on the Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox.
Bitcoin aside, Mr. Li says he mostly lives off of 50,000 yuan per year in after-tax income from royalties, mainly for test-prep books. "I don't spend much," he says. "I thought China's property prices are too high so I never bought a house."

I didn't realize it was so simple to add RAM to a laptop. Good idea.  Haven't built a PC since high school.
Edit: Just opened RAM compartment, there's already two sticks of 2 GB in there. However, I think it shows up as &lt;4 GB (3...something GB) under system specs.

My first thought was a small device that has a QR reader, a wi-fi receiver, light-weight wallet software (something that doesn't download the whole ledger), and the ability to interchange wallets (sim card-like wallets).  You could use one card as a saving account and another as an "on-the-go" wallet. 
Maybe upon inserting a wallet card into the device you will be prompted for a primary password, then transactions can be confirmed using a simple 3-4 character pin.
I don't know, I'm just a biology major. That's just my intuition.

You make a valid point.  The invention of the printing press I believe enabled the transition from a monarch to a republic.  The faster information flows the more people can be involved in decision making processes.  The invention of the internet I believe will enable a transition to an even more democratic state.  
Experts are always important to any decision making process.  I don't think it will be designed in a matter as simple a poll for killing people or lowing taxes.  I think reddit shows some hints of characteristics of what a future democracy may look like.  We may be able to make visible an important opinion or idea of an expert which can be further validated by the opinions and ideas of other experts.  The internet then enables others to research and further validate these opinions.  
I don't have an exact mechanism laid out and no democracy is a perfect democracy.  But I have a strong feeling that this is the direction that society is heading. 
Republics are simply too slow and inefficient for the internet age.  The inside lag of governments can't keep up with innovation.

Armory keeps crashing now after I load the transaction history. If I run it again it takes about the same amount of time to load. Maybe a RAM issue? I barely meet the requirements.
Also, if if I switch clients can I import a wallet created by Armory? I may not be able to run Armory.

At this point I just see Facebook as being more conservative.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:36:01
Bitcoin isn't some sort of government entity. It's more like a big, open source, crowdfunded, decentralized corporation experiment. There are no rules saying that the lead dev of the Bitcoin client can't work with devs of other Bitcoin projects.  It may actually help streamline innovation and bring Bitcoin closer to that "killer app".
If your afraid that power is becoming too centralized then start your own Bitcoin projects and organizations or stop whining.  This is a free market and the software is open source. Nothing is stopping you but a lot of hard work.

Some will sell in the early days of Bitcoin.  But, as goods and services begin to accept Bitcoin the incentive to keep money in the form of Bitcoin by both consumers and business will rise. If I keep my money in the form of Bitcoins I will not be subject to capital gains tax and thus I will have more buying power.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:12:14
Bubbles are entirely subjective. Nobody knows where we're at or where we're going to be.
Any one who claims differently is speculating.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:42:28
Gold is impractical to buy anything with in the 21st century.  It's not easily divisible and you can't send it through the internet.  People use to buy lots of stuff with gold.  In fact it was once written in the U.S. constitution that all legal tender must be backed by gold.
Bitcoin doesn't have to become the main currency that everyone uses.  It can succeed in a number of ways, such as being a payment system (different than a currency).  If it succeeds in other ways, holding a Bitcoin will be like holding a "share" of the industry. It just so happens that you won't necessarily have to liquidate that share to fiat currency in order to spend it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:55:37

Premature. I ain't heard no fat lady.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:46:50
In the early days of Bitcoin hoarding can be seen as a necessary thing.  There must be an incentive to adopt a new currency and that incentive is value. Once the value of the Bitcoin is high enough (many more people have bought into them) then a market for goods and services will spawn around it. Until then it will mainly be an investment.
That's the way I see it anyways.

Well all of my favorite ideas thus far have probably been cell phone apps.  My mechanical engineering friend and I drew up a cell phone app and it looked something like a primitive version of one of those UML charts.
There's a lot of flow charts and positive/negative feedback loops in biology.  It may be similar then.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:23:07
The problem that I have is that I guy can claim that he called the bubble whether Bitcoin loses 50% of it's value at $800 or $40,000.  It's really a chicken shit thing to call. 
Nobody knows the intrinsic value. 
Also, since it's a currency, how do you differentiate between speculating or storing value?  Since I own Bitcoins do I have to be speculating? Am I speculating when I hold dollars instead?

I think 1 trillion is a reasonable number, but you may also see the money multiplier effect diminish somewhat as dollars are traded for Bitcoin.  This could ultimately mean a significantly smaller cap.

A platform that takes the best of the best of what Bitcoin has to offer and places them together in a convenient and user-friendly way.  The *Steam* of Bitcoin.
Think of old people, computer-illiterate people, and console gamers (versus avg. pc-gamer).  Most people need everything all in once place and simplified.  People like the walled-off garden that their apple iphones provide them. There's a reason why windows 8 switched to a smartphone/tablet style start screen.
The internet browser looks scary to most folks nowadays.  There needs to be a nice safe place for users to go for everything. Bitcoin client, exchange, marketplace, news, and forums all-in-one.

So, what would provide more of the theory without getting to deep into the practice?
Making something sounds pretty cool though.  I'd like to try and if I don't like it I don't like.  I website maybe, but isn't that mostly javascript and html?  I'm open to ideas.
Is it possible to make anything of practical personal use with a couple years knowledge?  If not, would I at least be able to "speak" enough of the lingo with developers to get my idea/points across? I find that people respect you more if you can speak their language.
My friends works on cars as his hobby, but he's not an expert and he takes his car to the experts for anything serious.  But, since he knows enough about what's going on he can protect himself financially and lead them to the problem.  Is this a good analogy?

I would be ecstatic if it reached $8333 per coin and it's really not that unreasonable to think it could go there. 1 Million a coin? Maybe in many many years due to inflation of fiat, but I don't see it at today's purchasing power. Anyways, the idea is to have competing currencies not another monopoly currency that takes over the whole market.
