Still the same error message

As I said in the other subreddit, no one is guaranteed anything. I am HODLING, sell it at any price you feel comfortable with or sell a part at each price point (dollar cost averaging your profit/loss), I just found the story interesting and relevant

That’s like saying why can’t USD or EURO be used globally, logically makes sense but logistically not gonna happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:31:26
I am waiting for the MtGox sell off to buy more

Except the transactions give him Bitconnect instead of Bitcoins
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:51:44
So you sold your coins and now troll these forums? GTFO
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:30:13

It is going to, similar to China. This is the first step.

Price: why is a Bitcoin worth 4000$? Why isn’t a Bitcoin worth $2000? $100? Because supply and demand. Why is Gold worth $1500?
What can make a Bitcoin worth $5000? More demand
What is stabilizing the Bitcoin market? Is it stable? Bitcoin is volatile
Who owns the most Bitcoins and how many? What happened if they sell all of them? Satoshi Nakamoto, $6Billion, Price will drop duh...

It can take up to 5 business days. I am a coinbase user with no issues.

A whole bunch of South Koreans are talking about it through tweets and Korean communities. Read up.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:08:35
Yup ;-)

They could ban Bitcoin mining and kill a huge number of nodes/hash power
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:37:24
It'll be a 100+ years before all BTC can be mined. Lost keys are lost forever, good for the price. Nobody can recover them. What happens when you die, does your family know how to cash in your BTCs? hypothetically, but what if?

Best time to buy: 2010, Second best time to buy: now
