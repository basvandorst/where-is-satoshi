It means FOMO in baby.

Their agenda is to make an entertaining show. There's no conspiracy. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:37:27
They're stealth. They don't need a website to impress anyone. They're already doing the work. Whether this is good or bad time will tell.

Noticed they do NOT like to advertise Coinbase on the site.

Thanks for a great reply! Great!

Rofl what are you smoking son? I don't want it.

This is not bullish.

Only a matter of time before we got Goatse'd.

Of course you would. It benefits you. But I don't think it benefits the service provider. That's what I'm saying.

I agree. But it doesn't need to be BTC. It just needs to be Crypto in general. Anything with liquidity also so they can get out if needed. Obviously the one with the safest, highest liquidity is most valuable. But it doesn't need to be specifically BTC, to my chagrin. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:04:36
But why would they? That's not in the best interest of the service provider.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:11:25
No lol. This was a rumor started by one of my friends in SF. Ignore completely. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:32:37
I'd rather have 10% dominance and a $100k BTC. Keeping it as real as it gets. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:19:05
A lot of these "per minute" or "per word" or "per (unit)" suggestions do not benefit the service provider at all. A reason monthly subscriptions/contracts exists is for guaranteed stable payment. I'm not sure a service provider charging "per unit" is in their best interests. Meaning, I don't think they'll use Lightning or crypto for those reasons.

Interesting. I was watching it live and low and behold a rogue Goatse popped up and it was immediately pasted over by someone else. How is this possible? Does someone have an API to track Goatses?

I literally made a song about this 5 minutes before it happened!!!

No he doesn't. It says if no fork happens all users keep their coins.

If you can't beat them, join them.

How am I a "redditor for 3 months" when my post history has posts in it that are from last year..........what?
