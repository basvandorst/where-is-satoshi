I have an ocean cruising sailboat that I'd like to sell for BTC, valued at appx 40k USD. Are there any good bitcoin classifieds or listing agencies I could use?

Sorry, but you're proving my point. If you wanted to debate the articles in question seriously I'd be happy to discuss them with you. It's possible, depending on your stance, that I might agree we the you about their "relevance" or bias.  
  
But instead of debating them on their merits, you have immediatedly mischaracterized, straw manned, ad-hominemed , and siderailed to rant about the institutional guilt of wall street. 
  
Ironically, the next day I posted another article from the same working  group about the potential for crypto to bring accountability to the financial sector. Since this seems to be something you're passionate about, you might have read it with interest.  
  
My point was that I would like to see more reasoned discussion and argument, not frothing capital letter "d bag" attacks, as in your last post.

I checked and found this had been posted in some other subreddit, but surprisingly not here.

I have posted two scholarly journal articles on bitcoin written by economics professors in the past two days. One discussed evidence of price manipulation in the markets, and another was commentary on cryptocurrencies forcing improvements in other monetary spheres. . Not only did I not get upovoted, but I think I got down voted......  
  
Is there another forum where people can actually have a serious discussion? I'm getting sick of Reddit.

There's nothing inherently wrong with socialism, or capitalism for that matter. The problem is human corruption, ignorance, and greed. I think you are wrong to blame people that have been subjected to the abuses of governments for decades.

We will remember Ross. He is a a true martyr of our generation. He bravely used his intellect and insight to strive against the weight of the grotesque dogmas that have beset our society: the drug war, the culture of fear and powerlessness, the misconception that we as “free” citizens have no authority, responsibility, or autonomy to change the world around us.
Much ado has been made of his alleged crimes, from his architecture of the Silk Road,  to his attempts to kill his would be blackmailers, who turned out to be corrupt agents of the very government that he was defying. By threatening to release  the information of the entire Silk Road user base, they were endangering the lives of every person who had used the site, for the purposes of extortion and personal gain. Amid the complexity and ambiguity of the whole affair, it is nearly impossible for anyone but those few involved to know the full scope of everything that occurred. Even if all the allegations leveled at him were true, backed into a corner, it is not hard to see why Ross reacted the way he did.
He was human. He was flawed. Nonetheless, he dreamed of way to break the chains that have encumbered us all. Despite the risk to his own life and liberty, he acted. In spite of the consequences, he acted, trusting in his own belief in the truth and determined to make a positive impact on our society. Like every Prometheus before him, he carried a torch to share with his fellow man and light a way for the future. He is a true revolutionary figure of our time.
Any attempts to garner support for an otherwise inspiring figure have been stymied by the overt character assassination only possible in an environment of blatant hyperbole and shallow thinking. How many have been unjustly persecuted, imprisoned, and murdered in the “war on drugs”? It is in fact a war on our people, on minorities, on the proletariat. It has been, and continues to be a war on conscience, free thought, on our own autonomy as free individuals.
Will you, as supporters of democracy and liberty, stand for injustice? Do you believe that rich, powerful elites should dictate what is moral and what is just?
Do you support net neutrality? Do you believe that people should be able to think critically about important issues, without their worldview being dictated by whatever corporate entity “owns” the medium of communication?
Do you believe in the sanctity of the individual, the sacred right of people to choose for themselves what to eat, drink, and consume? Do you support women's right to control their own bodies? The right of responsible adults to enjoy the fruits of the earth in joy and recreation?
Do you support the ideals inherent in the Bitcoin protocol? Should centralized actors control and dictate your economic reality?
Do you believe in Liberty? Not as an abstract ideal, but as something real, something tangible, something accessible in your life? Is that something that is granted to you, by another individual? By the state? Or is it something that you take for yourself? To what extent will you strive to maintain it? Will you fight for it?
Would you ever risk your own freedom so that others might have it?
Ross, you are not forgotten.
