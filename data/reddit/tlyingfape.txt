correlation is not causation 
the pirate bay makes money
secondly, they have a distributed network of mirrors - that's not a possibility for an exchange

Well, the economy is collapsing not because of the war but because they don't share that money with the regular populace anymore.
Halliburton is part of the economy. Unfortunately, when Halliburton's CEO keeps most of his ludicrous paycheck, the money doesn't *flow*. It's definitely decoupled. Have you seen how the .01% live? To act as if they are in the same orbit of the same economy is nothing but hilarious

As relevant as the subsequent collapse of the global economy in such a situation?
good luck getting internet access to exchange your bitcoins in that situation.
And thanks for the strawman but I never suggested that the US is the 'richest' nation, or that it's wealth was related to it's ability to 'produce'
The threat of violence is such an old turd. Way lamer than the actual matrix of forces acting on the economy. It's so disingenuous to pretend it's *just* violence. The U.S. is a bankrupt turn being held together by the entire world because it sits at the center of EVERY economy (bitcoin included - LOL)
I've found bitcoiners to be the worst mix. Know-it-all 'independent' 'techspert' libertarians that have an understanding of economics that contains only what's on available on mises.org. Bitcoin isn't an economy, it's political grandstanding.

@_date: 2013-04-18 19:26:04


Uhm, that's their point. It's obvious and overt. To pretend it's anything but that **is** the disservice. It's disingenuous to suggest that the losers don't get a fair shake - that was never the plan. They are wars for the control of resources. 
The war itself doesn't *help* the economy, it's just that we've lead ourselves into a corner where we can continue to prop the economy up by warring, or we can collapse. However, the economy will never actually get better because of the wars. The wars subtract any of the money left for 99% of Americans, an objective disservice to the economy. It just keeps the funnel spinning on top

I asked you for your email so I can give you my resume. It's up to you whether or not you do. It's an account I made to troll the mod that banned my other account from posting to It *is* about 9 days old, and that's quite the observation. I don't think you are dumb enough to actually believe that fact to be significant, just dumb enough to find it a convenient excuse. 


I'm actually not sure of your ability to read at this point. Certainly not sentences, though your last post seems to suggest you can read names. I'd love for you to go into more detail on what you think we agree or disagree on, but given the fact that you think I thought that the transport layer protocol was a stickler issue, I don't think you really understand what I think, or write. 


You clearly don't know what you are talking about if you think the SANS intrusion analyst test is easier than an A+. It's a pretty specific cert. I never said it made me a genius, however it **most definitely** qualifies me as a *network security analyst*. If you can't put my name, the local subreddit I post to (even on this 9 day old account - LOL), GCIA, and two of my previous employers into a google search to find more about me - then you most definitely lack the skills of a network security analyst. Certainly you are a extra stupid if you think it can't be verified with LinkedIn. I was able to find my profile with half of that information.


Ok, share your resume. Share a link. Share your SANS cert (expired certs are still listed).

I'd check your link. That's not a replication strategy, that's the general page on replication in ms sql. 
Who cares who the transactions were? It has nothing to do with what we are discussing. If mtgox is being DDOS'd, what's the replicated server going to do anyway? You think they won't DDOS that as well? 
By the way, what do you think is the difference between distribution and replication in this context? Because if you are trying to survive a DDOS, you can't do it from just one site. And that's why what you are talking about isn't feasible. You can either eat it or force them to divide it between a large number of targets. I doubt mtgox will ever be able to eat what the world can throw at it. And the kind of distribution you would need in order to make a ddos unfeasible would *severely* prohibit the ability for the nodes to converge timely. You haven't suggested what sort of structure would allow for this.
I really think it's *you* that should be quiet.

Yes, like I've said, if you could quickly and easily convert the U$D back and forth from bitcoins, you wouldn't have to keep them and could *effectively* peg your price to the dollar. The problem now is you can only peg your price to the dollar as quick as you can pull the bitcoins out. 
It's not a plus for merchants compared to **any other way to accept payments in the world**. 
Until those services exist widely and are easily available, it's not easy enough. It's not practical. 
It is practical for one thing, though, buying drugs

Is upgrading an okcupid account something that people do so often that it's actually *convenient*? **No**


I did. You clearly don't understand what I'm talking about. 


This works for what kind of goods?
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:44:40
But people can't use it for everyday things because one day its $240 and the next it's $120
there aren't any services that make exchanging bitcoins as easy as paying on a credit or debit card or cash, so there isn't any convenience to using it as a short means of exchange
so really the only purpose is funneling drug money (aka U$D), speculation (selling it for U$D) or social grandstanding for your personal beliefs on the U$D. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:14:22


They have to be updated live (you fucking moron) in order to replicate, otherwise you can't have effective fail over. It doesn't matter the site, I'm not even challenging the feasibility of that. And who challenged what protocol they would use to connect the nodes? Shit it doesn't have to be a VPN, why not dictate a physical point to point link disregarding any sense of reality? It *still* wouldn't work. **You clearly don't know what the fuck you are talking about**. The ridiculously tangential technical terms you bring up to garner some sentiment of expertise give you away. It's not a honeypot if your production servers exist on the same network. 
What point would hiding exchanges behind a VPN (or 'honeypot'-lol) serve when everyone in the world has to access them over the same public interface that's being DDoS'd. How are you going to keep replication up if primary nodes are being overtaxed anyway? 


I'm clearly well versed enough to have this conversations, **you** volunteered yourself to provide the details. You said you had a link to a replication strategy - but you clearly wouldn't know one if it hit you in the face. 


Just admit you don't know what you are talking about and you won't have to answer any more questions you can't. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:58:36
Right - but you can't just design whatever. Bitcoin has some requirements that prevent the kind of dumb-node model that distributed networks employ. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:36:56
That's a really interesting take on replication strategies.
You sure do know what you are talking about.
You must do this for a living!


Serious bullshit like -
"And you know this how? A mirror is just another replicated server. All servers work on the same principle, SOP (standard operating procedure). Yes it is possible, and yes they should have taken these precautions. They would be VPN mirrors that are essentially off to the public until something like a crash occurs, instantly switching over the to the replicated environment."
As for your IQ points, I doubt you've actually lost any. They don't really get that low. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:36:16
It's actually pretty easy - but let's not think too hard, right? Let's not change the subject either.
You are a sad sad person that you have to go online and lie so much.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:59:36
Let's get this clear **right now**.
You just suggested that in order for mtgox to deal with a DDoS in a timely matter, they should physically replicate the data? Ok - let's pretend that's a disaster recovery scenario - how to handle the DDoS that's **still** preventing any users from being able to access the new server??


Why would I stop talking to you when you present yourself as an ever-greater moron with each additional post?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:51:55


No it wouldn't and you clearly have no idea what the fuck you are talking to. It would not take very long to change the target of a DDoS, and why would it? DDoS are generally performed by botnets, which are easy to control instantaneously.
Where did you get the idea that 'redundancy is the best strategy to allow for a steadier DDoS'? What *the fuck* does that even mean anyway?
What would securing the server have to do with a DDoS? You realize denial of service attacks generally fall within the framework of over-utilization of resources that *must* be made available?


You don't know what the fuck you are talking about. Google can survive because they have more bandwidth than anyone that can DDoS them. Google can send the bandwidth down their dark fibre. mtgox has to pay prolexic to swallow the DDoS traffic and prolexic still can't eat it all. Yes, the fact that google is widely distributed *helps*, but they aren't in the category of 10 sites. They are in the thousands. 
It's not something that mtgox can achieve, and even if mtgox did (as I mentioned last time), as the network of distributed replicants increases, their timely convergence becomes more prohibitive, so you are still faced with the same exact burden that made it impossible when I first responded and you first pretended like you knew what you were talking about.
Why won't you admit you are full of shit? It's incredibly obvious
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:51:37
Then you must recognize how absolutely full of shit you are
I mean really, which one is mission critical? Which one is an ad-revenue generator, and which one is the heart of a $100million+ economy?
Did you think that I suggested the problem for mtgox is that they would have to have more than 1 server doing the same thing? Because I certainly didn't.
Mt Gox's problem is that exchanges have to be centralized for the kind of performance they would like to achieve, a widely distributed network would not be able to process the exchange, in sync, in a timely manner. That's fucking obvious, VPN or not. Any swapping to a mirror in mtgox can be devastating as trades could be lost, as opposed to just a torrent for the pirate bay. If pirate bay mirrors are out of sync - ad revenue is still generated, if mt gox mirrors are out of sync, the service isn't working. 
Your cred: starting to doubt it
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:05:20


Yeah? What's your strategy then? What replication strategy do you think I had in mind? All I see you offering is nothing, I've provided a number of reasons why it's impractical. Bitcoin isn't plunging because of mtgox, bitcoin plunged because the market took a nosedive (because big positions were sold). I'm not even talk about the plunge anyway, you don't really seem to get it, no surprise considering the type of crap you are making up.


Really? I seem to not be completely full of shit pulling 'distributed networks that do whatever I say' out of my ass while claiming to do it professionally (a better sign of lies, I've never seen). If it was possible to reasonably decentralize bitcoin exchanges... THEY WOULD ALREADY BE DECENTRALIZED. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:52:03
that's more ridiculous thank Kurzweil's singularity
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:42:42


**No. You haven't**. Where is that replications strategy?? Where is distribution model that allows for timely convergence with distributed nodes?? **You haven't answered shit**. These are the problems to implement what you suggest, not the protocol that you use to encapsulate data between them (a.k.a why the fuck do you keep bringing up VPNs??).


Hey putzface. You need to work on your reading comprehension if you think I denied the existence of honeypots. Only that they aren't used this way. A VPN network isn't almost like a honeypot, it's a fucking VPN. A honeypot isn't a technical feature, it's a fucking concept. There are RFCs for VPNs, there is no RFC for honeypots. By the way, VPNs are by *definition* virtual. But hey - keep pretending like you know what a fucking network security analyst does, keep talking about VPNs as if I didn't suggest that you could grant whatever physical links you wanted. When we are done - I can send you my resume if you like. 
**You did not address the DDoS issue.** DDoS' starve the resources of the public interfaces of systems, If the public interface of the exchange cannot operate, it does not matter how many replicated servers exist on a backend, because they will not be able to get data from users. 


Yes. And seeing as you are some sort of quasi-literate moron, I identified this bandwidth as being *A LOT*. More than mtgox can deal with. More than prolexic (the best company for this) can deal with. What's with the naivety? This is self-evident.


You don't need a lot of money to DDoS. You need a botnet. You can rent a botnet. Renting a botnet isn't too expensive. Renting a botnet is incredibly inexpensive compared to the profits you will make by renting the botnet and attacking mtgox. 


Why would I do that? You clearly can't get into **any** technical details. You keep bringing up VPNs and honeypots which are about as least relevant as it gets to the problem at hand. I've asked you repeatedly how you are going to design a distributed system of exchanges that are resilient to DDoS attacks but timely as well. **You haven't**. What you are clearly too ignorant to realize is that this is a problem that *has* no solution. It's an inherent design constraint of distributed systems, yet you'd like to pretend it doesn't fucking exist for you design. *Literally* **incredible**.


You want to compare network security credentials now? ok. graduated RIT's GCCIS in 2009 with a degree in Networking and Sysadmin with a focus in security, worked for secureworks for 2 years as a security analyst, then the federal reserve bank of ny as the same.
