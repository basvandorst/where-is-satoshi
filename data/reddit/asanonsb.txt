The value of Bitcoin lies in its cryptography and decentralized infrastructure, being able to use the network's decentralized global ledger to store money without asking permission from any entity.  It's the most well-developed of all cryptocurrencies currently available in terms of network and therefore I personally see it as the least risky investment in crypto.
Gold's value is not directly linked to its industrial or artistic use, it is based on scarcity and the collective consensus of its worth as a store of value, just like Bitcoin.

It's only taxable on realized gains, aka when you pull it out of bitcoin and back into fiat.
My plan is to HODL until I don't even need to turn it back into fiat anymore.

Right after the Titanic sunk, killing the last few influential anti-Federal Reserve voices in the US... really makes one think.

What? You mean the Democrat Party doesn't even have a democratic system for choosing their candidates???
NOOO!! You're just spreading a vast right-wing conspiracy

I was agreeing with your post and its blatantly insulting nature toward those pushing the trans agenda and political correctness.  Was my post confusing?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:23:32
This is the only proper response to those trying to enforce political correctness.

401k's are doing pretty damn well this year too, nowhere near the earnings on Bitcoin but still thousands of dollars for anyone who's been throwing money into theirs for a significant amount of time.

If anything about the world elite's influence on central banking systems and specifically the Federal Reserve is unveiled to the normies and they finally realize how much of a scam fiat currency is, we're hopefully going to see a massive turn to bitcoin.  Hold onto your butts and hodl your coins, because if that goes down this shit is going to the moon.

Just did this with my Trezor, bought it at the 6k spike and then bought more coin at the dip.  Already up since the last buy.

If 8-tracks had the ability to alter their form continually and upgrade themselves to a next generation of technology, like you can with bitcoin's code, CDs would have never even been a thing.
Poor analogy.

"I used to like Assange back when he was an approved person to like and was giving us information about our political opponents.  However, since releasing emails that make the DNC look corrupt, the organizations and media talking heads which support the DNC have been releasing emotionally-driven reports about the man that make me FEEL differently about him now than before.  I'll make up some character flaws to bridge the logic gap in my mind."

I think you're getting your fake news confused.
Trump Jr met with Veselnitskaya in Trump tower to talk about adoptions, he thought she had damaging info on Clinton but it was just a waste of time.
Veselnitskaya has no connections to Wikileaks.

Wikileaks has released TONS of information detailing Russian government corruption over the years, he even released data revealing corruption in GWB's presidency as well.  Only when he's releasing information that makes the DNC look bad do people think he's all of a sudden a Russian stooge.

But but, I want free stuff!  Who cares that the amount of rights and property we have to give up to get said free stuff will destroy the country, I WANT FREE STUFF

He's an absolute retarded moron who committed a carefully plotted and perfectly executed open treason against the country right under the nose of the intelligence community.  The fact that Mueller found no evidence of him working with the Russians proves how brilliant this total retard is.  He's also a traitor.
GOD you're so stupid.
