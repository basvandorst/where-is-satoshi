Awesome feedback - thank you! 
What cold storage would you recommend? I know that cold storage is a must with this kind of decision. I use Copay and Bread now but would feel better with something like Trezor for the major of my holdings. What do you think?
Also, do you know which platform (ex. Bit wage) would offer the ability to diversify among different cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:30:32
That's the platform that seems to be most trusted from what I've learned from others here and yes, once I make my decision I'm committed to it. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:45:25
Why the switch from bitwage to manual? Is there any benefit to using bitwage instead of just beginning diligent in manually doing it?
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:05:21
What made you choose the Ledger nano S over comparable cold storages options and also, what about it appeals to you since purchasing?

Anyone whose been invested in bitcoin for any extent of time saw this coming. Volatility and bitcoin go hand in hand. Next week we'll see new ATH.

No, each exchange will differ based on several factors. Demand being the major factor.

How does this relate? I can't comprehend over your REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

That was my take. I haven't heard anything else that would cause a retreat to parity.
If anything it looks like expectation is higher than ever that ETF will be approved.

Just tried it on another device and still nothing.

Yes, he means they CAN buy and sell. 
If these exchanges do not allow users to transferred BTC from their exchange wallet to an off-exchange wallet than customers would just sell their BTC for CNY and most likely buy BTC through another medium. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:42:06
I was under the impression that this provision did not apply to users outside China and that foreigners were free to move bitcoin off the exchange. I'm I misinformed?

I have the Nano S and it's an awesome product. I store 90% of my bitcoin on it and keep it in a safe place. I rarely even touch it but when I do it's almost always to transfer bitcoin from my bread wallet. It's extremely easy to use when I do handle it. The most important thing is remembering the private keys (24 words). Never hurts to make a written copy and have a back up in a separate location or to create some tool and memorize the phrase.

Honestly, not a huge deal. I sent bitcoin to my roommate to get him set up but within days lost his phone. I've put it off and am getting back to it now. We have the recovery phrase and it worked but no bitcoin appeared when I imported the wallet.

The retirement account is key. That fact that you can own/trade within an IRA is another reason I like it. However, I currently don't own it in an IRA account (mostly because I don't have one set up yet).
I'll be keeping a close eye on how it trades up to and throughout the halving. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:00:01
I agree, can't be too top heavy with any one asset.  Now as far as replacing cash, I'm assuming it was just sitting in an account not earning much interest? 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:44:58
Agreed, I think I'll skim some profits and use it to purchase more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:53:46
That was my first inclination but with the current environment surrounding bitcoin and what's expected in the near future, I am leaning towards believing a rate increase having no affect.

Haven't done anything yet. Just opened it up for the first time since the fork. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:55:11
I honestly have not done much homework on other cryptocurrencies but I have seen this idea discussed before. I'll have to study up on a bit on the other cryptocurrencies before diving into it but I appreciate the suggestion. Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:32:26
Congrats on this milestone and most importantly for sticking to your gut instinct.

If I've learned anything from Trump it's do not believe what the media says about him.
@_date: 2016-11-10 22:25:54
I've supported him since the day he declared to run for presidency. Do I agree with everything he says or believes? No, absolutely not. I do believe his best interest is in the American people; all American people.

It's not the validity of your post that bothers me. It's your arrogant assumption that everyone on this sub is as informed about Bitcoin as you are. Bitcoin is unbelievably complex to the common man. New people are subscribing to this sub every day to learn more about this revolutionary technology. For you to make a "valid point" in the manner you did....gets us nowhere. 
Could of easily just quoted Satoshi and moved the hell on with your life.

Welcome to the club. Read as much as you can, accumulate over time and enjoy the addiction of being a hodler!!.

@_date: 2017-09-09 08:06:10
I've been a hodler for a little over a year and a half now. I remember those first months like it was yesterday. Every time BTC's price dropped in value I'd immediately assume the worst and would automatically question myself and my investment in BTC I'd let impulse control my behavior. Rather than doing my own due diligence I'd often talk myself into an internal struggle. Do I sell and take my meager profits or do I dive deeper and expand my knowledge on something I know little about?
Over the past year and a half I've made impulse decisions that I now regret. Today I ride the wave. With time comes experience. My advice to people who are just getting into BTC and crypto now...read and learn as much as you can. Investing in BTC in one thing. Understanding and realizing the impact of blockchain technology is another level. 
With time come conviction. Push yourself to know what it is that your investing in.

Depth of market is a measure of the number of open buy and sell orders for a security or currency at different prices. In this case there are a ton more open buy orders than there are open sell orders.
