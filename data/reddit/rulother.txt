I've been loving Gyft for a while now and can't wait to see what additional cards they put in.

As someone that can relate, this comment is golden.

Which group?

I would highly recommend taking that and buying up ASICMINER shares through btctc or similar sources. Their stock is set sky rocket in the near future.

Hey I love BSG, I'll watch it with ya for a btc :P
@_date: 2013-06-10 12:53:24
All I could think of when looking at this, is I want those beers lol. Never heard of Milton, but now I want it.

Been using them for a bit, just wish buying btc was faster with them.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:20:05
Thanks I was considering either BTC-TC or that.

Sad truth lol

Love you coinbase, but hate you at the same time... There goes my paycheck.

That's a good idea actually

At the current btc price, it's kinda tempting, but I'll save myself the hassle and just forget about it and save my money.

The quality of the website, is somewhat off putting. Thankfully you can just reserve your spot for the mean time. Hopefully, by the time they start allowing preorders, I'll have my singles from BFL, using the money from that.

Does this site use Prestashop for a backend?
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:35:58
I try to not have too many sites linked to my bank account as it is, and I love Coinbase.

Well, everytime it takes me about 3-4 days for delivery of btc, and the chances that they even have or are able to purchase btc is up in the air. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:00:37
I dig it 
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:13:51
I should just close btct for the day, seeing it dive (as little as may be), is a little depressing. In all they make up a vast majority of my investments.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:26:09
This is actually an amazing idea, now for those btc... Come on BFL!
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:49:44
Oh my god, all my $$$ money will be gone, so fast if this happens.
