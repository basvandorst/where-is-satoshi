I mean the very term: "BFL" it should be automatically replaced with "deceitful douchebags aka butterfly 'labs'", or something like that
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:48:25
none of us know that
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:35:44
there aren't that many stupid people wasting hashes
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:34:39

@_date: 2014-03-31 01:55:12

Luke Jr is a fundamentalist Catholic, and believes that *even* other non-Catholic Christians are "heretics". eligius.st is St Eligius. A rational minded person can only imagine his motivation.

BFL should be blacklisted from this sub. BFL feeds on new users, and destroys newbs understanding of bitcoin. BFL might be shills for the big banks....

that's technically true. But known pools are making boatloads of money. They have no reason to attack the network. If an attack happens, it will be from an unexpected direction
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:42:31
No. I'm not warming up a cold rolled wallet to prove a point. FU

bitcoin is falling for one reason, mtgox. There's uncertainty about whether the btc there were lost, and many of the larger, influential traders are waiting to know if they have lost their shirts!!    
The market will shift direction dramatically once we finally have closure about gox, one way or another
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:35:56
fuck thermoses, amiright guyz&gt;?
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:17:29

it's innovative disruptive technology. cryptocurrency is inevitable. It doesn't matter who is vocal about it
