@_date: 2017-12-15 10:30:39
You're right. And the fees are a joke.
But if everyone was using Segwit, there'd be more transactions available per block, so less competition driving the transaction fee up?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:47:26
They've got too much money at stake with Lightning.
We should go to 2MB blocks, the backlog would disappear in a day and transaction fees would be low. There'd be no impact on any node.

Too Long; Did Not Read
Currently, transactions do not contain the bitcoin value of inputs. Instead, they enclose the reference to the previous transaction, forcing TREZOR to use a workaround in order to safely retrieve the values and verify them. This process, however, takes precious amount of time. With SegWit, this will no longer be necessary as SW transactions include the value of inputs.
This is from that link the other guy sent.

Get a loan. You can get a $20000 unsecured loan from a P2P company pretty easily. Invest $10000 in bitcoin, keep the $10000 to pay off the interest for six months. This gets you credit to rewrite your loan to $50000.
Buy more bitcoin.
Bitcoin will earn more than the interest. But as it's P2P you don't need to pay it back as the company itself doesn't have much stake in loan.
You'll take a hit on your credit record. But will have over $50000 in bitcoin. In two years time you will be a millionaire.

There's no S2X now. Which means no free coins.
It also means those who wanted faster and cheaper transactions can't use S2X. So they're selling their bitcoins and buying bitcoin cash, which drops the price of the former and increases the price of the latter.
Rather than slightly increase block size, Core is has dreams of one day implementing solutions which don't use the blockchain. This means that transactions will be expensive for at least two years, unless the number of people using Bitcoin drops.

Exactly, they get a very similar upbringing, but they're different. Genetically, and likely small differences in the womb.
If one of them had been born a male, that would be more difference.
These small differences each affect the risk of certain behaviours, from social development, extro/introversion, concentration, pattern recognition, drive for novelty, risk taking/seeking, empathy, drive etc. These features can ultimately affect whether someone is interested in science/technology.
Now girls can still be C programming nerds, physicists, rocket scientists, mathematicians. And boys can be nurses and secretaries.
But statistically it's less likely, because of differences in sex.

Like cold fusion "is always 30 years away" because that's what the media have said for decades, he makes the analogy to Lightning.
Difference is that cold fusion has very difficult physics and engineering that has never been done at scale. Lightning takes a lot of organisation, planning and development talent, but it's not impossible. And will hopefully happen soon!

Buying alts is like timing the market. Some people will do well out of it, but most of us regular Joe's will just pay fees and struggle to break even.
It's quite unlikely that another coin completely usurps Bitcoin. I bought some alts, but not enough for any miracle money, saw them drop during bitcoins pre fork rally, then pick up. Wish I just held BTC.
They're more volatile. And it's more to worry about with multiple wallets etc.

See. The mods leave this type of shit in. (Which I support, I hate censorship).
But will delete any discussion about the pros of increasing block size, or any sort of discussion about the financial behind the scenes of Lightning.
I don't have a cent in BCash. I started with bitcoin after the fork. I want bitcoin to work well. I don't think censoring discussion and calling anyone with any scepticism a "shill" is helpful.
Clearly there's a limit on the number of transactions in a block. And maybe some are spam, but we shouldn't accept $10 fees as a possibility. I know it's supply and demand, but having small blocks is artificially limiting supply.

Before we could get S2X if we bought bitcoin.
Now that fork isn't happening, we're stuck with expensive and slow to move bitcoin.
Those who want faster transactions are moving to a coin that supports that.
I'm sticking with Bitcoin, but that's because the brand is important. Hopefully one day Core will do something to help transfer rates. But some of the developers probably have incentives to avoid simple solutions (such as a block size increase) as they want to make money from their multi layered approach.

Basically, you get people excited in a cheap investment by buying a lot of it. This drives up prices.
The price rise creates more publicity and demand, further increasing the value of your investment.

Then all it takes is a malicious exit node set to await bitcoin transactions, and they man in the middle your coin away!
There's plenty of censorship of the internet, and although it's very hard to make something impossible to access, it's very easy to make it difficult to access.

Friend in her twenties went to China. They block Facebook there. What did she do? Get a VPN? Use Tor?
No. She went without Facebook. That's what most normal non technical people do.


Yep. But most people won't bother. Probably fewer than 21 million people would bother.






I don't have to trust the salesperson at the shopping centre. I have consumer protection laws.
I don't have to trust the company in China posting me cheap electronics. I can reverse the credit card charge.
I don't have to trust the local corner store. If he rips me off he'll lose his reputation.
You don't have that protection with bitcoin. You can pay someone, you can't prove it's them you paid, you can't cancel a deal, and you can't post an online review of "14UJTwkHT76Ys9Vrxiie7AE6XMQ1swYot1" and expect anyone to care.
(I think a future cryptocurrency should have some sort of confirmation flag, so things aren't final until both receiving and sending party have agreed so, with the ability to reverse the transaction.)

If money is scarce, losing a wallet with a few hundred on it would be horrific.
Having said that, I live in a country where I can trust the banks, where I could hide cash in my house, where I could cash in investments relatively easily, and that if I lost it all the government would pay me a $500 salary every week. So relatively bitcoin is higher risk.
But if my nation's currency was shot, banks blatantly useless, and I was wanting to survive and flee the country, I'd go with bitcoin over anything else.

I'm not judging anything on sexuality. This is about risky behaviours.
Straight guys sometimes have sex with men. Gay guys can be virgins.
That's why the question states "have you had sex with other men".
The prevalence in those men is over 100x higher than in the general population.
The fact that you are uninformed doesn't make you an idiot. But the fact you can't step back and think scientifically, and instead bolt out thinking you know the answer based on feelings pretty much confirms it.
No blood test is 100% sensitive. That's not opinion, it's a fact.

As a test isn't 100% sensitive, you want to reduce the risk of false negatives.
A few screening questions about behaviour can delineate that risk.

Do you know the difference between sexuality and activity?

The test never asked about sexuality. And it seems in the USA, they are still asking if you've had MSM contact in the last 12 months.
If you're in a active gay relationship, you still can't donate.
Which isn't saying anything about their sexuality. But about risky behaviours.

@_date: 2017-10-07 20:15:24
Yeah.. I've seen some of the American ones on YouTube, which make you scan your licence or other ID.
I wouldn't do that even if they had no fees. I don't even need anonymity, but realise that some people might.
I hope eventually bitcoins ATMs are widespread enough with low enough fees that they can be used for travel.
At the moment if I'm overseas and run out of cash I'll go to a Cirrus ATM outside a bank. I then pay my bank at home $6 for the privilege, sometimes the ATM itself $5 for a fee, then also get hit with a purposely bad exchange rate and another 2.5% fee.
So for a withdrawal of $200 overseas, I'll be paying (very) roughly $20.
At the moment, bitcoin ATMs still can't beat this, but once fees are effectively less than 5% and confirmation for withdrawal is near instant, I think they'll be the currency of choice for younger travellers.

I think we need a devil's advocate...


It's uneconomical to send anything less than $20. If bitcoin's value increases, it'll only get worse.


See above. But mostly all those complaints about fees. Then we're told "you should look at it as a store of value, not a currency you can use."


I'm not sure how difficult it would be to just block requests on 8333, or from known core servers. Sure you could use a VPN, but they try to break them too.


Except who you purchase it off. You can't trust exchanges. Everyone wants your id.


I've sent my driver's licence and passport and selfie to multiple companies and randoms on localbitcoin.


"The government has my Trezor, and my house with the code has been looted.'




See complaints two weeks ago when fees were high and processing times were long.




You need internet access that doesn't actively block it.


They can certainly try to make it difficult.


Fee to buy. Fee to trade. Fee to transfer. Fee to sell .




So not private.. It's pretty traceable.

Sampling bias to some extent is inevitable in any survey.
In this case you're asking "are you familiar with bitcoin?" to a subreddit dedicated to bitcoin and bitcoin related memes.
So you're going to have a high percentage being very familiar.
When you write your results, it's important that you don't generalise it to the rest of the population.
So you can't say "90% of people had heard of bitcoin" and apply it to everyone. It only really tells you what the people you sample think.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:07:24
One other hard thing, is you'll get people acting as if they know the future and talking with complete confidence.
These aren't trolls or manipulators, just people who seem to believe they know what will happen. We probably all get that way.
The number of people saying the last dip (after the August ATH) was the end of things, that the brief recovery was a dead cat bounce. I still bought some, but not as much as if I wasn't clouded by their words.
Of course, they could have easily been right, it's such an easy thing with hindsight.
I'm starting to understand the hodl meme and why dollar cost averaging will work (provided there's a long term increase). I plan to do that, after the fork.

Just to explain replay protection...
When you make a transaction to an address, you use your private key to approve this (which other people can check with your public key).
So if I sent money on S2X to another S2X account, someone could duplicate that. Which would send your BTC coin to a likely non existent address.

Imagine a test is 99.9% sensitive.
That means it misses one out of every thousand.
If a population with a very low risk, say 0.01% donate blood, the chance of getting HIV through transfusion is acceptably low.
But sadly, the rate of HIV is not low amongst gay men. It's 24% in San Fransisco, over 10% in most cities.
You can see that there's a much increased risk.
Learn some statistics, and learn to think for yourself.

I'd buy these. It's only a few bitcoin.. And minimal fees.
If I didn't have cash, I'd have to use an ATM. And many US ATMs have fees.
For myself, being from overseas, I'd have to pay a massive fee to withdraw money. About $30 all up, so I'd really be wanting to get out $500 at a time. And fuck doing that at 3am by a Mexican takeaway.
If I was there I'd spend the bitcoin, pay $4.40 for two tacos instead of $4, but save all the hassle of expensive cash.
And sure, maybe the bitcoin price would change, but back home I'm sticking in a regular amount anyway so if it skyrockets to double, I'll be up either way.
And by using Bitcoin, it encourages more use, which makes bitcoin more valuable.
