If you've been round since the beginning (I have) you would see that most of the prominent figures in btc are/have been involved in shady business practices. 
Almost all of them spout that same rhetoric about fighting the power but ended up filthy rich and wanting more. Most of them would sell their own mother down the river for a few satoshis. 
In a bitcoin maximalist scenario you still end up with a wealthy ruling elite, just a different lot of greedy douchebags controlling all the money. 
IMO Bitcoin's value is on loan from a future crypto with a fairer distribution model.

It's the yubikeys that got me as well (for a LOT more). I trusted that fat french turd more than myself because of those fucking yubikeys.

Literally the worst person in the world to seek advice about this from.

He makes me want to throw up.

Every time his relevance starts to fade he comes up with a new way to put himself in the spotlight.
He has spouted the same rhetoric for years but still has failed to answer even the most basic questions about what actually happened. You could check this for yourself but he deleted all of his posts some time ago. 
Note that he won't answer any of the creditors poignant questions relating to what actually happened but he will answer questions about his underwear.
At this point in time it's safe to say that yes he does just love the attention and this AMA serves nothing other than his own colossal ego and delusions of grandeur. 


You're putting words in my mouth. 
If you believe the story he has told, Mark didn't even have a basic system in place to reconcile account balances with btc wallets. 
But of course this can't be confirmed because the "records" have been somehow destroyed or manipulated. 
I'm not saying that he shouldn't have had any free time at all. 
What I'm just saying that maybe he could have spent **a few moments** using his wonderful coding skills or spent **a couple of measly dollars** of the at least **$200m** of our money that he spent on god knows what during the **several years** he spent running the exchange, to come up with a basic accounting system so that the thefts couldn't have gone on for so long or for such a large amount of money. 
He claims he couldn't find the time to do this very basic, obvious thing. He could however find time to go gallivanting around with hookers and buying expensive machines for his failed cafe. 


It's rather more likely that he knew exactly whose money he was using for a long time considering the emails indicating he was well aware he was in the red since the very beginning. Not to mention the suspicious trading activity of the markus and willy bots etc etc.

I don't think many people are following this since it's buried but my point was that it was very public news at the time, apologies for not checking the source. I don't post on here very often and I made no attempt to try and hide my edit. It would be clear to anybody with half a brain what I'd done. Cheerfully Re edited anyway. 


I literally said one line about it and you made a huge issue about it. I was pointing out the contradiction in his bogus claim about not being able to find time to do things that needed to be done. 
We are talking about a man whose modus operandi is to tell massive lies, then delete his posts, then come and revise history when people have forgotten exactly what was said or given up caring. 
I don't think you understand the true character of this man. He said he was quitting reddit at one stage for crying out loud. It was a matter of hours after he had finally left that we formed a (semi) unified legal movement.
A smear attempt? This man has had direct involvement in literally the greatest heist in history and has so far escaped without any semblance of real consequence and barely a whisper in the media.
As a person whose suffered at his hands to the tune of millions, I'd say his character deserves far more smear than what he's received. 
I would really like to know where all that money went because it certainly wasn't spent on anything tangible, least of all a decent security or accounting setup for mtgox.
He told us he had the coins in cold storage, with the private keys stored in such a way as to make it impossible for them to be stolen or confiscated.
With his discourse he likes to paint a picture of himself as a man of moral fiber doing his "best" to try and recover customer funds, but this basically couldn't be further from the truth. 
He has employed (seemingly) deliberate attempts at stalling active creditor response on numerous occasions and has displayed near constant veiled contempt towards us. 
If you look at the outcome with the "surplus" funds going into his hands, it's pretty obvious why he was stalling us until after the deadline for filing objections to the claims process had passed.
He has antagonized many different creditors on many, many occasions. He even made a statement to the effect that he felt somehow entitled to the "surplus" funds right before he "left" reddit. Of course I can't verify this statement because he deleted his entire post history.
I don't think you understand how truly sick he is, I don't know why you're trying to defend him. About his decision to spend customer funds on prostitutes no less.


At least if he spent the money on lambos or something tangible we could have recovered some of it, as it stands now it vanished into thin air.

The trustee has made a claim against tibanne of $200m what did you spend all of this money on?
Also why did you delete all of your previous reddit posts and run special scrubbing software over them so they can never be retrieved?
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:47:35
You found yourself "managing emergencies everyday without any time to do the work that'd need to be actually done." 
Yet you somehow found time to start up a bitcoin cafe complete with a $35,000 Backen pastry oven and $23,000 on a La Marzocco coffee machine.
Oh and you also found time to spend customer funds on prostitutes.
The trustee has made a claim against tibanne of $200m and you couldn't spend any of this money hiring a decent security team/decent coders to fix MtGox? What did you spend all this money on?
The way you lie and seek attention is truly sickening Mark. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:09:21
Translation: Because I was too busy having my dick sucked and buying $30000 coffee machines with customer funds to bother with basic accounting practices.

Mark is an evil narcissist who revels in the attention. He is truly a master of farce.
He delayed the forming of a real creditor group by acting as the de facto leader of the bankruptcy community through the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit and offering legal counsel that was woefully incomplete and has resulted in the outcome that legally he will receive most of what's left over.
He continues to antagonize us even after he deleted all his reddit posts and claimed he was quitting reddit. 
I lost many millions of dollars I could have used to better my own life and the lives of those I care about, he makes me feel sick and violated to the very core of my being.

Cheerfully edited.


To quote the first paragraph of the article:
"The head of collapsed Bitcoin exchange MtGox was facing fresh embezzlement charges Wednesday, as Japanese media said some of the allegedly stolen funds were spent on prostitutes."
The trustee of tibanne has recently made a new claim of ~$200m against the trustee of mtgox, AFAIK without much mention of what the money was spent on. Given there was very little actual property sold off at the beginning apart from a few small things, It's a fair bet there was a disgustingly large amount of customer money spent on hookers.
