Could be a combination of mistrusting the government while still having relative freedom with internet and such, as opposed to China for example.

This week is very likely to be the most voluminous (is that a word?) week ever on Binance. I don’t know enough to make bold claims, but with the ETF and general insteresr and such, I think this will be an exciting fall.

This week has been the third biggest ever in volume on Binance. The two bigger were during the dump in february this year.

I meant exciting price-wise

I’m not in it for the lambo. And that’s some classic negative Nancy low-key FUD you got there. I’m definetely not certain the exciting fall will be a positive thing, more like no-idea-what-is-going-to-happen.

What would be the house in bitcoin? Sort of the point with it is that there is no house. Whales I guess, but that isn’t really true either.

I can’t make my mind up about volumes, do we want high or low? It seems to grow slow but steady while volume is low, but it also feels like it could plummet any time if interest dies.
So, what volumes do we want?

Was her day-trading boyfriend (manfriend?) who told her it was going upwards, sorry bro.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:02:00
I do, but I don’t plan on spending or selling for a very long time, unless something extraordinary happens.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:14:39
She was positive because she heard from someone she trusts that it’s been going up. Never seen media around here mention crypto, unless you watch very niched economy news.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:16:37
Fortunately not, and I’m never selling so it doesn’t matter anyway.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:18:10
Well, maybe sometime, but yeah, I like looking at candles.

Eh, my family doesn’t do drama like we’re in a soap opera.

At the moment I’m thinking that I will only cash out when it could afford me a really nice apartment or house, and that’s pretty far away. There is a possibility I will never cash out for reasons you said. I hold a few alts that I think I will use for trading once they moon (ehe), the btc is for hodling.

Almost certain it’s upwards, this is based on nothing but feeling and useless, homemade TA. And also because we just made it through the weekend without dips, I think this week will bring green volumes.

I’m thinking a couple of days of sideways until next big move. But who knows

I got into crypto in late 2017/early 2018, gonna take more than this to make me sell.
