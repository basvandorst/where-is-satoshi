Yes, I have.  And if I were sitting there before it had reached a critical mass, and I knew how big and pervasive it would be, and I had a chance to replace it with something *much* more efficient, I would.

What is your definition of "success"?  "Failure"?  Is bitcoin not already successful, because it's being used for transactions around the world, at this moment?
You mentioned you got in last August and learned how the network works, and "why it will not fail."  So, what did you learn?
Also, asking us to support our conjectures about the future with "clear, full evidence" is an odd request.
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:36:56
Yes, already have.  It's an awesome and obvious innovation, and since I don't have the energy to contribute to its development, throwing some btc their way is the next best thing I can do.
Ethereum climbs to the top of the bitcoin perspective, takes stock of its goals and where it "leaves off", then in one fearless leap of insight abstracts out the scaffolding (blockchain-based consensus), building a full, Turing-complete programmability layer on top of it, with accounts, contracts, computational fuel, etc.  I think it will speak for itself soon enough, and people laboring on and on with bitcoin opcodes will come to see them as plastic lego blocks compared to the full-blown manufacturing yard being built behind the frosted front windows of Ethereum...
So yes, I own some ether. Or at least a wallet with the keys to it.

We *are* seeing the innovation and the business models.  This particular thread is about edging into the debate in a mature, professional way.  Not only is it not worth getting negatively worked up over a computer program, but there really *is* a lot of good that can be done with it.  Since I don't personally have the guts to put on a suit and get in front of crowds with such a message, I'm glad there are people like Mr. Allaire doing so.
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:34:37
He doesn't seem malicious at all.  He may have been extremely certain of the continued skyrocketing of btc/usd and spent some too soon, thinking it would only be a drop in the bucket.  Then this price lull happened and suddenly he couldn't afford to pay his customers.
My preferred theory, however, is that the *you-know-who* showed up to confiscate them, but somehow the password to the keys just escaped his memory.  You know, being under immense duress and all.  They're waiting for him to find it, he's waiting for them to fuck off so he can get the coins to their actual owners.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:23:59


Yes, very laid back.  First, it's good to see that you are  concerned about and questioning your own strong reaction to something. Can you yet answer *why* you are obsessed with bitcoin, and why it is coming head-to-head with your university studies?  Could it be that if your distant hopes turn out to be true, this new module you're starting in two weeks probably won't matter anyway?
Having a relatively comfortable career in IT, I follow bitcoin and am generally interested in it, and want it to succeed.  But if it doesn't, that's fine too.  I am at a level of investment and risk that I am comfortable with: if it succeeds, I'll be in it, if it fails and my initial investment goes to zero, I won't be sitting on the curb crying.  There is zero emotion involved in this picture, so I can live my life in the meantime.
Take your university courses seriously and consider them of primary importance.    Don't abandon the real world that is here and passing by you *today* based on a conjecture about tomorrow.  Keep your investment and risk levels in check.  One of the biggest proponents of bitcoin I'm aware of says he buys about $20 a week of bitcoin.  In my opinion this is the right way to do things, but in the end it's up to you.

Technically it is for the most valuable 7 transactions per second, at least in its current form.  Until this improves, since the blockchain is for everyone, I'll yield the room from my donut purchase.  But do what you like.

You're doing a great job with Ethereum. I've been following this for months now and am more excited about it than I have been about anything in a while.  I bought some ether last night, if for no other reason than to tip my hat to you for pushing the envelope (and beating the rest of us to this idea!)
This will be to law, contracts, DAOs, etc. what bitcoin is to currency, and even if the network never catches enough of the good type of hashing power, *somebody* needed to take this step, which, as you've alluded to in the past, is one of those "so simple it was obvious" things, that I'm surprised was not thought of sooner.
Keep up the good work and the innovative spirit... I know the pressure can't be easy, especially in these idiot- and troll-infested waters.

Please stop using the term flash crash, and please stop blaming these movements on arbitrary causes.  This is textbook price movement for a currency that is done consolidating.  Zoom out to the daily chart and observe the high, the low, then lower high, higher low, lower high, higher low, etc. forming a triangle.  When price reaches the apex and chooses a direction it always does it dramatically.  *Always*.   Price never consolidates and then gradually spins back up in a direction.
The only thing surprising on this chart is how long it took to break the apex.  In fact, from my point of view (I have been trading currencies since before bitcoin was born), bitcoin keeps alternating between feeling and looking like an actual currency traded by seriously invested speculators, and looking and feeling like a confused, drunk index of some sort of inefficiently organized mass of noobs.
For a more gentle introduction to technical analysis I recommend [this guy](

Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy.  Where it is heading will necessarily need to be done in developmental stages, with early priority on making the network as resilient to attack as possible.  But as time goes on, it will mature and become the foundation of the global economy.
For now, though, every transaction is expressed on the blockchain.  The blockchain is the "hardware" layer of bitcoin, the "punchcards", if you will.   The economy is still transacting and being built with these punchcards.  But eventually a "software" layer will evolve, lifted above the blockchain (maybe even call it the "RAM"), that is trusted to hold large amounts of individual smaller transactions "in memory", only using the blockchain to occasionally "settle" differences between accounts held by the larger "programs" in the market.
Gavin has gone into this sort of thing in more detail here:

Agreed.  The root problem is runaway usury and arbitrary fractional reserving, not the idea of a money storage place itself.  Bitcoin *can* become an existential threat to bankers in the sense portrayed above, but it can *also* be an offering to debride themselves of the evil within and replace it with what bitcoin brings to the table, and what it offers us all in return.  If you catch my drift.
