the (wif) key in the image? I have a copy I didnt mark over before uploading.

Okay so that works fine but it's sending to a wallet it generated before I created a login. Is that going to be an issue? I can't seem to find it to access it but have the address for some reason.

haha I figured, again when I made the account through the site it generated me a separate address not connected to this one. Maybe my error? But i'm just looking for a client that's decently trusted to load it into. I have the btc core client on my system for now

thanks for that, it shouldn't have taken me asking to figure it out. I just figured i'd see if there was an easier way without blockchain. Online wallets are just a risk to me for storage

got it under control with just using the command line. But thanks again haha. It was fairly instant as soon as the info was in

okay but again how to I access it? Can I put the address into a btc client? I've always used the pre-generated ones from clients in the past. I have both keys that go to it, blocked them out in the image for safety sake

New to multisig but not bitcoin. I feel like an idiot for even asking, believe me.

it's trying to go to some wallet it generated initially. can provide a screen shot if necessary. The transaction did process otherwise

Used the circled address without thinking to use my local wallet initially. What will happen to my coins? That's not the same one it gave me when I created my account at the end of the process.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:30:54
is there a wallet to make this process a bit more painless? Just looking for a recommendation instead of all the code in the wiki lol. I just want to import but the bitcoin core doesn't have an option

They have forwarded it to payment specialist. i'm doubting anything will come of it and I consider it a total loss at this point. It sucks but there's nothing I can do.

They forwarded it to a payment specialist but I have written it off which is a very hard loss.

he's not kidding, after mt.gox and coin.mx disappeared with a lot of coins/money it's become foolish to keep them online
