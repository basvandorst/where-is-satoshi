How is your link proof the US had very little to do with it?
11 ships deployed. Airstrikes. Leadership roles. Admonition of foreign governments for not joining in the "intervention". Etc.

The US was 2nd in cost expenditures in the operation at around $1 billion dollars.
Just because it was an operation organized under the umbrella of NATO, in which some other NATO states such as Germany did not participate in btw, does not diminish the US role at all.

Weak argument to support the statement "The US had very little to do with it."
 They were the 2nd top contributor to the operation. Public sentiment at the time was already swayed against more US involvement and expenditure in foreign operations. Especially in this case there was a need to avoid being seen as the primary, and to elevate other actors as the primary roles.

True, he was turning things around it seemed, looking to have a more positive aspect on African politics, though I don't know enough one side or the other on how to judge him in his later days.
I can understand your aversion to what he got in the end. But, I can't say I am against giving brutal dictators a horrid end either. Maybe if every dictator knows going in that they'll suffer in the end, maybe they'll be less likely to be such assholes.

Yeah, but the commenter said "I miss that gentleman."
I mean, sure, you can admire what he said, just don't go admiring the man.

It wasn't even hard, mostly just used his own source against him even.

In most instances though, the wrong people are pissed off for the horrible things they do. So, does it matter at that point?

Well, that's a lot of bitcoins to claim to have had control of...
