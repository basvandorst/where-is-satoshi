It doesn't matter if there wasn't fiat involved in the trade. If you bought the .1 bitcoin for $100 and traded for $900 worth of LTC, then you would have to pay taxes on the $800 gain.

I used a bitcoin atm once and I think it said not to send funds from an exchange wallet because the exchange won't send it fast enough or something. And it had a list of recommended wallets to use instead.

If you think you can  make large bitcoin purchases without the IRS knowing, you have no concept of how the real world actually works. You can't even buy cars or homes in cash without the IRS knowing. Bank account, yes... but when I say cash I mean literal stacks of cash. The dealership will report the transaction. People can't transfer their homes to their children without a tax liability, so what makes you think a random stranger will put his ass on the line for you? Welcome to the real world. The IRS is smarter than you.

Appreciated. Thank you for sharing!

That's what I said lol

The way I see it, bitcoin is like cash (or maybe something in between cash and debit card)... you shouldn't be carrying around large amounts and if you are, don't blab to everyone about how much bitcoin/money is in your wallet (unless you want to get robbed)
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:50:15
What’s your point? There’s always a risk of getting robbed. Doesn’t stop people from traveling without their phone, wallet, mobile wallet whatever
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:18:37
I don't see how pulling cash out of a bitcoin ATM is any different then pulling cash out of a regular ATM? Or why paying for something with bitcoin instead of a debit/credit, is riskier? Either way, you're pulling out cash out of an ATM. Or trying to pay for the same item/service. There's no reason to assume someone is wealthy because they use bitcoin instead of a debit card.
If someone's going to attack or rob me, it's most likely because I'm a woman/tourist/alone... which is something I can't really help. Sure, I can be safe and never travel or be alone, but I'm not the type to let fear stop me from experiencing life. Point is, I have bigger things to worry about than being a known bitcoin user lol :)
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:36:06
Lol no it doesn’t. Imagine if $200 was going to be split amongst 11 people. One person gets $80, 5 people get $20 each, and the last 5 people get $4 each. Having 2% of the money which is $4, does not make you top 2% of ownership.

Can I ask what country you're referring to for the bitcoin ATMs? That is my experience from being in the U.S., but another user said that most bitcoin ATM's dont check ID's. Making arrangements to meet up with someone seems like way too much of a hassle when you're traveling. You could get lost and not have a way to communicate with the other person without wifi or phone reception. I can see that working if he/she was willing to come to me, but being in a new country where you might not speak the language can be overwhelming as it is. And without LocalBitcoins, I'm not sure how to even find people
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:59:44
Can I ask what country you're from? The bitcoin ATMs in my area charge 7-10% in fees (or the ones that I know of).  Exchanging your bitcoins on a regulated crypto exchange will certainly incur taxes, so some people might think the atm fees are worth it
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:17:53
It's supposed to lol. Would you mind sharing some countries you found to be more bitcoin friendly?

Most debit cards advertising as "crypto" debit cards aren't really crypto debit cards in my opinion. They're just regular debit cards/bank accounts that do the BTC/USD exchange for you. You're not actually using bitcoin... You're paying for another company to exchange your bitcoin into USD/fiat, so you end up paying the exchange rate on top of whatever the debit card company charges. And because you're traveling, they have to convert the USD to another currency, so there's more fees. Would be cheaper and easier to exchange on coinbase and just use your bank's debit card.
 I don't see the point in using these "crypto" debit cards and I wouldn't trust any start-up companies to hold my bitcoin. It doesn't help with mass adoption. There's no incentive for businesses to take bitcoin payments if their customers are willing to take on the fees and hassle of exchanging BTC to fiat for them.

I keep btc stash on a hardware wallet and would have a smaller amount on my mobile wallet for travel/expenses. There's no way of knowing how much bitcoin you have on you, so I don't see how that's a risk? I'm sure being from a 1st world country with the newest iphone might make you seem "rich" to some people, but that would make you a target regardless of whether you use bitcoin or not. The risk seems minimal to me

\*\*Millennials were either freshmen in college or starting their first job *before the recession.*
During/after the recession, millennials were either laid off or couldn't find work after graduating. Being unemployed meant they couldn't pay off student loan debt or get a head start on savings. Many had to move back in with their parents to save money and most won't be able to afford homes even after 10+ years of savings (I live in CA lol).

Can you elaborate on how this might happen? Or if anyone can explain how USD accounts are insured that would be helpful... Is it only US dollars being insured or your bitcoins as well? Would the hacker have to purchase bitcoin before transferring out of your account? If so, are the USD insured if it's used to purchase bitcoin and moved out of your account?
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:44:22
Why would someone carrying bitcoin be more likely to be kidnapped? It depends on the PERSON and how they carry themselves. I don't assume anyone in this sub is wealthy because they own bitcoin (most aren't).
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:40:37
So if the hacker converted the USD to bitcoin and transferred to another wallet, would the stolen USD/BTC be insured in this case?
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:04:49
Download the delta app. Put in the date you bought x amount of bitcoin at x price. The app calculates your profit for you.

I completely forgot about that. Thank you!

It's true. The government is slowly encroaching on our rights and most people don't know or won't even care til it's too late. If you care about your privacy and freedom, pay attention to sex workers. They are usually manning these battles at the front of the line.
1. SESTA/FOFSA (Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act) was passed last year and it was the beginning of internet censorship. The major advertising platforms now requiring ID checks if we want to post an ad.  Porn sites will soon be requiring id checks to very users are of age and it won't stop there. And don't be so naive to think your personal information is safe or won't be abused - it's already happened with big name tech companies.
2. EBHTA (End Banking for Human Traffickers Act) is currently in the works and it's an attempt to expand on the Patriot Act in the name of "trafficking." If this bill passes say hello to even stricter KYC/AML regulations.
*But trafficking is bad!!!! Good riddance. I have nothing to hide. Why should I care?*
Truth is, there is very little sex "trafficking" going on. It exists, but nowhere near the numbers that have been circulating. The majority of sex work occurs between two consensual adults. This bill was a thinly veiled attempted to target sex workers. Many of us have already had their bank accounts/credit cards shut down for having transactions related to sex work. I know, no one cares about sex workers, so look up Operation Choke Point if you want to read about how the Obama administration wrongfully cut off banking for legal businesses. Banking institutions should not be political. If you want to spend your money on drugs and escorts, so be it.
**TLDR:** The outcry to end trafficking is just a ploy used by government and religious groups to propagate their own political agendas, so it's no surprise that drug dealers and terrorists are being used as a scapegoats to fight unregulated cryptocurrency. Over-surveillance and control come hand in hand. The government wants to control how you spend your money and what you see online. Big Brother is coming for us and you've been warned.
Edit: Btw, no money laundering going on here. I pay my taxes. I got into bitcoin because I didn't want the sex work ads to show up my debit/credit card.

Bitcoin is uncensored and borderless in theory (as long as you stay within the system). But I imagine converting it to fiat/cash is where issues will come up. Does he have a US bank account? Does he have a social security number? Can you prove the income was obtained legally? Honestly, I don't have any experience with this, but these are some concerns that I would have if I were you. It might be more hassle than just doing a bank transfer
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:56:27
I already said you might already be a target because you might appear to be a “wealthy” tourist. Still has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Not really? A significant amount could be 20k or 500 k depending on the person
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:30:11
Is 90-160k supposed to be a down payment or a house? That's not even enough for a down payment if you live in CA or NY lol
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:41:55
Median home price in the US is 279,000, so at least 50% of the population wouldn't be able to buy a house for 90-160k.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't send bitcoin to a hardware wallet from cash app right? I've purchased a small amount, but don't feel comfortable holding a large amount with cash app
