good, letting the 10min delay aside: please address the underlying asset-point. you said it was institutions buying in. which is bogus. the futures are exactly the reason and vehicle why most of them are "allowed" to buy into btc.

you know that for every short, there's a long needed to be placed and executed?

proper question. but once the transaction time goes down, some will arbitrage the F out of it and fill that gap.

what you forget is, that the USD value does hardly matter (big scale-wise). it's about %-gain when we're talking about dips and the rise. btc can only double so much more, until hitting a hard cap. but starting from the few cents it used to be... well... you figure the rest. 17k to 70k is "only" ~410%. NEO for example went 800% in a matter of a few weeks back then without really dipping. while i dont say btc WILL rise, chances are that we see 100k sooner than we think. just because it's not THAT of a climb %-wise.

well, ofc it's a bubble. but what isn't? a bubble pops on hysteria and manifests itself only in hindsight. great. other than that: let the DOW (because not very bubbly) drop 8000 points and show me the difference in the outcome.

it's merely 600btc. we've killed two 1k walls within 24hrs apart from each other the past week.

actually, if you followed the exact start of the CBOE trading at Bittrex or GDAX, you would have seen that those 2k came back into the market from people waiting on the USDT-sidelines. CBOE does not affect Bittrex' trading for the actual asset. EDIT: also 10min time-delay of the first prices for the futures went by without anyone in the world knowing what the actual price is for the futures. still the price shot up on the exchanges.

you aren't late :-). on-the-books wall street money is just flowing in since last week.

trading in btc futures has nothing to do with holding the asset, since it's cash settled (contrary to the two options to settle oil futures for example - one being oil, one being the barrels themselves).
