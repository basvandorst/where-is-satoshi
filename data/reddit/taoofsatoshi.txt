Every currency does, let's face it.

Know, I did not. Disappointing, this is. Try again, I will! Thanks for the feedback, mate, at least now I know someone saw it.... ; )

You are the winner. Congrats!

Must be the Bitcoin Builder account.

Yeah, I think I remember someone posting a website a few months ago, I should have saved it...

Google "Darkcoin". Kristov Atlas' review is forthcoming, it is adding the finishing touches for a launch within the month. 99.9% anon, it will be the currency of choice for privacy seekers.

Alternative. I believe in competition.

Any study on high performance transactions begins and ends with Dash's InstantX.

Bitcoin has definitely got to find a way to avoid stalemates in the future, or suffer these long drawn out battles at every important turn.

Wow, you sure put a lot of work into that didn't you? Leave it to an XMR zealot. Unfortunately, that long winded diatribe hasn't a speck of proof in it. Not only that, the point is totally irrelevant moving forward. Investors want to see value for their purchase, and Dash is delivering constantly. Not to mention value for the end user. Those are the things that matter.

Dash. It's all about the InstantX!

Bitcoin seems to be having a hard time coming to a consensus. One particular altcoin that looks very interesting is Dash, or digital cash. Votes are held through the full nodes, and the decision is binding. 
Dash also has a lot of other things going for it such as privacy, fungibility, InstantX (instant transactions), and a soon to be revealed (Bitcoin Miami) solution for the scalability issue with Dash Evolution.
If any alt shows promise to succeed Bitcoin, it's Dash.

Dash has a large group of developers working around the world. The instamine happened, I've done my research on it and in my opinion, it's a net positive for Dash. The tech behind Dash can not be ignored, as it is far superior to Bitcoin. Instant transactions, privacy, and fungibility have all been solved by Dash, with the solution to scalability and more to be revealed in January at Bitcoin Miami. You are entitled to your opinion, of course.

You bring up a fair point that has been raised before. Hell, even I had reservations when I started researching Dash. However, a lot of the information out there is skewed negative, with some facts ignored. This post explains the instamine in an unbiased way: 
As an investor, I'm happy that the core dev has a good stash, so he will be incentivized to create an exceptional product. And exceptional it is, with more features to be revealed at Bitcoin Miami in January.

Hey, Evan. I did some digging, and this is the best I could come up with. The thread has a table and some links which may be useful...
