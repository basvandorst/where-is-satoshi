Isn’t a prepaid MasterCard locked into the MasterCard network? If you want to then use your MasterCard for a cash advance, and remove cash from the card, you’d pay a cash advance fee. 
This sounds somewhat similar.

The key point here is having someone to inspire and teach you, it doesn't have to be a professor. It could be a coworker or a friend, someone who mentors you. That provides just as much experience (if not more) than a professor. 
I think it's about finding those people, whether it's some form of official education or not. Society today just believes you've got to pay for that guidance now. Some of us didn't but still have great educations.

I'd be happy to help test one out. Looks promising!
Edit - Also just read more and see that it's open source, that'll be awesome. Can't wait to peruse the code and see if I can't come up with some ideas.

I don't think you could. You wouldn't have a way to identify which transaction belongs to which customer if everyone's sending to the same place. 
What you'd need is a system to generate a unique address for every individual order and show them to the appropriate customers. Then have the system watch all of the individual transactions until they're complete and you can finish their order.

I think I had it already and don't think I needed to install it, but those versions sound strange. When I run `brew list gmp`, it looks like I've got 6.0.0a installed:
    brew list gmp
    /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a/include/ (2 files)
    /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a/lib/libgmp.10.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a/lib/libgmpxx.4.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a/lib/ (4 other files)
    /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a/share/info/ (3 files)
What does yours look like?

Saw your post and decided to give it a shot as a brain tease for this saturday afternoon and to learn a bit more about Primecoin. Here's a link to the binary from my dropbox:
I fired it up and was able to connect to the beeeeer.org pool and start mining. Let me know if it works out!

That's what I've always seen given as advice - set a weekly/monthly buy based in your base currency, and start accumulating. It'll average it out the cost.

Humanity could also get lucky and wrangle an asteroid with a huge surplus of gold. The tech isn’t there yet, but someday it will, and at that point is gold going to still maintain its speculative value (beyond the utility of it in products)? 
This has always been one of my favorite Bitcoin vs Gold arguments. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 16:56:46
Absolutely it has to be profitable to mine (if it’s a business doing the work), and since gold actually has utility, it will always maintain some level of value.
The point is that gold isn’t a finite resource in the universe and it’s scarcity isn’t mathematically defined. Gold could feasibly become much less scarce in the future with advances in technology. It could be we learn to synthesize gold artificially, dig it out of the earth, find it on another planet, or mine it from an asteroid. It could be an advance in technology we can’t even begin to speculate about today. Chances are that in the future, gold won’t be scarce anymore, and any value created by its scarcity currently will be lost.

They really should add a command to query for what version the node is on, in the event that the owner hasn't added a message!

Am I right in assuming that looking at a 0.10.x blockchain explorer (btc.blockr.io?) will always show only valid blocks and never the forks? Figured it might be useful information if there's always someplace public you can look that's always valid. 
Edit - I'd love to know if this is incorrect, as I've seen reports that blockchain.info is still displaying v2 blocks.

How in the world did you come to that conclusion? I'm not trying to get into a pissing match with you, but I'm interested to know if your response is because your jaded somehow or you actually have some sort of legitimate reasoning behind your comment. 
A blockchain forum provides an verifiable edit history, can be built to be uncensorable while also being trustless, where accounts use a key pair to prove their identity as the originator of that content and those accounts establish a reputation for all to see. It's also stored on a globally decenralized content blockchain that no one controls or can just hack into to change data. 
It provides magnitudes more value than a forum based upon a database. If you don't see that, I'm sorry.
*Edit* - To address your original comment, I like your approach. We really do need an uncensored space to hash this out. The drama in bitcoin revolving around the blocksize debate needs to end and we need to do it someplace where no one's going to delete our posts.
