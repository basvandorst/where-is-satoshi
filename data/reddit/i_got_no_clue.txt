Well it's kinda the opposite for me as an European. The grass's always greener on the other side I guess.
What specific things did you miss out on because of this? Always love getting good Ideas on what I could do sometimes...

Yeah, a rocket launch must be spectacular. Hope I get the chance to see one some day. The SpaceX double landing looked amazing on video!
Theoretically it is possible to observe small traces of northern light here, however I haven't heard of any real sightings yet. We aren't really "up there" far enough for that, maybe you're thinking of Sweden?
But we got beautiful mountains and so many hills. Lots of great outdoor activities and most of them within walking / short driving distance.  I mean 20min to the city, 10min to bum-fuck- nowhere, 20min to the lake, 90min to the mountains, 10min to the next state and 30min to the country border. So many possibilities for interesting day trips. And we got so much old stuff. Parts of cities built centuries ago, churches much older than twice the age of the US, I bet I could even go out in my backyard, dig a few feet deep and find some ancient roman coins and stuff. I mean literally right in my town there were findings of old roman houses, how crazy is that :D

Yeah, Isle of man is definitely something I want to go check out. Nowhere near close enough for a weekend trip, however still much closer than you are.
There are no circuits and drag racing in general isn't really a thing here, at least not in Switzerland. However I can reach the German Autobahn in a 40min drive and there are multiple circuits across the border, so I can't really complain :D
