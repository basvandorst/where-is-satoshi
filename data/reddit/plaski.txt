The number is for KYC and stored in case someone audits/warrants them. If no one does that then the number will never see the light of day

100x this. Mycelium is what I recommend to every person I meet as well as trade with. It's so easy to use and the people running Mycelium are brilliant, always striving to be better.

You also said hasn't happened yet, which is has.

Debt cards can be bought and loaded with fiat, no need for a bank. Those debit cards could maybe be seen as a bank since you load BTC to the account and when you sell, the company sells the BTC and the USD is used for the purchase. Both don't need traditional banks to be used.

Used to use Coinbase exclusively, had A LOT of money going through them without a problem for a year and a half. Was verified fully and had the highest limits. Then one day they decided they needed even more of my info and reset my limits to the lowest level, so I dropped them like a bag of rocks. Now their competitor gets all of my fees and I haven't missed them once. It's a shame what they are doing
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:38:42
Depends on who you ask, I know a handful of people who don't use banks anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:28:06
It's not streamline by any means but they either use purse.io, sell locally for cash to buy visa debit cards, or spend on sites that accept BTC. Most used to have one of those BTC debit cards but all of them shredded them back when the BTC fork happened and that company fiasco happened.

I was more talking about the $2700 worth of clear bra that would be useless in order to remove the wrap.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:33:40
GBTC price has never and most likely will never follow the actual price of BTC as people are comfortable paying a premium due to it being tax free with Roths and the fact they dont have to worry about holding their own BTC.
PS: Its massively over priced but hardly anyone is selling so the standard 'Supply and Demand' rule works here.
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:56:36
Not only that but it has a clear bra on the wrap so if you want to remove the wrap, you must remove the bra too. Gets expensive real fast just to get it to stock.

Satoshi will make a statement, I'm actually very surprised he hasnt yet.
"But Satoshi hasnt been around blah blah blah"
This issue has been drug out too long and its splitting an already small group of people in the world, into smaller groups. If we want BTC to continue to grow, we can not have splits in opinions.
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:49:09
Hope this is not too late but I would sell GBTC and buy BTC. GBTCs premium hasn't been this large is percent difference of actual BTC, ever. Correct me if I am wrong but I'm very certain of that.

This is the correct way on paying taxes in the US.

They will take the coins that are still owed via BFX/RRT and then keep the rest. Since the hack, the price has risen quite a bit and BFX has paid back a small percentage to those that hold BFX/RRT. Well spoiler alert, Bitfinex owns a majority of BFX/RRT so they get to keep much more profit than expected.
Once the "investigation" concludes, we will get a better look on how all this played out.
BUT my bold prediction is that if they do end up getting the BTC back, they will drop the case and we will never know how the $73M loan.....I MEAN HACK, happened.

This is false. You are taxed when you mine, regardless if you sell or not.

For the US market? Think that's what people are asking above

What other exchanges allow fiat withdraws without KYC.. they got to know what bank account to send the fiat to
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:51:45
Sigwit can't be the reason. It needs 95% and we already know that is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the miner that must not be named
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:25:18
Can you link me to info on bitmains new site?
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:05:57
I'm not sure, once it was deemed not going to happened, I completely stopped all interest in it
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:49:10
Can you explain? I thought that one miner that owns more than 5% said absolutely no....
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:53:25
Licensing, overhead, moving of fiat, lawyers, ect.
It is a bit expensive but you pay for the convenience
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:47:58
I could see it this way.
Sell in store for USD. Buy BTC from someone using that USD. Cash out via exchange. Or if they are smart, sign up as a MSB and become a LBTC seller for a mark up.
I think that's enough steps for a bank to ask where you are getting this and you can say selling/trading crypto. Just need a bank that is okay with it

We can't compare the two. One was due to MtGox and the run down to the bottom (~180) was helped along by the guy washing 200M through BTCE

People freaking that China is "banning" BTC for the 15th time. Couple that with BFX scheduling maintenance times like narcolepsy patients schedule when they go to sleep.
Nothing new, buy the dip but watch for a dead cat bounce

It stops the on/off ramp. While it would be still possible to use BTC, it would cause enough hassle to deter others from getting into it when there isn't an easy way to move/cash thousands of dollars easily

Had problems for a while with them canceling orders on their end for no reason other than the basic "security" email they send out to any one. Then my bank started blocking money to coinbase for some reason and coinbase thought I had done it and took all of my limits away (had the highest possible). Have yet to get to my bank but you may want to check that end out to make sure they arent blocking money going to coinbase.

Very interesting to see how one stacks up against individual wallets. I'm certain most of the big holder have theirs in multiple wallets for risk sake but I've always wondered how many people have more holdings than I do and now I have a rough number!

Must've misunderstood your original post, does look like we agree

If in the US, it's super simple. Let's use BCH fork as an example. August 1st is your start date for tax purposes and your cost basis is $0. 
No value splits, no treating it like the original coin, no holding time grants.
The IRS is going to have a field day with crypto traders this tax season, do not try anything funny, it'll cause big time headaches

You wouldn't pay taxes until you sold them anyways so ownership wouldn't be forced in this case because as long as you didn't sell them, they aren't taxable
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:36:13
To be fair, they have overhead that many don't consider. Rent, BITXATM takes 1% of every transaction, insurance, volatility of the coins sitting on the machine, and cost of licensing in some places.

Before the halving? Im all for the price going up but I am willing to place a friendly bet with you of 0.5 BTC that the day before the halving it wont be $1200.

The last bubble percent change  compared to what we have seen from 1400 to now. Not even in the same ball park.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:06:00
If the timeline is the same as last time and this happens to be a bubble, we have roughly a week and a half til pop. 
I don't think we are in a bubble but media attention can cause it for sure.

Second time working with CashIntoCoins and have been waiting since around 12pm for my coins. Bit worrying when my only other transaction with this company was a month ago and I received my coins before I even got home from the bank.
