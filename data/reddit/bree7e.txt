Oh, I just talk about the topic. Why are you so angry ? The blockchain is the core logic in the creation of bitcoin. There is no doubt that some people have been cheated and fooled by many crypto coins. What should do is discover the nature of the things. I did't code any cryptocoins and projects,not to mention inviting someone.

Ps. Many countries domestic currency issue anchored USD. Because its powerful  existence, no matter what politics,economy,military and so on.Many counties think they can store the wealth through the USD based on the credit and power of US. There is a long way to go for the bitcoin or other coins.
