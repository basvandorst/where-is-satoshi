I don’t see banks going anywhere anytime soon. Ripple greatly increases the speed that long distance transactions take, and at the same time makes it cheaper to do so. From what it looks like, more and more banks will eventually adopt using it. It’ll be here to last. (Imo)

That’s the big one for me. I could’ve mined with my 1070 up till like January and would’ve made a pretty penny. But I was like “nah, it’ll burn out the card”
Edit: okay, couldn’t have mined on a 1070.  Makes me feel slightly better about being me ;) tbh I stopped looking into it after I decided I didn’t want to reduce my shiny GPU’s lifespan.

Laziness and not being old enough to open an account on Coinbase or similar sites.
 I think it would be interesting to do it but I haven’t had enough time to research how to store coins and such, and I don’t feel comfortable with the idea as a result of that.   I am gradually working towards it though, will probably but some Ripple and Ethereum soon.

They didn’t know it would, so they cut whir losses. Image of it dropped another k or two, who would be laughing now?

I thought nicehash was still down?
Edit: am looking into it
Edit again: yeah, still down but it’ll be back up soon.

Not really (for me). It’s the actual reason why it’s a crypto currency that makes me think it’s going to take off soon.

Woo Reddit motif squad!! 132 upvotes when I got buzzed. 
Anyway, are you asking for a friend?  This seems a weird question to think of out of the blue.
