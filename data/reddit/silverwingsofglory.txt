It's always surprising to me how many libertarians stroke their dicks about the "safety and security" quote when they don't know its origin or what it actually means.  
First of all, the quote is: "Those who would give up **Essential** Liberty, to **purchase** a little **Temporary** safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety" from the letter "Pennsylvania Assembly: Reply to the Governor", dated November 11, 1755.
Franklin isn't actually talking about personal liberty in the letter. He's writing as a Pennsylvania legislator to the Governor of Pennsylvania. The Governor was appointed by the very wealthy and powerful Penn family and was doing the Penn family's bidding in a matter. Basically, the Pennsylvania legislature wanted to tax the Penn family's lands to raise money for the militia to defend against the attacks of the French and Indian War. The Penn family didn't want to be taxed but were willing to give a large sum of money as long as the legislature agreed they wouldn't be taxed in the future. That's why the words "essential", "temporary", and "purchase" are important. He's literally talking about the Penn family trying to buy their way out of the ability of the Pennsylvania government being able to tax them (which he believes is an essential part of governance) for the temporary safety their payment would provide.  So it has nothing to do with personal liberty and is actually about the ability of the government to provide effective *long term* security through continued taxation.
So it pretty much means the opposite of what you're thinking.
