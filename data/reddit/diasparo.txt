Here’s the thing.
It wouldn’t be too difficult for someone to target specifically platforms you use, especially when the payout is 20k. If I was you I’d suck it up and take 1.99998 BTC over 0

Plus IIRC the Ledger’s hardware design offloads critical functions too a separate chip

This reads like a Boris Johnson quote

I think you’re thinking of the VIABTC accelerator. The head of VIABTC went all behind BCASH so don’t think he offers the service anymore

You're welcome :) I don't buy whim-wham with Bitcoin, I buy supplies for [wiff waff](

That’s a different thing, I was talking about the hardware. Hopefully the firmware is open sourced but the good thing is software can be patched, shipped hardware can’t.

Yeah. You can't really compare cryptos to stocks in too many ways, but the need to not have all your eggs in one basket is one way.


The capability of the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions - the biggest change coming would be increasing [SegWit adoption]( 
I can't find it now, but there's a post some guy makes daily here about Bitcoin's capability once Segwit is universal (something like 8000 transaction blocks). [Schnorr signatures]( are another important change that is upcoming.

I keep some still as it’s never not going to be the first, but realistically I’m probably going to continue to diversify out of it.
That is unless we see real progress with scaling.
I really hope exchanges begin moving off BTC pairings though
Edit: Downvotes - I'm not saying BTC pairings should be switched to BCH or something but to fiat. There's no reason, say, ETH or XRB should necessarily fall when BTC does except prices are pegged through BTC pairings.

Use [this]( data to calculate a fast fee and double spend if you need to. BlockCypher had the best predictor but it seems to have not changed in a while.

This makes a lot of sense, any source on the fee information (must have missed it)

For anyone wanting to read more about this, there is a BBC article somewhere of a small town in the UK. This town had basically one industry and when it faltered the economy was ruined. 
Along came companies offering  money for these people to act as directors, and they received a bit of cash every year for continuing to be a director, something like a fifth of the town took part.
It turned out it was an elaborate way to accept payments for adult entertainment without the banks getting suspicious - these companies owned by random people were used by porn sites to receive funds under some false statement of business
