Glad to hear someone is about to come out the other side of this. Did you have 2FA for login as well or just withdrawals? and were you allowed to trade during the 2 weeks or login at all?

Now try that with a different bank in another country that speaks a different language and have it there in less than ten minutes.

Just talked to MoosaNYC at btc-e he said if I fill out a support ticket, there is a 2 week unlinking process for 2FA and I should have everything back by then. Thanks for the help guys, I'll keep you updated if anything else happens.

The answer is simply that it serves its purpose well when WE as a society choose to accept it, which is all that needs to happen with BTC.
