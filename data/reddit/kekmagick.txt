bitcoin--zcash XCAT inoperability is coming! soon you'll be able to convert BTC-ZEC without an exchange. will be hilarious watching skry attempt to track!

gold salesman ...attempting to peddle his goods. imo, long term - gold will lose it's monetary value. only thing jim can do with bars of gold is sell-it-to-n00bs, and pay people to secure it.

better not have any opinions that might be outside the norm! they will shut-you-down financially for wrong think.

china's communist government has full control over chinese companies. all bitcoin companies in china - do as their told. BTC in current form is favorable for tracking - so it's not a threat. once zcash--bitcoin has XCAT interoperability; china will have much-less control!

cannot b&amp; bitcoin.. can make it illegal, but, that would've already happened. nowadays, large financial institutions have vested interest, and the trump administration's chock-full-of bitcoin supporters. next 8 years can guarantee you bitcoin will be safe from USG!
side note - if other countries attempt to make BTC illegal; it's a sign of weakness, and you should prolly short their national currency.

you just said "gold has nothing to do with central bank support", and very next post you discredited your own incorrect statement! absolutely matters who controls a commodity (especially when you don't know the exact amount of supply)?! .. after reading this; honestly, don't believe you should call anybody on this sub idiotic (projection)! didn't realize i was dealing with a child. good luck!

might've got my start slanging BTC on the streets - quick pro tips:
1) always meet in very public places (my favorite was always food courts in a local mall) post offices, local library work just-as-well. always preferred food courts because i'd have multiple escape routes.
2) never sell to anybody that tells you they're doing anything illegal! it's the feds! (or other police) even if they're not the feds - you wouldn't want to do business with a dumb criminal.
3) be armed - you're basically a bank - minus protection.
4) always arrive early to scope-out the terrain.
sure there's more, but these steps are the minimum to protect yourself! good luck, you're doing a great service!

gold's no different than shells, and beads the ancients utilized. gold is pretty-much worthless when it comes to 21st century commerce.
bitcoin's better than gold because we know total supply, it's invisible, weightless, easily divisible into smaller units, cheap to store, can be spent over the internet, or in person.

if the fed raised rates, the dollar should strengthen. 
thinking dude had this backwards.. should have the opposite affect: gold/BTC would gain value as the dollar weakens!

they're not overtly scamming, just always seem to have crappy ideas that don't pan-out.

@_date: 2017-03-02 17:22:04
good idea! USG can track their transactions on the block chain, identify them, and their networks! we'll utilize BTC as a tool to DEPORT all illegals! hope this happens!

ASIC hostile alt networks are less susceptible to centralization; ASICs are the slow death of an alt network. this will become more obvious over time.

reminder - gold will never be safe. government will confiscate your gold anytime it sees the need. if you try to hide it under your bed; good chance you'll be robbed (now confirmed)

if the ASIC's manufactured in china - the chinese government controls the manufacturer. nobody's doing anything in china without communist approval.
@_date: 2017-02-25 17:38:19
who do you think controls gold production, and exchange rates? certainly not commoner goldbug dipshits. lol
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:22:13
does this really deserve an announcement?
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:54:25
satoshi basically said this in an old post. (would take me a while to dig up specific quote), but satoshi understood specialized ASIC manufactures could cause a bottleneck that harmed decentralization. there's so few foundries, knew it would be trivial for a state (china) to control. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:51:16
doesn't matter - all altcoin money moves back into bitcoin at some point. this added velocity means alts are good for BTC! 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:38:14
shaking-out weak hands, before the next leg-up. never forget - gold, very-much like shells, and beads will lose monetary value over the long term. nobody cares about gold (especially young people) 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:03:52
side note - more fungible BTC becomes the more centralization BTC can handle. so, imo, after XCAT upgrade, the blocksize solution issues will be less of a problem. only a matter of time ; D 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:33:16
been through this many times with BTC - we'll be back; you'll be okay!
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:46:13
yes, ASICs can be stopped. problem's you'll need to convince all the people that invested in ASICs to lose all their money.
