i cant keep it straight whether we hate the msm carte blanche or if we are now proud of it being reported in the msm.

All you're doing is spouting r_the donald talking points. I dont give a shit if its breitbart or cnn or fox, there is shitty writing and there is fake news. 
You are objectively wrong despite what r_the donald feeds you to say about non-rightwing media.

The meaning of a word/phrase has nothing to do with either of our opinions on a sub, I'm saying the definition of that phrase has a specific and concrete meaning and you're not using it. The MSM may be biased but that doesnt make it fake news because they use phrases and report on topics that you dont like. 
Fake news is literally stuff made up, until you show me that every single thing on cnn.com is completely made up with no basis in reality and factually not even based on a real event then you are using "fake news" incorrectly. If non rightwing people scare you  then just be a man and admit it, instead of pretending factual things are "fake" because they hurt your fee fees.
I can't just start saying that the definition of "coca-cola" is now a lemon lime caffeine-free drink because I think Sprite tastes better than coca-cola. There is a meaning and its been agreed upon, no matter how upset that makes someone who disagrees with it.
This is obviously pointless, so I'll end it using your method of arguing and say: na na na na boo boo and plug my ears.

I agree that was a terrible call and embarassing but do you actually know what "fake news" means? This is not fake news, its shitty writing but not fake news

An exchange is not a zero sum transaction. I can't tell if you believe what you're saying or just want to argue

The SEC and people reading the comments are not idiots. Sure its not a good look but dont overemphasize his points here, as long as the list of positives from multiple people are weighed he'll be nothing more than an agenda driven interest.

I clicked on here thinking there was going to be some information outside of the proven fact directly invalidating this tweet/headline/statement.

Holy shit, I responded above but this place is insane. I really like hearing news and updates on bitcoin but it seems 1/3 to half of the posts here are these ridiculous tinfoil hat/ron paul conspiracy theorists whom actually know nothing about finance and markets. 
Like this is a objectively something you could learn freshman year in econ or a biz class.

My post says, "If you think they are going to operate in **THE US**" ... where did I say the US is the whole world?
Not only that but this post is a guy asking about a bitcoin service that works in the US. 
Have a seat.

If you think they are going to operate in the US without the "banksters" then I have some bad news for you.

The more I come to this sub the more im disillusioned with it. Really this is the direct answer to whatever OP is trying to implicate.
I really doubt many people here understand how the financial markets work outside of the "theyre bad!" "dont trust the govt" "gold and bitcoin or else youre a sucker" type responses that are just reactive responses to a Ron Paul interview they listened to on youtube.

Can you provide context as to why he is so against it? I havent been on any of the boards so im unaware of the drama.
