Ya Bitcoin isn't really anything different. And honestly, it's probably not even as good as the US dollar backing. 
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:52:42
Currency always inflates. There's no way around that. What backs the US dollar is the millions of people that trust it within the US and the billions elsewhere. Unless Bitcoin gets real stable no one is going to trust it.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:02:30
Sure a small percentage. But I would assume a vast majority of people use Bitcoin as a get an investment rather than a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:34:24
Absolutely. Use of currency is as important as value of the currency.

Doesn't mean it's not fucked up. "Cant wait till everyone else suffers so I can prove that what I believe in is right". sociopaths. At that point you've completely missed the point.

That's kind of fucked up man.

Honest question here. If the govt and the dollar collapse and our economy is in turmoil will we all have access to the internet to even be able to use bitcoin?

This right here is my biggest issue with Bitcoin. It must have a robust power grid.

Fucking Christ this is idiotic. Bitcoin feels like a fucking pyramid scheme with comments like that.

Because Venezuela is a terrible example of a a fiat currency. This has happened plenty of times in history. Also what percentage of venezuala has power to even use Bitcoin. Last I checked they're turning to the US dollar. These bullshit claims aren't helping bitcoin. They make it sound like a bullshit scheme. Let it win by proving itself. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:11:58
There's some pretty big jumps here and I think it's hard for people to take Bitcoin seriously with articles like this.

Thank you. This is what infuriates me about these posts. OP doesn't even understand that this is a good thing, but rather calls it a bad thing....

Okay. This was pathetic. Some encryptions for current banking systems use 1000+ bit encryption.

You should care about the volatility. Trust/faith in a currency is what makes it a currency. Volatility does not inspired trust.

Sorry, when I say "take off" I mean as a full on currency with the US dollar being obsolete. 
Most of fiat is digital, but I can still use cash. Cash is still king. 
The very fact that you say 1 million dollar Bitcoin is my entire point. You're "rich" because that Bitcoin is worth 1 million dollars. Not because it's worth 1 Bitcoin. It's a frame of reference. Additionally I understand no one expect Bitcoin to reach 22K and it got a lot of people's attention, but a million dollars for a Bitcoin will only happen if the US dollar completely collapses. It's not going to get there in the current market. And if it does I can promise you it won't be even remotely stable.

Listen Im no expert in economics but I know enough to say that a little inflation isn't bad and can be arguably beneficial to an economy. 
I think Bitcoin is cool but I don't think it'll ever take off like people want. 
1. It's treated as a get rich quick scheme
2. It's digital. What do I do when the power is out of the internet goes down in a natural disasters or war. We need physical coin. 
3. If you think ANY govt is going to let a currency be it's main currency without regulation is ignorant. We're already seeing manipulation of Bitcoin. The big spike was a pump and dump.
4. It's so volatile. I guess we should expect this to happen. But it's not like exactly reassuring. I'd much rather invest in something that depreciates than something that will double in value on day, then drop in value the next. I'd also argue a lot of that volatility is people trying to get rich quick. 
Nonetheless I think Bitcoin is very interesting but I don't think it'll ever be the answer.
Edit: slowly depreciates
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:57:01
That sounds a bit culty

So around 700 BC when gold coins started being used they were measuring it's electrical conductivity? No. Why don't we use uranium instead. It's impossible to inflate because it's always decaying.

@_date: 2018-04-28 16:00:36
Really 1 and 2 go hand in hand. My statement that going from sub 1000 to 22k, and 8k to 700k is not the same thing. Using percentages here is really a massive over simplification. Brutally, "it" did not happen last year. A business grows it's net worth to 100k in the first year when it started with 1000. Lets just say whatever you make costs  you $100 and you sell with 75% profit margins. Doable. Make a bit over 300 sales and youre there. Now does growing by 1000% the next year to 1M. Probably not. If so, does it grow to 1B the next? Surely not. Making the assumption that 1000% growth is stable is ignorant. And that's really my main point. People will say, "ya well nobody thought it would grow by 3600% last year", and that's there reasoning for it doing the same thing again next year! Tell mw that's not terrible logic. "ya well you know, I like, won the lottery last year, didn't think it'd happen, doubt it'll happen again, but that's why I still play, because I didn't think it'd happen the first time." 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:12:52
I think you're wrong there. I'd say more than 70% of the people I know that claim it's the greatest thing ever didn't even know what it was 3 years ago. Shit, if a bunch of people suddenly started winning the lottery over and over again, you'd be damn sure they'd say everyone should play. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:10:20
Google Bitcoin price. Check out the coindesk value chart. Change it between 3months 1 month, a day, an hour. Look how much it fluctuates. It's a very volatile stock essentially. That volitility, that's called risk. There's a very big chance I'll make money, but there's also a really good chance I'll lose a lot. Therefore it's risky  All those people who bought in at 15K, they got nailed by the risk fairy when Bitcoin popped. Ideally Bitcoin would smooth out eventually, and in all fairness you'd expect something like this with a new currency that doesn't really have a place, but nonetheless, I can confidently say you don't want you economy based on something so risky. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:12:32
1. Find a better argument than it happened last year. 
2. Jumping from 50 to 22k is not the same as jumping from 8k to 700k. Big percentage jumps are much easier when numbers are smaller. 
3. I think the face of bitcoin has changed a lot. I think a lot of people lost a lot of money by buying in at the top. People will be more cautious when buying in which will slow growth. Also...who's gonna realistically buy in at 200k. Sure I only buy 1000 in Bitcoin, but the yield will be much less and the get rich quick vibe will diminish. 
4. The IRS is going to get their fingers in this somehow. They need too. We have to pay taxes. That'll just complicate the while thing and some people will turned off by it. 
5. I could be wrong and it could happen. These are just my initial thoughts when someone boldly claims a very large number. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:04:18
Apparently 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:43:26
That's a fair point. My argument still stands. People justify the possibility simply by stating that no one thought 22k would happen. When I come to this subreddit I want to find people that give me a real reason why it will grow to 1 mil, and not just hopefully fantasies based off a surprise bubble a year ago. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:12:19
Who the hell is going to buy in at 100k a Bitcoin? Not the average American. Nor the average person on Earth since just about every American is in the top 1% of the world. Sure let's say 100k Bitcoin. Okay I'll buy in for 3k. Oh wow look the market went up 1%. Definitely not 500% like Bitcoin is used too. 1 mil is not going to happen. And I hope you also realize that a 1 million dollar Bitcoin. Is 1/5 of the world's GDP. Think about that. It's not happening. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:44:58
I don't know. There's a shit load of risk in Bitcoin. I don't think they're just gonna throw money into Bitcoin without being pretty damn sure they'll profit.

What don't I get? Explain. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:40:26
I think a pretty big problem with Bitcoin is that 99% of the people who've bought in at this point are using it as a stock investment to get rich in their respective currencies. When Bitcoin hit 20k, people were selling left and right. I also don't think you want a cirency as volatile as Bitcoin. Not saying it can't smooth out, but the perception of Bitcoin has to completely change before that happens and I thinks that's going to be harder than people want to admit. What can you realistically do with Bitcoin in an economy. The more volatile it is the less companies are going to want to use it. Companies want to get rich yes, but they're equally concerned with risk mitigation and Bitcoin is nothing but insane risk. But I could be 100% wrong. We shall see.
