Thats the eternal struggle.  Money IS emotional to most people.  As a long time trader, its still difficult to completely separate the two.

Doesn't the nano S ship with a recovery sheet that enables you to restore the wallet?  What if the seller looks at these before sending them out to people?  Can you restore some other custom way instead.of the recovery sheet?  Seems silly to include that.  The potential for physical attack before you even get the device is high.  Am I understanding it wrong?  You guys got me all interested in these now.

Frustrating because ive been telling people to buy for 4 years and everyone thought I was insane to say BTC will be in the 10s of thousands.  Now all those sae people are asking me how to buy
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:22:48
Everyone talks pump but not alot of cloak and dagger talk.  It WILL correct.  My estimate is 5K on the low end, 8K on the high end.  Ive seen the falling knife before.  To think it won't happen again is foolish.  Truth.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:27:28
Its all about 20K now. Just forget about 15K, never gunna happen.  
Or jump on the million dollar BTC by 2020 bandwagon.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:04:54
I can't deny the ecosystem is quite different today than it was back then.  Nobody knows when the correction will occur, of course. However, after being in crypto a while and seeing all sides of it, I can't rule out hefty market manipulation as the main rise in BTC.  I think much more "average Joe" money is getting in, but they are only getting in because of the $$$ flashing at them.  Its all over the media, a frenzy has started, which is exactly what the manipulators sought out to create.  Now they have average people spending their hard earned money on over pumped coins.  Its like a forum thread that has gone mainstream and every fanboy is calling moon.  Unfortunately those fanboys are the now the mainstream media, so the credibility is much higher than the newbie account screaming moon.  I know my theory is a little" tin foil hat", but I cant completely rule it out.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:46:57

If you are going to call me out at least explain.  My understanding is lightning hubs are centralized

Lightning is centralized.  Key fact here.  BTC and crypto represents the exact opposite.

@_date: 2017-12-06 11:53:33
Day trading is great if you can accurately guess the price movements.  But you are right.  I think in most cases people are better off HODLing
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:43:23
Be very very careful telling friends and family to invest.  It can backfire hard.
Case in point I told a buddy to buy at around 1K befoe the first crash from 1.2K to $200.  He gave up and sold at a terrible loss, even though now he would be up X12.  We arent the same since......be careful
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:46:00
I cannot deny that fact.  You are 100% correct.  "Average Joe" adoption is up greatly since back in the day.  However, you cannot deny the fact that it is possible that we are seeing one of the biggest market manipulations in history.  Im not saying it is, but if you have been around the block with crypto can you really not have that thought in your head?  What I see is merely a transition of "forum fanboys" to mainstream media.  Everyone is calling moon.  If ive learned anything its that you sell when people are cheering and buy when they are bleeding.  I am very interested to see how.it plays out.  Obviously I hope for the same outcome as you, but have my reservations because of the knowledge I have about the seedy underside of Crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:28:09
Perhaps they did it to inspire other people to give as well.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:41:48
Of course, if we all had the answers it wouldn't be called speculation.  All I'm saying is that I have seen the knife drop and it was the same scenario.  Everyone is shouting moon and emotions are high.  And then the dagger came......
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:50:10
What is USD? .......is what my children will be asking
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:19:07
If you have been around since $5 then surely you saw it lose 83% of its value in about a month and a half in 2014.  Saying it can't and won't happen again is pure ignorance.  You are in a completely unpredictable market and have zero control over the outcome.  Big balls to be "sure" in such a market.
Edit: before you flame, I am a btc holder and long time backer as well.  I'm just a realist when it comes to market predictions
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:45:42
If it can simply be restored with a seed then this no more secure than an electrum wallet.  Just another piece of hardware to break or have vulnerabilities.

@_date: 2017-12-06 11:55:11
If you had to pick one online wallet, Coinbase is good because they are apparently FDIC insured for your fiat.  Not sure about BTC.  Best choice is ALWAYS being in control of your keys
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:01:17
Would you rather get $120,000 or 0 dollars?  Seems like a no brainer to me.  You would really trust someone on reddit with your wallet that has 150K? At the least the guy is reputable from the website?  Not sure.

I would call this a paper cut and not blood in the streets.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:18:52
Mine was a calculated amount based on the strongly backed "hooker to blow" ratio.  Scientists have been struggling for years so obtain the definitive formula.  Some say you need more blow than hookers, some say more hookers and less blow.  What exactly is the ideal ratio?  Through my calculations the correct mental threshold is no less than 12712.13.  Anything less will result in agitated, unwilling hookers because of the limited blow supply.  Everyone knows the ideal ratio is: (1/2g blow) x (# of hookers).  Don't forget the high tolerance of your most seasoned hookers and up it goes to 3/4g blow per hooker if you wish to obtain optimal ratios.  I find anything else can either lead to psychotic cheap motel room hooker breakdowns, or what is often referred to in the industry as "blue balls".  Any thoughts?

Very informative.  Thank you.  I guess my question would be what is a "modest" amount of BTC?  For most new adopters it may be financially waaaay out of their grasp.  So in a sense, its centralized to the people that can afford it.  Am I wrong?

I'm pretty sure the IRS is only worried about fiat transactions. Cash flow into BTC and cash out of BTC.   Theres no possible way you could determine loss/gain on an altcoin/BTC transaction because not only is BTC fluctuating every second, but so is the altcoin.

This is true only if they keylog your password and don't have 2FA setup.  You obviously need to practice good security by never downloading anything from unknown sources and always verify every signature.  Or you could go setup a separate OS install that you use for your btc wallet and NOTHING else.

We are talking about determining what "value" the 10 coins he won are

Electrum is fine as long as you back up your seed in an encrypted fashion with strong passwords.
