the representation of BCH as Bitcoin is the definition of a scam. is correct.
If I told you that I was selling you american dollars, then sold you zimbabwean dollars, youd be within your rights to want your money back as what I gave you didn't match what I described to you. It's the same here.

Fair. But the DAO itself has been delisted from MtGox etc. It's hard to not argue that BCH is on another level though:
1) The name Bitcoin Cash is misleading in itself as it makes it look like a Bitcoin-affiliated project.
2) The biggest, currently active proponents of BCH are operating a co-opting campaign the likes of which would see them sued to the ground if they tried this with an actual organisation.

Ethereum isn't being bolstered by misleading and scammy tactics though.

We are all perfect in hindsight, but when those things were happening no one knew where it was going to end

I did the same thing. I bought in at ~$10k just before the crash 2 years ago. I waited 18 months before selling for ~30-40% profit once the bubble started rising again. I now have a pot of money im waiting to reinvest. Patience will get you far.

To 'short' something is the 'sell high' part of the 'buy low, sell high' mantra common in trading. It assumes said mantra to be a cycle,  I.e: you sell at a high price, wait for it to crash and then buy back in.

It's never a bad thing to keep your eggs in many baskets :) no one knows what the future may hold.

It helps to think about the profits you *will* be making when you sell at a higher price than you bought in at over the profits you *could* be making if a bull run continues. Bull runs don't last forever and if you're making a tidy profit, you aren't losing.
