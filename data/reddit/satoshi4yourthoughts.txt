Since the space is going to get a lot of coverage in 2018 following the milestones reached by BTC in 2017 and the ever growing market cap it can go one of two ways :
Up- influx of interest and new comers into the scene driving market cap and price upwards
Down- governments panicking and enforcing restrictive legislation, taxation ..etc
try to weigh your own pros and cons research the nay-sayers and their arguments and assess whether you feel they are valid. 
I personally believe Q1 2018 will be the rise of altcoins since there are alot of upcoming announcements and marketing events planned there will be some speculative trading going on and high possibility of making a buck. But you got to research your investments read read read. Golden rule dont invest anything your not willing to lose. 
not the answer your looking for just my 2 cents
