Maybe not the joke, but certainly the boat.

Wow, I was wondering what happened to half the conversation. But I see there are some Napoleon complexes that had to vote chunks of the conversation down so far, that they no longer appear. Fabulous!

Rising out of $400 feels ok to buy; rising out of $600 feels bad.

I'm not talking about the bitcoin system itself, I meant securing the wallet server side and preventing the interception of transactions. The node bitcoin libraries out there have a ways to go yet in these areas.

I've bought some bitcoin very casually. Now I've found something I'm interested in spend them on. Nothing important, but a chance to use them. Well gee, I bought around $600, so I will actually be paying more for goods/services due to price. 
So I have to ask why would people run to bitcoin when it is useless as a store of value?
I know, I know, I'll have a different tune when it goes back up; but that is not the point. If I'm used to purchasing something regularly for $7.95, I don't want to spend $18.98 one month and $4.95 the next month. that's way more work, now that I need to time my purchases and figure bulk purchases, etc. Shoot, should I start hedging my bitcoin holding with other currencies and start doing weekly swaps? lol.

I've read a bunch of times that this version not to be used in production, but no recommendation of which version is ok for production.

Huh? But cash is legal tender. So if someone saved $18K in a jar over a decade and finally found a boat they wanted to buy, when they show up to buy said boat for $18K in cash, they would be breaking the law?
I've known several people who saved change in excess of $10K and at some point purchased and automobile, and these folks where obviously some of the most financially responsible people I have ever met.

Exactly, but if you only purchase at high prices, you don't get the benefit of averaging.

Prohibitive as in it was $200 last November.

My post is the definition of trying not to throw my money around stupidly.

I don't believe $50 bitcoin is long gone. The current price has all the indicators of a bubble.

"Confirm shipping details" button does nothing - on several browsers. Was going to buy...
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:24:59
Wow, DB much?
Of course I could've been more specific in my question. Maybe does anyone buy at this price for the long term?
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:04:49
I don't mind the rough too much. Just looking to see what different people think. What do I search for, "idiot that asks the same question"? And will it be relevant to what I'm thinking today?
I appreciate your reply, and all of the replies!
@_date: 2014-10-08 13:50:33
Thank you for the great response! That is a very good solution. I want to stay away from any GUI applications if I can, but I am going to explore your way a little more. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:35:05
That is rather cool.

I apologize, your highness, for being less than fully knowledgeable and confident in bitcoin. I apologize for wasting you precious time as I try to solicit at-the-moment feedback about the current market. Please do not chastise me for my ignorance, your highness.

Thanks platypii!
It looks like security in bitcoin payment is still a rather untraveled area.

I get no response. I fill out that same page with my withdrawal addresses 3 times a day.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:55:59
They'll never be $10k per coin. It wouldn't be useful as normal currency at that price. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:57:09
Really. Are your drawers on so tight that you can't enjoy a bit of creativity? Do you beat little kids and small animals with your cane as well?
And actually, it has everything to do with bitcoin. What else does it have to do with? Nowhere else other than bitcoin is there a Bearwhale.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:17:27
Because folks more experienced/involved with bitcoin might have a more informed opinion.
