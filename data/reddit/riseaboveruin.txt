I still don't understand how bitcoins work.  I've watched a ton of the videos on the wiki. How is there a finite number of bitcoins?  How do you know what that number is?  What the fuck is a bitcoin?

Humble brag?  Like.. to get your point across didn't need you adding your own income to the equation lol.  Gtfo

Has anyone gone to jail for stealing BTC yet?  How would you even prove it?

3 months ago was supposed to be the all time high, and people said the same thing.  Maybe you're just an asshole that doesn't know where Bitcoin is going just like me?
I'm looking for an answer here from a knowledgeable Bitcoin investor that has a firm grasp on the current direction of Bitcoin based on current events.  That doesn't sound like you.

Is now a good time to buy?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:45:14
I was going to invest a decent chunk of change back in June, I'm kicking myself now for not pulling the trigger.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:50:26
So let me get this straight.  You just told me I'm an idiot for inquiring about buying at an all time high, when you literally just admitted that you did exactly that 2 months ago?
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:13:46
So what you're saying is when it drops down to around 1250 or lower would be a good time to invest?

Yeah I read that article it was like 50 pages on snopes.com or something about how the FBI shut down silkroad online, but they HAD to catch him with his laptop open while actively monitoring both his online activity and his physical activity with their own eyesight, AND they had to be able to get his laptop from him before he could close it.
They definitely didn't frame him.  But I don't think it's as easy as pointing a finger at someone and saying they took your Bitcoins.  Especially since you can cycle it through anonymous accounts before sending it to yourself or cashing it in.
There's a reason people pay with bitcoins to purchase illegal goods and services.

Pardon my ignorance, I haven't been keeping track of what's going on, but why was it 600$ before and why will it never be 600 again?   Why is it 1900$ now?

How would Bitcoin being used in the other way, the visa way, affect the digital currency gold value of Bitcoin?  Can you elaborate? 
@_date: 2016-07-29 20:48:55
The way you worded it shows your bias towards bitcoins holding their currency value in a kind of no brainer kind of way, can you rephrase it in a way that shows both sides of the argument because I still feel like I'm not getting the full picture. 
Sorry if that sounded blunt, I appreciate you taking the time to reply nonetheless.  I have about 400$ in Bitcoin right now so I am vaguely familiar with the concepts you're referring to.
