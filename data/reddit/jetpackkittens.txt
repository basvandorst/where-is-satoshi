My friend got me into crypto currency a month or so ago. As a complete noob, I am finding all of this drama fascinating. Giving one person's word over something seems bizarre to me. Bitcoin just doesnt seem to be going away anytime soon. If anything it is a great time to buy in to me. I wish I had got involved when sites were giving away free bitcoin just to get it started! I am excited about the future of this currency.

Sweet. I did as well. One thing I have learned so far is to take other people's advice and comments with a grain of salt. I am going to try to buy 25 - 50 a week in btc until I hit about 1000 and then start buying some alts. I mined like 9 Eth about a year ago and sold them. Im kind of bummed about that now LOL. Only advice I have is to hold  whatever you have and just forget about it. I am going to think of crypto like buying scratch off tickets or something. Maybe it will pay off someday or maybe I just had fun wasting money.

Hold it and forget about it. Check back in on it 3 years from now. Then buy a new car.

LOL yup. I had 150 btc the other day. Now I got like 140 or something. So... I basically just need to buy another 50 dollars on Friday LOL. I love btc. I'm just going to throw money at it until God speaks to me.
