I would expect there's a high load for the network every time a block is released. I can imagine the network then is waiting "idle" for the next block to be found? Increasing the block size would indeed increase the load each time it's found. But if we lower the timespan the processing could perhaps be more evenly spread in time?
Other downside is perhaps that the block reward would need to be halved as well.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:17:53
I'm sure Bitcoin devs are aware of this direction. Just hope it's not a requirement to run a full node with such low bandwidth. :|
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:37:19
It wasn't about a scaling solution. It was about the value of a configuration setting (constant value) already existent in the Bitcoin software. The setting was set to 1MB. If core would have agreed to increase the setting to 2MB everybody would be happy and BCH would not have spawned into existence.
Even if Lightning does take off making Bitcoin Core the global digital currency. 1MB might still not be sufficient. They may still need to increase the value even with Segwit and Lightning.
Solutions like Lightning are very cool. But such solutions *shouldn't be* be made interdependent with Bitcoin. With the max blocksize set to 1MB Bitcoin Core is forcing their offchain solution to be dominant. While in a free world Bitcoin should better be a facilitating layer. There could be a multitude of solutions like Lightning spawned into existence with healthy competition and adoption. Bitcoin is basically saying: "There can be only one offchain solution. And we're dictating which one it will be."
Considering Bitcoin Core is now irreversibly tied to Lightning. You can safely say that combination is much further deviated from Satoshi's original vision. Bitcoin Cash resembles it much closer since its solution is based on the throbbing heart of Bitcoin. Namely the blockchain technology itself.
Note that the people who took over from Satoshi himself. Who worked with Satoshi. Gavin and Mike. They both support bigger blocks.
Also note that increasing the blocksize would not have blocked anyone from starting a Lightning network. Such ideas are on the table for Bitcoin Cash as well. 
Then to think this entire warfare within the Bitcoin community could have simply been resolved by changing a configuration setting from 1MB to 2MB.

So I will be needing to open a channel to my girlfriend, my parents, my sister, my friends, my coffee-shop, my gas station, my supermarket. 7 x $15 = $105? But hopefully transaction fees will be lower by then.
Also. If I have opened up a channel. And my funds are running low. Do I need to make another transaction every time I want to add more funds? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:04:59
Changing the size would've meant the value isn't set in stone. BCH would not have existed. 
It needs to be adjusted to whatever the current load is. You can even lower it again (less than 1MB!) as soon as some form of compression and/or offchain solution is *proving* to offload the blockchain sufficiently.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:39:51
Thank you for the detailed explanation. It has affected my point of view somewhat. :)
I understand I can choose whatever software + network I prefer. But there's plenty of reasons why it would be preferable to upgrade BTC as opposed to have all these forks. No brand confusion. Keeping the community united. Easy adoption for merchants. In the end the goal is to have a global digital currency. There will most likely be only 1 or 2. 
I'm not convinced that the current state of bitcoin is caused through active consensus. Perhaps the consensus model is crippled and preventing bitcoin to move forward. 
The network can provide consensus. But there needs to be a driving force for innovation. I think the only ones who can do that are the software developers like Bitcoin Core. They need to push and facilitate the changes. 
I'm sure it wont be easy to get +50% percent consensus for any update that requires a hardfork. Most likely: The bigger the update - the bigger the change - the more pushback you'll get. People don't like change. That's also why so many people still use old Windows and Android versions. If it ain't broke indeed. 
I think it's not ideal that the mechanism to provide consensus is through installing a certain software program. Most people don't pick a client because that's how they want to "vote". That's not the purpose of doing a software release. Maybe they just prefer the user interface colors. Many people might be unintentionally maintaining the status quo. 
I think it would be better to have the consensus model built into the bitcoin "protocol" somehow. For example. A nice update would be a simple "consensus provider" system like:
* [v] "Vote + enable feature X for next 1000th block when consensus &gt; 60%"
* [ ] "Vote + enable feature Y for next 1000th block when consensus &gt; 60%"
Each node/miner then broadcasts its user agent including some flags that represent the "vote + enabled" features. Similar to how browsers do it:
* Satoshi:0.15.1 [feature_X_voted] [feature_Z_enabled]
If you are okay with some feature you enable it. But as long as nobody else does, it remains deactivated on your client. Only once the majority of people have the option enabled will the feature be activated on all the nodes that had it set to enable. A coordinated hardfork occurs at the next predefined "hardfork slot block" with &gt; 60% consensus.
Something like that.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:38:05
That's cool. But it's not what's causing the transaction fees to go down, right?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:09:21
Thanks for clarifying.
If my transaction to my sister runs through the supermarket. Will the supermarket be able to see me and my sister made that transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:38:35
It's not too bad. Some banks charge the same just for making a transaction. \*Ducks away\*
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:24:26
I'm not sure this is a good sign. Usage is shrinking. Total transactions are down to February 2017 levels:
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:28:15
Not opposed at all. It's a really cool concept. 
I think the best comparison is with caching solutions. When webbrowsers use caching it offloads the internet because you don't need to download each file multiple times when the same file was already downloaded some time before. It works very well.
It becomes ridiculous when the maintainers of the software that runs the internet have hardcoded a rate limiter into the internet forcing you to upgrade your browser to use their caching solution. Especially considering:
* The caching solution is not yet finished.
* Even when it's finished. It will take some time before it's widely adopted. 
* Even when it's widely adopted. It might not offload the network sufficiently. We might still need to increase the bandwidth anyway.
* The rate limiter is set to 7Kb/second while the infrastructure is capable of at least 8 times that speed.
* The rate limiter is turning the available bandwidth into a scarcity. Driving up the price if you want to use it. So you need to pay $15 for every page you want to see.
* There's a lot of competing software looking to become the new standard. They are currently gaining market share simply by increasing their rate limit (even though their solution might be inferior).
* It's a client side solution. Is it a good idea to have core developers abandoning their project to work on a caching solution? To foster a healthy ecosystem, better have the good ideas emerge themselves in a free market manner. There's plenty of vendors out there.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:59:39
Thank you for your explanation/opinion/point of view. :)
Yes, technically SegWit allowed to compress more transactions into 1MB blocks, right?
So is it true that the network is currently voting not to increase the size? Is it really what the majority actively wants? Or is this more a case of everybody being passive about it? 
My opinion: I guess since there have been zero hardforks so far, it's perhaps (been) a good time as any to do the first one with something not too complicated. Bitcoin has no future without doing at least one. Seems to me it's more a matter of being graced with a good opportunity. Something like blocks being full. We really should be wanting this to happen I think?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:00:36
Sounds interesting. :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:08:14
Indeed. You don't need to download the entire blockchain before Bitcoin is usable either. 
update: Okay, who downvoted that? :)
update  Second downvote. My argument is valid. I've made plenty bitcoin transactions without running a full node. You don't need to download the entire blockchain to make a transaction. You can test this yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:19:19
True. Though if one exchange switches on its batching technology. I would expect to see a sudden sharp drop in transactions. It wouldn't be going down gradually. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:47:43
Ah yes. Apparently it's achieved with the Sphinx protocol:
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:20:52
Question: Why not decrease the block time from 10 minutes to 5 minutes? More blocks per hour means more transactions. 
As Bitcoin becomes more popular the network will have to deal with more transactions. There's no way around it. Nodes will need to do more work. 
Lightning network is great for payments. But 90% of volume is currently caused by trading. Will lightning payment channels be useful with trading transactions at the exchanges?
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:32:36
That's great. Good to see exchanges using the system more efficiently. We'll have to wait a bit longer to see if Segwit and Lightning are having effect.

@_date: 2018-01-30 12:29:41
The estimated total transaction value per day has been going down as well:
Could be caused by exchanges as well of course. Would be interesting to see what percentage of total transaction value is caused by exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:04:27
TIL: Bitcoin has never done a hard fork. 
I disagree you would want to put many things in each hardfork. In software engineering that's called the "big bang" approach. Usually it's better to do many smaller changes incrementally. Do continuous delivery. 
I guess a hardfork will be as difficult as how radical the changes it brings? Perhaps it would help to make a hardfork less "hard"?
I could imagine the hardfork wouldn't actually increase the blocksize just yet. Leave the blocksize at 1MB so that everyone is backwards compatible with older clients. But only make it configurable. Then as soon as sufficient clients are upgraded the update could be triggered in various ways.
* A vote by miners
* A vote by users
* Aroadcasting a special transaction on the network
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:10:40
I'm afraid Lightning hasn't started yet. It's still in the testing phase. It is currently not yet used for micropayments. It's currently not the cause of lower transaction fees.
But feel free to downvote my comments if you want me to delete them. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:30:16
I totally agree with you here. :)
So that's why people started BCH. I don't understand why you're so against it? 
Roger Ver is not the leader of BCH. He's just a guy who likes it. The community is much larger and consists of many more respectfull people who believe in what Satoshi started. People who previously supported BTC. 
The Bitcoin community is so big when you add up both teams. Yet only a few people are taking a hard-line position with the blocksize. Is the 1MB really worth the warfare within the community? It doesn't make sense. 
Hopefully we'll all reunite in the future somehow. 
Wish you the best!

What's the use running a full node if you can't pay the transaction fees?

Come on guys. This shouldn't be your top post! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:57:46
Option 1) You can send 1MB to 1000 nodes for processing.
Option 2) You split up the network and send 500KB to 500 nodes each. 
With option 2) you need to send half the size to only half the network for processing. You achieve the same with only 25% of the total resources. You can further improve by splitting into more threads.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:03:22
You don't send across threads. You send on your own thread to a particular wallet. But at the end of every cycle the threads (including transactions) are merged back into the root Bitcoin thread. This might require some "merge blocks" for each thread.
My knowledge about Bitcoin inner workings is limited. I just had the idea and thought to share. Hoping someone with deeper knowledge can tell if it would be an interesting direction. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:38:14
Are you sure they need to be? It's just Bitcoin blockchain forking and merging back in a timely manner. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:02:05
I fail to see the importance to be able to pay from multiple addresses in a single transaction. The simple solution is to do multiple transactions. The threading solution still wins if multiple transactions (on separate threads) are still cheaper than the other solutions. Which look awfully complicated and expensive to me. 
Threading would scale bitcoin at the core. Give it a heartbeat. Each thread would be lean and allow for fast and cheap transactions in true Bitcoins. And doesn't require 3rd parties, layers or introduce extra currencies like lightcoin. 
The lightning network has a whole bunch of other limitations and needless complexities. 
Multithreading would also work with the existing mining network. It's my understanding Lightning does not. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:30:14
You'd suddenly need 26% to hijack a thread (if there's just 2 threads). But if one group would be so powerful we probably wouldn't have a scalability problem. Alternatively there would be an option to disregard a specific thread for one cycle in the merging process. Or implement ways to split certain miners onto separate threads. So perhaps it allows for more counter measures?
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:56:33
Here's what's outrageous. Bitcoin is now stuck at maximum 7 transactions per second with each transaction costing 5 dollars. It can currently do max 600.000 transactions per day. Hardly sufficient for a global cash system. 
With the scalability problem solved we should see far cheaper transaction costs. With the global payment potential we should also see a huge raise in the Bitcoin value. 
But you're right. You better have your coins in a single wallet if you're planning to spend to multiple addresses. It's up to the user. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:12:49
Miners can decide for themselves which thread they pick up for the next cycle. They can switch between threads depending on criteria. The rewards on a "busy thread" may be different.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:43:06
Iterating on the idea further I was thinking that there would simply be multiple blocks created (every 10 minutes) in stead of the one single current block.
Thank you for pointing it out. It seems indeed to go into the direction of sharding:
 
* Next block cycle begins
* A number of shards is determined based on calculation
* Miners choose which shard they will try to mine
* As soon as all shards are mined the next cycle can begin
Partitioning the transactions into each belonging shard could perhaps be done by modulus:
decimal(tx_input_hash) % number_of_shards = shard_id_for_tx_for_cycle_x
When the first shard is found it will need to wait until all other shards are finished since there might be transactions that might have affected the next cycle.
This would also offload the validating process since not all shards would be completed simultaneously. The workload is spread in time (as opposed to have everything in a single block).
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:40
haha, sorry man. I'm very much aware this idea is very rough. It just came to light and thought I would share before I forget about it. Also wanted some feedback to see if it's interesting to investigate further. Maybe it already exists, for example.
A mining pool may have a big share of resources. But they aren't automatically a coordinated unit.
Your arguments about pools is interesting. Since there's only one block to mine every 10 minutes you want to have a big mining pool to be the first.
In the case of multiple smaller blocks in separate threads the difficulty can be lowered. Meaning there's a bigger chance to find a valid block with less resources. Also mining pools will likely split their resources onto each thread. Meaning smaller pools become interesting too.
My proposal actually already exists in a different form. It's why we currently have 1000 altcoins. It's the organically grown answer to the Bitcoin scalability problem.
Considering an altcoin as just a "bitcoin thread". They don't suffer from the 51% attack vector either. There's plenty of pools who have more resources than 51% of some of the altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:08:54
Blockchain threads. As if there's multiple temporary independent instances of Bitcoin running each generating their own blocks and with their own pool of miners. It would effectively be a bunch of temporary altcoins pegged onto Bitcoin.

It's totally okay if you don't know the answer. :)
Bitcoin wallets don't suffer from this limitation since you don't need to make a connection to Alice to transfer funds. Bob simply connects to the blockchain network. Which is always online. So you can install a wallet on your mobile phone and be good to go. 
The whole point of Lightning is to offload the network. The idea is that Alice and Bob can make off-chain transactions between each other directly.
I know this seems like an absurd problem. But seriously. You can't make a connection to a mobile phone over the internet.

Or have some relay service like WhatsApp. 
Or use some other transport layer. Like sending some transaction file through email or Telegram.

Everything is tied to Bitcoin. Look at the market. It's exactly like you say. Altcoins are simply the organic answer to the scalability problem of: The One True Bitcoin. 
I'm not a proponent of increasing it indefinitely. I'm not against Lightning or other offloading schemes. I just think there's enough headroom for increase. There's a world class infrastructure ready to go. Yet Bitcoin is targeting smartphones and GPRS connections.
Also I think it's important Bitcoin is able to achieve a successful hardfork. It would have been the right thing at the right time. It would've kept momentum going. Yet it didn't happen. 
Looks like the breakup into BCH and BTC is going to set us back a couple of years. Branding is not to underestimated. Your grandmother has heard of Bitcoin. Yet with the current state newcomers will remain confused. Mining farms will be taken offline. 
I have nearly 20 years experience with web based software development. Worked on complex architectures involving performance, security and offloading solutions. I have brought many challenging projects to successful conclusion.

It appears most people don't understand what a 1000 lightning nodes really means. They compare it with Bitcoin nodes. They think it means there's now millions of people using it.
Just helping people better understand.

Will make it complicated to transfer funds between people don't you think? Every day different rates between the chains. Exchange fees. Exchange transactions causing overhead. Crazy confirmation times. That's not going to work.

Good tech will be successful regardless of what people say about it. 
What I don't understand is why you guys are deceiving your own team. Shilling a 1000 users as if that's equal to a Bitcoin network with 1000 nodes. 
You are supposed to be helping each other!
You shouldn't need me to come here explain how your own tech works.

Totally agree. So that's why you won't find any references to specific browsers on the HTTP protocol spec pages. Like "Download HTTP" with a link to Firefox. 
Bitcoin.org - on the other hand - is very strongly tied to the Bitcoin Core client. The other clients are barely mentioned.

Let's put it on a peer to peer chat
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:16:24
Thank you for explaining. 
I think 1 billion people is a fair goal not raising the bar too much? Satoshi was talking about Visa level all the time. There are 3.1 billion Visa cards (as of Dec 31, 2016). 


Not implying a puppet master. I agree with the organic approach. So I'm expecting the major software projects to have a long-term roadmap (which they can modify at any time) that addresses these kinds of things.
The segwit idea was agreed upon around 2015:
Lightning is currently free from the consensus model. So that's nice. But it is suffering from the same hurdle to reach mainstream adoption. So I'm curious how they plan to overcome them. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:35:31
At the moment there's a 1000 altcoins who are dealing with bitcoins capacity problems. 
There's no such thing as "*the* 2nd layer". There's only "2nd layer opportunities". There's also "1st layer opportunities" for Lightning. These things shouldn't be interdependent. 
Lightning is an interesting experiment. But it comes with a slew of questions and assumptions. It remains a guessing game how well it will work. We will need to see if the experiment succeeds. Yet as long as the blocks remain full we have no way to measure its success. 
Meanwhile we are experiencing a real world capacity problem. And there's real world solutions guaranteed to increase its capacity. Yet the capacity of bitcoin remains unchanged. It's not smart to have the future of bitcoin hanging on an experiment. Better to run that experiment independently.

More nodes per user. Means it's even less users than total active nodes.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:07:04
So in order for it to work you need:
* Lightning app on Bob's phone
* Lightning app on Alice's phone
* Bob's lightning node with public IP address
* Alice's lightning node with public IP address
Then when Bob wants to transfer funds over Lightning. 
* Bob's phone app sends command to Bob's Lightning node
* Bob's Lightning node makes connection to Alice's lightning node
* Alice's lightning node automatically accepts the transaction. Channel balance is updated.
* Alice's mobile phone gets notification of the transaction
Like that?

Correction: This is not the primary FUD that is spouted by anti-bitcoin folks. Most people like Lightning and would love to see it succeed. **Lightning can be easily anchored to any other chain.**
The primary FUD is that Lightning is primarily discussed and promoted here at r/bitcoin. While it should be discussed at r/TheLightningNetwork. And r/bitcoin should be focusing their attention on how to deal with the capacity problems.
But when people express these critical valid concerns here. Those comments get ignored or downvoted.

Can you elaborate? If I open a channel with $100 from me and $0 from the coffee shop. I would imagine there's no way the coffee shop can steal my money? And I could close the channel and claim my funds at any time without permission from the coffee shop?
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:02:14

So let's say Alice and Bob have Lightning wallets running on their mobile phones. They have a channel with funds. They are online in different locations.

Your phone doesn't have a public IP address. Simply install a webserver and try to access it through the internet.
The same goes with your PC sitting behind a router on a LAN. You can't connect to it (unless you specifically forward some ports on your router).

You mean your 456 channels. One for every customer? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:18:09
Interesting. So basically everybody can choose to take the centralized or decentralized approach. 
The decentralized approach (with 456 channels for each customer) would be okay if the coffee shop can open them with 0 BTC from their side on each channel. 
The centralized approach would mean the coffee shop needs to open a big channel with an exchange as well. The channel would need to contain enough BTC to fund the revenue for the day. Or have the exchange continuously add funds to the channel as soon as it nears depletion. With this model we'll get ISP's for Bitcoin. Or BSP's.

I'm not against you. :)
Check the following chart and notice how the dominance changes perfectly correlate with when bitcoin reached its capacity limit: 
To get loop back to the OP's post. There is no FUD against Lightning. But there's people who believe that - if other measures were taken - bitcoin would still be at +80% dominance today. The FUD is against bitcoin not taking *those* measures.
Also notice how my comment is now at 0 votes. I think I'm making some fair points. But it's not what people want to hear. Or what people are trying to spin.

Exactly. I'm trying to estimate how long it could take before we see mainstream adoption. I'm missing some critical things on the roadmap.

Let's say Alice and Bob have Lightning wallets running on their mobile phones. They created a channel with funds. They are online in different locations.

Is it replacing your Satoshi Whitepaper artwork?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:23:09
bitcoin.org at January 31 2009:
*"Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha Release - Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It's completely decentralized with no server or trusted parties."*
So it's *the software* what Satoshi called Bitcoin. The software *is* the system. 
Fast foward bitcoin.org at present day:
What is the name of the software? Who renamed it? Roger Ver?
January 31 2009:
"Bitcoin, a new **electronic cash system** that **uses a peer-to-peer network**"
He clearly calls "the system" Bitcoin. Not "the network". 
23 August 2009:
"Bitcoin is a **free open source** peer-to-peer electronic cash system"
2 July 2011:
"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency."
Present day:
"Bitcoin is an innovative payment network"
Now suddenly it's not the system what we call Bitcoin. It's the network.
The brand is all over the place.
Update: It's funny to see how this gets up- and downvoted all the time. Downvotes for citing bitcoin.org. Is there a better source I'm not aware of? :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:11:58
No you're stuck in the trader mind set. Or you're using it for "illegal" activities. You're not thinking about mainstream adoption. It's people like you who are holding this back. It may work for you. But that's not what Satoshi's intention was. 
For mainstream: It takes two to tango. I can switch to Litecoin. But I need the other parties to switch as well. Or have them support 5000 coins. That's the problem. Compare it with chat apps. I can switch to telegram. But if my buddies are sticking with WhatsApp I'll have a problem. So even though there's thousands of chat apps out there. There will be only 1 or 3 big ones that everybody uses in their region. Cryptocurrencies will end up *exactly* like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:03:41
So that's my question. Will they be created?
Imagine all Lightning transactions being relayed through a couple of centralized servers (like WhatsApp). You can wave goodbye to centralization an privacy.
There needs to be a better answer. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:41:27
Another thing that isn't clear to me. Let's say I open a channel with my local coffee shop. I know I will be buying my coffee there every day for the next month. So I open a lightning channel with $100 worth of BTC.
In all the examples I read that both parties add an equal amount to the channel. 
Does this mean the coffeeshop also needs to add $100 worth of BTC? Or could we create a channel where I'm the only one with BTC on the channel. And the coffee shop only needs to add 0 BTC?
Also. Can I prevent my other connected friends from spending my BTC with the coffee shop? What if Alice pays $100 to Bob through my channel with the coffee shop. It means I'll end up having $100 in my channel with Alice. And $0 on my channel with the coffee shop. Can I then spend the $100 from my channel with Alice to pay for my coffee? And would this also mean that Alice would need to be "online" to confirm the updates to our channel? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:12:19
I disagree. I think people are looking at it from an investor point of view too much. If Bitcoin would have succeeded in doing a hard fork with increased blocksize then:
* Transactions would have been cheap
* There would've been more merchant adoption
* There would've been more consumer adoption
* Price would've reflected the increased value
* Investors would've been happy
* BCH would not have existed
* The Bitcoin community would still be united and strong
* Altcoins would have negligible market share
* Demand for US and European mining pools would've increased
Altcoins are a natural answer to investor demand. But there's no future in that market. The only future is with a global currency. You can't have that with a 1000 altcoins. You can't expect merchants to support them all. You can't explain that to your grandmother.
We will get there. I think it will involve PoW. It's just going to take a while longer. Shake out the crazy investors first.

Segwit also makes the blocks bigger (2MB)
Pick your poison:
*  Making it affordable to run full nodes at home. Means capacity can't meet demand. Less affordable transactions.
* Increase capacity to meet demand. Means transactions are affordable. Means running a full node from home is less affordable. 
Affordable transactions or affordable full nodes?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:14:25
Facebook went from 100 million to 1 billion in around 4 years. But then Facebook growth rate has never been hampered by capacity problems. 
These are all sensible points. Perhaps they should just make them official? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:40:27
You will find that altcoin adoption will be perfectly aligned with how much transaction demand exceeds bitcoins capacity. Until we reach a breaking point.

How could it work without running a Lightning node? They would be using hosted nodes? Or some 3rd party that offers some kind of service to maintain channels?
I can indeed imagine channel updates can be sent through other transport protocols like email, WhatsApp or Telegram.
