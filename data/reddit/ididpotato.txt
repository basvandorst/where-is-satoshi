How does it help any Greek people who would rather go the the ATM and store them money in euro's right now. 
This isn't cyprus 
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:25:25
1. Go to ATM
2. Withdraw euro's
3. problem solved
anyone who has more than a few thousand in the bank in Greece has already moved it long ago

The controversial introduction of mandatory cashpoint charges still requires approval by the European Central Bank but is expected to amount to €1 for every €1,000 transaction.
Not much of a tax in fairness, still cheaper than the friction involved in obtaining bitcoin in Greece


Accounts with over 100K had money missing AFAIK. Deposit insurance covers amounts under 100K in europe.


I agree with this and some of what you are saying but I think you are going over the top, I would say over 95% of people in Greece only have a months salary at most in their bank accounts and that can be withdrawn in euros pretty easily right now, the oligarchical classes will already have their money in interest bearing assets and it won't be in a bank account in the first place.
THe only possible and realistic use case I can see for bitcoin is if and when the new currency is launched and inflation becomes a problem, perhaps some tech savvy people will rather hold money through bitcoin but still it will be a minority of a tech savvy sector of the population and I say this as a European who has one bitcoin

anyone with over 100k in their bank account during the age of ZIRP is doing it wrong. 
no amount of advice will help them although I fail to see who would be that stupid

if you followed the news about Greece in the past weeks it's only been about institutional money leaving, people are only keeping cash on hand at this point.

Sorry to hijack the top comment but if people here really want to make tipping Tuesday a thing there is no better place to show the power of bitcoin (and the uselessness of baning it) than by tipping Ukrainians over in and @_date: 2014-09-26 17:05:57
Go fund yourselves!!

wow you really are just an ignorant nasty person aren't you?
want to generalize any other entire nations while you are at it.
No matter how poor you are everyone tries to make some savings to improve their lives, especially in countries where easy access to credit is not taken for granted 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:42:59
not really if you believe this Ukrainian who sums up the rules there regarding other currencies

There are paper contracts for bitcoin too on okcoin afaik, (not sure how they are hedged behind the scenes though)
I don't follow that closely either, 


I'm just pointing out possible reasons to manipulate the market.
Put simply if you want to bring a competitor into the ctypto space in the next year or two making sure bitcoin stays away from mainstream would be a big priority.
With a market cap of only 5 billion (and probably only about 2.5billion of that usable or not lost) it's play-money for entity's with a motive. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:47:51


yes and obvious manipulation scares them away which I'm starting to consider.


I can lodge USD to any exchange and short/long the market with it with leverage.
it's pretty much accepted gold and silver was manipulated by naked shorting so why not BTC?

Exactly, this article is a few months old.
They seemed to have better infrastructure than many western European states to begin with though, 
It just surprised me it was such a big thing there to begin with

You are forgetting the crazy devaluation of their national currency, monetary controls and how it's not to *spend* but to store their wealth.
I'm sure a troll like you doesn't have any idea how hard it is to acquire foreign currency in less developed states but carry on being a useless idiot and troll away.

I say the exact opposite, now instead of fighting for increased hashpower we are entering the stage where the miners right for increased efficiency while all the time having to battle closer and closer breakeven margins, meaning no opportunity to hold coins, and a higher percentage of mined coins liquidated to cover electricity and cooling costs denominated in FIAT 
@_date: 2014-12-03 11:33:57
the oposite is true in fact.
no increase in difficulty means now the miner battle becomes an efficiency one. 
only the most efficient operations can turn profit and that means running at barely break-even margins.
Since electricity and cooling as priced in fiat, mined coins must be at a higher rate to cover expenditure.

Hardly, but if bearwhale is flattered I'd appreciate any insider information on when they plan to quit dumping.
