Damn... roasted.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:49:51
Does this really work? What happens if you send to an address that does not exist?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:54:17
bitcoin cash is faster and more secure... have you looked into the tech?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:24
it will be at 8k by then still tumbling down and eveyone will be vomiting over their loss
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:13:14
No wait for it drop. Now is not the time to go all in.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:37:05
you learned a lesson. NEVER USE COINBASE.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:51:54
isnt this from a few months ago???
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:04
These dumps have me weary of the future of bitcoin and VC in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:27:38
Check it once in awhile and make sure it’s not tanking to 0 lol besides that I let it sit like a seed just planted 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:19:31
Fuck yea
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:32:09
lol its 3k.. its not . aa bubble. its about the avarage market price. Its better tech,i can see it gonng to 4k this week
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:54:37
Good luck brother! Get ready for a roller coaster. It’s going to drop big many times. Don’t be scared... think 15 years from now. Don’t think about that drop today.  And when it does drop. Buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:37:58
I ask the same questions. Money goes quick.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:50:30
Haha made me laugh. Thanks. &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:59
dude its going to be 7k by morning
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:19:30
No sorry. This is why people don’t suggest you use Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:16:21
If it dips 2k, sticks there, starts to move, go all in. No on knows though.. it can just keep going up or it can just drop hard. That’s why people are calling it a gamble. What happens NOW is not my concern. What happens in 10 or so years is. I don’t care if it drops to 5k tomorrow. I believe it will be dominant in the years to come.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:30:05
!RemindMe 5 years
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:39:25
why not just keep paying the interest... I already made 25k...
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:51:21
I just put 100k in cash to bc..im going to let it sit for 10 to 15 years. wish me luck. please babies born in the year 2000, adopt to vitural currency!! I decided its worth the wait. Keep cashing out guys.. ill keep buying more.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:36:21
Im with you, I calculated the time it would take to make the money back and my possible return. It was actually quite fair. Not huge. Just fair.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:33:47
Im not scared. I firmly believe it will be accepted throughout the world and America before i'm 40. Some people pay more in child support than I do on the loan. Thats how I think of it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:22
it could..
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:05:48
its 16.3 right now... ouch
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:45:13
No, I would have called you crazy lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:26:45
why do you say that???
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:27:08
I develop and maintain a website for a large company in Cleveland OH. I work with Java and c asp.net). This also includes, sql, html, js, etc. Full stack goodies.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:35:27
You’re better off holding anyway. Panic sell is how you lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:21:20
My father cosigned or I would not have gotten it, even though I can clearly afford it. Im not comfortable talking about the loan yet on here but it was very fair. I dont have many assets, it took a lot of convincing. It was done at their branch headquarters and I met with the banks manager... the big dude. I convinced him. He gave me a credit line of 100k and I used every penny. I dont worry about. I just pay the loan and go on with my life. I hardly check the price of bc. I dont care right now. I let it sit, live my life, and just hope I make out in 10-15 years
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:47:04
Looks like you will be double my net worth. Best of luck my friend!! Also. I don’t sleep.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:38:19
Can’t go that crazy now... ha. It’s crazy though and cost me a lot of money to do this... not for the normals. We are crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:40:48
use gemini wire transfer for same day and no limit...
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:38:23
so true though lmao
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:44:29
well, im up 25k..  as soon as im up 100k.. maybe? idk. Not worried about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:30:29
!RemindMe 10 years
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:29
you should... bit coin cash is cheaper and people will buy more fo that killing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:05:29
Paying it off with income. I have to figure the math on that, which I have not yet as the monthly payment isn’t killing me by any means 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:33:17
call them or email them... they can look into it and see if it got stuck in a queue
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:12:21
software engineer, I make 80k a year, i was approved for the loan, sold my sports car and only pay interest on the loan. Hell I dont know whats going to happen. Its a MAJOR and stupid risk and thats how millionaires are born. Also have 10k left to build out a room for mining machines... Ill either be broke in 10 - 15 years or rich as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:09:12
Huntington headquarters in Cleveland Ohio, they only offered me 30k, I then spoke to the manager and convinced him to give me 100 after an hour of discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:29
I’m not a pig... I just believe in technology. Just like Steve jobs did when he realized computers would replace thousands of office workers working with paper.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:10:47
Lmao I legit just busted out laughing at my office. But yes I can work from home some days if I choose, ha
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:55:59
Also 60k is still enough to make you a millionaire if it takes off and becomes a full blown tender in America. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:02:58
Its does not work like that... They panic because they bought when it was 12, 13 or 14k.... Hence the panic...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:20
bought 30k worth at 3k and sold at 4. Never looked back, 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:36:43
not at all man..
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:12:34
Yes, I am up quite a bit... I took a risk... Im young and dont have 100k laying around. I pay off the interest every month.. thats it. I can afford it and im having a blast. Thats all that matters. Lets wait 10 - 15 years when VC really takes off. People call me stupid everyday man, saying why didnt you just buy a bigger home... I told them I bought (traded into) a currency, not a stock. People still dont understand. I could cash out out now... and bank that... I wont. Even if i reach 5 mil, i wont cash it out. Im holding it. for a LOOONG time. I think way ahead. not in the now. In the future. I go to work and forget about it. I check once a week. Its just there for me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:21
mine is aswell... wtf is going on
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:14:14
Thank you :) I believe In the tech as well. It’s not pureee gambling since we have a little insight, but yeah it’s gambling lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:04:24
nov, around 9k :( I wanted to last year but did not have the funds. I still think it will pay off very well. Thank you man! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:54:42
Fuck yeah.  It’s a risk... 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:06:46
I develop software... and I’m pretty damn good. So... it’s possible. I actually could try. I may in my free time.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:19:41
haha, ill look back and let you know.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:52:43
I know.. I can’t wait to see his face. This is exactly what they tell us not to do.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:21:18
Don’t panic sell... it’s how you lose money. Hold. It wi come back up in the following weeks
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:50:06
I don’t mind making the payment... like I said. It’s a seed that I planted. I hope it grows. It’s gambling really. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:33
DO I CASH OUT SOME? Im confused, and was not ready for this and I am not experienced.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:14:17
No. If you like. Use it. I personally dont like being taken for.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:36:26
lol, 2040 they will be poor. Bitcoin will have long been replaced and VC regulated. lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:10
no... dont bcc will win... its better tech
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:06:58
huh where??
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:31:04
BCH has better tech than btc... its the truth. Honestly... it could take down bitcoin, no one knows yet. I wouldnt stay in bit coin too long, it will be at 9k before you know it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:20
by not investing in it?
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:48:02
That’s spot on,
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:20:39
Give it time, its only been one day. Well see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:29:45
dont we all wish. And i bought in nov... so not long ago. it will be a roller coaster and drop for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:13:35

@_date: 2017-12-03 03:09:29
I own 9.4 bitcoin, I challenge reddit to steal this from me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:58:27
Because I don’t want to work when I’m 35. I’d rather have money work for me...
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:59:51
That makes me a pig? 15 years is quick? I believe in something. I’ll only live once. Im young, smart and stupid. I can’t wait much longer to take risk. This was my time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:02:25
No, Im sorry, I use Binance and BitCoin Cash is BCC on their site.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:37:12
well... he couldnt have been more wrong. lmao
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:23:23
It’s going to dip even more in the coming days
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:51:51
Thank you ha. Since you wished me luck. Come back here in 10 years and if I’m rich af I’ll send you 10k for the hell of it. Hopefully I’ll be able to do so payshop.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:22:06
lmao, well you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:06
I dont feel comfortable talking about my loan yet, but it was fair, not too high, but not the lowest either. Also, aslong as people dont do what I did, ill be fine. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:23:18
You will find out soon.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:01:21
if your'e only trying to make 50 to 100 bucks just stay out of bitcoin and go to work, its not for you. You will be burned. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:29:22
You try ever last effort to save what you can. It’s all you can do. It’s high risk....
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:22:08
and yes, I have a plan for a decline.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:24:23
Thank you for the advice. I have an appointment with a financial adviser soon to figure that all out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:39
HOLY SHIT I MADE SO MUCH MONEY THIS WEEK. WOW, did not expect this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:06
Yes, but it will be cleared up soon, but they wont remove it from their platform.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:14:07
Thanks man :) I do my best and hopefully dont fall into the debt trap the bank wants me to.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:25:58
Not like you need to use it. Gemini is nice... there are a few others not aswell. Some you can even buy using proxies out of the US. There are ways to stay anonymous, if you truly desire.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:47:18
4 bitcoin in bitmart, and I am also unable to withdraw. I checked yesterday and my account is at 0 without a trace... I cant get ahold of support and my money was stolen. I like to try new exchanges and this is the first time I had money stolen since nano. This won't kill me, but it is upsetting, and I will no longer be experimenting with other echanges with that amount of money. I'm not kidding my account dropped to 0 without a withdraw. They legit jacked it and deleted records. It's not even funny.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:48:30
OP is going to end up broke af.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:47:20
Not FUD man. The tech is not THERE. FUD for your money maybe. I would suggest you invest in more advanced technologies, or you wouldn't have to say that.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:48:52
lattice chains and personal ledgers will not allow bitcoin to grow.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:49:14
Bitcoin might not but your money is. LMAO
