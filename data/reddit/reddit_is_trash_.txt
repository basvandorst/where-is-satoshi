Whoosh lol  
I hope someday you figure out why comparing a single asset to an entire market is stupid.  I have a feeling you won't though, because *you're* stupid.   :(  Oh well who cares, you're a waste of my time, bye  /ignored
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:35:36
ALL Bitcoin users *were* affected.  Maybe they didn't all take a 34% haircut, and maybe it'll recover... but the price of a single bitcoin took a huge hit; EVERY bitcoin user on earth WAS affected.  
EDIT: Downvote all you want kids, facts are facts.   EVERY bitcoin on earth lost value, including the "safe" ones in your wallet.

LOL nice try.  Take a look at the [sold listings]( -- you won't find anything that's gone for anywhere near that price, ever (because they aren't "worth" anywhere near that).  Those $500k listings you see are bagholders like yourself, desperately hoping for a greater fool to  come around &amp; save them from their shitty long term "investments".  Look for yourself -- there aren't enough greater fools to go around.    I'm sure those poor dumbasses are all telling themselves the same thing: "I haven't sold so I haven't lost!"  Meanwhile they're desperately trying to sell to recoup their losses LMAO

You SOLD five days ago, but you were somehow unaffected by the dip that happened six day ago, right?   Okay bud, keep telling yourself that.   Why are bitcoiners so blatantly dishonest, even with themselves? 


No, you sure don't -- you don't hodl AT ALL -- you sodl instead, probably for a loss LOL
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:55:48
I'm here now, let's talk today.   
"Nope"???   Is that disagreement or denial?     
So...  do you believe your bitcoins will buy the same amount today as they did yesterday?   Please explain.     
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:17:10
It doesn't matter if your funds were under your own control or someone else's -- they lost 25% of their value regardless.   Bitcoiners claim that it has no third party risk which is false - it has multiple-third-parties risk, as you're all finding out AGAIN now.  Cryptocurrencies in general are a mine-field of risk.   People who had nothing to do with Bitfinex are currently affected by this - just like people who had nothing to do with the DAO or fork were affected, and people who had nothing to do with mtgox were affected...    it doesn't matter where you keep your coins, their value is subject to outside forces that, as we've seen many times, can be in malevolent or incompetent hands. 
I don't shrug off 25% losses but that's just me.   I guess that's better than 100% loss or worse, getting margin called.
If you were holding a down-payment for a new house that you're hoping to buy this month in bitcoin, I'm quite sure "meh" wouldn't be your reaction.   
You should be able to do that with a currency, you know?   Hold a downpayment (or a regular payment, for that matter) for a house in said currency, without losing so much value that you can't afford the  house anymore.

When read sarcastically it sounds even stupider.   I can list several individual indexes on the S&amp;P that outperformed bitcoin in 2015 and so far in 2016.   How are you going to compare a single asset to an whole market with a straight face?   There are penny stocks that performed better than "cryptocurrency" too, that doesn't mean you should load up on penny stocks either.  
@_date: 2016-08-25 21:43:01
Yes, he does compare private blockchains to LANs... but he also says that any company using a LAN instead of the open, public internet for their proprietary business purposes is doing it wrong.  He basically says that LANs/Intranets aren't nearly as useful (depends on the use case IMO) and even borderline unethical (because hey if it's not open &amp; public you must have something to hide).  That's asinine.

I like how you added the "and that has the same value as silver has now" part.  That makes your question a stupid one.   Your real question is: "What can you do with silver if nobody else in the world wants it?". And actually that's a pretty stupid question too.  The answer is: "lots of things".

OP just shat on Andreas's face with this post, I love it.   I'd love to see him come here &amp; ask a few questions - he makes a lot of arguments against private blockchains with what I believe to be bullshit premises and strawmen - I can tell from OP's post and his responses to questions here that he is knowledgeable and eloquent enough to put all of Andreas's very strong skepticisms and criticisms to rest.

OK, well obviously "it hasn't happened yet" isn't the same thing as "it can't/won't ever happen".

For bills, yes that's true.   For coins it's not...  coins used to be made out of silver.   The're worth ~20x times their face value (new or old) - a silver dime is worth $2, a silver quarter is worth $5, A silver dollar is worth $20+.  Money with real intrinsic value has done well against inflation.  The way I define intrinsic value is: if nobody else in the world wants it, can I do something useful with it? (with bitcoin the answer is NO)
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:31:19

Well, I can't argue with that.   demonstrates that point every single day.

Nobody said anything about the future, stupid.   I said there are people who've been holding beanie babies for 20+ years claiming "I haven't sold so I haven't lost" which perfectly demonstrates why your mantra is bullshit.

"Backed by" doesn't necessarily mean "currency backing".  "Backed by a private company" could very well mean "supported by" or "endorsed by".  And by that definition, bitcoin *is* backed by *lots* of private companies.   
So, yes.  
Again, he didn't elaborate and your wife didn't ask him to explain, so... you're making assumptions about what he actually meant.  His statement has never come across as categorically false or ignorant to me - in fact I immediately thought of several private companies  supporting, endorsing or... wait for it... "backing" bitcoin - financially, philosophically, politically, legally, etc.    
Context is important, but you didn't have any.  You just jumped to conclusions instead.  
@_date: 2016-08-28 20:15:36


@_date: 2016-08-02 22:24:46
The point of my reply was to demonstrate that your mantra: "You haven't lost anything unless you sell!" is bullshit.  That "argument" doesn't hinge on anything - it's a fact.  It's good that you're not committed to the other side of that argument because you have absolutely no chance of disproving it.

First of all, depending on what he meant by "backed", he's not completely wrong so "displaying clear ignorance" is false, but it's the angle you choose to take on it anyway.  Second, a single unrebutted sentence, with no elaboration and no further conversation can hardly be called "pontificating with certainty".   I mean, this was a third-person account right?   It almost sounds like he told *you* more than he told your wife.

It's true.   The question of intrinsic value is really this:   If nobody else on earth wants it, what can you do with it?   With gold, I can make a spoon or fill a cavity.   With a piece of wood, I can burn it or build something with it.   With food or water, I can consume it.   With paper money, I can burn it or make paper airplanes out of it.    With bitcoins...     what can you do with it?   If nobody else on the planet wants your bitcoins, what value do they truly have?   Almost everything has *some* kind of value even if nobody else wants it - hell even with a rock, I can throw it.   But what can you do with a bitcoin if nobody else wants it?    If you can answer that, you'll convince me that bitcoin has intrinsic value.

How do you figure that???   If $20 bought a suit in 1913, that means that an ounce of gold bought a suit too (because gold was about $20/ounce back then).    That same ounce of gold will still buy a nice suit today, but the $20 will not.   That's the *opposite* of keeping pace with eachother.

Your argument has nothing to do with my point - but to argue that bitcoin is no different than gold is absurd.   They're very different.

The vast majority of bitcoin owners have no actual use for it, just like you.   It's a bunch of gamblers hoarding their own coins but fully expecting everybody else to circulate theirs.   There is no incentive to actually use it - casino chips aren't for daily use - they're for gambling - and so are bitcoins.

LOL nice try but FAIL.   There was only one single prosecution/confiscation in those 40 years.  If you know your history, you know that a large portion of the population simply turned in a small fraction of their gold and then buried the rest in their back yard &amp; reaped the benefits of the revaluation.  Where do you think the phrase "If you don't hold it, you don't own it" came from?   You don't think bitcoiners came up with that, do you? LOL   That's the nice thing about gold - it can be held in ways that make physical possession inalienable by government decree.   Bitcoin still loses, bigtime.  I won't bother to list all the bitcoin losses I find here -- I think there's  10,000 character limit on comments - there's nowhere near enough room to list them all.

Peter Schiff is right.   There's nothing special about bitcoin.   If you can make one cryptocurrency/blockchain you can make a million of them.   Setting a value in software that can be re-implemented over &amp; over again is not how scarcity works.  Private blockchain implementations are popping up everywhere, and now "THE" blockchchain could turn into two blockchains.  Your 21 million bitcoins would become 42 million.   Not to mention all the other cryptocurrencies which, for all intents and purposes, do the exact same thing as bitcoin.     You guys are proving Peter Schiff right.

Those exports are mostly illicit substances.    And cheaper goods don't automatically translate into a better quality of life for all --  local  businesses in Mexico were decimated by the influx of cheap goods, and farmers by subsidies - which made the only jobs available the slave-wage paying manufacturing jobs in plants that American companies built right across the border in Mexico.  Have you ever been to Mexico?   Does it look like a place where the wealth of the nation is distributed fairly?   I don't think it does.   I think it looks like a place where the people are being oppressed and exploited.   


Are you telling me that America does agriculture better than Mexico?    Mexico is some of the most fertile land in the world, and populated with some of the most capable people to work it.   Meanwhile, *American* agriculture is powered by "illegal" labor, grown in deserts here in America.  It would literally collapse without illegal Mexican workers.  If what you're saying is correct, then wouldn't it make sense for America to buy it's produce from Mexico instead of the other way around?  Same goes for manufacturing -- do you really believe that Mexico does manufacturing better than America does, and that's why American plants are built there?

Thinking about gold as a store of value doesn't have anything to do with using it as an everyday currency.  Bitcoiners like to make that comparison and say, "see?  bitcoin wins because it's easily transferrable and gold isn't" but that's conflating two different things.      Gold doesn't have to be easily stored or transferred to serve as a good store of value, that's not the point.    


You do know that the mantra bitcoiners like throw around so much, "If you don't hold it you don't own it" is a goldbug thing, right?    There's no counterparty risk when you hold physical gold.   
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:52:01
His point is bullshit anyway.   These people think that calling bitcoin gold 2.0 makes it gold 2.0.   It doesn't.   Bitcoin doesn't do what gold does, it never has and it never will.

I know for damn sure that my multi-billion dollar company's intranet is no "stagnant island of information" as Andreas calls it.  It's a private, proprietary interface to the entire company and its personnel, tools, information, resources, policies, processes, etc.   If Andreas can't see the value in that he's lying to himself.   That's the only possibility - he's lying to himself.  And he's lying to you too, with a straight face.    
If private blockchains are equivalent to local area networks, then private blockchains have a very bright future contrary to what Andreas tries to tell you in this video.   Everybody's taking a victory lap over Goldman exiting R3CEV but it seems like nobody here noticed the fact that they're still working on a *private* blockchain.

No we weren't.  
How does the saying go?  You can't see the for forest for the trees.   Yeah, that's it.   Like I said, you're on another subject - I'm definitely NOT arguing over whether it's easier to confiscate gold or bitcoin.    Nor am I arguing whether  it's easier to transport.   I'm explaining why those things don't matter in the context of it being a  store value.   Treasury bonds are easy to confiscate and difficult to transport - that doesn't make them a bad store of value.   You're the one getting angry - I'm simply making points.   I'm a straight shooter - if your feelings get hurt because you can't win an argument with me, well, who cares.

It IS important.   It gets at the crux of your argument.   Merchants don't want your bitcoin, they want their local currency - in order to purchase anything, you have to convert your bitcoin to that currency (i.e. sell).  Today the price is $900, if tomorrow the price is $300 - that $600 difference will be gone to you because those gains were never realized - they were theoretical.   You should have sold (or spent) today if you wanted to actualize those gains.

Well that took long enough.   
But as long as you hold your own private keys, you're "safe", right? 
Those aren't "grievances" by the way, they're legitimate concerns regarding bitcoin's ability to store value.  It sucks that you can't ever raise a valid skeptical point about bitcoin without somebody derailing the conversation with vitriol and stupidity.   
What was all that "buying at the top of a bubble is dumb, clearly you did or you wouldn't be so salty" crap when you have no idea when I bought?  I'm not salty because I bought $100 worth when the price was $80.  That's the only purchase I've ever made.  Woopdie doo.    Seems to me you're the one who has grievances with me stating my position, you're salty because you know I'm right.    If you hold your own private keys, your ownership of the coins might be safe - but no matter where your private keys are, your coins are in danger of becoming extremely illiquid AND losing value at the same time.  It's happened frequently enough in the crypto markets that I for one would not want to be holding any real value in any of them.    Thanks for finally acknowledging my point.   Now if you'd like to provide a rebuttal, I'm all ears.

I think you have a valid point.   I've been more or less watching bitcoin from the sidelines for the last several years.   A lot of people say I've missed out.   What they usually mean is that I've missed out on the investment - not a better experience with money.   
I have other investments that, as far as capital appreciation goes, kick bitcoin's ass.  I do not consider those things long term stores of value, they're relatively risky investments.  Bitcoin would fit into my portfolio like a penny stock.   I would use it exactly as you describe, OP.  Bitcoins, for me, would be like casino chips on a craps table - I have no use for them in real life, I'd only buy them to gamble with.

Then how the fuck are you going to claim a larger market cap than bitcoin?  Here's the answer: you can't claim that, retard, because that's not how it works.  You're basically arguing against yourself.   I /ignored your ass at work, I'm /ignoring your ass on my home PC too.   You're an ignorant 9th grader and you've got a lot to learn kid.   Good luck, see ya. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 03:28:48
Ok then, let's do this.   You make a cryptocurrency and issue 10 billion shares.   I'll be the guy to buy one, for $10.   We'll then have a market cap of $100 billion, and since you're the guy who created the currency, you'll basically have $100 billion in your hands.   All you have to do is sell your coinjaf tokens!!     This is going to be awesome, you're a genius.   LET'S DO THIS BRO


Uh, nothing.   


No it doesn't, stupid.  Do you know what volume is?   Rhetorical question, you obviously don't. 
I think it's cute how you think a trading volume of one share ever sets the price.   If you have volume to support a price, then that's the price.   If you don't have the volume, then you're just a dumbass who paid too much for a share of shit.   Like I said, I'll be your sucker - you make the currency, I'll be the idiot who pays $10 for a share, and you'll be set for life with your other 9,999,999,999 shares, each worth what I paid - $10.   Or I don't know, maybe your shitcoins will find their *true* price *and* their true market cap of "jack shit" on zero volume because, uh, that's how it works.  It's simple supply and demand bro.   If you have a supply of 10 billion shares and your demand is *one* share at $10, the price is NOT magically $10 per share and market cap is most certainly not $100 billion.   
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:16:53
You're absolutely right, the definition is "Price x number".  Now all you have to do is figure out how to determine price and you've got it!!
Hint: selling one share to your buddy for $10 doesn't magically make the price $10 per share.  I've said this to you many times but you're just too dumb to get it.  I don't know what else to do for you bud.  You're stuck on ignorant.  Oh well lol!

@_date: 2016-09-01 20:43:14
I don't need miners to confirm my possession of gold.   Bitcoins don't even exist -- only records of transactions do -- so no, hodling private keys is NOT like holding physical gold.  It's much more akin to holding gold certificates.

You guys are stupid.  That's not at all how market cap works.
@_date: 2016-09-22 17:28:43
You said this: 


was "exactly right" LOL
You need to learn how price is calculated.   Selling one share to your buddy for $10 doesn't magically make the price $10 per share, dumbass.   You have no demand at that price.... so that's not the price.   Get it??? (Another rhetorical question, I know you don't)
Volume doesn't have anything to do with market cap???? LOL you're an idiot.  Econ 101: take it bro.  If you have no volume, then you have no price, and you have no market cap.   It's all very simple, but it's way over your head I guess.   I hate it when I engage in internet debates only to realize waay too late that I'm talking to a 9th grader.  Damnit.  
FYI, he's not "exactly right", he's exactly WRONG and so are you.   You're both stupid.     Bye now! :) /ignored.

Nobody holds gold &amp; silver with the intention of using them as everyday currencies.  Saying otherwise is a fallacy.  Gold &amp; silver are hedges to protect your wealth against uncertainty and turmoil - not something you pay your rent &amp; buy groceries with.   The stocks in your 401k or the rental property you own aren't good currencies either -- that's not what they're for.  


FYI -- By definition, if a currency is backed by gold it's NOT fiat.

The value proposition to whom??? The currency itself??  Who cares.  There's value in anything you do that solves problems or creates efficiencies - you can make assumptions about what's valuable to a company like accenture, but the truth is you don't know shit about any of their processes or systems, so you can't possibly know what's valuable to them.  So many of you naysayers are shitting on these experiments like you have the first clue what the objective even is. You obviously don't; to declare it worthless without even knowing what it is just makes you look ignorant and afraid.

Yes it is.  He used the nice round number of $1300 instead of the *real* price, which was $1334, and he literally said "that's *about* half a percent".  
$6 / $1300 = .00461538 (or "about half a percent", his ballparked number) 
$6 / $1334 = .00449775 (the actual number)
$5 / $1334 -- .00374812 (my ballparked number)
So the rounding/ballparking of numbers made a difference - and again, I didn't carry the decimal far enough.   Sorry again for the egregious mistake.  Leave it to the pedants of to get stuck on THAT instead of getting my actual point, which is that pointing out a ~$5 move on ~$1300 price as a reason not to buy is fucking stupid.

You'll have to ask each &amp; every one of these project leaders who *are* putting up with those deficiencies why that is.   There are obviously reasons, you just don't know them.  That's the nature of proprietary software -- I'm building a project to send software updates to set-top-boxes, via satellite, from a web page.   There's unbelievable complexity and not all things are optimally efficient.   That's how it goes.   We use technologies, protocols and systems that are dreadfully inefficient in many ways - but there are other aspects that are indispensable - we can't do without the mechanism it provides.  We use technologies in ways they were never intended all the time.   That's the way it works.   
You can't say the one feature YOU find most valuable is the only feature that anybody else can or should ever find valuable.   Take a look around.  That's obviously not the case.   People are finding value in other aspects as well, not just immutability.  How could you possibly know if immutability is even a requirement for a company's private, internal process anyway?  You can't.

Andreas tried to make a few of those sketchy  analogies that don't really work but Joe called him out on it.  He noticeably tones it down in this interview, IMO.   He floated a few of his usual empty platitudes but Joe didn't really bite.   I actually gained some respect for Andreas because this is really the first time I've seen him field any kind of counter-point whatsoever.  Joe's a pretty bright guy, he asked some good questions and made some good points, he keyed in on the right things for the most part.  I feel like Andreas toe'd the line with his answers, he's usually pretty heavy with the rhetoric and mumbo-jumbo.   Joe's too smart for that shit and Andreas knows it.   I hate to admit it but Andreas seems more level-headed and thoughtful than I thought he was.

Actually, no.   People defaulting on loans they couldn't afford is what caused the crisis.

You could have had your coins buried 100 feet deep in Siberia when Bitfinex, MtGox, etc happened -- still, they lost value when the market tanked because of those exchange issues.  
So by all means, keep your coins in your own wallet -- it won't protect them from market turmoil when yet another exchange bites the dust.  Everybody on earth who owned a bitcoin, whether they held their own private keys or not, lost value after Bitfinex and MtGox.

Vieira suggests moving back to a gold standard, but that's not the same thing as using physical gold as a currency.  He's not arguing that physical gold is a better currency than dollars - he's arguing that fractional reserve banking and fiat currencies are forms of theft.  He may be advocating using gold as a currency, but not physical gold - gold-backed paper money (i.e. the gold-standard dollar) DO work as everyday currencies, but without the pitfalls of theft by devaluation and of having to carry heavy chunks of metal around.

Well, what I said applies to pretty much all people - can you name a place on earth where gold IS used as an everyday currency?   I didn't think so.   That doesn't change the fact that ALL people who own gold use it every single day -- to, at the very least, store wealth. 


Maybe so, but what does that have to do with gold?   Again, my point is that "the goal of gold" isn't to be a currency, so you're right - to compare bitcoin to gold is stupid - they're different things with different purposes.  Gold isn't a daily/weekly/monthly currency, just like houses and 401ks aren't daily/weekly/monthly currency.

The law is a response to the subprime lending debacle that led up up to the 2008 financial crisis, when banks were allowing stated income loans with unverified funds -- when I bought my first house, I simply stated that I made a much bigger salary than I really made and they took my word for it.  I actually deposited a big fat chunk of the seller's money into my bank account, printed a bank statement &amp; gave it to my lender to "verify funds", and then withdrew the money and gave it back to the seller.  It's not like that anymore - funds and income are verified thoroughly these days.   


No you wouldn't because everwhere you go would do the exact same thing.   If you expect someone to write a check on your behalf for a quarter million dollars or more, they have a right to know if you can afford to pay them back.   If you don't want to deal with regulations like this, bring cash to the table.

It doesn't matter if you're a speculator or a businessman or a casual hobbyist - every single bitcoin holder on earth lost value after those exchanges took a shit.

Nobody believed the Fed when they hinted at a rate hike 6 months ago.  (And that's all it ever was, a hint, not a declaration or a promise.  You say, "The US FED has been saying for 6 months that there will be rate rises this year.", but that's a false premise, no they haven't.  They've been precariously hinting at best.)   The Fed changes their tune with the wind and investors know it.  Markets move drastically on FOMC meeting minutes, ffs.   Anybody who priced in a rate hike 6 months ago based on some obscure hint dropped by Janet Yellen is a fool.    The halving isn't a rumor that may or may not happen depending on certain indicators -- it's absolutely IS going to happen, and we know how &amp; when.  It's been priced in for a long time.

It's obviously not a warning to "the enemy", it's denial and frustration that nobody who matters believes the "private blockchains are worthless" narrative.  You can keep saying that but they're being developed nonetheless.  If people truly believed private blockchains weren't viable they'd do exactly as you said and just shut up, grab some popcorn and watch the fireworks.  Instead, people are repeating the mantra hoping people buy it before it's proven otherwise (it's just about too late at this point, the cat's out of the bag folks).

Instead of being a LAZY asshole, how about getting off your ass and looking that readily available information up all by yourself?  It's not like it's hard to find -- you can learn all about it on this new thing called "the internet".  You should check it out.

Welcome to the future.  
I had a similar experience, but with actual money - I handed the guy a $10 bill, he handed me a plate of food and I ate it.  It was amazing.

"A lot of us believe this will be a reality eventually"
But you have no idea about the math behind this belief?
LOL   
A lot of us believe that humans will eventually turn into 30-foot giants who can fly.   Can someone here please explain to me how humans become 30-foot giants that fly?

Like I said, the information is readily available, you don't have to get mad at people for not giving it to you.  Unless you're just too stupid to find it yourself, in which case... don't worry, I'll throw you a bone.  Here you go: 
Google really isn't that hard bro.  I tutor stupid kids like you all the time - feel free to PM me if you need some help.

You can use drugs to launder money but drugs aren't money either are they.

If I was there I'd have taken that "I'll grab your phone and throw it out the window" remark as an irresistible dare.  
If you don't like me using my phone, feel free to say whatever you want -- put your hands on me or my property and I'll break your fucking toughguy neck. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:38:44


Of course you will.  That's what lazy assholes do.
 
Once you figure out how to Google, you'll be able to look information up all by your big boy self instead of calling people assholes for not spoon-feeding it to you like the lazy asshole you are.

The first things that comes to mind for me are the Satoshi coins.  If they ever move the whole world will notice and it will mean something (I don't know what) to a lot of people, and the whole bitcoin market as well.   
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:50:41
If you don't mind making absolutely nothing, ever, then I say go for it!

You're mostly correct, but the sequins tell us that he was bluffing to begin with. 
You can fantasize about me however you like - nunchuck totin' pitbull, scrawny geek, whatever.  Just keep your hands off me and my shit and we won't have a problem. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:09:18
Yep.  Because this is the internet - where everybody's an internet tough guy according to the guy who always points out how comical a thing it is to say.
