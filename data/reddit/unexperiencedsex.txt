I actually spent 10k on bitcoin in the last two month... always been hopeful of bitcoin, I am crapping my pants right now... I really don't know what my next move should be... busy wonder, trying to learn about the different coin and technologies, doing trading,  just though it was so awesome, I had to have two.... idk what the next step is for me.... blast me or say something.... I watched my fried make a deposit, into his bank account, saw the meme, and I actually did it... can't sleep, worst part is that none of my friends or family were into the idea really, I tried to convince them give it a whirl even, sending them some bitcoin if they downloaded bread wallet... I feel completely delusional right now...

I also wanted to add thanks for cheering me up, I feel a helluva lot better and will sleep much easier tonight, except for my ether being on the exchange.

I won't, I have two open orders on gemini, with hour glasses next to them and only 5000 satoshi on my phone, might have totally fucked up. like totally. some of my stuff is stuck on binance to, I got some of it of tho... definitely underestimated the power of the dip.
