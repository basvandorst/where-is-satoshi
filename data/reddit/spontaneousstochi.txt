"What it really is," that's a broad question. If you're looking for help I would suggest going into more detail about what you mean there. For example, "Is it PayPal," "Is it decentralized," "What do its more technical components look like," etc.; these could all be very different topics.

What would that be closer to? (A rough estimate in your opinion)

Hello again everybody! I'm looking to continue getting as large of a sample as possible, given my time frame, for Bitcoin users' motivation.  This is a continuing investigation for my master's thesis in sociology,  both looking at Bitcoin as individual users and the community(ies) as a  whole. If you got 5 mins to spare I would really, really appreciate you  filling out my survey as truthfully as possible. Thanks again! You guys are awesome!
