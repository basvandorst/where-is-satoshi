Nah.  They printed the whole receipt.  It's just full of irrelevant information -- date, receipt number, the phone number I typed in.  Pathetically, the printing isn't aligned so the first letter of each row is cut off.  Thankfully, the activation code appears in the middle of the paper.

I hired a secretary just a few days ago to help me promote four ideas:  1. bitcoin 2. competing currencies in general 3. local autonomy 4. the right to self-defense
Bitcoin is my lead because that's where I have specific knowledge.  That's where I'm an expert - [for example](
I've never had a secretary before.  So far, I've had her manage the printing of leaflets.
I wouldn't mind having someone cover her modest salary and my printing costs, but let me show some results first.

There are a number of points being made.  IMO, the fact that the attack is avoidable addresses at least one of them:  That this attack doesn't break bitcoin.

Thanks everyone.  I didn't realize there was a separate site for the activation code.  They should really put it on the receipt.  Ugh.  Typical Ukrainian customer service.  I called the bank expecting they'd tell me this, but the lady insisted I contact Bitcoin.  :)  My other guess was that there's some sort of 7-digit encoding of a private bitcoin key.
Anyway, I got the bitcoins as soon I entered the code.  For anyone is curious about the rate, here's the math:
I paid 55 uah for 0.008644 Btc.
The Bitcoin exchange rate at the time of the transaction was $365.
The uah exchange rate was 15.7.
So at market price, I would have received about 0.00958 btc.
In other words, I paid about 10% over the market price.
If you want to exclude the 2 uah fee that went to the terminal itself, it's about 7% over the market price.
edit: Now might be a good time for me to finally figure out bitcoin tipping.  :)

Hmmm.  I need something more serious than Madbitcoins, and not tied up with a specific service than Project Hidden.

That's exactly what I thought.  I called the bank to find out what website to visit.  Here is their website:   (Ukrainian language only).
After speaking with the lady I started wonder if the activation code isn't some sort of encoded private key.

Their launch was marked by non-stop scandals.  They claimed to be completely open source (they aren't).  They claimed to be decentralized (they aren't).  And if I remember correctly, they claimed to not be pre-mined (they weren't).
And now this crap.  They have a huge credibility problem.
Edit: it also seems like they hire professional internet trolls to argue with all the very reasonable resentment directed toward them.

Ripple had a very, very, very shady start, rife with false claims about being open source and decentralized, plus super slick, over-funded marketing.  I don't trust it.  I think they're going to try to use it to jump in front of the crypto currency movement and hi-jack the message.

Deniable encryption is a clever idea.  When my grandparents came the US in the 1950s they ran a grocery store in NYC and kept a small amount of money in the cash register even when they moved everything else to the safe.  Same idea -- (minus the encryption).

Guido Hulsmann is the best in my opinion -- the clearest and most rigorous:

I don't know which side Google is on.  I do know that they're probably trying to do damage control.  I do know that they made concessions to the NSA, unlike the CEO of Quest who took a stand and ended up in prison.
For these reasons, I'm taking these headlines with a grain of salt.  I can imagine the emotions are genuine.  I can also imagine them being part of Google's damage control.

You can tell the history of the world in terms of people attempting to use real money and government FORCING them to accept fiat.  There are examples from ancient China, the Roman Empire is the story a declining % of silver in their coins, and of course, it is the story today.
Bitcoins, I hope, are the people's freedom from the money monopoly.  They are a very, very big deal.

Bitcoin Banking would be the 100% reserve banking described by Rothbard and others.  *Demand deposit* accounts (guarded wallets, essentially) would have to differ from *time deposit* accounts, because when you're money is lent out, you can't access it.
