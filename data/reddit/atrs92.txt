Agreed, California needs to just fall off into the ocean already.

The only volatility I want to see is upwards in prices!

Thanks for posting this article. I skimmed through it and it was some useful information. But wow some of it makes me angry and is just wrong how the IRS is able to do this. I hope there is some overhauling with virtual currency taxation, I would rather not pay a arm and a leg to legally trade Bitcoin.

I don't really buy anything with Bitcoin. I do however make frequent bi-monthly purchases of Bitcoin using Coinbase. I like to hold onto all my coins and believe the price to make some steep climbs in the near future.

Get em' while they're  cheap!!!

I buy all my Bitcoins using Coinbase. 
However its not like I buy and sell, I strictly buy and hold onto everything I have. I have not once sold any of my Bitcoins.
Would I have anything to worry about or is the IRS just targeting people who buy and sell their Bitcoin.

First of all Bitcoin wasn't created to be regulated. The fact that Bitcoin doesn't fit cleanly into their "categories" is because it was never meant to. And you are wrong the IRS is 100% responsible for initiating the taxation of not just Bitcoin but all virtual currency. It sounds like you may not be too familiar with Bitcoin or how it is taxed. Im going to be truthful and admit I am not 100% fluent in the taxation of Bitcoin. But one of the new taxing methods is taxing Bitcoin miners on the amount of Bitcoin they have personally mined. That is the same principle as the IRS taking a portion of say gold you find on your property even though you own the mineral rights to that land. Some taxation is completely understandable especially as income earned or on purchases. 
I am actually more politically active than most. I stay up to date on almost all political matters and am a registered voter whom votes as often as I am able to.

I use the lawn mower app on iOS. Pretty simple set it up and any spare change left after a purchase is used to buy bitcoin.

If only I had gone through with it... 
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:34:59
That's the thing I can technically "afford" to lose $690/ month. However if Bitcoin were to crash I would be pretty upset.

I don't see the whole point in a Bitcoin bank. What kind of services would they offer that you can't do with a wallet of your own and a reputable exchange?
@_date: 2015-11-08 05:07:15
Thanks for the suggestion guys like I said it was just a thought. I Don't think I'm gonna go through with it.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:28:39
That's a good point, I will definitely be keeping an eye on the price and was hoping for slight drop before I spend $30k on BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:30:56
Yeah that's a great point and maybe It will be safer for me to just but 1-2 every month like I've been doing. But I would also hate myself if the price is upwards of a couple thousand per Bitcoin by the end of next year.

Nobody knows for sure what the future holds. However I believe that now is the best time to buy with currency and its relatively young stage and the adoption is growing everyday. I think that when the halving occurs the price is going to see a steep increase. So if you have the money remember:
Buy low, hold when the price is high, repeat.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:26:23
I highly doubt the price will fall when in theory the supply is getting cut in half. But nobody know for sure its definitely a risk.

The only place Bitcoin is going is to the moon.
@_date: 2015-11-08 05:11:12
Considering that there has been only one halving since the birth of Bitcoin yes the price did go up quite substantially.
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:23:07
5.38 billion now! To the moon!!!!!

I believe that 1 Bitcoin is going to become much more valuable than 1 ounce of gold very soon and with growing popularity and stability it won't decline like it did before.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:54:05
Negative nancy over here how about some optimism.
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:04:08
About 1500, the spike in the price will speed up adoption and encourage new Bitcoiners to invest boosting the price even more all the way to the moon!

I use Coinbase myself. I hear some people have issues but I think thats because they use their coins for illegal things. I personally have never had an issue in the 2-3 years I have been with them. Very reliable and easy to use some of the best prices you can find as well.
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:22:18
Buy now while the price is low. Bitcoin will never see 200 dollars again. And I believe that the price of Bitcoin now is cheaper than you will see it ever again.

Not really a gambler, but how can it be illegal in the US if the US doesn't even classify Bitcoin as a currency in the first place.
@_date: 2016-07-17 04:24:41
I am well aware with how these laws and regulations are written. I reponded to this post with the intention of making a point that if Bitcoin gambling is going to be illegal the least the government can do is classify it as a currency. I understand why it was made a law in the first place I just do not agree.
