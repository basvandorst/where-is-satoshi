Vinny Lingum was talking to the crowd at Coinsummit today and I asked him basically if he had any plans to do this or add any features that help people calculate their bitcoin-value-at-purchase and he said that of course it would be too onerous for merchants to manage that, it's the taxpayer's responsibility to make sure they are using after-tax cash for purchases in the same way it's their responsibility to make sure they're calculating what they owe on their own.

Don't worry, we received a LOT of emails in response to that joke calling us sellouts.  We take sustainability seriously.  Golden Coast Mead gives 1% of top-line revenue to bee research and only use locally sourced ingredients.  We even cultured our own local yeast from the Oceanside region to develop our Sour.  All of our funding has come directly from other people who share our values through Slow Money, an organization that shares a lot of the decentralized hopes and dreams of our fellow bitcoiners.

Now that those who have been using this "bug" (is it more of a glitch?) to exploit exchanges are aware that their scheme has been exposed, they're probably going to be more aggressive in exploiting it.

Think about printers these days.  Most of them have memory which stores a lot of what they print.

"Buy when blood is running in the streets" - Baron Rothschild
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:41:02
   Great deck and you really taught me something during the presentation.  The concept that if civilization was "run over" a thousand times, gold would always end up as money 1.0 was a novel concept to me.  I'm going to learn how to say it in a similar way to how you presented it in your deck, repeat it, and give you credit where it's due.
  Now to the constructive criticism.
-If you're not natural in front of a crowd, prepare more.  There was once when one brother handed the microphone to the other and the brother receiving the microphone said something to the effect of "no, it's still your turn."  That should never happen with people who understand the necessity for practice before a race.  Even if you're super nervous, you should have it all down so well that it is natural to you when you present.
-Know your audience: This was a group of seasoned financial-tech professionals who were probably, on average, a "2-3" on 1-10 bitcoin knowledge scale.  Your job, given only 12-15 minutes, isn't to get them to 10 or to understand appcoins or even smart property, it's to get them up to a "4-6" range.  Talk about the open ledger and analogize it to companies they know.  Differentiate "small b" bitcoin and "Big B" Bitcoin, the currency.
Sorry to do this on a public forum but it's not likely that our paths will cross again and I wanted to give you my thoughts.

What a shame that they actually developed software that might have been useful had it not been for such poor leadership.

I feel like arguing semantics at this point, between two people who both believe in bitcoin and want it to succeed, is pointless and counterproductive.  I agree with you that this lacks the maliciousness of a traditional pyramid scheme and so wouldn't be classified as one by the department of justice.  
You might admit that the only way my bitcoin is going to become worth more is if other people put money in and there's a chance that the last adopters will lose money when early adopters sell.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I'm in the same camp as [Naval Ravikant]( on this.

If I were the owner of these stolen coins right now I would be writing a program that indexed all the addresses in the blockchain which have been active in the last year.  Then I would take half of my stolen coins and divide them evenly between these addresses.  This might cut the price of bitcoin in half overnight, it might not, but it would incentivize enough bitcoin holders to embrace the remaining coins as valid.

Because nobody benefits from a system where the majority takes money from a minority IF there is a chance that the majority will enter into the minority.  In the case of America (your metaphor) it is only when a majority of people believe they will not become rich at some point that they vote to seize wealth from the minority (wealthy/wealth-producers).  There would have to be some pretty firm minority/majority lines drawn for that to be the case in bitcoin.

I'm not arguing that it's a negative aspect of bitcoin at all.  Early adopters are what is creating the incentive to create the bitcoin ecosystem.  It's fair that they be rewarded.  Bitcoin isn't out there innovating more tomorrow than it did today.  It isn't selling more units or building a gigafactory.  A bitcoin today has roughly the same properties as a bitcoin in 2019 whereas a share of Tesla represents a percentage of a very different company over time.  Does that make sense?

Two caveats:
1. The measure still needs to be approved by the European Central Bank commission
2.  This fee only seems that it will apply to cash withdrawals of 1,000 EUR or more, at which point it will be a fee of 1 EUR.
I don't see these caveats as making the announcement any less significant, though, as it's no far stretch to imagine that these fees for people to withdraw their own money (which has already been) can be increased over time.
Edit: It's appears to apply to all ATM withdrawals as well as all bank withdrawals over 1,000 euro.  Both of these will be hit with a 1 euro tax...for now.

Right, but right now someone could sell 41.7 bitcoin for $25,010, which is above the minimum reinvestment for BIT, where they could likely purchase 100 bitcoin.  So despite having low volume, it has enough bids to execute an arbitrage cycle.

This is probably the best possible outcome of the government auction.  Even if the coins were sold below "market" value, Tim is not a weak hand who would liquidate for the arbitrage opportunity.

I would focus on specific goals, like promoting our book event for "Age of Cryptocurrency" in DC next Wednesday.  
Then, when you accomplish the goal of promoting this event you get all the excitement and confidence building that comes from accomplishing goals, however modest.
Seriously, though, it seems like a total restart from the outside.  The best thing you could do would be to set 1-3 goals you can actually accomplish in the next six month that all have tangible results.

What a stupid crime.  I mean, you have the exact timestamp of when the transfers were made, so you could start constructing alibis for everyone on the team
who was logged in to a computer, etc.
Best case scenario you get the btc to a wallet without anyone knowing who did it, but still you know they'll know that SOMEONE did it and you know they'll be watching
So how do you enjoy the money?  They won't just stop watching and my guess being that embezzlement by agents is taken pretty seriously.
At the end of the day, though, this proves an important point about bitcoin: if this were cash, it's much less likely that the thief would have been charged.

From Brian at Shopify:
"Hey Everyone,
Just a quick update on this: our Bitpay integration is feature-complete and can be added to your store now. Due to the fact that it's a very new feature and not something we're ready to roll out to all stores just yet, you will need to contact me to have it enabled, and I may want to follow up with you for your feedback once you've been using it for a while, but it works. When active, Bitpay will appear as a credit card processor in the Checkout page of your shop admin - enter your access key and you'll be all set to go.
One caveat: at this time, Bitpay functions in the same way as the other credit card processors on Shopify, meaning that you can't use Bitpay in conjunction with Authorize.net, Stripe, or other credit card processors. PayPal Express Checkout can be used as a secondary option with Bitpay in the same way it can be used with all other gateways.
To activate, email me your shop URL at brian and I'll do my best to get everyone up and running promptly!"

You alluded to this fact, but actually getting bitcoins into the hands of new people is the best way to build a future adopter base.  I sell bitcoin fractionals online ( and the vast majority of my purchasers have read about bitcoins online but have no idea how to participate.  By giving them just a little bit they begin to feel ownership in the system and a great deal of them ask if there is a way they can buy more.  They're happy to wait a week for deposits to clear at that point.  I think that another way to do your part is to start selling fractionals to people who don't have any bitcoin at all or bartering with bitcoins.  It's a trick that precious metal investors have known for a long time.  Give a kid a silver coin and turn him into someone who will be fascinated with the metal the rest of his life.

Not so sure.  I remember thinking the same thing when gold broke through $1,000 for the first time.  I remember staying up basically all night watching it and thinking it would crash right after.  The momentum carried it up and up, though.  Bitcoin has some crazy momentum and I wouldn't be surprised if it surged or crashed or didn't do either.  I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't sell in anticipation of a crash at $1,0000
