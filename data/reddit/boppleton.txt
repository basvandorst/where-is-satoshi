gyft and similar services using BitPay do not give you a standard bitcoin public address, you get a payment invoice link which contains the address and total amount you are supposed to send.  a desktop wallet like Electrum can be used to send funds to an invoice link.
i found this tool which lets you extract the public address from a bitpay invoice, however i have not tried it.  I would recommend just getting Electrum wallet.. [

so you can trade actual bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase.  on a derivatives exchange like Bitmex, you are trading fake contracts that represent $1.00 worth of bitcoin, and you can borrow money to multiply your gains/losses (leverage).  so these red boxes are showing people that had up to $10,000,000 long positions (bet that the price will up), and the price went down below the point that they lose all of their money (liquidation).  so these liquidated LONG positions must then exit (sell) at whatever the current price is, because that is how the exchange doesn't lose the money they loaned to the gambler.

it does look good, and it's crazy how similar the numbers are.  however do not think that just because the dumps could be finished that it is going to just start chad candling back up.. transition from bear to bull is sideways and slow

if we follow this fractal you will have a few months of sideways to rack it up

obviously this could all be a meme.  but you cannot deny that it is a very spicy meme with potential

how do i remotely verify that it is real

if it were to keep mirroring the previous move, we would move up from here, then backdown to retest this range, then upwards

yes the boxes are not on any accurate points i just threw them on there, the accurate part is the 'price range' drawing tool which is strictly from the very tops and bottoms of the segments
