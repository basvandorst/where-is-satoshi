As someone who actually used this service heavily for a bit, I thought I'd show one of the use-cases.
In this case, it was the release of No More Room In Hell on Steam. This resulted in an explosion of the player base, and the version change at the same time happened to mean that almost all the servers online were suddenly out of date.
For around 5 days, every single server was full, all the time. I have a server of my own (physical hardware) and it was running as many instances as I could manage without compromising performance. As soon as an instance started, it was immediately full.
When posted in about Dawnplay I thought "This sounds perfect for the problem". I joined, chucked $20 at it and just fired up a ton of servers in Sydney. They didn't need to last long - the huge spike wasn't going to last and many other people were slowly bringing servers online, but the fact was that for that entire weekend we needed every server that could be made available.
Nobody else was offering this capability in a one-shot package like Dawn (as far as I'm aware anyway). Thanks to them (and my $20) a ton of people got to experience the game.
I don't think "deal with huge spikes" is a large-scale business model, but there's a clear use-case and one that doesn't require large numbers of humans involved in complex support. He could run this as a side business with almost no intervention if he wanted and use it to pay for his coffee even.
I reckon this spike thing is only going to get more serious over time however, and I believe that if the service is kept dead simple and he's aggressive about avoiding support then it'll more than pay for itself.
