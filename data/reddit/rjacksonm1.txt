Thanks a lot!

Ah, that's cool. I wasn't aware there was a new version of the site in the works.
And I agree - I don't intend to dethrone Coinmap with Crytomap - they both do the same job and Coinmap is more established.  I was just disappointed that I couldn't find an equivalent service when Coinmap stopped working for me, so I put this one together.

Thanks a lot!  I haven't been on the receiving end of Changetip before.  I'm super pleased you value my work enough to part with your own money! Thank you.

Oh, it works for you?  For me none of the site works, because Coinmap is loading a hosted version of Leaflet.js on a domain-name that does not resolve for me ( gives me "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN").  I've tested this on two UK ISPS: BT and Daisy.
As for being slow to update, I added tagged a new merchant on OpenStreetMap and after approximately a week it still was not being displayed on Coinmap - which I thought was an extraordinarily long time for the map to update.  The next time I checked Coinmap was not loading for me any more, so I've no idea if the node I was looking for is in Coinmap's data set now.
I started working on Crypto Map last night, primarily as a project to see how difficult pulling this data from OSM and rendering it is - turns out it's pretty easy.  Crypto Map should be a bit more resilient than Coinmap due to all of the dependencies being hosted with the site (so there won't be any issues with hosted content becoming inaccessible) and because it has Cloudflare sitting in front of the site, so even if my server goes down the site should still run just fine (though Coinmap is hosted on Github pages, so that shouldn't be afflicted by any server problems either).

Just added filtering!  It's a bit slow, but does the job. :D

Just their website: 
I haven't used it very much.  I've heard of it before, but never really though about building anything with it until I recently tweeted a joke: "Quick tip to stop being XSS'd: Write a static website". Then I realised my own website was guilty of being unnecessarily dynamic so I re-wrote it with Jekyll.
Starting this project I thought the same: Everything required for this project can be done client-side, so I'll just write a static site.  I opted to use Jekyll instead of just writing a single HTML page so if I wanted add extra pages to the site (e.g. guides walking through how to update an OpenStreetMap node to note it accepts a cryptocurrency) I can do so easily without repeating a bunch of code.
Turns out I was a little bit wrong - not everything can be done client-side.  When playing around with fetching data from OpenStreetMap it was way to slow to do it on the fly - especially if I wanted a large macro overview of Bitcoin acceptance around the world.  It would take a couple of minutes to get all of the OpenStreetMap nodes that accept a cryptocurrency.  I thus decided to offload the job of data collection and updating on to the server, and set up a cron job to update it hourly..

Are you sure?  It appears to work fine for me on IE9, IE10, IE11 (on Desktop).
Can you let me know if any errors are coming up in the browser's dev console?

I've grown up tinkering with technology, so it's hard to put an exact figure on it.  I would say I've been doing software-development at a professional level for ~5 years, and then spent probably about ~5 years before that tinkering around with various projects.
With this project in particular, there's not a whole lot going on.  I'm using Jekyll as a static-site generator to put together the layout of the site (it doesn't really need Jekyll, but it'll be handy if I start adding other pages or a blog to the site).  I have a [Python script]( that's pulling the data down from OpenStreetMap and storing it, and then a [Javascript file]( creating the map and populating it with markers.
A lot of the very complicated work was done for me with libraries such as [Leaflet.js]( or offloaded by using services such as [OpenStreetMap]( for the data.  I just had to stitch it all together.

I've just implemented filtering! It's a little laggy, but that's something I'll try and improve over the coming weeks.
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:00:48
Ah, I think that issue is due to the fact the map was rendering all of the merchants on the map (which is an expensive process).
I have just pushed some performance optimizations live, including only rendering markers for merchants in the visitor's bounding-box, as well as reducing the default map overview from the whole world to just around London (otherwise it'll still try to load all the markers).  This should greatly improve the time for the map to first render, and then as you move around more content will be loaded in.
With regards to ram usage, I'll have to see what I can do to optimize that, but I suspect it will always be rather high due to the map loading in nearly 6,000 merchant nodes (loading the nodes increases RAM usage from about 70MB to 250MB).
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:53:55
Yeah I know what you mean. That's a consequence of me adding separate cluster layers for different cryptocurrencies so you can filter by currency.
 What I need to do is have a single cluster layer which has the different cryptocurrencies as layers underneath, so all of the nodes cluster together, but can still be filtered by currency.
I'm going to spend some time tonight trying to sort that out.
Edit: Turns out just adding sublayers to a single MarkerClusterGroup really doesn't work well.  It doesn't seem like there's an easy elegant solution to this.  I'll keep looking into it.

Yes, the data about bitcoin-accepting merchants is pulled through from OpenStreetMap - they're the nodes in OSM where "payment:bitcoin" is set to "yes".
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:08:42
I think I must be being served an old version of the page from the whichever of Github page's caching servers is closest to me.  This could also explain the whole "Slow to update" problem I was having - it could just be that the cache was serving me old data.
I'll have to wait for that edge cache to update then, until then I'll continue to be stuck with a broken coinmap.

Would buy.  Ship to UK please .
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:31:17
That's a good point.  I think I'll add a little note to the site suggesting people contact businesses before turning up to make sure the map is still up-to-date (and asking them to remove the node from the map if a business no longer accepts a cryptocurrency).

You need backups of the seed, and the seed is somewhat of a backup in of itself.  If you don't have a wallet backup and you lose your seed, you lose your money.

So what's Circle's gig?  How are they making money from this?

It *was* a joke, but it is legitimately gaining fruition. The 'doge' facade certainly wont do it any favours with being perceived as legitimate/serious - in the eyes of general business folk, that is; however among (young?) tech savvy individuals it seems rather popular.
I'm curious as to how long it will last/how sustainable it will ultimately become in various kinds of markets.
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:49:30
That works in the context of a recurring payments, sure, but it's not exactly as practical as stealth addresses intend to be. Furthermore, your solution doesn't solve one problem which stealth addresses do - receiving multiple payments from multiple people without your involvement (i.e there is no per-payor setup you need to do), all the while those transactions remain disassociated with each other. 
The idea of using deterministic addresses is one way of doing this, but that has some flaws which the stealth address proposal outlines.   I'm on a mobile at the minute, so I'm afraid I can't link or quote the relevant sections. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:33:23
Search for oclvanitygen.  It's basically a tool which brutes forces the creation of new addresses until one (or many) matching your input pattern is found.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:24:20
Ah, thanks.  [I see that's actually happening quite frequently]( and I'm assuming most of these aren't malicious - as the Blockchain site says they typically occur when two miners produce a block at a similar time.
Could you explain how the protocol handles orphaned block chains, e.g. if there are two competing blocks mined.  What is to stop there being a chain built upon both (which could provide *n* confirmations to a transaction, which are later orphaned), and how does the protocol decisively determine which block to "adopt" for the main block chain?

If you want a business or retailer to accept bitcoin, and you would actually buy their services with bitcoin, just fire them a tweet or email registering your interest.
There is no need for a ”worldwide twitter campaign”, if anything that's just a positively worded way of asking people to spam others - it comes off as aggressive, immature, and downright annoying.  Furthermore, businesses should make their decisions based off of their customer base, so let that customer base contact them and let the business have accurate data with regards to their customer bases interest, I.e. a ”worldwide twitter campaign” just pollutes data, e.g. a UK high street retailer probably doesn't give two shits about 20-30 Americans asking them to support bitcoin, because those 20-30 Americans aren't going to be shopping at that retailer any time soon / with any regularity.
@_date: 2014-01-17 13:08:04
I'm curious - are they simply auctioning a wallet.dat containing all the relevant addresses excluding the private keys (encrypted wallet?), or are they in actuality selling 26,655 usable Bitcoins?

ZipZap ran a small private beta test for a few days just short of 2 weeks ago.  I got an e-mail inviting me to it, but I think I misinterpreted and thus didn't sign up to participate myself - so I haven't got any first-hand experience actually using the service.
They're certainly busy developing it, however.

I only recently got involved with Bitcoins, but I do want to get involved and help out however I can.  I can easily spin up a (linux) VPS to run as a full node, but I'm not 100% on the details - do I just install and run bitcoind?
Are there any particular settings I should tweak for a node to utilize all the VPS has to offer, e.g. bandwidth / processing power?

A guy made a sign showing with a bitcoin address, the sign was visible in the background of an ESPN broadcast so people donated to it, and now that address holds 22BTC (~$24,200). Kid got fucking rich from making a sign!
