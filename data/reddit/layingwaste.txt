"Listen, when someone says to me, the price is going to zero, what are you going to do, I'm not going to let it go to zero," he explained. "I'm going to implement something. If the market drops precipitously, we'll stop trading, and if we think a product is going away, we have the longs, we have the shorts, we'll match them up at a price and that's the way our rules read today." - CME

So we are clear, B-Value-reserve is a reserve of EMERGENCY VALUE
In the case bitcoin has a catastrophic event The following will happen:
As bitcoin reaches a dangerously low value, B-Value-reserve will save the day, (thanks B-Value-reserve) donating all of its value into bitcoin and allow it to recover to an all time high. RINSE AND REPEAT.
thank you for your time. and thank you for your sacrifice B-Value-reserve believers!
