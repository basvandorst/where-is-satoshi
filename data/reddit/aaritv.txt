So are some of the HODLers

While I don't care too much for Kim DotCom I welcome any lightning adaption we can get. So we should somewhat care imho.

I mean... The CEO of Starbucks sadly already said that he won't use BTC as  payment option
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:24:41
While I enjoy the current progress that BTC is making we shouldnt be too confident in the "low" Mempool. There is a good chance we going up a lot again after next difficulty adjustment. Segwit adoption is still not nearly where it should be at. The other scaling solutions (Schnorr) can't come fast enough. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:19:45
It is a fair assessment during these times. Lightning and Segwit are indeed showing some initial success but are not fully there yet (SegWit mainly because of poor adoption and Lightning simply isnt finished yet)

Thing is. I don't understand why they would even list it as degraded in the first place. They ALWAYS use the maximum Fee to garuantee the next block. So there they dont rly care about the Network performance...  Its purely propaganda
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:32:09
That's so amazing. I'd love to see it up to end of this year. Is that something you will do?
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:25:56
Yes. They said that they have never recieved any deposist and that there is nothing in reservation.

I have a similar issue with GDAX. For me my € Withdraw has not been sent to my bank since December 12th!  
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:19:51
You spent BTC to buy stuff and then you buy more BTC with the FIAT you didn't spent.   
Lets be honest tho. With the current fees noone will use BTC as a means of payment.   
LN and other ways to improve the network can't come fast enough.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:46:39
That's weird. I can't seem to find that E-Mail. The last one I got from GDAX/Coinbase was "Please invest responsibly — an important message from the Coinbase team".  
Well hopefully the money will arrive...

I sold yesterday evening (im from Germany) because I didn't want to deal with all this shit about Bcash and the fear that was being spread. Woke up this morning at 8am. Price was lower then I sold at. Slept for another hour and it exploded.  
Lost some potential gains but im fine with it. Still annoying that I fell for that stupid bcash FUD. 
Off to the moon now! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:35
Oh yea I am. Im not letting go of my BTC unless I really need the money for some reason. I made the mistake of weak hands before. Not happening again. The € price (im from Germany) dropped by 2400 tho. Was crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:01:15
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. As I said. I will just buy and restrain myself from selling / being influenced as much. I learned from it and don't mind just hodling it for a longer period now. These small differences in price bearly made a difference anyway in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:29:01
What debts? Im from Germany and I can't fathom how young people have debts tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:33:04
Because im stupid. I should just buy and not look at anything related to BTC/BCH for a year or so. I get scared too easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:19
Its already recovering strongly. But holy shit that was scary. I checked my phone while I was downstairs and suddenly saw such a low number. Rushed up asap but was already going back up.  
Got a bit scared there for a minute
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:18:49
You know that quite well that I didn't mean the increase in Blocksize thanks to segwit. I'm sure you also understand that that was not was I was talking about, if not then maybe you should be the one educating themselves.  
This blind hate on this increase is quite irresponsible at this point. Fees are already well above 1USD again
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:10:26
Yea thats what im doing now. Already ordered a Trezor :)
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:36:14
Yea. This is really starting to become an issue. I really hoped we could just do a sensible increase to 2MB blocksize until LN is actually fully ready for normal people to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:27:40
Yea. Im not too "hurt" about this. As you said, a learned lesson. Overall im still ahead in money so the only thing I lost is some earnings.
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:36:19
It wasnt Binance that got hacked tho. It was through people that used a Third party to open up their API for Trading. Binance did nothing wrong and actually acted perfectly. Withdraws were halted and the trades will be rolled back.

I don't think asking for proof should be considered trolling from another subreddit. It is a legit question. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:00:37
Noone knows. Noone can know. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:36:33
Don't you see? Bubble popped. We going to 1$, it's over. What goes down never comes up. /s
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:09:04
Or she will love him even more. Also it's not like his mother will hate him over lost money if it drops more. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:39:29
Credit card yes. Blocking Debit Card purchases is not ok.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:12:05
But wouldn't they want to accept crypto now especially because they would expect the price to go up again? Or am I thinking too simple here? I'd say its more because Samsung is entering the market.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:09:34
That's not how it works. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:35:21
For sure. I think we can all agree that the Market FUD has hit Bitcoin/Crypto pretty hard in January. It just got back up and will (hopefully) continue to do so. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:50:51
Ah yea makes sense that the buyers (miners) wouldn't wanna spent it so Bitmain is pressured to add USD payment to keep customers coming. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:41:11
