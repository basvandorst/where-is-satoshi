Very nice. I got similar with 4 monitors. I like the stream deck. Wish I could get one, what u use it for?
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:59:10
What mining software do u use and what do u mine? Cause right now it’s not profitable no matter what software I use. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:35:32
I’ll try that, thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:50:42

@_date: 2018-06-19 04:41:34
Ha why not?
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:51:09
What would u want it to say then?
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:41:52
That’s a sick idea never thought of that
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:06:07
Lol why u buy at the peak!
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:34:29
Lol, it’s a whale manipulating the asset and means nothing
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:09:12
At laughter again but it wasn’t like that in 2017.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:03:28

Very informative article about “How to hodl”

Ok well this is a picture of the wallet directly telling my I had $700, top left. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:14:54
They sent me this but these transactions were from September which doesn’t matter because I had the $700 in my account 2 days ago
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:20:19
I’m sharing this link with google drive is it not working?
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:31:09
Sorry I posted this on 2 subreddits because it failed on this one but then it posted it. The other post had bunch of links. But thx for your help, I’m in contact with exodus support now. And I didn’t mean to be sarcastic it just came out like that in text
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:45:18
Ok but why did my wallet tell me I had $700 in my account in this picture from 2 days ago??
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:10:31
Here is 2 photos I took when trying to make the transaction in the wallet. 
 
What else could I share for evidence?
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:49:04
Explain this

I didn’t send money to myself, but apparently I didn’t. And ya the fees are ridiculous

Ok, there’s quite a few comments. I took this picture 2 days ago when doing the transaction. Top left it says I have $700 worth of btc in my wallet. Why does it say this when u guys r saying the wallet has nothing. And why would they charge fees if I’m sending it to the same wallet, and why is that possible anyway. I also never have sent any money out of this wallet so whyyyyyy??
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:43:35
I never authorized this, why did this happen??
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:00:09
It didn’t have a transaction id from the $700 being taken from my account, only this other link they emailed my saying I depleted my account from September when I had the $700 in BTC 2 days ago. 
Here’s the link from September’s transactions that they gave me that don’t matter. 
 
I’m a beginner in using crypto and blockchain keep in mind. Maybe I missed something.

That’s crazy it thought my $4 was $700. That’s not it something else went wrong with exodus
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:01:57
Can you explain my situation though?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:42:49
They hate what they don’t understand.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:13:10
I’m looking at my wallet history now and I have never sent any money from this wallet. I’ve only deposited BTC into it. Explain this.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:36:45
Ok well I’ve sent the address and u all said I never had the $700 I put in there even though Exodus told me this. But I guess my money is gone.  Nice
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:56:14
I’m out right now maybe in a few hours. Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:01:28
Well, HODLing is long long term investing, and $700 hodling isn’t that profitable.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:40:26
The picture was not forged exodus told me the wrong amount that was in my wallet, even though nothing was there. Thx for ur help anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:11:51
I should but now I only have .0004 btc in my wallet .08 ish BTC disappeared from my wallet last night making the transaction. And no record of it on my wallet history.
