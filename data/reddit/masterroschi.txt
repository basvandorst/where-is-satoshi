I know how you feel tbh. The more I dive into crypto the more this life seems like it's not right for some reason. I look at money differently in terms of stores of value now while coins and paper money seems so archaic and obsolete yet our civilizations are based off it it.
Money doesn't really seem real to me anymore, we just value the concept.

I transferred some things last night at a 1 sat per byte fee with a day and a half waiting period. I was in no rush to receive but it transfered within 10 minutes. I was highly impressed, I think it cost under 10 cents but it just got me thinking if there was ways to make it even cheaper.
Like wait for it to be over 10,000 usd with 1 sat per byte as opposed to the price at 9000 usd with 1 sat per byte.
Or is it a waste of time cause It would be fractions of a penny saved?

I've only talked to a few people irl about Bitcoin and noone really seems to care. 
Aristotle wrote it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea without accepting it and I think if you aren't even willing to be curious enough to at least look into it rather than listen to what trump or buffet may have said then I don't think they deserve to be apart of something potentially so great.
Why stay in the dark fighting over paper when you could stop and say "but what if"
If this comes crashing down and fails.. oh well I'm out a few thousand but who cares, my bills are still paid and I'm still alive. Life goes on..
But if this really is the start of something then we truly are the frontiers of a new digital age.

I know it's about the data size, but if I wanted the best bang for my bits so to speak then I would want to transfer at a time when the price is high but the mempool is low correct?
Or is the price completely irrelevant and I should just pay attention to the mempool?

step two: get caught

I've read this on a few other posts but I can really seeing it turn into a war between corporate money, government money and the people's money. Where btc won't be used for day to day transactions but more like a digital stock pile of gold used as a savings account. Btc will be very easy to convert into their currencies but it will be very expensive to obtain. Just day dreaming (day nightmaring?) But I can see the governments stance on this to be "if you can't beat them, join them. I.e. if it's seems like you may loose, infiltrate you're opponent and learn how to take over from the inside)

I really appreciate how informative this post is, thank you for clearing up some confusion. 
Do you think there is potential to not necessarily make a new currency but rather introduce a new way to spend the current currency. Thus competing with btc using a completely digitalized USD that is accepted through a direct link to the current world banking system to allow it to be spent without third parties like paypal. Even if btc were to stay as a commodity, on a world wide scale we can still choose to use it as a form of currency in the near future.
As I wrote it out it does seem pretty far of a stretch but just curious on your opinion of any such possibilities.

(this is not investing advice and I do not recommend this at all, this is just my 2 sats)  
What Ive collected as of now is for long term hodls no matter the market, even if everything crashes to shit I'm ok with the idea of all or nothing. I now plan to dollar cost average every two weeks into a new account and use these assets for short term with access to liquidity. If the odds are in my favour and I end up selling at the ATH i will liquidate my profits and reinvest initial investment and start over with the next crash/dip/correction.  
But everything up until now I consider already lost and will not be touched.  
Don't invest in greed, invest in the future.

I have a trezor and i'm happy with it. I see zero need to change or even upgrade from the model one to the model T for that matter. Its easy to use but it doesn't support anywhere near the amount of coins that the ledger does.   
With that being said, the only coin it doesn't support that I happen to be interested in is monero.. But even that I believe the model T already supports it or will soon in the very near future so i'm sure the model one will support it soon enough as well.   
Open source is what ultimately led me to my decision.

There are many reputable crypto exchanges out there, depending on where you are located you may have a limited selection to choose from. As u/tabletennis763 stated, start by searching on google and DYOR on the different exchanges you read about, then you can make better decisions and search more specific questions.  
Be prepared that most require KYC. if you choose to find non KYC options there is a higher chance of paying premium prices or the possibility of getting scammed.

Tell me if I'm understanding this correctly, I think I rather have a slight grasp on this or I completely don't understand.
I go to bakkt and tell them "I will pay 1btc (10,000usd) now to bet on btc being worth 100,000usd in 2 years. Then when those two years are up and 1 btc is worth 150,000usd, I will only pay 100,000usd for 1 btc. but if it was only worth 80,000usd. I would still have to pay 100,000usd worth of btc.
Is this even slightly correct?

I mean tbh, it won't even surprise me if the price sky rockets right after instead lol... But i'm basing my decision off of everybody always buys the rumour and sells the news.  
This is a complete gamble at this point and I definitely won't be selling my entire bag, but I will be selling a large enough chunk that will either set me back quite a bit or substantially put me ahead.
Time will tell.
It will be so bitter sweet if it just continues to rise and never dips below 10 again. At least then I will have full faith in the future of crypto.

My dad told me about it when I was younger, He said there was this internet money mostly used for a website called silk road. He told me people mostly use it to buy drugs but the bitcoin its self was becoming more expensive and might be the future one day. (I think I remember him telling me it was worth a about a dollar at that time) I was old enough to know exactly what he was talking about and was super interested in a future online currency but I wasn't old enough to think I could find it myself so I forgot about it until it started gaining traction again at the beginning of 2017. My fucking jaw dropped, I couldn't believe it was still around but being a fool not realizing how easy it actually was to find I didn't try to acquire some because I still thought of it as a silk road drug laundering money. So here I am today happily stacking sats while I think to myself "holy fuck.. I actually knew about bitcoin when it was first around but I didn't truly know how much potential it would have on the future."
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:47:55
I don't think it would be the government as a whole that is necessarily behind it and I also don't think that the ones who are involved can continue doing it forever.
  
I do believe in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general as the future currency but people talk of the fall of the USD like its just something thats going to casually happen. I'm sure there is so much at play right now behind closed doors that we can even begin to grasp the true reality of it all.
It's easy to talk conspiracy theories all day but above all else, if I saw an opportunity to use an extremely large stake in a new unregulated asset in order to increase my net worth even more it would absolutely be in my best interest to find others in a similar position and use our power as a whole to achieve our own agenda at the expense of others. I would spend millions to hire others who are true believers to make websites and write blog posts and talk about all the good things that crypto will bring and how much money there is to be made to ensure the trust of the average person looking to bitcoin for the first time.
If i'm completely wrong in all of this, that will be the best news I could ever find out and I will begin to create the most aggressive investing plan my net worth can handle.
I don't know if ill ever know for sure if i was wrong for thinking this but I will start to become suspicious that I may be on to something by starting to pay attention to the news and FUD and dips with a larger perspective and start to look for patterns as a whole.  
The trick to business is to zig when every body zags.. And right now every zag out there is saying the exact same thing. It just seems a little too much.
I believe the moon is out there and I hope we all make it.
But i'm starting to think theres a little more at play than what we might be aware of.
