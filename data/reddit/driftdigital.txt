Here are a few for you to consider:
* Slide 3, change "Virtual" to "Digital".
* Slide 7, change "About" to "Over". Or if the number isn't actually over 60k, change it to "Over 50,000...". Emphasizes the growing network. 
* Slide 11, I agree with J2383. Remove "a bit like BitTorrent". Replace with "A peer to peer network" or similar.
* Slide 18, change "Universal" to "Global".
I would also suggest using the [Titlecase]( scheme for capitalization, but that is personal preference.

The person selling the Bitcoin is the one who pays the fee on LBC. 
As a buyer, you should receive the agreed upon amount. Note that sellers on Localbitcoins will usually mark their coins up a bit (the cost of convenience), and it is also possible that you keep buying right before the dips.

Step two asks for 8 letter words, but the example shows 6 letter words. Hopefully that 8 is not a typo.

To start off : the price of Bitcoin is governed by supply and demand. It is possible to purchase $110 worth of Bitcoin and have it's value drop, though it could just as easily increase in value. If you need $110 worth of Bitcoin, it is a good idea to purchase a little extra to act as a buffer.
To clarify : Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places, allowing you to send fractions of a cent if you so require.
Bitcoin is irreversible, there are no chargebacks. Because of this, it is too easy to Paypal someone money, receive your Bitcoin, then perform a chargeback. As a result, you are extremely unlikely to find anyone legitimately selling Bitcoin for Paypal.
If you're in the US, you have a few options. There is no 'best' place to get Bitcoin, but where you purchase from will depend on your needs.
If you don't mind linking a bank account and verifying your identity, you can visit coinbase.com or circle.com . These are registered businesses and risk purchasing from them is low. You will pay them a 1% fee for using their service but they are overall headache free.
If you would prefer not to link a bank account, you can try purchasing from someone near you. localbitcoins.com connects buyers and sellers of bitcoin around the world, locally. Options will vary depending on where you live, but you can usually find someone to do a face to face trade for cash, or someone that will release Bitcoin to you after you have deposited money into their bank account. Localbitcoins has multiple escrow options to ensure both parties fulfill their side of the bargain.

Critics are quick to remind us that we are down on the year. Staring at the charts of bubbles long gone and thinking that was all it was, all it could ever be. What they've failed to realize is that for every day the miners continue verifying transactions, we get one day closer to the next halving. For every headline announcing Bitcoin's demise, new users join our ranks and discover that the rumors of Bitcoin's death have been greatly exaggerated. 
We are in a down-trend now, and that's fine; but as long as the fundamentals are true, it can't go down forever. Eventually this distribution phase will come to a close and things will really start to get interesting.

The money *is* received instantly, the confirmations are what take time. 
The confirmations are 'verifications' of your payment by the network. If a payment isn't verified at least 3 times within 6 hours, something is most likely wrong with the payment. Most payments will receive their first verification within 10 minutes.

You're exactly right, there isn't much incentive for the average person to use Bitcoin right now. 
Here is one possible scenario that creates that incentive:
As more and more vendors continue to accept Bitcoin, we should begin to see the emergence of 'closed loops', in which vendors are able to transact entirely in Bitcoin. A business in one of these loops will have an advantage over those who are not (no chargebacks, lower tx fees, funds can't be arbitrarily frozen, network operates 24/7, etc.). These savings will naturally be passed on to the customer. There is your incentive. Would you pay a 1% fee (or lower, as Circle and Coinbase begin to see more competition) to save 3%?
The average person doesn't care about a limited money supply, maintaining their privacy, or any of the other things that make Bitcoin unique and interesting; but they do care about saving money.
Just some thoughts I've been toying with, not trying to push Bitcoin on you or anything. :)
Anyway I'm rambling, but thank you for your perspective!

My point is that that account is run by a bot. Literally every single comment is a reply to Changetip, and the bot seems to only have a few phrases to choose from.

Looking at one of your random tips, I came across . This user appears to be a bot that responds to with random Bitcoin-positive phrases. lol. Going to sleep now but I would be interested to see if there are more bots like this.
