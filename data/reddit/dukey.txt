When the bank buys bonds they give the 100 dollars to the government. The government can then spend those dollars in the economy. Just the money is created as new money. If that is the only money in existence where does the money come from to pay the interest? The government can only pay back the principal which is 100 dollars. It's impossible to pay back 110 because only 100 exists.

A net level, you are thinking at a local level. Imagine no money exists. Government issues bonds which the central bank buys for say $100. So now $100 dollars exists in circulation. Bonds have a return on investment of say, 10% to make the maths easy. After a year, the government pays back the $100 (the principal) to the central bank. Where does the extra $10 dollars come from to pay the interest? It doesn't exist in circulation. Mathematically it's impossible to pay. There are 2 choices, liquidate assets to pay the debt, or borrow more money to pay the interest. And the latter in boom times is why debt is exploding.
If you can get your head around this you'll see why eventually the central bank will own everything. In Japan where the debt to gdp ratio is over 200%, which is into the completely insolvent region the central bank has basically bought the entire economy. They own 70+ % of the entire stock market.
As for the fractionAL reserve ratio at your local bank, it 100% does give the bank the power to issue money out of nothing, as long as they don't exceed the ratio, which I think is usually around 10%. Imagine a bank holding gold for people. Gold is not so easy to cut up if you want smaller transactions so the bank would give out gold certificates. These certificates people would then end up using as money, knowing any time if they wanted that amount in gold they could go and swap the certificates for it. The banks figured they could issue more certificates than they had actual gold for .... And this system would work, on the condition that not everyone would want their gold back at the same time. If everyone wanted their gold back (run on the bank) people would be fucked because it doesn't exist. Instead of making this fraud illegal, it because the basis of our modern financial system, and it was seen as a good thing, because the amount of money grew with the economy essentially.

I'm well aware of the magic bullet theory and the impossible physics of 9/11.

The problem is money is created as debt. And in order to pay off the interest on the debt, more money is borrowed. At a net level, the money to pay off the interest doesn't exist, so the money supply is expanded by new money being loaned into circulation. This is why debt everywhere is almost parabolic. This constant dilution of money leads to inflation and a decreasing in the purchasing power of that currency. The problem isn't the currency, it's the central banks. Governments should have the power to issue debt free money, not the quasi private central banks. And local banks shouldn't have a fractional reserve ratio, they should only be allowed to loan money they have on deposit. The system we have in place relies, or fundamentally needs perpetual growth to be sustainable. A gold or bitcoin backed currency couldn't be abused in this way, but at the same time do you really want a growing economy to be reliant on a currency with only a fixed amount? That would lead to deflation, which for holders of debt would be horrible. The ideal inflation rate for a currency should be 0. You don't want your debts to be growing with deflation and you don't want your savings eaten by inflation.

If the rate of inflation is higher than the interest rate you have in your bank account you effectively already have negative rates.

If you never sell what's the point? Very few places accept bitcoin as payment. And places that do accept bitcoin would probably convert it straight away into $s because the currency is so volatile you wouldn't want to hold it for any period of time. Bitcoin is primarily used as a vehicle for speculative investment, with one of the largest bubbles ever in history. The question is who will be the bag holders.

I think that's the biggest issue, the supply of crypto currencies is almost unlimited, and the market has been flooded with them. The other issue is the currently bitcoin is too volatile. No one would hold debt in a currency that is sky rocketing. And no one would want to hold currency that is collapsing in value. I'm sure it will even out but getting there will be painful.

Bitcoin was a classic bubble bursting.

It's not an investment, you are a currency speculator.
