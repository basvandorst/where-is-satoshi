I'm from here, not r/all. Funny coming from a "redditor for 3 weeks" like you.
You must have been asleep from 2014-2016. A good store of value doesn't swim in the basement for 3+ years between periods of extreme volatility - believing otherwise is pure idiocy. What goes up can sure as F go down again and BTC has been down far more than it's been up, but keep fanboying.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:28:38
And where are your facts, shill?
I've never seen a darker pot calling out kettles in my life - nor have I ever seen more shitposts in a posting history as yours. Pull your head out of your ass.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:22:49
Any point can be made about any subject by artificially limiting scope to a favorable time span, but yours isn't even good at that - if you look from 12/1/13 to 12/1/15 your point falls apart completely. 
Zoom out, don't be myopic. Good stores of value aren't this volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:58:13


You must not be paying attention for more than a few months at a time. There is no indication that this will be a long term truth.

I've been in this sub longer than I've been in any other, I have as much right to post here as you do. I own BTC - what other requirements are there to be here? What exactly do you think I'm shilling? The only BCH I have is that which I got free in the fork.
The public certainly does see high fees as a big issue, saying otherwise is simply a lie. I'd love to see BTC succeed, I own as much of it as any other crypto - but that doesn't mean I'm going to bury my head in the sand. There are huge issues currently.
This fanboyism over certain coins is so silly - judge them on their real merits, not on sentiment.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:54:02
Keep telling yourself that, but it won't make it true. Everybody is now aware of BTC's issues, they aren't getting any better, and the plans to fix things aren't sufficient nor realistic.
This awareness goes far beyond reddit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:23:15
Specifically 2014.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:37:32
The only BCH I have is that which I got free in the fork and I still have all the BTC that I ever bought. I'm no BCH fan, but keep repeating that narrative - doesn't do anything for you other than make you look foolish. 
I love BTC, I want it to succeed - but I'm not going to bury my head in my ass and ignore the real issues that are currently ruining it.
You are barking up the wrong tree here, Fido - simply yelling "brigade" doesn't make the real issues brought up go away, especially when it's not a brigadier but actually one of your own that you are yelling at.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:14:58
I don't even know who you are talking about, nor do I care - I've never seen anybody use that name without "Cash" for BCH. You need to focus on real issues instead of fanboy bullshit - this is just distracting you from BTC's real problems and makes you look foolish. 
Maybe spend some time away from reddit if you think this is such a huge issue - because the truth is that people outside of here don't give a fuck about this silly BCH vs BTC BS, but they are very much aware of and focused on BTC's real issues.

How so? He has billions and everybody who knows who he is respects him greatly.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:14:40
Another "article" with no link to it's source, great.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:03:29
What happened was that if you needed to access your storage of value in that time, you got screwed. A good store of value doesn't swim in the basement for years.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:26:32
Like a week :/ Card is much faster with them than bank xfer.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:20:35
Bitcoin has absolutely no need for PR at this point unless you want to turn it into a ponzi scheme - everybody knows what it is already. What it does need is real work on it's technical issues that are keeping it from scaling well to user numbers it already has, let alone new users swayed by publicity stunts.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:49:13
That's Disney, actually.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:29:25
News is under no obligation to be neutral since the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine decades ago, and crypto markets are unregulated. In short, there was no chance of any law being broken here, not to mention that the article is total crap anyway, citing no real evidence whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:10
Still rising :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:04:26
It's not a currency though - if it were, then using it to buy a cup of coffee wouldn't cost more in fees than the coffee itself.

When was the last time he listened to anybody?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:37:39
They only want it because it's "free".

I consider everything you've said bullshit, so no.
Go play some more Pokemon, you are in over your head here.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:55:01
I never said a majority of the things you are trying to force into my mouth.
All I said is that there will *always* be places that USD is accepted. The same cannot be said about any crypo. Quit misrepresenting my argument.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:48
Ignoring the way the world is because it's not how you want it to be isn't clear thinking - it's more akin to insanity.
But whatever floats your boat man. If you think all world governments will collapse tomorrow then by all means prepare for that - but you are going to be waiting a long time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:05:21
It will always be true that merchants are forced to accept dollars BY LAW, and that will never be true of Bitcoin - that might not be inherent, but it's just as good in practice.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:21:09
LOL no, you are just missing my point altogether.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:48:29
LOL wow, you really have yourself convinced of your own bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:29:16
That's irrelevant to my point, and to yours.
It still works in national markets, wherever else it may as well. Fact is that there are some merchants that are forced to ALWAYS accept dollars - doesn't matter where they are located.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:57:58
No, I'm saying the US Dollars will always be accepted, and forced to be accepted by law, as long as the US exists as a nation - that's all I'm saying.
At this point I have no idea what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:20:25
Ok. 
If you say so.
I never said anything contrary to any of that, however. Perhaps you are confused as to who you've been arguing with. None of which changes the fact that BTC is on a huge bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:21:25
Every merchant in the USA.
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:12:56
Coinbase is fine, don't buy the FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:46:52
The only thing that caused this bubble pop were the people who bought and bought even when it was clearly a bubble, who all then panicked at the first dip. 
Anybody who didn't have their head buried in a dark hole knew it was a bubble, and knew the correction was coming.
HODL on and please stop with the FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:15:01
As the subsequent plummet shows, that dip was coming anyway - this didn't cause it. Trying to say otherwise is pure fantasy.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:54:28
Can't take the heat, huh?
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:11:53
They did.

Trumptards will grasp at straws to undermine him at any chance.

I was able to purchase immediately with debit card when I first started using Coindesk, no lengthy authorization needed. Not looking for huge amounts.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:22:59
Too late for what? Bitcoin isn't ending tomorrow.
Every purchase I've made so far has been immediately available - until Coinbase's dubious policy decisions this week. I just want business as usual.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:24:57
I'm sorry but you are wrong, I started buying and transferring immediately when I joined Coinbase. Credit and debit card funding sources require no lengthy verification.
