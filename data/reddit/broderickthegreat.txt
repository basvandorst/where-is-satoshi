Absolutely, but for the opposite reason of diversification in traditional markets. Diversify in crypto bc the more solid coins you own the more chances one goes absolutely insane 10x, 100x, whatever. I diversify and hodl coins and it only takes one going vertical to boost your entire portfolio. I personally have platform assets like ETH, NEO, ADA as well as privacy coins like Monero, Dash, ZCash etc and decentralized exchange coins like Kyber, ZeroX. It’s good to cover different sectors/use cases and imo have a stake in everything you believe in because you never know when something is going to go through the roof. 
 
TL/DR: Diversify in crypto to increase your odds of winning big, not as a hedge against downturns.

50 cent has also taken a bullet for every year Bitcoin has been in existence. Fact. Would you take a bullet for BTC? No, you wouldn’t. Definitely not 9. His infamous street beef with fellow Queens rapper Ja Rule actually stemmed from a vicious dispute over block size and tx fees. As a result he was stabbed in the abdomen at a NYC nightclub but was determined to survive to hodl another day.

The project hasn’t changed since this dip. If you believed you should continue to believe because no fundamental facts have changed. The market is correcting as it always has and those who keep a steady hand and hodl will always be rewarded. If you want to feel better look at the 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year charts. Continue to research and build on your understanding that lead to you believing in the project in the first place. You haven’t lost anything if you still have your coin. This isn’t the end of the story, at best a paragraph in a chapter.

I’m a little of drunk right now it’s well past 5p EST on a Fri so I don’t mean to sound dramatic but if my worst fears about Tether come true the implosion will set crypto back worse than MT Gox did. I almost feel like if we don’t let as many people as possible know not to buy it, not to use it, and actively discourage people who continue to do so we’re complicit and are all going to lose a shit ton of money (and credibility) from the fallout. 
USDT is not backed by 1.8 Billion in USD reserves. If so, prove it. What would be the harm in that? It’s not backed by anywhere near the equivalent USD and if it was there would be no guarantee/safeguard to keep it there anyway. I genuinely hope I’m wrong.

If you think we’re addicted to this shit refreshing Blockfolio 200x a day The Koreans are fcking obsessed. It’s been reported that up to 1/3 Koreans trade crypto. The horse is out of the barn, even if they do ban it S.Koreans will travel to Japan or Hong Kong to set up accounts or use VPN’s to circumvent restrictions. Chinese and decentralized exchanges will flourish. S Koreans are a tech savvy people and will go to great lengths to continue trading. A ban is unlikely imo, central government just wants their tax $.

1. If you haven’t sold you haven’t lost anything 
2. Why would you invest your whole college fund?
3. While I def have sympathy, those who invest amounts that if lost will ruin their life almost deserve to lose it because it’s so reckless.  
I hate reading stories like this. I hope you hold and see this through. Again, if you haven’t sold you’ve lost nothing yet. Be patient, zoom out, and take the long view.

NYCBitcoin.com seems like a way better domain name anyway. Not sure if it’s taken/for sale but I’d rather have 25 ETH or 2.4 BTC than either domain. 
Reminds me of that low cap bagel company stock that changed their name to Blockchain Bagel for a day and went 25x or something ridiculous. I heard SEC is looking into that btw, the bagel company wasn’t the first or last to play that game. My question is who is stupid enough to buy something so transparently fraudulent. 
Edit: tens of thousands of people were into BitConnnnnnnnneck at one point so that answers my last question. Tether is next but that’s another story

Because even tho it’s gradual it’s a ban. I would venture to say most large scale mining operations currently exist in China. The reason it’s only a small dip and not a crash is because if China doesn’t want mining many other countries/regions are more than happy to fill that demand. ESP eastern bloc, former Soviet states with dirt cheap electricity. 
This ban also raises the specter of increased PRC regulations on crypto. Should crypto threaten the RMB or PRC economic/social control they will not hesitate to ban exchanges, retail purchases, etc. but doesn’t seem likely at this point.

No. Wait it out and enjoy the ride. It’s $200. If you lose it you’ll be ok. But you won’t. Don’t try to time the market, buy and hold and you’ll see gains over time. 
Note: just my advice, others have different approaches. Some can time and beat the market consistently. Others benefit from long term holding and increasing your total investment incrementally over time.

When will a free P2P app be developed that will allow each individual to instantly transfer Bitcoin to one another, convert to USD in real time and vice versa, with low fees and it be accepted as a form of payment by both major and small retailers? I️ live a few minutes from MIT and Harvard and wonder if there’s someone writing the code atm for a true game changer.

There are problems (esp in U.S, see: Casascius BTC coins) but the benefits are complete anonymity, no record for taxation in private transactions, and lets face it 99.9% of the world understands money to be paper (with electronic debit/credit card transactions representing that paper). People like to be able to hold their money, count it, roll it up and snort things with it. 
I see a use for this kind of thing. It could increase adoption and understanding.

Local Bitcoins has a good reputation from what I’ve read but as always DYOR. I also wouldn’t advise selling more than a few at a time to reduce risk and also dollar cost average the sales. OTC (over the counter) agencies/firms exist in most major cities in some form. If you’re really a millionaire you should have the resources to locate these entities. I would also seek out a tax attorney perhaps one with experience in crypto or at least high level finance to see which trades/holdings fall under long term capital gains (lower rate) vs the standard percentage as well as other tactics 1%ers use to lessen their overall tax burden.

People bought up to 20k bc of fomo and hype. No one knows if BTC will go to 10k or 1k in the next 6 months. I personally believe we'll see new ATHs in 2020, but nothing as drastically high as you outlined. 
What's really needed is a Coinbase debit card. When people can be paid in crypto via direct deposit, purchase everyday items like coffee with crypto in seconds, send money P2P with ease and trust, that would justify an ATH price. I'm thinking of a card that's connected to the app and allows you to hold and spend BTC, ETH, USDC, and switch between them with ease. When every merchant accepts it, average people recognize and collectively agree that it has value, and you can transact as easily as using your bank card we'll see prices that reflect that value. Long term I am optimistic on Bitcoin, it's not going anywhere. That in itself is a huge accomplishment. The expermient has succeeded but there's still so much work that needs to be done with adoption and scaling.
