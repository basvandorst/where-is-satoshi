Well said, friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:49:19


Jesus fucking christ, man. And this is coming from a liberal lmao.
I don't think this sub/market is the place for you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:53:05
Ah, thank you!! That makes sense. At the very least, thank you for your help there!
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:08:43
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:10:25
Thank you! Hope this helped some other newbie out haha

You got unlucky, but the only solution is to HODL
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:57:38
Ah, misread, my bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:12:55
Makes sense. Next dip I’ll see what I can liquify. I already own a quarter of a litecoin, but like others have said I definitely see more potential for it in the future; I can envision a situation where LTC is currency while BTC is the value standard.

My coworker impulse grabbed .1 BTC right at the peak. I’m sure she’s just peachy today. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:58
Hell, so did I. Nothing we can do but hold through!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:52
Forreal, 15k or no deal
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:53
Hell, some people ITT bought at it somehow. Good old Spectrum...

Can't tell if you're referencing Freak Nasty intentionally but I'm just going to go ahead and assume you are.
I PUT MY HAND UP ON YO HIP
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:49
That was insane. By the time my Coinbase app loaded after the alert that it broke under 15k, it was already back up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:08
Every time I'm about to hit buy at ~17k, I think about this and reconsider... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:27:49
Yes it definitely is, I'll take yours off your hands for the cheap if you'd like!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:59:38
I may be biased as I bought in recently, but I can’t imagine this thing dipping to $200. $5k makes more sense to me; 1/4 versus 1/100 computes much better for me, but who the fuck am I to guess.

From an extreme newbie... how does one find the address in a form other than the QR code?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:15:59
Sell half, play with the house’s money!
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:09:48
Thank you, internet friend!! I’ll pay it forward one day ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:43:07
A lil bit of BTC is on its way out of GDAX to Poloniex, transfer pending... and now we wait.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:02:50
If it’s a reasonable time of day for coffee, I really don’t think it’s a reasonable time for blow...
...unless you work in the tech sector, like me. In which case, carry on. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:47:08
I’d like to hear thoughts as well... heavily considering turning half of my BTC into LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:32
It's sad that a crypto that just dropped over 3k in a day is less stressful than r/politics, but that's why I'm here!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:27
This just seems like the most blatant pump and dump possible
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:42:30
How exactly is the world’s first fully decentralized currency anti-globalist?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:27:05
Bought in at $16k and I’m thankful as hell that I listened when everyone said “don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose”
