you are speculating if you are holding bitcoin in the hopes it will go up in value
you are not speculating if you are ignoring the price fluctuations of bitcoin

That's not how bitcoin works.
If you can't find the address through a google search, then the business wants to be secret and it's be hard trying to figure out who owns the address.

There is no law banning Bitcoin.
Furthermore there are three branches of the Federal government.
The Executive is treating Bitcoin like money, the Judicial is treating Bitcoin like money. The legislature can still ban it.

Not true. At all. The market has to absorb the volatility from hoarders who own dozens or hundreds of Bitcoin.

Or thousands of gigabytes per year.

You can introduce more money into bitcoin.
Rewrite the code.
@_date: 2014-12-21 06:31:25
No. You only have to hash the block once, and the block header includes the merkle root of it. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:22:50

Bitcoin is meant to be trustless.
So, only big banks and big cloud computers would be able to host the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:31:31
but where does the tubes come in?
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:18:48
Right now hundreds of thousands of bitcoins flow through the network, or a thousand bitcoins per block.
However network security is currently only maintained by ~25.5 bitcoins per block.

there is no cost for miners to commit transactions to the block chain, which is why there's an artificial cap as opposed to a market mechanic.

Instead of paying wall street businessmen, their butlers, and their trophy wives; we are paying IT personnel, engineers, and coal miners.

Actually in the 5 milliseconds it takes to broadcast a block, some other block could be orphaned.

No they haven't. Unless you're talking about federal reserve officials, who aren't praising it either. They just believe it's viable.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:28:54
Unfortunately Bitcoin devs do not know what they are doing when they keep reducing transaction fees even though miner income is no where near 50 bitcoins.

The fact that many of the exchanges literally were created in the same way that most silicon start-ups were, and still function in the same way that most silicon start-ups were is pretty bad.

bitcoin devs are lowering the standard transaction fee

I don't think I ever said it before, but many people are aware of the concept. Besides, once you complete a block, you have an advantage as a pool, that you can immediately start mining the new block.

If you ask any economist, they would say my logic is sound. Besides, what I have written isn't about adopting Bitcoin. Enough has been written on why people should adopt Bitcoin. There are plenty good and bad reasons on adopting Bitcoin.
I'm just saying, the fact that Bitcoin can be copy-pasted, that isn't a real reason.

All bitcoin clients are capable of keeping a ledger. It's inherent to the blockchain that all transactions are kept and publicized.
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:35:20
there is no transfer history in the wallet.
it exists in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:56:33
Only for pool mining.
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:24:06
In the future, only governments or large corporations will be able to run full Bitcoin clients as the block chain approaches 1 petabyte in size.
Thus reaching ironies of epic proportions as people scramble to create a distributed storage blockchain network.

If there were multiple exchanges, then people could make money off of minute differences in each exchange's bitcoin price using scripts to do so.
Besides, centralization is inevitable on the internet. The fact that the internet is one large public place, as opposed to a thousand geographic locations miles away from each other, means that it would be easier to simply have Mt. Gox.

That'd only be true if they stockpiled bitcoin in the first place.
If they sold all their bitcoin, and changed the rules to make more, then it'd be a different story.

No. Say the collective hashing power increases by 10,000x. Only 100x more coins would be produced. In real economies, there are declining returns to output.

Not really, a good third of the Bitcoin money supply is lost.
Right now the velocity of Bitcoins is around 100,000x. The velocity of the US dollar is typically between 1.5x to 4x. If Bitcoin was to be used as a currency, instead of a more elaborate version of debit cards, Bitcoin prices will easily increase by about 10,000x, even accounting for a doubling of the Bitcoin monetary supply and no further increases in the value of Bitcoin purchases.

The Bitcoin protocol will likely be changed by the major mining pools to allow for a greater mining output by then.

The Bitcoin network isn't designed for mass usage. Just look at the transaction size.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:20:20
No. The price of bitcoins is the last sales price, which is the highest price people would pay for, and the lowest price people would sell for.
Thus if you sell bitcoins at 2000 dollars per coin, it won't sell and it won't affect the price, because it isn't the lowest price people would sell for.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:22:14
"The utility of a thing makes it a use value.[4] But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities."
"The change of form, C—M—C, by which the circulation of the material products of labour is brought about, requires that a given value in the shape of a commodity shall begin the process, and shall, also in the shape of a commodity, end it. The movement of the commodity is therefore a circuit."

You can manually transfer coins from one wallet to another by copy pasting, I believe.
Only transactions over the internet needs to be verified and added to the block chain.

@_date: 2013-11-22 23:39:29
No, difficulty increases 5x for every 10x increase in hashing power.
The block reward stays constant.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:18:41
No, the majority of the computing power that is mining needs to accept it. Once large corporations take over bitcoin mining, they'll do whatever.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:04:12
It doesn't. At all. If your computer is destroyed, you can lose your bitcoins. You could back up your wallet. And who knows which direction the value of Bitcoin will go. If China bans Bitcoins, the price will plummet. If some country pegs their currency to the bitcoin, it will skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:28:37
People do realize this is all guessing, since Bitcoin can be banned, attacked (the NSA controls the internet BTW), or even replaced?
