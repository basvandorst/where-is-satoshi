Are we looking at different charts?
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:14:41
September has come and gone.
Price is at 300.


[For posterity](
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:22:39
Enjoy your tiny claim.
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:49:51


Obviously not if I'm asking.












Therefore, he says


So I'll ask again:
@_date: 2014-09-21 05:59:46
How do you figure?
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:48:22
Don't worry; I dont take the majority of posts here seriously.
@_date: 2014-04-12 03:57:56
So if something is in its infancy and has a bunch of issues then its destined to do as well as the internet?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:06:24


What does this even mean?


@_date: 2014-10-06 05:22:36


Buying now instead of a month ago gets you 66% more coins. You've costed yourself plenty of profit by going forward with your 'excellent buying opportunity'.
How are you defending that buying at 500 was a great opportunity when a month later it has dropped by 40%? Are you delusional?


Who said I didnt have a long term view? Did you read my second sentence? Even if you have a long term view a 500 dollar buy is awful when a 300 dollar buy was just around the corner.
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:19:30
Comparing the utility of Bitcoin to that of a computer and the internet? Are you insane?


So the answer is, 'yes.'
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:50:09


Still costs money.


So every advertisement which nets the company more money than the ad never costs anything?
This is the argument you're making.
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:26:12
Its the middle of September and the price has dropped even more.
Thats my point.
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:31:35
Anyone named flamingboard must be a piece of wood perpetually on fire.
I hope you can see how this argument doesnt work.
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:07:42


@_date: 2014-04-12 04:24:33


A 60% decrease in price is totally natural; it happens to everyone.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:23:35


Where does he say they are not good investments?
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:46:33


Of course you do. 
Ad space is limited and the space you use for your ad is space that couldnt be sold to somebody else, forgoing the revenue from a different advertiser - otherwise known as opportunity cost.
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:21:23
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:16:26
Are you defending that 500 dollars was an "excellent buying opportunity" when just over a month later it has dropped to 300 dollars - a 40% loss of value?
Even if bitcoin will reach 10 billion dollars a coin, 500 dollars a coin a month ago was a horrible buy when they could have been had right now for 300 dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:45:46

How about a reddit gold wager? If bitcoin isn't at 2500 by Sept I get 1 month and if it is you get 2 months. 
Unless you don't think bitcoin will reach the moon.

I'm just calling out a prediction that some guy thought merited a 'look how right I am' post 2 months ago.


You're delusional if you think this prediction could turn out to be correct.


@_date: 2014-10-04 02:20:10

I'm not sure why you people are having such a hard time understanding an incredibly basic economic concept.
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:42:38
Going through complicated steps to enjoy something like the internet is far different than doing so to make sure you can hold on to currency when you can just use real money.

I have a page of ad space available.
Someone offers 1000 dollars for it, which is the market price.
I say no, and put my own ad on it.
My ad that I just used cost me 1000 dollars.

Glad you agree with me that it's not. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:25:30
    &gt;price down to 400
    &gt;excellent buying opportunity
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:40:34


Then why say is the same? 
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:16:53
@_date: 2014-08-10 21:17:59




The graph grows exponentially yet 77 days later we're essentially at the same price and your response to this is to wait 20 days?
Are you telling me there is going be a 400% increase in the price in 20 days?
@_date: 2014-04-13 03:04:06




Pretty bad, actually.
Have you checked your astrological sign for any more investment guidance?
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:23:12


Do you think the buttcoiners were incorrect for laughing off that log scale?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:20:43


Saying something is 'an excellent buying opportunity' is implying a high degree of certainty - and you said this because of some trend line analysis. How's that working out for you?
At no point after your 'excellent buying opportunity', for at least 5 months now, would you have made money. The price isnt $560 and you're slightly wrong, the price is $179 and you're not even in the same zip code.
I really hope you're not making more price predictions, like the guy I originally posted about, while ignoring some god awful ones like $588.


Did I say you did?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:35:16
I'm saying an excellent buying opportunity is not one where the price doesnt exceed it in the subsequent 6 months - you're not even close. Buying at any time after your prediction would be a better buying opportunity than yours.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:25:09


Why did you original tweet not say anything about CHF/EUR?
Your original statement said 'Swiss Frank the worst investment of 2015'.
Just admit you saw a chart on CNBC, saw it was going down, and ran with your tweet without even attempting to understand anything besides how that chart compared to the Bitcoin price chart. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:11:34
Is today a better buying opportunity than August 10th? Yes.
Is today a better buying opportunity than August 10th by a large margin? Yes.
Has Bitcoin been higher than your excellent buying opportunity since? Not by any charts I see.
Do you have nothing to say in response to any of this besides some irrelevant $4 talk? I didnt say $4 was a bad opportunity nor am I even insulting Bitcoin. I'm just arguing that $588 on August 10th was clearly not an excellent buying opportunity. Maybe you're having trouble reading?
Keep making up arguments to fight against since you're wisely sprinting away from your hilariously incorrect statement.
TL;DR: August 10th was not an excellent buying opportunity as your trend line analysis said it would be.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:27:35


I thought this happened last time. Why is the price still crashing if crashing helps prevents crashing?


My sides are in orbit

@_date: 2015-01-14 19:30:38


If Bitcoin reaches 10 billion dollars than your excellent buying opportunity is still worse than at least the subsequent 5 months. I can buy 2.28x more bitcoin now than at your price suggestion.
You've almost had half a year and your 'excellent buying opportunity' is the high point.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:22:04


You posted this on August 10th.
Based on your usage of the trend line, you figured that Bitcoin was undervalued and should raise.
August 10th: 588 USD
January 14th: 179 USD
Had anyone listened to your 'excellent buying opportunity' they would have lost over 69% of their investment.
Further, if anyone had ignored your 'excellent buying opportunity' and purchased today, they could have purchased 228% more bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:51:08
What do you disagree with in my statement?
Your 'excellent buying opportunity': 1 Bitcoin for 588 USD
Buying now, 5 months later: 3.28 Bitcoins for 588 USD
Maybe you should get out of the price prediction game with all of your intense 'trend line' analysis.

What evidence do you have to support that whollyhemp's statistics were lies?


So because it's common for politicians to lie then whollyhemp's statistics must be bad!

@_date: 2015-10-01 05:17:32


Bitcoin's value has dropped by 63% in 21 months.
Holding on to my cash seems to be the safest bet as the Fed won't come anywhere close to devaluing my dollar by 63% in less than 2 years.

You're making opinions based in nothing but your own delusions.
If you had a good history of predictions it would help your case.


What facts have you put forth?
What was your methodology for coming up with your percentages?
How could anyone reasonably say the chance of bitcoin collapsing is the exact same as bitcoin taking over the world?
Your entire post is an opinion piece and your track record is good enough for me to say your proposed outcomes will be incorrect.
