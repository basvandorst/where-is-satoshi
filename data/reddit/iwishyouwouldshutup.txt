aww, you didnt bold anythign
this is what you claimed. read it slow: 


this is **my** counterexample:


where in your thick, empty skull did you think i claimed you said anything else? all you've managed to do is whine and bitch and mangle what ive said all along.

you **fucking retard**, the last argument we had, you did this. you make a claim, i shoot it down, then you go "hahahaha this was the -real- target"
You claimed this: &gt;The recent Mtgox break didn't demonstrate any weaknesses in bitcoin
That is demonstrably not true. I demonstrated it. You obviously didnt assert what i did, you contradicted it. Quit being **a fucking retard**
i went ahead and bolded the only things you seem capable of reading and understanding, so you can get proper pissed before you lose your ill-gotten gains, **you scummy prick**
@_date: 2011-06-22 14:39:09
then i'll whine about you. you should not misrepresent things , but call them as they are. bitcoins arent anonymous, and you admit it.  handwaving isnt going to fix the problems

dipshit, what you misrepresented is that your [collective] fuckingup with mountcocks didnt uncover problems in bitcoin. you're just trying to say that all is well, to keep your bitcoins high-priced for the greater fool. ** YOU ARE HOLDING THE BAG AND TOO FUCKING STUPID TO FIGURE IT OUT **

i explained that the pseudonymity problem was exposed with the whole mess. you handwaved it away, admitting it was a problem. then you bitched and moaned about me, so i'll handwave you away.

@_date: 2011-06-22 06:23:49
wrong, fucko
Every problem with mtcocks demonstrates one big problem with buttcoin: they are **pseudononymous**, not *anonymous*. Transactions can be traced from wallet to wallet; people are talking of reverse-boycotting individual coins [which can only happen if you know where they come from] and to do any transaction, someone has to reveal a public key. An anonymous system would have to allow one to prove a valid transaction without revealing either the sender or the receiver.
And you guys have have to reveal some public key to the network to make transactions. if that wasnt bad enough, public keys are -everywhere-. people are linking themselves to a wallet -- like stapling your hundred dollar bills to your shirtfront. Sure, with enough firepower, you'll keep the dollars, but everyone knows how much is there.
[  ] is the record of the donation address on the sidebar -- i know every address that deals with the ad-money begging. Granted, i dont give a shit about this account, but -someone- may. And i bet, having observed all the buttcoiners, i can find some address on some forum post, or some bragging facebook update, that donated. And also, bought a lil doobage.

has anyone mentioned that what mountcocks is trying to pass as force majeure, any of us would have been convicted of **gross negligence** for.
not that it matters, mountcocks has the dollars and the buttcoins and all we got is a chance to die in the snow

there's a term for this in cryptography: **pseudonymity**
all the transactions for any given wallet can be determined, given that all transactions are available. the only unknown is the wallet holder, many of whom announce themselves publicly. why this gets called anonymity baffles me: an anonymous transaction would ideally hide either source or destination. 
some people do the equivalent of stapling hundred-dollar bills to their shirt, while holding a machine gun to keep robbers at bay. people can still know how big yo roll is.

if i had any to sell, sure i'd take your money. but, i dont consider myself stupid enough to get involved with other people's criminal enterprise 
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:23:40
i dont know what there is, but i wouldnt be surprised if they decided the entire thing was a scam, or a conspiracy to organize a drug market, or what the fuck they may do. it has looked to me to be a ponzi scheme from the beginning. Not that everyone involved in it would be a crook, or criminally liable.
Think what you can do -now- with a bitcoin. you can buy dope, if the market is up. you can launder money. You can sell it to a greater fool. you can do some good, legal things as well, but the -vast- majority looks like this speculation scam, and i dont want to deal with it.
If it survives to be a viable currency, [with the volatility and security problems, i doubt it] and if it is useful, and if it doesnt make me vomit, then i might consider using it
Please be careful out there.

let me make sure i understand. One dude does a lot of brilliant work,  and it gets gangraped into a canonical commodity bubble : a commodity with less value than burning paper dollars, every dollar profit coming by passing the bag to someone else to hold, peddling poison, straight theft, or abusing children. Also, slim jims.
Its a shit currency, a joke of a commodity, and an abomination to any ethical person.
also, the double spending problem is solved when you make exchanges of things with value to you. if it is so easy to double-spend, that should tell you the value of your data lumps
Yes, my penis is small, and i have no patience for idiots, but i hate scam artists and havent any faith in either the gubbmint, or this cure.

similar to what? 
@_date: 2011-06-15 13:47:04


 
that was my initial claim. you haven't answered/explained away this charge


it's a fucking currency. you shouldnt be using it as a commodity. 


maybe if someone had a need for particular data [like records of who owed who money, then it would be valuable [oh wait, paypal does that]


i have faith in me. i can not be retarded with my cash. i cant have faith in people dealing in BTC, for i know they cavort in a seedy underworld of slimjims and cp


I'm Ben Bernake, AMA
i have more faith that my dollar will be worth a dollar all day long than i do that a bitcoin would hold its price for 30 minutes. Most people -need- this.
I also have faith that i can live and have privacy, through my own actions, without needing BTC. 


btw: cash is the same way, but safer when we dont set up speculative scams buying dollars with other dollars


thats retarded. your current situation is taking a solution to your boogeyman problems and trying to buy and sell it like bread or gold or tulip bulbs. Mostly like tulip bulbs, cause your market will crash. Holders of BTC will be holding the bag when others get rich, and wont even have pretty flowers.
**Next time you guys make a currency out of fiat, try not to speculate on it without a full pantry bought with your currency**
@_date: 2011-06-15 05:19:39


no contest


it is -believed- worth $140M. you cant do anything with it other than use it like a currency --- making it a shit commodity. only other believers value it. if someone tries to get a significant fraction of that $140 M out, it'll crash to nothing; everyone would flee it to save their perceived value. that makes it a shit currency -- you shouldnt treat a currency as a commodity anymore than the inverse
funny you didnt bother mentioning the current market that accepts BTC, and how nearly the entire economy is speculation, scams,  and blatant illegality


why did the double-spend problem need fixing? [hint : when you can effortlessly duplicate a commodity [data] then it hasnt any value]


the advantages of cash -are- its disadvantages. I can use it anonymously and untraceably, and it can be stolen just as well. BTC looks deflationary, but -when- the bubble breaks, that will be (possibly hyper-) inflation. 
All ive heard from you is the same talking points ive heard elsewhere **Anonymous! Untraceable! No Boogeyman central Bank!  Cash on your harddrive** -- these talking points arent necessarily advantages of anything.
BTC are dangerous tools, treated as flowers and candy 
@_date: 2011-06-23 03:14:15
i havent lived long enough to experience that. you have with yours.
listen, i dont want to be a bad guy. i want people to succeed at endeavours. unfortunately, this hasnt been it. I'd be surprised if anyone with money or btc in mtgox ever sees it again. IF you do, you'll crash that market getting it out.
people hear of that, and they'll never buy in to it. it looks like a awesome way to get scammed. that is, if you had a legitimate use for the damned things. What can you do, but buy a few doobies or some sitehosting, or sell the things to other people.
im not getting into a market that scary and that small. 
and if we really need it to fight the Man, then its time for a real revolution, not a digital plaything.
