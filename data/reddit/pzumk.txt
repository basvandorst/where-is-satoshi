Everyone needs to email their favorite websites and ask them about Bitcoin payment. I only did two so far but had 100% success.
Not sure if anyone uses these sites, but I asked qwertee.com and udidpremium.com. Qwertee was already working on it and UDIDpremium integrated it within 24 hours.

I bought 3 BTC when it hit $1000 and immediately plummed to like $300. Held on until it hit $900 where I sold 1 BTC and another 1.7 BTC when it hit $1500. Now I'm sitting on 0.3 BTC

You don't say 33 "eee-you-are" if you refer to 33 EUR. You write 33 uBTC (µBTC) but you probably say 33 micro bitcoin.
Also if you say 3 "bee-tee-see" do you mean "bee-tee-see" (btc) or "bee-tee-see" (BTC)

hold. HOLD. But if you really REALLY need to sell... HOLD!

I think it doesn't really matter where you buy it. I figured you can buy it everywhere of the site is legit. Mt.Gox seems to have much waiting time, bitstamp seems to be down right now? I bought my first 0.1 BTC on bitcoin.de because it's German like I am. (Turns out I'm only getting 0.0999 because of a fee... Dang it!)
You might want to read about all the different sites where you can buy and look what's the best for you. Bitcoin.de was the best for me because there's little waiting time, trusted users and I can literally pay with my debit card.
I hope this helps a little
Edit: also, if you have much comment karma you might want to check out or because the bot can give you BTC for karma. That's how I got my very first uBTC or mBTC, not sure what the exact value was

I don't really understand how one does use these satoshis when there's the transaction fee.
If I buy 0.0005 BTC and want to do a transaction of all of it I simply can't because there's at least a fee of 0.0001 leaving me with 0.0004 BTC
