Odds are the attacker only have 1 BFX key. But BitGo just went along with the withdrawals. I see on the P2SH stats page that 2 smaller chunks of money left P2SH before the large chunk left. It could be the attacker testing the waters with before going all in. He is probably as suprised as everyone else how much he was able to get away with.

It is incredibly low to go after bitcoin rather than Kim, if he starts using it for illegal purposes.
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:33:16
there is a good chance a chunk of nodes will be thrown of the network after a hardfork and nodes are already low. increasing blocksize limit incur further costs on nodes without really solving anything tbh. so it is a problem. in my opninion we need node incitivation again before we can start increasing blocksize limit. i say again, because at first nodes were using their cpus to get bitcoin which was a good incentive to run one. and for some reason i think the ln network can help us there.

One should probably follow that mild intrigue till the end, no matter what, worst case scenario, you learn something new. Thats how i got into bitcoin. If i hadnt followed the inital intrigue i wouldnt have the amount of bitcoin i have today. I would have passed the oppertunity to go out of my way to understand it before everyone else.

this sets us up for a moral hazard. just wait until the first people start losing their reversible keys to a hacker. he can trap them indefinitely. if people think their coins are safe, because they can reverse them, they wont protect them as well. so the key will fall into the wrong hands sooner or later anyway. it doesent solve anything.
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:39:00
If he is such an expert, why isnt he getting this moving along? Where is the initiative? Its easy to call on others to change things, for example bitcoin protocol devs, when they probably have pretty good process for development already. I mean i dont think Alaire makes it clear what the problem is. 
Take a look at this gem from the article when Allaire is challenged about his company..






Am i the only one who can see the irony here?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:19:32
This is good news. Asuming they are as open as BFX: Nevertheless, what went wrong? How can multisig adresses be drained of 119k btc literately instantly? Isnt there supposed to be some sort of limit before one of the parties stops signing transactions?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:27:55
Its hard to say wether that is the hackers adress. But it seems bitfinex adresses start with a 3.
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:54:43
The people who want to increase the blocksize Limit are the Ones who do not care about bitcoin. Who do not care about challenging the so called Fiat debt based system. They Just want bitcoin to Rise in value as fast as possible. They dont think about the future.

what works and what doesent work in crypto is hard to say. its not an excact science. in the pos will probably work. but wether it is better than pow i dont know. well, if you have alot of coins, are a developer and want control over the network then PoS will be right up your alley. the benefits of PoW is that its more decdntralized, where as when it comes to eth you know the foundation will have alot of the staking power and thus control.

It was an unconstructive tweet. Maybe he wants to make a blog post and start a humble discussion if he thinks there is a problem. To me it seems like he is upset and throws a tantrum like a kid would. Its unproductive.
Why are people talking about governance anyway? If you have an idea, make sure it gets heard. If someone doesent agree, dont get upset. You promote your idea, you show of your work, and if its good enough people will appreciate it. Some people will say there is a governance problem if their ideas and their work is not good enough, and not appreciated, but that doesent mean there is a governance problem. In fact you could argue the opposite is the case. Take a look at Ethereum where a contentious and destructive hardfork slipped through the network. Thats when we can talk about governance problem.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:33:01

And if they were it would be to another P2SH adress i assume.
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:58:36
I think the threat is being downplayed a little. I think representatives within the community are working hard to prevent a hardfork and have been doing it for some time. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:51:33
There will be transcripts of the meeting. How is that closed door, suspect, or worrying?

Non faith based opinion. Is there such a thing? An opinion is by definition faith based imo. Its an opinion. But thanks for your input.
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:03:01
Thats likely why they are doing it. ETH is supposed to fork to fix contracts i gather. PoS makes it much easier, especially when you consider that the devs likely have alot of coin so will be controlling much of the staking power. Its totalitarian, because you have to follow the devs because they make the code, but also because they decide now via staking which fork is valid.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:46:09

Also, this is what mtgox tried but it ended up with more losses because they were insolvent. Oh and Cough Cough Roger Ver said they were fine.
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:06:17
I think there is a real threat. And to be honest it has to happen. The community is split, and the only way forward seem to have Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin I Dont Even with a 2mb blocksize limit increase. They are so dumb.
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:00:35
Yes it was.
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:38:17
Miners being second chamber of governance. Well thats sort of the point. Miners shouldnt have all the power, niether should devs. Of course Vitalik is pursuing a different model with his project, where devs will have the power(PoS). And they will abuse it. Its 100% certain.
But when powers are separated like in bitcoin dialogue between miners and developers are neccesary. And meeting in person is the most effective means of communication. I dont see a problem here to be honest. And bitcoin is also ripe with whistleblowers, so if anything malicious were to manifest the whistleblowers will be all over it. Look how fast they killed the Craig Wright scam for example. There seems to be no reason for concern, although people will find a way anyway. It is amazing.
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:48:46

I dont think bad things will happen. If people see bitcoin as a safe haven during a financial crisis they will find a way to it. And people will find a way to help people find a way to it. My first thought was bitcoin inside the swift network or something like that. Homebanking with a bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:03:55
Ethereum is probably too unreliable for something like this. They may as well keep an internal ledger. It attracts more people to their platform also, if you can only trade it there.
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:27:15
To my knowledge there are no big blockers in bitcoin. There are some who want to increase blocksize limit 1mb. This seems to be the most prevailent idea. But thats not a big block. 2mb blocks are not big blocks. What is going on is someone wants to increase blocksize limit at all costs, and i think its a flawed idea. I dont think its that important. The SegWit proposal is simply gold. And i cant believe we are so close to getting it. The beauty of it is it increase capacity slowly and in a backwards compatible way, which is excactly what is needed. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:23:41
yes that was implied :) But thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:39:49
It may. But its a double edged sword. Regulation is not 100% good. So the status quo where the market seeks the solutions or suffer the consequences, and people have choice, is the superior approach imo.

Indeed. read this where i describe PoS resembling a dictatorship, and PoW resembles a democracy because the powers are separared. It is unlikely in PoW that developers will be miners, where as in PoS, and specifically when 80% of the coins are premined, the network will be in control of developers because they most likely will control most of the staking as well. This can lead to power abuse when a group of poeple control the code and the staking.

@_date: 2016-08-04 10:06:55
some people hack just to make a point. just to see if they can get away with it. what does game theory and real world experience say about the level of security a person is likely to apply to a key he thinks noone will steal?
i mean i believe the level of security in bitcoin is adequate. so thats not the problem. the problem is people dont apply it thoroughly. right? but how do you solve that? 
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:42:32
There is a chance segwit wont be secure enough to be deployed at all. But i commend the core devs for getting this far along. it is an important step in trying improve cryptocurrency and i really hope it works out.

@_date: 2016-04-09 08:29:31
From my perspective, it seems like a step back. But i am merely an end user.
I suppose there are some technical advantages that makes it worth considering? But i personally like that you quickly distinguish one adress from the other right now, by referring to the first few characters. When i look at an adress using the proposed scheme, my eyes.
Unless there is a significant benefit from changing adress format, i cannot support this. For people that need to give adress over phone. Send email, send text instead. Because changing the adres format although it may seem convenient for some use cases, its going to cause inconvenience as a whole. It does not seem worth it.

Well, when the oil price was dropping, they never turned off the production because they were hoping oil price would increase they basically ran at a deficit. Now, when it comes to oil, im not sure that is going to work. This is more likely to work with bitcoin which is arguably more deflationary.
@_date: 2016-04-04 14:25:18
The market decides the price and the safe blocksize limit. Right now the consensus is 1mb is safe. The market will determine the price for blockspace based on that, based on supply and demand. May be an increasase to as much as 4mb blocksize limit in the not too distant future, and that only means even more blockspace and arguably, at least until it fills up again, cheaper tx! :) But the protocol should never be shaped according to the price on fees. It should be shaped based on technical merit, you know what i mean? Supply and demand will take care of rest.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:07:41
Imo BitGo should have more safety measures in place. Why do they sign withdrawal of 119k btc without contacting BFX first? I think it defeats the purpose of multisig if you are just blindly going to do what the other key holder asks you.

@_date: 2016-08-01 20:10:07
I think people are talking about things which they shouldnt. Things which they dont understand. Having no qualifications other than a reddit user account means that you get no say in bitcoin development. The problem is, these insigicant people will not accept that. They feel like they get to decide because they have bought some bitcoin. Its worse than feminism. The sense of entitlement and level of inconsideration is unreal and its highly toxic.

the thing about alt coins is, the best way to store them is on the exchanges. Its just the most convenient. If you dont want to trade any more, just convert to bitcoin and withdraw to a established wallet. Thats just my 50 cents.
@_date: 2016-04-10 13:43:01
You can trade alt coins. But that takes long to learn and get good at. And its not for everyone. But how is that different from anything else?
@_date: 2016-04-14 20:32:39
Fee pressure should be a more than adequate measure for network use and demand. In fact, its better than measuring the raw amount of transactions since that number can be easily manipulated with the absence of fee pressure. Thats not an argument for fee pressure in itself, but i dont share your doom scenario simply because blocks are full. Blocks have been full for most of 2016, and price is still pointing up. Bitcoin is so cheap right now, you dont even know it.
@_date: 2016-04-21 05:34:52

We need to provide a service to people with our stickies. This thread is not a service but its a wall of text. New comers arent interested in wall of texts. They want to literately ask a question and get answer immediately. This is why i propose to replace this sticky with something along the line of "Weekly simple questions thread".

The only reason i can think of, that people think there is a problem, is because its simple to understand. Ie. But its like saying the earth is flat. Its easy to believe when you cant see its round. And there is a dedicated movement in bitcoin, trying to convince everyone that the earth is flat. And its redicolous, because they just repeat the same things over and over. There is no evidence, just a group of people saying the same things. It doesent make it true.

Bitcoin mining is like a school of fish. If a shark approaches they scatter and instantly clump together again. The school of fish being the individual miners and the shark being a mining pool turning malicious. Some people don't understand this because they can't see it. So from afar bitcoin mining looks like a single blob. But when you GET close enough you can see The individual miners. And they all act I  their best interest, they instincicvle move away from danger.

I trade a little, and i look at charts. And i sort of learned that when price spikes, it settles again. So my question is, is the network utilization really dropping? compared to what?

I think people are overreacting. Basically you have to compare Bitcoin with other crypto. And all crypto face the same issue as Bitcoin when it comes to throughput. Some coins are cheating, by increasing blocksize or lowering blocktime. But in the end they are not more scalable than BTC. A reason to be bullish on BTC is because it is leading the space when it comes to scalability. For example SegWit is just around the corner, and Lightning Network is likely going to be released for Bitcoin first.

Some people are afraid if blocksize limit isnt increased asap bitcoin will fail. Its mostly based on knee-jerk thinking imo.

Its not going too well tho.

Regardles, SegWit brings improvements and possibilities that was otherwise not possible. And i wonder what the implifications are of making ~4mb segwit blocks. It was done on the testnet, i wonder how trivially it can be done on mainnet. And what the cost would be. I dont think an attacker would be able to keep it up for long. So if thats the only concern regarding SegWit, i dont think there is much to be worried about.

I dont think miners are considering fees when they plan for the future. Its not prudent. The safe thing would be to base your operation on the block rewards and only count fees as a bonus. Fees likely wont amount to anything compared to 12.5BTC blockreward anyway. Maybe fees will double. But thats still nothing compared to block rewards. It would also be wasteful to try and increase fees per block by enabling blocks that are twice as big. Rather than letting fee pressure double each fee. Then you have same blocksize but twice the fees. Thats more economnical for miners, if thats your concern.

I agree. But chances of on-chain payments being able to compete with off-chain except for some niche use cases is very low imho. 
So probably within the next 12 months we are going to see someone fixing the problems Steam outlined here, but it will be a off-chain solution. There is alot of cultural bias in crypto against off-chain solutions due how bad paypal has fucked up in the past. But they kinda have a monopoly where as with bitcoin companies are much freeer i think to develop payment infrastructure, so you wont have the same issues we have with paypal since there will be more competition. And its basically just a matter of time until the paypal of bitcoin arrives - Square is already flirting with the idea judging from their bitcoin integration in their cash app, and that is whats going to be a game changer. Lets see.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:01:57
Its been kinda funny to watch bitcoin the past few days. When it breaks $10k it shoots straight to $11k. But then when it breaks down it shoots straight to $9k. Its almost as if the $10k - $11k range is lava.

At best in the short term. But keep in mind their post adresses more issues than the fees - And when you think about it, the fees are a non-issue because Steam is not the ones paying it - Except for refunds? But this was the underlying issue you see. On-chain payments are really bad for Steam and similar services and its a shame Bitpay didnt act. But honestly its their loss because someone else will figure out how to bridge the gap between Bitcoin users and merchants and that will just be the end of Bitpay.

I know in the end its all bitcoin, but in principle i think their decision makes sense. Bitcoin is not this we love each other wonderland.

I hate the fact that people make it an either or scenario, and i think they are fooling themselves by ignoring the possibilies that lie in off-chain transactions. In reality off.chain and blockchain goes hand in hand. Its an inverse pyramid with the blockchain at the bottom. In the end we are all going to be using off-chain services for our day to day bitcoin use. Because the blockchain simply cant compete with the flexibiliy, ease and speed of a proper off-chain service.

I'd say btc and fiat are equally safe. Btc has a gross speculative aspect to it, fiat is just garbage but it has network effect at least. Gold is sound but it has almost no network effect.

I think its wrong to raise the blocksize with the goal of keeping fees low, but its also wrong to keep it small, to let fees rise.
The real issue is that devs have to control blocksize, which makes bitcoin inadequate. Its not truly decentralized. What needs to be done, is to implement utilities for miners and nodes to establish a blocksize market, so that the blocksize issue can be dealt with in a decentralied matter, let the blocksize be as big or small as the network truly prefer and is capable of handling. In my opinion its the final piece of the puzzle, and its going to be difficult to develop. Because you need to make sure the system cannot be gamed, and that it cannot be used to attack and/or hurt bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-20 07:12:12
You dont want to use the blochain unles you have to. Its clunky. Raising the blocksize with the intention to keep fees low is wrong. What is important is the health of the network, and it can be healthy even with high fees. Argueably the blocksize needs to be raised for the network to remain healthy. But one could argue it would be healthier because more consideration will be put into what transactions are broadcast to the network. For everything else there is the off-chain services which are cheaper in theory and more flexible. Some time down the road when the off-chain market is improved, you wont go through the trouble of using the blockchain. is an example of a simple ofchain solution that makes it convenient to give each other even microscopic amounts of bitcoin. 100 bits

Here is how i see it. Please bear with me as i am not good in getting my point across.
If Gavin does as mike suggests, it will serve as a basis for how to do things in the future. May or may not work this time, but then what happens next time there is a disagreement? 
Haste is not an issue, since bitcoin is still an experiment. A multi billion one. But i would not advise to do Mikes approach under any circumstance. I think we should emrbace the debate, and the disagreements, and let them play out as long as neccesary. Because just because there is not consensus right now, doesent mean there never will be. We might need the blockchain to clog before consensus is reached. But we will reach it sooner or later. Just hold fast..

I think switching to 21mb seems reasonable. Its probably going to cause problems for alot of people come hardfork day/week, who knows how long the battle of the chains will draw out. But for long term sake i think its a good move and the 21mb chain will win.

Arguably fees will only be high when the theoretical jams occour. All you have to do to avoid the jam is a pay a fee that is high enough. The question remains wether or not you are willing to pay this fee. And that depens on a wide variety of factors tbh. In a sense the fees discourage traffic jams.

If you want to create a succesful sharing concept you need to think about what you are already sharing with your friends and family and give them an oppertunity to share it with strangers, in a safe way, i guess.

The blocksize shouldnt be used to control the value of transactions but to prevent flooding/spam and possibly make sure it doesent grow faster than its own good. I am just pointing out that off-chain transactions are not the enemy although it seems to be a popular belief around here.

Im not worried about that. Because in the end there is a limit to how big the blocks can be. In the end there may be more demand than what the blockchain can possibly handle. This is why its important to not ignore the role off-chain services can play in clearing some of the demand for bitcoin transactions.

I dont think intel will be interested in mining themselves. Only producing the chips and selling them on, thats their specialty. The market cap for bitcoin mining chips likely follow the value of the blockreward for an entire year. If they were to begin making mining chips i dont understand how that hurts their production in other areas. It wouldnt take resources from that. Intel is profitable and established its likely they have spare capital and resources for things like this. And if they dont they can have investors line up in a jiffy i bet.

Okay. A ban or severe restriction on bitcoin node operation, because money transmitter, could force nodes out of that particular country/region.

So we have jails, and people in government with nothing better to do than figure out what we can use them for. One of the things is patents. If someone has an idea they can submit it to the correct instance of government, pay a fee, and possibly get a monopoly on the idea. this means if anyone tries to do the same the government will do what they can to stop them, by fining them under threat of jail if they dont pay. Thats as far as i understood it.
With this in mind, are you saying that only money should not be able to be patented?

You find the most reputable exchange to use, sell and then have your cash sit with them and then buy back in later i presume. That being said in the past the exchange market was incredibly centralized. Today the bitcoin volume is spread out more.

And there is no need to explain the confirmation system if you want to demo bitcoin. A demo typically works something along the line you get your friend to create a wallet - typically on his phone - then you send him some bitcoin and the transaction propagates to his phone almost immidately. The confirmation system is just something that works in the background for all he knows. And just for record, bitcoin may be the future of money, but not necceasrily the future of money transacting. Blockchain is a crude system that is sound none the less, but clunky and awkward to use compared to for example paypal. Who is to say paypal wont invite bitcoin into their system. That would be a good day for anyone who owns bitcoin.

Good morning. I think its still prudent to push for SegWit adoption. Currently its around 30% so there is plenty of room to grow assuming people dont have to use the legacy format. 
Fees are not too bad right now so probably most people dont care, but there could be a surge in demand any time and at that point you will be glad if your wallet or favorite exchange support SegWit because it can save alot on fees, and the higher they get the more you save with SegWit :) So just wanted to get that off my chest. Have a nice day and happy trading or whatever it is you do :)

I dont understand you point. However the mining power is not technically being centralized, the pool operator does not have it under his direct control. Its an entirely voluntary situation, and given the ease at which to switch pool and the numerous other pools out there, miners withdrawing their consent and switching pool will be trivial in the event a pool operator tries to attack or manipulate the network. Due to the nature of the blockchain, miners and various other self-interested individuals can and will be watching for malicious activity and it will be spotted very fast.... :) I guess what im trying to say is, define centralized, because according to my definition that is not what is happening in the mining buisness because the miners are free to choose between several different pools, and its relatively easy to switch. So the individual pool operators dont have real authority over the hashing power.

Also its nice to see how government regulation makes things more expensive. Yea this guy aint cheap to have on staff, and that will be reflected in bitpays fee schedule. Probably nothing, compared to the amount of transactions they make, but its the straw that breaks the camels back. Right?
I know you dont get stuff, security and so on for free, but AML is a lame attempt to thwart criminal and terrorist activity. Its like bugging everyone, and burdening the entire society, just because there are a few bad apples. In reality the reason organised crime is so powerful is because of government intervention to begin with. War on Drugs for example makes the entire recreational drug market a lucrative buisness for them. Now they can extort, exert violence, you know criminal behavior and people cant go to the authorities because, well, its illegal. Makes sense?
What about the War on Terror, where they drop bombs, shoot civilisans basicially cause anarchy over seas, in order to... lol... reduce the amount of violence that happens domestically. Unfortunately its the violent interventions over seas that makes these poor people counter-attack. The entire situation is just sad, because they are so poor, and so easily taken advantage of they literately kill themselves to get back at the west and so on. Ok ramblings have gone on, long enough.

Fantastic. People say cryptocurrency cant be currency because you cant spend it. But obviously thats because the infrastructure isnt really here for that yet.
However i am very skeptical of this particular project.
1. The name is really bad. It reeks of incompetence.
2. i suspect this guy was head hunted for PR reasons (It was an ICO after all, an they have $52M. Pretty sure they can afford this guy)
3. In general ICOs have not really produced anything. For example most if not all the things people use today are not from ICO devs. And it will probably stay that way. And theres a good reason for that: ICOs dont make sense on a fundmental level so people who actually want to solve problems and have the skills to do so do not pursue an ICO model.

That was the way the proposal was designed. 95% of miners had to signal they was ready before nodes started enforcing the rules. Miners had a year to get ready, if they didnt, the proposal would deactivate and something else might have been tried. But there was much going on, because you had UASF forming after about 6 months (They argued miners werent getting ready for nefarious reasons) which was going to activate segwit regardless of how many miners was ready, and then you had SegWit2x which wanted to activate SegWit and then hardfork as well. It was a mess.

It is so wierd to me how the banks determine the inflation rate. What is the point of that? All they do is hide the underlying things at work in the economy. 
For example targeting inflation rate of 15% is what the argentinian government is doing. But why? The economy is like nature, it finds a way. There is no need to control it. So you might have 40% inflation one year but ultimately it stabilises if you just. keep. your. hands off it. And this stabilisation will be faster and sounder if there wasnt a central bank trying to play god by manipulating the money supply and what not...

That is such a logical fallacy. If the purpose of currency is to spend it, then currencies will be spent. It doesent matter if it rises or falls in value.
Except that a currency that rises in value will be preferred. So if you had the two existing side by side in the same economy  with the same level of adoption and infrastucture the currency that was falling in value would not be spent because nobody would accept it.

It's not only the competition aspect, it's the autonomous nature of mining and how that secures the network. If he wants miners to wait for an attack he is arguing for centralization, because someone needs to sit and watch the network and be ready to hit the button and fire up the miners. But who will do That?  Oh I know, let's form a government and tax everyone to finance this operation.  And there you go... centralization was just implemented :)

Ok. This also means there are alot of legit customers with amazon. Alot of customers that use credit cards and ship to adresses that do not match that adress. Therefor it is not a red flag when a credit card does not match the shipping adress.
You started by saying Circle likely dont have a fraction of the fraud detection Amazon have, and then you end up by saying they definately dont have. What fraud detection are you talking about? Do you need to provide a cell phone number, and verify it when signing up or checking out with amazon? Do you even think Amazon is aware of purse.io? Amazon delivers to physical adresses, therefor fraud on amazons platform itself is reduced, one would imagine. Oh blah blah one can fake adresses etc. But it doesent change the fact that fraud on amazon platform directly is inconvenenient. Purse.io changes this, you get your "fake" adress, you use the stolen CC, and you get your bitcoin. There is less risk if not work involved when using purse.io compared to using Circle

I wonder how much they make, and if they'd be willing to jeopadize that in order to seize control and start attacking the network. At least the network is growing at an exponential rate, and CEX.io would have to keep at the top of their game in order to keep their hashing share. Right now they have no competition afaik. 
But since gigahash.io is a no-fee pool, there is a good chance the majority of the hashing power in there is not from their own equipment (how big is the largest single entity owned mining center ?) ... Its likely a large portion of gigahash.io hashing power belongs to many different entities and not solely cex.oi

I dont think you understand the concept of decentralisation. Bitcoin is just bitcoin. And its being very good at it. You can send money anywhere, securely etc. The wallets, the exchanges, etc. are all infrastructure that needs to be built, its nothing to do with bitcoin per say. If anything there is not going to be a currency that will be easier to use, there will be a currency that has better infrstructure. But i dont see any reason why people should switch from building infrastructure for bitcoin, to for example doge, or another copy. We need something that is vastly better, but i dont see why if a good idea comes along, it cant be added to bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2014-07-18 06:46:05
I guess what you are saying is the reason bitcoin has had a shady past is because there lacks regulation.
What if regulation has prevented proper 'bitcoin' integration? What if the regulation aimed at the legacy banking system has been interferring with developing a proper bitcoin exchange. America is at the fore front of innovation. It is the american retailers that have jumped on board. This is because they have several payment processors such as bitpay or coinbase. But... There is still no american exchange. Dont you see this as an anomaly? I mean, to me its clear that something is wrong. And i want to bet that the reason there is no american exchange is because regulation is preventing it from being established. Instead we have to rely on exchanges in japan, slovakia etc. Because thats just where the loopholes are atm.
So if there hadnt been this regulation ya know, to begin with, bitcoin would be much healthier.
Now. the proposed regulation may clear up some things and allow some wealthy people to establish a functional bitcoin exchange but thats not what i want. I want bitcoin to be free, i want anyone to be able to make their bitcoin exchange and then have people choose them or not. I know it sounds a bit silly, but i believe that is the way we obtain the growth and prosperity etc..

Bitcoin doesent need marketing. It sells itself. Poor products need marketing, i dont know if you agree.
Nevertheless marketing helps a poor product and a good product for that matter, but it is not definitive to a good products success. Not a product like bitcoin which is -- permanent -- It doesent degrade with time, there is no expiry date etc. There is no rush.
Now, just as a side note, you used the term "we" a couple times. What do you mean by that? Who are you? Who is 'we'?
anyway. It is difficult working with the on and of ramps for that matter into bitcoin due to heavy banking legislation. And the banks approach to the currency and buisnesses involved with it - Again due to banking legislation -. Making a bitcoin wallet is "easy" there are no regulations, yet, thats why you have several very good options. When it comes to exchanges, actually there are a few solid ones, i guess the common objection is you need to do bank transfers, and simply cannot put in your credit card information like you are use to so many other places. Again this is the nature of bitcoin and the traditional banking system. Bitcoin is a push system, whereas traditional banking is pull to a large degree. Basicially this can be used against people who sell bitcoin, which ends up costing them money, if they become victim to charge back fraud, and since you can basicially do it wit hany stolen credit card, the risk is signficant. Further more you have the legislation you need to comply with. Its complex. Its expensive to comply. That keeps people from building on ramps. That is all.

Bitpay already significantly cut cost for their products because they realised they dont need that much money in order to be profitable. It could very well be the same with coinbase etc. Once they are established, and there even is more competition, fees could become none existent. Of course this largely depends on government intervention as regulation has a habit of racking up costs significantly.

What are you comparing bitcoin to in this case? It costs money to have a bank account it cost money to have a credit card. It even cost money to use it and you have to be of certain age and status, and there are usually significant fees involved. So i dont buy the argument that bitcoin is more expensive and less practical in the long run

What is a mining monopoly? The only way a mining monopoly could happen is if the government began enforcing one. For example cracked down on mining pools, except 1. The other way is if a mining pool was really freaking good. Blowing the competition away. And thats where were recently. GHash.IO was better than any other pool, especially for the larger players. But thats not really a monopoly. They cant do what they want. They still have to be honest, otherwise they will bleed miners to the competition.

Bitcoin was designed around incentives, it is the most effective way to shape humam behavior. If you know of another, please report in. At least one that is possible via software. Thats why i said bitcoin was designed so no human being could control 51% hashing rate. First of all, as the difficulty rises and the total hashing rate grows it gets harder and harder for a single entity to control 51% of the hashing rate 100%. A pool operator does not control the hashing power 100%. His control is based on trust, and if he abuses it, he is gone.

If you care about saving look into bitcoin. Bitcoins have been increasing in value since they were created. I think they first traded at about 50 cents. Now its over 600 dollars. 
When it comes to the dollar, it has been consistently loosing value. I think during the span of a single generation prices have quadroubled, and the rate at which  the dollar decreases in value, making prices denominated in dollars increase even more.
So if you care about saving, look into bitcoin

Its the whole idea that doesent scale. You need 3rd party layers on top and off chain transactions to be able to accomodate any significant amount of economic activity... But maybe the blockchain is enough to secure a digital commodity and then the market will build infrastructure on top it, off chain transactions and so on. But the blockchain will probably never be able to handle significant amount of activity

Not lost forever. People will be in the 2nd or 3rd time they hear about bitcoin. I thought it was too complicated when i first heard about it and wanted some. Of course, it was a little complicated, but when i heard about it again a year or so later, it was still complicated but much less, this was beginning of 2013 btw. But i didnt care. I wanted some. And i paid 10% fee sometime. I dont care about that today. What is $80+10%? Not even close to the current exchange rate. Anyway today its much less complicated than beginning of 2013. Imagine how it will be in a year or two. Thats why i said to my friend when he said he didnt want to bother because it was too complicated. So i told him well thats why you have to buy now, when it gets easy the price will be much higher. He is in. Unfortunately we bought at $665

There is a ledger that keeps track of all bitcoins. This ledger is called the blockchain. Everytime you send bitcoin to someone, the miners put the transaction into a block, and attaches it to the previous block. Hence the name blockchain. But its a ledger, really. Everytime a miner 'finds' or creates a new block, he is rewarded with 25 newly created bitcoin. This means you have to be a miner, and you have to have enough hashing power to produce blocks in order to get freshly minted bitcoin or 'poof' them into existence as you said.

I am actually fond of pooling. If miners couldnt pool, it would be hard for smaller guys to get any of the block reward. Therefore if miners couldnt pool, the network would likely be smaller and grow slower. There might be too little competition in mining pool land, but these things tend to work themselves out over time. After all, if Ghash decides to do any shenanigans that makes the competition look better

Volatility can become a problem for a company like paypal, if it turns out 80% of its bitcoin users, lost money, because they bought high and sold low. It could become a PR mess. Not that paypal is at fault, they simply enable the SHEEPLE to buy bitcoin, but twhen the SHEEPLE makes a mistake they usually like to blame others. At least thats what im thinking. 
If i was paypal, i would be very reluctant in enabling a bitcoin purchase option, because the value can go north and south any time. I know there are financial instruments that can reduce volatily but im no expert in this area.

The risk of 51% attack will always be there.. If you change PoW it may even increase, or you may get a non-signicant reduction.

Its almost impossible to enrich yourself in any significant matter by screwing with the blockchain via hashing power, so your island scenario does not hold. When it comes to a wallet or an exchange holding millions worth of bitcoin then it is a real concern. When it comes to mining, realistically you can at most disrupt bitcoin, but only temporarily
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:12:29
It is a common misconception only newbies mine at GHash.IO. I think it has some newbies, but a majority of the hashing power comes from the big players on the market. For example Petamine is mining with GHash.IO they have more than 1 PH of mining power afaik. The reason the large and more serious players prefer GHash.IO is because they just offer the best solution. Its a nicely run pool, with several merge mining options (makes a considerable difference if you have alot of TH), competitive uptime, no fee etc. Ghash is a highly competitive pool, and unless the competition catches up Ghash will continue to enjoy a significant portion of the hashing power.

I honestly dont know what you are talking about. If a single entity is to control 51% of the hashing power, and use it for malicious activity, there is no real way to stop them. Other than criminal prosecution, im sure it could warant an investegitation. Anyway. A pool does not control 100% the hashing power miners allocate to them. If the pool stops behaving honstly, the miners will leave for an honest pool. And the problem will solve itself. Youd have to pull of a double spend in a magnitude of millions USD worth before you will notice anything on the markets. And this is not going to happen imo, because when so much money is on the line, there is going to be alot verification involved imo. Waiting for confirmations etc. You understand? :)

The argument regarding 51% attack. Keiser mentions the bitcoin network relies on incentives that someone does not commit bitcoin suicide. Well, i guess the reason he mentions it, is because some people (Ver perhaps) give the impression that bitcoin is indestructible.
But i just like to mention that everything we do in life depends on someone NOT killing us. Basically. Right? We rely on the incentives. For example getting on board a plane you rely on the pilot not crashing it, and we can rely on he wont because he has little incentive to. Getting in board on bitcoin you also rely on miners not colluding to commit bitcoin-suicide. Its not a real concern tho. Since there is little incentive for a miner to do so

Ethereum is essentially just a share in the founders company. There is no official entity so it looks decentralised,  but everyone knows when you buy eth you are buying into Vitalik's and Joe lubins ability to pump the value of it.

Not really. Bitcoin network is built on consensus so you may have all the money in the world to sway opinion and development but in the end if the "people" don't agree your money is worthless.
When it comes to government that's a different story since the relationship between it and the people is not voluntary. In this case if you have money you can sway lawmakers, regulators etc. for favorable legislation, and what is the people going to do?

To be honest i dont think shares or etfs are any less risky than bitcoin considering its been almost 8 years since last huge drop on the stock market. These things tend to come every 8 years or so. So id not want to  have any shares right about now, you can also see the stock markets are up hugely since 2007/2008 when the financial crisis really broke out. I could be wrong, but if you look at the fundamentals of the world economy things are not looking bright. This is about protecting your wealth not growing it, and i think shares are risky.

Yes that is voluntary, you choose the way in which you earn your living. Some are better than others. Some are more successful than others.

I am sure mining would evolve into conglomorates even if it was GPU, or CPU. If there is money to be earned, someone will build big fucking farms, and even, possibly develop custom GPU or CPU that are cheap, but really good at bitcoin mining. Other than that, yes, right now, Miners have to sell their bitcoin, or at least a portion of it to cover certain expenses. This can change, as mining becomes a bigger industry, and as it does, bitcoin becomes more 'valuable'. Imagine the first power generating company accepting bitcoin, miners wont have to sell as much BTC. And so on.....

How often do you use this 'service'? I found i have never needed it, because the protections are already in place, with ebay and amazon for example with their repuation system and what not. Also you have trustpilot which is very widely used where im from. So i dont need the bank to have that kind of control of my money, because i already know im dealing with good guys.


Certainly there is a learning curve involved with using bitcoin, but this is getting smaller and smaller as time go by. Circle is the latest addition, it seems, which seems to make it even easier and more "dumbed down" to buy and use bitcoin.


Yes in most cases you have to wait for 1 confirmation for your payment to be accepted. In some cases this is annoying, for example if you want something instantly, for example a game, or deposit money to a poker account or whatever. But in other cases, for example when ordering goods, its not such a big deal. However there is no saying bitcoin will not be compatible with paypal etc. etc. There is absolutely nothing as far as i can see that stand in the way of integreating bitcoin alongside and in the same infrastructure as dollars currently is. Off-chain and instant transactions, even reversible. So on.


Yes. When it all comes down to it bitcoin is a speculative instrument as of now. And im sure most people who have come along so far have profited. Every rally some new people are lured in because it makes headlines. But then they end up buying near the all time high because they dont know better. But hold bitcoin, i mean, the longer you hold it, the more it will reward you, at least thats what history shows.. And thats it real appeal right now, apart from being able to buy quality drugs from reputable vendors. This is a big deal to some. I dont really care, although i think its interesting.
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:47:48
Thats like saying if someone is really good at something, and they obtain great success. Thats a tragedy of the commons because now he has such a large market share he can dictate prices and poop on everyone. But that is an economic fallacy. In the event a succesful person or entity uses its position to do bad, they will suffer most themselves in the end. For example ghash.io is currently the best mining pool because among other things they dont manipulate the blockchain. Meaning they dont double spend, they dont 51% attack and so on. If they start this it will be the beginning of the end for themselves not bitcoin or the miners at all, they just switch pools.

Nervous is the way i would describe it. There is relatively little volume. The december rally, some exchanges had almost 100k BTC traded in average in 24 hours. So when volume is low but volatility is high, that means a nervious market imo. It could be a few whales just playing around.

This is probably a bad idea. You should get them to hold their own coin as fast as possible. If you are worried they will mess up, they probably shouldnt have any yet.

I think you are making stuff up. Part of being a currency is being a medium of exchange is a sentance that does not make sense. Bitcoin is speculative at the moment but it has all the things that qualify it to be used as money. The price discovery is far from over because it is so new, and the fluctuations in price are caused deep down by government regulations because they make it hard for genuine exchanges to establish themselves. However we are entering a period with more reliable exchanges than ever, vault of satoshi, bitstamp, kraken, and even btc-e, plus everything thats happening in the foreign scene, china etc.
What im saying is you need to look at the bigger picture, fluctuations are a given since bitcoin is speculative atm. but it has all the qualifications to be used as money. I wouldnt disqualify it yet.

People who buy in in 2014 can still be considered early adopters. Nothing fundamental has changed since 2009. Bitcoin is still bitcoin, it still holds a promise, and there is a good chance people will be able to deliver. I dont know when people can no longer be considered early adopters. Possibly if/when it becomes a unit of account.
I agree that the speculators dont do much in order to improve the bitcoin ecosystem, but many others are.

When entrepenours and investors are looking what to spend their time and money on they look at the regulatiory environment among other things. The less clear or the more regulation there is, the less incentive they have to work in that specific area. Thats why proffesionals have been avoiding bitcoin. Mtgox was working fine before the US government hit them on the head, and what was the point?
You originally mentioned bitcoin transactions should be restricted and monitored where possible, otherwise criminals would use it to launder drug money. Thats not to say they will find a way to use bitcoin anyway. But we did agree the reason criminals have so much drug money is because of prohibition and the war on drugs. So you can solve the problem of powerful criminal gangs, avoid the the whack a mole strategy in regulating and as a result hindering competition with all the consequences that encompases in the payment and finance industry, basically limping concepts like bitcoin, by ending the war on drugs.

Sounds good and all. But the problem is we are not using the proper language/words when speak. It allows for these shills to get away with stuff they shouldnt.
So the problem is not centralization, since that can mean a load of things. It is not very specific. Therefor the solution cannot be to decentralize since that could mean alot of things as well, it is not very specific.
However, what Lawsky is doing is comming up with rules which he can enforce with violence, or threats of violence. This is what needs to be stopped. Or done away with. You cannot have a group of people in society who can legitimately iniate force against others in attempt to solve an economic or social problem. Because you cannot solve a problem by making rules against it. Right? You cannot write things on a piece of paper and have anyone who doesent abide, be fined or thrown in jail. Things dont work that way.
However you can protect your own interests, as a big company, or industry, for example the financial industry which as far as i know is pretty much in control of a few people anyway..... They can use the 'government' to protect their own interest. They can use the governments power to initate violence against others, in order to further their own agenda. And this is what goes wrong time and time again i believe. And unfortunately Ben Lawsky or the government, very few people in fact makes this any clear.

Yea but its a hassle to do it on purse.io. You have to find an amazon order that matches the amount you want to buy, at an exchange rate you are comfortable with and you have to 'gamble' the guy will pay your BTC after he recieves the items. Usually it takes days before the BTC is released, which is counter-intutite to the credit card approach. Might as well get registered on an exchange and do normal bank transfer then, that is just as fast.

And the reason bitcoin is hard to buy is because people or large established platforms are reluctant to get into the arena, because of bitcoins volatility and the mess they could have on their hands, if turns out another rally ends up costing alot of new people money. You know what im saying?
That being said, bitcoin still has potential, for example as prize money in  online tournaments. I think gamers are going to be the next big group, after libartarians and anarcho-capitalists to adopt bitcoin.

SegWit2x was Jeff Garziks mess and miners hopefully knew what they got themselves into with that piece of crap. Im glad they didnt even try activating it because it would have been a disaster. First of all it had a bug that would freeze the chain, second of all it was contentious so it would have split the network.. Last but not least it was announced out of the blue without any public discussion and they were working on it up until activation instead of finishing it and then proposing it, total amateurs. So yea i dont understand your frustration. You should be glad it didnt activate.

This method have been tried and failed. The bitcoin foundation reached out to regulators and what not mid 2013, via a several day meet and greet. All they got was a head start in trying to regulate bitcoin, a headstart that we really could have been without. If the internet got regulated in its early days or if there was a heavy political presence trying to shape it, its not likely it would be as developed as it is today.

You are wrong. It makes it easier. The barrier to entry, if this regulation is passed, is going to be enourmous. The market cannot weed out the competent from the less competent.

Wow i really didnt expect you would be this ignorant. However, i got to apologize, i didnt mean to call you ignorant. But we dont know the amount of hashing power cex.io owns, compared to 3rd party miners. Admitteldly if gigahash.io is 100% CEX.io there is a little reason to be worried, but i can guarantee you its not. Even if it is, CEX.io would be giving up their current successfull buisness in order to shut down bitcoin. Someone estimated somewhere they were selling contracts for 1 btc that would only ever mine 0.5. 
Anyway, you keep using words such as hope and we cant do this and that. What do you propose?
I on the other hand will argue the situation is not as bad as you think. Gigahash.io is still a mining pool and because of that they cant effectively do a 51% attack
The whole ordeal is just temporary, either until people figure out the mining contracts is not worth it, or there are more competitors on the market.

The blockchain just makes bitcoin sound. It doesent need to accomodate world trade. Take a look at the dollar, which despite its fundamental flaws, ie. not being sound, it still works pretty good as a digital currency. There are alot of fees involved i hear, when doing online transactions, but that can be sorted out if there is more competition, and this is something bitcoin can bring. 3rd party payment processors who offer payment off the blockchain will be a very competitive space i imagine. Its going to make bitcoin scale indefinitely* as well as offer reasonable fees(likely cheaper than the blockchain tx fee now..)..
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:50:22
The thing is you are throwing around alot of words and dont have a thorough understanding of for example government. Its true that not everyone is independent, but its not true that anarchy will be a society without rules. Im sure you and your significant other have agreed upon some rules.... However you dont agree to punish each other in the event the other person does not live up to them. Or at least punish each other physically, right? I mean, thats the gist of "modern" thinking and social science. That you need someone with the ability to punish others, threaten them with violence if they dont obey the rules, which co-incidentally is forced upon each individual. You dont agree to abide by the new rules the government makes, you are forced to follow them, or go to jail or worse....
Anyway. There will be rules in the absence of traditional government, you just have to look around you today where people make agreements and solve problems without the threat or use of violence, which is only what "modern" government does. And that is the entire problem. Because not everyone is honest. Or rational or caring etc. That is why modern/traditional government will fail in the end. Through time the bad actors will have influenced society via government regulation, rule and law, that society crumbles in the end. Why do great civilisations die? Well they are destroyed from within, via government, over time

Basicially they use their dominance, threats of prison, to intimidate people into complying. If they had to go after everything the hard way, the system wouldnt work, so i guess you are correct. However something i believe that is often overlooked is the power of the culture. For example you can get attacked for speaking the truth, ie. pointing out that the state has guns, its based on violence etc. And this is beneficial to the state. It doesent have any laws or rules stating you must attack people who tell the truth, or criticize government, but this is still what a majority of people do. And thats a key component to its existence.

If we get more oil, in exchange for some real estate or "pollution", or more farmland in exchange for rainforrest, how is that a tragedy? Where there is dire exploitation and down right unreasonable pollution by oil drilling companies is where their actions are government santioned. Its in 3rd world countries, where the land is primarily overseen by government - who doesent really own the land, and care not for it either, only the money the oil companies will pay them. - So thats the real tragedy in this case, when government owns land, and lets others 'develop' it. Thats a tragedy because the 3rd party 'developing' or using the land will exploit it, its not theirs, and the 'real' owner, the government, have no incentive to care either. So it becomes an environmental disaster. 
The example with the pool im not willing to get into because that seems like a theory set up with the right conditions that make the theory feasable. However we need real world examples imo since we are talking about an economic phenomenon basically.

Basically they dont, and in that they take a risk. But they have a somewhat strict sign up process where you have to verify your phone number. Other than that there is a limit to how much you can buy on a credit card per week. Reduces the scope of a possible fraud. If you have enough customers, legit, that is, they can absorb the costs of the eventual chargeback frauds. Does that make sense? Circle does not have to have a 100% chargeback fraud free system, as long the majority of use is legitimate and does not get charged back (and i assume this is the case...) then they dont have to deal with the charge backs. They can just go meh when it happens, and pass on the relevant information to the authorities.

Thanks. I have a question tho.


Basicially what the economic theory is about, is depletion of resources, but isnt this a naturally occuring phenomen? I mean we are consuming oil, therefor we are depleting oil reserves. However cars continue to become more energy effecient, or consume less oil etc. As well as some manufactorers are experimenting with alternative to the gasoline engine entirely with for example an electrical one. I mean, i dont understand how people would rationally consume alot of oil, not be interested in consuming less or comming up with alternatives or more energy efficient designs. That can never happen voluntarily imo. There has got to be an underlying issue if he has observed a situation where this took place.
I guess the gist of it is, when a resource is running out, someone is going to grab even more of it. Its running out, so i want the rest. But thats competition isnt it? Thats not neccesarily a tragedy? Please do explain

Its not problematic, and it will be even less problematic the higher the investment needed in order to mine. They are not going to fool around when they have invested millions of dollars into mining equipment. Thats supposing ghash.io is a single entity. Its not.

I dont think you understand. You need the blockchain otherwise bitcoins wouldnt be worth anything. As long as the blockchani exists and you you can go into and out of it as you please, off-chain transactions are fine. In reality off-chain transactions is the true promise of scalability. Think of it like a matrix. The blockchain is used to settle which institution own which bitcoin. Then you can choose to send bitcoin from paypal into the ebay system, and paypal will, eventually pass the amount owed to ebay (ebay owes its merchant) and that will be settled via the blockchain. Does that make sense? I think the founder of bitpay sees bitcoin the same way, the blockchain is used to settle large amounts, and individual institutions do the day to day work so to speak, off chain. But dont qoute me on that.

This is actually not true, or perhaps i misunderstood what you meant. But government can always be around. Because, when it all comes down to it, they are 'thugs' with guns. Thats it. Government is an institution who is allowed to initiate violence against others. Bitcoin does not 'solve' this. And governments have existed under very solid monetary systems. However, its only inflation and central banking which has allowed for enourmous government, world wars and so on. And bitcoin might put a stopper to this. However they are still thugs with guns, there is a chance they will begin going after people who use or associate themselves with bitcoin in any way for example, leaving no choice but to use government money.

If. The son. Is not as good at running the buisness as his dad, that will come at the expense of the buisness. However this is only the case if competition isnt kept artificially at bay. The competition then will be able to eat of the buisness of the FatherToSon buisness. However, if there exist tight regulation, it is likely the buisness can go on, the son will be wealthier than his dad, even tho he does a poor job, because little to no-one is able to compete with him.

Big banking is the collusion between bank and state right? The only thing that could take it down was if the state were to stop colluding with the banks. But at the moment its too profitable an endeavour for both. They are not going to end it. However the only way big banking and government can really exist is by being a parasite on the general population. Parasites are not supposed to kill their hosts by leeching too much, but that is unfortunately what big banking and the government is doing. So big banking and government will end the moment the general population can no longer bear their burden. Dont know when then this is, or wether bitcoin will allow people to easier avoid the parasite, it probably will

power corrupts? define power then.
I think you will find those who become corrupted, do not operate on a free-market basis. Corruption belongs in government, because the costs are offset to 3rd parties. Perhaps corruption belongs in big buisness as well, but that is because of various rules and regulation cornering the market, but also the advanced legal landscape that allows smart people to do questionable things. Loopholes. Last but not least here is the retarded buisness form called a corporation, where the corporation is liable for the mistakes management does. Its crazy. Management screws up, corporation goes bankrupt, corporation (shareholders, employees, etc.) are on the hook(loosing job, share goes to 0). Management usually walks free. No financial liabilites. Anyway..

SO gets spammed, both when it comes to questions, but also when it comes to answers. Upvote/downvote feature sorts the crap from the otherwise useful information.
How much time per day are you going to spend sending emails to people about shit you dont know anything about? Thats what you are saying you are going to do, if bitcoin tipping is introduced. How long do you think you can keep it up, before you eventually realise its not worth your time, or your account will have been disabled for spamming?
Im not sure you understand why spam is a thing, and im not sure bots are going to be able to ruin anything at SO. Useful information is more visible on SO than spam because of the upvote feature. Do you understand? It doesent matter if people make bots, if they spew crap, its going to be at the bottom.
On the other hand, if tipping is introduced, it could become more fun answering but also asking relevant questions and providing useful information.

There is nothing centralized about a mining pool. A mining pool consists of numerous individual miners working to achive the same goal. If ghash stops performing as well as they have until now, ie experiences downtime, stops merge nining, begins double spending, or any other shenanigans that impact miners income, they will begin seeking an alternative.

I find bitcoin interesting because of the monetary policy. It's the opposite of what central banks are doing. The global payments thing is just a bonus.

Your first argument makes sense. But where you go wrong is when you compare it to the situation in bitcoin mining. 
What if 51% of the hashing rate with a single pool does not equal pointing a gun at people? What if its not that dangerous? 
When you look at the nature of a 51% attack, in order for it to be effective, it has to be sustained, and i doubt a pool can do this

@_date: 2014-06-22 08:33:36
You have a few hours to spot malicious activity before it happens, regarding for example ghash. In order to attampt an attack you have to mine in secret first. Given the frequency with which the largest pools/players find blocks you only have to monitor that. If they havent found a block within an hour or two, there would be cause for concern. 
Maybe there could be a system that watches this, and automatically sends out a warning to anyone who would be interested.

Fud as I suspected. He makes the argument blockstream will create something that is better than bitcoin (what? How?) And that more than  half of bitcoiners will use it(ok). He then argues the new coin and therefor it's users  will be sacrificed in the interests of blockstream - they control their developers (lol what? They can leave or whistle blow at any time they want, and even blocksrteams coin will be in competition with every other coin out there. People ha e choice.) -  so what did he have in mind? Even if we assume there will be no alter native to blockstream,  and blockstream completely controld the developers, how could blockstream benefit from going against the interests of it's user base?

Niether is a pool with alot of hashing power. The fundamentals dont change wether or not miners have formed a pool with a majority of hashing power or not. The incentive is still to mine honestly. The more serious attacks are still chance based, and a pool is likely to end up with orphaned blocks before it is successful. If the attack, lets say a double spend is 100% successful and miners dont get a chance to suspect a thing, a big portion is not going to trust the pool afterwards. Besides you dont need 50% to do double spends. And a 51% attack will never be fruitful if you attempt it with miners you dont really control.

It sounds like you are fear mongering. "A single LARGE entity controlling the LARGEST pool"
What do you have against a large entity controlling a large pool? I dont understand the problem. In order for the pool to get any traction it must first deliver on all the key areas miners demand. What do you think this is?
Id prefer if GHash had more competition, but im not afraid if they get near 50% again. I trust the miners. I trust the underlying incentive structure, it has worked for 5 years. No-one is going to bother with malicious activity, especially not now when the investments required is higher, and the reward for not doing it high as well. 
The way i see it Ghash.io or any pool for that matter can choose. Double spend maybe 1 or two times, and throw their status as a popular mining pool away. Or keep working with/for the miners, and enjoy the lucrative position they have.

I think the reason is quite simple. Accepting bitcoin for a big company is only possible if they can get a payment processor to the work for them. That means the costumer pays BTC, but the company gets the local currency. Dollar, Canadian Dollar etc. that shop runs on normally.
So why international companies only accept btc in USA is because bitpay and coinbase do sucha good job of being man in the middle, and they are mostly USD focused..

Just a personal opinion.

I think you are taking things too literately. What the OECD meant is that Bitcoin will never be mainstream. Its already a currency. Whos denying that? OECD is saying it wont become mainstream, because its not legal tender. But no-one is arguing bitcoin can become legal tender. That would be stupid. Thats like making gold legal tender. Legal tender is only for things that are worthless. Its a way to force value on things.

The primary reason people are so confident going balls deep with alts is because bitcoin is so sound. Plus they all think the money they have on paper is real and can go into bitcoin any time they want. But they can't,  bitcoin is only 35% of the total market. This is also why altcoins have a bigger downside than up because everyone is already balls deep. Soon as someone begins to take profit it will cause a collapse of grand proportions, and I doubt anyone is willing to give them any bitcoin for cheap at that point ma king it worse. So best of luck to altcoin gamblers. Easy come easy go.

How can you be comparing the two? Nothing has been shut down in bitcoin land, an exchange is acting wierd. Only people who are affected are those who choose to affiliate with this specific exchange. Due to the history of the exchange and the relative small size of the bitcoin economy, the situation regarding the exchange is spreading panic or whatever you want to call it across the board. But its got nothing fundamentally to do with bitcoin

the faster blocktimes dont really matter anyway. dogecoin has 1 minute blocks, but its not more secure. for example just-dice which runs on bitcoin requires 1 confirmation (~10 minutes) before you can use your sent bitcoins. the doge-dice equivalent requires 10 confirmations which is also ~10 minutes before the deposit can be spent:)

He works with airbnb. The app is using the api. It does not store private keys. Security you set up on coinbase.com will still be in effect. If he decided to attempt to steal whatever coins he could not only would he piss of coinbase, but apple as well since malware uploaded to app store makes them look bad as well. If he turns bad and takes some bitcoin snyway, and passes up the oppertunity to work at coinbase and so on..... Coinbase would likely reimburse people. Want me to go on?

Finding a company that turned out successful after recieving money from government does not mean most buisnesses that recieve money from government turns out succesful. Would you agree with this?
Furthermore, i dont think the money that went to Tesla was supposed to go to Tesla. It was supposed to to go Ford, General Motors, who as far as i know still havent produced an electric vehicle. They were spending money on highly experimental vehicles instead, and in fact was going bankrupt because they couldnt even sell enough traditional cars. ...
Basicially you found an exception to the rule, When buisnesses get money from government, it means they are incompetent. I would be willing to accept that Coinify may be an exception to this rule as well, but then lets discuss that instead of this pseudo discussion where you try to prove me wrong, because ugh the truth hurts.

No. And no. A 3rd party couldnt set up and start issuing bitcoin or any other coin. First of all, there is a legal issue, second of all, who is going to trust them? When you have the blockchain, off-chain transactions become possible, because the blockchain can be used to verify the "integrity" of said institutions. Naturally there is going to be competition among the various payment processors, also called online wallets, in being the most transparant because thats what end users will want, presuambly. In fact, off-chain transactions is unavoidable, for example when it comes to micro tx. Also when/if miner fees begin to rise, there is going to be naturl pooling of transactions. Call it what you want.

You got to be a fool to think the blockchain can handle internet trade of even a small country. Well perhaps it could. But it couldnt handle the internet trade of for example Europe or the US. Too many transactions. Off chain is where its going to be at. And its not bad at all. Paypal may be hated, but at the end of the day they get the job done. With bitcoin, there is going to be alot more competition and the blockchain only serves to give value to bitcoins initially, and then compaies can try and build on top it payment systems, banks, etc:) I think its exciting times. In reality, one of the biggest problems with the legacy payment and currency system is the lack of competition. Bitcoin has the potential to change this, depending on the degree to which government prevents competition, as it has done with legacy banking system and many other industries..,.,.

Sounds like a similar problem that is occurring with intellectual property, where it is acquired solely as a defensive manouvre, ie. to keep others from further developing it. It seems a bit wrong to me, ideas and 'spectrums' should be free, as in not protected or guarded with licenses and copyrights which just boils down to violence. If you infringe on a copyright the state which has a mandate to initiate violence against you, comes after you. Initially with a fine or prison sentence, but if you do not comply and resist them, they may take your life if you escalate your defence, when they come for you.. What's built on top of this are mega corporations who use this principle, these laws, licenses, copyrights and what not to protect their interests.

I think thats because bitcoin is in a reccession. Although people who bought earlier than late 2013 are up on their coins and are more likely to spend them, many people are probably sitting with bitcoins in the red and are not willing to spend. When you see the next boom, ie. if/when the price returns to for example $900 or more, there will be more people with bitcoin in the green who are then more likely to spend.

Well. I dont like the term regulation when talking about government regulation. In reality that is rules which are backed by force or violence. If you dont follow them, too bad for you, in jail you go. This kind of power can be abused, even tho there is what they call a democracy protecting it, a constitution, and that the legislative and enforcing branch and so on are separated. Its still possible to influence policy makers and even the institutions that are suppoed to keep track of companies and make sure they live up to the law.
So, when we talk about environmental policy, it can be influenced. The insitutions which are suppose to watch over the possible poluters can be influenced, and pollution can happen. What was the name of that company again? Duke energy? Or something. There was clear government rules on what they could or could not do but government regulators had supposedly turned a blind eye. They had been polluting alot. 
Perhaps that is an exception to the rule. That there are many others cases where pollution doesent happen because of government. Well, roads are insanely subsidized by government. It basically enables everyone to own a car. It makes it economically feasable, because the roads are so havilty subsidized. The entire car culture depends on this. Some would say thats not a bad thing because they need a car. Well if we are talking environment, the car culture is very polluting. It prevents highyl effective public transport to take place, which reduces emmissions and what not. Look at all the cars that produced, scrapped etc. It requires alot of resources and alot of energy. So thats another side to it. Free markets optimise and optimiste and optmise, there is no end to it, because thats just what the market does. When it gets restricted or skewerd by government, things start going wrong. For example the BP disaster was kind of a consequence of government regulation because no-one wanted them drilling closer to the shore. They were forced to drill so far out that in the event of an accident it would be almost impossible to fix. And of course its the companies who have the expertise and experience in preventing accidents and disasters. What does the government know about this? So when the government steps in and sets the bar for how to do something environmentally friendly, even if its not enough, or even the wrong thing, companies only do as little as they can. Does that make sense?

The beginning life of a side chain will likely be rough. But the better it is (ie. the more useful etc.) the more mining will eventually be allocated and the less prone to an attack it will become.
Also, how many coins can you merge mine at a time? And will the fees be higher because there are no block rewards? Will high fees make side-chain transactions worth it? Hard to tell. Im looking forward to when/if the first one is implemented

Well, thats why the price is decreasing imo. The inflation is high, and the exchange rate reflects this. I believe i was late to the party, to figure this out, but i had been discussing or rather predicting sell-offs or panics when we were at $500.

I think this kind of drama is akin to saying a deflationary currency will never work. However bitcoin has built in functions that will make it work. Ie. the divisiblity of the currency. Great.
Pooling is the same thing. People say  a pool with 50% hash rate or more is not going to work, however bitcoin has built in functions that makes a pools hashrate negligible. For example the confirmation system makes double spending difficult. There is also the "Voting with feet" aspect. Miners are going to be furious if a pool abandons legitimate mining. Regardless if it was on purpose or not. Many miners will leave for the competition because they can no longer trust the pool that fucked up.

I promise you a good price
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:57:31
This is not what happens in practice tho. When a pool gets above 50% no-one cares (except reddit apparantly) If this pool begins double spending, attacking the network, miners will especially care and leave the pool. Exchange rate may or may not decline, but i dont think a double spend, even a ridicicoulsy big, succesful one will have much impact on the price. Miners who got fooled into doing it, will leave the pool, and it will not be able to do it again. Regarding the 51% attack. That is likely going to piss miners off even more, and will also leave the pool.

According to their website they are hashing with 37 PH. According to bitcoinwatch.org total hashing power is currently 93PH. That means 39% hash rate.
Just random info. Also  is not a 100% reliable way of determining hash rate, because its based on whichever pool relays the block to bc.i first afaik. That means someone in Croatia could mine a block but if GHash.IO relays it first, due to their excellent network of nodes, then bc.i will make it look like GHash.IO mined it.

Why do people think bitcoin is good for micro payments? Is it because its divisible up to 0.xxxxxxxx? The dollar is equally divisible if not more. You can give 0.000001 Cent if someone was willing to provide that functionality, but its ont there. Its not economically viable. Maybe it will be different with bitcoin but not with a blockchain transaction. There is only so much space in 1 block, and if bitcoin becomes really popular people are going to bid out each other to get in the first next block. Even now the transaction fee, even tho transactions are subsidized with newly created bitcoin, it is  ~$0.07 which is kind of significant. Thats why i think bitcoin wont be used for micro transactions but for huge fucking transactions. If you send $1 mio USD worth via the blockchain the fee is still $0.07 which is extremely cheap compared to other services.

Not all bitcoins mined are being sold. I dont believe that. Lets say half of all bitcoins mined are being sold instantly. Thats 1800 every day. At the moment that is enough to put downward pressure on bitcoin, and it has been enough for some time. People get 'restless' when price is declining for longer periods of time and want to do something else with their money. They begin leaving bitcoin for things that have been perfoming better recently. This is going to stop once bitcoin turns around and starts performing better, then people will want to be in bitcoin again. When it will turn around? Well, there probably isnt long, exchange rate wise, meaning, we may be not far from the bottom, how long we will stay there is a different question tho. But once it starts moving mildly up, over a longer period of time, then there is a chance of a bigger rally. This was your daily exchange rate forecast, thank you very much.

Ok but, really, the censorship can be fought in other ways. I am aware that off-chain transactors lend themselves susceptible to the power of the state and therefor its censorship.

Take a look at Stefan Molyneux who takes a peaceful approach to ending statism. Its definately not the easiest, but its peaceful, and its "effective". So why dont we leave bitcoin where it is, and start doing more things personally, speaking out against the censorship. We need to recruit more people, seek, and speak the truth more often.

Im surpsied to learn there is only 12 million millionaries in the world. That cant be true.
More on topic. Define wealth. Ive heard wealth defined as knowledge. It certainly isnt measured only in the amount of money you have. If you own a factory, or have specific skills you can barter with, then you have wealth i would argue. Bitcoin, or money, is just a method with which to exchange wealth, or interact with one another. So bitcoin in itself will not transfer wealth, per say, but if you are holding dollars - which are worthless, per say - then you may end up loosing some money when that house of cards collapses. But thats because your wealth, by being in dollars, was fictitious to begin with. If that makes sense...

I will have to see this before i believe it. Usually what happens when regulation is passed, it cuts of people from doing buisness with whatever is attempted regulated. Usually its young people, people without alot of money, because following regulations is usually expensive.
Lets say the regulations are passed this month, you wont have more people working with bitcoin, you would likely have less, because of the new burdon for working with it.
There may be more money pouring in, but this is the age old mistake, money does not equal quality nor problem solving. I dont want to get into it too much, but socialists thinks if they can just throw money at something, they can solve it. For example healthcare. They force a majority of people to pay into healthcare, then they give it to so-called proffesionals and expect the healthcare system to be the best in the world. What happens is the entire system rots because you cant just throw money at people and expect them to do a good job. 
Even when it comes to private companies, the larger they get, the more wealthy, the worse they usually become. There are so many examples of companies becomming rich, and then starting doing wierd things that nobody wants. In IT, for example google and facebook. Its a matter of discussion but you see alot of people increasingly upset with their 'new ideas' whom everyone is forced to use, and there is little to no competition, even tho their services is not as tightly regulated. Imagine if there were regulation. The wealthy would literately own the market and there was little anyone could do.

This is not true. The pool still consists of numerous individual miners working together finding blocks and sharing the block reward. The pool makes sure they can do this as smoothly as possible. Also, pooling is here to stay, without it many miners didnt stand a chance of mining any BTC.
Anyway, the pool operator has to make sure it stays stable. That means doesent crash, is DDoS resistant, makes miners able to easily add their equipment as they get new and more powerful stuff, they have to be able to easily track the block progress and so on. Furthermore miners want it to be as cheap as possible and GHash has found a way to run a pool with 0% fees. On top of that they do everything else that miners want, and they even offer several coins for merge mining which is a big deal for players with alot of TH.
Anyway, if a pool with alot of support suddenly 180's and starts attacking the network, miners will seek an alternative. The network is still decentralized, however the best pool will always end up with alot of the hashing power, but only for as long as it is honest. I think if it wasnt for pooling it would be considerably easier for a single entity (a pool is not a single entity) to gain 51% of the hashing power, since the network would likely be smaller and grow slower.

The thing about this kind of buisness is you dont make money with the small time fish, you do it with the big time ones. What i mean is, when you have to transfer the euro to someone who only sold 30 euro worth that month.. that is the same effort really compared to sending euro to someone who sold 30k euro worth of stuff. So you want more of those customers. Thats why you see transaction fees on small volume buisnesses but flat rates on large volume, when it comes to this kind of payment processing.

DDoS protection. GHash.IO is having problems with DDoS attacks. Also merge mining. That is attractive to miners who have alot of TH.

How do you know only a few manufacturuers will prodice asic miners? And if they will, would this be a bad thing?
Like i mentioned a patent could make it so 1 asic producer didnt have any competition, and could easier screw "us". But i dont know the likely hood of someone getting a patent on ASICS is. I imagine such a thing would already exist if it were possible to get such a petent...
Anyway. Disregarding patents, if it turns out 1 or 2 companies are the undisputed best at making ASIC miners. So what? They either sell them, in order to generate cash, and maintain their buisness or they use them to mine LEGITMIATELY in order to make cash, and maintain their buisnesss. If they became market leader, and suddenly used all their production capacity to destroy the bitcoin network. Then what? Seems like they will only bring themselves down as well. No bitcoin network, no-one to sell their ASIC miners to. 
I dont see the problem tbh.

These are not internal problems, but external and as such in my opinion less releveant. Technical problems are my biggest worry and i dont see how the bitcoin payment system itself can remain low cost. Transactions fees are bound to increase as we get closer to the block limits. But this should not even be a concern, as off-chain transactions can alleviate much of the load on the blockchain, and make day-to-day purchases with bitcoin feasable/competitive with other means of paying..

Does it really matter? How much does it cost to buy 1 PH worth of asics? How much does it cost to run?
Lets say GHash.IO has 40PH of the 44 in the pool. I imagine that is hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. So its not realistic. Anyway.
Lets say they directly own and control 40PH. That is still only 1/3 of the network hashing rate. 33%. In order to get to 51% they would need to almost double that. That is another 100 million USD worth of asics? I mean, are you concerned? If so, then about what?

An actual exchange where people can trade in-game items for real world currencies would be cool. But thats still far from having the in-game currency being a real currency. If you will, name a game where this might have worked. Diablo? USD instead of gold? WoW, USD instead of gold? Whatabout simcity. When the in-game currency becomes a real currency you have the problem also of where its comming from? Oh so you just raised taxes in you simcity, that means you earn more money. But where its going to come from? The more i think about it, the worse an idea it becomes tbh. Artificial currency is certainly easier to manage, and develop gameplay elements around, because if need be you can create it out of thin air. Not much so if you decide to use a real world currency as your in-game currency although i cannot think of a reason you wanted to do that. It makes everything more difficult, and its going to feel awkward for gamers, and what would be the point?

Thats the truth. As someone who isnt afraid of a pool with 50% hashing power or more. Well. Its a pool of miners. With expensive equipment. They cant be interested in malicious acticity. It will damage the exchange rate of bitcoin, and the investment they have made in their mining equipment. They will also likely earn much less attempting a 51% attack or double spend chains etc. So the risk of a malicious pool is there, however its incredibly small

this is interesting. when so many people are shorting. idk if shorting is the correct thing. nevertheless short ltc. when bitcoin is a bull market, ltc is bear, and vice versa. Notice ltc is down a few percentages measured in bitcoin since the bearwhale was taken down. and ltc and doge was doing good when bitcoin was in a bear market. when bitcoin is a bull market, alts when priced in btc are tanking, because people with those alts want to be in bitcoin since it turned into a bull. when bitcoin is a bear, the money starts looking for alternatives, and the alts (ponzies as well as all kinds of instruments tend to do good). Now bitcoin is bull market, i would argue, although its probably a little too soon to tell. Nevertheless, i would argue its a bull marketand the alts when measured in btc will tank a little.

You also have to keep in mind that bitcoiners themselves have taken alot of heat themselves for talking about it around town. So if you come to their place, you better have your shit together. Its a hardcore crowd. Just deal with it, im sure they mean no harm.

You pretty much nailed it. Thats why its not a problem the amount of hashing power they have. They are bitcoin friendly, and if they stop being it and use their positon to attack the network, you can be sure all their customers are going to rage. ghash/cex will only kill themselves if they attempt to attack the network
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:40:24
Of course there is. The owners of the money, the people who give the scammers are the ones that can stop it, by not giving money to begin with. 
Your solution if i understand it correctly is to give someone power and control of everyone, and then have them make rules that benefit the end user. It is a retarded solution because how do you expect these people to not make bad rules, how do you expect that the scammers etc. dont end up making the rules?
I mean, the shit Lawsky and co came up with clearly demonstrates that the crooks are in charge. Thats just my opinion. If you really cared about a disruptive new technology why would you regulate it, to the extend they intend, in its early stages. Its basic economics. When you raise the barrier to entry you also prevent people from working in the area. And if it isnt broke dont fix it? Imo bitcoin has been on a steady rise and more and more legimitate companies are getting on board. Its transforming into a more honest and recognized economy or asset and is more along this way today than it has ever been. So please stop interferring with the growth mr. Lawsky and co (You includedm since you support it?)...

What percentage of mined bitcoins are not being sold you think, and what are you basing this assumption on? When it comes to the volume on exchanges, how is it calculated? Why do you bring it up? Couldnt the same 25 bitcoins be traded back and forth 100 times, and then the volume will show 2500?
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:02:00
This is why i am worried with "hard coding" this sort of stuff in. It could be argued that is centralization. Or a centralizedish solution.
I would be in favor of no blocksize limit, or more specifically having the network decide a maximum blocksize, but i dont understand how to achive this and the possible consequences. Someone argued a floating blocksize with no limit could potentially have the blockchain grow too fast for its own good. And this much is true. But i believe hard-coding growth of blocksize, having to revisit it etc. is not the best solution. Maybe a good solution right now, but ultimately a more decentralized one should be pursued.

The incentive structure the original creator but into bitcoin to keep miners from doing bad things do not change if miners pool together.  You may have a point that people can be idiots in large groups but. You have to be short sighted to believe a miner will hash away at a pool that isnt honest. Why wouldnt he switch?
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:37:24
Mining in a small pool being equal to mining in a bigger one is only a theory. Miners say themselves they earn more by being part of a bigger pool. However thats only 1 side of the coin. GHash.IO for example offer merged mining of several different coins, thats a bonus to productivty from a miners perspective. They have 0 fee. That is amazing. Miners are willing to take this risk as long as GHash.IO is not doing any significant harm to the network, which would also reduce the productivity of their miners
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:24:43
I dont think the two are related. At least the miners have kept up growing exponentially through the bubbles as of late. When it crashed from $266 to $45 miners kept adding hashing power at an exponential rate
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:00:36
Do you have a list that disprooves the theory? There are also several examples where the government is involved. For example roads which are subsidized, makes people able to afford big cars, and not carpool etc. It creates a mess, because the government interferes with the market forces.
The missisipy river case also has government involved because the pollution travels across borders. What is a mexican going to do against an american with his lawyers and shit in the back? You dont see polution being passed on from one american to the other without there being a dispute. But mexicans cant dispute americans that easily because government..
@_date: 2014-06-14 11:46:45
Miners dont join the largest pool, they join a pool that is large enough AND have high uptime, merge mine options, little or no fee, good security measures, sleek web interface and so on. Atm. GHash.IO is the best in this regard, thats why they are the biggest

@_date: 2014-06-17 14:49:26
What much power? It doesent matter if you have 1% hashing rate or 50%. A double spend vs a 0 conf. gambling site is equally as easy. The power GHash.IO have derives from their ability to satisfy the miners. They are currently the best pool, thats why they are the biggest. Miners want to mine honestly, among other things, and if ghash.io stops mining honestly and fucks with the blocks its over for ghash.io.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:22:04
why do people buy that?
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:08:03
They probably could. But they couldnt hack all pools simultanously and they cant prevent the miners from leaving. Hacking a pool, diverting its miners to malicious activity will have the excact same effect as if the owner did it directly. Maybe a succesful double spend.. Maybe a 51% attack that would control the network for a few hours until enough miners have finally left for a pool that is not hacked.

I mean with micro transactions you dont need to wait for confirmations. Or mabe you do if it turns out someone is systematically able to double spend 0 conf transactions, and it became widewspread. Nevertheless, i dont think an alternate chain is the solution, maybe if the coin in question is maintained by the relevant newspaper or whatever, sort of like Lets Talk Bitcoin Does, which is an interesting concept... Anyway, i think the solution is not another blockchain when it comes to micro tx, its a 3rd party one, and an off-chain one:)
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:28:57
Yes. A 51% attack is only efficient as long as you keep the majority of the hashing power. However their hashing power will crumble if they were to initiate one

You cannot do alot of damage by reverting a bitcoin transaction. Lets assume you are buying a house. If you scam the dealer, and the bitcoin transaction turns out to be fradulent they will just take the house back and possibilty criminially prosecute you. And what is up with the inteligence agency operations? What do you estimate the chance of someone, even the FBI or CIA being able to take over the two biggest mining pools simultanously being? And how long do you think it will be before the miners have just switched to the next best pool and things return to normal? I mean come on. The chances of what you are talking about is so small, and the damage in the event it does happen, are likely to be insignificant
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:12:33
I think you are overeacting. There has not been a single case of a pool doing legitimate damage to the network. The threat is blown out of proportions. If you decide to sell more bitcoin when the combined mining power of gigahish.io will find 60% of blocks in a day, please let me know, i will buy them for cheap (Hint they will be reaching this in the near future.

Today the internet is too big to be stopped, but for bitcoin its a bit different.

I cant believe how unhealthy the buisness environment is. Companies that are big enough will usually have several lawsuits pending, either initiated by themselves or against them by someone else. I cant imagine how much they spend on their legal departments. Of course this is additional cost that is pushed down to the consumer, and i wonder whats the point?
When someone can price fix, its because their competition is artificially limited, i guarantee it. And if you look at the banking sector, or payment processing there is. loads. of regulation and expensive license requirements to get through. Thats how the big stay big and could even consider price fixing, because there is little to no competition because of the law.
Anyway, i hope to live to see a truly free market. A market free of coercion from government, because it will kick ass. It will put the internet and computer revolution to shame. We would be going to mars and beyond, there would be little to no poverty, and even the environment would be better taken care of. Holy shit. I hope this 'house of cards' crashes soon, so there can be built a truly free society where people who want to work are not restricted or down right stolen from. I cant see how you can define taxation as anything else than stealing or blackmailing.

The beauty of this is that if 401k go bust you still have your bitcoin. If everything gets turned into traditional financial instrument, bitcoin looses alot of its value because it can go poof along with the rest of the financial industry. You want to keep real bitcoin alongside your 401k and what not. Not inside it..

Box coolers are not as good as the ones you can purchase. Liquid cooling etc. Noise reduction etc. Bitcoin, same thing. Payment system comes with it, but, you can get much better. Exchanges dont use on-chain transactions, and the most popular gambling sites dont use it either. The blockchain is just used to verify you own the original deposit and 'transfer' the ownership to the site.. temporarily or permanent if you loose. So yea. There is no scalabiltty issue in bitcoin.

Blockchain is not the end all solution, off chain transactions have no limits, at least none that visa/mastercard doesent have. Meaning its entirely possible some company ala bitpay or bitpal (love this name.. company doesent exist tho) will provide the infrastructure neccesary to do these millions of transactions per second without needing the blockchain. The exchanges already does many transactions per second and they dont need the blockchain, there are also gambling sites such as just-dice which does even more bitcoin transactions per second i imagine without the use of the blockchain.

If security wasnt good enough for web-wallets they wouldnt exist. As always security is a matter of compromise and i am well aware that there are super techniques to make your bitcoin ultra safe, but those methods are not convenient. Web wallets are a nice mix between convenience and security. I mean, this is you using the government to fulfil your fantasy. For example you believe web-wallets are too insecure therefor government must prevent people from using or making them. I cannot stand this mentality

I still dont understand what the problem is with the bitcoin community. They have achived alot. Almost 4 years ago the first pizza for bitcoin was bought. This subreddit has been the stronghold for the bitcoin community pretty much since the start, so if you come in here acting like a noob things does not bode well for you. Isnt that to be expected given their history? When bitcoiners first started talking about bitcoin around town the result was usually mockery. Even still around the internet bitcoin will be mocked. In spite of this bitcoin has come a very long way. Basically bitcoiners are hardcore, and you just have to deal with it

Something is not correct just because millions of people believe it. And I don't know how you get through life if you think you have to work. To me it seems like you can never enjoy it which is sad because its such an effective way of making a living. Working is voluntary. You are free to not do it. You are free to slack, to be poor. Its your choice. That's why the capitalist system cannot exploit people. If you look at government that is another story. Everyone is forced to pay taxes, they keep increasing and at the same time they borrow massive amounts money on your behalf and if not, your children and future generations because they will have to pay it off.

The blockchain cant really compete with the networks of visa etc. there needs to be a off-chain network for bitcoin as well if bitcoin is to compete with them. the blockchain is likely going to be crowded in the future, it is likely going to be a privilige to use it, a privilige that will cost you, at least if you want your transaction included in the next block. As someone else mentioned, the blockchain is also subsidized atm. with 25 new bitcoins distributed among the miners of the winning mining pool.... In the future mining will likely have to be paid for more by transaction fees and that could also push up the price. Needless to say, the blockchain, cannot compete with the payment processing network of VISA. HOWEVER. If bitcoin remain free, and little to not regulated, the services that build on top of bitcoin for bitcoin, the new payment networks may be able to compete and put the VISA and paypal networks and fees to shame.

I am no expert on this subject, but there are many bank robberies every year and they are paid for collectively through inflation among other things. The costs are socialised, so you do not notice it. My bitcoin balance was not affected by the mtgox situation, the exchange rate took a hit but thats because the market is still immature.
 You cant compare bitcoin exchanges with the legacy banking system because its so new, its purely digital etc. its a learning experience for everyone and there is no truly established or safe way to do things yet. it leads to increased criminal oppertunites as well as traps for the incompetent. Its different with regular banking which has existed for years, have university grade educations dedicated to it and the sector as a whole who have the benefit of beign heavily subsized if you can call it that, by the state. The government is holding a huge hand under the banking sector and it means criminals and inept are getting away with their shenanigans much easier.

Make sure you dont do your bitcoin buisness etc. on a computer which others frequently use, or which others frequently would have access to.

I would not recommend a pirated version for security reasons.

That was my narrative to a certain extend. I didnt understand why you would trust mtgox with any money after they became involved with this kind of things. I used to trade at mtgox, but i started looking for alternatives after this incident. Also have to keep in mind they announced withdrawal delays shortly after this, the writing was basicially on the wall. You really need to be careful with what you do and whom you trust with thousands of dollars worth of btc or anything else for that matter. And im not sure mtgox really qualified. Anyway...

Well people will still be owning bitcoin, and if there is a demand for sending bitcoin cheaper than $1 this is where the OC transactions come in.

The thing is, things are not that bad. Its not like every bitcoin buisness is a crook, and running way with peoples money. WIth this regulation everyone is basically assumed to be a crook and have to undergo alot of - expensive - licensing and various other requirements.

This is very hard for me to understand for some reason. Are you saying, if someone sent a ton of 1 satoshi tx'es it would exist in a block somewhere, yet to be mined? But it wont, because every other block, will have a combined higher tx fee? I still dont understand how it prevents spam. Wouldnt the spammer just do his work, over 10 blocks, and achive the same amount of spam, as he was able to in 1 block if the blocksize limit was removed? I mean, he would pay the same, the damage would be the same in the end, but with no blocksize limit, it would incur faster?

The bitcoin market is not unregulated its grey market. The problem is proffesionals are reluctant in moving into the arena, and transparancy is a hard thing to come by because the few indivuduals who have established themselves are afraid of the government. If bitcoin were to be a perfectly unregulated market, it would have to enjoy the same circumstances as the internet did when it first arrived. Entrepenours didnt have to fear government, there was no unclear rules. They could just go ahead and do whatever they wanted to do. Its not the same with bitcoin and thats why scams etc. are more widespread

That which you mention is not free. Being able to to use credit cards world wide, with consumer protection etc. Someone is paying bill, if not the consumer directly then indirectly via increased prices on whatever good or service you are purchasing. Other than that bitcoin is simpler, you scan a QR kode and send money. You dont need to provide sensitive information or type in a credit card number expiry date etc. Also if bitcoin volatility decreases consumers can keep their bitcoin and have them slowly increase in value. Something which makes bitcoin very unique

They may or may not. Truth is if you still provide value to the company you should be able to negotiate a fair salary. If the employer is able to save on salaries if the income tax is removed, then these savings are passed on to the consumer. It means cheaper goods and services.
And really. Just because you cant imagine a world without theft, or just because someone cant explain it, doesent mean we should accept the theft.

Schiff didnt predict the end of bitcoin, he made the argument that price of bitcoin is important because its what drives alot if interest toward it. He also makes the argument that if bitcoin price is low, there is not much purchasing power in the system, since the total market cap would be low, which again would make the payment system irrelevant to merchants. He is right on both accounts, its a legimiate criticism, but wether or not the value of bitcoin is going to continue down, has stopped its  growth - it has grown or increased alot since its inception - is another debate.

That is hardly the truth. Human run things can be imune from corruption, or very resistant to it. The problem arise once you have a monopoly, and the government is just that. Its a monopoly on violence. To be more specific, the government is a group of people who can initate violence against you, in order to solve a social problem. On top of that, you may not defend yourself against their initation of violence, for if you do, they may escalate it, until either if you are dead. And since the government has so much power(derived from this principle or right they extend to themselves), you will usually be the dead one. This is what happens when the cops come knock at your door, if you escalate your defence against them, they may kill you. Legal Murder. If you do not believe me, try not paying a tax or a ticket. The cops will come eventually, if you do not open the door, they will break it down. If you point a gun at them, asking them to gtfo out of your house, they will kill you. You resisted arrest. Legal Murder. Everything the government does is based on this principle. Every law that is passed, every tax, relies on the police or even military, going to people and roughing them up, if they do not pay or otherwise comply. There is no easy way to escape this reality, so most people end up accepting it, and playing along, but that doesent make it right. And as long as people play along, the atrocities, will continue. We happen to be somewhat well informed in the west, and be strong, so the governments are scared, to some degree. They are corrupt none-the less, and given enough time, they will have consumed us entirely, with their laws, taxes and regulations. The gist of that, tho, will be that the economy collapses, and with it, the parasicitc and corrupt government that took us to that point.

What kind of adoption are we talking about? What did bitcoin promise in this regard? First and foremost i think its best suited for internet trade, and if we focus solely on that, what could make it fail?
I hear bitcoin doesent offer an incentive for consumers although it does since its deflationary, it can be a store of value, at least more so in the long run than the current fiat alternatives. And if merchants will want bitcoin because they see a reason to, they will try to entice consumers in using it, for example discounts which gives consumers another incentive to maintain a bitcoin balance.

Nono. A Centralized organisation cannot fight decentralized violence. Not effectively. There are so many examples of this. 
For example crime. This is something the state has been advocating against for a very long time. But crime still happens, especially petty crime - ie the decentralized kind. This is up to the individual citizen to protect himself from this decentralized crime. For example by locking the door to his home, putting valuable things out of sight in the car etc. I mean you get the picture right? Decentralized violence has to be fought via decentralized means. When you need the police now, they are only 5 mins away. Its a nice joke, but its true. Anyway.
So there are also violent conflicts around the world. For example Israel vs Hamas or The US vs Taliban/Al Quida. Here you have a centralized entity the US and Israel trying to fight to a large degree a decentralized one, and its not working. These conflicts are more than a decade old, 1st and 2nd world war combined were over in a shorter time period than these.

Why should you be allowed to leech of of others work, IE grooveshark, who put music out to the people. Just curious. Wouldnt you be glad your music is able to be heard, since you spent 15 years making/learning how to do it?
Seriously, people who bitch about not getting paid when their music is being played are not true artists. We would still have plenty of artists, even if there was no IP laws etc. Plenty of good shit, available to EVERYONE

What happened was GHash.IO relayed ~51% of the blocks found within a 24 hour time span. That is because people use blockchain.info's pool charts which is based on whichever pool relays a new block first. GHash.IO is connected with some very fast nodes, so they will sometimes be the first to relay a block to blockahin.info even tho it was another pool that mined it.
So GHash didnt really have the amount of hashing power people feared. And even so, its still a pool, they cannot do effective 51% attacks

The banking sector is one of the most regulated of all. Yet enourmous banks go bankrupt, require bailouts in the billions if not trillions. And even then, the banks future is not secured. With mtgox and an unregulated market the bad apples are being sorted from the good. We are already moving on, and its been less than a week.

If your wallet supports it, use two factor authentication. If the attacker gets your password, he still needs the 2nd key from your two factor, which changes all the time. Make sure you set it up in an environment you are reasnoably sure is not compromised.
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:37:03
in order for a 51% attack to start an attacker would have to generate a series of blocks within 10 minutes correct? he would also have to keep upgrading his hashing power in order to prevent the network getting back a larger share. In this day and age the difficulty increase is exponential, so we can assume the hashing rate increase is exponential. Therefore in order to sustain a 51% attack the attacker has to increase his hashing rate exponentially

But do you realise what is happening? In Denmark the average person can barely save, because taxes and costs of living is high. Buisnesses are also having a hard time. It means there is less capital to go around. When people cant save, there is no capital:) Then there is no investment, generally speaking.   So if you are a prime minister and you care about the economy, startups and so on, you lower taxes, and make it more affordable to live there. See government gets its money from other people, it doesent produce anything itself, basicially. It doesent earn them. Other people earn the money, and the government takes a cut. In Denmark it happens to be such a large cut that there apparantly are not enough investors compared to other places, if one were to believe you?..

I dont imagine miner fees are going to become cheaper. If bitcoin becomes popular its likely there is going to be competition to be the first ones in the next block. It will basically be a bidding war and maybe transactions fees could cost as much as a dollar or more if you want it in the next block. If you want it confirmed within 10 minutes.  But this is only if you want a confirmation. You dont need confirmations for day-to-day spending and i imagine a network and solution with off-chain transactions is going to present itself sooner than later, and they will make it cheaper than the 6 cents or whatever it currently costs to be included in the next block. Another benefit is also instant confirmation on the off-chain transaction.

I think this cat and mouse approach to crime needs to stop, it should have stopped long ago, and a completely different approach in trying to prevent and stop crime needed to be taken. Cat and mouse, not going to work until the entire economy is shut down, and not even then will it be possible. Im thinking about the economy that exists in jails, where even drugs get around.

I dont know where you get your data, but GHash.IO has never had 50% of the hashing power.

If you remove pooled mining from the equation this is excactly what will happen.

However its not going to be that easy. A double spend has a chance of failing. And it has as 100% chance of being discovered.

Im sure a smart guy like you would be able to figure out the foundation is a btc sink. They are like politicans, all talk and appearances. Anyway, im sure you are also able to figure out that there is no problem. I guess some online services should be on higher alert, since there is a risk of a double spend, however its offset by the success this large mining pool is having by being honest.
Also, isnt it ironic how a few days ago everyone was shouting ghash.io and cex.io. Few days later their hashing power increased. Well it looks like the drama had the opposite effect of what was intended. It was free marketing for gigahash and cex. Anyway, as long as they can be trusted they will likely continue to grow, the second they cant they will begin to vanish

I think that what you are missing is if cex.io can sell something for 100% profit, competitors will rise fast.
Lets say you are right in speculating 1/4 of the bitcoin hashing rate is directly under cex control. That is 25PH. Fucking huge amount. Even if they double that, they still wouldnt have enough to 51% attack the network. And how much would it cost to add 25PH to your farm? How fast could you do it? I think if you bought all asics currently being produced you could get 10PH worth every 14 days. But then you would have to buy EVERYTHING and that is not going to happen. Cex.io cannot do this even if they were filthy rich........ right?

Not neccesarily. There would have been more competition, more exchanges to choose from as well.
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:12:54
Regulation does too. It raises the barrier of entry, reducing competition, increasing the likelyhood of corruption if not plain bad buisness practices. The main reason bitcoin struggles to leave its grey market status with the numerous scams, hacks and bad buisness practices (im looking at you gox.) is because regulation is too tight to allow for proper competition.
I also noticed you used the term launder drug money, that thats why inhibiting bitcoin innovation is ok. But it would be simpler to call of the war on drugs, so that criminals couldnt make money on drugs to begin with.
@_date: 2014-01-29 13:38:50
Regulation is not concise enough. If you look at all the laws the government have tried to implement, to fix a problem, or better the economy and call them regulation, regulation has actually made the economy worse of. Regulatoin lead to the dot-com bubble, regulation lead to the housing bubble, and regulation leads to the crony actions big wall-street banks can do. So no, if you just say there is a need for more Regulation, that is false. Regulation more often than not ends up creating more problems than they solve. But do you have anything specific youd like the government to do with bitcoin im all ears.

GHash does not have any mining power per definition. GHash is a mining pool. It takes care of everything from web interface, ddos attacks, difficulty adjustments and so on. They dont do mining directly. However CEX.io have mining equipment and they mine at Ghash.io. The owner of CEX and Ghash is likely the same but meh. 
What you saw was probably a decrease in the hashing power at GHash.io but that could be due to a number of things, first and foremost some miners switching to another pool. However they will soon realise no-pool is as good as GHash.io and they will be back.

Lol. "The best solution is to come up with a solution". Do you realise how dumb this sounds?
Besides, you cannot grasp that a pool does not control the hashing power 100%? The only reason it has any hashing power is because its honest. If it stops being honest the hashing power will leave. It does not control it 100%
So remind me again, what is the problem and what do you propose?

Blame the political establishment who nearly at the wave of a hand can spend billions of dollars, at little to no risk to themselves. Im tired of people focusing on the banks, who are just playing a game of using the government to their advantage. Dont hate the player. Every industry does this, and thats why i think it makes sense to take a look at government. Because it was not intended to be used by the wealthy for their own gain, but thats how in many cases things have ended up.

See this is the problem. There was no existing financial framework, not for bitcoin exchanges. But there was a demand for a bitcoin exchange. Who was going to make onee? The less competent of course. The competent ones didnt want to risk anything. Do you understand what im saying?
The regulation made it so mtgox did not have any true competition, there is still problems with a proper exchange. Its still a grey market. However, the ones in existance today seem more competent than mtgox. This is probably because the market have matured, people are more experienced, and have learned from mtgox also.
Bottom line is, the government knocked the feet out under mtgox, and then did nothing. They let it slide into oblivion. Now they use it an example of how if fingerprints and lots of money and various other data was given to the state, somehow there wont be bankruptcies in the exchange market. But it was the US government that took alot of mtgox money to begin with. Just want to point that out.

Can someone TL:DR Why he thinks traditional payment systems are better?
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:04:34
He seems like an uninformed individual. At least that was not a very prudent criticism. Basicially he argues central banks will not allow bitcoin to happen, ignoring the fact its going to be hard to prevent its use, and further more central banks as governments come and go. Technologies stay, governments and their respective rules and laws perish, on a long enough time line. So in this respect, time is with bitcoin. Anyway.
He says that he doesent see bitcoin as a currency, because the people he knows exchanges it to dollars right away. Therefore its not a currency. But thats just an opinion of his. Its not a real argument.

True. But we dont want to throw money at anything. This is wasteful. You are basicially saying if the government spends enough money, eventually something productive will come of it. But this of course negated by the amount of money it had wasted previously and so far, on things that didnt produce anything of value.


About what?
I have no allegience but to science and philosophy, to truth. If it turns out that government lead to economic dysfunction, decay, and rot........ Then so be it, i will not advocate government. How do you feel about this? Would you advocate government, even if it turned out, it was contributing to the detereoation of the economy? What if we took it one step further, would you support government if i could proove it was evil? Would you even be willing to go down that path?

By coordinated attack i assume you mean someone gaining control over several mining pools at once. The probability of that is very small. And if someone were to succeed, the damage would be very temporary. So im not saying there is not a chance, im saying there are other things to worry about

@_date: 2014-07-05 10:10:58
Actually the anti-banks stuff is more interestering to an outsider than "low tx fee" etc. You have to make bitcoin interesting. Low tx fee is not going to make someone care about bitcoin. Actually the reason dogecoin was so succesful was because it was different. It spiked peoples imagniation? I dont know what you call that.
But if you just focus on fees and convenience you are going to bore anyone to death. 
So here are my two-three pitches. Bitcoin is programmable money. Anyone can work with it. Bitcoin is a digital 'product' but cant be copied. World first. Very unique. There are no rules in bitcoin.
 Some may like these ideas, some dont. But it is bound to get someone interested lal.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:15:41
You may be onto something here. There is not a proper bitcoin subscription service. Even for a customer it would be annoying having to xfer bitcoin every month
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:42:18
The rate of newly created bitcoins is not correlated to the willingness of people to spend. If people did expect bitcoin to fall in value they would sell them instead. Rather, people expect it to rise in value, but they still spend it, something which many economists wont have predicted.
@_date: 2014-09-28 06:22:54
There is another aspect to it as well. Rather than bitpay or coinbase transferring the dollars into a bank account, it gets transferred into a paypal account. That is the ecosystem where paypal makes money. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:26:15

@_date: 2014-03-31 03:20:08
I think the idea is transactions fees will make the network able to scale greatly. So you want your transaction to process within the next block? You are basically competering with every other transaction and you need to make sure you provide a proper fee.
What this means is that if there are thousands of transactions per minute, the least important ones will be queued up for later, and the way you define the importance of each transaction is by looking at the fee. Im not sure ive understood it correctly, but this is how i think its supposed to work.
That aside, people continue to innovate, and off-chain transactions is not such a far fetched idea. But it remains to be seen how it will be executed and what kind of cost will be assoicated with it. Fees etc.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:12:57

Bitcoin is designed so no single human can control 51% of the mining power, and even if it got to that point he would have a bigger incentive to keep mining rather than attack the network. Anyway lots of individual miners comprise of ghash.io/cex.io among with their own mining equipment. Remove the individual miners from the equation and its likely they dont even have 25% of the hashing power. Of course thats where they would be left if they stopped mining and started attacking the network instead. Their miners would be furious and switch pools instantly
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:45:21

Does it really matter? I think when it comes down to it politicians have the least influence in politics if you dont have the right opinions. Someone not supporting regs, is meh. The connected etc. can still do what they want. They still get the proper people in charge, in the commissions and so on. And they plan the votes, they time it, they use all the tricks to get their way. A few politicians isnt going to get in their way. 
Basicially i see this a scam

@_date: 2014-06-13 19:39:07
Nah. Actually the 0 fee is just a bonus. What they are really doing is providing 99.99% uptime. DDoS resistant. They merge mine several coins. They do everything the miners want, and its 0% fee. Of course if they stopped merge mining coins, got ddosed, or even started double spending or other shenanigans rather than just chewing through blocks as fast as possible.  Well miners will switch from them, as they would no longer be optimal from a miners perspective

As been said it doesent matter to them. Even if 1 costumer per month purchases with Bitcoin, im sure they still dont lose money. Well maybe if its 1 customer per month only. But i dont see it getting to that point? Also why risk getting bad standing with the bitcoin community that has obviously spent alot of money already with these guys. The only reason for dell and so on to drop bitcoin completely is if the bitcoiners does too, or it becomes illegal. So what would that take? Also even gotta keep in mind that $350 is still a sick price if you look at prices from early 2013 etc.

Why do double spends get easier at 51%? At 51% they could in theory keep mining the longest chain. But they never had 51% of the hashing power. And if they did. Not even for 24 hours. You need more than 51% longer than 24 hours to be able to do a 51% attack since the network grows exponentially atm. and an entity like gigahash.io is not close to being able to pull one off. I mean if they began one, since they are only a mining pool, miners will leave them and they wont be able to succeed, right? They could at most pause the network for a few hours 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:05:50
Well what is authority? It does not have to be violent or violence based
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:44:51
Its likely. There is always a chance. But so far bitcoin is the leader with almost unimaginable amounts of hours and work, and money put into it. There is no reason to switch unless something comes along that is fundamentally better. But do you have any idea? What could fundamentally be better with bitcoin, without it having a negative impact on another aspect of it. For example the confirmation time is often critizced but its important due to bitcoins security. A shorter confirmation time does not make a transaction more secure. Its a long story, but its just one example... Bitcoin is fundamentally sound, and already has the lead, thats why people will continue to build infrastructure for it. By the way i am completely open minded, i am not picking sides. Im just telling it like i see it. Dogecoin is insignificant at the moment, its merely a copy.

Anyway, have a nice day.

@_date: 2014-07-21 15:00:02
I dont think you understand the problem. Regulations drive up costs for running a bitcoin service, for example a wallet significantly. Either entrepenours choose not to make a bitcoin service, make one, pay all the money and comply, or move over seas where the regulations are not in effect. Thats the choices an honest person has.
When it comes to a dishonest one, well its the fucking internet. He can avoid it all together, and make his shady buisness attract customers and screw them anyway. But with regulations the good people cant compete with him, because they have to to spend alot of money on the authorities

You are destroying the trust in bitcoin. Have faith in the incentive structure instead of spreading fud. Ghash.IO got nothing except a nice mining pool miners want to be in, among other things because the pool is honest. If this were to change, miners will leave, the pool will die.

I think the foundation has a meeting with Lawsky and co mid 2013. That sort of gave them a heads up on bitcoin and crypto currency.

It depends on what you mean by obosolete. Im my opinion obsolete is something that is old, something that doesent really work. And needs changing. The state is basicially obsolete because the only reason it is existing is because it has guns. It keeps itself alive via threats etc. to anyone who doesent pay it, and thats what makes it able to exist to a large degree. So it is obsolete, but he reason it is still existing is because people do not dare criticise or avoid paying it.

Anyway, when/if a pool operator abuses peoples trust, they also learn. That will be when miners will think twice about consolidating power under 1 mining pool again. Of course that depends on the damages. I dont foresee a pool operater being able to incur much damage on the network due to the limited power he actually has

Several merge mining options. Makes a difference for people with alot of TH. Miners have stated they like staying with a big pool as the more frequent payouts allows them to maximize profits before next difficulty increase. Dont know the maths behind this, but they said it made a difference as well. Things such as decent web interface, security options, tracking mining progression etc. adds up as well. Possibly some miners just trade their GH on cex.io instead of using it to mine.

If it isnt broke dont fix it. GHash.IO have not caused any significant harm to the network or exchange rate yet. So why all this effort in attempt to fight them?
I get it if any one entity has 51% of the hashing power he could potentially destroy bitcoin, but GHash is not any 1 entity. Miners pool together to mine honestly and share the block rewards. If the pool stops mining honestly, its game over for the pool.
But whatever man. Feel free to donate to p2pool. Its not as harmful as changes to the protocol or preventing pools entirely.

Middle class is where the innovation and competition comes from, lowerclass is where the workers etc. come from. The powerful want a dependant lower class and no middle class if i am correct

People should be very careful with what they are doing. Pooled mining is likely the last option miners have in order to get a steady profit. It means small guys have a chance to be in the race still by pooling together with other small guys. If you take this out of the equation, its likely mining wont be consistent enough for small guys like you and me to be worth it. Imagine having a 100 gh miner. You would never find anything. You would need some serious fucking mining power if you couldnt pool and get shares of the block reward. No-one would do it. So by removing pooled mining, you deliver the network directly in the hands of the rich and powerful. Those kinds of people we dont want to have power over the network. I mean someone with a million dollars would make consistently more than someone with 10,000 dollars invested. You understand what im saying?
I wish people would just calm down. There is not a problem yet, and if gigahash.io turns sour, the miners will leave them, the problem will solve itself

No, since they are a mining pool the amount of hashing power is not concerning. They would never be able to pull off a 51% attack and take the network down for good. As the 51% attack starts, miners begin to leave, eventually their hashrate falls below the threshhold and the attack will stop. But it will never come to that since gigahash.io is about being a super performance mining pool and not a conspiracy on stopping and destroying the blockchain

Maybe they cant keep up with demand. Maybe they cannot get the BTC in time, with the money you gave them, before the BTC price increases. If you want 100% certainty about the price you pay, use exchanges directly.

If you watch the video you will realise war is not funded by taxes, its funded by debt, debt which is only possible because of fiat money. I think the argument goes along the line of if you wanted to pay for the war on terror with bitcoin you would need more than there was in existance. And also when the politicians have to come knock on your door and ask for your money, rather than print it, and force you to pay indirectly, or secretly via inflation, then people are going to demand much more effective government programs. They are going to demand the US end their perpetual war thingie, beause its expensive as fuck.

You should not invest at all then. Petahash is a mining company, and if you dont want them to be part of the best mining pool, ie. if you dont want their hashing power to be utilized as good as possible, why even bother investing?
GHash.IO is a very good mining pool. They have high uptime, DDoS resistant, several merge mining options, and... No fees. Thats what makes them the biggest. If this worries you, you should start or support the competition.
Regardless, GHash.IO enjoys the support they do not because they are the biggest, but because of the factors mentioned previously. If any of this changes, so will their size. That means if they stop behaving honestly, their size and support will reflect this. I mean if they start behaving dishonestly, that will be very good for the competition.

You could look at it that way, but the roots of the problems lie deeper than youd think. What bitcoin solves is with its anti-fragility. It cannot be efficiently stopped or controlled by government. This enables bitcoin to grow inspite of the strict control the government has over the financial sector. May sound surprising to some because the common notion is that the financial sector is free, and can do what they want, but it is, if not the most overseen and controlled part of the economy, by government, then one of the most controlled and overseen part of the economy..
This is why things have become so problematic, there are such huge institutions, and they are rich and powerful as fuck. Tune in tomorrow, for the next episode of government is the root of the problem to find out how bitcoin also solves big government.

cex.io dont really have anything to do with why miners choose ghash tho. It can be argued cex.io make ghash.io just the attractive size initially for miners to notice and try them out. But now cex.io is kind of irrelevant to the succes of ghash.io because it has so much support from 3rd party miners.
Anyway, one of the reasons of the continued success of ghash is the 0% fee. And I think the reason they can do that is because they take money from cex.io to pay for the pools expenses. But im not sure.

That sounds good. But dogecoin is not on a sustainable path, its not nice to advocate it. Bitcoiners dont spread bitcoin because they must otherwise it will fail, they spread it because they think its an important technology with many benefits. Dogecoiners are simply aware that they must keep luring more people in otherwise the concept will fail. Thats kind of evil. When the next halving comes up its going to be extremely hard to make a profit mining unless the price of dogecoin rises significantly, and it just wont. Its a copy, and anything serious is being developed for bitcoin, thats where the value will be created. Im sorry to say, but i dont want people getting into dogecoin and then loosing it all when/if it implodes come next halving

Its best to keep things simple. I would worry about an error in proposed algorithm that could suddenly spew out more bitcoin than anticipated, or less. And if it has to readjust how would you put that into the codebase? Imo if block nr &gt; x then block reward = y ... Its simple and it works. Halvings also cause publicity. I mean, the only one who know the real reason is Satoshi, and im sure there is a good one. Other than that it seems like a minor problem and not something worth changing, in part because of the risk of causing a malfunction..

When it comes to hard forking what the fuck are you on about. If you want to make people trust the system, perhaps you should not suggest a hard fork when there is not even a problem that needs to be solved.

perhaps 1mb is not enough. but bitcoin shouldnt try to become the worlds payment system. i dont think that was the goal to begin with anyway. just to create a digital token that cannot be copied. and bitcoin is this already. if you wanna try to make the blockchain able to handle day to day transactions, i think it will not be possible. and not even neccesary. off-chain transactions can handle this, and off-chain transactors can always proove their reserves via the blockchain. i dont see a problem in this. even end users can use the blockchain in the end. maybe the fee will be $1 or higher. its bound to float. this is why i think there will be wallets that time the transactions, so that if you must use the blockchain, it will make it as cheap for you as possible - by paying when the fee is smallest, but also, possibly grouping the transactions with others, under a shared fee. You know, there is really and endless amount of oppertunities when it comes to scalabilty if you are willing to look at the off-chain aspects. And why wouldnt you?

The only real incentive to switch pool is if it stops doing what you want. For most miners they wsnt to be bart of the biggest cheapest must uptime most merge mined coins pool and so on. They dont care if the total hashing rate above 50% or not. However if the pools begin behaving in a way that affects their income negatively they will have in incentive to switch..

I get much more than 5% discount when i spend bitcoin since i got them for less than what they are currently worth. So not only do you get the discount compared to paying in dollars you also make whatever the currency has appreciated in value since you got it. I dont know if consumers will be able to understand this, but they seem to flock to the phenomenon whenver it starts increasing in value. It creates almost a mania, and it seems like there is no limit to high the exchange rate can go, and thats when alot of people screw up. They think it will continue to increase and never drop so they buy tremendous amounts. Its sad because some people will panic sell just as quickly as they got them, loosing money. But what can you do about that? Thats not really to do with bitcoin but more that most people have no experience with investing basically.
So the benefit of bitcoin is the protection against inflation, its the possible rebate vs. paying with traditional dollars, theres the ease with which you pay someone, and the fact you have absolute control and needent worry about someone reversing the transaction or being able to follow your spending habits with ease.

They have 0 fees to increase the hashing rate. They will find more blocks and will be able to do payouts more frequently. Not larger payouts, but smaller more frequent ones. This is good for people who purchase at cex.io because they want to see results, and they want to see them now, as soon as they purchased gh's. Thats why they offer 3rd party miners to pool for free with the gh's they offer their costumers, because it simply means more blocks found, and therefore more frequent payouts. But from a miners perspective, he doesent neccesarily make more by mining with the largest pool, he just gets the payouts in smaller more frequent intervals.

The chart you linked is based on the amount of BTC passed around right? The link from blockchain.info.
But the way that works is it counts how many BTC are moving, as far as i understand. And if you spend from an adress that has 100 btc in it, but only sent 0.5 btc, the entire 100 btc is counted, for some reason.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:38:47
Its the same thing. If they get compromised, their trust is gone, and along with it 3rd party miners. (By the way have a mining pool ever been compromised yet?). Even if you believe there is a problem what are you going to do about it? There are alot of people screaming, but what are you going to do about it? People are already making pull requests and comming up with all kinds of shit and changes to the protocol because of a problem that doesent even exist, that is exactly how you create actual problems. Gigahash.io has not done any significant harm yet, we just have to trust them. And if they get compromised, or turn bad themselves, they loose the trust, and along with it alot of hashing power. Come on, your the bitcoin-ceo you must be able to see through the fud. Or are you also part of the panic inducing crowd. I should have joined them, and bought bitcoins for cheap.

In other words: Charlie pays his protection money. Nah im just kidding. I have no idea what im talking about
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:39:33
Cant you see how you are contradicting yourself?
It is not in the individual miners interest to attack the network. This requires mining in secret, building a long chain before anyone else finds a block. That is risky, because you are could end up with an orphaned block or several all of a sudden. Furthermore attacking the network is going to decrease the value of what miners are after, namely bitcoin further disincentivising an attack.
So i dont know what you are talking about. What is this common resource that will be destroyed if it is an individual miners benefit to exploit it?
Your example would make sense if the exchange rate began declining because ghash.io reached 51% and miners kept with the big pool. But the exchange rate didnt tank. There was no tragedy. 
So where are you getting this from?
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:21:55
What would you define as high   volume? Aren't average no. Of transactions higher than ever? We don't know the true no.

I throw up a little in my mouth when hear government agencies talk about consumer protection. They have no idea what bitcoin is. They havent cared about it for the 5 or so years it has existed. 2-3 years ago bitcoin was different. You didnt have the same kind of security on the exchanges, you didnt have the same kind of robust wallets. I mean this is only the beginning, and while everyone is busy improving the user experience of bitcoin. Government is talking about how they ought to provide us some "consumer protection" some time. Fawk those guys:) Wanna help? Do it now. And dont think you can make some kind of law that is magically going to make everything better. you cant. Laws are shit. They hardly work in the real world, when it comes to the digital world, they work even less lol. OH IN CASE YOU DIDNT NOTICE. IT IS FORBIDDEN TO MURDER, STEAL, FRAUD, SELL DRUGS, ETC. But it still happens everywhere. It would be terrible if the government went away with its laws because then things would turn into jungle law. Everyone would steal from each other so on, so on. Nah. Fuck that. If government stopping getting in the way there would be much better, effective, peaceful! solutions to crime etc. But as long as the jerks with pens and paper think they can change the world with those items..... Well yea. Nothing is going to happen. Nothing productive at least.
Actually i am bit wrong. The government officials for lack of a better term dont just have a pen and paper. They have THUGS, who go around and roughen people up who defy what is written on this paper. Called Laws..
Im so sick and tired of government and their do-good mentality. They make it seem like they are absolutely neccesary, but they cause nothing but trouble. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:52:15
Welcome. Thank you for asking the question. Now prepare to enter the rabbit hole.
Basicially corruption, taxation, asset forfeiture especially the latter two are just other ways of describing theft. The government is a criminal institution, if it was susceptible to its own laws. If you do not pay tax, they will throw you in prison, if you do not go to prison, they will drag you, if you do not let them drag you, ie. arm yourself, barricade yourself, they will kick down the door, and probably shoot to kill you, if you defend yourself. This is legitimate. However if any other person tried to extort someone for money like this. They would be seen as a criminal.
So how does bitcoin end taxation, asset forfeiture, and the corruption that springs up around it. Wel, the government is a big institution. This is due to central banking, and the ability to create money out of thin air. All these people, this police, and sometimes military, that does the governments bidding, needs money. Normally you tax people, but when government is such a size it is today, you cannot tax people to get the money. The tax burdon would be too big, people would rebel. So instead money is created out of thin air, and loaned to the government, thats how its able to afford taxation, corruption, asset forfeitures, and all the other stuff it does. Thats how its so big. Bitcoin changes this, because its sound money. The government cannot manipulate it per say. They cannot get it easily, and therefor the government has to be more sound as well......

I would be using bitcoin even if a pool had 70% of the hashing power. And i think you will too. 
The equivalent is like saying if a big exchange goes bankrupt, steals clients money or something similar, you will leave bitcoin. I dont think you will.
Miners will run on the pool that suddenly starts acting malicious. It might cause a little inconvenience, but nothing similar to what happened when gox cracked. However what comes after is something even stronger and more secure. We've seen it over and over again in bitcoin.

Its still decentralized even if there are several payment processors/wallets/banks etc. but you could still use the blockchain if you wished. I imagine the fees would be high because the tx queue clogs up, that off-chain transactions would be a better option most of the time. Of course its only speculation. Also a blockchain transaction is in theory worth more than an off-choin one, so it could become more expensive as well. Only theory. But its possible.

The blockchain will not be used for micro payments, miner fees are expected to increase in the future, and there is also a limit to how many tx can be done via the blockchain per day. When the limit starts being reached, the miner fees are going to increase, i presume, because some people will want to be in the next first block. Some people will need confirmation asap, while others can wait. The people who need confirmations asap, pay a higher fee than those who can wait. So, in the future, the transactions you see on the blockchain are going to become larger and larger, imo. Certainly, micro transactions arent going to be economical. And this is actually a good thing, its not something that can change. I dont see how. Even if the block size is raized, or something is done to scalablity, the blockchain will never be able to accomodate micro tx, or even day to day tx of a small country imo. This kind of scalability needs to be found in off-chain solutions, and-or alt coins although that would be a little awkward.

The difference between a market based solution and a government one is it takes years, sometimes decades and dometimes the error is never undone at all when it comes to government solutions.

why would they do this? i dont think any signifcant percantage of their readers have bitcoin to spend. i even think paywalls are a dying buisness model, not many pay for information on the internet anymore?

Maybe bitcoin is not meant for micro transactions over the blockchain. Maybe thats something a 3rd party payment provider will have to manage. It makes sense too, imo, since the software etc. to open up for an article have to be maintained as well.

Because more and more things are becomming illegal to buy, and companies like master-card just obeys. There are things such as drugs to 'zen' magnets that are illegal to sell, and if you want to buy these things or sell, you need an anonymous way to transact because the traditional payment companies will report you to the governments and have you sent to jail so to speak.

Bitcoin would still be around. But to be honest bitcoin depends on the current financial system. You need to do bank transfers typically to an exchange to get bitcoin, i mean you need cash. If an economic disaster presents itself and banks close or you are unable to wire money to exchanges etc. of course that means bad for bitcoin. But it will still be around, and it might be so that people to choose to use that as money instead, if the current financial system ends up shutting down

What we should worry about is when a large pool suddenly stops finding blocks. Then they may be attempting a doublespend or worse. Although i dont see why they would, miners instantly notice, and if the attack succeeds miners are going to be even more furios. They will switch pool

What if bitcoin pooling is able to proove the econonic theory of natural monopolies. It is already testing the deflation myth i dont see how it could also be revolutionary when it comes to the stance on natural monopoly. So what is natural monopoly. In this case its ghash.io they are the best pool therefore many miners big and small choose them. Now due to their size they can easier attack the network. It is commonly percieved that they will, because, well there is no ventral authority that tells them not to. However its not a given they will act maliciously. And we might be able to exist with a popular mining pool with &gt;50% hashing power

The incentive structure that Satoshi put in place in order to keep the network going, doesent change with pooling. You always had to trust a majority of the miners would be honest, and that is still the case. However, we have been lucky in that double spends are not a daily occurence. I think there are much less double spends than Satoshi expected. 
So with pooling, if doublespends become more mainstream, that is what the confirmations are for. Right now we are at Defcon 0. You can literately accept 0 confirmation deposits, especially irl, without having to really worry. However, 1 confirmation deposits are infinitely more secure and each confirmation you wait for makes the transaction that much secure.
I mean. I dont understand you concern

As far as i understand, one does not simply run bitcoin core and voila you have a full node. You need to configure your router/firefall to make sure it accepts connections on bitcoin default port. I dont know if there is more to in that that, but if you end up setting up a node, and not being able to make enough connections, you are not helping the network, but rather harming it, thats how i understood it.

I think people are mistaken. Riding a drama train. GHash.IO is not a threat, since they got nothing except a really nice pool miners want to mine in. One of the reasons being they are honest.

There are afterall a handful alternatives, and they are not *that* bad.

What do you mean by organised, and what do you mean by disorganised for that matter? Decentralized defense, ie. militias can be very effective. There have been numerous battle's in history where few people have fought of many. And probably even more battles have been completely avoided because even tho they had vastly more manpower, they wouldnt risk taking a town or whatever the fuck, because the casualties would be too large.
Germany invaded Denmark in second world war, it was over fast. They took control over the taxation system etc. right. Everything was already in place and the danes were already disarmed. Switzerland for example remained neutral, and that is likely due to the population being armed. A foreign power, as powerful as germany couldnt afford to go house to house to get a few taxes. It was easier to just trade and negotiate with them.

I am in doubt. Ive been following bitcoin closely for about 1½ year. It has been a very bullish time frame. From sub $100 to $600. Its hard to say wether this price level is justified. 
I am certain that bitcoin is here to stay, but i think its likely there will be a run sooner or later. There have been a few runs already, and i know people everywhere have been buying in 2014.

This is a weak argument. Im not sure there is any. Pyramid schemes are everwhere. The food quality is terrible. Everyone is fat. What you are trying to say? Is that the governments fault, or is it just because it hasnt done enough? Notice fat people is a very recent thing, and you mention that governmetn 'recently' started making a big presence in the area (and it does.) i think the various departments for food health etc. are better funded than ever, and there are more rules when it comes to food production than ever. Yet there are more fat and unhealthy people than ever. But thats because the government is not doing enough you will probably say. But what has the government done where things have actually turned out to be better? Is it the police? Crime is low? Is it the war on drugs? Drugs are very hard to come by? Is it the war on poverty?

Force everyone to use a specific denomination. The change will be fast, and the problem 'solved'. The market is a bit slower, but the solution is better, and there is room for improvement. With the politician and his law, it may be the wrong denomination, and changing the law will be difficult.

Use force and initiate force is not the same thing. Iniating violence is different from using violence to defend against someone initiating violence. Right?
If that is the case a militia will not be a government since a government has the legal right to iniate violence, a militia or self-defense squads or whatever.. I think milita is a bad word. Anyway militias purpose are to use violence to defend a given area/population. Not iniate violence against them in order to solve a social problem. In this case that is what buisnesses and individuals do through negotation and invention, trade etc. Peaceful means.

You didnt properly demonstrate how mining is 'destroying' bitcoin. I assume your argument is the price is falling because there is less demand than there is supply. This could be for a number of reasons, and it has happened several times before. Bitcoin is not a one way trip to get rich quick land. Its 90% market based, and as such, kind of brutal. Anyway
I dont understand how changing the algorithm to favor only GPU's or CPU's is going to change the mining scope. For the problem is not, as far as i can tell, we cant get asics, its that there are asic farms outhere who are proffesional, and exceptional at upgrading capacity, and mining all that sweet coin. These farms will still exist, wether it was CPU, GPU or whatever mined. And i dont see how its a problem. Mining was not intended to distribute coins, at least its not neccesary. Coins can ge distributed by any number of ways, and people are doing it all the time. Mining on the other hand is intended to secure the network, and in return they get some coin. That is kind of clever........
Regarding the supply &amp; demand, obviously since the exchange rate is declining there have been less demand than supply and it could be for a number of reasons. It has happened before, and bitcoin has 'returned' with new strength every time. I dont think its right blaming this on mining, at least you didnt do a good job of explaining why.

I dont know. I imagine there will be several payment processors, and i imagine you wouldnt really know which one you used. Right now there is bitpay, coinbase, bips/coinify and many others if you want to accept bitcoin but get fiat. When it comes to payment processing and of-chain tx's im sure there will be several as well, if government regulation does not corner the market. And i dont think you will ever be able to have the blockchain accomodate 'world trade'. It is much better with a decentralized version so to speak where day to day stuff does not get in there.

Cex.io is the cloud mining, gigahash.io is the pool. Get your facts/terms straight.
You said cex.io as a single entity represented 25% of the hashing power in ghash.io, thats what, 10PH? That means theyd have to add at least 50PH within a short time frame in order to have a majority of the hashing power. Thats not going to happen.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:32:17
Miners pooling together to share block rewards does not equal centralization. It may look like it on the surface but miners are still interested in mining honestly, and they will find another pool if their current one stops that. What you are seeing is lack of competition and it happens all the time. As soon as ghash will have competetent competitors miners can spread out more. Ie. this is  more likely than not a temporary situation. Ghash is a pool with 30% of the hashing rate? It may grow, or it may shrink, it depends on the competition. Regardless what miners are looking for is an honest pool, unless they can earn more by being dishonest, and so far this isnt an option. You earn less if you try to game the system.

Would you be willing to accept if purse.io was indeed a platform for people with stolen credit cards to monetize them? I doubt this. But since there are probably other people reading i will continue the conversation...
You are claiming that the people fulfilling wishlists on purse.io are legitimate people wanting to purchase bitcoin legitimately. Yet their buy bitcoin feature is complicated. Its bad for buying bitcoin with a credit card. This is counter intuitive to why people look to use a credit card to begin with. Purse.io does not make it easy, you have to sift through orders, and more often than not wait for one that is realistic. Ie. no more than 10% above spot. Then you have to go to amazon and set up his info, delivery adress etc, pay, wait/and hope! the bitcoin is released from escrow to you. In spite of this, orders get fulfilled all the time. Come on. Dont tell me this is by innocent people just wanting bitcoin.

I guarantee you if a pool begins acting maliciously the problem will solve itself, since miners will leave it, the pool ops know this. Thats why they wont risk it. Rather than comming up with changes to the protocol which are some pretty complicated solutions so far... likely with unintended consequences.. The "problem" should be solved by competing with GHash.IO so miners have an equally good alternative. 
The problem really is that people are uninformed. Miners dont mine at GHash because they are the biggest, they mine with GHash because they are the best. A mining pool is not just about having alot of the hashing power. Its about being big enough and being superb on various other key areas, such as low fee (GHash is free.) High uptime, DDoS resistant, connections with good nodes, sleek webinterface and so on..... Oh and merge mining, which makes a considerable difference for people with alot of TH. I dont think it is a coincidence that GHash.IO enjoys the most hashing power, and they also offer the most merge mining. The largest players simply choose them over any other, even tho they might want to mitigate to another pool. But there is currently no viable alternatve..

I think Petamine has been exploring joining p2pool network, but reluctant due to lack of merge mining etc. This guy try to solve it.

Coinbase dont need to inspect the source code in this case. The developer is not a random guy. He has had ties with Coinbase founders since before Coinbase.

Basicially in the financial world there is alot of regulation. I wouldnt lie if i said only a handful knew what was legal and what wasnt. Basically CEX.io operates like a financial entity in that they rent out their hashing power via contracts and let peple daytrade them. its not a direct rent, its done via a financial instrument so to speak, and offering financial instruments is generally a big no-no if you do not have the approval of government.

Yes and no. Retail currently works fine with the more or less high credit card fees. Its not unlikely a company will set up their off off-chain environment for quick and secure bitcoin transactions, for a little fee. But just out of the box the blockchain is not going to be able to provide for retail. I think 1 walmat has tens of thousands of transactions per day. This would quikcly bloat the blockchain. There is a requirement for 3rd party services imo.

I dont understand what law can garner more trust and security than what the market can come up with. There is also the problem of securing the people who make the laws. There is no way to guarantee they wont begin serving special interests. The catch is the laws can mitigate the damage so to speak, everyone will be siphoned of some economic value and probably wont notice, but it will be given to a few powerful players who likes it alot. The other way around, where the market deals with the problem, the damages are instant and the recovery is fast, the damage is also localized to people who were involved in the specific incident. Think Mtgox. Bitcoin economy as whole has recovered tbh, but few people involved are still on the hook for lost btc etc.
All in all, i dont understand why people are proponents of government regulation - i have an idea, but i dont know for certain - never the less, i believe its a cancer that we need to take a principled stance towards, if we want to make any productive progress toward a better functioning society........... By the way i think people support government simply because its part of the culture. People are scared to believe government may be wrong, and would rather try to rationalize or excuse its existence and in turn their core belif on the matter, rather than explore the actual facts behind it and figure out the truth.

I feel most transactions can be settled of chain without a prob. When you need anonymity, or absolute certainty ie. non reversability, the blockchain could be preferrred. I imagine that some payment processer wil do non reversible off chain transactions. I mean, settled once every 24h or so via the blockchain. There will certainly be times when the blocks are more crowded than others, and these payment processors would settle the bitcoin amounts owed when there is least activity on the blockchain. Nevertheless, i am interested to see what happens when the blockchain gets crowded and there will be actual competition to get in first block comming up. This competition is going to mean floating fee. The guy who pays the most gets confirmed first. This is what im hoping will happen. I dont believe bitcoin should even attempt to become a one size fit all payment system for the entire world...... Thats crazy:)

I believe that blockchain transactions are going to become expensive in the future. Expensive compared to none-blockchain transactions. Because the whole mining thing that is setup to process the transactions, and protect the integrity of the blockchain and so on, is very resource intensive, compared to other payment mechanisms. On top of that, the way bitcoin is designed, there can only be so many transactions per minute. Right now, i think the limit is around 2500 every 10 minute, because of the blocksize limit. You can increase the limit, you can maybe double it, or triple it, but you still end up with a rather limited amount of transactions per minute, compared to how many transactions there might be, if "everyone" is to be using bitcoin and blockchain transactions. Basically the way i see it, the miner fee you pay, is more of a bid, than a fee. The highest bidders, get in the first block, and so on. Now i am not an expert at all, and dont quote me on this tbh. but i think these things put together are going to push up the tx fee, and this makes blockchain transactions relatively expensive and unfit for small day to day transactions so to speak.

I think it does. People in the pool can trade their GH on cex.io. And cex. can do with the pool what they want. For example add merge mine any coin without asking for whatever pool they were in instead to adopt it. Also they can keep the fees low by having their own pool. Oh and their payouts are very frequent, something i imagine people buying cloudmining likes. It is to their benefit to be in a very large pool

I think where you go wrong is by equating every miner with the miners of p2pool. Besides what do the miners stand to loose in this case, they are not really being defrauded. The pool states it has x percent of hashing power, fee and so on. The miners agree to this and all is good, right? The only difference is some may not be aware that they arent part of the real p2pool network, but they probably dont care that much anyway.
Of course a good statist would use the situation to make a real boogey man out of p2pool and convince the 'victims' and the onlookes how evil p2pool is. The result would be a government program that is suppose to approve pool names, it would take several weeks and have hundreds of employees and there would be a special pool tax to pay for it. All just so people dont happen sign up for a pool, that never lied about its stats and terms, but appeared to be another one

The biggest pool do not have a competitive advantage unless it is better than the competition. Lets say GHash.IO introduces a 2% fee. They may be the biggst but they are suddenly the most expensive now. That makes the competition look more appealing. There are many other examples, but bottom line is miners do not seek the biggest pool, they seek a pool that is big enough and performs strongly on key areas such as up time, latency, fees, DDoS protection, web-interface, ease of setup etc...

That's kind of the point. You learn from errors as well. It being from your own or others. The point is to grow smarter and that is through trial and error roughly spoken. Where do you think innovation and motivation to solve problems come from? Look at the growth of bitcoin. It's because we are all exposed to the problems, scams and what not. It starts an unstoppable force (government can slow it) that works toward solving these problems and making bitcoin life easier. You think the government can make the bad guys disappear? That is naive. The bad guys will exist under a regulatory system and the more money they have, the easier time they will have. Hello legacy banking system and it's crony bankers.

Its not erratic. But it is swinging freely. Some would argue this is a benefit for bitcoin, as people who trade, take to the phenomenon, giving it "purpose" initially. I mean, some could argue, that if the price was 100% stable, the phenomenon would be much less known and cared about at this point.

You are creating a problem that doesent exist. Ghash.IO has not been consistently above 50%, they have not been consistently double spending or attacking the network. There is no reason to loose faith in the decentralized nature of bitcoin. Only when/if a pool gets consistently above 50% starts attacking the network without miners leaving it, may we have a problem. But its not going to happen. Being a successful pool operator is a lucrative buisness, they wont turn on the network, and even if it does, the hit on the miners income will make them leave the pool

The market is not perfect, but neither is the government. Even if government regulation were to be good in 1 case, there are so many cases where it has caused harm.
The market is able to quickly adapt, and it has been good at it over the years. People care about the environment and as we get richer (because of the effectiveness of the market) we get more money to look after the environment. Its no wonder that 50 years ago there was probably less cared about the environment, because first of all, there wasnt really any money to take care of it. For example consumers or end users couldnt afford to choose the more envrionmentally friendly way... There is also the problem of technology. Probably technology werent there to properly care for the envirionment. So just to reiterate, the market is not perfect, and niether is the government, but the market is better overall because it develops the prosperity and technology to take proper care of the environment.

There will always be problems, question is if we will have less or more with a free market. There is certainly alot of problems today, and the government has alot of control over the economy. Id say its worth a shot at least to seperate government and economy. For example in china the government made special economic zones where they tried a truer version of capitalism (with free'er markets) than the west currently pursues, and its one the major factors leading to its economic growth

At least not everyone is able to do this, and the people who do, merely see an oppertunity to let the price fall as low as possible, for cheap bitcoin. Sorry. Another long post..

Why? A pool being vastly better than the competition should not concern you. Until competition improves, its possible a pool will have &gt;50% market share. Same thing happened with mtgox. The competition was slow, and mtgox ended up having alot of market share. But people left when they started showing signs of trouble... The same thing is going to happen with ghash. miners are going to leave if there are signs of trouble. Those who stay will only be hurting themselves by wasting hashing power on the pool admins shenanigans.

It is relatively trivial to make a centralized or offchain bitcoin transaction system, the hard part is getting the trust as the transactor. But thats not even that hard if your goal is to become trust worthy. Inputs.io had off.chain transactions, and it was working. The owner wasnt trustworthy tho. I mean, some of the first exchanges in bitcoin dont even exist anymore, better versions, more trustworthy etc. replaced them. In fact, an exchange is one big off-chain transactor one could argue. Person A and Person B transacts bitcoin between each other on these. Finally settled in stone, so to speak, when a withdrawal is made. Yadda yadda...
@_date: 2014-08-08 07:21:53
It would seem spending is declining as the exchange rate of bitcoin does, contrary to a common economic belief which would have predicted people would be spending more. On the other hand, when the exchange rate was rising, spending also seemed to pick up, which also contraficts the common belief regarding deflation, which would have predicted people wouldnt spend under such conditions. Thanks for some data:)

What we should be aiming for is something that could destroy big government. Because, in the end, this is destroying the economy, and allowing for things like ebay/paypal. Its a long story. But bitcoin can potentially curtail one of governments biggest sources of power, the central bank and cheap credit. Without it, politicians would have to be much more careful with the money etc. This way you wont have all kinds of departments micro managing every aspect of the economy, there simply wont be money for it. That way the economy would be more competitive, and people would have more choice, it would make for less 'lazy' big companies, and more streamlined, costumer focused ones, basicially...

The short answer is greed and ignorance. The long answer is that people were sending money to mtgox when bitcoin withdrawals stopped, and the exchange rate plumeted. They were gambling bitcoin withdrawals would be enabled again, and they would have some cheap bitcoin then. It worked the other way around too, when gox was 10,15,20 dollars higher than other exchanges people were sending bitcoin there, selling them, probably hoping the fiat withdrawals problems would disappear and they would have made a few extra dollars per bitcoin. Some, alot? choose not to gamble and switched to alternative exchanges when mtgox first started showing signs of trouble. That was all the way back to middle of 2013 iirc. 
But who wants these regulations? Who is going to make the rules? Who even knows what rules are appropriate? Id say if you let the market do its job, which i doubt government will, its practically the opposite of the market, the two are more or less enemies, then it will sort the bad from the good. But the market has not been allowed to properly work with bitcoin because of the expensive licenses, unclear regulations and what not, and here we are, 5 years after bitcoins birth, and it still struggless with these grey market prectices etc. If there was a place on earth where entrepenours could hook into the current financial system without having to worry about regulations etc. They will be able to build some of the awesomest exchanges there will ever exist. But until then, we will have to manage with these hacks, heists and various other problems, because proper bitcoin exchanges are being kept away by government regulations.

He has alot on the line to be honest. He is not going to become a criminal and steal everyones coins. How could he anyway?

Do you mean my comment is juvenile? I dont think so. I apologise if i have offended you. But i think if you want the government involved your going to end up with bigger problems than this. I mean only people who chose to keep money with gox are affected, this is different from when government steps in and makes rules for everyone. Take for example the current regulation. KYC,AML,ETC.
That is causing problems for the entire bitcoin community because its trying to manage i dont even know what the purpose of KYC and AML is... But its making it difficult for people to exchange and develop the btc economy freely.
So now we are going to have an arbitrary rule that says No insider trading. I wonder how that is going to work. It would be better if people stopped being so greedy that they end up hurting themselves financially. Because lets face it you should have been gone from mtgox a long time ago.

A mining pool doesent have to be that big in order to become attractive for a big player. BTC guild, Discus fish, even eligius are big enough. What matters more, is the merge mining options, uptime, security, ease of use, low fees etc.
There currently exist no barriers for a challenger to arise. I know coinbase are speculating in starting a mining pool. These things just take time. And thats a good thing. Rushed decisions, such as changes to the protocol often lead to unintended consequences. I am basically a proponoent of letting the market solve this(!) and not the devs. In the end having the devs attempt to limit pools is centralization in a way anyway......... Kind of a stretch, but this problem is not solved by having devs limit the success of individial pools. 
The problem is best solved by having a competitor arise, so miners can spread out, which they have expressed they want to, but currently the most optimised pool is ghash with their low fees, multiple merge mining options and so on...
So where is that competitor? Maybe it already exists, miners just havent discovered it yet. But they will in time. And if GHash turns malicious, it will only accelerate the mitigation.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:35:35
The only reason you will bring this up is because believing government is not neccesary is a scary thought. I dont blame you .Because thats basically what we are indoctrinated to think. Its not something you can discuss with people.
However, if you really believe that we cannot do without government, IE. bitcoin would not have happened if it werent for literately stealing money from people and giving to researchers... I mean, thats far out.

Please. Im not a fan of calling regulation regulation. External regulation sounds harmless, thats the only way you can build a case for it. But regulation in reality is violence. Probably sounds far out if you havent heard it before. But its basically a bunch of people telling you what you can or cannot do, if you dont abide, they throw you in jail. This is probably the worst idea if you want to make something durable. Because what happens is, the people who make these rules, will make rules for their own benefit. Its monopoly 101.
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:51:16
It depends what you mean by country. In order for bitcoin to really take off in an economy there needs to be little regulation. If this is the approach the government takes, its likely it did so in other areas as well. In that case these areas will be growing too which reflects positively on GDP. Ie. i dont see a government turning around and saying we will not restrict bitcoin buisneses, while keeping a tight grip around the rest of the economy. Its either or. I dont know about the situation in the phillipines. But for some reason we hear alot about it in this subreddit. Maybe its not just bitcoin that is growing in the phillipines but other areas of the economy as well.

They seem to work fine for most things


How do you know? Creating room for more transactions does not mean there will be more transactions. What if a viable off-chain transaction system is established and people start using that? Then you may end up with a deserted blockchain, except for the people who need to avoid censorship, or otherwise prefer using the blockchain - But who would? It is clunky compared to an off-chain solution. Just look at how easy it is for me to tip you bitcoin via 100 bits . If i had to figure out your bitcoin adress first, and so on, i probably wouldnt do it. Do you get what i mean? There is a demand for an off-chain payment system you just dont know it yet. People will use this system for their mainstream purchases. People just dont realise it yet, because it doesent exist. But if you think about it the off-chain systems will be superior because they are much more flexible. What they lack in irreversability they make up for in convenience.

because this is the top comment, you wont see $266 and the next bubble is just around the corner. the market usually does the opposite of what people expect, and thats because when people expect a bear market, and they realise its actually a bull, they react on feelings, and they will fuel this bull thing until it becomes an epic rally and they loose all senses and just pile more money onto it. Does that make sense? It probably doesent,
tl;dr, when bear, dispair etc. is the popular belief. Expect the opposite to be the case in the near future (this is comming from someone who has been downvoted for months for predicting this price level :))

If bitcoin was inflationary it would have never taken off. Money does not need to loose value over time in order to faciliate trade, in fact no-one lists that as a requirement when defining money. The thing about deflating money or money that increases in value is it per definition makes its holders richer and thereby able to consume

And so far i dont think you have to. If gigahash.io begins a 51% attack it will stop almost immidiately since miners will leave and they will loose  hashing power.
When it comes to double spends, you can wait for confirmations. Often 1 confirmation is enough to protect you from double spends. If it becomes known that gigahash.io has been attempting double spends by timing their blocks they will also loose crucial trust. But if you are a miner you might want to consider using the next best pool, just to calm people the hell down. Actually no dont. Let them get use to 1 pool finding &gt;50% of the blocks in the day

Well. Its nice and all. But why do they think they have a chance? As long as regulators exist, they will regulate, and bitcoin is their new thing. There is no way anyone can make them stop regulating bitcoin. All they can do by going around and lobbying is showing them bitcoin and thus giving them the oppertunity to regulate it early, which is what. we. dont. want.
Basicially its like this "Hey have you heard about bitcoin?" its this really new phenomenon thats in its early stages, and experienceing alot of trial and error. What you dont want is to regulate it because that would be bad. We have to make sure the trial and error progress stays intact so the market, consumers and buisnesses can grow stronger. So that particular part of the economy can grow. Ok mr. regulator? This what bitcoin is, this is what it needs, and you shouldnt be part of it. Who thinks this is a good idea? Who thinks explaining and talking about bitcoin with someone who you dont want part of it is a good idea? What you want to do is let the regulators be occupied with wall-street, mean while bitcoin is taking the world by storm.

Ha. I left too much unsaid. Bitcoin has anarcho-capitalists roots more or less, and they go by the non-aggresion principle. They understand the nature of government and take a moral stance against it. Basically government = force/violence and therefor they cannot get behind it. Being against violence, you may also be against UFC imo, since thats also just about violence. I dont see why you couldnt be ancap, or for the non-aggression principle and not like UFC tho. But UFC is more about violence than anything else, so as an ancap it would be odd to like it, imo. Also the reason ancaps get behind bitcoin is because they recognize that only through central banking, ie. the Fed does the government have the power/financial ability to mobilise troops and wage war years and years on end overseas, as well as establish para military police, checkpoints and what not at home and so on. Basically bitcoin acts as an alternative or perhaps replacement of The Fed, and therefore a reduction in the governments ability to be as omnipotent as it is today. (To reitirate.. using violence to solve social problems causes unintended consequences or makes the situation worse, however that is what government does:/)

Double spending affects the victim the most. It is decentralized damage so to speak. But to be honest it would damage gigahash.io the most, since miners would be actively seeking an alternative pool in this case.

I think a reason to get bitcoin then, if not for any of the things you mentioned, just as an investment. Maybe bitcoin will go to 0, that sucks, maybe it will go to 10k. Good for you. You know what im saying?
Wether or not it will have use for a majority of people in the future depends on the degree to which the government begins censoring financial transactions. Bitcoin is very censorship resistant. This is why it has potential, as it can be used to avoid the governments controls and what not. Maybe not neccesary now, but it may be neccesary in the future. I do believe things can change pretty quick, all it takes is another financial crisis, or some kind of catastrophe and the government is going to move in, and clamp down on peoples freedom to transact. This is where bitcoin can become a valuable asset. If you still dont blieve in any of this, or its not going to happen, well, i guess, bitcoin is not for you? But dont tell me i didnt tell you so! :)

Pools make for a more decentralized market. It allows a new miner, anywhere basically, to start small, get only fractions of the block reward, then eventually reinvest in bigger and bigger equipment. If it wasnt for pools, it would be significantly harder getting into mining, and the network would likely be smaller and grow at a much slower rate. If it wasnt for pools billionaires could really have their way with bitcoin. But pooling lowers the barrier of entry, and its good for the entire network.

@_date: 2014-06-20 11:33:05
Well what i find strange is why he didnt say government did it from the beginning. Was he scared? Was he advised not to by lawyers?
In any case the US government did confiscate about 5 millions dollars from mtgox accounts at Dwolla and ~~Western Union~~ Wells Fargo. And immidately after that, people started reporting withdrawal delays on fiat. It kind of climaxed when mtgox announced they would stop all fiat withdrawals for 14 days, not citing any specific reason. But i think they were simply out of fiat, because of the governments actions. Rather than going belly up, they decided to take the chance and wait for people to deposit more fiat, so they could start paying that out to others who requested it. Never the less it didnt work, since mtgox already had competent competitors and people began choosing them instead. Anyway i think that lead to the decision of doing fractional bitcoin reserves in order to save the ship. However that didnt work either and they were eventually forced to declare bankruptcy. 
However it seems the government threw them of course to begin with, but they never mentioned it officially for some reason............. Perhaps in hindsight mtgox should have played nicer with the authorities, paid attention to the law, AML, KYC and so on. Then the situation could be avoided. But who actually knows about this? I mean maybe he should have been seeking proffesional help much sooner, and the exchange could still be alive today. Its hard to say who is at fault, but it looks like the US gov seizure/freezing of funds was the kick off of mtgox demise.

I guess what you are trying to say is that Coinbase will somehow benefit if they throttle payments to bitpay, make them seem slow? Wouldnt that cause unncessecary stress on coinbase customer support, as well as bitpay support perhaps. And wouldnt it cause the reputation of coinbase wallet to damage. I mean, having a reputation of a slow wallet is not good for coinbase. So i assume it is in coinbase priority to make sure transactions are pushed as fast as possible, if not instantly, regardless of where the money is going?

The answer is they dont have to bear the cost in the end. Politicians making decisions that only benefit in the short term do not bother them if they are not around for the long term. G.W Bush didnt care that Afghanistan had a chance to turn into a 13 year occupation. Hes not around any more.
Its the same with corporations, although a little different. First of all management is not personally liable for the bad decisions they make, the corporation is. That means the shareholders, often lower level employees and so on who get laid of. The upper management is shielded, thats why they can take bigger risks, and make bad decisions, IE. pursue short term gains at the expensive of long term ones.
When it comes to bitcoin, and specifically mining pools the situation is completely different. If the mining pool decides to perform dishonest activities it is going to make the competition look better at that very moment. The mining pool will hurt itself immidiately and even long term.

What about blockchain bloat? Why dont we stick to the 1mb limit. 20mb will not be enough at some point either. The blockchain will never be able to scale, it will never be able to encompas any significant amount of transactions, so why are some people trying to make it? It should not be used to buy coffées or tip each other. The market will  solve these problems (look at changetip, off-chain tipping), where the blockchain and the miners will act to audit bitcoin reserves when needed- at a transaction fee, which ideally is based on supply and demand. - as well as censorship resistant transactions. 1mb or 20mb are arbitrary numbers in the end. May as well keep it at 1 and keep blockchain size growth to a minimum and allow the market to come up with the scalable solutions.

It is a net loss however, because where wasnt demand for such a person before, there was money for something else. Saving up, investing, expanding the buisness. In the end the bill is passed to the consumer and what is the point? They want to limit money laundering etc. this regulation will not have any effect on this since bitcoin is decentralized and exists on the internet. It cant be regulated, money launderers will find a way. So basically the regulations make companies throw money out the window, fork the bill to the consumer, and the consumer will end up with less money to spend on things he actualyl want/need. Thats jobs destroyed.

I was thinking the other day about how bitcoins deflationary nature is a lie. Well, it is until 2032 when block rewards will be less than a bitcoin.  Come that point, even sooner, transaction fees must be covering miner, or else i think a significant portion of the miners are going to stop.
So whats going to happen is, at some point blockchain transaction costs are going to have to rise, and people dont like that. Look at the restistance toward not raising the block size. I think why most people are fundamentally against it is because they realise they will have to pay to do a blockchain transaction. They dont want that. So there is going to be demand for keeping up the inflation rate and keep increasing the blocksize so that miners will be subsidized and people can do transactions free of charge so to speak.
Wether or not the devs will have the strength to argue for transaction fees will tell. There is alot more to it than that tho.

This is true. But would you be in favor of keeping an inflation rate of 25 BTC every 10 minutes? I think this kind of statement is dangerous. If the devs ever announced that bitcoin will continue to inflate at a set rate for ever the price could plummet and a sounder crypto could eventually take over.
What im trying to say is if you want to keep the transaction costs artifically low you wil have to keep rewarding miners with newly minted coins. If you keep minting coins, you risk people abandoning bitcoin for a crypto currency that has a fixed supply.

The thing about BU is it doesent just require the miners, so even if 75% of miners signal they are ready or 95% it still cant activate because it also requires nodes and an economic majority of some sort.

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:57:49
Thats only if you define bitcoins full potential as X transactions per second. In order for bitcoin to reach its potential off-chain transactions are going to be used more. Keep in mind that services like changetip, exchanges and most casinos wont exist if werent for off-chain transactions. These are the types of things that help drive adoption. People are going to use off-chain more and more because thats where the biggest flexibility lies. What if the blocksize is increased to 20mb and someone creates a successful and reputable off-chain transaction system. Then the blocksize will be too big because people prefer to use the off-chain system, with the blocksize too big people that really have to use the blockchain wont have to compete and the fees will stay low, then the block reward slowly diminishes but the fees stay low, miners will lose incentive to mine then what?
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:22:17
This depends on if the law is dumb or not. If you want to argue the law is dumb, and will prosecute people for hosting the blockchain, then yes, there may be a problem. But given its decentralized nature, they cant prevent people from storing and hosting the blockchain in the end.

If we are going to theorize the only reason a mining pool can have the biggest share is by being the best. And that will change the moment they start acting maliciously. Then miners will be seeking an alternative. I mean we are really talking about a natural monopoly and those are not bad. These evovle 100% via the market, because 1 entity is simply the best.

There is not insurance on your bitcoin. There is insurance on their cold storage. If it gets hacked they get the equivalent back in USD as far as i understood. That is, if their insurance policy is up to date, and the exchange rate is based on a live one. I wouldnt be surprised if they get hacked, loose all bitcoin, they will go bankrupt rather than use their insurance.

Yes there is. The finite resource is decentralization, censorship resistance and a limited supply of bitcoin. All that goes away if nodes are pushed off the network because they cant affort to participate. 
And thats why i used the example of the federal reserve, bailouts and perpetual debt. You dont notice a problem day to day, but the system will become more and more unstable and eventually collapse.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:17:38
this is kind of off topic, but i hope bitmain investors set them straight soon. they are toying with hardforks and theres a significant chance it wont end well if they dont stop and signal segwit asap. they can continue with their hardforks game afterward, but dont block segwit.  
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:49:59
i wonder what their deal is
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:57:11
Yes i think you got the gist of it. So i presume the reason your node is expensive is because it consumes alot of bandwidth? Well there are ways around that. Afaik bitcoin core has a bandwidth limiter built in, but you can also prune the blockchain so that you will host less blocks and arguably, indirectly cut down on bandwidth use :)

@_date: 2017-02-05 08:36:09
So the point of raising the blocksize is to increase on-chain throughput. But the blocksize is a tax on decentralization afaik. The larger the blocksie is, the less decentralized bitcoin can be. 
So. What if you could increase on-chain throughput with new technology, so that blocksize wont have to be increased. or wont have to be increased as much? 
In the end larger blocks is not something anyone gives. The whole network has to fork the chain and move to the one with the larger blocks - if done with a hard fork. - Thats why its not as simple as simply giving miners larger blocks. But there is more to it than that.
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:04:13
its really not about miners or blockstream. its about bitcoin. if you think bitcoin will be worse off with a larger blocksize, malleabilty fix, and so on, i dont know what to tell you

But bitcoin isnt cheap. Using the blockchain isnt. Its artifically cheap right now because the miners are subsidized by block rewards imo. When we know the true cost of a blockchain transaction its possible even regulated money transfers will be cheaper.

Coinbase and bitpay will run their own miners, even tho its at a loss they are still profitable because their buisness relies on the blockchain etc. You understand? Mining dont have to be profitable in order for someone to have an incentive in doing it. Someone whos buisness relies on bitcoin and the blockchain will likely start up his own miners if he feels the hashrate has dropped too low.

You can always hardfork. Anyone can do it. But getting ppl to follow is probably hard. So that being said, hardforking is probably something you want to do in a worst case scenario. Its not like bitcoin is broken right now anyway. The lack of scaling is an inconvenience at best, but its not completely detrimental. Not yet at least. And that probably explains why miners are not eager to scale yet.

Yep. Erics proposal is high risk. If you guaranteed a hardfork down the line and half the network started upgrading, if it becomes contentious as we get closer, then momentum is swinging toward the hardfork anyway and coin might split.

Also upvotes for your crucial little detail. Pooling is most helpful to the little guy and least helpful to the big guys. You want decentralization? Thats what we have now. That GHash.IO has no significant competition is something else. I dont even think miners like to be with GHash.IO but because mining in itself is so competitive, they have to stay with the pool that is the most optimized and give the biggest return. When other pools catch up and miners can spread out more, there will be less of a worry. I dont even think GHash.IO would turn on the network, they have a far too lucrative buisness depending on them not doing it.
@_date: 2014-06-15 13:04:04
Its a major change in order to solve a problem that doesent exist yet. Sometimes the best thing is to do nothing and believe that is now. Ghash.IO is a very good pool, there is no denying that. They are able to attract alot of hashing power. But i think its only a temporary situation until the competition is able to keep up, and miners can spread out more without loosing money so to speak.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:35:53
But the thing is the block limit must be reached at some point. We need to look at what type of transactions should go on the blockchain. We cant simply say any transaction is fine, beause we have to think about the long term growth in size. There will come a point where blocks are consistently full, and as long as we allow bitcoin transactions to be free by increasing the blocksize its just going to postpone this day. Why do we want to postpone this?
The reason that block space is filling up is because its almost free to do a blockchain transaction. This means everyone and their mother will use it, even for simple purchases that may not need to be on the blockchain. The blockchain should be reserved for the payments that need to avoid censorship and payments that require non-reversability and the guarantee the blockchain otherwise provides. I imagine this is huge payments, and wealth transfers. Nations buying military equipment etc. Big ass payments with the security and guarantee of the bitcoin network.
But in order to get to that point fees have to rise. And i think its just a matter of time before the off-chain payment solutions begin to show up. Because we are all looking for smother ways to pay each other, cant get around that the addresses and the 10 minute confirmations feel clunky. Someone is going to develop a system that allows us to pay each other in bitcoin easier and smoother, albeit without using the blockchain, but there will be instant demand imo, and thus instant relief from pressure on the block size once the viable solutions arrives. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 07:02:21
Its not really a problem if you think about it. Blockchain transactions are clunky, they rely on large strings of random text, and they take 10 minutes and sometimes up to an hour or more to confirm. There wont be a demand to use the blockchain to purchase coffee, the demand will  be for large settlements and censorship resistant payments. When purchasing coffe people want something smoother than the blockchain. So you needent worry that much that alice or bob has to compete to get a spot in the blockchain because they dont want that spot in the first place. They want smoother ways to transact in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:48:44

What are you talking about? So far gigahash.io has performed splendidly. No shenanigans. Thats why miners prefer them.
And how would you stop pooling? If you somehow change the protocol so it cant be done via the internet, pooling will just happen in physical locations. There is also the problem that a guy with $10,000 will have much less impact on the network because how many blocks are you going to find if you can only solo mine or get in a lame 100TH pool, that would over charge electricity or be susceptible to sabotage? Restricting the ability to pool is going to reduce the security of the network since only players with millions to spare will have an incentive to get in on mining. This means the network will likely, not only be smaller but also grow slower, and therefor it would be easier in theory for a bad actor to amass equipment, online it at a crucial moment and take over the network indefinately.

Right. I hope it will be done at some point. But in the end, like Greg Maxwell said, the amount of extra space you get has diminishing returns. So a 4 or 8mb block, and a 32mb block will be less and less interesting. Not sure if that makes sense. How much better is bitcoin when it goes from 3 tps to 6? Or from 6 tps to 32? Its not that big of a deal. But thats not strictly an argument not to do it however.

In any case it doesent matter if its LTC or bitcoin. Because i presume the bug will be fixed. So the best course of action is to get SegWit active on bitcoin asap. The initial phase can be considered the test. The first people who use it, are actually testing it. Most people will still be using the legacy transaction format on activation and it will still be available for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:14:42
There is no rate of adoption of BU until its forked into bitcoin. You can say the same for SegWit except many large and small economic actors as well as developers and public spokesmen in bitcoin have expressed support for it.
It doesent cost random joe to run a BU node much. It doesent cost the miners to signal BU much. In my mind its a magic trick. They try to fudge the numbers on for example coin.dance to influence you.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:54:37


This wouldnt be bad, actually. Reason i post this is because segwit and schnorr has huge potential in crypto and its something Core have made for us. Where'as the solution other people have provided dont come with any real potential, and some pretty big risks.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:36:24
Right now every transaction is put into a block by miners, and then another block is built on top, which means the transactions in the block underneath cannot be changed. However there is a limit to how large these blocks can be, which is 1 megabyte. 
SegWit reorganises the way a transaction is composed, meaning that you can actually have blocks that are larger than 1 megabyte.
Not only does this increase blocksize and throughout, it also fixes and improves a variety of other things.

i havent given it much thought, but i think cloud mining removes risk from mining and gives it to the cloud miner. because the money is paid up front. so if there is a contentious fork and a significant drop in value, the actual owner of the equipment isnt hurt as bad, but the cloud miner is? this changes the game theory/incentives behind PoW a bit.

Confirmations will matter more and more as the network gets saturated. The only reason confirmations dont matter now is because there is free block space and its safe to assume any transaction will confirm. This is why the block size increases. It grows faster than it should. Raising the block limit will not solve the problem but only kick it down the road. What we need are viable off-chain solutions that take unnesecary load of the blockchain.

Imo the most likely outcome is that SegWit activates. But when, i dont know. If you want to throw a hardfork into the mix you reduce the chance of activation significalty imo. Unless you want to count a contentious fork as activation - but even a contentious fork seem unlikely

Trickle down in the socialist sense is stupid because the money is taken from someone else. Thats not a sound economic approach. But if you bail out a large corporation aka the 1%, the money trickles down to the employees etc. Its not a sound economic approach either but its trickle down none the less, and it causes inflation, if the money was created out of thin air ---- which it usually is in these cases.

Bitcoin is an organic network whith spontaneous organisation. Saying that users do not have control when it comes to a softfork is a stretch.

Bitcoin comes with a basic payment system. The dollar didnt even come with one afaik. However there are so many layers on top of the dollar now thats how you can have credit scores etc. These layers will come in bitcoin too with time i imagine.

This is risky times to hold bitcoin. I my myself am holding a big portion relative to my savings. And im very conflicted. If the ETF is a yes i will profit, if its a no, i will not. Why put my money on such a gamble?

Yea. Lets skip the discussion and have a hard fork asap. If we missed something we can always hard fork again herp.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:11:04
One of the biggest issues is the blockchain growth. Having it grow up to potentially 20 times faster than it already does seems unneccesary.  There needs to be a good reason for speeding up the growth in size of the blockchain. Bitcoin can grow even if block sizes stay at 1mb imo. There is no guarantee it will grow slower or faster. In fact with 1 mb limit, off-chain transactors will likely become a bigger market sooner, which can help adoption. In the end most people wont care if they are using the blockchain or not when sending bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 11:02:25
Probably not, but i dont think OP is wrong. He was looking forward to some kind of  flex cap proposal, which i think seems reasonable. But i mean, it may not happen until end of 2017 or next year. Or maybe even later.. :) Np tho.

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:17:15
You may still use bitcoin. But im going to recieve downvotes for this. But its important to keep in mind. If you have a coinbase wallet, and you shop with a coinbase merchant, the transaction does not go to the blockchain. This means you can use bitcoin hassle free. This is the kind of things that will make people keep using bitcoin, even tho there might be queues to use the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:55:51
One of the reasons you need a loan to buy a house today is because thats how its been for ages. cheap credit drives up the cost of homes. when people cant keep their wealth in the money because it devaluates they frantically look for things to put their wealth in. Such as real estate. this drives up the cost as well.
so basically in a deflationary system there wont be a need to borrow money to buy a house since houses will be much cheaper hehe
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:07:14
It is not guaranteed that if bitcoin core joins the miners that want to hardfork that it will prevent two chains.
If miners do something stupid like contentious hardfork, bitcoin wont go to 0. But it will take a hit and it could regain it relatively quick. You will have coins on both chains, altho im not sure the ones on the hardforked chain will be worth hundreds of dollars at first.
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:57:39
Good point. But is here any truth to the statement that old clients cannot spend coins that came from a segwit adress?
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:36:02
This is bad right? It allows people to convert bitcoin to gold, which we probably shouldnt support. Gold or precious metals in general are directly competing with bitcoin for being a store of value and possibly a medium of exchange. I for one downvoted this. What the fuck did i just write

I wonder what he is using to keep track of transactions. Many people also think bitcoins are interesting, but not interesting enough to make them go through the hassle of getting bitcoin. When/if it gets easier, it will become more widespread. However the more rallies there and the more media attention the less reluctant people will be. So once the transactions have picked up, it might be too late getting into the phenomnon. Not entirely too late, i think bitcoin will continue to exist for a while, but the big money to be made is now.

In that case it goes both ways. How can you say for certain intelligent robots will decide to wage war against humans?  What do they get out of it? They dont get additional resources because waging war is expensive, its a net loss. Living in peace yields a much better economic outcome. However i wouldnt be surprised if the humans would one day decide to start a war against the robots. But the inevitable outcome will be that there is peace before either side is extinct.

@_date: 2017-02-08 02:30:44
I think miners are reluctant to signal because they are stubborn. They probably see themselves as the masters of bitcoin, so when there is a new softfork, they wont activate it unless we kiss their boots.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:18:26
I presume some sort of constitutional right or paragraph that limit government power?
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:46:17
There is a long time until a contentious hardfork happens. It wont be until after SegWit has expired (If it doesent activate) but the existence of BU alone right now could threaten the ETF. I mean if i was looking for an excuse as a regulator to not approve it, i would point to them.
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:22:38
by dam breaking i suppose you mean segwit actvating? because segwit is what is being held hack
and what do you think would happen if segwit got a flag day hardfork instead of miner signalling, you silly goose.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:30:23
Could it be that bitcoin is becomming more deflationary? In 2011 they made 50 coins ber block. Today they only make 12.5. 
Also the way bitcoin is changing, people are spending less and less and hodling more, because of the fees. Im positive this also acts as a catalyst on the deflation.
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:37:06
Another point is that SegWit is a new transaction format which solves a variety of things, that you probably want to solve at some point anyway. And for these fixes and features you would also have to update software to accomodate them. 
tl;dr saying that segwit is bad because users have to update to accomodate it is a terrible point to make.

The challenge is regulation. CEX.io does something consumers like, but its kind of illegal the way they do it. Not because its bad in any way, but because government regulation aimed at something completely different ends up encompassing bitcoin as well

@_date: 2014-06-14 10:32:09
A mining pool have limited power since it relies on the consent of the individual miners. Right now ghash is the best pool, not so much because its the biggest but because it has low latency, no fee, high uptime, merge mines several coins and so on. What miners get is a reliable pool that chews through blocks as fast as possible. If this would change, for example if it begins double spending although i cannot see any reason why they would, miners will switch pools ad ghash no longer does what they want
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:33:23

@_date: 2017-02-10 08:37:19
You would hope that miners realise sooner or later that they are only running bitcoin into the ground by not signalling SegWit. 
Anyway we've heard it before. In 2012 it was Litecoin has bigger blocks and faster confirmation times. In 2017 its Ethereum has LN! ...
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:47:25
Tbh. Litecoin is only mildly better than Testnet where segwit has been active for a long time already. So I dont understand what their concern is. What excactly do they want to test?
This reeks of bureaucracy.

@_date: 2014-03-28 17:10:07
Oh shit yes. One of the biggest sources of income for organised crime is the prohibition of for example cannabis. Little to no legitimate buisnesses are selling it, so it ends up being a big buisness for organised crime..
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:25:05
The network is not absolutely dependant on income from finding blocks and processing blockchain transactions. It is likely that companies or individuals with a stake in bitcoin will run mining equipment, even at a loss, because they depend on a robust network.
And if you want mining fees to increase, you dont increase the blocksize, you let people compete for the space. The smaller it is, the higher people are likely willing to pay. In the end bitcoin is just an experiment, well at least it is currently, and bitcoins integrity will be fine regardless if the blocksize is 1mb or 20mb.
@_date: 2017-02-16 13:56:33
This is true if bitcoin was a democracy and if it was specifically setup to favor politics. But its not and it doesent.
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:20:48
I dont see how that can be the case. SegWit is a fresh way to transact bitcoin, and has twice the capcity than the legacy transactions. So not sure what betamax is, but segwit aint it.

@_date: 2017-02-11 18:19:45
Its ok. If DCG wont get behind segwit the problems of who they represent will just get worse and eventually they wont exist anymore. Meanwhile people would have adapted to higher fees and suddenly you get a new DCG with interests in that. Bitcoin is what it is.
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:38:03
Yes i know there are alot of different services, and they wont change at once, but i dont think its going to get very confusing. Most people use the same place for ticker info, trades, etc. i think it is only a minority of people who use 10 different places, analyzes exchange rate and so on, and yes these people will experience the most inconvenience as the transition is made. But dont say it wont be for the better. Also keep in mind there is a variance of opininon, denominations ,what to call them and so on, right now because there is no official path. Once the official path is made clear which is what the BTC foundation is pushing for i imagine, there is going to be broader standardisation, faster etc.
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:12:05
OK so the inflation is being used to pay the miners. It still sucks my bitcoin are getting worth less.
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:20:42
I understand that. But compare bitcoin to the internets history. That doesent  guarantee anything, but these things tend to grow FAST.
You didnt adress the fundamental problems of the world economy and the corporations on the stock market. Are they able to produce value? What if there are new problems in the financial sector? Etc.
I think there is alot to worry about, not just a reccession, but a real crash comming, where the "strong" companies will be sorted from the weak. In reality alot of the companies on the stock market are on some kind of welfare, so i would want to avoid these. That is especially banks, farming... You know what alot of paper wealth is going to vanish within the next few years. Bitcoin is not paper wealth, not to the same extend, it actually has the chance to be embraced and provide value, be useful... Does it make sense? I dont think Bitcoin is as risky as the stock market right now.

All factors which can be dealt with by entrepenours, ie. the market. A legimitate concern here would be for the government to make it artificially difficult for entrepenours to fix these problems. That could be, expensive licenses to deal with bitcoin, entangling regulation etc.
I was comming to this thread expecting legimitate criticism but it does not seem to be the case. Those are all areas which people are currently working to improve, if you think bitcoin is bad now, you should have seen it 2 or 3 years ago when people had much less options etc.
Anyway, good luck trying to solve these problems you have pinpointed. Focus on one, start a buisness, and get going

I agree with your sentiment. But its a double edged sword. Im thinking that "infighting" does not weaken bitcoin, but, it also doesent make it stronger. Its just status quo.

However, if things were to collapse, and government had to go back to the drawing board, i mean if the dollar collapsed, and the fed ended, it could be possible they would start using bitcoin, simply because everyone else already did

Its not easy for the government to take away peoples privacy. I dont know if what you suggest is feasable for the government. I mean if such a system can be setup and maintaned in a technical sense. But getting to that point is going to require some serious convincing of the public. What could the government say to convince people to surrender their privacy when it comes to bitcoin? I dont think things can get to that point. I dont think there is going to be an elaborate white listing scheme by the government when it comes to bitcoin. There will be too much resistance from the community. And the longer time goes, the bigger the bitcoin community gets, the harder it will be for the government to get something like this up and running i think.

Its not a point of no-return. Its only a natural monopoly. If it stops acting in accordance with the wishes of the miners it will crumble. If a pool obtains 75% hashing the power it would have to be honest and top tuned. It would have to be superior to the competition. This means among other things not screwing around, blocking changes, double spending etc.
I dont understand your concern
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:07:26
You are incorrect, at the moment regulation is preventing bitcoin from reaching a bigger audience, that is both buisness and consumer wise. Buisneses have to live up to tough requirements that makes them unable to even get of the ground. For example a bitcoin atm in the US would require upwards of 2 million USD in security regulatory bonds, and they will need to collect sensitive data about their customers. From the consumer side they have to provide sensitive data to the exchanges or pay high fees and meet with individuals on the street corner to get bitcoin. Thats the current reality, and its entirely due to regulations

What is the point of these guarantees. Nobody can guarantee a hardfork. Thats the point of bitcoin to begin with.
I think people should put themselves in for examples Core's shoes. They dont command bitcoin. If they "guaranteed" to hardfork in say 1-2 years. What if only 50% of people are using bitcoin core then? Etc.
Take a look at Bitcoin Unlimited as well, who are the epitome of hardforkers. They dont even have an activation threshold, or plan, or anything, and thats because nobody can gurantee it. Effectively what BU has done is cripple bitcoin because their solution is not complete. Its basically vaporware that gives the wrong impression of how bitcoin works. This is in contrast to SegWit which will 100% activate as soon as miners signal for it. WHY WONT THEY

@_date: 2015-05-06 16:51:20
Should it be low-cost? If the goal was to make a low-cost transaction system the blockchain is a terrible idea. Ive had this discussion before so i will just get straight to the point. What the blockchain is good at is transferring bitcoin between two parties with little to no possibility of a charge back. Second, a blockchain transaction is also censorship resistant. These are most important properties imo. And you dont get around that its expensive to achive this. Its likely that too many transactions are on the blockchain right now, ie. people buying coffee and tipping each other should not neccesarily be on the blockchain, this transaction does not need to be on the blockchain ledger and kept forever. But we dont know what kind of transactions should, what kind of transaction can be considered a valid blockchain tx, because the miners are subsidized by the block reward. The market is also too immature, there are no decent alternatives to a blockchain transaction yet and that is because the transactions are currently subsidized. I think its important to not do anything until the block limit is being consistently hit and the market has had a chance to work around it, before changing the protocol.

You may be right. But this isnt something that will happen over night.

I dont think there is any on-going work on that. And i cant say i blame anyone for not wanting to work on consensus changes for bitcoin. Not with this climate. To be honest i think we are at a point where the only likely outcome is a split. We can try and prevent it but its easier to just let it happen. And i presume that bitcoin will be better off after the fact. May the best chain win. --- And then maybe the world will know why hardforks should be avoided, and why SegWit was the better option from the start and we will get a healther and more reasonable relationship between devs and miners. 
I mean in the industrial revolution human beings learned most from accidents and disasters. But we only got stronger afterward. Cant see why bitcoin is any different. Sometimes a disaster is the only thing that can teach people. We can warn against it all we want. But it probably wont change anything. The disaster has to happnen for people to truly learn. Have a nice day. And sorry for the rant.

@_date: 2015-05-06 13:22:04
That is an ignorant statement to be honest.Off-chain transactions are already being used by exchanges because its not economical to use the blockchain. Sites such as prime dice use off-chain transactions because using the blockchain is not economical, and even changetip is a service that works off-chain. You use the blockchain when you want to exit these sites and services, and thats how it should be, because it keeps blockchain growth to a minimum. Transactions fees are artifically low at the moment because miners get rewarded with newly minted bitcoin, you cant count on this forever. No matter what people will move off-chain as the true cost of on-chain transactions is revealed.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:42:26

@_date: 2017-02-07 09:42:39
The thing is with bitcoin you can do whatever you want. Miners can block segwit for as long as they want. And then what? They will present their own solution down the road because Core will not i think. Core doesent have anything else than SegWit so if it doesent pass, anyone who proposes anything, will take the money after that. And thats where BU comes in. But they will never get Core on board, so the only result as far as i can see is a contentious hardfork. What i hope happens then is that the people who decided to hardfork, will sit with a coin that isnt very interesting and they will be losing alot of money. Meanwhile, the Core chain will activate SegWit and be well along with further scaling improvements such as aggregated signatures. So those are just my speculations. Of course alot can happen in 12 months and SegWit can even activate without much trouble but im slightly skeptical at this point :)
tl;dr this game of blocking segwit miners are taking a huge risk and they have the most at stake. most people dont understand that blocking segwit is the same as advocating for a contentious hardfork, but the people who have been blocking it so far are in too deep. There is almost no going back now without losing face. And that is the hardest thing for anyone to do. So they are all-in.

That is probably the worst argument for going in and killing startups. People should be able to store their bitcoin, and make wallets that attempt to store bitcoin for people whatever way they like. Otherwise you are crossing the fascist line. If you guys are indeed right, and web-wallets fail more often than not, then the market will stop pursing such a solution. But if you go and ban it, or make it difficult for people to make web-wallets or bitcoin buisneses entirely you are basically fulfilling your own prophecy because many innovators etc. will have to avoid well bitcoin all together.

At this point its going to come down to a contentious hardfork. Theres still a slim chance that miners will start signalling segwit but i doubt it. Human beings are stubborn and the ones who havent opted into signalling yet most likely never will, regardless of what kind of points we make etc.
So sometime late this year, or maybe early 2018 there is going to be a contentious hardfork, and after the fallout of that has settled maybe segwit can activate.

@_date: 2017-02-12 10:20:23
Yep. segwit makes even larger blocks safe. i can see a hardfork with flexible limits in the post segwit era. i mean wether one sees segwit as a bandaid or not it must come before even larger blocksize increases tbh. also we only need the remaining miners to signal, then it can safely activate. so we can hive it within weeks. this is in contrast to a hardfork which would still be a long ways away if it has to activate safely.

the blocksize issue is a delicate one. lowering it will be better for nodes long term. however, increasing it will be bad for nodes long term but arguably good for people who spend bitcoin on-chain here and now. So which one do you pick? We know that the largest group by far is people who spend bitcoin on-chain and the node operators are a minority. Imo its a good thing bitcoin is more nuanced than majority rule since that would otherwise seem like a guaranteed implosion at one point.

@_date: 2015-05-07 07:12:25


That doesent mean there is 0 advantage to trusting Coinbase or Paypal to perform off-chain transactions for you.
We have to keep people from using the blockchain. The blockchain should exist only to protect the integrity of bitcoin. It also provides censorship resistant payments. Yes there is probably going to be a bigger demand for these kinds of payments in the near future but at the moment the blockchain is filled with lesser transactions, such as people purchasing coffee. That doesent need to be recorded in the blockchain and kept, well indefinately. Blockchain is already 33gb in size. I think we need to sort the coffe purchases first, before we increase the block size, and in order to sort the coffee purchases the blockspace must get crowded because then people will realise and start to build solutions that are cheap and efficient that people can use to do coffee purchases with. Only when the blockspace gets crowded and we get proper off-chain systems as a result from that can we measure the true demand for a block size increase.

define capacity? And why is it a problem? Imagine if bitcoin never changed from here on. Would that be bad?
In any case, increasing capacity can be done with technology, rather than say increasing the 1mb blocksize limit. And you have LN/Payment channels which is pretty cool. SegWit makes it easy to deplay aggregated signatures which makes transactions, specifically multisignature ones significantly smaller. So thats another way to increase capacity as well. Etc.

Free block space is a bad idea when you consider the nature of the blockchain and how its just going to continue to grow. In my opinion we want people to use the blockchain as little as possible and only when they absolutely have to, or have no other choice. We dont get to that point by increasing the block size prematurely.

Hello, thank you for your post.
1. Can bitcoin be improved? Or do these things have to be in from the beginning?
2. Does bitcoin need to be kept by the so-called average user, or is it possible the network can survive even if nodes becomes enterprise only, so to speak. At least we see in mining it does well after moving out of the average user mining with his graphics card phase.
3. When we see institutions like nasdaq adopting bitcoin rather than starting their own chain, isnt that a sign of strength? It seems the market is more interesting in keeping a single chain, rather than several. What this means is, even if mining stops being profitable, wont these same rather large institutions take over the task, they will run the hardware to keep the network from being vulnerable? Further more, how can we be certain that mining will stop being profitable?

Core just makes some software that works with bitcoin. I dont know why people are thinking they control bitcoin. Its true that they have some authority in that they have made consistent and reliable software so their opinion weigh alot. But they dont command the consensus rules or which direction the network takes. Thats really up to the whole network. But for some reason people are trying to paint Core as evil. I think they just want attention, and/or have ulterior motives.

The BU miner signalling is not worth much since its a hardfork, so it requires nodes to be updated as well. And that could take some time. Given all the material that is out there for why BU is a bad idea, im not sure they will ever get consensus to fork. So i dont care much about how many miners are ready for it. The network as a whole is not, and i dont think it ever will be.
SegWit on litecoin first will not be bad for segwit proponents. Considering the execution goes smoothly. I dont know how well the litecoin devs tested it. I dont know how well they adapted it.

I dont see bitcoin succeding in the long term if the solution is just to raise blocksize without looking at what kind of transactions are taking place. Imo off-chain systems are needed to reduce the load on the blockchain. Ideally only transactions that need to avoid censorship and transactions that require absolute non-reversability and the guarantee the blockchain otherwise provides will be on the blockchain. Guys making purchases at starbucks does not fall under this category imo. But by blindly increasing the block size, we allow this. And then these lower tiers of transaction will crowd the blocks until 20mb is reached and then what? Actually before we reach 20mb the off-chain providers will likely have established themselves and the peasants for lack of a better term will begin using those. 
Ideally we dont think about raising the block size until we know what the true demand is. And we dont know the true demand until fees begin to rise and people have a viable alternative to pay each other without using the blockchain imo.

I imagine that you can already test your software on testnet to make sure it wont create invalid block - is creating invalid blocks even a legitimate concern? Genuinely curious.


So the argument is there could be bugs in SegWit because it hasnt been tested on a live network therefore people have not have an incentive to try and break it. Well, i understand that point. But thats why its even more important to get it activated on bitcoin asap. Because we wont know wether or not SegWit is truly safe until it has been active on bitcoin for a while. The cool thing about SegWit is that its opt-in. And bitcoin Core wallet dont even support it in the gui yet afaik. Adoption of SegWit will increase as confidence in the format increases. However adoption should be faster and more widespread than P2SH, because of the direct economic incentive to migrate to SegWits once it active.

Good question. Im not an expert, so this is just going off what ive read on reddit and picked up from the bitcoin core slack over time. 
SegWit is a way to transfer ownership of bitcoin from one person to the other and having the miners give the transaction their stamp of approval per transaction.
Lightning is another way to transfer ownership of bitcoin from one person to the other, except the transfer doesent immediately get the miners stamp of approval. The benefits are that the transaction is more effecient but marginally less secure. 
Please correct me if im wrong.

@_date: 2015-01-12 15:11:01
It could. Transaction fees must rise in the future if miners is to have an incentive to keep mining which keep the network secure. A way to make fees increase is to have scarcity in each block. This will lead to people bidding with the transaction fees to get included in the next block, or whatever, depending on the urgency of their transaction, leading to rising transaction fees and a off-chain transaction system. If the blocksize is too big, and there is enough room to meet demand, i think transaction fees will remain low, and miners in the end wont have an incentive to mine.
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:41:50
miners have the option of refusing to mine or mining something else. ie. they can go on strike or quit to attempt to influence the network to change consensus rules. this would be an interesting scenario.

The fees play an important role in ensuring the network will scale for one thing.
This graph shows how a blockchain grows with little or no fees, vs one with a relatively mild fee presure.
The network with the red line has little or no fee pressure and the chain is a bit out of control.
And [this excerpt]( from an equity analyst really puts the nail on the head re transaction fees.

@_date: 2016-03-04 23:28:55
if the end goal is to make bitcoin scale it doesent really make sense to  bloat the blockspace with free space. by routing the network into full blocks we are openening possibly the greatest avenue for mainstream adoption. Namely the incentive for off-chain transactions. So if we are getting a 2mb blocksize limit, its best to wait until blocks are full to get the network into that gear right away. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 01:25:20

Most bitcoin transactions are made via the blockchain today. This puts pressure on the block size. But we dont need to have most of the transactions on the blockchain. The blockchain dont have to register alice and bobs purchases at starbucks for example. And i think alice and bob are already looking for an alternative. There would certainly be a demand for an alternative to the clunky blockchain transactions - they rely on long strings of random text, and they take approximately 10 minutes and sometimes up to an hour or more to confirm.

I am not a miner, but i imagine its a very fast paced game. Meaning you have to keep upgrading and online equipment to stay profitable. By this logic, what miners do is spend time and energy on upgrading and being at the forefront rather than pausing to speculate in stopping a hardfork or creating one. Miners want the mining game to be as smooth as possible so they can just focus on optimising their mining enterprise and get as many legitimate blocks as possible. Basically there is most incentive to stay acting according to the rules rather than try to change them. Of course this can be good and bad at the same time. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:00:00
And what do you think this possibility is at? Almost everything you do with money on the internet works without the blockchain, and with that the possibility of the individual services creating money for themselves. But its not a widespread problem to my knowledge. So i dont understand where you are going with that argument. Even today in bitcoin land a majority of the services that utiliize off-chain transactions dont do this.

I think you are sugar coating it. However you are techinically correct.

They buy the stuff with the stolen CC, have it delivered to the person who requested it, and then collect their BTC. Rinse repeat. Basically purse.io is a platform for people to monetize stolen credit cards. Of course people signing up with their wishlists dont know they are supporting credit card fraud, thats the trick.

Fractional reserve banking is harmless, if it wasnt for the state enforcing us to use the same bank. Its effectively a monopoly, and the "money" they sell us, they charge interest on. The money simply comes out of a printer, its basicially a scam. Its not the fractional reserve that makes it so. Its the fact that they have an effective monopoly, served by the state. In theory anyone could set up their own printer, and start making money and fractional reserve banking, but no-one is going to use your crap, or trust you. With the federal reserve its a different story because the entire economy is practically hung up on their crap, via state laws and what not.

@_date: 2015-05-05 09:38:31
It seems like you have a thorough understanding of the situation. What is the negative consequence if block size is raised? What could go wrong? And further more whats the point? The bitcoin network will never be able to scale completely anyway. At some point off-chain transactors will take over, while the bitcoin network takes care of keeping bitcoins themselves sound. Become a sort of auditing tool, as well as censorship resistant payment method. But thats not what people need for their day to day transactions. I am learning toward keeping the 1mb block size, and just let the market sort out the rest, via off-chain transactions etc. Because its going to happen sooner or later anyway because bitcoin cannot scale to a satisfactory degree in its own, if even just a small percentage of the world is going to use it.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:14:30
Very short article. Does not try to predict what will happen when the block reward goes away. So that left me kind of disappointed.
One that the increased blocksize is going to do is subsizide transactions for another year or more. When people can use the blockchain free of charge (the fee is there i know, but kind of low.) they will. This means more transactions than neccesary will take place on the blockchain. This is not neccesarly cause for concern because storage and bandwith etc. is not really being overused even at maxed out blocks afaik. But i would still like to hear whats going to happen when the block reward goes away. And how the blockchain is going to look after 10 years of blocks with 20mb.

Reccession is similar to a forrest fire. Its not nice, but it clears out the unhealthy parts of the economy and gives room for new growth. This is a cycle that has to be done every now and then.

Im not sure i agree with this. Its not possible for Ethereum and Bitcoin to co-exist peacefully. Its a zero sum game. Its one or the other. The problem i have with Ethereum is that its making alot of noise. And it presents itself as being way better than bitcoin. But its excactly the same, but it has bigger challenges than bitcoin as far as i can tell, because of the scripting system in particular. It wont scale well. So even tho it looks like an "us vs them" mentality. I think there are good arguments as to why Ethereum is a bad idea, and why people like VB should recognize this.

The fork shouldnt happen until every block has been max size for a while. This way miners will have an incentive to switch because the blocks they get will include more transactions and therefore more fees. Another incentive will be that once the block size keeps being hit, the fees will start to grow. People with varying urgency of payment will outbid others for a spot in the next block. It will be good for miners, and when the blocksize eventually increases they will have an incentive to switch, because even tho there may only be 100-200 transactions more per block initially, it would still be lucrative i imagine, if the fees have been been bid up. Eventually the fees will slow down, and by that time, most miners, or rather, enough miners would have already switched.

This is just something we are going to have to live with. This might be a bad example, but i dont know what you think about guns. But people own guns, doesent mean they will use it to do bad. However there is still a chance, but overall people owning guns is for the better.
Its the same with mining pools. Overall they are for the better. We havent witnessed a run on a mining pool yet, its possible we will sooner or later if a large one gets compromised or turns sour from within. 
However that is a risk we have to take, because pooled mining allows anyone to enter the race. If pooling got restricted, that would mean people with ~$1,000-$50,000 might as well not bother. Because how many blocks are you going to mine solo with that before difficulty increases?
If pooled mining really got restricted only the really rich or people with some serious capital would have an incentive to enter mining. Therefor network would likely be less decentralized, smaller, and grow slower and that gives a better oppertunity for someone to amass equipment in secret, online it a once and take over the network indefinately.

What i dont undertstand is they started the vote before figuring out how to do it, if it was a yes. As far as i understood they found out after, the equipment wasnt compatible with p2pool, the manufacturer had to update the firmware first. They did it rather quick tho. But anyway, who invests in cloudmining? Its an additional middlemen, and mining is so competitive to begin with, i dont understand how it is profitable for investors in the end. I mean, who goes through the hassle of obtaining mining equipment, setting it up, only to give the BTC to someone else? Me no understand........

How would you proove it? Purse.io does nothing to catch or prevent credit card fraud. 
I dont know how you think the service works. But its not as simple as giving your credit card details and then your done. Coins will be in escrow for days, and there is always a risk the guy you bought items for dont release the coins. There is also the problem with orders usually being around 20% premium, and they get bought all the time. Who risks $1000 with their own credit card, to get bitcoins at a 20% premium?
You cant deny purse.io can be used to monetize stolen credit cards

The trick is to not be blatant about it. If people realised, or if they took to much, there would be a revolt. So they go to one small group at a time, and they keep on doing it until they have squeezed the entire economy and it no longer can sustain.
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:28:22
Okay. This is a good start.
In my opinion SegWit should come before a blocksize limit increase because SegWit is the format we want people to use in larger blocks as its better for the network overall. However SegWit has a blocksize increase built in and it is expected to see blocks that are pretty much 100% larger than today. Thats a nice touch, considering there is no decent hardfork proposal yet to my knowledge that increase blocksize. Tl;dr It seems to be a good idea to acrivate SegWit now.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:23:11

If one was willing to implement lifetimes for UTXO's i think it could be a big scalability win for bitcoin. So lets say a UTXO will die after 10 years from when it was created. This means that some of the oldest UTXO's in bitcoin that has never moved, still has a few years before they are reshuffled into the block reward.

No i think that SegWit can activate with 50% of the miners. I think that its really up to them. But i dont know how easy it is for them. Thats why i said im not an expert. But i know other softforks have activated at 55% for example.

You can reliably predict what a market operator will or will not do by looking at the incentives. For example why would they not protect their buisness from being used malicously? What would happen to them if it did etc.
You can also reliably predict what a market operator can or cannot do by looking at the current market conditions. For example how many PH do you estimate cex.io will need to buy in order to own 51% of the network hashing rate? What do you think the possibilty of them getting it is? Considering cost and total supply of new asics from factories etc.

The political conflict will only happen if the block size is increased when there is no need for it. Even tho some of the blocks reach the maximum size now, it is still too soon to switch imo. It would have to be when each block consistently hits the limit, and the transactions fees have been bid up as a result, that it would make most sense to switch. Otherwise you end up with miners not switching, because all they get is increased block sizes, and other miners speculating in the fork failing, and staying on the old one. Besides what would happen if we wait?
As an additional note i dont believe the blockchain is meant for retail use, or day to day transactions. The blockchain is far too ineffecient for this. Off-chain transactors should take care of this, so actual transactions that need censorhsip protection, or non-reversibility, can take place on the blockchain. By this principle, even staying at 1mb would be fine, as the market will have to find ways around it, for transactions that dont have to be on the blockchain. For example retail.
A possible side effect of increasing the block size would be that transaction fees dont increase enough, and as the bitcoin  block reward halves and becomes insignicant, miners will not have a big enough incentive to keep their equipment on, leaving bitcoin more vulnerable.

This is not the correct way to approach the uninitiated. Let them mine if they want to. I mean i dont even know what mining is like anymore. I guess you purchase an ASIC, and then mine. Beware tho that pre-order have been a bad sign in the past. Carefully research the merchant before you buy. And beware that difficulty tends to increase exponentially. So you have to keep upgrading, and you have to take that into your calculations when deciding wether or not to get a rig. If we just told everyone not to mine, maybe they wont mine, and maybe they wont experience it, maybe they wont try to make mining better etc. Imagine if the new Steve Jobs read your post and thought oh well guess i wont mine then. Epic catastrophe tbh. This is why you dont teach your conclusions, but help others to understand them, and then have them make their own basicially. ,.,.hfdh.kljghfkljklj

Regarding Oil. If someone owns the entire oil supply. Shouldnt they be able to decide the price? Its their oil. Right? Or do you believe you have a right to it, so to speak? Is that principle? Do i have the right to oil in your backyard, your oranges or what. Do you understand what im saying?

CEX.io is being very honest, in fact they serve an example to others. They rent out mining equipment. And they have a very successful buisness. At the same time they run a mining pool, and they are smart enough to let 3rd party miners join them for free, so it looks like the equipment they rent out produces alot of BTC (In the long run, they dont...)

Afaik the closest thing you will get to measuring adoption is by looking at hashrate signalling and node count. There's a not so subtle difference when it comes to BU and various other hardforks in that Miner signalling is not enough for it to activate. SegWit "only" needs miners to get ready then it will activate and the ecosystem can start using it. After SegWit activates its easy to track adoption because you can just look at how many people are using that type of transaction.

Well if you think back to why the fed was created, to solve a problem of bank runs, maybe it makes sense for them to take blockchain technology to them. But to be honest, the blockchain technology will be solving the problem in and of itself, kind of. Actually i never think we will be able to get rid of bank runs. I think the solution they have now, is just they hide the cost, they tug in under the rug. There is still a big problem out there that needs to be solved. Or. Its like a pressure valve, some steam need to be let of. Some banks need to go bankrupt. And not just banks. Even companies, and even government, or parts of it. But its not going to happen as long as they have the federal reserve who can prop up the system for a while. In the end, the entire thing is going to collapse at once, and the problems will be much bigger when that time comes, compared to if the banks, governments, etc. just went bankrupt initially, and not having a central bank intervene. That is my ignorant opinion of it all.

Reminds me of when i heard about bitcoin first. Looked into it, decided it wasnt worth it. Year later or so, i hear about it again, price was 3x higher but this time i got some.
That being said, adoption has nothing to do with the amount of coins being mined. Since they are still tradable, tippable and otherwise capable of changing hands there is the possibility of a economy. The economy is not even limited by the amount of tx possible per minute in the blockchain, since 3rd party transactors can work around this limit. Sort of like paypal works around traditional bank transfers. Seperate systems, same thing (the dollar, in this case) changing hands.
If you want to focus on the exchange rate, it is not capped at anything. People have been predicting exchange rates of $10,000 or more, which means $200 exchange rate is not past early phase. What would you think the exchange rate is capped at? And why?

I have an idea. Private scores and open and kind mods. The type of people who cause drama and strife only do it if they feel they are not getting attention, or if they are not approached with respect. They throw tantrums. You know the type. Either the subreddit opens up, and everyone gets treated equally, regardles of how little effort they chose to put into their post, treated with kindness first and foremost. Then you wont have many trouble makers. And those that make trouble, keep kind, and explain they are being banned. Nobody likes to see a "deleted". There has to be a mod reply underneath with a kind explanation of "you stepped over the line and you have been warned before so you leave us with no other choice than to ban you" But who is interested in being kind to someone they might not neccesrily respect, someone they may even deem inferior to them? Thats the question. And the answer is to find mods that are willing to be kind regardles of how little respect they have for the individual in question. Because everyone is watching, and kind mods will make or break a community.

Nice tool. I would also like to say that a vote for BU is a vote for stalling bitcoin. From my point of view, and im not a hot shot miner like Bitmain etc. it makes more sense to activate SegWit, and get those benefits rolling, while you try to form consensus around BU. Because at this rate, with miners blocking segwit, there isnt going to be bigger blocks for a while. Oh damn.
Even if bitcoin forks to BU, it would still make sense to have the  segwit transaction format, since its better for the blockchain so to speak.

You will have to purchase alot of miners. Online them all at once. Keep adding enourmous amounts. When the difficulty is driven up sufficiently, destroy the miners. Depending on how much you drove up the difficulty it will take years or months for a new block to be found. Enough to kill the currency imo. But then there will be another..

When you read the governments response to the bail request, things do not make sense. The first murder for hire was allegedly paid for by using the banking system and not bitcoin. This does not make sense.
The guy was supposedly going to have to die because he had taken advantage of some vendor tools, he was given, in order to help some vendors. It sounds far out imo. He paid $80,000 for this. Which doesent make sense. Kick the moderator from the staff, problem solved. Why go through the trouble of using the banking system, and even murdering him. Jesus.
The second murder for hire, which is the one they emphasize the most on, not just backed by anecdotal evidense from an undercover agent like the first one, ie. there is a transaction on the blockchain, also dont make sense. Ulbricht allegdly paid someone in bitcoin this time, to carry out a murder on someone who had allegdly been blackmailing ulbricht. Allegations are supported by a log on Ulbrichts confiscated laptop which entries along the line "today i attempted murder for hire" and the next log entry the day after says "The murder for hire was successful" Why would he write this down on his personal PC. The blackmailing did apparantly stop but the FBI consulted with Canadian law enforcement authorities, who have no record of any Canadian resident with the identify for the blackmailer
that DPR passed to an alleged assasin/bounty hunter. This also raises some questions.

nobody know what the correct difficulty is. if bitcoin mining becomes less profitable in the future it wont neccerily become insecure. said in another way, miners could be rolling in money today, but it may not be necessary. So in the unlikely event that mimers will be making less in the near future (trust me, they wont, 2020 is next halving, and i wouldnt be surprised if price is even higher by then and blocks perhaps even larger.) so even IF, and thats a big IF, miner revenue goes down, difficulty adjusts, and the network wont become insecure.
@_date: 2017-02-14 08:43:46

@_date: 2017-02-20 22:15:17
The question is wether bitcoin price is driven by speculators or by actual demand. By actual demand i mean people who buy and use it, and dont just hold it because they think the price will go up. If bitcoin is more a speculative asset, then a ETF no could be devastating. But if bitcoin is used for something, and thats what driving the price, then a ETF no wont affect price much :P Thats what im thinking.

I guess the discussion boils down to wether or not the blockchain should attempt to accomodate world trade, or not. Which i think it shouldnt, since its far to ineffecient. I believe staying at 1mb is fine. And that 3rd party transactors will move around it by building competitive off-chain transactions networks. This is a scary thought to some, because of the problems there have been with paypal etc. And because it goes against the nature of bitcoin.  But the bitcoin off-chain transaction market is bound to be much more competitive than the fiat, and i see it as the only way forward too. The transactions that need to be on the blockchain, can still be on the blockchain, but it will be more expensive than an off-chain transaction. It would be significantly more secure, and significantly more censorship resistant, which will weigh out the cost. Just to be clear, if the block size isnt increased, it will likely lead to people bidding on being included in the next block via the transaction fees. And as bitcoin becomes more relevant/popular, the fees will become higher and higher. 3rd party companies will move in with off-chain transactions, for people that dont need the security and censorship resistance of the blockchain. And if you are just buying a pizza, you really dont. And even if you want to, you still can by using the blockchain and paying the approriate fee, which no doubt will be more expensive than the off-chain provider can do.

They are wrong imo. Blockchain transactions are expensive compared to other payment methods, for example paypal. We dont notice the true cost yet because transactions are subsidized by new coins being created to pay the miners for processing the transactions.  It is expected as the miner reward decreases transaction fees goes up, which puts a limit to how small you realistically can send.
On the other hand, off-chain transactors can make it much cheaper, if the regulation doesent kill the off-chain bitcoin transaction market, there is going to be plenty competition ensuring as little as possible get screwed, frozen accounts etc. And if you do, simply switch to the other guy. In theory, at least. Gl hf.

Imho miners are the ignorant ones if they think they can somehow make arrangements with Core to hardfork bitcoin. It is an absurd and arrogant position to take. Because who is going to take the blame when the hardfork turns out to be contentious? Not the miners, even tho they were the ones infuencing Core to do it. Core will take the blame. Long story short if you think hardforks are easy you are ignorant, if you think Core controls bitcoin you are ignorant. So if you want scale, you take what you can get. Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

Well maybe it is, but in the event anyone want to change that, it will be changed to something sensible as to not upset the stability of the currency i imagine.
Tiny edit. I presumed it wont be before a long time block rewards will be signficantly low, like 2-3 per block, but i think it will already be that low in 2026. and 1.5 in 2030.
Still, if a decision is made to increase the reward - if its even possible - it will be changed to something benign for the well being of the currency i  imagine.

With the FBI pressuring Apple to create backdoors in their phones, i wouldnt be surprised i they are also all over Bitcoin. Its a system that is antithetical do how FBI works. They are certainly using a portion of their budget and man power to try and take it down. And i wouldnt be surprised if Armstrong and Gavin is taking queues for what to put on their blogs from a division within the FBI tasked with distrupting and perhaps taking down bitcoin:)
I mean does it really sound that far out that its some peoples job to divide the bitcoin community in order to try and take bitcoin down?
The problem with FBI is that it is literately the shadow government of the US. They have an enourmous budget and powers because of the anti-terrorism legislation. They have rogue agents, im sure they have "rogue" departments that is tasked with taking down bitcoin. And they do it in secret, because thats just how FBI operates. 
If the FBI wanted they could take any individual down. They are experts in manipulation, extortion and so on, and they have acces to practically every information about you. And i wouldnt be surprised if they had a talk with gavin or armstrong. either pressuring them into helping them, or making a good deal thats too good to decline. FBI have probably followed the bitcoin community for years, they screen individuals that might be of use, and approach the ones they suspect are most susceptible to corruption and break down and scare away the ones that are not.

May as well keep the block size at 1mb because 20mb wont be enough either. By keeping it at 1mb the blockchain will grow slower - this is good, since its bound to exist for a long time.
It will also allow the market to compete with blockchain transactions if fees are going to increase as a result of the block size limit being reached, and people bid up the transaction fee to get in the next block.
All in all, raising to 20mb wont solve the problem, it will only postpone it. Eventually more and more transactions are going to move off-chain because 1) its going to be more expensive to make blockchain transactions if the transaction fee increase when the block rewards falls.  and 2) because the blockchain wont be able to handle every day transactions of any significant amount anyway. It should not try to either because we dont need to put on the blockchain a transaction that was used to purchase a coffee or tip someone with.

Petamine mines via GHash.io. Miners pooling together is not = centralization. In this day and age the only way to profit from mining is to pool together. Solo mining will get very few people anything. The catch is miners take calculated risks and i think they will be pushing it further and further. As long as GHash.io keeps perfmorning as splendidly as they have so far, miners will choose them over the alternative. I think GHash.io could reach &gt;50% and miners would still support them, but only for as long as the pool keeps operating honestly.

There is little correlation between bitcoin block size and bitcoin adoption.  The nature of the blockchain has worked against adoption, it is one of peoples biggest criticisms. WHY DOES A TX TAKE 10 MINUTES?
Its more due to the fact that we have huge exchanges, casinos and tipping services that adoption is increasing and those are all based on off-chain transaction solutions.

I thought that was an excellent interview. Trace Mayer brings up some interesting facts. 
I was about to subscribe to the idea that Bitcoin supply is inelastic and that could influence the price positively even if it is currently inflating at a constant rate. But the supply that actually matters, is the supply on the exchanges. And this is an elastic supply. For example, there is an abundance of Bitcoin on the exchanges at the moment, because ETH has been doing so well, and people have been making loads of BTC. So there is an oversupply of BTC because everyone is making money on ETH it seems. This causes downward pressure on BTC-Fiat price, because fiat is still the go-to currency if you want to consume. And the people who took profit, are expected to cash some of it out. Which is why BTC-&gt;Fiat is likely going down. However, in the beginning when ETH peaked, it was some serious drops. People didnt care, they just wanted some cash, right now. But right now, it seems they are timing it. Everytime there is a top, there is a sell.  The next phase will be, that every time there is a top, there is going to hodling instead, because most of the excess BTC will have changed hands into the hodlers.

I would just like to add that regardless of how you are going to achive increased on-chain capacity, wallets and nodes would have to update to accomodate the changes in throughput. The benefits of doing it via a softfork is that people dont have to update in advance, they can do it at their own pace, which is a benefit for a decentralized system like bitcoin tbh.

Making scores private is one of the best things that happened to this sub, because the bitcoin leftists cannot humilate you by downvoting your post. So controversial opinions have to be met with an adequate response, which the bitcoin leftist/alarmist cant do. So the conversation becomes more productive, rather than a game to downvote and humilate others for their opinions and possibly facts and evidence that dont suit their agenda. My point is, thats why r/btc is full of certain types and basically an echo chamber. Private scores is not in their interest because they need the point system to decide which opinion they should have and how they should think. You know what i mean?

Basically the argument boils down to nodes could run out of memory if transaction queues get too long? This seems like it could be avoided by making changes to the software nodes run on.

Central banks can do this. But central banks cannot know the demand for their currency. They can create money out of thin air, and give it to the banks when they want it, of course at the same time they debase the existing money in the econony. Thats why there is no need for someone to regulate the supply. He cannot know the true demand, and if, by inflating the currency, by attempting to meet demand, he only makes the remaining money worse, creating even more demand. Y'kno.

Where you are getting that from. 4mb blocksize limit is in the pipes, people are working on dynamic solutions too. Segregated witness is going to allow even more transactions on chain. Finally you have LN and possibly complete off-chain solutions in the not so distant future that people may use, which gives people a choice so they arent forced to use the chain, allowing for even more space on chain.
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:22:33
Creating a blocksize debate in bitcoin was the best thing anyone trying to split the community can do. Because the blocksize is a relatively arbitrary number that its bound to split people.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:07:10
I think that would get complicated :) One of the things that makes segwit interesting is the economic incentive that comes with it. as far as i understand, the more people that use segwit, from the networks perspecitve, the better. so when it comes with an economic incentive to use it, most if not all people would eventually transition.  but best of all, it provides a means to increase blocksize without too much complication. so why not do it? i mean if we can increase blocksize with segwit, why not? :) whats the downside.
regarding the miner signalling, it makes sense to lower it a bit at first glance. but in reality there wouldnt be much difference between 80% and 95%. I dont think thats whats keeping miners from signalling. If we could get 80% of the miners to signal, the rest would follow pretty fast i imagine. The problem is getting the ball rolling in the first place. And it may not be due to ulterior motives, i mean its possible that the incentive from miners just isnt there to upgrade, which is why these flag day ideas have merit on some level.

Im not sure i understand what you mean. But the so called coffee drinkers would not not blame the blockchain or bitcoin if they are standing at the cashier and cant pay. This responsibility is the off-chain payment provider. Besides i dont think blockchain transactions are reliable enough to serve the coffee drinkers or any situations that require instant purchase. So why are we trying to make room in the blockchain for these?

Lightning and sidechains are definitely going to be more tested, and more trusted in the future. And the blocksize limit will probably be higher, and maybe even dynamic. 
I mean, we may even have paypal and these sort of companies on board. There is no telling what a majority of bitcoin users will use to transact bitcoin in the future.

Thats an astrounding statement. I get surprised regularly when i realise who accepts bitcoin, and how its otherwise being used. There is that market place where people buy and sell skins from PC games and chose Bitcoin as payout. I think it was $40,000 per day going in and out in bitcoin. When you look at transaction count alone on the blockchain you will see that transaction demand basically at an all time high.

Its not a matter of displaying potential valuation, its a matter of displaying potential risk of hardfork. The lower price is, the better. And by putting a date on the end, the instrument is basically showing the risk of bitcoin hardforking before end of the year. Because the valuation is sort of low, we can speculate that the risk of a hardfork is low so far. This is useful for people who hold bitcoin, but are concerned about a hardfork.

Imo blockchain transactions should cost more than a dollar, this is to encourage people to not be wasteful, and find other means of using bitcoin when possible. Its also to keep a steady flow of income for miners when the block rewards disappear. But even in that case i think the institutions are saving money even if they have to make a transaction every block and pay a dollar or more. Btw. if they have to make a transaction every block, what happens if they miss a few? Doesent the idea go away if they still have to verify(?) every 10 mins

The road to hell is paved with good intentions. And people have different ideas of what bitcoin is, presumambly. To the miners its just a cash cow. And here is how they most likely think. They see the mempool at 50,000 transactions. They work so hard to find a block, and when they finally do, they can only put 2,000 transactions in it. In their mind thats a waste. But the protocol wouldnt work for long without a limit on the number of transactions per block, and due to the nature of the network this limit is difficult to change. Its by design.
Everyone wants to take a shortcut in order to change the limit, but the consequences of that are worse than the benefits. We will find out one way or the other. Either SegWit passes and BU goes away. Everything will be fine. Core was right. Or, BU passes and bitcoin is replaced by it, and it slowly dies. Core was right again.

"We" should not try and force what bitcoin is on the protocol layer. If some people believe it can be a currency they will built payment systems on top. Right?

@_date: 2015-05-07 18:27:48
Delayed transaction is an interesting concept. In the end it just means you didnt pay a high enough fee. And oh my god, of course you are going to vote for free stuff. You want the block size to increase so you can keep paying little to no fees. But its bad for the network as a whole. Thats whats gonna hurt bitcoin.

Its not certain that miner revenue increases as a result from increased blocksize. Because as you mention if the block space gets crowded people are going to bid on getting into blocks. This could also lead to increased miner revenue. Wont bigger blocksize mean miners will have bigger expenses when it comes to bandwith and harddrive storage? if that is the case the miners will have bigger expenses, while arguably the revenue stays the same.

Imo bitcoin is a settlement layer by default. You can try to make it not into a settlement layer by not caring about blocksize, but bitcoin will just be worn down then.
Ultimately the only difference between "settlement layer" and "day to day transaction system" is the amount of fees each transaction pays. I dont see how higher or lower fees paid per transaction change dynamics or incentives at all. Please elaborate on that point if you can.

Compared to what? 


Maybe blocksize will be set free. But that is significantly more controversial than increasing to 2 or 4mb.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:46:46
Someone said the question to blocksize cant be answered. And i agree. But i believe staying at 1mb is most sensible for the next while. Its good for miners, and its good for the off-chain transaction market. Both miners and off.chain transaction systems will play a key role in the success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:35:25
And Core will wait until there is conensus, which is the correct approach. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:12:17
Whoa. Nice.


Im looking at you, miners.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:16:48
The fees are pretty high atm. they are actually almost 3x as high as what you paid. So what you can do is you can use this transaction accelerator 
~~ actually i just realised that accelerator is a scam.
I know there is a method called Child Pays For Parent as well which should be used because transaction accelerators will only work until everyone start using them (which will be fast). But you would have to look up how to do child pays for parent because i never used it before and cant explain it. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:07:12


This is false


In case you havent noticed, this isnt such a big deal to many people. Fast and inexpensive is not the apealing thing here.  And i think miners will find that out if they try to change bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:43:14

I dont mind several chains. But i dont want BTC to be replaced. For example the BTU people could fork and create their own chain. It would be very safe, and probably bitcoin wouldnt care too much. Then we would have two chains and tokens to trade against each other. I dont see a problem with that. If we tried to replace bitcoin instead of simply providing an alternative, you are playing a much more dangerous game imo.

I dont see how the cost for the transactor is 0. He is counting on getting the 25 BTC reward on top of the transaction fees. If it wasnt for the 25 BTC reward, he wouldnt be doing it. If you told miners they could only keep the transaction fees from now, unless the transaction fees increase to &gt;25 BTC total per block, they would stop mining.

Yea? And lets say you bought a house. When it turns out it was a double spend. You have a house. And they will take it away. It makes no sense to do it. Even if someone does it, like, for shits and giggles. That 1 time is going to make the attack less succesful next time because the network will be more alert for stuff like that. So in my opinoin its not a threat to the network. Its a minor inconvenience at best, and only to the individual parties involved, who can even wait for 6 confirmations or more, to protect themselves. I mean even if the fee is 50BTC on the transaction you just recieved you will notice that something is up. Do you know what i mean?

Its not even a year since the last rally. Before the rally in early 2013 it had been 2 years since the last one. That was the rally in 2011. You understand what im saying?
The problem seems to be you and others do not have realistic expectations. Bitcoin cannot exceed an exchange rate of over $1000 less than a year after it did previously, which again was an ATH almost 5 times higher than 6 months before. You understand? Bitcoin is overheated, but, it is still worth more than it was a year ago. Much, much more if you go back further.

Make your own coin, and apply your regulation to that and if no-one will use it because of your draconian measures, tough luck, but stay the fuck away from bitcoin please

@_date: 2017-03-05 19:15:23
Its important to note that nobody is in charge of bitcoin. So nobody can pivot it into anything like so. This is really the market doing this to itself. I can understand why some people wouldnt want to use bitcoin for day to day transactions if they had to pay like $1 for a transaction, but how essential is this to bitcoin? Im sure we will see the real payment apps and startups anytime soon. Real wallets that allow users to interchange bitcoin without publishing a transaction to the chain. It will be so much cheaper and more convenient. So thats where most of the transactions and activity will go i think and thats why im still hodling even tho fees are this high.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:27:42
I dont understand how you can say transaction fees are effectively 0 without taking into account the block reward. You dont have to tell me that 0.0001 BTC is effectively 0, but the reason the fee is 0.0001 is most likely because of the 25 btc that get added on top of that. You wont have a bitcoin network to begin with if it wasnt for the block rewards. You must include it when calculating the cost imo.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:48:57
If most of those transactions can be moved to off-chain networks or solutions that would be great.

This chart is misleading i think. I believe it shows the total share of hashrate. So even if Antpool hashrate stayed the same, it meant that other pools have been growing. But Antpool/bitmain could also be adding hashrate under different poolnames to create an illusion of decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:53:44
How do you know they will? Some nodes may reject it, others wont. Eventually the nodes that didnt accept it would have to, because a portion of the network already did and whoops 5-10 minutes later new block found, its built on top, no going back now.

Why cant they just have their thing? I dont mind. I know that that sub culture wont be able to damage bitcoin. The truth wins in the end, and the alarmists and conspiracy theorists do not have truth on their side. You know what i mean? There is no reason for trying to engage with the alarmist not even spend a minute engaging with him. Unless other people are watching. Then you have the chance to sway opinion. But thats the problem.

Bitcoin either gonna moon or doom this year.
Once you realise bitcoin price is severely depressed because of ETH, where whales in particular have been taking their 400-900% Bitcoin profits and cashing it out.... Causing other people to exit to fiat... You will understand that Bitcoin is basically a loaded spring about to pop up in everyones face as it sucks all that fiat back and more.
Think of it this way. If you increased your BTC even 100%, and when it comes to ETH, people have made upwards of 900%. You want to celebrate. So you take your newly aquired Bitcoin from polo, to whichever exchange you prefer, and cash that bitcoin the fuck out. You dont care if bitcoin is dropping 15%. You are not even going to setup a limit order. That shit will be cashed out, market sold. Because you made bank. This has been what people have been doing collectively, and it depresses the bitcoin to fiat exchange rate, because not only is there an abundance of bitcoin wanting to exit to fiat, it causes your average bitcoin hodler to also exit to fiat. But only temporary. All that money+more is going to be sucked right back in, in the very near future. Have a good day.

Wow. Where to start. Holy fuk.
First of all it would not be in their economic interest to mine empty blocks. Second of all, by mining on the chain they dont like they are increasing its hashrate, reducing the likelyhood it will be a minority chain. And by mining empty blocks they forfeit the fees to legitimiate miners, which simply attracts more of them to that chain.

@_date: 2017-03-25 04:14:33
imo forcing is the wrong word. miners can continue mining legacy blocks, by not including segwit based transactions and nodes that dont understand segwit type transactions will continue to function. UASF only kicks off segwit so that the miners who ready can start mining segwit transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-01 20:58:05
Bitcoin cant handle everyones transactions at once. So it sorts them according to who pays the highest fee. I presume the network decided that your fee was so low that it didnt even stand a chance to be included, so you got the money back.

The thing about ethereum is if its just a smart contract platform it wont be much different than any smart contract platform. And if smart contracts are going to be a thing Etherum will not have a monopoly. Anyone could start a smart contract platform, perhaps institutions prefer private blockchains here. Arguably Ethereum is a private chain since its controlled by 1 dev, who even recently fired alot of devs. Anyway, i had no problem buying and holding ETH because it could increase my BTC holdings because of the rally, so it was a no brainer, but betting on its practical use and long term holding is too risky i think. To each their own i guess :)

@_date: 2015-05-07 07:19:12
Keep the blocksize at 1mb until we know the true demand for a block size increase. Today people use the blockchain to gamble, to purchase coffee and tip each other. Imo that is incorrect use because if everyone did that, the network couldnt handle it.
We will know the true demand for a blocksize increase once we have viable off-chain payment systems. When people have a choice to pay someone in bitcoin without using the blockchain, then we can see what the demand will be for a blocksize increase. Until then, i dont think we should increase it, because people will get into the wrong habits. We may encourage the size of the blockchain to grow too fast.
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:56:35
So if the block size isnt increased, and transaction fees are going to rise, people are going to use another crypto currency? That is an interesting point. But doesent bitcoin already have higher fees than other cryptos?

@_date: 2016-03-22 12:07:26
The question boils down to wether blocksize limit should adapt to how big blocks miners want to mine. Sort of like the difficulty adjusts according to how much hashing power miners are adding. But at least with difficulty there is a target. 10 minute block intervals. Whereas with adaptive blocksize, there seems to be no target. grrr

If miners want to hardfork bitcoin and spend hundreds of millions of dollars attacking any chain they do not like thats their choice. But its going to be a waste of money because people will just route around their efforts.
Nevertheless if anyone is going to hardfork bitcoin i hope its after the bitcoin ETF is approved. Since the ensuing price volatility from such an event could jeopadise its approval.

what concerns me is which miner will shut down last. If its bitmain they will have all the hashpower and could kill a chain. Even if there is a PoW change, the hashrate would start out so small that bitmain could probably still kill it with a GPU mine of theirs. The only victory for bitcoin as far as i can see is if bitmain goes broke before they can replace it and who knows what kind of backers they have.
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:12:34
rogers argument is that bitcoin is failing because alts are soaring, but guess what. Roger is pumping alts himself and he is spreadihg bitcoin fud, he probably plays a large role in alts soaring. But instead he blames blockstream which is so random. he blames core because they favor 1mb blocksize limit. but guess what, last year core 13.1 was released and it supports 4mb blocks. but its not usable yet because miners are not supporting it. and guess what, rogers pool is not either. so do roger think we are stupid? hes kind of responsible but blames others.

It would be nice if armstrong dug deeper to get a better understanding of the devs because it seems he barely scratched the surface of what they think. I mean it seems like he wasted a great oppertunity here to get to know them.
Besides what makes armstrong such an expert in what kind of devs a crypto currency needs? Why is he even sticking around if he believes things are so bad, why not create his own coin, he must have the means to at least get a good dev team together, im not sure on his own skills when it comes to developing crypto currencies. I mean this is literately the best thing he could do. But he is only 1 step better than me in that regard. He actually has a company, but still prefers to sit at home typing up stuff, that isnt going to make any difference in the end but probably likes to think it will. 
So Armstrong, lead the way if you think you know whats up. Assemble the dev team, and create your dream crypto currency.

Are you dumb? If a company didnt support segwit why would they go out of the way to support it and put their names on the list? Whats the matter with you?


If the hashrate hardforks, companies will go against it by default. And its a shitty situation to put the companies in to begin with, and most have not voiced their opinions yet. But gdax/coinbase have already stated they will not list BTU as BTC.  
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:13:26
As someone who dont have old coins, im fine wtih this change. Why should old coins get priority? It would be an ineffeciency in the fee market as far as i can see.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:12:37
The BCU token is supposed to be worthless in the eyes of BTU'ers. Because that could mean the chain wont split, and BTU will just replace bitcoin. Of course it could also mean that BU will be completely abandonded and it wont replace anything, or even exist as an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:39:23
We should just let bitcoin run its course. If someone creates something that is better, all power to them. PS im hodling bitcoin atm and i dont expect that to change any time soon.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:19:43
Same. Im turning bearish on bitcoin. But maybe people wont care, and wont sell. But those who are worried about a contentious fork will, however many they are.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:16:44
I think SegWit stands the biggest chance because it has the most consensus. BU have a long way ahead of them if they want to achive the same status as SegWit.

The attack will only work for as long as they keep it up i imagine. Network will recover once it stops.


They dont, but the less hashrate they use, the less of an effect they will have.


If a split happens people will have coins on both chains. There wont be any switching per say.

This is sort of the same question as who will build the roads. We dont have a definitive answer but we know if there is a demand someone will build it as cheap as possible. Right?
When it comes to bitcoin if there is demand for 200k tx per second someone will try to make that happen as cheap and secure as possible. Of course given the scale of the problem or scenario it is likely something that will be achived by numerous companies working together...?
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:16:39
buisness as usual?
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:58:09


Because they are self-interested and greedy. They want cheap fees and they will be willing to harm bitcoin to get it.


These polls are redicolous. They can be gamed. And BU has biggest incentive to manipulate these polls because their software cant compete with Core. You have to keep in mind it caters to a specific group of people. The group that will lie, cheat and exploit as evidenced by their actions and constant fud etc.


This subreddit is a result of the support Core has, its not the other way around. This sub supports Core because its great.  Its the free market at work.

The only criticism i have heard of segwit is that it reserves a small portion of the coinbase. But im not sure how big of a deal it is. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:38:26


No im not, actually. As far as i can tell you can only postpone higher fees, because blocksize cannot be unbounded. There IS a limit wether we like it or not. Its a tradeoff between decentralization and centralization. So when i see people want to increase blocksize to make fees cheap, it doesent accomplish much.  Also have to keep in mind that even 32mb blocks is only about 112 TPS. Visa does 25,000 TPS. So no matter what, bitcoin is destined to scale on second layer.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:14:57
Well at some point the market wants scale i imagine. And this ant-pool shenanigans means it wont come easy anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:30:22
Yes i do. Miners delibaretely not signalling segwit dont know whats good for themselves. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:42:51
What if, what if? They could test their software on testnet as well. SegWit is already active there.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:47:06
nah they just mining their own buisness. just decentralized currency things. actually bitcoin is starting to look more and more like a giant bureaucracy. think about it.

Reddit pundits are actually pretty smart. But whats your outlook? SegWit in 6 months or BU, or none?
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:23:37
I think BU is designed to waste everyones time and i think its succeeding at that

Why does people think segwit is not a good idea? What do they think is bad about it?
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:42:22
Anything that would go wrong would be isolated to that specific network. Bitcoins bottom layer wont be affected. On the otherwise if you start changing the protocol into something resembling a high throughput network, if something does go wrong, all is lost tbh.

This is not acurate. Community is in favor of segwit, but miners are giving it the cold shoulder. This is why miners are likely to get fired.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:46:53
But what is the reason to put segwit on the spot like that?

SegWit gives immediate relief and paves the way for even more immediate relief :)

@_date: 2017-03-09 09:50:10
This is good. The ETF is not that important, but please correct me if im wrong. The important thing is that buisnesses are ok and find bitcoin useful.
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:18:43
It depends on how you look at it. A straight blocksize doubling removes the fee pressure over night i would imagine. It would take several months to get it back to current level.
With the segwit approach the fee pressure doesent vanish overnight, because not everyone will be using segwit from day 1. So it will be a smoother transition. There may be a period in the beginning with slightly lower fee pressure tho. But it is bound to ramp up over time. Please keep in mind that the individual who choose to use segwit will see a benefit right away. (Between $0.08 and $0.30 saved for a 1 input 2 output tx)
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:47:45
What do you mean?

Not with that attitude :)

Just leave bitcoin as is and start BTU as an alternative. Its much simpler. If BTU gains popularity you will just have more people start using it and BTC will slowly fade away. It is the safest way to scale.

I am saying that bitcoin is not simply a transaction system. It shouldnt be used for simple transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:32:29


This is a bad interpretation on so many levels. First of all, the blocksize will not be discovered on-chain. You are going to have thousands of nodes signalling different things. There will never be convergance. So someone will have to call the shots and every time the blocksize is increased nodes will be thrown of the network. They may not be economically significant nodes, but they are a nodes none the less and I dont see a trustless and censorship resistant bitcoin without users being able to run nodes. How will they do payments without relying on a 3rd party then? Do you know what i mean?

I dont know what the medical term is, but Roger Ver seems to have tunnel vision. He's convinced that he is the only one that cares about bitcoin and that cheap on-chain fees are essential for crypto currencies, but what gave him that idea?
How hard is it to imagine a mobile app that allows thousands of bitcoin transactions per second between users that anyone can download and use. Why isnt he funding these kinds of startups? I think hes losing it and squandering his money on what i would describe as a smear campaign and the irony is he thinks he is the good guy when in reality he is contributing nothing of value.

Not necceserily. Bitcoin can still be digital gold, the reserve currency, no matter how fancy the new technologies are.

Not quite. As long as the legacy blocks are not malicious, by for example trying to steal segwit outputs, then segwit nodes do not care if a block specifically "signals" segwit or not. Please correct me if im wrong.

@_date: 2017-03-06 10:59:22
Before wallets have figured out how to do fees correctly, they will have moved completely off-chain in the first place. :) I think its just a matter of time before someone develops an off-chain transaction standard that wallets can use. Oh and then settle coins between them every now and then.

Bitcoin has mastered the art of cryptocurrency, its lack of incidents and stunning market cap makes it look easy.

Lets just replace bitcoin with BU, what could go wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:07:23
is this a serious question?
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:25:41
Well the BU threat is putting a damper on the bitcoin rally. This should be a signal that miners should stop taking matters into their own hands. Let the protocol evolve organically and recognize the tremendous support for segwit and get ready. Otherwise they will just run bitcoin into the ground im afraid.
Honestly, not signalling BU is better than signalling it, if you dont like SegWit. Because the market gets worried of hardfork and split. Its an irrational move to signal BU from a miner point of view.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:15:49
Ok lets take it from the start. When satoshi spoke about nodes, he spoke about miners. They were one and the same back then. Do we have miners in datacenters now? Yep. Do they decide which ledger is the real one? Nope.
Second of all, what kind of expectations do you have to bitcoins on-chain capacity? A ball park figure on amount of tps, and what size block would be required. When you think about those things i think you will realise that scaling on-chain to any satisfactiry degree is not that interesting (Its impossible).

Its closed minded. The reason the blocksize limit debate is so hot is because it seems simple enough for people to understand. So it becomes the main problem and main concern of bitcoin because its the easiest to relate to. But that does not mean it is the biggest problem. This is why i think its silly to suggest lowering the blocksize limit or even fudge the numbers regarding block times, when we have a block size limit and a block interval that seem to work fine right now.
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:05:53

Imo the radical thing is to reject segwit given it has so much testing and so much support. SegWit itself also is not that radical. The transaction format it introduces would have to be adopted by wallets and exchanges but many are already ready. We are only waiting on miners to signal, and i have no idea what the hold up is.

All of them. Most developers are in favor, alot of companies are in favor, alot of users, alot of nodes etc. Are you really deyning segwit has huge support? I mean SegWit support may not be loud and obnoxious and in your face like BU, but its there and its quite significant.
For example this a small list of companies in support.
* Bitfinex
* BitGo
* Bitwala
* Blockchain.info
* Coinbase
* Electrum
* Gemini
* Keepkey
* Trezor
* Ledger
* Localbitcoins
* Mycelium

I have this silly theory that if bitmain can create the threat of a hardfork it may discourage competing miners in upgrading their operation.

Unfortunately miners are like "NO. No more transactions for you" by not signalling segwit so we can goddamn activate it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:45:44
Even bitcoin unlimiters know BU is not the right thing. They just promote it to get attention.

Its hard to explain. I guess there are several factors. But Bitcoin price is currently depressed because whales in particular have been making so much BTC from ETH, and in turn selling that on the exchanges to enjoy some R&amp;R.

Sorry for being so abrupt, but who cares?
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:29:01
I cant believe people are still pushing that narrative. I took a quick look at BU and i understood immediately that the blocksize will not be market based. Either it will never change, or it will change when a conglomerate of miners start mining larger blocks. Has nothing to do with a market based blocksize. Come on.
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:10:51
Its their job.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:09:09
I cant wait to see how the blocksize debate will unfold in a BU coin if it has any transactions... Miners yelling at each other, exchanges panicking, chain splitting, and general lack of confidence because of emergent consensus
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:11:52
Yes, something like that. One thing is for miners to signal hardforks when there was no solution from core. Its another thing is to completely ignore core's solution and continue pushing for a hardfork. It puts a a damper on things imo.

Core can do whatever they want. They are not anyones to command. Imagine if i came to your house and asked you to give me $100 dollars. And then you dont, even tho i ask repeatedly. And then i complain that you dont even want to compromise and give me $5 dollars. Makes no sense.

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:17:35


Are you high or something? What do you think has been going on the last few years?
It is just as likely that nobody will do any reasearch on blocksize and just accept whatever the miners feel like mining. Path of least resistance. I mean do you expect miners to care? Why would they? They will just include more and more transactions. They wont be doing research or any of that stuff. They will just fill blockspace more and more because they can. OR they wont do it at all, a case can be made for that as well i guess. But if you give the miners power and expect them to not abuse it you are going to have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:42:43
I think it would be good to have a PoW change ready, but i dont think it should be used preemtively. Let a miner attack first, see how bad it gets, and then deploy the PoW change if absolutely necceseray.

@_date: 2017-03-09 05:48:20
instead of raising the blocksize you could build a buisnes that worked like coimbase but the wallet would not send payment to others on-chain. something like seem infinitely scalable.

UASF is like trump saying "im just fulfilling my promise to the voters" in response to the travel ban. 
He is using the power the voters gave him to do the things they gave it to him for. Same with UASF. If enough people have upgraded to a segwit compatible node and announced support, its just a matter of Core saying on x date it will activate. What are the miners going do to? Softforks are a very powerful upgrade mechanism.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:33:07
Right now yes. The negative interest is miniscule. But they may go lower and lower. And the costs will be pushed over to the consuma. So companies, at least some, will be going oh hey hey hey, we accept bitcoin. hey. hey, we accept bitcoin over here. hey

I agree that BU may have some problems. But on top of that, since its a hardfork, it is not possible to activate soon. Will take more time and lots of negotiation and signalling and probing consensus until it can activate. And its off to a bad start because many people have criticized its emergent consensus, and the critical bugs lately do not help them either.

Do you really expect the internet to use clunky unreadable adresses, 10 minute confirmations times and more, plus exorbitant fees, in commerce? No, it wont. It will build transaction layers on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin will be the unit of account and store of value and its on sale right now.

But what is the market demand? What do people see in bitcoin? Cheap fees is most likely not it and it could be achived with second layers , all crypto currency would have to do this as far as i can see. 
The growing alt-coin market cap can be explained by two things. 1) the smear campaign against bitcoin and the full block fear. 2) people who want more risk and potential reward than holding bitcoin

@_date: 2017-03-16 07:19:50
ok thanks for the tip
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:23:17
Bigger blocks will not allow for more use cases tho. Its simply a bailout for status quo. As soon as you increase blocksize, blocks start filing up again, fees start rising. Enabling new use cases requires new methods, new technology and means to transact. Those are just my 50 cents.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:44:00


Why would you assume that? Wouldnt it make more sense to assume that SegWit support would be much larger if its about to activate?
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:23:04


Everyone should take heed of this. I still think bitcoin is a buy. But when things start to get real crazy, you sell and buy back lower. Pay attention to your own feelings. When you are being blown away by price and start feeling euphoric, sell. Ok? Good luck, it starts next week.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:25:15
If one more pool would join segwit JUST ONE MORE, then  that would be a huge relief and it will put Jihan and Co in a bad spot i imagine. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:41:30




lolol this was before pooled mining and asics. you still dont get that. bitcoin is not like it was when satoshi was around. it has changed. If 50%+ of the miners fork without the network, they will create an alt-coin.


If bitcoin had contentious forked we would likely not be at gold parity today. Furthermore SegWit has been available for months, but miners wont signal for it. They are the final piece of the puzzle to unlock greater on-chain capacity but they wont. Again, trust me. 6 months will pass and we will still have 1mb max blocksize. And the only group to blame is the miners for delibartely not signalling segwit despite the network being ready for it since last year.

the nakamoto consensus is not that big of a deal. It doesent matter what 50%+ of the miners signal if the network nodes do not.
and to be honest consensus is difficult to measure. It has no defined scale imo. But you can look at twitter, you can look at which companies support, you can look at reddit, you can look at the development community etc. There is broad support for SegWit compared to for example BU
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:06:45


This is sophistry. First of all bitcoin unlimited is contentious, it will never achive bigger blocks unless it splits off. So even if BTU people say they are in favor of large blocks and the network is suffering and so on, their actions lead to status quo. Dont you realise this?
@_date: 2017-02-04 03:05:29
I dont think what you are doing is worth it (but what do i know) when you consider fees and spreads. Much easier to just pay $0.5 to get a high prio tx on bitcoin. And if its not high prio you can get away with paying half or even less.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:55:46
No, actually this guy isnt trying to hide at all. He is using the same address and chaining the tx over and over with &gt;300 satoshi/byte fee. But i dont see what the point is.

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:33:10
Please note that in scenario number two miners who stay on bitcoin will be earning the excact same as before unless bitcoin price tanks. But as with every other "disaster" the bitcoin price bounces back. I think the miners who chose to stay have the least to lose.
Even if bitcoin mining will seem more centralized after a large chunk of miners possibly leave, it would be safe to assume the remaining ones would be honest because it does not seem like the incentive to be dishonest against the chain you prefer is bigger after a split.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:41:56

@_date: 2017-03-09 11:41:23
They could also lobby them and say they will never pay $1 fees again. Even tho that probably wont be true. Also the network would split, and mining would become highly centralized. You probably have a hard time coming back from that.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:16:24
But i think that bitcoin cannot sustain growth in on-chain transactions. And the bad actors are exploiting this unawareness as a spearhead to destroy bitcoin. If they can convince that Core is evil, they can change the protocol to anything they like. Its highly annoying. And cant seem to find any comforting solution atm. except for companies building on top of bitcoin and users using those companies instead of on-chain payments. When the protocol is separated from end users like redditors i think things will become productive again.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:13:23
It depends on how its executed. For example if you tried to replace BTU with Bitcoin, you would have a bad time. But if BTU started as an alternative chain and slowly grew, even if it used the same UTXO set, it would be a completely different story imo. Much safer.

Meanwhile bitcoin core 0.14.0 is about to be released with nifty new features. Last year they proposed an upgrade that would increase capacity and pave the way for even better ways to transact bitcoin. But miners like Jihan will not get ready for it, so the network cant activate it. This makes Jihan the one who is acting like a dictator, colluding to attack, and is the biggest threat to long term development.
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:41:12

It sets a bad precedent. And imo there are spammers out there who are willing to spend alot of money. So as soon as we get 2mb blocks, they gonna be full rather quick again. And then what? War starts over?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:22:15
Imo they are welcome to fork to a different chain. If 99% of hashrate leaves to something else, thats just sad. I will move on. But if the split is more like 75% / 25% and the real chain has a chance to live on, but the 75% or portion of it, start attacking it, thats when a pow change would have to happen i think.

The bitcoin network is some strange cloud of computers and in order to interact with it you need a client wether you are a miner, hodler or buisness etc. bcoin is one of such clients.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:41:35
the voting process dont have to be formal in order to exist. For example you can be a vocal supporter of segwit. and you have voted. everything else is just a formality. Im serious.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:37:55
paid sock puppets or disgruntled hodlers. either way one should steer clear of them.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:21:15


Yes and no. There are external and internal actors in bitcoin. If the UASF attempt succeeds every internal actor would win. Even if they campaigned for something else. Because the UASF will only be succesful if its good. And it can only be good if it benefits everyone. In the case of SegWit, who wouldnt benefit? It seems like only external actors would lose. External actors are actors that are not involved with bitcoin and whose succes is detrimental to theirs.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:59:51
Is there? Whats the disagreement?
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:27:46
The network effect is based on the price. And the network effect is what gives bitcoin value. So bitcoin doesent have to do much, and there dont have to be alot of companies around it. If it has value, thats all that matters tbh. It could potentially become widely used as money. It already is tho.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:23:41
How is that going to work? You expect everyone to start saying BTL instead of BTC? And for how long? Should all alt-coin pairs be renamed to BTL? For example BTLETH. Dude that was a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:57:58

This is hilarious
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:54:03
haha, an adaptive blocksize is probably never going to work and even someone came up with something that would, blocksize is only part of the puzzle when it comes to increasing tps. For example you could reduce confirmation times. But the problem with BU is that it only focuses on blocksize for the old and buggy transaction formats. It doesent introduce new stuff that actually allow bitcoin to scale. I mean LN wouldnt even work on the BU chain.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:56:12
Only if BU doesent add replay protection
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:03:41
ViaBTC says they will only support the scaling solution that has majority support. But they are not signalling segwit yet, and in fact they went out of their way to signal BU before it had any support. They are retarded.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:19:22
Considering the blockstream core narrative that has been relentlessly pushed on reddit it is ironic that BU is turning into the implementation that is driven by special interests by people like Roger Ver and the monopoly Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:57:21
I heard bitfury was better. And taking a quick glance at bitfurys website they claim to be the best. Bitmain only claim to be the best in the consumer market. I wonder which market is bigger.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:31:51
Probably.  Miners wont fork without the economy in the first place, and i dont see why the economy would follow the miners. If BU really was a great idea it would be adopted by buisneses and hailed by experts. But that does not seem to be the case.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:23:06

No. I specifically chose a comment that had 1 karma, in a thread that was no longer on the frontpage (no-one else likely to be voting on it). Notice i refresh the page by clicking permalink.

@_date: 2017-03-06 20:29:25
nah this wont influence anything like that, they are only signalling so nothing drastic will happen right now. Maybe hodlers will start selling some of their coins as they contemplate what this means for the near future. Who knows.
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:05:49
This sets a precedence for a blocksize limit that must always stay ahead of the network or else things wont work as intended. Im not sure its wise.

What if one side is demonstrably wrong? Is it still good to be neutral?
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:17:42
Do you remember ViaBTC's ama? The hostility toward Core was shocking. And this is a general characteristic from BU fans. Another indication is to look at BU github. When they name variables like blockstream_core_maxblocsize etc. Its non-cooperative and biased and doesent belong in open source.
Another thing is to take a look at the president of bitcoin unlimited. He has been saying for years that Core is crippling bitcoin and price will crash. He is manipulative and hostile. But to be honest its no surprise that guy named is blind to this.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:35:28
Allright fair enough.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:27:43
It will be the blocksize debate on steoroids. With a conglomorate of miners perpetually trying to squeeze larger and larger blocks down the pipe. On principal alone that is a bad idea. Nodes will be peasants to miners.

Are you aware when these parameters become dependent on human configuration per miner and per node you achive the opposite of consensus? Its like shattering a glass in a thousand pieces and then having a huge group of people try to agree how to put it together again.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:08:44
Afaik there is a situation where the BTU could have so much consensus before it forks that it can replace BTC. Then BCU would be worthless and BCC would give "BTU" coins.

Yes, perhaps. But there is no reason for everyone to be so involved. Bitcoin is supposed to be autonomous. SegWit will activate when its needed.

bitcoin theoretical tps is 8-9 tps. but its 3.5 right now because some tx are large. in ethereum the theoretical max is 11-12 tps right now but some transactions, or contracts takes up entire blocks, so its capacity is arguably way lower. so eth being more scalable than btc is a myth. please correct me if im wrong.

Okay. Thats interesting. But the thing about IRL wars is they are fighting to take over governments and tax bases that are already established. And they fund the war with taxes. In bitcoin you dont have taxes, you pay out of own pocket if you want to go to war. And there is nothing for you to gain from a war. Thats the beauty of decentralization. There is no power to fight over, really. Please correct me if im wrong.

Ironically its the price. If its going up, it gets a life of its own. It goes up, because it goes up. This happens regularly in bitcoin. But eventually the price is rising so fast it becomes unsustainable so it crashes. Then the cycle starts over.

Yes thats true. But in the example given with the overhaul, syncing x amount of blocks with an old client -&gt; old client took 8 minutes. Syncing same sequence of blocks with a client with the pull request from another client with the pull request took two minutes. So it have definitely helped.

That depends if people are only interested in the amount of devices mining on a cryptocurrency. I think there is more to in than that, so no, just because you have alot of devices mining a coin, does not mean people will adopt it.

There is already huge support for SegWit, but miners like antpool are reluctant to signal, which is problematic because miners are the remaining piece of the puzzle for activation. So when they signal BU, they make the deadlock worse. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 13:39:21
If bitcoin stayed at $400 from now and the next two years we will have the same amount of people or less working on it and hodling it. A rally is going to attract much needed fresh blood. And im talking hodlers, merchants, developers you name it. Price is more important than you think.

I dont think it matters. The question is wether it will worth to enslave humans rather than live peacefully side by side. I think the robots are going to have a nightmare on their hands if they decide to attempt to rule us. Of course they could take over an existing government, but eventually it will fall and the robots will just decide its not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 07:05:36
Sounds about right. I wonder if we need bigger blocks for that. Probably SegWit will be enough. Anyway, have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:42:08
The only thing that works for BU is the promise of being a permanet scaling solution, that is its only appeal - but so much is sacrificed in order to obtain that, and they never talk about that. If you are scared about what a 1mb blocksize limit means for bitcoin. How are you not scared about what no limit means? How will the network act under such conditions? Seems unsafe. With BU you will probably need 20 confirmations just for your transaction to be secure because consensus is always emerging and you could get orphaned and god knows what..
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:03:28
fyi bitcoin isnt going to make people rich anymore. it can double your money perhaps, but for most people, doubling their money wont make them rich.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:36:22
Its a combination of things. People who were already on the fence of holding btc at this price level definitely werent encouraged by the prospects of SegWit not activating any time soon. I say this because most if not all the criticism of segwit is just fud. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:27:44
But then you realise that BU is not a blocksize increase but a change to how consensus works. Its vastly different than what satoshi had in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:13:31

@_date: 2017-03-01 18:14:07
Even the signalling has value i would argue, specifically when it comes to forks and what percentage of the network is ready. The information isnt useless. I would also argue that it isnt trivial nor cheap to spin up nodes, unless you can spoof it. Syncing the chain requires significant resources at this point in time and anyone who is trying to do it likely wont keep it up for long.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:03:32
Yes, this is purely hypthetical. But lets say BU kept winning over buisnesses, they kept winning over wallets, they kept winning over developers. Eventually they could just say, sorry, we are bitcoin now and we are replacing it on this date, update now. But thats purely hypothetical. And given those circumstances BCC would pay out BTU disguised as BTC. Am i right?
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:34:28
I actually dont think Core is upset about BU. Most of the drama takes place on reddit, by redditors. 
If we go with your analogy Core have been working on adding more pages tbh. They created segwit which not only ads more pages to the newspaper, it turns it into a fucking tablet with internet.

Because the question is wether bitcoin will be around in the future, and wether price is going to be higher than now. And i think thats a pretty safe bet, that both cases will be true. Which is why i dont understand market is stagnant. The obvious answer is that there is more to it than that.
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:59:36


No. Only way this would be the case is if wallets, exchanges etc. also wanted this thing. The miners cannot get it otherwise without creating an alt coin. That is how bitcoin is desgined.

No this is "fucking" stupid. If Core devs bumped to two megs a year ago we would be in the excact same situation as soon as that 2mb block would be full. People need to get in their thick skull that the bottom layer simply wont scale.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:17:27
Look at it from Jihans perspective. He's got it all. Hes gotten as far as he could possibly get in bitcoin. His company is largest in the space, supplying 80% of the globe with mining hardware and building the biggest mines in the world. Whats next? Well, his next challenge is making bitcoin submit to him. Even if he doesent profit from it, he knows he only lives once, so he may as well try, what the fuck else is he going to do with his time? He is not going to play by the rules or obey anything. Sadly for him bitcoin is not to be messed with. He will have a very hard time succeeding.

Problem with this line of reasoning is that it doesent take into account the game theory of PoW. He is basically saying if miners do contentious stuff, things become dangerous. And thats 100% correct. But miners can always do something contentious, but the network is designed to punish it so they wont. Long story short, warning of the risks of contentious action from miners, is like warning of the risks from being hit by an oncomming car on the freeway. Its so small.

what is mining centralization? i think i have a pretty good idea, but eli5 would be great.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:45:14
That is a good point, but i think there is a subtle difference. When you split the coin like BU, the risk will be there. There will be two almost identical chains competing with each other. With a softfork you only have 1 chain so the risk is much less significant. Im also not sure that the coins will be lost on the softforked chain, the nodes would just reject the blocks that would kill their coins and then do a pow change.
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:21:34
Indeed. Bigger blocks are so close, but yet so far.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:36:22
yes. but its opt-in signalling wise. so they can continue to troll.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:29:08
problem with someone announcing a fork gives the impression they control the network. so next they will be lobbied and or forced to do all kinds of other forks. the current approach is more sound albeit slower. the trick is to ignore the drama and understand bitcoin isnt going away any time soon.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:02:42

segwit adoption is pretty significant even before its activated. first of all the development community is in favor, bitcoins most prominent public figures are in favor, exchanges like gemini and coinbase are in favor, wallets like blockchain.info and Electrum are in favor as well as thousands of nodes. Its time to activate it.
*edit* i even forgot to mention that hardware wallets like Trezor and Keepkey also support segwit. So i hope all in all i have provided enough evidence that the economic consensus is supporting at least one side.

@_date: 2017-03-09 16:34:33
well the market will return to normal as soon as it realises that the miners are bluffing. But when the news broke about Antpool alot of people were questioning bitcoins future. But the market is starting to realise that the miners _probably_ wont contentious hardfork and that 1mb blocks will probably be ok.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:08:01

Its not digital gold, its not decentralized. I dont know what it is. Its just an alt.coin. A pump and dump. And bitcoin makes it easy to get and out of it, thats why people take such insane risks with it and pumps it to those levels. Its not because Ethereum is sound, its because Bitcoin is sound and the gateway to and from Ethereum, and further more into TheDAO for that matter is is highly liquid and basically non-restrictive and instant. I expect more of these alt-coin schemes in the future, until the government stops it, and there is an alt-coin approval institution. Because the powers that be cannot watch from the sidelines what is happening. Its going to stop eventually, because alt-coin pumps have gotten so huge and so out of control as bitcoin adoption is growing.

Not a fan of fractional reserve blockchaining. Or rather sharding. I am learning more towards blocks and transactions expiring. So for instance, after x amount if time, if your coins havent moved, they get rejected, because its in a block that is too old. This way nodes only have to keep up with blocks are N years old. Rather than every block, from every time, because there might be 0.2 BTC somewhere deep in there that someone wants to spend.
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:54:00
Also, two blocks in 2009/2010 is 100 BTC. Back then. I dont even. I mean how many of those coins that was mined in 2010 is sitting in wallet.dat that is defunct.

THe right answer is by scaling bitcoin. Thats how we get bitcoin to the 3rd world. Things might seem sour if you are to believe the hive mind, but if you try and transact bitcoin, the fees are not bad. If you set out on a mission to keep fees low you will ultimately sacrifice what really makes bitcoin what is it. What got it this far. So stop trying to adjust the protocol to control fees. You will just end up ruining it. Do you know what i mean? Road to hell is paved with good intentions. Now i dont want to discuss this any further. Have a nice day.

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:26:51
This is not correct, since optimisations can be made to allow for more effecient use of the blockspace, ie. more transactions per mb, for example Schnorr sigs. They are also working on solutions such as payment channels. Where you open a channel and then go back and forth afaik, as many times as you want, until you close again. That opens bitcoin to more usage, even with 1mb blocksize limit. Finally there entire off-chain systems can be built, that only relies on bitcoin to be sound, so that they can use it as a unit of account.

The correct analogy in that case is comparing free blockspace to free coffee. How sustainable is that? The reason we dont have a shortage on coffee is because it is susceptible to supply and demand - and a relative free market - if, on the other hand coffee was subsidized and made free, lets say the first 4 tonnes of coffee produced was free, it would be hoarded until there was nothing left. If blocksize limit is increased to 4mb, it will be hoarded until nothing is left. It doesent solve much. The level of thinking needed to solve this is on a much higher level than Ver is currently contributing.

Cool, but even a 20mb block size limit is not going to avoid a scenario with 40k unconfirmed tx. Imagine if we had 20mb blocks, and it would be another 5 years until full blocks. The vastly larger bitcoin economy would basically be thrown into a depression, because it has relied and built upon the notion that blocks werent full.
Basically full blocks is a pill we have to swallow sooner or later. Why postpone it?

Lol, it wont work that way. 
* Miners: Blocks are full, lets increase them. Whos with us?
* Developers: Its not safe.
* Exchanges: We are indifferent
Miners will just start making larger blocks anyway because why not include a few more transactions, you know for those extra fees? Some miners only find a single block per day. Why not stuff a huge chunk of mempool inside it for 0.5btc extra?
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:52:09
No, this is why SegWit is misunderstood and 2mb blocks is the knee-jerk solution. You are thinking like the people who thought the earth was flat because they couldnt see it was round.
In reality SegWit changes things under the hood so that SegWit type transactions carry a lower validation and UTXO cost than the legacy transactions. So the equivalent of increasing the blocksize to 2mb vs SegWits 2mb-4mb. Is literately putting 1 car on top of another. Where'as SegWit completes the design and gives us something more functional and effecient in the long run.
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:32:38
So. How legit is? An expert on chinese legal system can chime in? We've seen in the past someone making a draft for something, and in the end, its nothing but an unconfirmed transaction. Anyone can make those, and loads of them. You know what i mean? Have a nice day.

what 2x is doing is not reasonable. 
1. Its a bailout, bitcoin was invented in a desponse against them
2. It removes fee pressure, fee pressure is supposed to pay for security
3. fee pressure creates an incentive for frugal use, which means bitcoin can last years (on-chain tx are permantly kept, it doesent scale off-chain systems are much more urgently needed than on-chain capacity)
so not only are they making bitcoin weaker in terms of security, they are also demolishing its anti-bailout foundation that arguably has gotten it to where it is today, and would take it to $10k+, they also encourage increased use of on-chain transactions which increases centralization pressure.
These silly CEO's think they can make a shit and call it bitcoin and people will still pay $4,000 for it.

Easier said than done. And if im not mistaken you use of "we" means anyone else but you. Bitcoin Core have proposed a softfork that is yet to be activated that increases on-chain capacity by ~100% and enables technologies such as Lightning Networks that will enable additional use cases, thousands of transactions per second, instant and so on. Just saying.
@_date: 2017-01-29 13:10:55
i dont know. but please keep in mind the BU signalling is rather useless. Miners cant activate it unless they want to fork to their own chain, which i doubt they will. I have no idea why they are even signalling for it. But let the children be children right?
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:17:59

@_date: 2017-01-25 09:10:47
The hardfork is a significant undertaking, and what will you hardfork to? it makes little sense to attempt a hardfork to something that isnt sound. And no sound hardfork exists afaik. There are problems with each proposal that have been made. My suggestion is to ask paypal to adopt bitcoin because in the end thats better for buying steam games and what compared to spending an on-chain tx.  On top of that, support SegWit since it increases onchain capacity ~100% and enables scaling technologies such as Lightning Networks, which could potentially compete with paypal and VISA.

is the argument that core does not do what the chinese miners want, so the chinese miners will run bitcoin into the ground, therefore core is runnung bitcoin into the ground?
what do you think would happen if core said allright the chinese miners have demanded a hardfork so thats what we are doing. it would be contentious as fuck and the chinese miners dont realise it. the worst thing is that core will take the blame. thats why it pisses me off when people make demands at them. get someone else to do it.

SegWit reinforces LN which is a disruptive technology for miners. Miners are not interested in bitcoin script and use cases. They just want bitcoin to be a simple kind of money. They dont want to do "work" ala. script for anyone. They dont believe in that. They just want bitcoin to be as simple as possible, and that fees goes to them 100%. LN will allow people to do multiple transactions for the price of two fees. And miners are concerned, at least thats what they say, that bitcoins security will be compromised with LN because it will take all the fees - But i dont think there is any reason to believe that will be the case since LN still needs on-chain transactions and LN seem to be best suited for smaller payments.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:55:41


In that case you are not paying attention. Bitcoin price broke out at $788 which caused sellers to pull back all the way to ~$1100. But there was no demand up there so everyone started selling. However buyers were found at $840 which is still above the breakout point. So yes. Bitcoin does have market makers that keep everything from collapse.

Comparing softforks to hardforks is apples to oranges? A softfork miner signalling is enough. But with hardforks you need all miners and all nodes to be ready. And thats simplifying things.
*edit* I heard its possible to use bitcoin core but flag bitcoin unlimited. And i suspect thats what the miners are doing - well except bitcoin.com but they also make invalid blocks because they use BU. So in a sense you can fake mining power if you use Bitcoin Core but flag for BU.

How does that constitute a no? Im also pretty sure nothing gets sent outside the block. Its all within the block, including the witness data. Which is why you are going to see blocks larger than 1mb.
Also updated nodes will not cap based on 1 megabyte but based on weight. And the weight allowance is 4,000,000 million i believe (no more blocksize debate! yay. Its going to be block weight limit haha.). It is expected based on current mix of transactions that when the 4,000,000 weight per block will be consumed, the blocks will be about 2.1mb.

@_date: 2017-01-20 12:15:32


Nobody has that right. Nobody can dictate bitcoin, remember? Its a decentralized system.
Someone has fooled you into believing Core is in control. Which is absurd. They only deliver software that hooks up to bitcoin. If people want to use it thats fine. And if they dont, thats fine. Who cares. But if you have the impression they control bitcoin you are dead wrong. Case in point SegWit activation. They can only put it out there, its up to the network to adopt it.


This is why SegWit is genius. Its a compromise and delivers several things that different people have asked for. Mallebaility fix, blocksize increase, and plenty of under the hood optimisations and improvements. And to top it all of its a Softfork. We could have had it already if miners would activate it already.

@_date: 2016-06-16 19:56:04
Afaik miners are no longer nodes due to SPV mining. As far as i understand this is one of the reasons for the blocksize limit. In protocol node incentivisation is at an all time low, even tho lots of nodes are needed for a healthy network. 1mb blocksize limit arguably prevents bandwith costs from getting out of hand, which would otherwise result in more nodes leaving the network. Did you know there are only 116 nodes in China according to bitcoinnodes.com? Kind of, depressing. In other news, bitcoin is shotting for $800 it seems, and protocol upgrades seem too be piling up :)
@_date: 2016-06-29 06:06:12
Maybe i am crazy. But in my opinion bitcoin is above the law. What do i mean by that? Ask yourself why should BIP75 be incorporated. Because it is the law. Well ok. Whats next? What else does the law say? Bitcoin is above the law :) Maybe that is a path to disaster, but maybe it is the path to success.
Also, there is no free market when it comes to BIP75 because KYC/AML is enforced, so there is no choice. You know what i mean? If there was a free market, ie. no state intervention, BIP75 would likely not even be a thing :)
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:44:54
It doesent fix anything. It strips nodes from a blocksize limit and lets miners dictate it instead. This introduces a variety of concerns that are more critical than the problem they attempt to solve.

I was trying to find the story but i couldnt. It sucks. But the hack was very clever. It was an exploit in google docs or google spreadsheets that allowed the attacker to gain access to the victims gmail account who opened it. Then he used that gmail account to send an email to a specific employee of the company requesting x amount of BTC to this adresss, and the BTC was just sent without further questions. Im a little fuzzy on the details but i believe the google account that was hacked even had 2FA on. Which is fucked up. But dont quote me on that. Have a nice day.

Bigger blocks only make a tiny difference in the grand scheme of things. For example when the mempool jumped to 250,000 tx pending, how big of a diffference do you 4mb blocks would have made?
Preferably we get payment rails that can not be backlogged at all. I personally dont understand the fascination of on-chain transactions by average people. Is that really what people want to use for everyday shopping etc.? I think we can do better........

What are SegWits problems? The gains are certainly tremendous


Nothing significant tho. Was it? People moved on and the switch was worth it i presume. What was the damage?
That being said, SegWit is probably the most reviewed patch than anything. And the developers behind it have a crapload of more experience than ever. What are you afraid of?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:33:47
You have a limited understanding of SegWit, its as if the only thing you know about it is that it segregates the witness data. Come back when you have read and understood the purpose of doing it. Here is a good place to start

But its not like the information is hidden. And wether you like it or not it makes bitcoin look worse simply because it chose to have permanent inflation. Doesent matter if its 1% or 0.1%. Or if total coin supply wont double the first 60 years. You have a weaker product on your hand regardless, if we can call it that. I would like to discuss this further but im out of time.

Have you thought this through? If you want to "cut" costs of on chain transactions by making bigger and bigger blocks, bitcoin wont be viable in countries with subpar IT infrastructure in the end. Keep costs associated with owning and running a node low, develop transaction systems that are cheap and effecient that hook up to your node so to speak instead. Capiche?

This is a myth. First of all the developers do it on their own time, admittedly some have sponsors and blockstream is a big sponsor when it comes to bitcoin core development. Thanks! 
But my point is that bitcoin development is still time consuming and its cutting edge. And there several aspects of scaling bitcoin. It simply unfair to say that devs have abandoned mainnet scaling just because you are not seeing any progress. But how hard are you looking? SegWit has been available for mainnet since last year. And it really emphasizes on scaling as well as ending malleability. It also has script versioning which makes future improvements in the scaling department possible - see Schnorr Signatures. 
Basically getting a bit tired of the notion that devs have abandoned mainnet scaling when the evidence points to the contrary.

The thing is if they dont forbid the bitcoin ETF before march, well then it goes to auto approval, afaik. So maybe that was their plan all along.
And on the flip side, if they decide to deny it this late in the game. That would be most scumbag move ever. Im presuming that the winklewoss in particular have spent alot of money, and done alot of work trying to get this approved. If the SEC just postpones, and postpones, and postpones, and then deny it at the last second. Thats such a scumbag move.

Miners dont signal intent, they signal readyness. 18% are ready for BU (But it wont happen any time sime soon.) 25% are signalling readyness for SegWit (All it takes is for the remaining miners to be ready, then it activates.

Why are you comparing deflationary money with stock market trading? What is the connection?
Any by the way, there is more logic to the argument that if people get more money, they spend more money, than if they get more money, they stop spending. There is more logic to people spending money, when they get more of it, rather than they stop spending since spending money is essential for survival for adults, you dont need an additional incentive like devaluing it for them to do it. So you spend the same, just to get by, by you will have more for recretaional and that kind of stuff, if your money is increasing in value over time. You get a surpluss. You get more money to spend on stuff. Its better than eliminating purchasing power. Its 100% logical. If you eliminate peoples purchasing power over time, they get less purchasing power, and thus less to spend.

You just conspiracied yourself tho. But i dont blame ya. Try to be better than the BU crowd.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:09:19
I will try.
There are basically two parts of the software. Theres the consensus rules which has to be identical on all clients, thats the point of the whole system. Thats why no single client can change the ledger or give himself more coins etc. Every other client will detect it and ban him immidately. 
Then theres the "client" side, which determines how you index the blockchain and how your wallet works and all that stuff. For the most part "client" side stuff does not require forks, but the consensus stuff described above will require a fork which means everyone has to update and be ready at the same time(Unless its a softfork, as the name also gives out. Those are softer, but its still an update to the consensus rules and they will ban someone who offends them). I hope that helps.

Queue the butterfly effect. BU just removes a little friction. Fast forward a few years and you have a mining cartel that resembles OPEC that decides how big blocks will be.

Now if you wanted to implement permanent inflation for neglicible security (if that is the case) its not worth it.

S2X has a corporate governance structure. It is inherently centralized and top/down. Note it only has one dev, and he is only coding what the agreement says. Everything else is rejected.
So nothing is free, and cheaper fees come with a price. You are better off using an altcoin rather than disrupting the bitcoin network with a contentious fork. Altcoins will also suffer if bitcoin suffer.
Can you explain why you simply dont use an altcoin? There are hundreds, and even Bitcoin Cash which is very similar to BTC but has 8mb blocks. If you really believed in big blocks, just use that and be happy.

At the moment the max blocksize is secured by the network as a whole. Not just miners. So not sure what you are on about. BU will give the max blocksize to miners essentially since nodes would have to follow or fork themselves off if larger blocks come their way, its a huge change in gametheory and how bitcoin has worked so far (without incident. for 8 years? holy shit). So we cannot allow bitcoin security to rely on miner charitabilty. That is not trustless. Like we can say today that the max blocksize is 1mb. It prevents things from getting out of control. It makes bitcoin trustless, which gives it value. However lately im starting to doubt the trustlessness in bitcoin because mining seem highly centralized. But thats a different discussion.

Ill be honest i did not bother to read the article. The starbucks comparison was a turn off. But my point still stands i think. And the question is wether you want to subsidise blockspace or not. A guy like Ver who consider himself well versed in economics, as far as i know, should be able to see the tragedy of the commons, when blocks are non-full. It becomes a race to fill them up again. And the scale achived by raising the blocksize limit is next to nothing. So nothing is really gained.
And most importantly, full blocks are essential for the bitcoin ecosystem. Blockchain use becomes frugal, alternative means to transact are pursued. This is good, because an on-chain bitcoin tx is a finite resource. We can make it seem infinite like a good socialist promising wellfare or housing to everyone, but its going to cause problems down the road. Keeping the 1mb blocksize limit for now is genious :) Its a cry for help. The system we have now keeps the token secure, and its bloody good at it. We need solutions for transacting bitcoin . Lets see if anyone will take the bait. (Im looking at you paypal.)
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:18:22


What the hell are you smoking? SegWit does not mean 1mb limit forever. In fact it enables blocks that are twice as big as today, so its the fastest route to larger blocks. Alot of people have also endorsed segwit, so i dont know why you say nobody wants it.

Here is what i dont understand re the SegWit trolls. They claim that SegWit is a no-go because it has "technical debt". However technical debt can be dealt with in the future if need be.
But when it comes to UTXO "bloat". You dont really have a choice. Once its there you cant get rid of it. 
So if you think segwit is bad because it adresses UTXO bloat, but incurs "technical debt" in the codebase your priorities are wrong imo.

Im not sure what you mean by direct motivation? In any case it doesent mean there is no motivation. 


To my knowledge none of the miners are maintaining any of the software that interacts with the network. Well, they have a few wallets and block explorerers, case in point btc.com - but this is not critical infrastructure. Miners are more like parasites/bacteria and as such they can become harmful.
So who leads the protocol? I would argue developers working on client implementations. They maintain the critical software, they understand the tradeoffs etc.

Then people with that opinon will give you money and attention. It doesent matter if you believe in it yourself what matters is that you act like you believe in it. In the end there is little incentive for you to change peoples opinion. The incentive is to milk it. And here we are. Bitcoin Unlimited with 20% hashrate and about 450 nodes. And a $500k donation as well as a $1.2M development grant. It is amazing how far you can get with bullshit. Not sure if that answered the question or not.

Its just a softfork that will fix some things and increase the amount of transactions possible per day with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:24:24
I like how they narrow it down like that. In reality the PoW is also securing the integrity of the system. Its what gives the coins the possibility to hold value to begin with. As most of you know the market cap of bitcoin is on the billions. And this is only possible in large part due to PoW. It will be interesting to see what happens to ETH market cap if/when they switch to PoS.

I said this months ago. And people thought i was crazy. But i still believe we are headed for the mid-4 digits.
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:16:49
What is the appeal of putting bitcoin nodes into datacenters? At that point we would be relying on 3rd parties for even on-chain transactions?
Keep in mind what gives bitcoin strength is its guerilla like warfare. The system is distributed in homes across the world which makes it nigh impossible to shut down. There is the exception of mining which have become highly commercialsed, but i expect mining to re-enter homes if/when mining hardware starts facing the consumers. I dont see why that wouldnt be the case with for example Intel getting their eyes open to this thing. Most technologies start out not being available to consumers/middle class, but as they evolve and are refined they end up in the on those hands and that becomes the biggest market for the technology in question.

and segwit carries several benefits. an effective blocksize increase is just one of many things it provides.
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:17:32
For me Ethereum doesent make sense, but there are swathes of people who seem to think it does without explaining why, only using talking points. And vitalik isnt going to tell the truth. He will pump it until he has ruined his reputation (but made alot of money). This is why people dont like Vitalik. He is a con artist. Right? It doesent matter if he likes bitcoin. He is still a con artist.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:42:10
It has the potential to be that. But it requires upgrades to the protocol. It seems that miners have to enable the upgrades, but they are reluctant for some reason. Maybe they are just lazy. In any case that is likely to bring down bitcoin. So hopefully more miners will get off their ass and signal for stuff like SegWit so we can move on.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:05:41
SegWit IS a blocksize increase
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:32:55
It could be better, is what im getting at. And when there was a proposal to make an updated version, people went batshit crazy. The reaction was 100% irrational and as a consequence new people comming to bitcoin and wanting to get up to speed suffer.

I would like to add that when it was first massively mined by "bitcoin" miners the blocks per hour was between 40-50. This round the blocks per hour is 30. It will be interesting to see where the next EDA takes the blocks per hour.

A ridicolous update would never be linked to or quoted or used as any kind of resource. This is fundamentally how the internet works tbh. The quality floats to the top and the crap stays at the bottom usually. So even if you had someone write a ridicoulous updated paper with false information, who would use it? Who would link to it? Whats the concern?

The spam only lasts a day iirc. And it happened twice, but i dont think both times were in december. Even if we assume they were. Two days worth of spam is very far from 80% of the blocks for a whole month. You know i mean?
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:47:30


Satoshi did before he left. But bitcoin is more secure in that it has a fixed hardlimit. That can be eased, in this time with a softfork to a new hard limit. Well the new  limit is based on *weight* rather than bytes. Which is more flexible, and weighing transactions in terms of their footprint in terms of UTXO etc. is more appropriate. Well, its more scalable. Think of it is less pollutant, for lack of a better term. Kinda going off on a tangent here. Sorry about that. Have a nice day..
@_date: 2016-06-04 11:22:51

bitcoin should be able to run on anything almost. so if you want a silent setup? spend money on soundproof material and low noise cooling etc. I mean even a low end CPU should be good for a long time. Only problem is the initial sync which may take a while. But not sure thats a problem in your case. There can be instances where a reindex will be neccesary. If Bitcore does a new release where that is neccesary. Then if you are absolutely dependen on getting your node back up ASAP, you may want to get some good fucking hardware so you can do it fast.
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:18:20

How do you know? The hashing power dont determine the validity of the fork. Case in point Ethereum. Who is inconvenienced at least from a monetary/speculative angle from Ethereum Classic. The miners ultimately decided the hardfork was a good idea. But it fucking came back to bite them.

But they havent learned anything. Hardforks are not prudent. They are still trying to hardfork. How dumb can these people be?

Do you think bitcoin is still undervalued if it never forked from here on (Which could be a reality). Ie. blocksize limit never change, and there will not be additional use cases like lightning network or covenants added either.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:14:55
Does that make sense to you? If you ask most people theyd say we need a blocksize increase asap. In which case SegWit is it. If you want to wait for a hardfork then you are not really that interested in a blocksize increase since a hardfork seems years away.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:51:15
That would be profound.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:29:56
I "vote" for status quo if not SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:52:37
Sure leave the original one intact. But that doesent mean that updating it is a bad idea. You can have both. But its silly to talk about tbh. Lets move on.

No. I dont know when the first full block was. I was going by what goxedbux said. Besides it doesent matter in this particular case. The daily no. of tx continued to grow until all blocks are full, and thats what im talking about. I  think it will be hard to beat this record without for example SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:23:39


It depends on their rationale. An irrational opposition does not mean SegWit is controversial. So the question is wether the opposition is irrational or not. I have certainly seen many irrational and ignorant statements against SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:14:31
Looks like the miners would rather run bitcoin to the ground if it doesent do what they want
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:28:19
btc as is is still more interesting than litecoin with segwit because of the network effect. But that doesent mean people wont switch.
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:08:18
that small uptick coincided with bitcoin reaching $1,000 and hitting the news. Its likely a wave of new people trying out bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:10:01
I think you get small fees if people pass through your node. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:46:24
Theres a group of people who have defined scaling as increasing the blocksize limit via a hardfork. BU have positioned themselves to cash in on that notion. Unfortunately it means bitcoin will get no scaling because in order for bitcoin to scale everyone must agree on a proposal. As long as there are 15 different ones (Im exaggerating) bitcoin cant move forward unless a split which would be redicolous tbh.
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:06:37


The bitcoin network goes by a specific code :P if you dont adhere to it you cannot participate. At least thats my understanding. So if a miner makes a block that does not fit within the rules of what a block should like - as enforced by the rest of the network - that block will be orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:30:10
I hear you. Bitcoin is actually in a recession right now, but its poorly reflected in the price. More buisnesses are going to get out of buisness as the fee pressure increases. But thats because well, blockspace was artificially abundant in the first decade of bitcoin which made buisnsess and end users adopt the wrong habits. We are going to transition over the next few years into an economy that takes into account relatively high fees for on-chain transfers and we are going to see, i hope, transaction systems built on top of bitcoin for buisneses and end users to use day to day.

If you think 1mb blocksize limit is better than &gt;2mb i can understand. But people who want increased on-chain capacity should probably support SegWit right now. And alot of people are.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:39:47


If that is the case miners should pay for that. They should pay to have someone develop that kind of fork and pay to have it marketed so it can get consensus. Do they expect to just be able to sit around and have people provide them what they want for free? That is pathetic to be honest
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:14:42
Well, its pretty close. And with SegWit i think it is. Happy to be corrected.

Basically BTCC has to self-regulate. Np.


Basically "bitcoin is not legal tender and should not be used at such. But you are free to carry on."
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:35:54
It probably wont be that easy and it gets harder over time as the codebases in theory diverge. For example Bitcoin ABC has changed a fundamental structure of their codebase afaik, so they made it harder for themselves to benefit from the work and improvements from the bitcoin core software project.
The irony is, if Bitcoin Cash becomes popular, significant... basically interesting. Then competent dev teams will move to it, and the same culture of conservatism will develop that exist in bitcoin right now. This is the hilarious thing about Bitcoin Cash. They dont understand that if it becomes interesting, competent people will take charge of development because those peoples software is what people want to run. And the same issues are going to be raised that is raised in Bitcoin right now. 
1. On-chain transactions dont scale
2. Off-chain tech is needed
But Bitcoin Cash rather stick their hand in the sand and go full yolo on big blocks without even optimising for it first. Sad.

it was the miners own idea to make that agreement afaik. and perhaps their intentions were good. they want bitcoin to scale. but bitcoin isnt designed in a way that makes it change when a few men sign a piece of paper. and to be honest i dont think they expected it to. i dont get what the problem is.

How long until paypal adopts Bitcoin? They support Dollar, Euro, British Pounds etc.
Just gonna be a matter of time until they adopt bitcoin i think. And that will be what the big blockers really want. Cheap, fast payments for buying coffee.
And let me tell you, a bitcoin paypal transaction will be much cheaper than a USD done because paypal will have nearly 0 banking overhead when using bitcoin because the blockchain is the bank. Its quite amazing.

@_date: 2017-01-25 19:27:58
So my understanding and perhaps im wrong is that no further capacity increases are comming to bitcoin. No SegWit, no hardforks, no nothing. It will be status quo from now on. This only leaves room for off-chain services if transacting in bitcoin is going to expand.
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:03:05
So people have figured out how to transact and use bitcoin without running a node. But that only works because other people are still running a node. So why run a node? To carry your own weight. And possibly serve the blockchain or parts of it to others who want to join the network as well. I mean bitcoin is peer to peer in the end, so to me it doesent make sense to use it unless you hook directly up to the chain with a node.. you also get better privacy that way.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:40:27
It is not a simple issue to fix(ask ETH, soon as they raise blocksize, few months pass and "congestion" is back), but segwit is a step in the right direction.

@_date: 2017-01-25 09:27:48
Orphan  risk is reduced by centralizing into larger pools, harddisk space and bandwidth use is not a big concern for commercial miners. over time theyd make the blocks so big that people have to rely on 3rd parties for on-chain transactions. in which case bitcoin would be a retarded form of paypal.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:45:08
Why does hashrate come first? When we look at how bitcoin has evolved, hashrate comes last. 
First users come. They buy the coin, they create demand, then exchanges and services form, then more miners join because the coin is in more demand and thus has a higher exchange rate and thus is more profitable to mine. Right?
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:06:36
Why does that matter?
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:14:19
How many people used their service? I mean how much volume did they have in regards to buying and selling, anyone know?
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:13:21
Why would you expect that? Bitcoin is such a diverse ecossystem and its very specialised. A dev will not have time to mine and he will not be able to do as good a job as a dedicated miner because of that, and a miner will not have time to dev etc. Thats just how i see it.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:52:41
Using on-chain tx in your daily life seems like a bad idea. It only worked when nobody else was doing it. I think bitcoin will find its place as a store of value and medium of exchange. Not so much as a payment system ಠ_ಠ

@_date: 2017-08-08 01:22:15
Okay thats interesting. Im not a fan of BCH either.
I think the difference between you and i is i can see how bitcoin will continue to be used even with high fees, where as you probably worry it wont. Am i right?
That being said, you may be right. Time will tell. 
But whats best for the network is that blocksize limit stays relatively low, and there is a consistent backlog.
Because 
1. It ensures fee pressure for miners 
2. It prevents spam and encourages frugal use, remember that all transactions are kept forever and has to be validated by every node. Thats what makes the system trustless.
Anyway-........... i think i will just get my popcorn ready. My biggest concern right now is the SegWit2x hardfork. I think its completely unneccesary and going to be very disruptive. But time will tell. Have a nice day.

Things tend to move slow in bitcoin because the incentives are not immidately clear when it comes to forks (they tend to get low priority). Generally no news is good news. But i was poking around on one of the pools that do not signal segwit, i was poking around on their github and it looks like they are working on implementing it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 05:28:46
segwits implemention does not shock the fee market as its adoption, once activated will be gradual. however, he who choses to use segwit benefits from the instant he does. but not everyone will use sw from day 1.

Thank you. But saying PBOC FUD is misleading imo.
As i gathered the PBOC was responsible and this was the message: regulate yourself, bitcoin is not legal tender, but carry on. 
It was the people who sold the PBOC news as china banning bitcoin that were fudding.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:27:27
Its not black and white no, but it is to Bitcoin Unlimited. They only want to do it their way. For example they want to hardfork SegWit when its already ready to be softforked. They are dumb dumbs.
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:20:40
Thank you to the core devs for not taking any risks with the bitcoin network. is the biggest reason we are still here .. now we are about to break out again because bitcoin devs in particular have been very responsible with the system. Now if only  those pesky miners would start signalling for segwit so we could move on.
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:57:27
When would you consider a node being prohibitive? I think we are nearing that point with nodes consuming 600gb bandwidth per month. But you tell me.

Since it has been proposed in the first place there must already be widespread consensus right? Should developers propose a change for signalling if there isnt already widespread community agreement? IDK

I agree with you. There does not seem to be an easy solution tho. If anything SegWit can sort some of it out with the capacity bump. If not Lighting Network, which i think is very promising. But those are still just small steps in the grand scheme of things i think.

First thing they did when they got some money was go to r/btc and ask what to do with it. When bitcoin unlimited are supposed to be the experts. But it seems like nobody knows what to do with the money but they were eager to spend it anyways, so they decided a new website would be a good idea.
This is basically what is happening. [weekend at bernies](
@_date: 2016-11-17 08:30:17
I think there is a misunderstanding here. Not allowing posts that tries to sell clients with consensus changes, is not the same as not allowing discussion of consensus changes. Imo the difference is that when you can only discuss the idea, it has to be good and hold up against scrutiny. But when you can peddle the software you can make it seem as if there is more support and the idea is better than it is by rigging the narrative. For example, why did BU not make a bip? is their only chance with a game of politics? i think so
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:15:45
How does the market decide? Please walk me through the process.
@_date: 2016-11-23 10:08:25
SegWit can hardly be considered experimentation compared to BU which potentially changes fundamental incentive structures. There is 0 reason to be meddling with those. If it isnt broke dont fix it. The good news about BU is that its a flexible cap. The bad news is that it will potentially get out of control.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:20:32
Maybe its not only the devaluation. But in countries that devalue their currency i imagine that capital controls are common as well. And those sort of limits. So bitcoin presents an entire new world of no restrictions because everyone can be their own bank :p

This is an old argument that bitcoin has already proven wrong. Price is up, daily no. of tx is up, last but not least average fee is up. When you add it all together you realise that on-chain fees are not what keeps people from holding bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:14:29
This will probably be the last on-chain bitcoin black friday. Next year it will be LN or maybe some other kind of ordeal :) The reason being that fees are going to end on-chain retail payments. As much as i hate it i recognize thats just how it is. Have a nice day.

Investors are not interested in a blocksize limit increase. They dont hold for that. Everyone knows that if bitcoin is to become widely adopted it has to take place on second layers. The people who are clamoring for a blocksize limit increase are either insecure or playing a game. Which one are you?
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:56:30
The obvious workaround since its a big problem in their sub and since they all say its not censored, is to make a whitelist that people can apply for. But i guess they are not that serious about free and unrestricted speech in the end. Not enough to maintain a whitelist for the benefit of dissenting opinions at least.

If you are being censored just deal with it. What you are doing there is not helping. Its basically kicking and screaming and its not helping you. Just calm down and say what you want to say in a respectful and kind manner and everything will be ok, i guarantee it. (Of course it shouldnt break the rules).

Since there are so many users in bitcoin its hard to conclude wether or no the development community has the users interest at heart. I think the people who work on the protocol at least (the development community is also poorly defined. Are the mycelium devs part of the development community? they made a decent wallet for example) anyway, the people who work on the protocol may not have the users interest at heart? I dont know. But they do have Bitcoins interest at heart. And i think its for the better. But always people are free to step up and contribute if they feel something is missing or could be better. But the problem is then theyd have to work together with others and defend their positions and fight for their ideas and arent necceserily getting paid so what is the point? 
*edit* just realised i misread your post. But im going to live my response up anyway because i think it raises an interesting point. Have a nice day.

Not sure, sorry. Maybe someone else can explain.
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:48:00
Its just not safe. Lets say SegWit activates with 51%. Yay we can use SegWit now. But thats just not a safe enough guarantee that the SegWit functionality will not be rolled back. Thats how i see it. In any case, even if SegWit activates with 95% we still have to take it easy to begin with as far as i understand. First it has to activate, then it has to ossify. Im not sure how future softforks are going to affect the SegWit format. Im counting on there not being issues.
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:22:58
Im sorry to hear that. But that is just how bitcoin works. When there is a lot of demand the price for a fast tx increases. I wish it were otherwise but i guess no :p Have a nice day. And i hope everything gets sorted.

can we find a better word? tx is a long word and technically when they use bitcoin its more like a wire than a tx for most people 
@_date: 2016-11-26 08:12:26
The only option is SegWit, as of yet there exist no other competent proposal to increase blocksize limit. People will have you believe that hardforking to a 2mb blocksize limit is much simpler and doesent require a competent proposal. It could have been done ages ago. But they are wrong.
Also if you are really interested in bitcoin i suggest you do your own diligence. Asking on reddit is not the best way, and you are relying on others to voluntarily educate you. Of course people with real knowledge and skill do not have time to educate people on reddit, and as a result the only thing you will find here is slander and vitriol for the most part. Have a nice day.

Why is this so hard to understand for you? It seems so simple to me.
When you push a client around that changes consensus rules without first having gone through thorough peer review and an actual discussion of the proposed changes, you are being anti-consensus. How can you not understand it?
My bitcoin node is not compatible with BU because there have been no discussion there has been no collaboration they just skipped it. Its an alt-coin. And they are hoping to tip the scale by getting enough hashpower on board, but how are they going to do that? And then what is everyone supposed to do if they succeed? Just switch? BU is wrong on several levels
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:51:30
Maybe i am being too naive, but why would they reject it for political reasons? It seems that miners are too busy mining that they dont care about signalling for upgrades. If a coin stops being profitable for whatever reason they just switch to another. What do they have to lose?

@_date: 2016-11-26 12:11:00
very good for bitcoin. It means it has a place where it wont be demonized.

scaling doesent really matter. Bitcoin is Bitcoin :) Someone, somewhere will have a use for on-chain tx even if they are $5 dollars each i bet. Besides, the scaling or lack thereof doesent affect the integrity of the tokens. They will at least retain their value if not casually keep increasing regardless of what kind of on-chain scaling is achived. Thats just my opinion.

Roger is a snake. Of course he will try to look his best on a podcast. But when no-one is looking he is busy plotting how to get control over the protocol. I think Roger is one of those guys that cant get enough. Those guys that want what they cant have. If he can control bitcoin he is going to think he is the most powerfull man in the world. Also please take what i say with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:46:58
Not sure i believe you? When i go there it seems fairly neutral. SegWit also first started signalling today, so if there was anything previously it should be removed?

@_date: 2016-12-08 16:36:07
Hm. There are 250k tx per day. The only way fees can go down is if there stops being 250k tx per day or the blocksize limit is increased, or someone finds out how to make tx smaller. So im not concerned that high fees will stop bitcoin working as money and being passed around. Because, the high fees are only there because alot of people are passing bitcoin around.

Anyway in reality thats not that big of a change all things considered. First of all, it only affects SegWit tx. It doesent change the tx we currently use. I think thats very agnostic, i dont know about you.

That is not my experience at all. I can best describe the rules as an attempt to filter out noise. There is a difference between discussing a blocksize limit increase and implifications there of. How to do it and so on. There is a difference between that and spamming a client that just does it. One is allowed here the other is not. Maybe some of the legitimate discussion is lost because of this, but no forum is perfect afterall. And r/bitcoin can only control what goes on on r/bitcoin. People have a wide variety of avenues and alternatives to discuss what they want how they want. r/bitcoin simply has a specific set of rules and people have to respect them or go else where. Its not that complicated.
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:09:43


Let me stop you right there. Because discussion of changes to the protocol is not banned. I think its encouraged tbh. But when you start spreading software (that changes the protocol) and asking everyone to run it that crosses the line. I mean if bitcoin is to succeed we would have to be able to come to consensus without throwing it out like that? Whats wrong the bip process? I mean i think a process for protocol upgrades is relevant. Not this partisan BU vs Core thing, the one who the most hashing power sides with wins. Its not prudent. But maybe i am wrong.
Basically if i started a bitcoin client that changed the limit from 21m coins to 40 million coins for example, most people would be able to see that is a bad idea. And if i kept spamming the client, and vote manipulated and all those sorts of things you can do on reddit, then eventually people will be tired of it, and it will just be removed. However, people do not understand as clearly that Bitcoin Unlimited is a bad idea. So thats where the misunderstanding arise from. And it all boils down to the notion that bitcoin is self-organised. You have to educate yourself. And some people just wont or cant and will rather cling to their own bias with all their energy.

From the SPV users perspective, a hardfork may not look like an alt-coin. But from the node operators perspective a hard fork basically is. If he doesent update he stays on the old chain, if he does update, he stays on the new chain. There can be a situation where you have a perfect hardfork, where the old chain dies and the new one becomes the default one. But how do you do a perfect hardfork in bitcoin?
I think the problem is that people are touchy. So rather than try to understand why some might consider hardforks an alt-coin they throw a fit. They do not want to understand the implifiications of a hard fork. They just want it, and they want it now. Of course bitcoin resists these people by default. But on social media its an on-going battle. If everyone was reasonable and calm, we could have alot more fun together, than.. the current state of affairs. But i think bitcoin will always be toxic and full of drama. Doesent really matter. End of the day there wont be a contentious hard fork in bitcoin.

Well that depends on what you think bitcoin is. If you think its one big cold storage system for your savings, then it doesent require much TPS per person or family. 250k deposits and withdrawals per day (This is the current capability. Almost double with SegWit) is probably not enough to cover the whole worlds need for cold storage who knows, but it likely goes a long way.

Please keep in mind this is easy for roger since he has alot of money. You know what im saying? if for example he would muster the courage to support segwit, then we can talk. but i dont think he is able to show that kind of leadership. he is just spending his money as usual, its all he knows :|

The chance of miners taking over bitcoin is very small, its not in their interest. ViaBTC is just trying to stir up fud. I think their cloud mining is an exit scam since their hash rate has gone down over the past few months, and theyve been so vocal about not flagging for SegWit when all they have to do is not flag for it when the time comes. They are basically all in as far as i can see. it will be interesting to see if they stick around. Keep in mind they came out of nowhere in June, they have only existed for 5 months pretty much. They may disappear as suddenly as they appeared.

Roger Ver has convinced himself - by in particular sorrounding himself with r/btc shills - that the only way for bitcoin to suceed at this point is for him to take over and Core to vanish. He has lost his way from the blocksize debate and the blatant social engineering that took place during it. He fell victim to it because he wasnt strong enough and has become a villain.

It really depends on how you look at it. As far as i understand the part of a SegWit tx that has to be kept forever is significantly smaller. Obviously the benefits of this is that the blockchain will fit more tx per kb..

And the irony was, as far as i recall, that that setting was a default setting. People had to tell them to update it. Even now when SegWit is in the pipeline they are slow as hell to get ready. I just dont think its prudent having miners control the max blocksize. Its just a dream that it will prevent blocksize debates in the future but it wont. And its a double edged sword as well, since the miners can be lobbied to increase max blocksize beyond whats healthy long term, but benefecial to a few companies short term. Etc.

Most people dont understand what bitcoin is. Its a piece of software you run on your computer to stick it to the man, yea! If we cant run bitcoin on our computers what is the point?
I dont really care if people want to pay $20 for an on-chain tx.. But i do care if i can no longer afford to run the software at home. I think gun owners  would understand. You hope you never have to use it. But you still want to have one at home.

Its no more a power grab than say Google producing a new phone and then everyone buys it. But we dont really consider that power grabs.

No, not quite. As far as i understand Lightning is some sort of hybrid. You put money into the network and then you can do any kind of TPS you want. No limit. But it doesent depend on a centralized service like VISA and or Paypal. Its still decentralized. I hope that makes sense.

You cant even look up the no. of tx that are currently in each block?
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:06:09
It is unfair to call BU on-schain scaling. Its not honest. All it does is allow miners to raise blocksize. But chances are they wont choose anything larger than what SegWit permits. In reality under BU the blocksize will be dertemined by experts and miners will use the recommended blocksize. Also keep in mind the vanilla transactions are a less effecient transaction format because of their crudeness. 60% of the transaction size are signatures, which we dont care about except for when the tx takes place. Yet they are still stored in the blockchain and the UTXO set. So if you increase the vanilla blocksize limit to 2mb for example you get 2x faster growth of everything which increases the need for scaling even more.
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:41:58
The people who have been vocal about blocking SegWit have everything to lose if it activates. So they will do everything they can to try and stop it. However i dont think it can be stopped, but the question is when it will activate. Id say probably mid january.

I think its important to understand there are two sides to bitcoin. There are those who provide the resources that make it work and there are those who use those resources for their own good. And the logic is sound when you say if fees are low more people will use it. Its like saying if we increase taxes we have more money. But the problem is, there is another side to the equation and if the burden is increased on the people who provide the resources its likely there willl be less likely to provide any in the end.

I mean, this donation is alot of money. But its not alot of money to Roger Ver. So when you put it in perspective this isnt that big of a deal.

@_date: 2017-01-25 15:22:25
Im not sure what Roger Ver an bitcoin core agreeing on a segwit + 2mb hardfork would accomplish. niether of them are in charge of the network. niether of them can push a button and then the network does as they say. 
personally i think hardforking to a 2mb blocksize limit is overrated. because as mentioned hardforking bitcoin is a huge undertaking. its a big network and everyone has to update in advance, and you have to get everyone to agree, unless you want to split the network and i dont see the point of that. anyway. im still holding my coins. im just not using them to buy pizza etc. anymore. - i werent really doing that in the first place.

if people like the state because it gives them power, they will like bitcoin too. Chances are that statesmen will not fight bitcoin, but transition to it (the state is dying anyway, why should they be loyal to it?). Having the bitcoins means having the power in the future, and they are still very much on sale.
i mean the power of office wanes in comparison to the power of bitcoin, and that is why we slowly see even politicians etc. buying/defecting to it.

@_date: 2016-11-29 11:32:25
Essentially what happens in such a scenario is that bitcoin loses some hashing power, so the time between blocks increase until difficulty has adjusted. But what you are going to see, at least if the miners that remain flag for SegWit, is that a larger portion of the blocks mined will flag for SegWit. So in that type of scenario SegWit signalling increases.
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:21:25
You only need the top two pools then you have 51%, am i right? How is that the economic majority? Even if you needed several pools to get 51% hashing rate, thats still not the economic majority. Hashing rate is a very poor metric to define economic majority. Its just a miner majority, to which i ask, why is that important? Just fork now, the economic majority will follow, if you have a good enough product.

Its how i operate now. Most funds are in cold storage aka. hardware wallet and the rest is on bitcoin Core :) But i wanna be 100% bitcoin core. I think its just better. And it gives me a reason to keep the node up.

Once you go node you never come back. I used to have this idea that in order to run a node i would need a separate server and it would have to run 24/7. But its not neccesary. Just have bitcoin start when your computer starts and have it run in the background (But remember to port forward and check if its reachable on bitnodes website). But keep in mind it can use alot of bandwidth.

Block rewards are not going away any time soon tho. I suspect large miners are still going to be profitable with SegWit+block rewards for the next 8 years at least. I couldnt rule out a further blocksize limit increase before then tho. 2-4-8 is still in play i think. Point is Core cant guarantee anything. So im not sure what excactly miners want. Core also does not exist in an official capacity. There is no-one at the top. So if some members agree to a hardfork, chances are other members will block it. I mean Bitcoin is what it is. Its just how it is.

@_date: 2016-11-24 04:47:46
Sure. But you have to keep in mind that on-chain transactions are completely voluntary for most people. If they chose to use on-chain tx as their daily driver they also chose to pay whatever it costs. I think you will see more and more people turning to alternative tx systems that build on top of bitcoin, because the bottom layer wont cut it.
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:49:52
Yep. But it should never happen because the system by and large works as is and wont change much. Now imagine that BU gets their way, thats a pretty big change, and it could end up that even tho miners are acting in their best self interest. Ie. blocksize will be perpetually increased because *they* can afford it, then eventually they will price out nodes and other miners who cant.. And its a problem i think.

Even tho bitcoin is currently very crude i still prefer it over traditional payment systems. I cant see myself going back to those. Im not sure what a crypto currency needs to be succesful. It seems like bitcoin has nailed the security. Now it needs to scale. Unfortunately blockchains in their current forms are not very scalable. But bitcoin has been out for 8 years and every acedemic and cryptographer and you name it knows about it. Where is the next level cryptocurrency? All other ones currently in existence seem to face the excact same challenges like bitcoin, with slightly different nuances.
Anyway with the lightning network its possible that bitcoin will have found the scale it needs. And with the sidechains there is the possibility of enabling more advanced stuff. In short i dont see why bitcoin wouldnt be around in 5-10 years. I mean if crypto-currency would still be a thing in 5-10 years. I think bitcoin will still be the most widely used.

Anti consensus is when you advocate a client that includes changes to consensus rules that have not been properly tested or discussed. In bitcoin resources are scarce.. So these types of clients should be stayed away from. 
Other than that there seems to be an idea that consensus is whatever the most hashing power sides with. But thats not true. The hashing power do not represent bitcoin.

You are correct. But the reason tradeblock is not showing anything could be because they have configured their mempool differently. But when a mempool gets 60k unconfirmed tx out of nowhere. That is guaranteed to be spam most of it. But it doesent really matter since bitcoin handles spam pretty good.

Have you considered that you, yourself is not as smart as you think you are? And that is the cause of your frustration?
In reality LN will not be adopted from day one - shocker - and since people are creatures of habit they wont start using LN until fees are high enough. Do you understand what this means? LN will gain adoption faster the higher fees are which will create a sort of equilibrium as people spill over into LN. Miner income wont disappear. Besides, ViaBTC says fees are bad, so what do they care?
@_date: 2016-12-14 16:03:18
The blocksize debate touches so many things. Its not something your average redditor is qualified to discuss at least. You also have a problem with reddit that people who are slow tend to attack those who are intelligent. Its not a conducive environment for intelligent chat. Of course the result is reddit loses out. I mean the problem is that people proably consider them well informed because they check reddit all day. But thats the real tragedy because they are not. If you think reddit is bad now, wait until every creep has found it and the good people have been driven away. It happens to every community. But bitcoin may be the exception at the development layer, but nothing is guaranteed.

The main point of banning alt-coin discussion i presume it to get rid of the shills who pump other coins. If you were around when dogecoin rose to fame you would understand. That got really annoying having to open bitcoin subreddit and hear about dogecoin everyday. Especially when they had their own subreddit. So when something goes  wrong in another crypto currency, posting about it is not excactly shilling. So it is understandable why mods would have a more lenient approach then. What you have to understand is that no forum is perfect. If you dont like it here, just leave tbh.

@_date: 2016-11-29 13:37:22
There is much more demand for blockspace than there is available. If people who do frequent tx move to LN, and are happy with that, then fees in the dumb block space i want to call it, go down. But this opens up oppertunities for various buisness models to utilise that blockspace. So miner fees wont go away, im sure of that. LN wont replace it, LN will be for people who use bitcoin as a retail payment system as far as i can see. But not everyone is using bitcoin for that.

Dont you think its anti-consensus? It may not be immediately clear with BU. But if it was trying to change the 21M coin limit (not that it would be succesfull) by posting over again about my BitcoinM client where M stands for more bitcoin. Because as the bitcoins run out and the price on each coin increases adoption will slow down and stagnate.

There are only minor differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum tbh. And thus both face the same challenges where Ethereum has a harder time dealing with them in part because of a less restrictive scripting language. Regarding the split in Ethereum, the rapid difficulty adjustment arguably made it more convenient, but it doesent mean that coins with longer difficulty retargets are imune from splits. All it takes is a contentious hardfork and you have an incentive to split. It doesent matter if the competing coin starts the second the fork happens. It can launch days later with everyones coins intact but with a changed difficulty/hashing algorithm.

I would like to hear your opinion of why you think there is a deadlock and perhaps what you mean by that. End of the day consensus is not settled via a shouting match on twitter or reddit. Its settled by industry people because bitcoin has become specialised who weigh the technical pros and cons of a proposal and this process takes time as each actor first has to make up his mind independently, then start work on accomodating the proposal in his corner of the ecosystem. At least thats how it seems to have gone so far. Why would it be different this time?
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:11:36
No. With SegWit you wont even measure transactions fees by kb because its too archaic. You will pay a fee based on block weight. Its slimmer, sleeker. Fixing malleability will allow for some decent payment channel tech aka Lightning networks. Which could be characterized by the multiple trains :&lt;

Ive realised something since this was last posted. First of all Chandler Guo is the bitcoin connection for these power companies. Yet Chandler Guo wants the miners (the power companies) to decide on network upgrades. But they are not interested in that, they just want to mine. They just want to convert energy and bandwidth into money. And they always ask Chandler what to do. So when he says that miners should choose what to do about SegWit, that is a stalling tactic. Because they have no clue and they dont care, because thats not their specialisation, that is Chandlers job. Can you imagine chandler guo asking the power companies, "So what do you think about SegWit?" The power companeis dont give a shit. They just want to mine bitcoin and they want chandler to make sure it works. So i dont know about his vision of having individual miners taking responsiblity for network upgrades. It seems that kind of lies with pool operators. Therefor i would like to know what Chandler Guo thinks about SegWit and what the possible hold up is.
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:28:44
Please keep in mind i used the term decentralized scaling, which raising the blocksize limit is not. You can "scale" bitcoin 10x if you are willing to increase burden on nodes 10x by raising blocksize 10x, right? Is that what we should consider scaling? I dont think so. But you tell me. Also i have had it with this debate. Sorry.

There is no way around that regardless of how you look at it. No amount of blockspace will save you from a spam attack i would argue. I would argue that when blockspace is scarce it limits the time a spam attack can run. And because of the transaction fee system, there is actually a solution around the spam attack when it happens. Just outbid the spammer. We are actually moving into an era now where spam attacks wont even happen because it will cost too much money. Look i feel like we are veering of course here.

I think most people understand that SegWit does not exclude further blocksize limit increases? I mean why would that be the case?
Also there is no bitcoin leadership per say. And maybe thats the problem. The vacuum is allowing shills to twist the narrative and do propaganda to make Core and Core proposals seem worse than they are and what not(But i dont know why. No idea what their train of thought is. ). The people who i have quoted at least are more than capable of thinking of themselves and also understand bitcoin better than the average person i would argue yet seem content with the softfork.

@_date: 2016-12-09 15:04:30
I dont agree. Ideally the bitcoin network should be a matrix of strong nodes. And the nodes that are in the hands of buisnesses are not strong since they are susceptible to regulation. All it takes is a law and the nodes among buisnesses will arguably vanish. So if we rely on an infrastructure that is vulnerable to government interference we have a problem. That does not seem very strong in my opinion.
Look, i am of the opinoin that bitcoin is the resistance. We dont need tanks or jetplanes. We just need ak-47's (aka. nodes. I view the nodes as weapons). Even if the ammo is expensive it doesent matter. If enough people have one, the government wont be able to do shit even if they have tanks and crap. Does that make sense?

Because its launching soon? You buy the rumor and sell the news.
And what do you expect for a new blockchain? Butterflies and unicorns? The risk something will go wrong is high (An attack, bug or exploit for example). And then after it has proven itself it needs to develop a network effect, get developers, get wallets and so on. And in spite of all this its already in the top5. *facepalm*. 
That being said it doesent mean it wont rally if Bitcoin starts rallying because markets now a days are freakin retarded but whatever.

I dont know about you but i dont feel strongly about this.  Care to explain what the problem is? Coinbase could contribute devs, so could Kraken, or blockchain.info for example. But only blockstream is seemingly doing it? Its much better than nothing i would argue. And since bitcoin is open source and core devs can be reached easy peasy for questions etc, there is little reason to suspect foul play. Anyway. Im out.

@_date: 2017-08-26 15:19:12
The way i see it, Bitcoin Cash can find itself in a unfortunate situation where price drops and then miners leave, and EDA drops difficulty which decreases blocktime. Then miners mine it, dump it and leave until blocktimes are reduced further. Is it not fair to call this hyper inflation at least in a cryptocurrency sense? They will have to create more and more coins to stay competitive with Bitcoin payouts, but those coins will put negative pressure on price, which will require even more coins to be created to stay competitive.

Imo having miners control max blocksize is like having fishermen decide their own fishing quotas. Im not saying fishing quotas are a good idea, but what would happen if nodes could no longer run on desktop hardware and consumer grade internet connections? Isnt that the risk you run when miners control blocksize? And isnt there an argument to be made that miners deciding blocksize is hardly laissez faire? (Think OPEC who control oil production, or the Fed deciding interest rate. Its the same ordeal.)
For example look at Ethereum who have miners deciding max blocksize (they call it gas limit, but its the max block size essentially) it is the devs who tell the miners which blocksize limit to use which is perculiar?

Full nodes are more reliable. You post directly to the network and recieve directly as well. So nobody can cheat you*. It is unlikely that someone is able to cheat a SPV node but the risk is there. So if you are a big exchange or something you probably want to stick with full nodes.
*Obviously you can be cheated if there is a double spend attack, but this risk is also there for the SPV node so its irrelevant when comparing the two

It seems like an open invitation to political attack. 1) Produce a plugin 2) campaign the world and get as many people to adopt it as possible 3) profit..
It seems like it doesent really solve anything. Deep down the people who support BU are people who are afraid of debate. In their mind the problem is not the blocksize limit, the even bigger problem to them is that there is no solution yet. They are out of patience. So the bottom line is that some people dont have patience, and is throwing a fit. You dont solve this with plugins in Bitcoin Core :&lt;

BC management. What is that? And since blockspace is a scarce resource if it is to remain decentralized and trustless, does it not make sense to keep focused on the monetary use case.

It doesent make sense to talk about alt-coins in a bitcoin subreddit. If you dont like the rule there are other places i imagine. I mean each significant alt-coin has their own sub.

People who like alt-coin pumps know where to go i presume. I think you think the whole world revolves around this subreddit tbh. Its fucking stupid.

Thats why its dishonest, because everyone knows that 51% attacking the network is not going to be productive. The miners will not be better off from such an event due to loss of confidence in the system.

Not sure how much money we are talking about, but there are different tiers on kraken. Not sure if the fiat withdraw options are greyed out or just not visible when you dont have a verified account. But you should make sure you have a verification tier that is adequate for the amount you wish to withdraw.
Also the website can be a bit tricky. When you go to funding, you have to go to the withdraw tab, and then you have to select euros on the left. I hope this helps.

If we asume that each family only owns one gun, they would also only have 1 cold storage. And one deposit per month.. Per family. Assume there are 4 individuals in each family. At least two adults. Than you can multiply it by 4. So thats 28,000,000 people at least that are supported by bitcoin cold storage. Some people propbably access their cold storage even less than once per month. But lets face it, these 28,000,000 people who trust bitcoin with their savings arent going to come at all once, which is why SegWit makes sense and later schnorr because it increases capacity in non drastic steps which encourages frugal use per individual, and decentralization, which ultimately benefits the security of the system.

Only the hardfork that does not adjust the witness discount - if it is deemed neccesary - will be contentious, and rightly so.

When you can peddle the software you can make it seem as if there is more support and the idea is better than it is by rigging the narrative and essentially manipulating people to fork.


Thats just your opinion. The rules here are clearly stated and i tried to give an explanation for them. But you wont listen. I mean i know why your argument boils down to censorship, its because your idea is not actually censored, you just want to make it seem as if it is hoping to play a victim and get support that way. I dont even think you are aware that this is the tactic. They dont want to discuss their idea fair and square, they just want to look like victims and get support for it that way.  Lets see if it will pay off.

If it didnt require a hardfork to increase blocksize maybe just maybe it would have been done already. But nobody knows how to do a safe hardfork afaik.

Hardforks are really not ideal. First of all when is the last time one was done? And bitcoin looks alot different today i would argue. For something as benign as SegWit, softfork is ideal. If when bitcoin hardforks, better make it count. Problem is among other things that co-ordinating a hardfork takes alot longer. So if you think SegWit is slow to adopt, just wait until a hardfork is proposed. Holy shit.
I mean, the contention that sorrounded SegWit, which is a softfork, and is really benign, shows us that bitcoin is hardly ready for a hardfork. Right?

You are another one of the stallers. SegWit doesent change any bitcoin transactions. Its a new way to transact on-chain that does not affect any of the existing methods.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:21:52
They are not preventing the limit to change. They simply havent proposed to increase it. Anyone can propose an increase, but previous attempts have not been very succesfull. Like bip109, classic, bu and so on. SegWit is pretty popular tho, and i think it will pass eventually. Then we get blocks twice as large all a sudden! :) Damn those core devs

@_date: 2016-12-18 16:25:57
Yea and its going to take ages to coordinate a proper hardfork. And when your proposition starts out with Bitcoin Unlimited, its already contentious. You are never going to get a clean hardfork with that shite. Admittedly im no Bitcoin Unlimited expert, but it seems like its contentious and they make no effort to collaborate with core. How is that going to end well for your proposition? Not that Core are gatekeepers, but they have alot of goodwill and expertise. Failling to acknowledge that, just comes to show what an inferior organisation you are. Thats just my 50 cents.

@_date: 2016-11-28 15:20:54
 I wouldnt say it makes it easier. The spammers would still have to pay for the entire block. If your transactions take up 3.6mb of blockspace that is a hefty fee you will have to part with. Not sure a spammer can keep that up for long. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:35:25
Eh. I dont see any companies controlling bitcoin development. Quite the contrary. For example bitcoin core has resisted time and again demands from the largest companies in the space.
This doesent mean that i am against developer grants. I think bitcoin devs should be the most highly paid, but you make it sound as if bitcoin development is influenced by special interests to a high degree, when in fact it does not seem to be the case.

@_date: 2016-12-09 12:35:39
If you have any savings, paying $5 or whatever to move it around is nothing. It doesent matter if its only $1,000 you got saved up. Any kind of savings will  benefit from the bitcoin network vs the banking system IF the bitcoin network is kept decentralized and secure. Even if the fees are more expensive than legacy banking system, its worth it, because bitcoin is arguably more secure and frictionless and so on.

@_date: 2016-12-08 21:46:44
but segwit is 2.1 mb blocks. miners just need to signal they are ready and we can have it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:54:11
Nonono, segwit are new "rules" that you can follow if you like. Thats the point of the softfork. So you can keep using the old tx still. Even the qoute you give does not say that all transactions will be in the segwit format. 
*edit* A word and a sentence.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:55:16
There is no official way to vote in bitcoin. So if you are a miner you can signal you are ready for it. But there is no point if the network isnt behind it. So if you run a node that is SegWit compatible, and if you talk about SegWit online, you have come a long way. Id say thats more effective than mining it tbh. Its just that people tend to give miners way more credit and people shouldnt feel insignificant just because they dont mine. They still have a voice and a therefore a vote. And before you bring up censorship on r/bitcoin let me just explain to you that talk about big blocks is ok. But campaigning for alternative implementations that creates them, without consensus, is not. The distinction can be hard to understand for some people but i dont know what else to say. Sorry. Im leaving now.

Good luck with that. Bitcoin just needs to resist attacks "from the inside". You cannot do anything about gov anyway. If it wants to ban bitcoin so be it. But under those circumstances it should still be able to function. High tps and every day commerce will take place on layers that could be ruined by government. But IF gov made crypto illegal there wouldnt be much demand for TPS in the first place..
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:53:42
Do you think it would be a good idea the way bitcoin looks today if miners were in charge of the protocol? I guess thats a silly question. But basically everyone does SPV and the miners validate, and we trust them instead. In that case i think off-chain tx entirely are better. While blocksize limit is still low enough so everyone can afford to run a node when they DO need an on-chain tx.

Im not sure its neccesary. Standing alone against the whole network is going to be very intimidating. It would be enough of a deterrent for any malicious actor. For example if more miners signal for SegWit, ViaBTC are going to start feeling intimidated which should lead them to signal as well sooner or later.

Nobody is doing that. Its a side effect of too much demand and no safe way to increase capacity. If there was a button someone could press to increase on-chain throughput by a factor of 2 or 4 they would do it. But bitcoin doesent work that way by design. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:01:52
I have no idea why they only want to fork at 51%. Does that make their idea any better? Why not just fork right now, with whatever percantage of hashrate they can get away with. They wont be attacked unless the coin is more profitable to mine and i suspect it wont be in the first while at least. They have nothing to worry about. If they really believe in their idea they should just execute it like every other alt coin. But they dont have the balls to do that. They want the miners to fork, so that they can blame them if the idea has flaws. "Well, the miners kinda forked, so thats not our problem." Im so sick of it.

Thats an interesting concept. But my opinion is that mods probably dont have time to check and will always miss something? Besides its sort of an unwritten rule to check the comments section for any malfeasance on ops or the linked articles behalf. Said in another way, the current situation is not perfect, but its also not a big problem :) Thats just my 50 cents. Have a nice day.

Yes i tend to agree. But what else do you want to call it?
I simply enjoyed the article because it was so succinct. And in hindsight i regret not saying "i dont agree with everything he says" because thats what i was thinking of adding to the comment at the time. Anyway have a nice day.

If BU is bad change and the network adopts it anyway, what is the point of continuing to work with or on bitcoin? It seems that the general idea is that BU is bad when you filter out the noise. I would like to see a discussion like this thread where people are discussing the consequences of miners deciding the blocksize. But it doesent happen because the pro-BU people cannot win in such an environment. They do not have convincing arguments to make changes they want to make.

I dont get it. Price is up. Adoption is up. Mining fees are up, good for miners at least. What is the problem? People thought bitcoin price would crash with full blocks but it havent.

@_date: 2016-12-21 14:38:08
The odd thing is that volume has sort of been going down but price has been rising. So that suggests to me that demand is not rising significantly, its just that sellers are getting more greedy, for lack of a better term.

It seems likely that the ones that hardfork in a contentious environment are the ones most likely to lose because services will not be compatible with their fork. One of the primary reasons BU should not be taken serious is that they dont seem to understand this. Deep down i think BU knows they will not be able to get consensus on their policies, all they care about is how many people they can get mining it. It seems they havent thought much further than that.

@_date: 2016-12-18 17:07:55
In what way was Core involved with the scaling conference? Besides its a conference, you dont go there to work. And BU holds their own conferences afaik directly sponsored by them, and do Core developers get invited? Anyway im talking about like, every day relations. And I think Greg Maxwell will agree with this. Hes tried to approach them and be proffesional, but they dont return the favor. And this was actually Greg Maxwells point. When they burn the bridge basically, to the group of people who understand the code of their product more than anyone, thats very unproffesional. You need to keep a good relationship with someone, if your product is based on &gt;90% of their code in case you need help. Right? And thats not all. There are several red flags re bitcoin unlimited.

After blocks have become full i think the more relevant chart to follow is [transactions fees per day in USD]( 
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:16:30
Giving miners control over blocksize limit is a larger change than you think. Bitcoin has running fine for many years without them having control over it.
So there is no immediate reason to give them control. I think most people should not concern themselves with the development of the protocol because its not an easy thing to do, and they only end up stressing themselves..
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:07:25
this position is a convoluted way of being against it i would argue. Its not a sound approach to bitcoin governance. segwit is a big deal, being agnostic seems pathetic if not lazy, not sure how else to put it.

the longer it takes to get to $1,000 the easier it will be to pass through. $800 being a good example. We was in the $700 range for a while. Then wupto do, $800 fell and then it was straight to $900. If we stay here for a while again. Then boom, $1,000 will fall easy as well.
Sorry this is a very simple theory.

@_date: 2016-11-18 15:05:01
There is no way upgrades can be dictated by developers. Bitcoiners (This includes exchanges, hodlers, and everyone..) chose to run the software that interacts with bitcoin, the developers do not chose it for them and niether should the miners. The miners signalling readyness is just a formality than anything imo. 
How would you feel if miners hardforked bitcoin without your consent? That wouldnt be good for the bitcoin price. Hardforks needs to have more than miners approving it since they dont represent bitcoin, and it has to be done in a carefull manner, so that the ecosystem will be disturbed as little as possible. Thats my 50 cents.
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:40:05

How did you come to that conclusion?
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:42:09
If we stay at 20% for another week or so then i will change my mind. But looking at this [chart]( the blue line should keep growing at the same pace until it reaches the dotted vertical line. However the dotted line will more or less instantly move up as more miners signal. If it keeps ahead of the blue line then adoption will end up looking like the previous softfork which is the green line. I hope that made sense. Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:26:30
altcoins will pump. and it makes no sense to make a compromise since 2mb blocks will be enough for 10 months at least while further scaling is worked on. if there was a fork to 8 or 16mb it will take years to fill up. problem is that empty blocks are a moral hazard. i dont expect alot of people to get this.

@_date: 2016-12-18 17:20:51
It really is the fault of the users. There are several blockchains out there. And even alternative payments like paypal. If the fees are "high" on bitcoin, thats because there is alot of demand. And some people are being priced out. :P IT kinda sucks, but its nice to know that people are willing to pay 20 cent fees to move money on-chain. Now if we can only get SegWit asap so fees wont get totally out of control. because i suppose there are people who are happy to pay even 40 cents or more for basic transactions on-chain.

Dissent is a funny thing in bitcoin. Because it cant exist in the protocol as far as im concerned. So what good is Roger Ver allegedly manufacturing dissent? I presume he is trying to influence miners to force a bigger blocksize on the network (But it could be anything. A higher coin limit, faster block times, bigger mining reward etc.) the idea is that if the hashing power changes the protocol, and say 75% of it switches to this changed protocol, then everyone else will follow. Its essentially a 51% attack. I think its an interesting proposition, but i dont think honest miners will do it.
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:14:56

The last time miners tried to do political pressure they failed. Look up segwit2x.
Tl;Dr 90%+ of the hashrate was signalling segwit2x but they ended up ditching it in the end and it just comes to show miners have 0 leverage and no ability to govern.

What is that supposed to mean? If a miner makes a larger block than 1mb it will be orphaned
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:59:17
I upgraded to 0.13.1 almost minutes after it was released. Since 0.13.1 has preferential peer selection, ie. it prefers other 0.13.x clients, i ended up having to serve the blockchain to alot of people. My bandwidth usage went through the roof. So when you say we dont need thousands and thousands of nodes, i disagree. Because the burden is shared by everyone. Every time a node goes off-line you increase the burden on the remaining nodes. Which increases the risk they will go off-line or behind a firewall. Maybe there will be a few super nodes hosting the blockchain. And maybe that will be fine. But the more the merrier i would say. Ideally node count should go up.

Its not a serious problem. Its superficial from bitcoins perspective. And an inconvenience at best for the end user. But all that has to happen is a change of habit.

Thats just my 50 cents.

Bitmain hasnt really had an incentive to upgrade when theres so little competition. So maybe they just waiting for the competition before announcing their next miner.
@_date: 2016-11-28 09:33:14
*facepalm* BU has nothing to do with scale. Its just the biggest miners choosing the limit. What do you think they will chose? ViaBTC suggested 2mb (But this is a political choice).  Its such a big facepalm. With SegWit you reach 2mb via a softfork and the tx are healthier for the network overall. Then there is the moral hazard of the large miners choosing blocksize to begin with. You know they are going to be lobbied to increase it aggresively. Eventually the miners and a few large companies will be the only ones who can afford to validate and that will be the end of it as far as i can see.

Bitcoin hasnt evolved quickly enough? Compared to what? Jeremy is being a scumbag like brian armstrong.

For example now that SegWit is in the pipes, do we hear them speak about it so we can get the ball rolling a little faster? Absolutely not apparantly. Rather he quits. What is that about.

Partial PoS is basically just checkpoints and it doesent stop someone from doing a 51% attack or using hashrate to extort the chain if they wanted to.
That being said about 90% of the hashrate supported segwit2x but they still didn't do it. If anything that suggests mining centralization is concern trolling.

@_date: 2015-08-01 15:49:46
I asume that people who need to do urgent transactions will pay a fee that makes sure the transaction will be processed imidiately. People who can wait with their transactions will schedule them for when the load on the network is low. Im sure it will be trivial to figure out at what time of the day when it is the smartest (cheapest) to do a blockchain transaction, and to automate/schedule the transaction/transactions for then.
Other than that, as the blocks fill up off-chain solutions will be pursued more. These are the things i think is going to happen. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:00:16


This doesent proove anything in and of itself. But the better the consesus the better. Arguably 80% support is better than 75%. And 100% is the best possible. Why are we not aiming for that?
And im tired of hearing the 1% can dictate and hold you hostage, because thats not how it works. You can go to your alt-coin where the rules are perhaps different, or start your own. BUT MY FUCKING MONEY IS ON THE LINE HERE. 75% IS NOT ENOUGH. You should feel the same to be honest.

As long as it costs money to attack the network, they will be kept at a minimum. But anyway, your original point was you cant manipulate hashing power which is false, and manipulating the transaction costs is also costly compared to what you get out of it.

If devs can persuade miners to jump on a blockchain that only has 75% chance of success what will the next thing be? 60%? 50%? Every time the devs try to pull this off they bring into question the integrity of crypto currency.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:24:12
It doesent really matter if BitcoinXT is defined as an alt-coin or not, i think it is:D And it doesent really matter wether Satoshi is against BitcoinXT or not. We have all the information we need. It should be possible to form an objective opinion on which one is better and then go with that. Yet there is a dispute it seems. Some people are against BitcoinXT, and i can understand why, since it has alot of changes:( Gavin and Hearn are playing high stakes right now. Its not the correct thing to do as a bitcoin dev. Not when we dont need to play high stakes, considering the blocksize limit is of little signifcance at this moment. They may even be right. They may have the correct solution (im not sure.) But they have to wait, the timing is not correct. And its causing alot of unnecesary concern right now.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:33:17
Its important to note that being against bitcoinXT is not neccesarily the same as being against a blocksize increase. BitcoinXT is only one way of doing it. And it does so by doubling the blocksize limit every two years, starting from 8mb. I personally think thats a crazy idea, especially considering the 1mb blocksize limit is not a problem yet, and that when it starts being a problem, increasing it will be straight forward to do. In other words, simply waiting for a proper consensus wont cost us anything. 
Its also important to note that BitcoinXT includes several patches and not only the exponential blocksize increase mechanic.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:32:18
I dont know wether its fair to say any hard fork is switching to an alt-coin. Its certainly switching to alternative chain. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:27:28
Im fine with changes, what worries me is if devs can get them implemented without full consensus.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:00
Would you still run it if you had hundreds if not thousands of users or if you ran a multi million mining farm? Doesent really matter if the code is frozen or not.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:43:27
Perhaps there is no definitive answer to the blocksize question. But we are not in a rush to answer it either. There is no reason not to wait for full consensus yet.
@_date: 2015-08-31 18:53:29
I think without a wide variety of buisinesses using bitcoin and the protocol, that would be akin to the internet without websites etc. Sure there is a protocol that the government cannot regulate per se, but without the layer of buisnesses its not worth much. Correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:35:50
If it doesent have full consensus its an alt-coin
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:30:30
I think it will be a while before there is a dip. The bcash dip fooled alot of people i presume and they wont get fooled so easily again. On top of that, that dip turned alot of BTC into stronger hands.

We are the train. And we need to figure out what speed we need to change tracks. If we are going too fast, the train derails. If we are going too slow, that will be better than going too fast. BitcoinXT wants to go full speed and change the track at the same time. Why are we speaking in analogies?
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:46:28
The best remedy for the blocksize debate is a proper solution. This solution is not known yet however. In that case it's best to wait before doing anything. So in other words things are working as intended.

The bitcoin network will not neccesarily be exponentially larger in a few years, and niether will computing neccesarily be exponentially faster. We are not even having problems with the 1mb block size limit, and when we do, there will still be time to implement a simple increase. So why is this kind of patch being pushed now?
Hearn chooses to believe the deadlock regarding the blocksize increase is a bad thing, but thats his take on things. In reality there is no sense of urgency, there is no rush. The blocksize debate will remain locked up for as long as it has to. Now they are pushing a patch that as far as i can see are pushing some questionable things, under the guise of being a solution to everyones problem. A problem that didnt exist to begin with. Im talking about the blocksize limit. When it becomes a problem, it wont be that big, and we can reach consesus at that time. Its going to take for bitcoin to reach the blocksize limit, consistently, for people to agree on what to do. So just wait until then. It wont cost us anything.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:31:33


Its acceptable for now. This is another reason XT is wrong. We dont need it yet.
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:24:59
Then who should? You were talking about a website, which builds on top of the http protocol, right? Perhaps the programmer shouldnt decide on the feature set of a website, whatever you mean by that. But when it comes to the actual protocols the various services, wallets, website's etc. use, i see no-one better qualified than programmers/engineers to "decide on the feature sets". Because entrepreneurs build solutions on top of that. They connect the bitcoin protocol to the end user. BYE
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:17:35
Let me just chime in and say this is not a blocksize issue. Most people understand that the blocksize limit will have to be increased at some point, but what people cant seem to agree on is when it should be done, how, and how much it should be increased. Or perhaps even removed. Mike Hearn sees this as a bad thing, for some reason. I dont understand that belief tho. Its important to wait until there is complete consensus before making changes to bitcoin. Hearn and Gavin are trying to make changes without having full support. I dont like that approach. As a skeptic ive been linked to the same post by Mike Hearn dozens of times. But why cant people in their own words explain why they favor XT? Why isnt anyone other than presumably Hearn being vocally in favor of XT?
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:02:45
To be honest that particular system sounded promising. But it breaks a principle in bitcoin and it could perhaps be exploited to block tor.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:52:24
Here is the thing. The right thing to do ought to be supported by more than 75%, thats how we know its the right thing to do.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:11:48
For BitcoinXt to become Bitcoin, Bitcoin would have to cease to exist. For that to happen, more than 75% of the hashing power has to switch and stay on BitcoinXT, so BitcoinCore effectively ceases to function.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:35:50
Indeed. BitcoinXT is a huge patch, with numerous changes, and even the way it approaches the blocksize limit increase is questionable. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:30:05
And if we only have a few nodes as a result of the large blocks the network will be very efficient
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:45:54
Hearn why are you pushing for BitcoinXT now? I mean, the timing seem to be unfortunate, since there is lack of consensus. And how come BitcoinXT is designed so it will only require 75% consensus so to speak. Isnt it best for bitcoin when changes are 100% agreed upon?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:51:58

And why is the rule even there? We dont need forum rules and active mods to protect the future of bitcoin. At least thats the whole idea behind it. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 09:13:46
Imho the block size limit should be 3x the number of legitimate transactions. then there is room for spikes, and a spammer will still have limited success once he reaches the blocksize limit. How to make the blocksize limit stay ahead of the legitimate transactions is hard to say...
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:52:07
It would be nice if this rule was removed.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:54:40


Are you serious? By that Logic BitcoinXt should just be released and then people can use it if they want. Gavin and Hearn both know no-one is going to use BitcoinXT if they did it like that. They are trying to get enough hashingpower from BitcoinCore over into their coin, so that BitcoinCore effectively ceases to function.
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:57:43
Majority is not good enough. Thats only 50%+1. I hate to be the nitpicker, but the rules you are used to from democracy or whatever will not apply to Bitcoin. There needs to be more than 90% consensus before a fork imo.

You cant say for certain that a majority wont embrace a continuation of the block rewards. Right now, it seems like a crazy idea. But down the line as the block rewards diminshes, it could become appealing to keep them.
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:21:41
It would be interesting to know how attached the devs are to the idea of a hard cap. In the end it may be raised, as was the case with dogecoin. The argument for doing it is more persuasive than the argument against it. In the end i think its just a matter of time before it happens, because devs can change their mind, and devs can even leave and new ones join. I dont find it unlikely that the cap will be raised at some point, and the closer we get to insigificant block rewards and the more popular bitcoin becomes the likelier it will be imo.
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:07:47
I feel like this is going to happen. They want the newly created bitcoins to continue to subsidize the network. And it will require to much strenghth from a developers perspective to be against this kind of pressue once fees start to rise. So eventually the bitcoin cap will be removed or raised over and over again.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:40:42
You are actually incorrect. Or maybe i am not understanding you correctly. Bitcoin development is not centralized per say, thats why the blocksize debate has been going on for as long as it has. There is no generally agreed upon solution yet. And I dont think it wont come until the current blocksize limit really becomes a problem.
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:09:16
Okay. There is alot of info to soak up regarding this bitcoinxt change. To be honest i wish it didnt exist. I prefer changes that are not so significant, especially considering bitcoin is currently working ok. Oh well. Have a nice day.

I think when it comes to crypto, being too conservative is preferable compared to the opposite. This is something most people wont understand, and it will never become the popular belief, but thankfully bitcoin is market based, so something like XT and a crypto currency that is not being conservative with impatient devs and community wont be a a thing.

This analogy is incorrect
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:28:52
I dont know wether 1mb blocksize limit can be considered an advantage, but its certainly not a problem yet. I am concerned that basically an alt-coin is being proposed to solve the problem with the blocksize limit, when it isnt even a problem yet. I am concerned that the change doesent require full consensus. I am concerned that the blocksize limit doubles every 2 years, on this coin. By all means, Mike Hearn and gavin should make their coin, and see if people will use it. But trying to destroy Bitcoin Core by getting a majority of its hashing power into BitcoinXT and by doing that forcing people to use BitcoinXT is not something that pleases me.

Why is it all of a sudden called censorship? When dogecoin discussions was removed, and lightcoin discussions, it was just because thats the rules.
If anything people should push to get the rule removed that makes this sub bitcoin exclusive. Because thats what BitcoinXT falls under and thats why its being removed.
I dont mind the rule being removed. I dont mind reading about other cryptocurrencies in this sub. I think i know why the rule was implemented. It was when dogecoin was having its golden age, and nothing was happening in bitcoin land. The dogecoiners was comming in this sub and bragging and boasting about how good they were. It was getting annoying. But it was the wrong thing to do then, to make that rule. I guess you can call it censorship. That rule should definitely be removed the more i think about it.

I can copy everything from Bitcoin. Even its blockchain. Call it BitcoinSomething, it will definately be an alt.coin. The difficulty will be redicicoulsy high, and more than half of the coins will already be mined. But it will still be an alt.coin. But its besides the matter. What conerns me is it doesent take full consesus to switch. And that the blocksize limit is going to increase exponentially when there is no cause for such a thing.

Ironically Nodes have not much to lose. Why all the fuss about being safe?
Arguments like this can make it seem like there is consensus when in reality people are just running XT because its "safest". Do you know what i mean? This bitcoinXT is causing quite a stir, and i am quite frankly disappointed in Gavin. He makes it seem like we need to act now, or else all will be lost. And then he presents BitcoinXT which has alot of changes that had previously been resisted. This does not bode well for bitcoin, if XT is adopted.

Let them do that? If people want to use their stuff and talk about it, that's their concern. To me it seems like you are trying to prevent bitcoinxt taking of. And to be honest I hope the network, bitcoin etc. Is stringer than that. We don't need someone to tell us what to do, protect us etc. If bitcoinxt takes over so be it. It would not be mistake. The fact that oppononents of bitcoinxt seemingly have to resort to censorship? Kind of prooves there is no real argument against it? No real danger. Are you telling me bitcoinxt discussion is being removed for the own good of the community?

What?  Only 2 devs are behind XT. And no, miners don't need choice. They need certainty. 1 chain that they can focus 100% on, and they need to be sure other miners are doing the same. They need to be sure other miners won't split or the chain they are on wont be obsolete.

Scary. I actually stopped using them because they havent upgraded their trading engine for months, its been rekt, and they removed stop orders and stuff like that. Honestly seems like they stopped caring or maybe they are just extremely overloaded. Its a shame because i really liked Kraken and trusted them but not atm.

@_date: 2017-11-23 19:41:19
what the fuck is wrong you?
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:11:33
If thats the case that shows  how a majority can be wrong. Because BitcoinXT is an alt-coin. Other alt-coins have traditionally started their own blockchain. But bitcoinXT uses a copy of the bitcoin blockchain. Its still an alt-coin that needs hashing power, and their goal is to get the hashing power that is currently running on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-28 12:09:40
Still not convinced this is the solution. Its not objective enough:/ A flat increase to a new arbitrary number is too arbitrary. If the difficulty can automatically adjust based on the amount of hashing power, you would think it would be possible for the blocksize limit to adjust based on the amount of transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:43:05

It didnt have to be this disruptive. They didnt have to go all in. We could have just waited until the blocksize limit became a real problem, and then take it from there.

@_date: 2015-08-16 11:41:11
I think its going to be 3. But this is because bitcoin until now have resisted any attempts at dealing with the blocksize limit question. I dont think BitcoinXT will be good enough to convince enough people to switch. However, it is one of the closest attempts. There is a chance for it working out. But i personally hope it doesent. Significant changes to bitcoin should have to be supported by everyone, not just 75%.

That is the lamest argument ever
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:06:55
Majority rule is not something that should be incorporated into bitcoin. Rather, changes forks etc. should be based on close to 100% consensus or unanimity. Anything else deducts from the integrity of Bitcoin. You are probably thinking in the back of your head that there will never be 100% consensus but that doesent make sense. More people than ever agrees that the blocksize limit will have to be raised, the question remains by how much, when and so on. The closer we get to consistently full blocks the more people will agree, the bigger the demand for a solution. Until then, please no shenanigans like Bitcoin XT. If you are impatient, or easy panic, bitcoin is perhaps not for you at this time. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:47:32
I dont understand what you are disputing? Is it because you dont know? Or believe the patch is harmless? BitcoinXT is changing bitcoin to better suit Lighthouse
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:51:05
This is true. But bitcoin-xt is an alt-coin, if they decided it wasnt, that would show bias toward bitcoin-xt. Damned if you, damned if you dont. They just need to remove the rule that prohibits talk about alt-coins. The discussion here needs to be freed. Its not that bad if we see topics about other crypto currency related stuff. I know the rule didnt always use to be here. I think it was made when dogecoin was having its golden age. The dogecoiners came onto the sub boasting and bragging how good they were to the point it started to get really annoying. But even by then it was the wrong thing to do, to not allow talk about other crypto currencies.

Well Karpeles became  victim of his own succes. He was dealing with more than he could handle. I think his intentions were good. He started playing the fractional reserve game after the US government took 5 mio. USD from the exchange. I don't think there is any coming back from that, under the circumstances in 2013 where very few had heard of bitcoin or had any interest in it. Things are a bit different today where I think an exchange is more likely to receive money. Never the less, who wants to touch an exchange the US government had on their bad side.  Anyway. The fractional reserve thing did not work out. And ultimately mtgox ran completely out of money and had to go bankrupt. Of course hackers was to be blamed for the missing bitcoin that was artificially created and/or owed to customers. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:44:06

What is it? What are you talking about here?


Well like i said, when block rewards become insignifcant and/or fees become prohibitively expensive, adding bigger block rewards again will seem appealing. Its nothing that you need to worry about now, except for perhaps preparing yourself mentally for the idea.


I dont understand what you mean. I didnt say i was going to make an argument for why people wouldnt choose an inflatioary altcoin. I dont even know what you mean by that.


Sure, why not. But it seems the most convenient solution down the line will be to have 1 crypto, and have it contiously inflate/be mined. The thing is, the hard cap is ideological, it wont matter in the end as most people will come to realise, if its increased. But i dont want to discuss this further as its irrelevant. There is no cause for action right now, its merely an interesting thought and it can be fun trying to predict the future tbh. But i am done. Thank you.

The rich need bitcoin as well to protect their wealth. It could potentially become a good hedge against inflation.  Technically it already is when you disregard the dips. BTC is generally going up.
Btw. the poor will not be able to transact on-chain in the future unless some serious scaling solution is invented. But i guess its ok, because you can build a whole new and free financial system on top of Bitcoin that does NOT charge exorbitant fees. Anyway, lets see.

Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity. For some reason you cant talk about alt-coins on i dont like the rule.

Compare this with the financial sector. I know its probably a stretch because its far bigger than the bitcoin economy. But mtgox was the pinnacle of bitcoin trade once. It failed. And we moved on.

Arguably the correct limit should be larger than the legitimate amount of transactions. Arguably it should be large enough to allow for spikes in such transactions. But small enough to put a spammer out of steam relatively quick.

Well. if a better solution hasnt been found and congestion is beginning to be a problem you can take steps from then to adress that. XT is the most retarded solution, because first of all it ruins the integrity of bitcoin, and it contains various other patches as well. Just to deal with a problem that dont even exist yet.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:01:54
Thats what im thinking, but it was mentioned on here that over time one of the key differences between Core and XT if both continue to exist is that block rewards would be different. I dont know what was meant by that.

Traditionally alt-coins have copied bitcoin core, made a few changes, and started their own blockchain. BitcoinXT copies bitcoin core, made a few changes, but also copied the bitcoin blockchain. Its still an alt-coin tho. But i think its besides the matter. BitcoinXT is a nice try at attempting to deal with the blocksize question, but i dont think its good enough. It also have several other changes. Among other things, its supposed to better work with Lighthouse.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:06:35


Should be


There is no deadline other than when the blocksize limit is consistently hit. Thats also when a solution will be chosen, and it wont neccesarily be a compromise.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:08:17
True. People still dont learn. Watch it bounce to $8k again
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:22:53
I heard this argument before. I also heard that nothing will get done if it requires 100% consensus. But how do you know? If 1 person is against, the change should not be implemented. Then these people have to sit down and figure out what to do. If you ignore what 25% of people have to say you are setting up for something that does not have the proper integrity. Dont trials in the US rely on 100% consensus from the jury?
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:47:43
For something as controversial as BitcoinXT wouldnt it be better if there was full consensus? If something cant get full consensus, it probably doesent belong in bitcoin. And keep in mind, just because there is no consensus now, doesent mean there wont be in the future.  Compare this to the significance the blocksize limit has right now (not much). Once it starts to become a problem, you will also see ideas, and more consensus for which direction to go. So, just wait. Its the only way to be sure, and it wont cost us anything except a temporary increase in fees at some point, thats worst case scenario.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:20:13
You make it seem as if BIP 101 is just raising the block size to 8mb when in reality it will be raised to 8mb and then double every two years. You also make it look like the problem are the devs who dont agree with BIP 101 when in reality the problem is the devs trying to take bitcoin in a direction that does not have complete consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:03:09
Why is the target only 75%?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:57:06
Here is my take. When bitcoin really makes news is when it makes new ATHs and that brings in more adoption. But how does it make new ATHs? Thats from people hodling, right? That increases the price alot since there is less to go around. Heh
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:00:54
The devs of bitcoin XT really made sure they did what they could to make people switch. Lets see if they will. And if they dont, i worry what Hearn and Gavin will do since they basically went all in with BitcoinXT.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:14:55
Just keep in mind that there is a conflict of interest. People want bigger blocks because it promises them lower fees. This is not neccesarily in the interest of miners. There is also the issue of block rewards fading over the next couple of years which is also going to be interesting.
I personally feel BitcoinXT is the wrong way to approach the blocksize issue, because it only requires 75% consensus, and it includes alot of other stuff as well, that we probably dont need (But Mike Hearn do). Now pardon my ignorance, but why is it all being put on the line right now. Why not implement things as we go and deal with the problems as they arise? As far as i can see, the block size limit will cause an increase in fees at some point, and then we will just raise it to something more apropriate.

@_date: 2015-08-02 12:01:06

@_date: 2015-08-19 17:58:54
I don't think so. When that happened the bitcoin network was not affected. Your coins were still safe. And It doesn't happen often anyway. Probably more reasons not to worry.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:31:55


What makes you think it will never happen?


This is going to sound lame. But i think there are two kinds of people in the world. Those who have seen the movie 12 angry men, and those who havent. You should be more afraid of a majority making decisions on your behalf, than a system where the single individual can object and stop the process. But thats just the thinking you have been conditioned too. The majority knows better. I digress.
For something like bitcoin, we need full consesus especially when the changes are as significant as they are in bitcoinxt. Also please dont forget that it doesent cost us anything to wait. This is Mike Hearns best chance to make changes to bitcoin, by using the blocksize limit drama to implement his ideas. But the best thing for bitcoin is to wait, and really dissect and scrutinize the BitcoinXT patch, any patch for that matter, because hitting the blocksize limit is not going to be the end of the world. On the other hand, BitcoinXT could become a huge mess.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:27:00
You spend too much time in r/btc look at you. You have become them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:21:47
It makes perfect sense if you think about it. I can clone bitcoin and the blockchain and give it a different name. It will have no hashing power, more than half the coins will be mined, and the difficulty will be extremely high. But it will still be an alt coin. But its besides the matter.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:40:24
That is a simple way of looking at things. Because first of all, raising the block size can be done in different ways. And it dosent have to be done right now. Certainly, what the block size should be is debatable. There probably isnt a definitive answer. But then fast forward to BitcoinXT which includes an increase to 8mb, and then a doubling every two years until blocksize is ~8,000 mb.
BitcoinXT also includes various other patches that have not have consensus in the past and that are not urgent to implement. 
So, if this is  how bitcoin development is going to be. Significant changes with limited consensus. That have me worried.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:56:26
I can see where you are comming from but bitcoin is not like any open source project. The world wide ledger is not supposed to fork, and compete with itself because of lack of consensus. But in the end BitcoinXT fork if it happens probably wont be the end of a so called world wide ledger. Its problematic however that some devs take the ledger in a certain direction, in a way that does not require full consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:09:53
And that seems like a dangerous game to play. I wonder how much support it currently has? Bitcoin XT includes alot of changes and sets a worrying precedent. There ought be a larger consensus required. Its not impossible to get 100% consensus on a change to bitcoin, the timing just have to be right. I personally dont think its time to do anything regarding the blocksize issue and to be honest the market seem to agree, at least that would explain why there is still a dispute.
@_date: 2015-08-31 06:00:51
Why would they?
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:36:34
Is that going to be different with BitcoinXT? Will that neccesarily be a good thing?
So far the network has had to agree on changes proposed by developers, and anyone have had the ability to contribute, and people have. Its not as bad as you make it look to be.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:54:11

I think either way the moon scenario is unavoidable. The question is who will be "allowed" to touch and work with bitcoin. If heavily regulated only the rich and powerful have the resources to do it. Sounds good i guess, since that means enough capital and so on, you would think. Ie. no bankruptcies etc.
But on the other hand, "the people" or less people will have a hard time working with bitcoin providing solutions and solving problems etc. Which is a loss i guess.

I dont know about the mining aspect. 75% seems low. That certainly is not equivalent to the example you give of 1 miner keeping the network back. 25% being ignored is alot. I also dont believe its possible to be a liar or a schill dev deliberately sabotaging development for any significant amount of time.

@_date: 2015-08-16 17:56:34
Its not a question of wether or not to increase the blocksize, but how, when and by how much. BitcoinXT is one way of doing it, and at the same time they also implement various other changes with BitcoinXT. On top of that they dont require full consensus for XT to go into effect which is even more problematic.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:12:56
I dont know where to start. The biggest point the spammers proved is that you cant spam the bitcoin network for long. Other than that, delays on the bitcoin network is a relative thing. If you pay the correct fee, you wont have delays. Thats not saying the blocksize limit should be used to manipulate fees.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:44:36
Dont attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity. Its possible the mods considers bitcoinxt an alt-coin for their own reasons. Not because they have a stake in the blocksize debate, besides BitcoinXT is not as much a solution to the blocksize limit as it is an implementation of various patches that have not been able to make it in in the past.

Well the tipbot could bundle the transactions, pay 1 fee and everyone could get their tips into their bitcoin wallet.

Whats not to understand? Do you think when the 1mb limit start to be a problem, it will remain in place?
I think it makes sense to wait. Because first of all, there is no consensus. And second of all, the implementation that is part of bitcoinXt is not good enough.
Its convenient that only 75% have to be in favor for BitcoinXT because its probably only 25% that believe the implementation is not good enough. But a majority is not neccesarily correct. These are just some things you need to consider, on top of the fact that we are not in a rush to change things.

This is more difficult to explain that i thought. Thats why i deleted the other reply.
The only resamblance BitcoinXT has to bitcoin is the name, and the blockchain and most of the software which they copied. Most alt-coins thus far only copied the code but started their own blockchain. The only way BitcoinXT is different from other alt-coin is it uses a copy of the bitcoin blockchain. Miners will eventually have to decide wether they want to mine on BitcoinXT or Bitcoin. You must understand its an alt-coin. But would this really be enough to disuade you from using BitcoinXT? That would be ignorant of you.

By  paying the neccesary money to get in on the bitlicence you are basically ahead of the curve.

I dont really care what you call bitcoinXt. I think its interesting to note its an alt.coin. But there are alot of changes, and its problematic it doesent require full consensus. Things would be different if the bitcoin network was on the verge of collapse because the blocksize limit was too small, but thats not the situation we are in. The bitcoin network wouldnt even be on the verge on collapse when the blocksize limit begins to be consistently hit. BitcoinXT is an overcomplicated solution as far as i can see, that sneaks various other changes in, that probably wouldnt be possible otherwise. The simplest solution would be to implement a new blocksize limit, when the current one starts to be a problem. I mean, thats the time we will have consensus. BitcoinXT is a terrible idea. You basically risking a fork, two competing chains, lost mining revenue, people dont know which chain to trust, and so on. Just because they wanted to increase the blocksize? Fuck me.

260 euro, the price will be this when the block reward halves as well. Half the hashing power will vanish because its no longer economyically viable and the bitcoin network will be stuck until difficulty adjusts. But because of those events people have lost faith in bitcoin and the price will dwindle still until the price is below 2013 levels. Then it will enter a period of real stagnation, about a year or two before people will have forgotten or gotten bored with whatever else they were doing, and get back to bitcoin and pump its price again. Then the cycle starts over.

First of all dont compare bitcoin with other things that have decision making processes. Because they are likely nothing like bitcoin. I think you present a retarded argument for lack of a better word, when you say a minority can excercise power over the majority if their voices are heard. Its the other way around. If you ignore the minority they are being blocked by the majority. This is not how bitcoin should work.

@_date: 2015-08-17 18:31:36
How does your thinking apply to something like bitcoin? Nothing has existed before it. With something like bitcoin its arguably better to be reactive than proactive. At least when it comes to the block size limit. So what if fees are going to rise at some point? Maybe thats what it will take for the first increase in BSL. Or do you believe there will be less consensus the closer we get to the limit? I expect the focus and the drive for an increase in the block size limit, to increase the closer we get to it.
So let the debate last for as long as it has to. You have a solution ready, thats great, but its not time yet. And i dont like the fact that it only requires 75% of the hashing power to take over, that stinks. Why was the target not 90% or something higher?

I dont believe miners have an incentive to keep a low blocksize limit. Short term it may be of benefit, but only ever so slightly. fees make up a tiny portion of miner revenue atm. even if they double or triple. You also have to consider that if the blocksize limit is raised that is potentially more fees for the miners in the future. The only problem is if miners/the network dont believe they can handle larger blocks, but so far, things point toward it can. But that doesent justify BitcoinXT and the way its supposed to be implemented imo.

I believe the Litecoin market is rigged. Its hard for bitcoin to be rigged considered the vast amount of exchanges, and the size of the marketcap. But i have a feeling litecoin was pumped by chineese exchanges (okcoin!) and because its such a small market and there are so few exchanges, the rest of the market just jumps on the bandwagon. Whats strange tho, is that Litecoin hasnt completely crashed yet. Its still up more than 200% over the last 30 days.

In case you didnt know, litecoin was trading at $8 earlier today. Thats incredible considering it was around $1.5 last month. So to answer your question. Why wouldnt it be dumped?

Well in order to understand this i think i have to start from the beginning. Basicially the government is a group of people with guns who may use them against others if they dont do as they say.
For example this group of people may decide that selling drugs is not allowed, and will shoot anyone who dont comply. Of course things are not that simple. Its the police and military who have the guns and the so called politicans who make the rules, more or less. But in the end its the same. The government is a group of people who may initate violence against you (force you to do things).
If we didnt have this group of people using violence to control others we would have a free market. There wouldnt be anyone to coerce you into doing things a certain way or even prohibit you from doing them entirely.
The black market is sort of the same way, except it operates in areas that government have made illegal or impractical for the free market to operate. The key difference is what options people have if they get screwed. You have little options for restitution on the black market, because you cant be as open about your situation which leads to an increase in criminal activty. Not sure if that answers your question.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:12:22

When you fracture mining in so little pieces does it effect the effectiveness of the operation? Is a mining pool with a few big fucking mining farms better even tho it has the same hashing rate, as a mining pool that consists of millions of independent devices trying to mine?
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:26:22
I see. But things can quickly become a mess if the politicans try to manipulate the economy. Its better if they leave it alone so it can grow strong enough to export on its own. But a economy is not good or healthy if it has alot of exports. Its healthy if there is little regulation and little taxes (preferably no regulation and no taxes, no state), and if it has sound money :) If those things are in place it will grow over time. It will have growing pains tho, every economy has this, but as long as the politicans dont get involved everything will be fine. We are at a point now tho, that the economy is so skewered, so borked, that this wont work today. What ultimately needs to happen is a bankruptcy and a chance to start over. But even that comes with uncertainty. Because when power structures collapse (governments etc.) new ones tend to form,  and they can be worse. So time will tell:) Have a nice day.

I hope they will stop giving Greece money. If they don't,  Greece will be in much trouble short term. But it will force them to reform since they will go bankrupt.

Off blockchain transactions are arguably cheaper and more effecient. Exchanges rely on off-chain transactions when people do trades. If every trade had to sync with the blockchain, well, that simply wont do, so they keep an internal ledger and when person a or b  wants to withdraw or deposit, it is typically done via with the blockchain to in a way set the ownership change in stone.

MASF's are the fastest way to scale bitcoin. So if we have to wait 7 months for miners to fall back in line, that could still mean we get Schnorr faster, compared to having to do it all with UASF's from here on. UASF's also puts too much emphasis on devs. Perhaps this is just a matter of personal taste, but i like devs coming to consensus, lobbing the softfork to miners, and then miners get to work activating it. It seems more decentralized, but at the same time also more convenient. But you tell me.
A UASF will also create much more tension between miners and users than we have now. I cant see it being a good thing going forward. We want to shed this tension, and i think the best path is to just let Jihan in particular run out of steam. The idea is he will eventually capitulate after trying to spearhead several proposals himself and end up failing and then signal segwit in the end. I dont think he has 7 months left to do this war. I dont think he can keep it up. BU seems dead, and its going to be bad for Jihan when he is the only one left supporting it. But last but not least, IF jihan doesent come around and signal segwit before signalling period ends, then we can do UASF. It will also look much stronger at that point because "Miners failed to activate it, even tho they got 12 months".

The only reason hes a libartarian is so he can sleep at night. He says hes a libartarian and thinks hes doing great things for the world by cllaiming to be one.

The problem i have with that is that it sounds harmless and simple when you say increase blocksize to 2mb with a hardfork, but it may not be. But also im a little fuzzy on that, because maximum blocksize will already be 4mb with SegWit, although the full 4mb probably will not be used as it will require special transactions. Anyway thats besides the point. The actual blocksize with more or less full SegWit adoption - which is expected because of segwits benefits compared to the old transaction format - is 2-3mb. 
I dont see how the 2mb hardfork proposal fits in here.
@_date: 2016-02-15 21:06:50
The classic movement is an angry mob. I dont consider it east vs west. We already know they are in favor of blocksize limit increase to 2 mb, and its duly noted. Why do they want to take over the protocol?

But what if that's already the case? -which I believe it's not in bitcoin yet, but segwit proponents think it is-
can you elaborate on this? segwit is a blocksize increase. in fact segwit is the equuvalent of going from economy to buisness class. seats are comfier, roomier etc. (this is a metaphor for the increased blockspace and improvements like malleability fix)

Are you talking about 95% hashrate or 95% community consensus (Which cant be measured by the way.) but you need to be able to prove consensus for a hardfork without any "reasonable doubt" in order to take the bitcoin name. Thats not where segwit2mb is at, and thats not where bitcoin unlimited is at etc.


Fyi a majority (And a majority of what? hashrate?) is "only" &gt;50% which is vastly different than 95% you said earlier. Please get your terms in order.

@_date: 2017-04-20 00:56:17
there was a segwit signalling void, so it seemed like low risk for Bitmain to counter it with some BU shenanigans. But if more miners start signalling SegWit it will put pressure on Bitmain which previously didnt exist. So is bitmain getting their way? Im not sure. Lack og signalling is more a symptom of bitcoins decentralized nature imo. I hope more and more miners find the courage and/or wisdom to signal segwit.

ideally bitcoin PoW should be sound. No more optimisations to be made so the playing field is as even as possible. Otherwise you are going to end up with miner centralization, and although the incentives still do not work out for attacking the network, bitcoin does become weaker because the possibility is there.

Do you think they would be that cold and let segwit expire? They may be cold, but they are not that cold. I dont think so. But they have plenty of time to stall it and try their own things, it costs them not a whole lot up front - except for theoretical losses in the form of a supressed price, but thats not really because of segwit stalling, its more because of contentious BU. And i mean the miners arent Insane, they tried to spearhead BU, and they will proably try and spearhead extension blocks, but when proper support has failed to materialse for both their only option left is activate segwit. I find it hard to believe they will try something different again. And every time they feel, the better segwit looks.

I dont agree. If the network cannot run under adverserial conditions in the end nobody benefits. Today bitcoin is not under a threat from government, but if it is, for example if the large mining farms are banned, or if transacting bitcoin or interacting with it entirely, is banned, then what? If you need enterprise level hardware to do it, the government could play whack a mole all day? The reason bitorrent works is because everyone can seed and leech from home. 
Last but not least I dont understand why proponents of fast and instant payments want to implement it on the bottom layer. 1) It does not scale and 2) Bottom layer cannot be fast, cheap or instant compared to second layers anyway.
You know how the lizard can shed its tail if it detects a predator. Bitcoin second layers work the same way. If it gets attacked by the powers that be, bitcoin can shed its second layers but the bottom layer could survive.

I am fine with waiting 18 months for segwit. Especially if in those 18 months bitcoin purges jihans tomfoolery for good. Why would it do that? Well he would be responsible for segwit not activating and it makes him look really bad. The UASF kinda steals all the attention, and in my opinion its done for the wrong reasons, ie. people are impatient. But please correct me im wrong and why segwit must activate asap.

@_date: 2017-04-22 13:41:03
Im not sure he is bullshitting. Imo what he should have said is "They will try to increase it". Because it depends on if miners are willing to activate it, and if the community wants it and devs wants it etc. There is no guarantee of this if/when the time comes. It is  also possible than Jian Zhouer wont even be around by then. Remember that he came out of nowhere only recently afaik.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:13:19
No they couldnt. What are they going to do? Hold a meeting and announce a fork? What if people dont follow the fork? Status quo seem better than a split. It sucks that some miners wont pull the finger out their ass and signal segwit, but what can you do? Holding a meeting with them wont help, because if they wanted to signal segwit they would already be doing it. I would like to know if these miners are cold enough to block segwit until november when signalling expires. And i would like to see what happens then.

I see mining becoming less centralized now. This ASICBOOST has been used by Bitmain since early 2016 at least. If it gets fixed it will be a big blow to them, because i imagine they basically rely on it at this point.
Remember this data center? 
Probably relied on ASICBOOST continuing to work. They have to scale down now because they will be competing fair and square with others. Those are just my personal speculations.

Meh. The miners are bluffing. These sort of reactions are what they want. Eventually they will come around to signal SegWit. They cant avoid it forever. Let them try things like BU it only makes them look worse as it fails. Patience is key.

Also the node is the best way for you to get the full benefit of bitcoin. Bitcoin doesent make much sense on any level if nodes are prohibitively expensive as far as i can tell. Mining was already taken out of the homes. If nodes are being taken away as well, what is the point? You will require a 3rd party to even do on-chain tx.

You could probably quantify it in court, by presenting your case. If you can prove without "reasonable doubt" that the economic majority is behind something, you can go ahead and enforce it.

Not sure what the big deal is? Why didnt they just signal segwit from the start?
Have to keep in mind that every LTC miner was pretty much signalling segwit, but then antpool added tons of hashpower as well as LTC1BTC which is someone who didnt start mining only until recently. Why do they require this type of meeting to signal segwit? I dont get it. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:05:04

let miner signallimg end before really pushing for the uasf. imo its too early to give up on MASF. even tho majority of hashrate seem to be acting unproffessionally we have to cut them some slack. the absolutd best outcome is MASF segwit, UASF segwit is the same as saying miners are inherently evil, which is very bad for the duture of bitcoin. We have to cut miners some slack. let them try everything before they signal segwit. Hardfork threat, extension block threat etc. if its all in vain which i suspect it will be, the end result is a stronger bifcoin imo, and MASW,  the way it should be.

If Jgarzik really thought bitcoin was in trouble why havent he abondoned it in favor of something else like ETH? It seems to do what he wants. Fast blocks, no strict blocksize.

You coul sell them, and even withdraw the money, nobody would notice. Not until everyone wanted to sell and withdraw at once and it became evident they had been giving out more btc than they had.

I was not aware Bitpay supported S2X. That is news to me considering they devote so much time to Bitcoin Cash lately. But your right, making a clear distinction between the three on a protocol level is the most courteous thing to do.
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:06:03
You know.. Part of me thinks S2X is just a joke. They put 0 effort into it. Miners just signal, Garzik just cloned core repo, and then they've been pretty much quiet since just watching opponents pull their hair out kicking and screaming. Maybe they are just laughing. Maybe they are just trying to drain everyones energy in preparation for the real take over.

With deflation you get alot of capital available for investment since more people save and sit on money eager to Invest. They know the money Will be Worth more in a few years so they dont want it sitting idle, they want it making even more money so they constantly seek investment oppertunities. Why do you think cloud mining is a thing? And altcoins? Etc. 
As the bitcoin economy matures people will Invest less in cloud mining and alts, and go for more Sound investing. One thing is certain, people arent just hoarding. They spend when neccecary and Invest the money otherwise. Some people prefer just to save, but thats ok, you also see these people in the legacy inflationary system.

We are not talking specifically about the MIT licence.
1. Original author is preserved on Github when you merge code from other repos. This was stripped when Bitcoin Cash merged.
2. Bitcoin Cash dev said to the media he solved the issue before Core - But he took Cores code to solve it.
So this kind of conduct can get you removed from github if it keeps up.

Probably more than you think. I mean most of the coins have already been mined but bitcoin is not even mainstream yet. So per definition the coins will be in the hands of a small elite as bitcoin adoption grows. Is this is a bad thing? I dont think so, its neutral. Because this "elite" cant just sit on their money, they have to spend it when they want to do something for the most part. So coins distribution broaden over time.

Miners got bills to pay. They will not be mining something like 2x unless its worth more than BTC OR it has lower difficulty. But none of that will be the case. So just to be clear
1. SegWit2x will not be worth more than Bitcoin
2. SegWit2x will not have a lower difficulty
Ergo not alot is going to mine that crap

Even in a stateless society if someone tried to do a switcheroo with bitcoin (Ie. you thought you bought bitcoin but when you tried to withdraw you got Bitcoin Cash or S2X) they would get sued. So i dont see what the problem is.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:56:54
Not sure why this is getting upvoted. First of all miners dont control who is in charge of the repo. Besides, there are many repos. People can run whatever software they want to interact with bitcoin. The reason Core has not lead a hardfork yet is because they dont want to risk the chain split yet since they dont feel its neccesary yet. They will obviously stick with the network as it is now. If current miners want to do something else what can you do? Thats their choice. I just think they are making a mistake because they are obviously splitting the network. The only reason they can avoid two chains is by attacking the one they are not on. But this costs them money and it also causes uncertainty in crypto as a whole and even the chain they bet on will survive will drop in value, so less money for them. 
tl;dr the miners are batshit crazy if they proceed with a hardfork next month
@_date: 2018-07-16 05:22:25

This chart doesent show SegWit adoption. It shows number of SegWit transactions included in blocks. It seems that legacy transactions are currently outbidding SegWit transactions, so they get priority in the Block. However i dont see the incentive to do that so either someone is maliciously pumping legacy transactions or people are pumping their fees by mistake putting SegWit at the back of the queue so to speak. When people get tired of paying high fees this Will solve itself.

I have a feeling BTC will go very deep. It rallied on people not thinking about its pitfalls or any of the sorts. People just kept buying because it was going up.
I suspect its going back to $1-2k, and if people still want to hold and use it, maybe it will recover.
One of the most important things to keep an eye on is the fee market. If there is no fee market there will be no fees for miners and thus little to no hashrate. So only if a fee-market develops and is sustained, then i think people will feel comfortable buying it again. Its a precarious situation because how can a fee market develop? It seems people will just use cheaper alternatives, so imo. right now fundamentals are bad. That being said i am by no means an expert, and if someone has a better thesis im all ears.

Unless there is a fee market the coming halvings are not going to be fun.
Things that prevent a fee market: Altcoins. 
Why i believe BTC will go to $1,000 next. Because of altcoins. Going to $1,000 will be like a chemo therapy. And from there BTC price will rise based on adoption and less on speculation/fomo and likely altcoins will have collapsed. 
But lets see.

It's btc available at any one time. You can close your LN channel and in fact you have to at some point and then the btc available shrinks. But the fact that the btc available at any one time is increasing means the network is growing. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day.

J carver raised the point that poker is one of the few games where you don't have to be the best in the world to be professional, just everyone else that you play against.  in pc gaming that's different, where people need to be hyper skilled to get a sponserhip/team. Only a small percentage of players earn money In  pc gaming. This sort of thing can change if more money is involved in the competitive scene, in the tournaments etc. And bitcoin could help that.

Probably the bitcoin foundation wont go bankrupt because people will continue to support it although its basically a black hole. Its an illusion, dont really get much for the money, but if people feel thats what they want to spend their money on i dont really care.

Well something like that have never been tried before, to my knowledge. But the problem is the user might think he will be ripped off in the beginning. Then there should be a special rebate for paying with bitcoin, but that will seem unfair to people who chose to pay with credit cards.
I think the optimal solution is a bitcoin credit card, pure and simple. An institution or infrastructure where recurring payments are possible. It will require trust, and a 3rd party, but for most cases it will be viable.

Im into bitcoin because i realise politics dont work. Politics is like a smoke screen that gives the impression the government works for us, and we have influence. But in the end we dont. I like bitcoin because im for limited government, im actually for no-government at all. And bitcoin puts a limit to what the government can do because its not feasable for governments to borrow bitcoin, at least not in its current state. So rather than borrowing money to finance wars, welfare to bribe the population etc. it has to tax them directly which is going to make people not fond of these kinds of programs. And thats going to keep the government back. 
Its also why i think it is inevitable the government will "attack" bitcoin, or try to shut it out of the economy. But i dont think it will realise and truly begin working against the bitcoin community before its too late. Before its too big to stop.

The devs still have a bigger incentive, if not qualifications, arguably, than a wallet owner when it comes to deciding a blocksize limit. The code is even open source, and there is alot of due diligence before something is pushed. You cannot say the same if the wallets suddenly decide the blocksize limits. There are not the same checks and bounds, and there is still the conflict of interest.

Its easier to take the governments long arm less serious if you have a long arm yourself. I wonder how things will play out in europe if the financial crisis comes back, and things start to get significantly worse. The governments will definately try more of the same to solve the problem. More debt, more taxes. At some point people are going to say enough is enough. For americans, i think its easier, because of the lax gunlaws. Im not saying there is going to be blood in the streets, quite the opposite, because the government must recognize its not worth trying to make armed americans to submit if they have had enough. In europe it may be different, because generally, at least where im from, people are not armed. The government can have its way. Oh my god this is a dark comment.

The end users do not have the proper incentive in keeping the blocksize in check. It should ultimately be controlled by the blocksize limit and that should be established by devs based on a variety of factors such as internet speeds, hardware capabilities etc.

I am surprised to see your post getting gold and so many points because its so bad. The price is not a indicator of wether bitcoin is dying or not. Its volatile and it has always been.
The companies failing or pivoting doesent have much to do with bitcoin. Because for every company pivoting, there is a new one, or two that are investing millions into the phenomenon.
And regarding the blocksize limit, if there was a clear solution, and the blocks were full, and it wouldnt be raised, then there would be cause for concern. But i dont see that scenario playing out. When its time to raise the blocksize limit it will be raised.

I think it will be the other way around. A dedicated farm with dedicated hardware that focuses on upgrading and expanding, will outperform computers that mine on the side unless they become extremely widespread. But i think the mining farm, with his ASICs will always have an incentive, because his hardware is better than the computers mining on the side. If that makes sense. Unless the 21 inc. hardware is more powerful than the ASICs, i dont see the ASICs or farms going out of buisness.

Sharing is becomming a big thing. In Denmark we can use gomore.dk to share our cars with others. We can even arrange trips with strangers to share the cost of gas/petrol. With airbnb we can share our appartments with others. And so on.
I dont think its unreasonable to share your computer with others, when you are not using it yourself. For example to mine bitcoin. But the way bitcoin mining is today, the hardware you typically find in PC's cannot compete with the specialized ASICS. I dont know wether this is what 21 inc. is trying to solve.

Digital gold, for sure. The blockchain is something that should be used as little as possible, and as careful as possible, because. It grows. And grows. And grows. Any transaction that does not need to be on the blockchain - THOSE ARE PEOPLES COFFEE PURCHASES. THERE I SAID IT. Should not be on the blockchain. Its fine for the moment, but once/if this bitcoin becomes a mainstream thing. People may as well use their credit cards and what not to get a coffee. Who knows, maybe the credit card will be denominated in bitcoin.

I dont think paying the devs would have made any difference for bitcoin. At least i would like to see examples of open source projects that go to shit because of lack of funding. A system like bitcoin where the devs potentially hold the tokens themselves and the fact thats its fancy new technology is enough to keep competent people on board.
I would also like to know how, once money is involved, you keep things fresh. Whats to stop a dev for just hanging around to collect a salary? At what point do we know we get enough for the money? Are you saying if there was no money involved, no salaries, bitcoin development would get no where? Godamnit

Nobody said central banking was supposed to be permanent. Nobody really know wether it was going to work. Nobody says we have to have central banking, but of course the BoE chief does not think this way. He believes central banking is the shit. But its not. At least alot of people believe otherwise. So perhaps thats more important to ask, not wether a form of bitcoin or blockchain technology will be compatible with central bank issued money, but rather, wether we need central bank issued money at all:)

Let people come to bitcoin on their own. There is no reason to push it, i think. Especially considering that it doesent scale atm.

Do you trust the engineers at the core of development or do you trust the end users to decide the block size? The end users will always vote for bigger blocks, because they arent the ones mining or relaying them and they probably dont even understand the blocksize limit to begin with. So there is an conflict of interest, and lack of incentive to do the right thing. If the engineers/devs are responsible for the blocksize limit they are practically impartial, so its to be expected that will give us the best results.

More rules to solve the problem caused by rules:/
If only it was allowed to talk about alt-coins here, this whole XT mess wouldnt have existed in the first place. Why is alt-coin talk not allowed here?
Just to be clear i am not neccesarily saying XT is an alt-coin but mods have deemed it as such, and thus removed content according to the rule that forbids alt-coins. But why is that rule there?
I feel like i am missing out on crypto related news because of that. I think its important we have as few subs as possible, so we can get as varied opinion and content as possible, in order to stay as informed as possible because that is ultimately what make us a stronger community etc. imo.

I think you are approaching this wrong. Someone says Bitcoin is about fraud and extortion, they have to proove it. You dont instantly go on the defensive and try to proove them wrong. Right? 
They might bring up Silk Road, and then you can say that the US dollar facilitates drug trade on a much larger scale. And that will kind of be EOD, if you do it right.

I think there is going to be less people in the world in 2050. Because what cannot keep up is the economy itself. When the fiat system comes crumbling down, a system that everything has become so dependent on (stupid humans, why do they get themselves into things like this) everything from food production to energy will be handicapped, if not for a while, while the economy hopefully transitions to something more sound. The collapse of the fiat system could also bring back dictatorships and totalitarianism across the globe which will definately put a stopper to population growth.

Bitcoin adoption is lagging. CME Futures was a big hit, but now that price has crashed to the max who is actually interested in adopting this thing?
So i guess what it comes down to is the hodlers. If they continue to hodl and defend some kind of low for the next year or so, then a new bull market can start, and maybe people will be more keen to adopt it then.

Even better, fees in terms of BTC go down as BTC exchange rate goes up. So even with blocksize of 4mb, its possible miners still only make 1BTC in fees. BUT in terms if CNY or USD thats still a huge increase compared to a year before because 1 BTC is worth much more. RIGHT?

Its kind of funny. The bitcoin Ecosystem is pretty small. Most merchants and services will probably adopt the SegWit rather quick. I mean the more transactions you process per day faster you are likely to be in adopting the SegWit because of the discounts -so for most people the adoption will be fast. And thats the whole point, because SegWit tx are a smaller burdon on the network compared to the vanilla ones.

Im actually curious about the review of the lightning network but thats besides the point.
The question is if Vitalik really believes in the stuff he spews or not, and i dont think he does. He only does what he does if he believes it can pump the price of Ethereum. But he would never say this. Probably only the people who are closest with him understand this, and maybe they never even discussed it. There is just a common understanding of pump Ethereum or else. Thats all that matters. Anyway, whatever. Who actually cares.

The people who are in favor of conservative blocksize limit increases are in a minority. If you explained to anyone on the street that there was a limit of 1mb on bitcoin, and that currently it causing a backlog, 99% would respond it should be increased significantly because they dont know any better. Thus if bitcoin was a democracy, the code would have had a blocksize limit increase a long time ago.

You are probably not aware how bitcoin works. Hell i barely even understand it. But bitcoin gains it value from the fact its trustless to a large degree. So if you started to turn bitcoin into a payment protocol, fast confirmation times, large blocks, and lots of data parsed every second... Then eventually... Eventually no-body would be able to to keep up. Remember each transaction is validated and everything is checked and rechecked to make sure no-one is screwing around. Thats how we even know that the 21 million coin limit you speak of works. So if we make validation cost significant amounts of resources, ie. cant be done with consumer hardware, then bitcoin loses. And it wont even be a store of value or a payment protocol tbh. It wont be anything at all. Have a nice day.

I dont agree. When a block is found within seconds of another in bitcoin, miners dont include transactions because they get a substantial block reward regardless. In a situation where fees are the majority of the block reward, miners will fill the blocks to the whim regardless of how fast they find them.

Well my point is that most people dont know what they are talking about :) Thats why i say 99% would have increased the blocksize limit already, and that it is incredible how strong bitcoin is. It resists these knee-jerk responses with incredible fevor. I like it.

Well congrats on this important release. Thank you for all that you guys at Core have been doing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:23:56


Thats a very good argument. But, how will these companies benefit bitcoin? Lets say blockspace was abundant af. Then the companies will start to exploit bitcoin, im not kidding. They will absolutely enjoy that people run nodes and provide resources - for free - so that these companies can use bitcoin as a backend transaction system, or as some sort of cloud storage. 
So, why do we care what companies can use bitcoin for? They wont provide any value. What im interested in, is what are bitcoin users, using bitcoin for? Huh? And i think people like it as a store of value and money. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:45:27
Its funny. When you say that SegWit increases blocksize limit to 4mb someone will point out that the actual blocks wont be bigger than 1.5 to 2mb. Then when you say that SegWit enables blocks as large as 1.5-2mb someone will say that SegWit enables blocks as large as 4mb. There is just no way to win is there unless you specifically state every detail. 
But in response to your post, 1 mb of SegWit spam is less harmfull than 1mb of spam of vanilla blockspace. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:08:40
That will never happen.  People buy altcoins without thinking. They are completely blinded by greed. It doesn't matter how good BTC is. People will always buy them believing they will get rich quick, the irony is that there's so many people believing this that it's actually kinda coming true. Huge bubble.

I bet they negotate rates with their credit card company. So if they can get 10,000 TX per month they get better rates. This just off the top of my head, i dont know how these credit card deals work, except i have heard they can be almost extortionist. Ie. Merchants having to pay 3% on every TX and prohibited from charging the fee directly to customers and so on. Thats just what i heard.
But thats no excuse to make fees artificially high in bitcoin. Bitcoin is what it is.

Are people ignoring the elephant in the room? Bitpay was scammed and lost 5000 btc last year and their insurance didn't cover it. This seems to me to be a loss they are still struggling with.

Bitcoin is so goddamn revolutionary. Its going to put the legacy financial system to shame. Where else can you own your own exchange? In the legacy system that would take .... millions just to get approved. Then you have to make the exchange.. But in bitcoin, the market is much more competitive, and you can in fact own your own exchange and it opens up to new buisness models. Its awesome.

This makes no sense. Who is going to mine with these guys. They are taking a unneccesary risk associating their brand with bitcoin pools. Because the bitcoin mining space is so competitive and it doesent revolve around brands to begin with.

They are setting themselves up for a flop in broad daylight, unless i am missing something, maybe i am.

@_date: 2015-11-07 17:15:38
Not having the blocksize limit to begin with exposed the problems of not having one. And it was implemented. Whats important now, is to avoid problems arising from increasing it. In that case your hypothetical questions are not being helpful.

@_date: 2018-04-13 16:20:23
LN is still very much beta. Afaik fees can be several cents depending on how many hops you do. Also if you do any hops the transaction may fail, for now. More over you can actually lose money in the channel if you lose the device that is controlling it. You cant back that up (Yet). So just be careful if you wanna play with LN. Its like Bitcoin in 2009 tbh.

How much can square realistically be making from this?
Lets say 100,000 users bought bitcoin via them. And lets say the average purcase was $200. Lets say square earns 1% of that? Well ok its $200k earned. Enough to pay the salary of a single engineer :)

When you look at bitcoin and how it works with the confirmations and all that. It clearly looks like a settlement network. Besides its just rhetoric. What does it matter what we call it?

The blocksize must remain low so that the network can stay decentralized so the banks can do most of the transactions. Wut?
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:53:34
If this is how you view crypto currency it is destined to fail regardless of on-chain throughput since there *is* a technical limit to the amount of on chain-tps. Your argument is that when this limit is hit people wil no longer find the crypto currency useful. Which seems like a very narrow perspective.
As bitcoin demonstrates itself as a reliable store of value/actual money, there will be additional more consumer friendly transaction systems built on top. And thats the only way this thing can truly scale.
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:14:08
The thing about bitcoin is the market will turn and get ugly real fast. One day everyone wants to hold it and everything is awesome.

These spasms happen in a bull market. You have a few days with slow movement, then a big spike, then a few days with slow movement, then a big spike. Its not caused by news, its caused by the silent accumulation of coins. Each pricelevel is being wiped out, and then we test a price that is slightly higher. And if there is support there as well, then the price spikes a bit higher again. This will keep going on until we find the top.
*edit* And you better brace yourself because things are going to get crazy near the end.
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:52:52
We have to be sure that they arent fucking around. Although i think its prety clear that they are, in which case such drastic measures could be taken. But i think this is so personal to ViaBTC they will continue mining even at a loss until they practically are bankrupt.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:29:29
I believe there is a false narrative here. Some people are convinced the 1mb blocksize limit is going to stay forever when we just dont know if that is the case.
Which is why i for one dont like articles like these because it doesent tell us what we already dont know. Right?
More on-chain tx are good to some extent, and more fees for miners are also good to some extent. We already have a few conservative capacity increases in the pipeline which should be able to keep up with demand for now. I think the real game changer will be the vanilla blocksize limit increase, but there are no good proposals yet to increase it afaik. It will be interesting to see if Core can come up with anything.

Listen mate, keeping an eye on hash rate is going to do jack shit for your fee estimation. All you need to do is look at the mempool at tradeblock tbh. and if a block has JUST been found, you add a little more, otherwise you try to beat that median fee displayed with 1-10 satoshis if you want high priority. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:49:12
The way i see it is that people start running around the room not knowing what to do when price increases. And its reflected in the on-chain tx. People start to send bitcoin all over the place because they are excited.

If Ethereum is supposed to be this commercial infrastructure coin, who is going to run the nodes? When the CEO of a given company sees the bill, and starts asking questions, the Ethereum ties will be shut down in favor of more effecient solutions, i guarantee it.

There was a period in 2013 with calm waters where the exchange rate hung around $50 dollars after reaching $266. Then it shot up to $1000. Its likely going to happen again and that's because people are starting to think it won't. In a panic once the price starts rising a lot of people will be buying frantically because they don't want to miss the boat. But it's going to be bid up immensely because of this and ultimately correct again. Don't think speculative bubbles are a thing of the past.

Its so called pseudonomous. You can track all the transactions, in the open ledger, but the ledger does not contain the identity of the individual doing/recieving the transactions. So in this sense, you can be anonmous if you take the proper precautions - for example not reusing an adress and not submitting your identity when spending from an adress - sometimes not possible due to the nature of the service you are using tho.
@_date: 2016-10-28 11:52:32
bitcoin is entering a phase of high volatility. If you dont know any better you end up buying the top and selling the bottom when it corrects, before going back up again.

Well in the beginning there was also alot of problem with Bitcoin exchanges but the market matures and competition increases and the conditions for the end users increase. Im curious how Ethereum could improve the situation on the dark net market?

You know it just happens. The market is by and large a large tub of water. If you sway the tub gently from side to side eventually the water will make large waves and splash everywhere and uncontrolably until eventually settlning again. It gets out of control for no specific reason tbh. But when you cut the supply in half in an economic system that had just about adapted to the previous time supply was cut in half. You have to expect some crazy reactions. You see how the tub is being swayed?

It baffles me how strong bitcoin is. 99% of people would have increased blocksize limit a long time ago. Because its the the politically correct thing to do. But here we are "suffering" from a blocksize limit and price still going up. Good job bitcoin. I mean it. When historians look back they will coin as the real heroes.. and as the villain
@_date: 2015-11-10 08:02:35
Some people say that mining is being centralized. I prefer the term industrialized. The reason i bring this up, is because bigger blocks will increase bandwith use and thus costs for miners and nodes in particular. At the same time, mining equipment is becomming more specialised, and require signicant amount of capital and time to setup. Is this neccesarily a bad thing? I dont think so. This leads me to believe that removing the blocksize limit completely, and having miners decide themselves how big of a block they want to build, would be a feasable solution. I think its important to try it at least, because the sooner the better i think.

proper fee estmation is probably as hard as artificial intelligence. the variables are too dynamic, you know what i mean? That being said i love Core. 
But dont move the slider all the way to the right, because it can result in massive fee. The thing is that fee estimation is a gamble in the end. Its probabilistic. So when you tell core to give you 99.99% chance to get confirmed within 1 block. It will make sure to spend as much so it is 99.99% sure you wont get outbid. Thats how i got ripped off. But this is not a criticism of Core. Its doing what its supposed to. 99.99% certainty us supposed to be expensive. If you go for 95% you can save signicantly on fees. most people dont give a shit about this, but i do. Thank you.

Thats all hypothethical tho. I dont think a single individual or entity is in control of even 5% of the hashing power. Its important to note that there is a distinction between a pool and a mining operation. I dont think there are any mining operations with a concerning amount of hashing power. And i doubt there ever will be, even if some operations start making big blocks to push out smaller guys. Because its all relative to the difficulty in the end. If the equipment permits, and you can be sure that there is a demand, so someone will try to make it, cheap mining hardware. Then you will always have new guys trying their luck with bitcoin mining. I mean, these single entities whom you fear will take over, simply cannot compete with the world, even if they try to build big blocks to force some people out. Because if they were succesful, the difficulty would only rise slower, creating a bigger incentive for new people to join. Right?

First of all, fees actually arent that bad. I think they are 1/4 credit card fee. But dont qoute me on that. Bitcoin can also be used as a store of value. You can also use it to access the grey and unregulated internet economy. Gambling, Drugs and even unregulated financial instruments such as alt-coins. There are alot of things to do with bitcoin that is not possible in the legacy financial system.

Scaling of bitcoin is a real concern. If we just turn the dial up, scaling will be postponed. To me it seems you are not here for the long term. And then your wishes should be taken with a grain of salt. All you have to do is ask yourself if bitcoin can function with fees. And yes, yes it can. Its part of the design. Blocks are full, fees are rising, but price is also increasing.
That being said, you should not think you can meet with some people who know how to code, and make an agreement of what goes into bitcoin. Its a distributed system, i dont know what you were thinking (and the guys you met with).

I agree with what you say. The blockchain footprint should be as small as possible. But how small is that? The best way to determine that seems to me to be to set the blocksize free. Remove the limit or raise it enough that it doesent get in the way. Then miners themselves will decide how large blocks they will mine, how large is economical for them. It is nice to have an upper limit tho, so that node operators etc. will know in advance what their maximum bandwith usage may be.
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:37:49
This has happened several times before in bitcoin history. When the price starts rising rapidly is when no-one wants to sell. But then it takes a few guys to do it, and then everyone suddenly begins to sell. The only time people will no longer sell bitcoin is when bitcoins have have become so saturated in the economy anyway, and is readily accepted for just about anything.

I dont think its intentional. But it becomes propaganda because when the state is sponsering you, you are not going to be as big of a critic of the state.

I think there are more checks and balances on price than ever. It used to be 1 exchange with a questionable and  limited trading engine where trades took place. Today the exchange market is much more diverse with multiple larg exchanges, margin trading, shorting etc. I think this keeps volatility down. Thats not to say its impossible for a crazy rally, but i think the likelyhood is lower. Steady growth over a longer period of time seem more likely imo.

There is also the poor history of ETH with the hardfork to bailout the DAO. I mean all in all ETH is not attractive to devs who are serious about their work i would argue.

There is no such thing as the miners. They are all individuals with varying costs/profit margins. This is dependant on a variety of things. Many things in fact. From bandwith costs, to electricity costs, to rent depending on the size of your operation, cost of skilled labor and so on.
But you are still not getting my point i think. Should we be more concerned about fees or the bandwith requirement of participating in the network?
I think the blocksize should just be set free. In the end i dont think there is an economic incentive in building big blocks just to push out small guys. Bigger blocks will happen, because they can, and if you cant handle it you wont run a node and you wont mine. But other people will.

I think $333 will be the ultimate wall since its half of 666. It will then spiral down just under $300 and then continue its trend upward. I think right now $300 is the correct price, but people are in a minor state of frenzied mind, because the price has been rising so nice. But eventually the sentiment will change, and price will drop too low, before returning to just above $300 which is the correct price as far as i can see, in the comming months. So i would start shorting soon. That being said, this just my personal guestimate, and i only do it because trying to predict the price is fun. have a nice day.

I think the miners are trying to change cryptocurrency/bitcoin into something where they play a bigger role. So if they can make blocks really big that will be good for miners who want to control the network. But i still dont understand who would use the network then?

The most immidate problem is that its sort of untested. Its not geared toward being money. Maybe people will use it as such. Who knows. It relies on PoW which makes it equally good or bad as Bitcoin. It has a built in Difficulty bomb. If you were worried about the halvening. What about ETHs built in difficulty bomb? Maybe miners will fork to avoid it. I mean that will be an interesting event. I mean, things are going get toxic in the ETH community by then.
Bitcoin may go to some price level, and level of attention, that is lower than today. But it will never go away. Its fundamentals will still be there. It will still be money of the austrian school. Which is something very powerful. Worth holding. Unique. 
So when ETH is having its toxic moments in 2017. Bitcoin will most likely be on SegWit, a somewhat developed lightning network, and preparing for further upgrades such as Schnorr sigs.

You can enable RBF, and then you can try with a relatively small fee. It could take a week until first confirmation but you could save alot. And if the transaction never confirms and you enabled RBF for it before you sent, you can use RBF to bump the fee.

If there was a market to sell asics to you and i, to set up in our home, they would be making those. But that market is not here yet, most likely because difficulty is increasing exponentially. Ask youself this, if you could purchase mining hardware for $100. Would you do it, knowing profitabilty would increase significantly in a few months? Its not worth the effort currently. The problem, and its not even a problem, is that bitcoin mining is transitioning to more and more effecient tech. But its going to stop soon, and then you will see the ASICs get into even more peoples hands because mining tech wont take the same sort of leaps in effeciency.

I agree. But the government do not have the same control over individuals and institutions on the web, as it does IRL. So even some exchanges are forced to do certain things, it does not mean that all exchanges will be forced to do it. This goes back to my point of there always being a way of exchangin bitcoin, some will just have a higher premium than others, and possibly be a little more inconvenient.

Great, we all agree that there should be a hardfork. But HOW do you want to do it? Thats the hard part. Some people just want a quick 1-off to 2mb, others want to implement blocksize voting.. Its a huge mess.. SegWit is a nice compromise, thats not even a hardfork, and then it increase throughput by up to 80%, as well as deliver a bunch of additional benefits. So thats why im getting crazy thinking about that someone are actually going against SegWit. What do they know that i dont?

The exchange in question gets to decide wether or not they want something to do with your coins. They may give the reason they believe you stole them, and refuse to do buisness with you. And if you didnt, i mean, would you even want to do buisness with that exchange after that?

Bitcoins selling point was never network effect. The selling point was its fundamental properties. Those are still intact, which is why it has infinite patience. The network effect is a bonus. People who are leaving bitcoin, probably didnt care about the fundamentals anyway. But there are still people who do, and those were arguably the ones that got us so far, so why should it stop now? to the moon!

Why Dogecoin?
Dogecoin was founded on the idea that a digital currency should be fun and friendly, and we believe this ideal fits in very well for an in-game currency. 
Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin's value is much less than a dollar, which makes it better suited for a game currency. It just feels better to get paid 1000 Dogecoins rather than 0.001 Bitcoins. 
Dogecoin transactions are much faster than Bitcoin (~8x faster) and Litecoin (~2.5x faster). This means that putting money into your account or sending money from your account will be much faster. 
Dogecoin has support from many currency exchanges so you can easily convert Doge into the currency of your own country. However, we would encourage you to check out Dogecoin services online that will accept Dogecoin directly!

Ideally there will be a solution that does not rely on the blockchain to the same degree. Blockchain transactions in their current form needs to be used as little as possible and blocks have to be as small as possible. What i was thinking of recently is that now we have a fully functioning internet. With very high speeds.  But its possible the internet will be crippled or run at severely reduced speeds in the future, for brief moment of time. Its important that the basic layer of bitcoin still works under that condition otherwise we cant trust it to the same degree. Even if the internet is never crippled, its comforting to know that should it ever happen, bitcoin will still be able to work.

Its also not so much education as it is a convenience thing. Its convenient to have BTC ready to spend on certain sites, rather than calculating and sending excact amount every time.

That much is true. But i think the blocks can safely be larger than the current 1mb. Considering the best internet connections are in the west, the best data plans, etc. The increased bandwidth requirement as a result of larger blocks gives the west an edge over the 3rd world whose strength is cheap electricity.

Look at the hypocrisy. That gang of people first are like, core sucks, they are not good for bitcoin and proceeds to fork it. Then gavins keys to the distro are removed, and all of a sudden its like, omg why did you remove his keys to core, give them back to him, he needs it. Also on a side note, disagreement is not neccesarily bad. Im going off the title, since it seems to build on the assumption that disagreement is bad, and since there is disagreement to some degree, when it comes to the blocksize limit, the situation is bad. But its not. Its not bad at all. For example Steam accepting bitcoin seemed to go over the heads of most people. That is a huge fucking deal. You know that was what we dreamt of 2 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:00:39

@_date: 2016-05-24 12:21:14
The crypto nerds from core probably arent interested in the bitcoin foundation. I have a feeling it has to proove itself first. That seems to be their mentality. 
So what can the bitcoin foundation do to be an asset. I guess it could contact AntPool first and foremost and get them to not block SegWit. But i suspect thats no easy feat. Basically the bitcoin foundation has to bring the community together. Then maybe core will get behind it. Just my 50 cents. I am not affiliated with core or bitcoin foundation. So just ignore me.

bitcoin transaction rates may have plateued for now. thats why i linked the fee chart. because when blocks are full you measure demand on fees. and demand is increasing as you can see.
if there is going to be blocksize limit increase as well, the people that chose to only focus on number of transaction will be able to see the growth as well.

What made you release info in this particular case?  (Hopefully merely saying DAO attacker is not enough to make you release info). Remember the reddit witch hunt that happened when the Boston Attacks occured. Reddit "detectives" found a person and doxxed him and it went to the front page, and it turned out he was not the bomber.

I think the problem is they have no alternative. If bitcoin becomes more widespread it can become an alternative i guess. I actually think in a way the negative interest rates in the fiat system will become bitcoins killer app. Because anywhere you store fiat, there is going to be a fee, negative interest for storing it. Paypal, steam wallet, you name it. Either the service will deduct it from your balance or charge a fee another way. Bitcoin on the other hand does not cost to store, like fiat would, in the case of negative interest rates. So i think people will prefer bitcoin over fiat at some point. Of course the governments etc. will try to create demand for fiat, by maybe only accepting taxes in that. Who knows.

there are more and more bitcoin users tho. At least there are more and more tx. It will be interesting to see the development of the fee pressure, if blocks keep being full.

According to exchanges it would require replay protection. And depending on the new blocksize limit (I presume thats what you a referring to) youd need a fix for quadratic hashing. Youd also have to pick a number that everyone would agree on. Do you think its 2mb? I mean we are hardforking, so you can do anything you want, why no pick 8? Long story short you will never get consensus this year. Good luck.

i think a walet can make money maybe, by taking care of the fees for the user and skimming of the top.

They keep the difference i assume.

@_date: 2017-07-04 18:08:36
Its a funny arrangement that im not 100% i understand. But SegWit parks the signatures outside the old blocksize limit, so post segwit you can have more transactions per block. Then Schnorr comes  in and reduces the size of the signatures that are parked outside the old blocksize limit. So by shrinking the signatures that are already parked outside the old blocksize limit all you achive is reduced bandwidth it doesent really increase through put? Please correct me if im wrong.

@_date: 2017-07-15 12:23:03
1. raisng the blocksize is not scaling. when do people understand this?
2. core have been working extensively on improving the client and network to get it ready for bigger blocks.
3. they proposed a softfork last year which would double blocksize but miners have been slow to signal, so we cant use it yet.
4. last but not least core do not have control over what the network does or does not do.
tl;dr any educated person would not say core has blocked scaling

I dont think that can ever be the case. Someone can end up paying a higher premium to get his BTC exchanged, but there is always going to be a way. That being said, exchaning BTC will in theory be less and less important as bitcoin gains adoption, and more trade is done directly in bitcoin.

The thing is that if economic majority do not support BIP148 or any sha256 miners support it and it is faced with having to change PoW it will not have alot of hodlers or even exchanges supporting it since it will be the in beginning of its lifetime. But the coins will still be very rare and carry a hefty price tag i would argue and price could only go up from there since it will have SegWit AND a new PoW which is attractive to many.

You dont get economic problems from not controlling the money the supply. The market will chose the most stable and useful form of money in absence of government control. Therefor it does not matter for the economy, wether or not the government dictates whats to be used as money. In fact, the opposite is the case. When government creates a monopoly on money, enables central and fractional reserve banking, and artificial interest rates.. This is when the economy starts taking damage.

Which is true, but these larger and "more meaningful" transactions may not need to be on the blockchain either.

But i dont think we need to argue on Social Media. I dont think r/btc can affect bitcoin. I think the responsible thing to do is to propose SegWit, and if people dont like it. Well, too bad :)
And honestly before miners do anything they should consult Core. And i think they will. There is no reason for us to waste our time on reddit, unless we enjoy it. Bitcoin can handle the rejects :) And if it cant? Does it deserve to live then?

I think its important to decide right now, that the blocksize limit is not supposed to create or destroy a fee market. it should not be used for this. Thats not why it was implemented either, afaik. Its to conserve bandwith, and maintain a healthy network. If it is determined (how do you determine these things by the way?) that for example an 8mb block size limit is a better one, then the fees etc. must deal with that, they may increase ten fold or they may fall, that shouldnt influence what the blocksize limit is. But how do you determine what the correct block size is?
I think we need a methodology for this, more than anything else right now.

This is such a BS sentence. The regulators would never pass a law without consulting experts. They need to keep up an appearance. If they didnt the system would not work. It would be a farce. You dont engage with regulators until they come to you. because regardless of what you do or tell them, or how early you are, they will ruin things in the end. Another thing is, this team of MIT dudes, working on this, they have nothing to lose, except the funding for their research department. I never heard of a company being eager to get regulated. I never heard any of the people actually getting their hands dirty and doing the work wanting someone to tell them how to do it.

With offchain transactions and other 3rd party solutions the network already have infinite scale. satoshi created the bitcoins, and protected them with the blockchain, it has censorship resistant transaction system built in, but who really needs that. The problem is that paymnt systm is ineffecient, and once we realise the true cost, people are going to shy away from using blockchain to transact unless they absolutely have to. tl;dr the blocksize limit is not that important. As long as bitcoins integrity is protected, and it is protected with a blocksize limit of even 1mb.

Gold doesent need a built in transaction system. In fact the blockchain that occampanies bitcoin is ineffectiont as frick. The blockchain however makes sure bitcoins can be audited, etc. it creates the foundation for bitcoin to be used as a currency. TL;DR it doesent matter what the blocksize is, in theory, since we are not dependent on the blockchain to do bitcoin transactions (thank god.). Did that make sense?

The blockchain is not good for peer to peer cash because of its obvious limitations.  Such as blocksize, and average growth of the blockchain. Etc. Someone with a better technical understanding of payment systems, would probably be able to give a better explanation. But even as a person with no technical knowledge you should be able to see that the blockchain is not viable for a payment system, at least not a big one.

Mempool has 100k transactions, miner finds a block, includes all 100k. nodes who dont accept block that large are forked off the network. voila, network just became a little more centralized. (It is my belief that economic nodes will not be enforcing a blocksize because they cannot afford to be forked off the network, and they can also afford huge ass blocks and kind of have an incentive to. but it will become a tragedy of the commons and eventually blocks will be so large the network is in danger)
So EC in principle removes bitcoins trustlesness because you can no longer trust that blocks will be a certain max size and as a result of that the reliability of the network is worsened. Wth ec you will also create a need for human co-ordination. ie. miners co-ordinating blocksize. it will be like the federal reserve deciding interest rate and giving bailouts. Presumably *not* what satoshi had in mind when he/she created bitcoin.

Yes it does, for the reason i mentioned above. You cant even a provide a reason for your statement.. Repeating it does not make it true.


SegWit2x does not have consensus (Which is why i think until it does it wont be succesful) and it is succesful without consensus, then they will do more things without consensus in the future.

They can create a bunch of transactions themselves tho, so a 1mb block can be constructed, but that seems unproffesional. 
It turns out the rationale for chosing this method of replay protection was to ensure that SPV clients did not have to update. But this just means that SPV clients do not get replay protection. So what is the point?
Imo. this BTC1 ordeal is unsafe and its shocking to me how much of the hashrate supports it.

You are actually wrong. Anyone can  change the whitepaper, it's got nothing to do with rights, and you may chose to host any version of it you like, however if you are not hosting the original you shouldn't be giving the impression that it's the original. Last but not least if the protocol evolves why shouldn't the whitepaper hosted on bitcoin.org?
To answer my own question, I think the answer is the whitepaper is not that important. We have probably bigger fish to fry than worry about it. I'm thinking the wiki is good. Its easier to keep up to date while leaving the original paper in tact. Besides who is going to amend the paper? Who is going to approve it, and how long until it needs another revision? Just leave the paper alone, it's not a problem.

If you only solution is a blocksize limit of 2mb, its better to stay at the current 1mb. Its sleeker, and it spurs grows and thinking on actual scaling solutions. The problem with increasing the blocksize limit as we go, as a kick a can down the road solution, is people get into the wrong habits. If you think there is alot off noise and pressure to increase blocksize limit, imagine what it would be like, if full blocks werent introduced until another 2-3-4 years. Then companies and individuals would have built their buisness models and general affairs on free blockspace, and that would cause centralisation problems, because at that point no amount of warning would be able to stop the blocksize limit from being expanded again. And then you have a problem. This is just one of several arguments for why a 1mb blocksize limit is cool.

I dont agree. As blocks fill up fees are expected to rise. The current blocksize limit will likely be increased in future. But meanwhile bitcoin adoption could continue. The blocksize limit is not a cap on adoption, its an incentive to be frugal if anything. I think this is important to understand.

When you use segwit part of your transaction dont use the "old" blockspace. This makes more room for everyone else. In fact capacity is expected to double becuase of this change. I dont see what the problem is.
Also note that this change could have been made 6 months ago if the miners would signal. Now we are trying to take matters into our own hands with BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:15:50


No they are not. Because like i said, they can release software but they cannot control who runs it. How are you going to activate a hardfork? (I presume thats what you are talking about.)
Is Core just supposed to release a version and say, allright at blockheight x this version will fork. Who would run that? Or what did you have in mind?
*edit* Just admit that you know as well as Core that hardforks are not an easy thing to do. The only difference is you want Core to do it, so they can take the fall if it fails. Fucking hate slimy people like you.

Im guessing to the SEC if your exchange isnt properly regulated, it doesent exist to them. This includes the winkdex, and bitfinex possibly, who are in a grey area, which is why the COIN ETF may not be based on those, since the SEC has to approve it.

My understanding is we will never see full ie. 4,000,000 block weight blocks because the legacy limit will usually kick in first? 
Not sure what the average size of blocks will be in terms of weight post segwit, but when Schnorr gets added, the average size of blocks in terms of weight will simply shrink? There is no additional capacity?

It sort of does. If there is not an incentive to do what the masses want it wont be done. If the masses want something but there is no incentive to do it, it wont be done.
Compare it to democracy where politicians can promise the world because they dont have to pay for it themselves. Democracy is guided by masses. In bitcoin there are incentives that protects it against the masses so the masses are not strictly in charge.

Roger wants short term gain on his investment, that's it. He is not interested in the long term. This is why he wants to bump blocksize limit 1mb right now, because he is convinced the market will spike. But long term it doesent change a thing. Remember that Roger very went on YouTube to vouch for  mtgox when people was concerned it would collapse. And it did collapse. Again his thinking was short term. A mtgox collapse is bad, so he he will do what he can to keep the thing running a little longer. Including going on YouTube and saying he think's everything is fine. I am positive his poor judgement and lack of caution made the mtgox collapse worse.

There is some truth to this i think. The high fee pressure in may caused people to consume less blockspace. But i think this is the intended consequence of the fee-market. The market routes around on-chain payments except for critical payments that has to do on-chain payment (good news for these people that the high fee pressure scared away casual payments. ), but casual payment people did not necceserily stop holding bitcoins. Because store of value etc.

Im not sure i agree with this. And you can see bitcoin price going up alot in months following the halvings and even a few weeks prior in anticipation.

@_date: 2017-06-03 13:27:06
There is alot of demand to move bitcoin around, but miners can only do x amount of transactions per day. So the fees go up when there is more demand than supply. 
There is a fix for this, but for pretty much unknown reasons its being blocked. There is speculation that miners are blocking it delibarately to make more money.

I think another issue is "Whats the point". What is truly gained from hardforking to 2mb? In the grand scheme of things not much is gained. On top of that nobody knows how to do a hardfork. Do you just announce a flag day and then the chips may fall where they may? This is a big risk to take for a measly 2mb :) It seems like there should be a bigger reason to hardfork. Those are just my 50 cents.
PS. Before you ask "Why not hardfork to 8mb then",  well this is where scaling becomes hard :) 8mb may be too large.

Imo it is the miners that insist on not mining BIP148 that are splitting the chain.

Bitcoin is changing rapidly. These wallets will become obsolete fast. Even the ATM's around the world will become obsolete. Small purchases are less and less viable. You will have to get at least $1,000 worth or more otherwise to much of your coins go to the miners in fees.

You said it would be unfair. It was not clear you were playing devils advocate. 
What i dont understand is actual problem. When you use a word such as "complex" that sounds bad, but whats the alternative? Those use cases will move to another chain. Which could be use cases that actually help scale.
Last but not least, the discount actually makes it cheaper for everyone. Because if using SegWit which is lighter than a legacy transaction, that frees up space. So its good that the heavier transactions will leave less of a footprint. Makes more room for everyone else. Please correct me if im wrong.

It was known from the start that the way NYA attempts to activate segwit is incompatible with the way SegWit is currently rolled out. That could just be a mistake, and perhaps it is fixed. I will be happy to stand corrected.

In before Jihan, Armstrong and Ver commit to fork bitcoin. Jihan will do the mining, Armstrong will provide an exchange for the coins (poloniex will also adopt it asap) Ver.. I dont know what his role will be. Anyway, its going to be great. And its just one of these threats that makes me want to sell bitcoin right now, because from an investor perspective, things are not looking great tbh. Bitcoin will probably survive, but its not going to be cool to have money on the line while the incumpent aforementioned egos selfishly try to attack.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:06:54

@_date: 2017-06-26 15:45:56
Thank you for your response. The problem i have with rbtc is they make up their own truths and then they hold everyone else accountable to them. Ie. bitcoin needs to scale fast, and Core didnt scale bitcoin fast so Core is evil. But the truth is not necceserily that bitcoin needs to scale fast or that it can even scale fast (the network is decentralized, so it takes time to rollout a solution. The solution also takes time to develop and properly test etc.) So the whole premise of rbtc erodes. Anyway, thats enough reddit for me today. Have a nice day.

Bitcoins PoW is a security liability. 
1. Asicboost
2. Asics themselves are a problem.
GPU PoW is superior and there are MANY gpu miners who would switch to Btc if they had the chance. Not a concern.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:07:58


This narrative is being pushed by the miners who want to control bitcoin. Basically saying devs are evil. But it makes no sense why they want to control bitcoin. Without devs the coin will be terrible and not worth much.

@_date: 2017-06-16 15:54:00
How is it not obvious that Bitmain will eventually orchestrate a 51% attack? Do you think they will back down? They have become increasingly hostile over the years and they continue gaining hashrate marketshare. The only way this is going to end is when they strike and bitcoin changes PoW. We can limit the damage by alerting people in advance.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:36:03
How can you consider BIP148 an attack on bitcoin is beyond me.

The UASF is going to suceed. Even if it doesent have enough hashpower to generate blocks in a timely manner, they can just change PoW afaik. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:12:50
tbh. it makes more sense to move to second layers rather than other crypto's because other cryptos have same scaling problems, they may not be as honest about them tho (fast block time, no block size hard cap goes a long way misleading users but is not sustainable)
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:10:29
I think there are already forks of Core that are BIP148 ready. So i imagine its just a matter of switching to one of those and copy your wallet.dat to it and then you are good to go. Its also possible that Core will officialy support BIP148 in which case you dont have to do anything but update. However, consensus is still forming, so yea.

Maybe thats because there is no alternative. Not that that is a bad thing. SegWit is decent afaik.
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:45:54
Only reason a node will be "blind" to a softfork is if it doesent update. But what the is real harm there? However, if a node doesent update for a hardfork it will stay on a separate chain. Which do you think is more problematic?

Not sure what you point is. Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:57:49


Increasing the blocksize is excactly what SegWit does, and it has been available since last year. Miners are literally fucking everyone by not activating it.
Also i think you know this, so why do you come on here and spreading this misinformation? Do you just hope that noone corrects you and your shit sticks?

Well there is an element of dysfunctionality (is that even a word?) considering miners are not scaling bitcoin and dont seem to have any plans of doing so in the forseeable future. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:33:30
Also what is the cost of being able to "get the money back". First of all i can think of how removing consequences leads to a less robust system. I wonder what the costs associated with charge backs is. THe overhead required and so on. In the end, i dont think the system which has charge backs is superior to the one that does not. But im not sure.

Bitcoin may not die, but it will cease to be very interesting. The New York agreement is rushed and random (Why 2mb base blocksize? there is even confusion as to what it means, and how to activate it and what order). So if SegWit2mb frankenstein fork gets "ratified" bitcoin has a problem in that rushed and random forks can get adopted as far as i can tell.  Not something that belongs in bitcoin.

By the way I suggest every other miner joins. Majority of the network nodes is already ready for segwit, and those that are not will still be compatible.

This is hilarious. They act like BIP148 is malicious.
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:21:50
Some people argue that the NY agreement is not two cakes (They dont consider hardfoking for a 1mb bump to be a cake). In fact the NYA should not be considered cake at all because it likely wont activate.
1. You need to install "3rd party" software. That is, software that is not coming from the source you trust (Core.) So you have a problem there of getting people to run it
2. The activation "logic" is flawed, its not compatible with the current segwit rollout, and it still relies on miner signalling which has proven to not work.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:48:39
Nobody said it was. But if you are fine with $7 fees i guess we can just stay at 1mb.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:20:32
maybe. I mean it could retrace to sub $2000 and then accelerate up before year end to $10,000. I mean its anyones guess.

@_date: 2017-06-09 15:58:32
I have a feeling you are right. Things could get out of control later this year. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:29:51
Of course this changes the trust model. If they are succesfull what silly thing will they come up with next? 
Bitcoin is not about onboarding loads of users. Its about sound decentralized payments which is a niche market all things considered. I dont know why people are trying to cram as much shit into it as possible, it obviously dont scale. Do they think it will make them richer? Go invest in Ethereum then. They are pushing it to the limit. Pump and dump. But bitcoin should be the "fall-back" option (It will always remain no1 if it stays decentralized and trustless, regardless of what FUDsters say about on-chain fees). No reason to make it centralized etc... 
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:38:03
The mining centralization is already here. Thats why SegWit2x is a thing to begin with. They think they can use their hashpower to coerce the network into hardforking with them.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:02:08
It is completely voluntary wether the network run core software. Core could release a new software with a fork but there is no guarantee the network would adopt it. You act as if they are in control of bitcoin when they are not.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:45:25
why i am i not excited by this? i love segwit
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:46:23
With current signalling there will be 2 coins.
@_date: 2017-06-10 06:45:45
jgarzik is not particularly active on the repo. i see people like james hilliard and kekcoin taking more interest. which is interesting, because jgarzik is presumably being paid to specifically work with the repo while those other two individuals presumably are not. why is jgarzik not more active? and why is there seemingly no participation from companies and individuals that signed up for the repo? do you know what i mean?
the people who signed the agreement simply does so because they were lead to believe that if they sign it, their problems would go away. but of course this isnt the case, things are not that easy.
@_date: 2017-06-10 06:16:14
there is a possibility segwit2x wont succeed, so saying it will provide breathing room remains to be seen. segwit standalone practically cant fail if miners would signal and it does raise theoughput approx 2x. segwit2x can fail regardless of miner signalling as far as i can tell. so the actual emergency solution would be to activate segwit asap and work on more scaling from there on, instead of delaying it by trying to couple it with a hardfork as well.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:14:38
Technically its not a compromise unless Core merges SegWit2x.
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:37:26
If bitcoin doesent get LN and SegWit people will move to other coins that does.

If you dont generate an income in bitcoin i dont think its worth it yet. It seems like one would be going through alot of hoops just to make a statement. Convert fiat to bitcoin, then convert bitcoin back to fiat when you need to spend. Know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:09:49
I am just saying. If the consumer/prosumer banks start to charge negative interest, everyone will want to store their wealth in bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-11 18:58:53
That guy is contradicting himself
1. &gt; At the time of writing, one bitcoin is already worth over $2000, and it just keeps growing.
2. &gt; the current software enforces a trivial 3-4 TPS throughput and has maxed out the network at levels way below those necessary for continued growth. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:10:37
Yes i think it matters. Sharing your concern is important. Either someone will alleviate it, or you brought a new problem to light. Either way it seems helpful :) Those are just my 50 cents.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:56:25
There are hundreds of crypto currencies with different PoW and they dont have problems with miners.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:36:58

Do you not agree that blockchain is a bad match for consumer payments?
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:08:15
This is not true. Stop spreading this nonesense. Core devs proposed segwit last year which increases blocksize 100%. If the fork had been activated the fees  would not be so high as they are today.
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:26:32
2FA is a blessing and a curse. If its mandatory, prepare for customer support being overun with requests to disable and reset it, because they wipe their phone, or got a new one, or somehow lost their 2FA. On the flip side, you make it optional, but then queue the customer support "overrun" with people losing bitcoins because their account name and password fell into the wrong hands.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:04:55

Asset for saving. Its horrible for spending. Patiently waiting for paypal to adopt it, or a paypal equivalent for bitcoin to come forth.

So what do they need an imutable ledger for that for? What problems does that solve? Is it easy to fake you own property, is it hard to prove ownership? Can it be censored?
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:11:49
First of all SegWit is a blocksize limit increase. Second of all, many have tried before SegWit to raise blocksize limit, its not like there is a lack of proposals. So this doesent seem like its a problem with developers.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:13:25


Thats debatable. Truth of the matter is we dont know why miners are suddenly so eager to signal SegWit. Maybe UASF has something to do with it? UASF originated in the Core camp afaik


Until they realise they have to run new software and it will potentially be an alt-coin. I was told that alot of people who signed the NYA was not aware this was the case. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:06:51

The problem with 2x is its not based on reason and evidence. Its just SegWit2x, just because. If this is how bitcoin is supposed to evolve, i think you will find that the smart money will leave.

@_date: 2016-07-11 03:52:16
Im not sure how to answer this, but i will give a go anyway because its an interesting question.
First of all i would like to say that buisnesses do not have to grow to exist or to be succesful. As long as you buy food, clothes, housing, you name it, the economy will be fine. As a matter of fact, an economy with sound money, does not have to grow to avoid imploding. An economy that is built on fiat money, debt, etc. has to grow continunally so the debt and  the devaluation of the currency can be sustained. If the economy grows slower than the amount of debt piling up, and if an economy grows slower than the speed at which the money is being devalued, its in trouble. So thats an argument for sound money ala bitcoin, because the economy is much less stressed.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:49:41


Yes, this is true. And it will be great to have. But we will have that precedent sooner or later. We dont need to create it preemtively with a "measly" 2mb hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:34:02
miners do not seem to take interest in these things. they seem to just care about more PH and more blocks, thats it. Thats why we need UASF's and tbh. there probably has to be a split until miners wise up. There has to be some sort of negative consequence. Otherwise they will just continue herp derping like they do now.

bitcoin has been rallying since 2015
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:57:14
Thats even worse since thats the equivalent of a buisness cancelling subscriptions with users. The hardfork is a terrible decision and they *will* come to realise it sooner or later.

Even if the new york agreement fails, and the UASF fails, that is not proof that the UASF didnt work, because the new york agreement was giving the impression that the UASF was not neccesary so it stopped getting support. This is why i think the new york agreement is a stalling tactic and Jihan is going to fuck  everyone by backing out. But time will tell.

why does the politics even matter? if this agreement gets anywhere im done with bitcoin tbh.
the problem is that guys get together in a room and agree on a path forward for bitcoin, but none of these guys have the competence to make these kinds of decisions. and now you have jgarzik who is making frankenstein code just to try to live up with this silly agreement. If it activates it is the end of solid engineering basically.
the fact that they didnt decide to just activate segwit as its currently rolled out comes to show how incompetent they are. my goodness.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:24:32
this is based on the assumption that segwit2x locks in. if it dont, and core have merged bip148, what happens then?
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:24:56
It probably is. But next thing they are going to do is just hardfork to 8mb blocks. lul

I dont know if you are doing this to help the guy or just trying to sound smart. But telling someone new to not use wallets where he dont exclusively own the private keys does not help at all.

unfortunately there is no quality bar in segwit 2x, and i am also concerned about the activation day of segwit. it is highly problematic that a new implementation comes out of  nowhere and forks bitcoin.

What do you mean? :)
@_date: 2016-05-21 09:06:23
Not sure i share your concern. It should be possible for services as well as individuals using bitcoin to adapt. In theory they should be able to figure out how to not get transactions stuck by managing the fee correctly. It should also be possible to develop intelligent fee selection so that end users dont even have to think about it. This seems like a better and more decentralized approach compared to hardforking the protocol. Do you know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:06:19
That scenario also exist in inflationary economy. Its called a bad investment. A bad investment is a bad investment. It depends on how many costumers you are able to get, and how much they are willing to pay, and how big your expenses are etc. It doesent really have anything to do with wether money increases in value over time or not.
Besides if money is increasesing in value over time, buisnesses and individuals get wealthier not poorer by default, which means they have more money available for spending.
@_date: 2016-07-24 02:42:11
I dont agree with that. It is expected that the community will listen to and abide by reason and evidence. So the best thing you can do to influence the blocksize debate is provide reason and evidence (Why do you think the classic are getting nowhere?). It does not matter how big your buisness is or how much you bitcoin tbh. that comes second.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:01:03

There are some pretty epic buisness oppertunities in bitcoin depending on how you can navigate the regulatory environment. But off-chain transactions are going to be HUGE. There will be a paypal equivalent for bitcoins wether we like it or not. Of course you dont store all your coins with them.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:31:18
SegWit2x activates segwit so its tempting to support. But i think because they have bundled it with a bad hardfork as well its a no-go. Why miners pledge to support it idk.

The chinese have a good control on their government. The chinese government fear the chinese people. If they go against the wishes of the chinese, such as, banning bitcoin in the event it becomes too popular, there is going to be riot in the streets. In that case bitcoin will never be banned, if it really becomes dear to the chinese.
Bitcoin is a better version of gold. Its digital gold. Is email a better version of traditional mail? Yes, because its digital. 
Government is not going to do anything about bitcoin. Government, especially western ones, have their hands full. Growing dissent, economic uncertainty, etc. Bitcoin is just going to do its thing while the western governments in particular scramble to keep their house of cards together.

I would rather segwit not activated at all instead of this. But i am probably in the minority. Basically if SegWit should activate, it should be activated properly instead of with this frankenstein proposal :|
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:05:09
Imo it does have a centralizing effect because SegWit2x in itself is a less decentralized codebase with little to no code review, testers etc. So if it becomes the main repo, well that will have a centralizing effect on deving.
Second of all the blocksize increases within are pretty significant. More than 4mb afaik. Which has previously been determined unsafe and centralizing.
There is also the problem of precedence of bumping blocksize when blocks are full. It will create pressure for perpetual blocksize increases. Its just like when the government says "if you give us this power we will only use it once and then we will relinquish it." but they keep it, and they start using it for all sorts of things that was not intended to begin with.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:42:13
That is not what was agreed to. Recomending a hardfork to Bitcoin Core is different from Bitcoin Core releasing software that hardforks on a flag day. I hope you understand this otherwise you need to think a little more about things.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:08:52
We needed a blockchain to secure bitcoin and make sure it couldnt get controlled by anyone. But look at what bitmain is doing. I think they are closer than anyone, ever, in taking control of bitcoin and thus doing things that isnt sound. So, if blockchain cannot even help bitcoin, what can it help?
There's a possibility that everything works out, but the way things are going im not all that optimistic. Rant off.
*edit* Even if SegWit 2x succeds in activating segwit the way in which it was done was so retarded. If SeWit should be activated it should be done properly, either the way it was originally proposed or via BIP148. This SegWit2x frankenstein imo takes away from the integrity of bitcoin if it suceeds. Please correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:22:34
you can have approx 1500 tx per block, and each block pay out approx 14btc. so real cost of tx = 14 btc / 1500 = ~$27

I didnt mean it like that. I didnt mean vote some new guys into power. I meant let the system go bankrupt. And by that i actually mean statism. How many times must governments fail before people even dare to think about a stateless society? Its incredible the degree to which people get conditioned to some ideas. For example government, they dont even dare to think about a society without one. Thats because government and its afiliates does such a good job at conditioning people, that they still will want government even tho we have thousands of fucking years worth of failed ones.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:36:36


How do you know? Miners are not in hurry a to switch, and i imagine it wont be that easy for them? So there wont be signalling on release date. Besides, isnt there confusion as to how excactly they will activate segwit? Last i heard there was concerns the segwit part would partition the peer to peer network. Dunno if its fixed.
Now, regarding the hardfork, exchanges have said that they will not list hardforks as bitcoin, and they will not list it at all unless they have replay protection. So there is a possibility that even if the hardfork has 80% hashrate backing it, miners will get cold feet,  and jump ship when we get closer IF the consensus isnt there to call the hardfork bitcoin and replace the old chain.


From following the discussion i dont think that is the case.

I learned a bit more about it. Because Ethereum uses an accounts system instead of a UTXO one like bitcoin, transactions has to be processed in order, not by fees paid. This is why Exchanges  halt withdrawals when a backlog forms.

There is also a 4th option. Namely, none of the proposals lead to anything activating and we gonna be stuck on 1mb blocks for at least another year. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:11:00
If this happens, its not LN that fails. Right? It could be a run on a bitcoin Bank (these dont exist yet). But why would there be a sudden run on the banks?
This is another reason to keep the blocksize Limit tight for now. Its important that everyone understands there are scalability issues with bitcoin. This helps build the scaling Solutions and prevents everyone from building and relying upon the legacy tx type if you will, Leading to this type of scenario.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:52:48


If there was mocking i think that was inappropriate. But there is a chance that that Sergio's proposal was bad. Do you know what i mean?


Yes but they still failed to be open about it. Maybe its just not a priority, but that goes a long way of showing how they think bitcoin should work. Which is enough basis to be against their proposal. The irony is that they know their proposal requires support from the wider community, but they act as if it doesent and they can just get away with it. But time will tell.


Yes, thats good news. But there was an issue with the way it was supposed to be activated which was conflicting with the current rollout of segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:46:13

Thats bullshit. You will see.
First of all, if its about bringing the community together, why was it devised in private?
Second of all why did they chose to activate SegWit in a similar but different way that it is currently proposed? Just activate it as its proposed now. Increasing the complexity reduces chances of success.
Just wait and see when the software is released. It wont accomplish anything but keeping status quo and jihan will be laughing at everyone who supported it.
UASF BIP148 is the only way to actually ditch the 1mb blocksize limit and move on right now.

Because the miners all of a sudden is in a rush. SegWit has been available for signalling for half a year. It wasnt until the UASF became a thing that SegWit2x became a thing. Also notice that SegWit2x is not ready yet, miners are signalling intent to signal and activate SegWit2x. Obviously the UASF has caused them to get off their ass? Or whats your take on it?
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:08:46


Yes, and then they can blame core for the high fees after., which Roger constantly does.
