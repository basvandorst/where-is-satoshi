They probably don't have their servers NTP-ed up.

Isn't this fair enough? 
If the customer tips $100 with a credit card, the restaurant owner only gets $97 of that, since he has to pay $3 to the CC company.
If he would pass the whole $100 tip to the waitress then he would be $3 out of pocket.
This is why I always try to tip in cash.

That's completely normal and is the same on any betting site I have ever used.
A football match is 90 minutes. But once a tournament goes into the knock-out stages, you simply have to have a winner. So they go on to extra time and penalty kicks.
If you bet on the result of the match, it would only include normal time and not extra time.
For the knock out stages, there will be an extra option to bet on which is called something like "To Qualify".

The exchange rate is the mid price, you're hit by the spread between buy and sell. Then the bank probably takes an extra £25 for taking in foreign currency. Sounds about right.

He does mention 1btc per ounce of gold.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:50:40
Psychological thresholds are still important though, they make the headlines. People care.
"1 BTC = $1000"
"Dow = 20,000"
"1 BTC = 1 ounce of gold"
And an ounce of gold is not just an arbitrary unit, it's the unit that gold is universally measured in. When people talk about the price of gold, they mean the price of a troy ounce.  When people talk about the price of bitcoin, they mean the price of 1 Bitcoin. 
He then goes on about the similarities and differences between gold and bitcoin. So it makes some sense to compare them and to highlight when parity has been reached.
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:36:12
On top of that, he never shows that he actually received the bitcoin. All he got was ticket with transaction details.

I might be too early, but I just sent some satoshi over lightning to bitfinex and this works fine. The only problem is they get deposited as LNX tokens with no way to trade or withdraw with them yet. Hopefully that will change when they launch it properly.

@_date: 2018-04-06 08:06:53
Sounds to me that you got the understanding correct. There will need to be well-connected hubs with enough funds in their channels to make this work. The main thing here is that you still have full control over the funds locked up in the channel. And the routing fees should be a lot smaller than on-chain transactions.

It's because BFL is still shipping. And even if the BFL kit that people are now receiving will not be making ROI, they will still be making more coins than it costs on electricity to run them.

If they would own 90% of the hashrate (deployed distributed so no-one notices), didn't want to launch a 51% attack but just destroy bitcoin.
Shut that 90% off in one go just after the latest difficulty change,  leaving 10% of hashrate.
This would mean each block will now take ~100 minutes to solve and this would go on for 20 weeks until 2016 blocks are resolved.
Six confirmations will now take 10 hours (so pretty much a working day) and it will make it rather useless, not just annoying.
We're talking Fed here who will be quite happy to spend millions (of their own printed money) to cancel out a competitor and save their trillion $ pyramide scheme...

@_date: 2013-09-25 09:15:15
Yes, difficulty will fall eventually, but only after 2016 blocks have been mined. 
So if someone manages to increase the difficulty extremely high and then stops mining altogether, it means that the left over hashing rate will take a lot of time to mine those 2016 blocks. It will take a lot more than 10 minutes per block so transaction times will slow down as well.

I disagree. If he would not have bought the miner, he probably would not have invested all that money in BTC either. 
So he made his money back and is still mining so he is making a profit on his investment, and having the fun of mining at the same time.
Could he have made a better investment, of course. But that's all easy to say with hindsight.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:12:51
As long as the destination address is ok, you will be fine.
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:46:38
Yes, the reward will stay the same. 
But the 20 weeks of 'annoying bitcoin users' will see a large part of these users drop out and new adaptation will definitely slow down if not stop at all.
After the 20 weeks are finally over and the difficulty is down again, just start up your 90% of the miners again and within days you hit the high difficulty again.
The network will be too unstable and unpredictable to take serious.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:28:44
The idea is that transactions costs will increase over time and will become a much bigger part of the reward.
