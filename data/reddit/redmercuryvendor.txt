So, make some duplicate packaging and print some holograms (shiny square with TREZOR + logo on it, but all you can see on the site is the logo and the 'R'). Short-run card printing can be done in-country with assembly done by hand for small runs, and hologram stickers can be printed on-demand via Alibaba/Taobao shops. 
For the potential return, the cost of a small run of fake packages is trivial. Any non-unique anti-temper device is going to be fairly trivial to duplicate using the same readily available production equipment that you used to produce your packaging.

Helps not at all.
- Duplicate packaging, down to 'temper evident' seals. Even in small runs this is done as cheaply as you yourselves can have your packaging made for.
- Include new documentation that does not mention official site (or better yet, QR-links to false site with visually similar URL and same stylesheets)
- False documentation omits mention of need to install firmware (only a single bullet-point on the official site at the bottom of the page) so load a new firmware with a pre-set key or a phone-home function
Unless the purchaser has visited the set-up page **before** ever purchasing the Trazor, *and* has spotted that one bullet-point, then they are still vulnerable to doctored devices or counterfeits.

[BtRecover]( supports that wallet filetype (schildbach), I used it successfully to recover an old wallet recently from a 2013 version of Bitcoin Core.   
You can give it what you think is your passphrase and let it iterate on spelling/punctuation variants automatically, or create your own list of passphrases manually and feed it them to let it search through (I used Notepad++ to type out what I remembered my passphrase could be, and used the built-in editing and find/replace tools to create a 1000+ variants on phrasing and punctuation).
You *might* be able to use the technique shown on [walletrecoveryservice]( to create a 'safe' file for people to try decrypting along with your passphrase guesses, in order to set a 'decryption bounty' without giving away the wallet itself. 


'Brute force' breaking of the encryption is not possible with current computational resources. There is not enough CPU time on the planet to do so before the heat-death of the universe. Remembering your passphrase (or enough of the pasphrase to try variants) is the only chance.

Technically you could replace that with any system with dual-controlled signed vaults. You could even do it with fiat currency and a bank offering shared-control accounts (with or without the trustless capability) and still operate day-to-day transactions over the Lightning network. As long as the shared ledger has the same *properties* as the Bitcoin implementation (updateable only by both parties, closable by either party) it could be hosted by any system.

A limited number of transaction can fit into a single 1mb block. If there are a larger number of small transactions, or a small number of very large transactions (e.g. consolidating multiple addresses into one) there will be more transactions than can fit into a single block. In this event, transactions are prioritised in order of which pay the most to the miner (the miner can prioritise however they want, but it makes economic sense to receive the most in transaction fees as you can).   
As demand to send transactions grows, the more transactions are vying for the set amount of space, so the higher the fees get as people try and get to the top of the queue.


Yes. Either (1) demand for transactions reduces, and/or (2) transactions get smaller, and/or (3) the blocksize increases.
1 can occur if the current rate of transactions is anomalous (e.g. if due to deliberate transaction spam, or due to demand from speculators that will reduce if price stabilises).
2 can occur with technology upgrades like Segwit, or with layering extra networks 'on top of' Bitcoin like the Lightning network.
3 has been attempted with forks like Bitcoin Cash, but that was not adopted by enough miners to achieve consensus. It is possible that a later attempt that gained agreement among all miners before forking could succeed, but increasing blocksize has some technical drawbacks (increased size of the blockchain, increased blockchain growth rate, increased bandwidth usage).

For UK tax law, if you do not have a receipt for purchase of an asset which you later sell (for Capital Gains tax purposes), you use its Market Value at the time of purchase. US tax law may have a similar provision.

On it's own right now, it's about as useful for day-to-day usage as SWIFT is for day-to-day payments. But SWIFT still moves massive volumes of currency during clearance because it IS good for doing that. I see Bitcoin operating in a similar capacity, unless the blocksize issue is sorted (and getting everyone to agree on that is like herding cats, as seen with all previous attempts).   
Lightning is one option for a day-to-day network tied to BTC for clearance, but there is potential for others. Or just for Visa/Mastercard to go 'fuck it' and layer EMV over Bitcoin. That would knock everything into a cocked hat. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:31:40
It only tells you the average. If there are a handfull of huge transactions taking up a large portion of the block and a large number of small transactions then the average will be pushed up enormously.

It could more functionally eliminate advert-support for browsing than previous schemes. Sub-cent transactions currently only work when bundled en-mass, which prevents direct pay-per-view and instead needs intermediary 'subscriptions' or similar to bundle both on the sending end (you need to make multiple visits to multiple sites with the same provider) and receiving (many people must visit your site) to function, and you generally need kilounit bundles to make it worthwhile once transaction fees and overhead is taken into account. Direct payment with proportional transaction fees removes this issue, and only works with an underlying currency that is sufficiently divisible.

It's a decent analogy: LN is to BTC as EMV is to ACH/SWIFT.

The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is an inherent part of how the blockchain operates. Every time you make a transaction with anyone who can identify you, regardless of who it is, that links your identity with the transaction chain. Likewise with transmitting your transaction to the blockchain (you're either doing it through Tor using a burner VM of Tails, or you're not doing it anonymously). If anything, passing your transaction through a large pool such as Coinbase makes it *more* difficult to match inputs to outputs than with a 'mixer' where the transaction swap chain can be unwravelled (as it is all public). Remember, P2P exchanges are inherently public transactions.

The US lacks Local Loop Unbundling (even Title II omitted LLU) so unlike with many other nations, to compete with an incumbent ISP you need to duplicated infrastructure and lay all your own last-mile cabling. That costs a **LOT**. It costs enough that *Google* gave up on their fibre rollout plans.
The last-mile ISPs are the big problem, so unless you can spend the billions to trillions to roll out a whole new national infrastructure, this isn't a feasible plan. If you want to spend millions, a better plan would be to counter-lobby to enforce Title II again, AND enforce LLU.

It'd be treated exactly how BTC vs. BHC is treated now, and how all other forks (e.g. Bitcoin Gold) are: the one which the majority of miners choose is Bitcoin, the one that is not chosen is the offshoot. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:32:03
The "larger blocksizes will cause centralisation" argument never made much sense to me: mining is **already** centralised to those who can afford ASIC miners that are perf/watt efficient enough to make a profit (vs. local electricity prices), which in practice limits mining to those who can afford the up-front cost of those ASIC miners. An increase in blocksize is not going to affect that: the blockchain gets bigger faster, but it's already ~150GB already and HDD storage is cheap (~[$0.02/gb]( If you can afford the $1500 (or with current supply issues, $2000-$3000) for an ASIC miner, then you can afford the $100 for a 4TB HDD to deal with larger blocks (and that can be shared between all miners, because you only need one shared copy).
The logistical issue of *changing* blocksize is another matter entirely, and has the same problems as implementing Segwit or any other change that requires everyone to agree to upgrade to the same version. That's where overlay networks like Lightning have an advantage.

But they aren't, it's P2P. Torrents laugh at a mere 8MB filesize, and operate perfectly well with terabyte filesizes, and that's with much smaller pools of seeds (for the Blockchain, the goal of every node is to both be a seed, and continue to be a seed for as long as possible. Being a leech is a temporary condition to avoid). Bandwidth is a complete nonissue.

 [...] we don't even know how much silver/gold is out there. And we can just mine billions of more ounces on asteroids, moon, which would increase the supply 100000x

Still better than doing a SWIFT transaction and waiting a few *days* for funds to turn up.   
At around 600bytes/transaction and 200 Satoshi/byte (for [approx max 420min confirmation]( that's &lt;€20 for any transaction completed within 7 hours, vs. the same for SWIFT within 2-5 business days.

Launch is going to be the big issue. While there are plenty of lower-cost smallsat launchers for low numbers of cubesats in the works (e.g. Rocketlab's Electron) getting something to the Moon and landing it without a hypervelocity impact takes both a large delta-V to start with (not really achievable with a smallsat lancher designed for LEO insertion), AND requires a satellite bus with its own on-board Guidance, Nav and Propulsion, and sufficient delta-V to at least decelerate to survivable impact velocities if not land outright (you now need to add a descent bus if you want to do that).
Best bet is probably to rideshare with an X-prize team or some other payload that is already heading to the lunar surface.

If you declare accurate BTC transaction amounts, they could potentially track them in the blockchain like any other transaction. Remember, any BTC movement is public and at best psuedonymous, NOT anonymous. Whether they would bother to do so would depend on whether you are audited and whether you were trying to fiddle capital gains calculations.

PoC attack:
- Monitor mempool for transaction
- Reverse privkey from pubkey
- Use pubkey to sign transaction from same source but with your wallet as destination, and with a higher transaction fee
- Rebroadcast new transaction
- Higher fee transaction given higher priority for inclusion in next block
- Variant: flood with transactions of just slightly lower fee to 'push out' original transaction
- Variant: perform attack on every incoming transaction to DOS entire blockchain

Did pretty much exactly the same thing recently:
- Back up the wallet.dat file in that old folder. Make several backups.
- Install the latest version of Bitcoin Core
- Start Bitcoin Core, then close it
- Copy the old wallet.dat and overwrite the version in %appdata%/Bitcoin
- Start Bitcoin Core
- It will be trying to download the entire Blockchain, but this is not necessary. Wait until it reaches 2013 and your transactions receiving the coins show up.
- Right-click on each transaction, and choose 'copy address'. Make a list of the addresses that you have received bitcoins to (may be one, may be several)
- Go to 'help', 'debug window', and choose the 'console' tab
- For each address, enter "dumpprivkey [address]" (without quotes or square brackets)
If the wallet has no passphrase, you now have the private key for each address. You can now use this key to 'sweep' the coins into a new wallet, e.g. Electrum. This moves all the coins into a new address, consolidating them with fresh private keys. 
If you DO have a passphrase, you better hope you can remember it. Before using the dumpprivkey command(s), you will need to enter "walletpassphrase [passphrase] 600" (without the quates or square brackets. 600 means it unlocks for 600 seconds / 10 minutes, then relocks again). 
If you can't remember your passphrase *at all*, then too bad, those coins are gone forever. If you can remember part of it, or remember multiple things it *could* be, then you will want to follow the instructions to use [btcrecover](

The problem with dynamic blocksize scaling is, unlike with Difficulty (where people will always want to *add* hashing power but there is very little reason to ever *remove* hashing power. You sell your miner and someone else buys it and reconnects it again) blocksize would need to scale with *demand*, which does not always increase.

It sounds like Lightning is a completely different payment method, that just happens to use Bitcoin as it's 'end-of-day' clearinghouse payment processor (same as EMV is used for day-to-day payments, settled by CHAPS/SWIFT at a later date). The 'end of day' not being a fixed point in time, but a fixed transaction amount created when that chain link was broadcast.

I went and read the [BIP70 proposal]( and it doesn't operate in the way OP claims. For one thing, the **wallet** broadcasts the transaction to the network, not the merchant. 
The merchant does not know the wallet address until the transaction is broadcast, and the transaction is not broadcast until the Merchant Server has sent the PaymentRequest, and once you have the PaymentRequest you can sign and transmit a transaction. There is no mechanism to 'blacklist' an address, as the address is not known until the transaction is already valid. At best BIP70 can be used to refund a payment, but that can also be done without BIP70.
