Coinbase is manipulating the market purposefully this should not go unpunished by the users they manipulated dump coinbase! I have divested 90% from coinbase to XRB! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:47:15
Move on from the manipulation to XRB I am over having my financial security taken hostage by some people who are far wealthier than me Raiblocks (XRB) has no mining to disrupt has no fees for transactions and is scalable with a tested 7000 transactions a second. Also went completely undisturbed during the BCC attack on Crypto

coinbase is the worst how dare they do this!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:45
im not sure this continues to be an issue i see leaving mining behind and using currencies like XRB (raiblocks) as the solution FREE transactions and scalability a tested 7000 per second transfer system
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:06
good choices! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:13
nah its fine check out XRB haha I've made a fair bit already and it isn't even on a major exchange I'm in awe I've been doing crypto for a several years but nothing has gotten me excited like XRB!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:42
XRB was unaffected by this maneuver for it doesn't use mining!

yas haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:58
of course its been very profitable for me !
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:32
ya im a fan of it what are your thoughts on it Mr. Veteran ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:49
fan of the no coinbase sentiment but XRP is centralized and I'm not a fan XRB (raiblocks) is my choice
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:33
Switch to XRB this would solve the fees, transactions issues and manipulation miners can have on the network give XRB Raiblocks a look!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:43
I HATE coinbase!

To reduce this volatility and blatant manipulation by exchange, miners, and whales we need to move to a currency more robust to deal with these kinds of manipulations and also is more scalable. XRB fits that mold and its here now with FREE transactions, a tested 7000 transactions per second (scalability), decentralized, low energy consumption, harder to manipulate due to not having mining, and its low market cap you can still get in on it! Check out  to get XRB in ur portfolio

We need a new currency XRB (raiblocks) has a lot less manipulation due to not having to be mined and a 7000 transaction rate lets get out of this bs BTC/BCC war

mining is such an issue... 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:28:12
sounds logical enough.
