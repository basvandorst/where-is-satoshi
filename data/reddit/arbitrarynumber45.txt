Where all these people that are adopting Bitcoin and spending it? Have they tripled in the last month? Or have the number of investors tripled?

I'm not sure what you mean by this, are you referring to their share prices? Twitter only just got floated, and Facebook's have gone from $38, to 25, and is now about $50 over the course of 18 months. Google's have seen a very strong, stable, gradual increase over the course of 8 years. None of them have seen massive exponential growth like we're seeing with Bitcoin.

I don't even know if it being widely adopted would cause it to stabilize. But it's not going to be widely adopted until it is stable, because people will try it once, lose money and think "no chance I'm doing that again".

The difference is nobody was signing up to facebook in order to make money from even more people signing up. Massive numbers of people are buying bitcoins to do that. It's not organic growth.

This doesn't assume they'd be forced -- they'd make the choice to accept it instead of another method, like you'd choose PayPal over a cheque. And then after the value drops from $100 to $70, they'd never make that choice again.

This is my point, they won't accept these risks and hence it won't reach a point where it's stable.

I don't see how the comparison between the value of a bitcoin and the rate of adoption of social media is a meaningful comparison?
