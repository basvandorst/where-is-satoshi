Most people can't hold an asset for 30 years without touching it, and I suspect we both know people that have spent a decade in negative equity with thier house. The opportunity cost here is huge.

Well, the developed world is ageing. Perhaps technology will drag us out of the demographic hole but I suspect that is going to bring it's own problems.
In the UK, I can't really see a way out of the current long term issues in our economy.

"This time is different"
Bubbles, whether it be in financial markets or commodities or property are absolutely fascinating to me.
The people who sell out of them early make money, less money than those that hang on, but more than those who hang on too long. Massive over simplification. 
The important thing is to have an understanding of what a good risk adjusted return is. 
Everything in moderation as the saying goes, which is why I am not as wealthy as friends who have taken bigger risks than me, but I also haven't had to sell the family home to cover a poor investment decision.
As I said, best of luck, but selling part of your pot when there are sudden gains in what is a very volatile asset seems sensible to me.

I am not the guy saying you will get straight up banned for doing anything.
I disagree that they "hate" BTC and think that what they have is a pragmatic approach to dealing with high risk strategies of handling your personal finances.
For most of thier members and the people they help, buying BTC is reckless. What most of thier members and visitors need to do is put in place basic  budgeting and money management, not speculate.
The danger is that vulnerable people who have gotten themselves into debt or are living one paycheck to the next go to the sub and come away thinking that putting money they can't afford to risk into BTC will solve their problems. I completely understand that they will discourage people advising to buy BTC from doing so in that sub. 
Most of the people who seek advice there have basic money management problems and getting them to buy BTC is like handing a todler a hand grenade.

So, taking real returns into account, risk weighting and opportunity cost, do you think someone who bought stocks right before the bubble burst and decided to hold until today's date thinks thier position is "fine"?

Ah, well debt is the elephant in the room.
Worst case that particular bubble doesn't so much pop as detonate. In that event I would rather own good farmland than BTC!

It's not that they don't understand bitcoin. The guys in do  understand it, and that is precisely why they don't agree with people recommending putting money into BTC.
Buying BTC in large amounts as a speculative investment is pretty much the antithesis of what thier sub is all about.
You would get the same response from them if you started pushing trading forex and futures on commodities.

You do all know what a bubble is, right?
Give some serious thought to liquidating some of your positions and take some profits now.
Best of luck.
