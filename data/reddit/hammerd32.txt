I got interested in bitcoin about 3 months ago and buy every week. So your statement is incorrect 
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:37:18
How dry is the interviewer.. luckily she has a bubbly personality otherwise that would have been horrible
@_date: 2018-10-28 22:17:54
I purchase once a week
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:36:37
There is no right or wrong just public consensus. 83% says sats so we use sats.

Wrong I came in a few months after January and buy every week. You start off with a incorrect assumption then expand on it.

Yes people should diversify

So if I give a 100$ note as a gift for a birthday. Is it worth 0$?
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:57:33
Down 50% from ath? You’re cherry picking numbers now. Why not choose since inception or any other random point?
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:34:29
Literally or not really literally? What did it first sell for?
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:24:04
Worth is what someone pays for it. No sale happened at 0$ so it was never worth 0$
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:43:56
Agree to disagree. Good night mate
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:26:31
A gift does not determine worth.
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:15:18
Who bought bitcoin for 0$?
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:38:48
So the value was the cost of the electricity

The problem was not the lack of regulation. These fucks were protected by the majority government after voting against a royal commission 26 fucking times. Our watchdog had all teeth removed. Funding cut so they could never enforce regulation.
Fucking dogs have been protected by the liberal party for a long time. I hope these cunts end up in jail and at least a generation of bankers live in fear of fucking everyone over with the recourse being jail.
They actually fucked the royal commission as hard as they could. One person only allowed to work for exactly one year. Strict guidelines on what he was allowed to investigate. The findings are literally scratching the surface of a fucking corrupted system

Maybe talking to me “is not for you” as you eloquently put it
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:08:53
Cool story bro
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:54:58
I read most of them. Your upset because people are “delusional”. Some are. The majority just have different coping mechanisms. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:50:37
So you want people to behave exactly how you want them to? People respond to loss in different ways. I have a drink with mates and laugh at the massive red number on my delta app. Recently it’s been laughing about the big red numbers on equities. Shit happens
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:08:47
Someone is butt hurt from recent events

You don’t get to decide who Bitcoin is for. It’s for everyone and if you don’t know that then you don’t understand bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:06:13
Bitcoin reddit. Bitcoin daily discussion. Topic made about actions of bitcoin investors..
Yeah I’m the one that’s wrong making the massive leap to the assumption we were talking about bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:12:14
Yay I’m the 0.01%
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:01:26
So what bugs did you find while using it? I don’t see the answer
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:46:06
Or invest a calculated amount based on your appetite for risk
