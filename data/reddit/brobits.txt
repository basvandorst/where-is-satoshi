Blockstream is single handedly responsible for the BCH fork in August. I’m not debating block size, but their resistance and censorship caused the community to splinter, this is common knowledge. 
I wholeheartedly agree with your first statement. Im disappointed that you don’t see the exact same company control issues with blockstream. No company should employ so many developers of a “decentralized” project. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:43:41
I trade in whatever coin makes the most sense.  ethereum for example handles an order of magnitude more transactions than bitcoin, for a fee an order of magnitude _lower_, scaling on-chain.
moore's law is working out fantastically, if you don't hamstring yourself with the block size.

I was with you as a rational actor until I got here.  This is simultaneously inappropriate and a misguided presumption.
You are so brazen to pedantically defend a 50 year old observation only to make an obviously trivial assumption?  I'm disappointed.
Moore's Law as an observation has not changed. Moore's law as a leading indicator for market &amp; industry guidance _must_ adopt for the markets and industries which use it as a guide.

this is not true. [we are decelerating, but have not hit any physical limits on Moore's Law yet](


we have adjusted the exponential scaling, but Moore's Law still scales exponentially.  hitting a physical limit would reduce from a polynomial to a linear or constant relation.  if we run into an atomic issue with respect to transistors, we will innovate technology in another fashion. the law is not limited to transistor speeds or CPU clock cycles, these are just our best measurements and understandings today.

this is funny, I have worked in both industries you mention (critical RTOS defense software and financial software).  In defense I worked with digital military cockpit maps, and I currently still work in finance building matching engines and integrating cryptocurrencies into the broader financial world. 
 I'm familiar with both classifications of requirements, and they are very different.


you know what's the same across these industries? the general engineering process.  small companies are quick &amp; dirty but tend to write unreliable software.  larger companies tend to write more robust software but their processes take much longer.
how do you buck the trend? in BOTH cases there was honestly only one thing that determined the reliability of the software, and it wasn't the requirement.  if the software had good tests, it was reliable.
anyone that doesn't bother writing tests shouldn't bother speaking on software reliability.

none of the block size suppression FUD, miner centralization FUD, network never being like VISA on-chain FUD is a problem today or in the near future.  it's all exactly that: FUD to suppress the actual capability of the technology _today_ to seize the coin's market _tomorrow_.  faster processors have very little to do with this today or in the near future.  the most obvious technical metrics to theorize scaling today are hard drive size and bandwidth, both of which are dirt cheap.  it's very sad.

the whole concept of an "altcoin" is kind of dead nowadays.  when every coin tried to solve a similar problem, they were alternatives.  most of the top coins are in different problem spaces, kind of eliminating the concept of 'altcoins'.  it's mostly a narrative to drive pro-BTC market sentiment nowadays.


this depends on merchant acceptance, but I would be very skeptical that anything beyond something like BTC/BCH/ETH/XMR will be accepted directly as currency by an overwhelming majority of vendors. even XMR will be tough for compliant vendors due to KYC/AML issues. my short answer is "no".
investing in ICOs (majority of ICOs are ERC20 tokens on the ethereum chain) is mostly a highly speculative play to make money.  I would stay away from ICOs for the most part, but maybe invest a small amount into a project you believe in

You can be done, but I’m still not missing the point. I will prove it. You said:


I argued that Coinbase $300 fees are in line with their brokering business with respect to the best purchase fee you can possibly get on a competitor exchange. This is common sense that Coinbase is not “fucking their customers with fees”, which is one of the two arguments you gave.
I’ve very directly disputed one of your claims, but you think I’m missing the point. “Everyone else” doesn’t “get” it, and even if “they” did, you cannot speak for an anonymous majority.

oh wow.  a few pieces of advice, which you may already know, if you don't mind:
- use continuous integration if you aren't already. you can set one of these (like jenkins or bamboo) up for free on an ec2 micro instance, they don't build often--only when you push a change
- obviously build &amp; run your tests in CI
- please don't be tempted to deploy to production directly from your dev box.  at least take CI output and deploy those artifacts. they were built in a clean &amp; tightly controlled environment
- more interfaces, so you can write more unit tests
and when you start to hire devs:
- adopt a PR model if you haven't already. all changes must be submitted in PR with passing test CI builder before acceptance

not sure why, I have zero posts in my history like that.
you are welcome to be however upset as you'd like for high fees.  [their fee structure is very clearly explained]( which is easy to find on google, that's how I found it.  it all depends on your region (due to regional laws and regulations) and your payment method.  if you get upset over ignorance, that's your own problem.  if you get upset after looking into it, that's fine too, just use another service.
looking at their fee structures, they don't seem ridiculous.  their fees are a little high, but nothing unreasonable. they are also the most compliant in a regulatory sense, which gives customers more trust with increased cost.  they bank with US banks and run a risky business, I'm not surprised they have a high fee business.

I should have been more specific, finance is a broad field. Which company do you work for? If you work for a bank, you could have clueless customers and still would have technology staging environments. If you’re an investment manager, custodian, or anything of the like, the point is moot.
Why are you arguing the merits of an integration staging environment if you don’t work in technology? You don’t work for a bank, a broker, a hedge fund, a trading firm, an exchange. All of these businesses will have similar technical setups with respect to integrity and software validation. What do you do in finance? Answer grandmas calls to click buy her google stock? Shit, even then you’d have an integration environment.

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:59:17
honestly not that I know of, but I'm sure they exist. I was taught computer science in school, not software engineering, which has more process.
generally you want good unit test coverage, an acceptance test suite that clearly defines business requirements and acts as a full integration test, and at least one staging environments.
on environments:
- at a minimum you will have production and staging
- staging is primarily used to 'test' deploying code, to make sure the process will work for production.  different changes generally drive different deployment configurations, so it's helpful to test every deployment
- it's nice to give customers a demonstration or simulation environment for _them_ to test integrations with _you_ before they go into production
- sim/demo _can be_ staging, but it's highly recommended to separate them.  this way you're not constantly changing the sim/demo deployment or system version, which may break customer integrations while they test.  frustrating customers is very bad
- it's nice to have a dev/test environment for _developers_ to play around with integrating pieces, without screwing anyone else up. devs tend to try wild things on a whim, which is good as long as it's isolated
- consider an environment a slice in your stack. every layer will also need to be duplicated.  this includes databases, http servers, mail servers, static assets, etc.
- unit test everything you can, they're the easiest tests to write. the more interfaces you use rather than direct object references, the easier it is to mock unit test your pieces
- you want a continuous integration environment to build every submitted change and run all the unit &amp; acceptance/integration tests against.  it's 100% okay to have the CI environment deploy to test/dev/staging if a build passes all tests
you should never deploy directly from a developer machine to production: even having such direct access rights to production is generally an issue. good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:30:30
In general? Probably. In finance? Absolutely not. Every financial firm—from the big banks to the tiny funds, shit even 2 man trading teams—constantly test in a staging or simulated environment. Bitcoin is finance. Lacking a staging/sim/testnet for a crypto company is amateur time. It is the industry standard.

how do you think ratios work? you have to divide to create a ratio.  let's explore, assuming BTC has no value:
BTC/USD ratio (how much BTC per USD): 0/1 = 0
USD/BTC ratio (how much USD per BTC): 1/0 = undefined
You can say 1 USD is worth 0 BTC, which would define the BTC/USD ratio as 0.  You cannot say that 1 BTC is worth 0 USD, because the ratio is undefined: 1/0 = undefined.  This argument is not appropriately framed as a trader, but instead as a mathematician.  The assumption here is that we assign "worth", or value, in USD.  If something has value, it has an associated USD price.
"$450 USD to 1 XBT" is not a ratio, it is a phrase.  The representative ratio would be XBT/USD (which "to" implies, where "per" would imply the inverse) or 1/450=0.002.  The ratios I've shown above are the representative ratios in the scenario where XBT=0.
I should note that we are discussing a scenario that would be very difficult to ever exist.  You can only say XBT has no value if everyone refuses to buy or sell it.  If any person buys or sells a fraction of XBT, it has been assigned a value, and will then have a corresponding exchange rate or valuation ratio

well, I don't get it. he seems to understand bitcoin well enough that he knows there is value to using bitcoin, using the phrase "very effective way of transmitting money" and mentioning anonymity. then, he turns around and says assigning value to bitcoin, because it's just a money transfer, is a joke. so, he gets it, but he doesn't get it?

I think the check being an entry into the blockchain is a much better analogy
@_date: 2014-04-03 20:21:43


in order to determine this, we must find the value ratio between the two. but, you knew this:


this doesn't really make sense by itself; this must be either XBT/seashells or seashells/XBT.  let's use XBT/seashells. In this example, assume XBT has value, and sea shells do not.  you define the ratio of value to be 0:
**XBT/seashells = 0**
We *know* XBT has value.  We also *know* seashells have 0 value, we assumed these things when structuring this scenario:
**XBT/0 = 0**
This is not true, and can never be true.  You cannot divide something by a number and arrive at zero, for the same reason dividing by zero is undefined.  It is impossible.


True, and they *used* to have exchange rates (value ratios).  Now they are no longer used, and no longer have defined exchange rates.  I understand it's not intuitive

I really don't think he's trying to play down his success. he's just saying Buffet might not be as quick to adapt to some new technologies as someone more tech-oriented, which is a valid assertion. I doubt Buffet understands the protocol behind bitcoin, blockchains, transaction malleability, etc.  Which is the reason he's decided not to attempt to value bitcoin, which is the reason he's advising against investing in it.

technically, if your fiat value becomes zero, you cannot value it against something with a nonzero value. the comparison is undefined, as you cannot divide by zero

While I don't disagree how unprecedented many of these events are (almost everything in Bitcoin is unprecedented?), this is a cop out.  You chose to operate an unregulated market.  You _explicitly chose_ to not have similar security controls as regulated exchanges; you guys made your own bed, and you complain when your users suggest you lie in it.


You did not give customers a choice to fully redeem their accounts at nominal value immediately.  You took their money and issued a new, unregulated derivative, which you just created, without their consent.  This would _never_ happen in a regulated market, and for good reason.  It's theft by financial engineering, plain and simple.  Do not lie and say you gave users a choice.  The ethical move would have been to borrow the money _you lost_ from a banking institution to make your users whole.  Your users are not a bank.

I understand this.  the customer is selling the coin, but the vendor facilitates the sale.  more vendor adoption implies more facilitation of sales, which implies more downward pressure


you make a fatal assumption here in that all (or even most) customers want to hold BTC.  _here on this sub_ most of us certainly want to hold BTC, and we imagine ourselves as the target of these retailers' changes.  this is not true.  we are early adopters; retailers are not updating their sales systems to account for our minority community, but are preempting widespread adoption of bitcoin.  retailers are targeting the common consumer, which does not currently hold bitcoin, and I don't think it's fair to assume they will want to hold for the sake of speculation

so let's talk about large retailers adopting bitcoin.  doesn't this just increase sell pressure when they accept payment and convert back to fiat?
the best way for bitcoin's price to rise is with more buy pressure on the coin, more people spending fiat to obtain bitcoins.  besides speculation, what keeps the price up when vendors accept bitcoin for payment?

no. if bitcoin wants to become mainstream we need to get more _people_ on board.


this is absolutely not relevant. who cares?


the gender of a CEO is absolutely not relevant for anything besides health insurance.  look, bitcoin has _never_ been about gender.  bitcoin hasn't ever been about anything besides technology and economics, with a dash of political ideology.  absolutely nothing to do with men or women.
if you want to promote gender diversity in bitcoin, that should be done by a lobbyist, advocacy group, or interest group like [Coin Center]( not a hardware company.
@_date: 2015-11-23 23:05:17


I don't think it's fair to refute it.  it's pretty common in the financial industry to have very high barriers to entry.  accepting money for anything besides a sale or non-financial service immediately renders you liable for money transmitter licenses which are extremely cost-prohibitive, for example

@_date: 2015-11-24 20:37:01


honestly, I think this is a sexist approach.  I would posit this has less to do with technical or intellectual capacity and more to do with social structures.


you guys are really missing the point here.  bitcoin has _nothing to do with gender_.  **bitcoin is nothing more than a technical means to achieve economic goals**.
that isn't to say you can't _use_ bitcoin to do other things, like empower underprivileged persons or underserved markets, which it does do today.  but saying that bitcoin is anything more than a financial technology is not only factually false, but also discredits the technology when you try to attach other ideologies or motives.

what does the tx size of an altcoin matter?  doesn't matter if the transaction size is 10GB: if the coin transfer is faster and cheaper than bitcoin, who cares how much data was moved?
of course this impacts future scalability, but _today_ altcoins--100b or 100kb tx sizes, doesn't matter--are more effective at moving wealth faster, and cheaper, than bitcoin.  period.  altcoins will continue to improve, and technical improvements are likely to eclipse bitcoin.  almost every altcoin in existence has a faster and more reliable development cycle than bitcoin has had for the past 2 years.

everyone's welcome to their own opinions.  I have set up a few mx servers on linux over the years and it's always a pain in the ass getting integrations right.  the most challenging aspect today is that private mail servers are prone to getting blocked by large providers (like gmail).  if you aren't in your recipient's contacts or fully compliant with TLS and their anti spam headers, your recipients will see your mail in their spam box, and all mail from your domain is flagged as spam.
[it's a common problem]( for people who do not send out a large volume of email, or register as large-volume mail accounts.
FWIW, the NSA only has backdoor access to US providers.  [proton mail]( is probably the best solution to avoid the NSA with a free account.
*edit* the software security professional in me suggests you are an order of magnitude more likely to misconfigure your personal, private mail server and expose a security vulnerability than the likelihood of being targeted by the NSA.  keep in mind, those security vulnerabilities expose you to a stronger attack vector to blackhats than using gmail does.  tl;dr: you are making it easier for non-NSA hackers to access your private email. I hope you don't have any crypto private keys anywhere in your mail history.

bitcoin is not the one coin to rule them all.  you don't need to pick _one_ blockchain to handle all monetary transactions. that's inherently centralized; spreading load over altcoins is both more decentralized and a reasonable scaling approach.
bitcoin cannot handle the load today due to poor (greedy) choices by the core team.  
altcoins _can_ collectively handle today's tx load, easily.  that's part of the reason bitcoin is losing so much market share right now.  
we have [some]( great [projects]( on the [horizon]( which can process 500k tps by design.  bitcoin is choosing not to be the dominant player in the future. the core team is making a huge gambit with everyone's investments into btc.  you can bark and cry about altcoin bullshit, but you sit in an echo chamber.
