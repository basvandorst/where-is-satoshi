I've had some money stuck on there for a while. Can't upgrade my status, even though I did with other card services using the same documents. They also don't list the max clearly so I loaded too much when I was new to all of this. I was dumb, but they are a bit shady.  I'm not going to let that happen again.

Why?  I'm reading How Money Got Free right now and they follow the founders of Blockchain closely,  it the first I've heard of their wallet.  What happened to them, seems like they were THE wallet early on.  Maybe I'll just keep reading.

You should be able to, the Bitcoin isn't actually on your phone.  If you know the public address you could look it up on the block explorer to see if the funds are still in the address.  If they are still there, the next step would be finding your private keys which your seed phrase should give you access to.  Keep trying the seed phrase.  It should still be there.

I’m just starting out learning about nodes so I can’t really answer that yet.  I’m also interested in why running a tor node is a good idea.  So much to learn. But I feel like this will be valuable information in the coming years.

Ok.  I need to figure out how to use it with my Trezor. Shouldn’t be too difficult to sort that out, but I haven’t seen much info with a cursory glance at google.

Ok I’ll look into that.

What he said. The benefit of Bitcoin is being able to run a full node without any specialized equipment which, as I understand it, won’t be possible with bcash.

It’s the miners who can prioritize transactions as far as I understand.  They usually chose those who paid the highest fee.

Yea, that was my intent, but I didn’t see any flair to tag it with.  But definitely related to Bitcoin and the it’s origins from the 2008 fiasco.

Still waiting on kyc upgrade. Sent new docs a few weeks ago. I've written it off as lost cause.   Coinsbank seems better, a bit slow customer service but seems reputable although I still haven't bought anything with my card.
