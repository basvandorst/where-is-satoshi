What are all these other cryptocurencies? How can I learn more about it.
At what point should I not have my coins on coinbase?

Thank you!

Can someone clarify bitcoin fees to me? 
When do I transaction fees?
If I buy $20 dollars of bitcoin a week on coinbase how does that affect how the fees are going to work in the future? 
Would it be better to save $20 a week and buy in chunks of 100-200? Or does it not make a difference?
When are the fees applied? When I try to take my money into my own wallet outside of coinbase?
Is there anyway to avoid the fees?
I'm just trying to figure all of this stuff out before going any further. Like everyone says I'm only buying bitcoin with money I can afford to completely loose and I'm comfortable doing about $20-30 a week. But would like to know if its actually going to cost me more in the long run instead of buying in larger amounts.
Thank you guys for the help.

In planning in buying a Trezor next month, I've never had a wallet before and have just been using coinbase so far. Is there a video I can watch on how that all works and how to set up and transfer and add stuff to that wallet from now on? I'm sure its easy I'm just so paranoid of screwing something up I'd love to know more about that process and using a wallet like that.

Is coinbase not a good way to buy bitcoin? Honestly the only reason I started using coinbase was because way back when I used a faucet the money went staright into a coinbase account I made. Seemed so easy and made the process simple. However I have not kept up with everything and never actually had a wallet of my own that isnt on coinbase.

Its in the OP album juat scroll down there is a couple more pics.
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:21:30
The only place I have an account is coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:03:56
Look I'm really new to this whole thing and I really appreciate the advice but it would be helpful if you could explain the difference and why it's stupid. I just don't know.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:08:29
I mean I want it to stay like this for a while and go up either gradually or in 3-5 years. Because I'm trying to accumulate some bitcoin if the price soars right now I don't really have enough for it to be significant in any way and makes buying harder and more risky.

I would like to swe it take a small dip again. I was planning on buying some next friday.

What is the music in the video?
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:43:11
I mean ill be honest. I have some in hopes to make some gain, just I don't see it as a quick thing. Now if it takes off and in the future i can use my btc just like money and pay my bills then even better. If this is the price and stays stable I'm ok with that too and ill keep using it as a store of value.

I feel we might hit 80k after the halvening and the fomo hits, I do feel like that we will come down to around 30-35k and that being the new normal until we repeat this cycle again.

Its not everybody, its one user tipping everyone.

Coinbase pro is only available on desktop.

Its almost as if the sub is comprised of multiple people with different opinions.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:08:03
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:49:35
You guys are fucking idiots, I don't watch any crypto youtubers but as a sub that's screaming for decentralization how can you agree with the ban? I'm 100% bitcoin don't have any alts and never will but this sub is honestly garbage.
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:46:05
Thank you so much for the response, this is very helpful.
You said the device only holds the passwords to spend the coin. What are those passwords called? Is that what the private keys are?
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:24:44
But this isnt something that I would actually know, like what my private key is? Its not like a password I need right?

They won't need it because I doubt any of them will be in any real relationship. How couples deal with their finances is their business and per find what works for them wether that be joint or separate accounts. But these guys value their SO's opinions about the same as a childs.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:29:06
Ok, thank you.

I did not but the ledger made me enter in all 24 words during set up after it told me to write them down.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:15:04
Damn then you must have smoked a ton.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:22:12
Why? I feel like using my pc is riskier than my phone. But I'm open to hear you out. What is coolwallet?
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:06:24
Whatever dude, there is no reason for me to promote the product. I just wanted to move my coins from coinbase and I didnt want to screw it up. If anything I have been somewhat disappointed the thing feels loose, no resistance to sliding it out, the 2 other coins I want to keep on there don't actually show up in the ledger live app. And after reading a bit on the ledger sub it seems like the storage space is super limited and you can barely have 2-3 apps on at a time. I did ask questions and everyone has been helpful why even waste your time for such pointless comment. Especially when you're totally off base. And I literally said ledger nano s once in the post. Pretty sad you made a new account just to waste your time.

But you're willing to risk getting a loan and being in debt if this goes bad but not willing to risk selling and buying back in lower. There's no way in hell this just shoots back up past 6.5k so fast you can't buy back in before. Yeah its a little late for that but what if this goes lower like 2k before it goes back up I sold and if it startwd going back up this second ill be able to buy in lower then I sold. And if I don't and I miss out and buy back in a little higher then I sold I loose a lot less then taking a loan out and having a much shittier situation on my hands. If your going to gamble like that then why not gamble with what you already have.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:06:58
What about now when its at 4700? I'm not exiting but I luckily sold when it dropped to 6k with plans to come back in lower, now I can a decent chunk more by buying back in I'm just waiting to see how low this might go. Yes there is a chance it goes up and I end up buying in for a loss but come on man its not going to shoot up to 6k so fast that I can't buy back in before any losses. I was going to buy back in at 5500 but it just seems to keep going down. I'm not out but at this point I can see it freefalling a bit longer and I'm almost 100% certain ill be able to buy back on the way up before it gets back to 6k.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:54:41
I think he's talking about 1 billion satoshi not a billion dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:47:37
That's what I'm doing I sold half at 6.2k and the rest at 5.5k. I can buy back in now for a good chunk more then I had.
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:40:02
Ok then if you look up the post you'll see that he actually says "I shouldn't have uped it from the original amount" so he actually increased it and gave more.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:36:03
Link? Id like to see
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:06:19
There has been a post on here twice now only a couple days ago from someone who fell for it. He sent a food amount too like over $2k
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:57:02
Exactly I definitely HODL long term but come on guys if you're going to ignore something like this you're being stupid. I sold at 6k with plans to buy back in lower. Was planing to get back in a 5.5k but decided to wait just a bit as everyone seemed convinved it wad going lower and with such a drop there could be some panic selling. Well after seeing what's happened I can wait lomger and see where this stops there is no way it shoots up so fast that I cant buy in lower then 6k. I do believe its going to come back up and even higher then 6.5k but its gonna take some time and I'm going to get more bitcoin with what I already had instead of risking more I'm this uncertain time.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:34:49
But does he? Since he wont be cashing out the bitcoins? I thought you only have to pay tax on the capital gains.
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:06:38
Alright I'm gonna ask this here because I've been wondering for a bit now. What is a mixer and what purpose does it serve?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:01:48
You act like it's going to jump 5k within minutes and no chance to buy.
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:54:47
If you buy with card its instant but the fees are even bigger. If you buy with direct bank account the fees are lower but it won't let you take it off coinbase for almost 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:01:31
Not for coinbase pro.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:18:09
Except she's was making like 75% of thier money and was pissed he gambled 25% of their savings and tried to hide it and lie about it. This has nothing to with her being a "money whore" or bitcoin just a dude being a shotty partner.
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:35:38
Listen I wouldn't recommend it for my parents and nor do I think they'd wamt to buy into it. But at the same time if he explains it to them a bit and they decide they want to take a risk thats totally on them. They can keep bothering you at that point but it ain't my problem.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:43:21
Yes but even if you think bitcoin is bullshit the question is $1 or 1 BTC which is $8000 the only way you choose the dollar is you dont know absolutely anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:29:25
But at this point they are making their own decision to buy more, he gave them free bitcoin if they decide to buy some that's on them and their responsibility to do some research before they do something like putting their savings in it.
