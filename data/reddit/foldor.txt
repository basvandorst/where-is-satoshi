Oh, I get that it can be worthwhile to hold onto the coin for the future. But I feel that if someone told me to buy something from them because it will make me rich later, I'd be immediately suspicious. It's best to get people interested for other reasons first, and then let them decide if they would prefer to hold onto their coins or not.

Thank you for not focusing on using bitcoins as an investment. I know it's an unpopular opinion around here, but we shouldn't be telling people that buying bitcoins is going to make them rich, it comes off as sounding like a scam.  
  
Quick, tip. There's a significant amount of wasted HTML comments in the source code that can easily be cleaned up for a smaller file size to reduce bandwidth and load times.

Version numbers do not follow that convention. That should be obvious by the fact that there are already two decimal places. They could easily have a v0.9.21 in eighteen releases and not break convention at all.

Just a heads up, but you no longer need to use np.reddit.com to get https.

No, because at a certain point our computers will become so much more powerful, and bitcoin mining would instead start focusing on "mining" unused/lost wallets. They're not completely unbreakable, just REALLY fucking difficult. Like astronomically difficult. But given enough incentive, and computing power, it becomes possible.

What I am talking about essentially is brute forcing someones private key. It's been a while since I've looked into bitcoins, but if I recall there is a very public record of all bitcoin transactions. Isn't it possible to notice certain bitcoins not moving for many years? So if 10 years form now people are seeing a pile of btc that hasn't moved in a decade, they might assume it's "lost" (or they won't care, theft does happen). They might then attempt to steal it by bruteforcing the private key.

Yeah, but older wallets that were lost before then won't have the new encryption
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:12:56
But you're more likely to have the time necessary for lost keys.

Just a thought, but what about what World of Warcraft does for it's more paranoid users? There's those keychain things that generate a one time use code every time it's pressed, and it's necessary to login.

Best of luck with that. It's nice to see your in it for the long term. But I wouldn't expect it to hit $50 any time soon, if ever.

Whoa, if you're Visa is maxed out are you sure buying into a incredibly unstable market is the best idea? I'm pulling for BTC as much as the anyone, but with such an uncertain future I wouldn't invest heavily into it if I had so much to lose as you seem to. Please, I beg you to reconsider what could possibly be the worst financial mistake of your life. Pay off the Visa.

You're right, I'm sure you've solved the problem of international shipping from multiple distribution centres and multiple carriers, over item sizes of incredibly varying sizes/weights/contents. Please, for the love of God send your resume to Newegg right now and save us!

[bitmarket]( has always worked for me.

You do realize they don't make the shipping prices right?

There really isn't. For a financial market security must be taken with the utmost in security in mind. Luckily I'm Canadian and decided to stay the hell away from mtgox. I'm currently trading on VirtEx and it's pretty sweet so far, with no fees either.

There are developer bitcoin networks for this. Give me a minute and I'll provide a link. 
  
Edit: [Here's]( something I quickly found, it may help out.  
It looks like you need to start Bitcoin from command line with -testnet parameter or something.  
  
Edit 2: [Here's]( the last link. Probably the best one. It says you can even just testnet=1 in your bitcoin.conf file.
@_date: 2011-06-18 18:38:20
Yeah, I'm going to call BS on this stuff as well. It's best not to give them any undeserved hits.
@_date: 2011-06-13 18:14:33
Can I just suggest that you don't buy into Bitcoins for the sole purpose of making money? If that's the only reason people are buying them, they're essentially valueless. What gives them real value in my eyes is the ability to trade them for goods and services.

$400 CAD and I'm already out of the game with about $500 CAD. So I made a nice little profit and it was a fun experiment.

Bitcoin isn't brand new though. It's over 2 years old, but it's only recently that it's gotten this explosive growth.

Theoretically the point they're trying to make is true. No one know's *who* is behind the Bitcoin addresses unless they come and and state it. Though yeah, the could have made it clear that it's incredibly easy to track the Bitcoins themselves.

Yeah I had actually heard about that, but I wasn't sure if they used the same technology. But it is something I think most people would be interested in since even if in the unlikely event it were hacked, there's still your password they would need to break.
