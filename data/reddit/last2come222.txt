It is true, bitcoin does need to be accepted by more for it to go further however I fear that the bad press it can sometimes get can lower people's trust in bitcoin therefore lowering the public acceptance which is a shame. It's something I feel we have to over ride though and try and get the word out there that bitcoin is not as bad as many make it out to be.

Hey guys, I heard it takes 140 million breast-strokes to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
Am I doin it wrong ?? ?

great news 
good to hear this

This is a nice intro piece for people who don't know anything about Bitcoin. Plus they get capitalization right, and say the currency is digital rather than virtual.

Thanks for posting the list. There were a few people I just learned about and have never heard of before.

Proof of State coin is not a decentralized currency.

It's a good sign, first it's on a front page, second it will help to popularize btc 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:10:52
they are weaving a plot by saying like this, "turning point" what is it exactly? positive or negative point?

In TV-series 'Almost Human' they showed 'bitcoin stick' as a future payment method and I loved it.

My take so that you have some kind of interest in the a metals website be it you are employed by them or you own it and that you are trying to push traffic toward it.

Naked short selling must be done and that will make bitcoin grow up bit by bit
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:16:45
hard say to whether it is stable or not in such a short period of time. but the best tip I can give you here is : no panic!

When I think about bitcoin I always see a relation with internet and smartphones explosion

I don't believe that the ATMs will allow people to swap bitcoin for cash
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:23:12
Well, it actually is somewhat of a mixture between anonymity and pseudonymity. If you do know the owner of an address, you can track the respective transactions. Thus the anonymity is being void.

Bitpay in St. Petersburg simply justifies the belief that the BTC boom is near.This is wonderful news.

The Mt Gox fiasco over the past few days caused mainstream media outlets to declare that the bitcoin bubble has popped.

there is a well known You Tube video of Gavin saying he was invited by In-Q-Tel and ended up in a meeting with the Head of CIA.
oh wait , did that happen? does that video still exist?
based on eye movement and facial expression Gavin is "Satoshi" or at least he done a fair amount of writing for him. 
why hide it? so what? - if they weren't interested in this project someone's not doing their job.
But i think is was created independently either by the NSA/Google guys  (based off the 1996 white paper) just because no one specifically said they shouldn't do it.  (Lego land movie scenario) 
there is such a huge crossover of employees from the NSA to Google, no one could track what project is being worked on, until constant flags (key words)
"Decentralized" "anarchist" "money" "crypto" "cryptography" "political" "Government" etc etc...
were likely turning up on say this forum and other forum, and always in reference to "Bitcoin" 
so in 2011 (or whenever it was) - Gavin gets "called in" 
rest is history.

Classic quote, that made me laugh. Satoshi may be a common name in Japan but it's a nice name. Better that some of the stupid names celebrities come up with for there kids.

This is what I suspected as well!
Whales could potentially push the price down to margin levels while buying large amounts off exchange
Coindesk reported on the effects of margin but I find it suspicious that Bitfinex put out a release stating that margins apparently didn't cause the drop (which is obviously what happened)
I'm not too concerned though...take this as an opportunity to buy

If you don't take the time to do the math on projected mining ROI, and follow difficulty like a hawk, you should not be mining unless it's just a hobby and you don't mind losing money.

Congratulations on the milestone! There are 9 ATM's in The Netherlands, which I find incredible, seeing that The Netherlands is a very small country. For example, Germany has only two!

I don't think it's going to be Paypal making or Breaking Bitcoin but the other way around.  Paypal is the one that needs Bitcoin, if it's not Paypal it will be someone else taking advantage of the opportunity that clear as day.  People don't see Bitcoin for the innovative technology that it is and that is simply underestimating the potential for growth it has in many different ways.

id look at where the funds came from and google search the address to see if i can find the sender. then if lucky to find him(yes ud be surprised how many people publicly publish their addresses), see if it was sent by mistake and return it.*
if i couldnt find him id leave it aside for a month to see if anyone shouts on reddit or here about accidentally sending funds elsewhere and if the addresses match. send it back*
*asking the person to sign a message using the send address to prove original ownership.
if both of those fail and its been over a month. then id use the funds to invest in businesses that have legitimate business plans and a feasible idea that shows some actual benefit to the community.

Strange, this looks like Necker Island? (which happens to be a private island) It's possibly a scam, if you ask me.

You were at least correct about Mt Gox, it was a scam.

Your main problem with mining was buying scrypt asics. As far as I can tell, scrypt ASICs have always been extremely overpriced. I did the math a while back, and best case they would have hit ROI in about 9-12 months.
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:03:49
A quick check of your past posts clearly show me that's your take anyway.

I'll stick to BTC mining with a 3-4 month ROI if hardware purchases are well timed. If you had used that money to purchase Antminer S1s instead, you would be in a much better position right now.
