111k BTC means 61.73 days of mining this is a lot and the buyers will take a long time to consume it. But I don't think this whale is going away so close to the bitcoin halving when the price will probably increase. But there is a lot of fiat money he can make now, excluding fees, taxes etc.

Bitcoin Rain a ponzi scheme in Brazil (15k BITCOIN THEFT.)
I have some terrible things to say: In 2013 the exchange named Mercado Bitcoin (MercadoBitcoin.net) in Brazil created a ponzi scheme (+10% IR/month) called 'BITCOIN RAIN'(Making it rain bitcoins) and the coins one day disappeared . We contacted the justice but because de justice in Brazil is so slow, MB was supposely sold out to a new owner and the creator of MB and BITCOIN RAIN (Leandro Cesar) is still 'free and happy' somewhere probably full of money. This year THE SAME EXCHANGE (MB) created a partneship with IBM to create this "marketing stuff" you can see in this video. How is it possible? A single search in Google for 'bitcoin rain mercado' will show you. A slap on the face of the users affected.

I believe in attack as well. 
If you see the bitstamp walls at the moment you will see that the sell walls are short while the buy walls are 10x bigger, usually the price go up in situations like this. 
I can "see" a lot of bots buying slowly (0.1, 0.3btc), accumulating and selling all at once (5, 10, 15btc) trying to push the price down breaking the buy pressure. Someone or a group with a lot of money is moving the price down and exchanges can be behind it as well using fractional reserve and selling fake bitcoins.
PS: Always buy and withdraw. Increase their risk of default, if they are doing FR they must go bankrupt.

Why the GHash is so huge? Because of cloud mining! Look at this: Big countries like Brasil with big corrupted gov have dozens of taxes over electricity so mining is terrible unviable. What should brazilians do? Trust an foreigner to create an shared mining machine or invest in cloud mining. When another pools adopt cloud mining ghash.io will not be a problem anymore.  cex is selling mining power at 0.06btc/ghs when the price should be something like 0.01btc/ghs.

Thank you for this comment, there is a lot of people here that do not respect or understand what we are trying to create . A few years ago, the community was a lot of bitcoin lovers, taking your life-time to maintain or create everything here. I feel the same disappointment .

The same problem here. 
Is all the Bitcoin infra under DDoS in the last days? who is against us?

The first thing you have to do now is create backups of this wallet. Pendrive, external hd, etc etc etc.
Ok, now you can try opening it. ;-)
Good Luck.

The question is: How many Bitcoins Warren owns? ;-)

Sell low, buy high. I did the same stupid thing. =( The most 'winner strategy' at this moment was 'buy, hold, and sell months later'.

In five years it will be: You *only* can buy a fraction of one bitcoin.

I totally agree with you! I want to make a "world tour" using only hostels and the bigger problem is credit card fees or money conversion. I hope the HI and HW take a look at Bitcoin ASAP.

I can't understand yet how bitcoin can be traced using colors.. for example: 
I have 
BLUE 0.25btc in addr A and 
RED  0.75btc in addr B then I join 
both in addr C.
After it I send 0.2 to my uncle and 0.5 to my grandma. 
Did my uncle receive BLUE or RED btc? Is it from addr A or addr B?

When I go to Germany in 2014 I know where I will order my pizza. ;-)
