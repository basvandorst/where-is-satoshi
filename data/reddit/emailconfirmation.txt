I can see potential for this to grow into something big or dwindle into nothing, it all depends on the 21inc software stack and what you can do with it.  
  
edit: I just pre-ordered my Proof of Stake in the 21 inc ecosystem. ;)

No one can speak to the value because the value is based on what you can do with it and we don't know the extent of that yet.
  
What we do know is that it comes with the 21inc software stack and integrates into their back-end infrastructure.  Presumably that is the value because the 21inc software stack is not available as stand-alone software that you can run without this hardware.  It might end up being that you can't join the 21inc back-end without a 21inc chip.
  
Balaji has talked a lot in the past about creating closed loop ecosystems and that is exactly what this appears to be.  There is also mention of players not being equal and them being judged based on their contribution to the network.  I presume that means contribution to the 21inc network.  So it might mean that by being an early adopter now, you end up with rewards later that you wouldn't otherwise be entitled to.  
  
If the 21 inc software stack ends up being a robust stack and accomplished everything that say ethereum accomplishes, well you can see how that could be a game changer.

When you start a withdraw, they send an email to the email address for the account and you have to click it to confirm the withdraw, did you do that?
  
I've done some BTC withdraws in the last few days without issue..
