I believe that may have been the case pre-gpgpu.

TIL ATI should stop making GPUs because they have no value.. silly.
@_date: 2012-02-19 23:47:29
The context is in a hardware sale.  GPUs depreciate naturally regardless of bitcoin mining rewards xD.

if you want to host:
ruby: 
perl: 
Of course you need to write the text -&gt; image part but there are two wrappers which is most of the work.

Someone would have to host a script which pulls the rate from mtgox feed/api and generates a image.  Then a moderator can use CSS (the only customization that reddit provides) and set a background image to reference

Yeah actually it's founded on being a surface web marketplace (with the main currency being Bitcoins).  There's a strong virtual item / gaming presence currently, but you can buy/trade/sell anything.

Wow that's a solid investment
@_date: 2012-01-30 03:09:03
this ^
or you can use the chrome extension i'm writing at this moment which will display it next to url bar :)

Holy smokes!  Maybe you could find someone needing a render farm willing to buy them.

what I really meant is: why should you believe anyone is giving an honest response to this question
@_date: 2012-02-20 23:00:28
it's suuuuper soft 
i had one pair of pima cotton boxer briefs, bought 5 more pairs after them and had to research why they sucked so bad in comparison.  pima cotton is the reason and it's all i'll wear now (:
@_date: 2012-01-30 05:38:42
Well shit.. yes but with no customization xD
Here it is if you want to use it instead for whatever reason...
Shows realtime average in USD and changes color based on if the last update was up/down/neutral.  I was planning on adding everything that MtGox one has and some other features like seeing your current Ogrr balance when the button is clicked...  Maybe I'll still do it xD
@_date: 2012-01-27 02:31:06
why would anyone give you an honest response to this question though?

They could even HTTP auth protect it and popup a username/password window as a phishing attempt. Not that I think anyone here would do/fall for that and it would be removed quite quickly. 
@_date: 2012-02-20 00:39:15
It's a special feature developed for Ogrr

The site ogrr is the project of the ceo of the largest Diablo 2 item shop. I'd say they will have a better chance than anyone to make this work.

first thought: he doesn't sound austrian
@_date: 2012-02-20 15:40:22
no pima cotton == no go
@_date: 2012-02-20 13:02:49
In this case partly they are invested into communities like

installing a browser extension is super technical for an internet porn user?
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:09:08
This is the stupidest thing I've heard all year, on all accounts
