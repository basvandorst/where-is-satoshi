I am not going to go searching through old comments to find evidence that will mean nothing to you.  You have proven yourself so closed to reason that there is nothing that will change your mind.  
Theymos has already stated that even if 95% of people choose big blocks than he will ban them all from this sub.  It is obvious that this is the opinion of ALL the mods.  No evidence can turn that kind of religion.
Your attitudes toward the members of this sub is appalling.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:29:16
The mods of this sub need to do some serious soul searching, especially if you think that you are all victims.  Openly discussing a topic and the people involved in that topic are not the same as banning and censorship.
The subscribers of r/Bitcoin are the customers of r/Bitcoin (and the customers of Bitcoin proper) and the customers have clearly shown that they prefer their sub and their currency to function a certain way and if you don't start listening than this sub and this currency will suffer the same fate as other companies that fail to listen to their customers.
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:19:51
It is infuriating to see a mod on this sub say that the big block side uses underhanded tactics to stifle debate when it is you who are banning people and discussion of certain solutions as well as sorting comments by "controversial" in order to make your opinions seem more popular than they really are.
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:48:34
Punishing how? Having most people disagree with you is not a punishment, it's reality.

@_date: 2015-12-27 23:44:38


Because the example of the underhanded tactics you linked to was of r/btc asking why some blockstream supporter is relevant.  I don't think there is anything wrong with that and is not comparable to what goes on here.


I think most subscribers agree with one or more proposed big block solutions, which is why the mods get downvoted like they do and pro big block comments get upvoted.  It isn't bots and it isn't a conspiracy, it's the users voicing their opinions.


You can't be serious! Do the mods here really have their heads this far in the sand?!
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:46:00

You need to read my comment more carefully.  I said in 50 years one SATOSHI might be $50 if too many bitcoins are inaccessible due to lost keys.  A satoshi is the smallest division of bitcoin.  If the smallest unit of a currency is too large to buy lunch with than something needs to be changed.

@_date: 2016-01-23 18:33:59
increasing the blocksize limit is mildly inconvenient at most.  Most people agree with it and it will need to be done eventually so it is best to do it sooner rather than later.
And Segwit, while probably a good idea, only provides scaling comparable to a 2mb limit, and likely wont take effect for another year.  So what happens when we come up on *that* limit?  Segwit times two or something?  And what happens if bitcoin needs to scale past the limits in 3 months?  Sidechains aren't ready, segwit isn't ready and a blocksize limit increase has massive support and several of the most prominent developers behind it.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:17:21
So the RBF strategy is to make Bitcoin unnecessarily complicated then teach people all of its unnecessary features so they know how not to use them?

You are right.  I want and need more capacity for bitcoin, and the core devs have proposed limited, short term solutions for that and have been extremely hostile to the easy, simple, long term solution of dealing with the block size limit.
Also core implemented RBF which everyone hates and may well destroy bitcoin. So fuck that.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:28:17
But you can still use Bitcoin without running a FN, most don't.  Surely, you have to accept that the vast majority of users aren't going to run a full node in order to use LN.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:18:20

I thought everyone was a potential customer of bitcoin.  A permissionless peer to peer money that is supposed to free societies from oppressive monetary regimes.  Isn't that the goal?  Because that's not possible at 3tx/sec.

@_date: 2016-01-25 17:03:01
This is a good point but RBF lowers the barrier to entry for double spends which is not good.  They could have helped the stuck transaction problem by having RBF where you can't redirect the transaction or by raising block size limits but instead they went with full RBF that is extremely controversial.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:04:07

@_date: 2016-01-23 19:34:44
You must have been under a rock during the proposal and rollout of RBF if you don't think that everyone hates it.
So what happens if I go to a store and attempt to use an RBF transaction to purchase my goods and the clerk rejects the transaction?  Do I then need to retransmit the transaction back to myself and then wait 10 minutes plus for the transaction to be verified before attempting to purchase the item again with non RBF?  because that sounds like a shitty user experience.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:38:38

@_date: 2016-03-03 16:46:10
Gavin isn't an engineer?
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:59:16
classic already has significant support.  Some 75%+ of mining power supports it.  and yes I know 1mb is not enough but we tried xt and that had a lot of support, then you had all the censorship and banning that caused it to fall out of consciousness.  this 2mb is just to get the ball rolling and show that needed scaling upgrades can take place without the sky falling.
But the reality is that bitcoin needs to scale at least a little bit **as soon as possible** in order to survive another year while developers come up with long term scaling solutions.   And core doesn't have *any* scaling solutions besides segwit, which does nothing in the short term and is a one time fix that only scales the network another 75%.  What happens when segwit blocks are full and the core developers *still* refuse to raise the limit?
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:59:28
this is still not a good comparison to the current debate since the limited quantity is partly what makes bitcoin valuable and limiting the block size is more likely to hurt its value than help it.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:50:22
No. Customers want scalability and they want it now.  
Segwit may well be a good idea but its scaling properties are limited and they won't take effect for another year or more even by the developers own predictions.
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:23:00
Okay now you aren't even debating.
I'm not really sure what you're doing...
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:14:18
Maybe. It depends.
What if 50 years from now most bitcoin are irretrievable due to lost and private keys and each satoshi is worth $50 equivalent.
You have two options.  You can either allow bitcoin to be divided even further or raise the cap.  Either one would be fundamentally changing bitcoin.
But this is a ridiculous example when compared to raising the block size limit, which most people agree needs to be done.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:04:05

@_date: 2016-06-21 12:46:04
God help you if you can't understand the difference between the coin limit and the block limit.  
The price of Bitcoin doesn't matter because Bitcoin is a unit of account and is divisible.  There is no such thing as Bitcoin being too expensive as long as you can divide it down into smaller units.  Now if 1 satoshi becomes equal to one dollar then yes, we will either need to increase the number of coins or allow for further division.
The block size limit increases the cost of a transaction.  A transaction fee is a fee for service.  If the cost goes too high then it discourages transactions and limits its ability to grow.
Also the block limit was artificially imposed by satoshi as a short term problem with the expressed idea that it would be raised it removed.
Don't play stupid and pretend those two limits are the same thing.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:37:45
how about their is no block size limit?  or let the miners decide what block size they want?  or let miners determine the fee?

According to your theory blocks should have been full since the beginning of bitcoin and not just a slow, steady incline.  
Also if miners could determine fees with no block limit or determine block size with no hard limit then there is no attack vector.

Some things sold on the open market are not divisible, like a plane ticket, but most things *are* divisible, like food or gold or many other things.  The divisibility of many market items is one thing that makes sure that everyone who wants one can get one.  But the way to make sure the plane ticket is inclusive is to increase the supply.
I was pointing out that transactions aren't divisible (as in a transaction cannot be shared) therefore transaction space, if limited, is exclusionary.  Not everyone who wants one will be able to get one.
With some things this exclusionary feature is okay, like a Ferrari.  But Ferrari's are exclusive play things of the very rich and their exclusiveness is a desired feature.  Bitcoin is supposed to be the money of the people where anyone who wants to send money can.

You seem to be confusing the price of bitcoin with the price of a bitcoin *transaction*.  Transactions cannot be divided, otherwise there would be no backlog.  Two people can not go in together a split a transaction fee and then share the transaction.  This is self evident.
No one else besides you wants your grandmother's paintings or your family dog, but we have tens of thousands of people who want a bitcoin transaction and if there is more demand than supply than it doesn't matter how high the price of transaction goes.
In normal marketplaces supply fluctuates, people can divide risk by buying in groups, and buyers know what the price of the thing they are buying is.  None of these are true with bitcoin transactions as they currently stand.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:56:28
If number 1 was untrue than we wouldn't have people posting here all the time saying they sent a transaction 10 hours ago and it hasn't confirmed, only to find out that their fee wasn't big enough.  You don't go to McDonalds and accidentally under-pay and then never receive your big mac.  This doesn't happen because the price is right there on the menu and if you underpay than the cashier will tell you and then you pay difference.
As for number 2, everything you mentioned is absolutely divisible.  I share a jug of milk, a table and blocks of cheese with my wife.  A transaction cannot be shared with my wife and that limits access to the marketplace of transactions.
For number 3.  Yes there are some things that are limited in supply and not divisible, like the Mona Lisa, a Ferrari or a ticket on Virgin Galactic.  The problem is that these are things for the very rich.  If bitcoin is going to be a transaction system for the common man than transactions either need to be divisible or have an increasing supply.  You should also notice that for this one I used a caveat, saying that bitcoin as the protocol currently functions does does not allow the supply of transactions to increase to meet demand.  Yes, segwit will increase transactions but that is currently not in the protocol and will not fix the problems of a fee market not being able to exist.

Did you read the post?  Just because prices increase doesn't mean that fees are behaving in the way that pricing in a marketplace works.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:02:36
But at a normal auction all of the bidders know what the current bid is and know what they have to bid in order to win.  Currently almost no one checks the average fee before sending a transaction
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:24:51
That would be very convenient and welcome, but it might also confuse people since it's not how consumers are used to performing transactions.  
I don't really know how I stand on users engaging in a bidding war with fees (given that a "fee market" was a real possibility) because that's not how people purchase most things in their lives, like big macs and gasoline and even regular credit card transactions. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:15:21
It's true that there are ways to find out a reasonable fee but not from a consumer user experience standpoint.  When I buy gasoline I don't first have to research the price of oil and then offer the gas station a price based on my research.  There is simply a price and then I determine if it is worth it to buy.  This is how nearly all consumer goods work but it is not how transaction pricing works otherwise we wouldn't have people constantly complaining about their unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:08:42
If what you are saying is true then there would be no backlog.  There is a backlog therefore what you are saying is not true.
Fact: Nearly all users do not know the minimum price it will take to verify their transaction in the next block.
Fact:  There is a limited supply of transactions in every block that cannot be increased without protocol changes.
Fact: The current number of transactions cannot be spread around or shared to ease demand.
All of these are true and prevent a "fee market" from behaving like an actual market.

Segwit and RBF are more dramatic changes than a 2mb block limit.  A hard fork IS the conservative choice.
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:50:28
Coinbase is not a public company, so no, and Gavin is not a company at all, so no.  And if that were true than you should be equally skeptical of Blockstream and the core devs.
Also Coinbase's success is predicated on bitcoins success so they have a strong incentive to advocate for what is best for Bitcoin, whereas blockstreams success is predicated on bitcoins failure to scale so blockstream and the core devs actually have an incentive to strangle bitcoins ability to scale and several core devs have admitted as much.

Also it's great that you can just admit to sticking your head in the sand when it comes to criticisms of Core and blockstream.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:23:02
number 3 is only true if number 2 is also true.  Bitcoin itself has a limited supply but it is divisible meaning that users can buy *parts* of a bitcoin so they aren't completely excluded from the market, but if bitcoin *weren't* divisible than a lot of people would be priced out of the market..  And number 1 is true from a user experience standpoint.

My guess is the government only recently cracked down on them

It's possible that he has the coins on a paper wallet in a safe in Australia.  That would take a couple of days to get.

How can I find out if there is a miner near me whose facilities I can tour?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:15:35
Thank you very much! 100 bits
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:23:54
Yeah, bitcoin doesn't need speculators to determine its price!
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:51:56
If the only problem is contention then everyone need only agree for there to be no problems.  So why don't you just agree to hard fork?
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:58:45
Is it possible to do hands off recurring payments with bitcoin? Like can my internet bill automatically get paid every month without me having to do anything?
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:54:05
I thought non-bitcoin topics were banned here.
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:54:32
Yeah, bitcoin doesn't need to be used by regular people!
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:14:09
Yeah, we just need to those r/btc morons that bitcoin isn't money!
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:00:03
Yeah, no one needs to like bitcoin in order for it to grow!
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:21:43
Yeah, we can't have anyone with an agenda in charge of this sub!  :/
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:45:52
Yeah, bitcoin doesn't need users to grow!  We can grow *without* users!
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:09:29
Why do you think they are pushing anything and not just reacting to the marketplace?
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:54:30
How was it contentious and nasty?
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:13:18
And Blockstream is run by the Bilderberg group.
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:26:00
Yeah, bitcoin needs a proven unifier like Theymos! :/
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:23:35
I think that bitcoin needs to far surpass visa though.  Just as people send more emails in a week now then people sent letters over the course of a year before email existed.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:07:30
Yeah, bitcoin isn't money, it's a computer!
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:13:02
Haha!  Isn't it hilarious how disaffected users are losing hope in a technology they once loved!?  That's what makes Bitcoin the future! :S
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:48:35
does the blockchain wallet charge fees for moving money?
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:14:09
Everyone is saying that the user experience is lacking and yet I have been told for a year now on this sub that user experience doesn't matter.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:42:49
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:14:23
But now how do I know what my change address is?  And what the private key for the change address?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:52:22
For the answer to your questions look at the non-bitcoin communities on the sidebar.
Agorism, Austrian-economics and anarcho-capitalism are great resources.
Unfortunately we have been lead up to believe that there is simply no other way to run a society other than for a massive monopolistic entity to force people to do this and do that.  In the future we will look back on governments the same way we look back on institutional slavery and on human sacrifices.  I believe that bitcoin is an integral part of realizing that future by allowing people to interact and avoid the states meddlesome fingers.

My agenda is for bitcoin to succeed.  Do you have a different agenda?
