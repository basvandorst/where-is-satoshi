Lol jesus christ bitcoiners are so delusional. 100k before end of 2018 you literally are insane. Maybe 100k pennies

Just hoping it holds a little longer (I bought at $875) until I get my BTC then I can sell it back at a small loss, and buy more when it's down to like 300 bucks

Sweet I didn't realize he was on JRE. I'll have to listen to that episode now. Does he talk about bitcoin on the podcast at all?

I just chatted with their customer service. I would have to file a dispute. I'm sure I could win it, because I've worked for software sales and if people dispute with their bank they pretty much always win even if they've fully agreed to the terms &amp; conditions. I won't be that guy. I'll take the hit if it is lower when coinbase *finally* gives me the BTC. Hoping this china news isn't as bad as it sounds..

At this point I don't know if I should re-buy via credit card or something.. The price is up another $80 since when I made that first transaction. Do you think there will be another dip down to the $1,000 range?
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:54:25
Ah now that makes sense. Thanks for the for dummies explanation!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:39:39
I understand some of those words... God I feel dumb. I probably shouldn't have dropped $1k on bitcoin a couple of days ago since I don't understand it at all.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:54:45
How does the instant buy work? If i put in a credit card, does it still use my bank account for the withdrawal but just hold the CC info as a backup? I might try it that way
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:50:05
I do have 2 factor authentication on for coin base. I guess it's mandatory, so that makes me feel a bit better
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:38:31
haha seriously. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:45:34
Yep those are pretty big words

I just chatted with bank of america support. they don't see any declined transactions/transfers and said I should contact the merchant since it must have declined from their end
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:04:53
seriously. gross.

I just chatted with bank of america support. they don't see any declined transactions/transfers and said I should contact the merchant since it must have declined from their end. I sent an email to coinbase too but haven't gotten a reply yet.
Now I have to figure out if I want to buy back in now that the price of btc is $100 higher than it was when I first tried... 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:54:13
Right.. I assume since it verified ok there wasn't a problem with the info I gave coinbase. Can't even get onto coinbase right now the site seems to be down..
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:54:45
I just did. Bought 1 btc on coinbase. Guess i can kiss that $1k goodbye!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:34:15
also commenting so i can read this later. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:28:49
Bought mine at $875... Finally just got the coin in my coinbase account. Not sure if I want to hang on or just dump it before it drops further
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:40:22
Hmm the only thing I can think of is that I didn't put my middle initial on coinbase for name on account, and on bank of america it's listed as First Middle initial Last. Usually that doesn't matter, though.

Can you explain hash functions, please?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:05:14
Do you have a link to any instructions for setting up a paper wallet? If I send the bitcoin(s) to a paper wallet does it still exist in coinbase also? If/when I sell, how would I do so through a paper wallet? Can it be easily sent back?
