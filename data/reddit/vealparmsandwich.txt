Kind of misses the point that unions and strikes have had an enormous impact on the plight of the common man over the past two centuries. Workers should be united in a position of power to make demands of the gatekeepers of industry. We owe a lot of the privileges we enjoy and take for granted today to union movements.


Ignores the fact that humans have physical limitations, limited time and lives outside of work. It's inherently unreasonable for a capitalist whom is taking a large cut of the worker's efforts to expect said worker to forego their own personal needs without extra compensation.


We have minimum wage laws to prevent business owners from exploiting workers to the point where they aren't having their basic needs met. If a business can't survive without paying workers less than what they need to survive, it doesn't deserve to be entertained as a serious proposition anyway. There will almost always be somewhere else an unskilled person could provide enough value to earn a living wage.


As a person who has lived in poverty, I am happy to give up a portion of my wealth and income to try to make the lives of less fortunate people better. Just look at the state of countries that don't have it vs the ones that do.


Yeah and it also provides services and infrastructure without which the society and taxpayer within would cease to survive, a fair trade-off for anybody who can see past their own individual circumstances.
I was actually surprised he didn't advocate for the abolition of child labour laws. The fact is there are less people (per capita) living in extreme poverty than ever before and it's still improving.

to piggyback off this i've found the ccxt library useful if you want to do it programatically because it standardises all of the api calls to different exchanges...
