Bitcoin serves as a gold alternative.  It has a fixed, clearly defined supply growth rate and it's value trends upwards (over the long term) in a way that is decorrelated from the stock and bond markets.  
It is currently utilized as a gold alternative by many Chinese investors already and I expect the field of investors to grow as the time during which bitcoin "has not collapsed to $1" grows.
Bitcoin's practical uses in processing ransom transactions, purchasing illegal items and facilitating online gambling create a price floor in the same way that gold's industrial/jewelry uses do.
I am not banking on, nor do I expect, revolutionary mass adoption.  I would be very happy if something like this does happen and I probably won't be as surprised as most if it happens.  However, if investing in bitcoin was an all or nothing proposition where the bitcoins are worthless without some kind of revolution, I wouldn't have invested in them.

Yeah, but these kind of crashes have happened like 50 times before and it's always recovered. If it didn't recover this time, that would be the first of 50. If something happens 50 times in a row without exception, you start to develop a level of confidence in it happening again.

1000 people own a third the bitcoins because they got in when they were selling for cents.
The system doesn't "give" the miners bitcoins. New bitcoins are given to miners in exchange for processing transactions and the rate at which they are distributed is determined by an algorithm contained in an open source code that everyone can view. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:50:09
Bitcoin went from $2 to $30 and back to $2 at one point.
At another point, it went from $200 to $1100 in less than a month before going into a multi year bear market with a minima of $200.
This has happened before. In fact there is at least a 25% drop in January every single year.

I sold half my bitcoins and all my bitcoin cash. I'm taking profits and moving them to lower risk investments while keeping my exposure. That's what anyone who makes 70x+ on an investment should be doing. Sell half so you guarantee yourself the windfall in case something catastrophic happens. The effect of people doing this is a short term dip which is normal.

That would be 5% of the market cap of gold. I don't think bitcoin deserves to compete with the full market cap of gold until a long period of low volatility is established which will take a long time.
In order for bitcoin to compete with credit cards, the transaction fee needs to come down. I'm not working this into my predictions until the network becomes more efficient.
FYI: I don't think bitcoin needs to compete with/be used like credit cards to be valuable. It'll asymptotically approach gold in it's current form.

Neither Charlie Munger nor Warren Buffett practice speculation (buying things without earnings with the expectation that they will go up in value) and have criticized gold as well which makes them consistent in their criticism. Bitcoin is valued for basically the same reasons as gold so I'm not surprised they wouldn't like it. They'll both miss the boat on this and continue to make billions buying undervalued companies (shedding no tears). 
However, I did like Warren Buffett's witty retort on this. A reporter cited a comment from Charlie Munger from five years ago when the price was $100 (that's what the reporter said) where he claimed that bitcoin was rat poison and asked Warren Buffett if, given that bitcoin had appreciated to $10,000, he still thought that. His response: no, now I think it's rat poison squared ($100^2=$10,000).

An approval from the SEC would drive up the price of bitcoin, but drive down the premium that GBTC sells for.  Currently, GBTC sells for significantly more than the market rate for bitcoin.  There is no reason to pay the premium for GBTC is the Winklevoss ETF is approved which would make the market rate for bitcoin go up and the delta between GBTC and the market rate for bitcoin go down.

The approval is not a given.  There are currently lots of bets being placed for/against its approval.

The ETF world have made a positive difference, but Bitcoin has been existing without ah ETF Ave will continue to do just fine without one. 
If Ah ETF allowed lots of large funds easier access to bitcoins,it would have a positive effect on the price of Bitcoin similar to the effect of the first gold ETF on gold, but bigger in magnitude due to the fact that Bitcoin is a less mature asset.

Yes, the largest holders of Bitcoin, and the drivers of its value, currently are wealthy Chinese individuals who want a hedge against Chinese inflation and a method to quickly move their money out of the country. 
As tensions grow between the US and China during the Trump administration and bond yields soar (China relies heavily on borrowing, higher bond yield=higher interest rate on new Chinese debt), demand for Bitcoin will soar. If a Winklevoss ETF is approved, it would make it easier for large institutional investors to piggyback on the China driven growth which would create a multiplier effect.

I'm not sure, I don't remember.
If they're already going to sleep with you, why would you buy them a drink?  Seems like a waste of money...

This has happened to bitcoin before. Us battle hardened holders have been here before and are super rich for having not sold. Should you buy? Well, you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose, but it's cheaper than it has been and isn't really any different than before.

The point of Paypal, initially, was to create a non-government internet currency.  That's what him, Musk &amp; others were trying to do.  To say that this is just a pump and dump doesn't make any sense to me.  Do you think Tim Draper was just executing a pump and dump?  What about Mike Novogratz?  What about the Winklevoss Twins?  Why did no one accuse them of ill intentions?
Also: Vitalik Buterin was funded by a Thiel Fellowship to work on the Ethereum project

This assumes that the volatility is predictable. If you can predict the volatility swings, good for you. I hope you make lots of money on your predictions. Years ago, I thought I could predict the volatility swings, I put my money on the table and lost it (not all of it, just some of it). My impression is that the short term swings are inherently chaotic ( and that trading these is zero sum minus trading fees. 
Value investing, on the other hand (buying undervalued assets and waiting), is not zero sum and is far less susceptible to chaos. I've had much better experiences with this kind of investing.

They're spooked because Goldman's trading branch (which has been on point so far this year) called ~$4800 the peak so a sudden drop appears to be prophetic.  The prediction guides the behavior that makes the prediction *temporarily* true. The ICO ban was the catalyst that set off the reaction. 
Those of us that understand the true value of bitcoin beyond regular price patterns (Elliot Waves) understand that the "true value" will propel the price upwards regardless of what happens in the short term.
From a technical, short term, trading standpoint, this is a local peak. From a value based, long term perspective, bitboin has a long way to climb.

This is the tribalism I was referring to.
Did I vote for Trump?  No, but why should I have to disclose that before giving my opinion? Does that make any sense?  Do you need to know who I voted for to determine whether or not my arguments are valid?
What I'm seeing on this website is that there's a herd all moving in one direction where most members are not capable of independent critical thinking and all those who stand outside the herd are disregarded as inferior regardless of their credentials and attributes.
If someone steps outside the crowd and successfully argues difficult positions, I respect them more than someone who mindlessly follows the crowd and believes without thinking even if the person following the crowd ends up being right (by accident).
If you look at this guy's credentials, there's no way you can call him an moron with any level of intellectual honesty:

My point is that the level of negativity toward Peter Thiel when it became known that he had invested in crypto was not expressed when Tim Draper, the Winklevoss twins and Mike Novogratz invested.
I think it can be said of Draper, Novagratz, the Winklevoss twins and Thiel that: they all both *believe in the technology* and *are trying to profit*
However, when Draper the Winklevoss twins and Novogratz invested, the narrative was *they believe in the technology*
When it became known that Thiel invested, the narrative was (not universally held) *he's just trying to profit!*

You can't sell those things!  They could be worth $10m next year!  Is it worth $100 for me to buy you a drink?  
lol, I have &gt;$100k in bitcoin so this is me next year.
Also Richard Feynman says that if you want to sleep with a woman, you should never buy her a drink so I never do.

I had 29, I'm drawing my supply down to 21 by mid November at a rate of 0.1 every 2 days.
Then I'm going to sell my B2X coins in a similar fashion followed by my BCH coins when they get deposited in my Coinbase account.  
I'm moving that money into index funds and holding onto 21 (real) bitcoins.  I haven't decided on how I'll draw this amount down, but I'll at least realize a fraction of the % gains at some point next year.
500+% yoy returns are amazing, but can leave you undiversified (not a bad problem to have).  It's important to not have all your eggs in one basket.  If you have, for example, $1M in bitcoins and less than $100k in everything else, it would be smart to sell at least half of those and invest in an index fund.  A lot of posters here have been rewarded handsomely for their bets on crytocurrencies, but we aren't omnipotent; just because we have been correct in the past, doesn't mean we can't be wrong tomorrow.
In the late 90s, a lot of investors assumed that the internet was "the next big thing" and that it would revolutionize the economy.  They were right.  The 5 most valuable companies in the world are computer companies and 3 were created to provide internet services.  A bubble still formed and people lost lots of money.  People that invested in AMAZON.COM lost lots of money.  If you bet, in the 90s, that Amazon.com would rule the world someday, you'd have been right!  And you'd still have lost lots of money!  Investing in Amazon!  This was not at all visible to investors at the time.
TL;DR: Invest in bitcoin, but don't invest &gt;50% of your net worth in it because even if you're right about it's revolutionary nature, you can still get blown up by price swings.  If you invested a small amount that later became &gt; 50% if your portfolio, it would be wise to re-balance.

I tried putting them up for adoption to readopt later at a lower price, but a whale came in and adopted 500 children in 30 minutes creating a short children squeeze and I had to pay out the nose to get them back.

It's not by his definition, it's speculation. So is buying gold which is kind of like buying bitcoin for old people. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:40:43
The point is to put them to work. 
If the value of their labor output exceeds their upkeep cost, they'll easily cashflow. Then, you can use the cashflow to adopt more children. Rinse and repeat.

I haven't bought our sold a Bitcoin since 2015.
Some traders win, some traders lose, no one who bought and held for the long term has lost money on Bitcoin.

Some people who try to time buying and selling bitcoin win, some lose.
Nobody who has bought and held has lost any money on bitcoin.

By calling itself "the new Silicon Valley", Austin has established itself as a follower (not a leader) and aknowledged its current inferiority.
Silicon Valley is the most economically productive place in the United States and has a lot of haters as a result.

...but is it reasonably possible that the worth of the tokens on Coinbase's exchange will be significantly different than the bitcoins on another exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:43:59
So you see them as more of self-serving market controllers/manipulators than oracles.  I get it.
I hold a significant number of bitcoins.  I'm looking at reducing my stake and using the returns to fund the downpayment on a house.  If Goldman can stoke a mini bubble between now and the end of the year, I'd be really happy.

Women are attracted to alpha male type behaviors and status alongside good looks.

@_date: 2017-06-12 01:26:06
Men with high status don't need to be that good looking. 
In the United States, wealth brings status. This is especially in high cost of living areas like Coastal California and NYC.
