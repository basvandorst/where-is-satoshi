Sweet deflection, bro?
Apple, JP Morgan, Chrysler, etc - most of those places had *more* than just a name.  They had infrastructure, equipment, skilled employees.
Mt Gox is just a name with a very very poor track record.
Equating Mt Gox to JPMorgan is delusional at best and lieing at worst.

Even with that cynical of an outlook, is more than what is afforded under private regulation.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:25:23
Again, all places which had more than just a name. When all you have is just a name, and it gets tarnished, thats all you're left with - a tarnished name.

The precedent was mybitcoin. I'm sure a quick walk down google will tell you how much of that money was recovered, and how involved any government agencies were.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:20:36
Did they ever catch the mybitcoin thieves?  Was there really like *any* governmental effort put into that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:15:42
Sodomy is illegal in a lot of places too.  But those laws are hard to enforce.
How do you enforce laws on a loss of 1's and 0's in a protocol? 
Probably the same way you enforce laws in other financial areas: regulation.

I insinuated that people shouldn't expect anything different with a prosecution of mtgox than what came about with mybitcoin. You can scream 'theft' all you want.

I don't see a direct connection between the two. If swimming was exercise, kids wouldn't be fat? Kids are fat, therefore swimming is bad?

Oh, only   He must not know shit then.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:46:38
I don't get it. Half or the bitcoin crowd hates regulation, the other half wants it.  Without regulation and you have what you have now, and with regulation you're better off with Fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:48:35
Who, but the government, do you want to implement rules and failsafes?  Or were you speaking rhetorically?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:31:06
Did that happen with mybitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:08:56
Oh great all the bitcoins are back?! Congratulations!
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:13:36


Wouldn't that depend on the laws their location? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:07:31
I was unaware that Mt Gox was bound to the same laws that affect 'real' trading. Infact, I thought Mt Gox wasn't bound to any US law since they were based out of Japan.  Though my knowledge of bitcoin has grown fuzzy.

No company is going to tank the reputation of a brand to get a 'fresh start' on things.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:03:33
Because everyone still associates the swastika with peace, right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:36:50
I think the price then was ~$30.
I have a precedent of when a shitton of bitcoins were stolen, nothing happened.  You're hoping that something will happen this time, with absolutely nothing backing up that hope.  You can't say "NO REGULATION!" and then beg for enforcement when shit hits the fan.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:29:10
Oh man, you'll surely show me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:55:11
Wait, turns out this is old news, and has nothing to do with gox losing all your bitcoins, 
I'd like my humble pie served to me heated with a side of coffee, please.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:22:25
You severely underestimate how the public generalizes things.
Email has been around for decades.  If Gmail went under, it'd rock a *lot* of things, but email would still be around.
Bitcoin doesn't have the luxury of being engrained in the publics mind.  But instead of losing mail, you're losing **money**.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:47:43
I find it a stretch to say 'most did not' when the *largest* exchange has a ton of missing bitcoins.  And whats $100m in investment when far more of that was just stolen?  It's absurd to suggest that people dissuaded from trying a cryptocurrency are in the minority. Having all your money stolen by a company in japan with absolutely no recourse isn't something that'll just 'fade'.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:22:32


That just seems too emotionally charged to do justice to what's being talked abut.  "People with weapons" has been the *only* way to enforce anything on society for as long society has been around.
Now don't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from with the solutions you're suggesting.  But reliance on those won't come from a technical prowess, it'll have to be a global paradigm shift - to where the threat of *bigger* people with *bigger* weapons is no longer needed.
I don't know much of anything about the items you suggest. What I do know if someone has a big gun and wants your money, they're gonna find a way to get it. That'll always be the case.  What it comes down to is what happens *after* that. Unless there's a way to create new bitcoins and restore them to people, you have to actually track down a person or a specific file with the key for the wallet containing the bitcoins.  People want people with guns protecting their money, and a way to get their money back if its stolen.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:02:22


That worked out so well with mybitcoin, right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:04:34
So you have privatized regulation over public regulation?  That just makes it easier to bribe/influence auditors. You're left with the same problems and added vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:24:25


Assuming they're being compensated with bitcoin.  Cash and kidnapping are also motivators.


I can fire them.
