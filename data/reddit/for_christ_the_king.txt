If Bitcoin is soaring, then people would stop using it for trade. Instead, holding it to make money.
When Bitcoin prices are stable or have a slight downward trend, then it will be used as a currency.

Tech savvy billionaires are very excited about Bitcoin.
Billionaires get hit harder than anyone else by inflation and financial regulations.
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:09:44
But if I think my 25 dollars will be worth 30 dollars next month, then I am incentivized to not buy something. And if the vendor thinks it will be worth 20 dollars next month, he is incentivized not to hold BTC. That mismatch will stop us from doing business.
Stability or predictable inflation is very valuable because it ensures everyone is on the same page for worth.

Square can't just convert crypto to dollars. They need to find buyers. Either by using someone else's exchange or privately buying option contracts.
Either way, there is going to be a delay between the merchant purchase and the conversion, which is where volatility is an issue.

There is still a risk someone hacks the custodian's network. To make it even safer, the custodian could store all the Bitcoins in cold storage and instead hand out a new currency which is guaranteed by these Bitcoins.
This would also solve the price instability, as our custodian could adjust the number of Bitcoin-dollars to deal with it.

Banning isn't a "stage". Its something that can happen at any point when the government feels threatened.
Much larger markets than Bitcoin have been banned before.
@_date: 2019-02-04 06:39:13
To take a recent example, the price of Bitcoin dropped 10% over 12 hours January 9th-10th. There is a lag between your purchase with crypto and conversion to cash. So the payment processor needs to either delay your purchase until the crypto conversion has cleared or charge a big fee as insurance against volatility. This is of course on top of the regular Bitcoin transaction fees(which can be quite significant).
This is ultimately what convinced Valve to drop Bitcoin. Payment processing needs to be predictable above all else.
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:00:12
Standards can change though. IE was the standard for a very long time. Why switch? Because a program with other features came along that did it better.
And thats in addition to regulatory risk if a government decides to ban one currency.

Much more likely scenario would be an international ban on crypto deals a significant blow to Bitcoin.

By contrast, steal 100k in bitcoins and you can safely launder the money and get off scott free.

Depending on local laws, if the transaction is over a certain amount then you do have to keep records of the identity of the purchaser.


The same way cash tax evaders are caught. Government offer employees 50% of the money if they snitch on their employer. Or they catch the employee on an unrelated crime and he snitches to avoid jail time.
Alternately, the employee just cleans out your illegal anonymous wallets and you can't do anything about it without admitting your crimes to the cops.

For a real example, lets say your property is worth 200k and you own 800k in properties total. This 200K property will cost you 50K a year to own. It would cost your tenant(who presumably owns no property) 0 dollars in tax to own. As such, no tenant isn't going to pay you 50K a year for the place.
This is assuming you meant your property tax is tied to the person and you aren't doing something completely crazy like giving each individual property its own progressive tax.

So lets look at this freelance developer. 
He has his bitcoins saved up(presumably 300k+ worth so he can ride out the 7 year debt collection time). Now he takes out 30k or so in loans(not getting more than that without collateral). This is a nice bonus, but not life changing.
In return, he can't own any nice property(house, car, computers, furniture, etc). Because [his creditors can take that.]( Even renting will be tough due to terrible credit and hidden income. He can't even contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax savings, because [that can be taken by creditors too.]( That sounds like a really bad deal for our developer.
And thats if things go well for him. If things go badly, he gets prosecuted for fraud and better hope he didn't make any mistakes the police can find.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:11:07

Social Security relies on tracking income, which crypto could prevent.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:24:36
If we are going back to the good old days, don't forget about physical goods. Tariffs, excise taxes, etc. And poll taxes.
Of course, these taxes tend to collect much less as they are regressive, so we may have to cut welfare, Social Security and medical spending.

Most likely because you didn't have much money. Technically, you can "beat" the system by having no money to sue for.
But if you just refuse to pay debt back and try to hide your money, the system will treat you very harshly.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:12:48
You can already pull all your cash out of the bank and hide it. The government will almost never bother to track it down.
The law can still seize your property, take a percent of your wages or just stick you in jail until you surrender these Bitcoins to the court.

The strategy proposed was 


This doesn't work if he is judgment-proof. He would need an income and possessions that give him access to credit. These are all things your creditor can go after.
The judge could even demand he sell off those Bitcoins to raise money and hold him in contempt of court(jail) until he complies.
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:41:11


I would never store money in a bank that could do that.

Only one who loses out is you.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:29:22
You can still tax physical goods and privileges(property tax, tariffs, excise tax, driving tax, etc).
Tends to make less money though as these taxes are much more regressive.

Most things you pay people for are very traceable though.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:20:22
The issue with extremely high property taxes is they reduce the value of property, which cuts the income of the tax. If property taxes were set at 15-35%, wealthy people would sell as much of their US property as they could and instead buy property overseas. We could easily see property values drop over 50%, and if you raise property taxes further to compensate, they just drop even more.
A secondary impact of your plan would be bankrupting a lot of people who currently have mortgages and sparking a depression that makes 2008 look mild.
