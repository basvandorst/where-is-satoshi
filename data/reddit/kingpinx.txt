Uber requires TLC plates (taxi and limo commision) which require commercial / livery insurance. so they do have insurance. 


taxi licenses don't require training, if you mean medallions they require payment. used to be upto 1 million. now much less.
If you mean the tlc license aka chauffeur's license aka hack license, then both cabs and uber need this. 
and yes uber is taking a lot of business away from cabs and limo companies, having worked with the largest black car / limo group in NYC + having managed an auto repair shop part time which owned a few medallions, I say its about time things got shook up. Uber may not be the final answer but the status quo was really bad for all sides but the business owners, both the drivers and passengers got screwed one way or the other in many cases before uber.
