Bitmain don't care.  They are currently sitting around $100/TH for the S9 and this will probably be $110/TH.
They want everyone to think difficulty has stalled out, then they will just keep dropping prices until its $25/TH and ROI for early buyers is never...

$300 for a 1300W supply?  Seems a bit steep/top end retail.  Yeah I get it, can run 220V and then be 2600W but that kinda removes it from the "home" category in the USA!  Especially since Bitmains prior PSUs are pretty crappy in reality, its been proven time and time again they just aren't very efficient or good.
Grabbing a new 1300W EVGA for $150 off eBay is a much better deal!

Yeah I think COLD STORAGE is what makes Coinbase worthwhile.  They also were the first to create the "vault" concept to add a time-lock for users, which is pretty neat.
At first I thought Bitcoin would never work because everyone is bound to get hacked eventually.  But then I realized that is just another computer science problem to be solved, there are ways of engineering a large portion the risk out of the system.  And that is the challenge Bitcoin brings to us!
Requiring a human step to access cold storage really is a last line of defense, but a completely necessary one, as Bitfinex has showed!

Sure, the problem becomes you assume it's sustainable to run that way.  Bills catch up with everyone eventually!
Even the big operators have to shut down once their cost of production is consistently above the cost to buy a coin on the open market.  They can only hold out so long.
I mean that's what happened to Cointerra in 2015.  They had 4 MegaWatts of power contracted from a big datacenter provider and when they failed to pay the bill after 2 months of being behind they went dark... And that was an ASIC manufacturer - you don't get chips cheaper than that!  (though they obviously overpaid for hosting, Chinese warehouse hosting is much cheaper than a *real* datacenter!)

But German power plans are likely better designed more like the US plants, and can better contain any meltdown situation.

LOL "What *I* don't understand"...  How many different nanometer miners have you owned?  I did 110nm, 65nm, 55nm, 28nm.
Guess what?  Nanometers aren't the end-all-be-all.
For example, the KnC's 28nm "Jupiter" was 1.4 watts per gigahash.
The 28nm AntMiner S7 is around 0.25 watts per gigahash!  That is a ~6x increase in efficiency in the same nanometer size!
So it will take a while for 14/16nm to become the "norm", then simply by designing a better chip new designs will blow old designs out of the water - even with the same nanometers.
*"That's why anyone buying a current generation miner that has cheap enough electricity should and will run it for at least the next few years until we move to 12nm/10nm."*  That may be true at the end of 14/16nm designs.  At this point however the BW chip is actually equal efficiency-wise to the 28nm Antminer S7!  So at this point the BW chip is a loser.

Authors POV:
*"My personal stance on the Bitcoin front is that I'm OK with segwit, but this uses up Bitcoin's lifetime allotment of clever hacks -- any additional complexity will relegate Bitcoin into the same category as telco switch code."*
That is what gets me about this whole debate.  Are we really saving that much space for the required additional complexity?  I mean this will mean we have a regular block and a segwit block that both have to propagate (realistically speaking).  No way the overall size of both blocks combined is any smaller just keeping Bitcoin as it is today and making the max 2mb.
SegWit in a lot of ways is the antithesis of KISS, here's to hoping it works!

Change the wallet to be BTC, always compare BTC to BTC.
You probably specified your wallet as USD which means they converted BTC/USD (1% fee) and then the price changed a little too perhaps?
I hate that Coinbase/Circle now keep two different kinds of books and it's confusing to users.  Especially when it used to work one way then one day they popup a box saying "Would you like to switch to USD" and if you clicked YES all of a sudden you don't have BTC anymore at all, you just have a USD amount that is fixed and you convert it at market price to BTC when you actually spend it.

So wait, let me get this straight.  You sent 16.9362 to Coinbase, received 16.9362 BTC, then converted it USD and are complaining about the puny 1% fee because you "cant expose (your) money to that kind of volatility!"?
Nevermind.  I see why Circle/Coinbase had to change their behavior now.  You aren't using Bitcoin, you are using a USD transfer service that has low fees because it uses Bitcoin under the hood.  If you did that with PayPal this would read "$250 fee to send $7100 to my account". LOL

Yep, scum - they will still talk to you if you have deep pockets: 
"BW did not announce a date as to when the public sale will commence, but **customers looking to place large volume orders are still more than welcome.**"
However as an actual miner speaking here, what matters more is the efficiency of the chip.  BW's new 14nm chip is actually pretty much equal (efficiency wise) to the existing 28nm AntMiner S7, so the reality is BW's chip is a loser right out of the gate!

You would see wild swings in hashrate for summer vs winter for sure!
The thing is, if its profitable to mine people will do it regardless of the season.  
**Why turn off a profitable miner?**  This is where the idea breaks down!   There is only a small window where you would consider "mining at a loss" just to enjoy the heat.
And if you don't believe me, well I have some AntMiner S1s and original BitFury's laying around you can have for the cost of shipping and you can see how much fun it is to run "less than profitable" equipment just for heat!

Yeah but the BTC OP is just plain wrong:
*"Unless you're mining with crazy expensive electricity, your current generation miner will either pay off eventually, or Bitcoin will go to 0.  There's no purpose in turning it off."*
No the way this works is AS LONG AS YOU CAN MAKE A PROFIT you keep mining.  As soon as it costs you $1.10 worth of power to make $1.00 worth of Bitcoins, you STOP MINING.
Why would any miner pay 10% over market price for coins?  This is coming from a miner since 2011 that has many generations of equipment still at home, most were sold to suckers on eBay once obsolete but some are just collecting dust because the cost to ship outweighs the market value.
Miners fail to reach ROI a lot, my worst investment was 100BTC on on an Avalon Batch 3 that only returned around 50BTC.  Oh well, others got burned for much, much more!

Meh, I like how two people can look at the same data and come to completely different conclusions.
A hardfork to 2mb or 4mb could happen quickly with classic.  And Segwit could be better done as a hardfork anyway.
Core @ 6x?  Yeah maybe by 2018!
But what would be even better is for everyone to just get along.  Personally if you MUST hardfork, I don't see the issue in doing it sooner rather than later.  That is the issue that never made sense to me with Core.  I'd rather hit it head-on than prance around the issue.  Bitcoin survived the past forks, it will survive the next one!
@_date: 2016-04-22 22:55:49
Good read.  But it seems to be missing one big point:
Miners create the blocks, thus they indeed *run* the network.  *Market forces* will keep miners inline, but that's it!
Miners only want to mine rewards on the longest chain that is accepted as gospel on the network, while wallets and exchanges just have to have their transactions included in the next block which is created by the miners.
It's really a symbiotic relationship.  **The whole argument is essentially which is more important, the chicken or the egg?**   When in reality I would say that debate is pointless, as you don't have one without the other!
What a happens if miners choose a different path than wallets and exchanges?  That really is the question here.  Consensus has to be reached or ultimately Bitcoin will fail.

@_date: 2016-04-12 00:41:47
What happened is this -  Coinbase says:
"Just a 1% fee for each transfer from bitcoin to your local currency"  
So you received BTC then converted it to USD.  So if BTC went to $845 tomorrow you would still have $7100 but only 8-ish BTC in the account!  In that theoretical situation if you had kept it as BTC then that would be $14k!
  ^(Of course the opposite is also true, if BTC goes down versus the dollar then you get more BTC)

As a miner since 2011 already having been through one of these, the grass is NOT greener on the other side as far as profits go!
There really isn't a ton of uncertainty on what kind of reward miners will get afterwards, we all know that we have the equivalent of a 200% difficulty adjustment looming...
Considering the only viable/available miner right now is the S7 and it is extremely overpriced, no surprise things are slowing down.  But we still had that 20% bump in Feb which was brutal, especially when most miners were hoping for 3-6% average.

Actually less in a lot of cases when power is considered.
I mined with GPUs.  I've actually lost quite a bit of BTC mining since ASICs hit, but thats what happens when the order Avalon's second ship date  that only returned 50BTC when I paid them 100BTC!  Why did that happen?  The chips were sold to their buddies out the back-door and my ship date was "delayed" over two months... Fuck Yifu!  Of course BFL (the US-competitor) proved ultimately to be scammers so YMMV!
Bitmain overtook Avalon as the premier Chinese ASIC supplier with the vastly superior S1.  Every chip of theirs since has been superior to any competitors when it comes to hashes per watt output.
But they do have ROI figured out.  I bought a batch one S7 for 6+BTC when it first released, knowing it may not return that but I wanted to upgrade.  *Sonofabitches* they eventually were selling "batch 28" or whatever for 0.3 BTC or less!

BAMBOOZLE ALERT!
Miner since 2011.  I can explain exactly what happened here.  While this guy theoretically could have found a block on slush, that isn't what actually happened here.  
He found the block on a SHA-256 altcoin mined @ thecoin.pw as shown in the screenshot.  Note thecoin.pw doesn't even mine Bitcoin, but just one of seventeen SHA-256 alts.   And all those ALTs are very obscure with basically no hashpower and short block times, so they are all very easy to mine on.

You are an idiot.  NiceHash is essentially one of the largest hashpower rent/buy/sell organizations.  Many people who mine got paid out once per week or so because IT COSTS MONEY on the Bitcoin network to cash out every single day.
Mining is a 24/7 thing.  You can't just "stream" the earnings to your own wallet 24/7.  That is simply just not how pooled mining works.  This is essentially like one of the largest pool operators getting owned - but you don't see them because the hashes ultimately get put on whatever pool the "rentee" wants.  Some alt coins lost 90% of their hashpower today!

I guess I was more aligned with Gavin's vision of "scale all the ways" and was really disappointed when Core forced him out.

I see your point and we can't predict the future but there is one thing I have to say we do know for sure out of OP's statements that is an actual fact at this point:


We actually know this is EXACTLY the case.   Humans have fundamental issues really comprehending exponential growth/numbers.  I admit I had this problem at first also.  I mined coins for $3 and sold them for $6.  A friend set me straight and explained how Bitcoin was only going to become more rare, and eventually this had to impact the price.  This would be the first time we see "Moores Law" type of innovation and acceleration being applied/extended into the financial space.  
And you know what?  To this point that has been completely correct.  Single digit bitcoins.  Double digits.  Triple digits.  Now we are sitting at 5 digits!
So far, *"Bitcoin is just so different that it's actual value is actually rising exponentially"* is a completely true statement.  Now it doesn't mean we can use that to predict the future and say definitively it will remain that way forever, but it is a true statement so far, and I see no reason for that general trend to change, in fact all indicators are this will continue for quite some time.  Of course there will be ups and downs, but humans are just now for the first time realizing what it means to hold an ultimately deflationary asset.

Hell no, you'll melt the WeMo for sure over the long-run!    They just aren't made for that kind of power draw over long periods of time.   It may work for a while, but still a bad idea!  I don't put S9 rigs on anything less than a 20A circuit @ 110/120V as even a 15A leaves too little headroom really be comfortable.  Like my PSUs, I run all my mining rigs at 50-60% power load max, just to prevent issues.  So a WeMo like that I'd be comfortable at around 7A draw or maybe 800W.
Curious, what is your power rate(s)?

@_date: 2015-12-08 21:37:03
The problem:
The difference between the offical (government-determined) exchange rate and the black-market (cambio paralelo) is currently around 800-1000%. 
So while it looks like 1.7M/week, that really equates to only $170K!
More from the tripadvisor article I was reading about Venezuela:
" The prices in the stores of almost all goods and services are based on the parallel exchange rate (because most things are imported and have been paid for with dollars or euros that the importer has bought on the black market). So a 32" TV is priced at 15000BFs (Bolivars Fuertes). At the offical dollar exchange rate of 6.3BFs = 1US$ this would be about USD$1000. In reality, using the current parallel exchange rate of about 60BFs the TV costs the equivalent of USD$250 - about the same as in the USA or Europe. If the official exchange rate was the same as the market (parallel) rate, the TV should only cost 250X 6.3 = 1575 BFs. Of course the average Venezualan doesn't have dollars or euros to exchange unless they have family abroad, so many things are simply unattainable because of this parallel pricing. The minimum salary and pension is around 3000BsF/month, so it would take the average worker five monthly salaries to pay for the 32" TV. "

Then bitcoin hit like $40/coin and he was like "no way this is overvalued" and he liquidated it all at that price the way up.

Anyone who watched the Google youtube video on poisonous developers will recognize this right away - "go code it yourself" is a stonewall tactic.
The problem here is while POOLS choose what code to run, individual miners do not.   Slush's XT vote was never a worthwhile experiment because of the DOS attacks.  Thus "hiding" votes from the attackers and doing it at the pool level is the only way.
Here is the deal.  We HAVE lots of solutions.  NONE are getting traction because there is no way to effectively choose just one.  So we are stuck with a Tragedy of the Commons that will not end well.
Since pool operators don't want to be responsible for rocking the boat, let the individual miners choose.  At least then they can feel empowered to push back on this clusterf.

Yes there are concerns, and I realize I do not speak for all users but from the way the votes are cast around here I believe I am in the large majority.  Mostly the concerns were with XT @ 32GB.
There is much less concern about 8mb.  Even the Chinese pools signed onto that.  
The maximum size is just that.  We can soft limit lower if needed.  I watched the last big fork live when BTCG saved the day - the whole time I was thinking "this could be it, then end!"
But I realized after that experience that Bitcoin has just enough balance between decentralization and centralized watchers.  The pool operators have a vested interest in Bitcoin succeeding.  When  push comes to shove they will make it work.
I deal with developers every day.  Some are sharp as nails, but still wrong at times.  I feel there are serious issues with the Core dev team, and without Galvin Core has lost its way.  Yes XT was probably a bad move, but even then Core didn't get a clue and at this point I don't think they will unless something else changes.

@_date: 2015-06-23 22:35:12
Yeah, TL;DR:
"Bigger blocks propagate slower which results in a higher chance of the block being orphaned."  
Logically pretty much everyone knew this was the case, but now that we have some solid data to back that up maybe this will change the behavior of some pools...  include more transactions to "up the fee" but don't make a block soo big that it loses the race.  I personally think this may have an impact on a pools decision on whether or not to include zero fee transactions.

It really simple guys.  We aren't growing at 35%, 17%, or even 5% anymore.  Why?  The cost to generate a Bitcoin is close to par with its exchange value - within a factor of two at least even for those with cheap power.
You need a chip that is significantly more efficient OR the price to rise if there is going to be hashrate growth.
Avalon ASICS Gen 1 took 10W(!) to generate 1GH.
ANTMINER S1 was 2W /GH  (1.1W/GH underclocked)
ANTMINER S3 was 0.75W/GH
ANTMINER S5 is 0.5W/GH  (Spondoolies is similar)

Nanometers isn't the end-all-be-all of efficiency.  Bitmain does it right, by producing large amounts of inexpensive chips that are hand designed for the best power consumption.
For example KnC's 28nm Jupiter is around 1.5W/GH.
Bitmain's 28nm S3 is around 0.8W/GH.
The new 28nm S7 is 0.25W/GH!

Emotional?  Yes.  But heck, that last link says it all!  They want to avoid the fork, and will do anything to keep 1MB.  Their solution instead is segregated witness.
Core concludes a fork is too risky.  So they take a round-about way to hack in functionality.  I actually see that as more of a risk long term in a lot of ways.  KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) method is almost always the best solution in code.
XT's voting mechanism provides a way for miners to gracefully "ease in" the fork.  Even Satoshi said this was a temporary limit to be removed later, and instead Core gets cold feet and sticks their head in the sand!

I think you guys are missing the point.  The whole idea of Bitcoin is based on trusting the math in the decentralized nature of the system which prevents corruption.  Who really cares who got the mining lottery this 10 minutes?  It has to be mathematically correct and verified by all.
Banks will NOT get into mining at this point because its simply:
Power(read: $) spent == Hashes.  Where does it stop?  What is "enough" hashing power to feel comfortable?  50% of the network?
Banks like high-tech secured data-centers.  Overhead on that is extremely high compared to the massive swap-cooled with exposed-wire Chinese datacenters.

THIS IS THE RIGHT ANSWER.
We have always had zero transactions blocks.  They generally only happen because of this exact issue, you don't want to lose out on 25BTC because you waited another half minute to broadcast your own block waiting for all the housekeeping on the last block and your own mempool.

No one can explain how a 11.95BTC loan became 64.74BTC or how the they keep the same ratio on the fiat numbers?
Seems like BTCJam must have kept all debts in USD or other fiat, then with the decrease in BTC price and added fees it could make sense.
Problem is then the $67,800 figure in the article is bogus as it uses peak prices and should be closer to $16K.

But you didn't tell anyone what you concluded.  That info would be very interesting or nice to know for others to avoid your same fate.  Unfortunately you can't tell anything from a bitcoin address or transaction, unless the people responsible volunteer proof of ownership of the address.  This becomes more possible if the transaction gets linked to a known exchange wallet destination or something similar.
Your unwillingness to provide any other info about the circumstances to those who could perhaps help just shows you do not seem to want actual help with this, alas there is nothing that can be gained from the information provided.

The blocksize was originally 32MB and just reduced to 1MB to keep requirements light when the network was tiny.  
So whats better?  4x?  8x?  32x?  20MB is rather arbitrary but meh, simply changing the max is the most straightforward change.

Exactly.  One fork wins, the other dies.  The pool operators will go to whichever version they see as winning very, very quickly as they are unable to risk any loss.
The key I think you are getting at is what if the miners choose a different fork than say the payment processors?  My point is that really doesn't matter, whichever fork is deemed "winning" everyone will convert over to it ASAP (even if they disagree with that fork as the outcome, they are forced to switch - both miners and payment processors) - the miners will be the first movers thus making the "losing" chain quickly obsolete and unable to find any new blocks for hours/days/years perhaps.

Nothing *fundamentally* breaks at 2-4-8mb.  Anything else is FUD.  Pool operators can soft limit lower, even if a problem was discovered at a higher size.  This whole debate is FUD.

Actually is pretty clear in my book.  The Great Firewall of China likes to sever connections randomly mid-stream, and the likelihood of a 20MB or 32MB transfer being cut off in the middle requiring a re-transmit is much greater than a 8MB block.

Hey your article is much better than most all of the crap we see written about bitcoin!  (like yesterday:  "pgp keys" protecting Satoshi's BTC?   Just wow...) 
But I have to ask:  What do you plan on putting in the "downsides" on the version 2 article?
Hopefully you could shed some perspective on the developer infighting and how something as simple as removing what was designed as a temporary SPAM limit cap by satoshi (1MB) has caused great consternation.  I mean the fact we have certain Core Developers thinking "1MB is already too big" yet we are already hitting the cap repeatedly just shows how out of touch some are!
Maybe also something else about the Chinese influence since they own the chip fabs run most of the mining pools that are popular?
Oh even better yet, all the [score hidden] nonsense around here these days, I would label certain forum admins as a threat also!  Mass censorship campaigns in regards to an open source software project is definitely a gem!

If f2 was constantly producing zero blocks that is one thing.  But considering they are the most popular pool (and for good reason too: rare PPS mining with 4% fee allows for reliable guaranteed 96% payouts for miners) I think the occasional zero block while annoying really isn't a big deal.

Bitcoin is backed by the math, physics, and the laws of the universe.  Essentially it boils down to the commodity of the computing power it takes to mine the coin and run the network (ultimately silicon and electricity).
If you think the intrinsic value of sliver/gold is anything near the current prices for them, well that's simply wrong and the driver for those prices is investor sentiment.
Bitcoin IS gold, just with a scarce digital commodity that can't be faked instead of a physical commodity with all the drawbacks therein.

@_date: 2015-06-18 18:22:09
Are we also grateful to the Chinese pools that all of a sudden decided 8MB was their *signed off* proposal?
Personally I think this is getting ridiculous.  Without significant re-coding 32MB is the practical max and the limit Bitcoin started with, but pools can always choose to limit their own individual blocks lower.  Why would we even really choose 8MB vs 20MB vs 32MB?
Anything lower than 32MB just means the *next* required hardfork comes that much sooner.  And I understand the technical complexity concerns with the miner voting proposals or the auto-max-size based on previous blocks.  
But to arbitrarily choose 20 or 8 based on gut feel and compromise because it's between 1 and 32 is just asinine.
How about I create my own proposal?  Lets make the max 4MB now then double it every reward halving until it gets to 32MB (i.e. so we get 8MB next year).  All the code for that should be rather easy to implement (unlike some other proposals here...)

There is a certain amount of "lost in translation" between here China.  This is where a lot of the problems lie in actually getting things done.
  Some one from the 1% you reference has really hoodwinked them into backing off on taking any action, and by default that means 1MB/RBF. 
Heck even the Lightning network calls for an eventual 135mb blocksize.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:17:52
I guess I should have stated "artificial" instead of "soft".  32MB is based on the way the code operates, 1MB was artificially imposed later on.
32MB is a pretty hard limit today:
"There is a 32MB limit to the size of messages in the protocol.  At the moment, blocks have to fit in a single protocol message.  Going past 32MB blocks would mean a protocol change of some kind.  Maybe blocks could be split over multiple messages."

@_date: 2015-06-18 18:57:40
Actually thats not quite true, as I understand it, because 32MB was the original limit and all code/variables/etc expected that upper bound, with 1MB being a "soft" (sorry *artificial*) limit below added after the fact.
All the talk of 8 or 20 is just changing that 1MB artificial limit variable in one place in the code.   Anything over 32MB requires a lot more code changes.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:20:48
And you do?  Please expand on your thought.  I am here to be enlightened:
This is consensus.  You really only need 51% and the rest will follow.  Yes hashing power can move between pools, but that is why "in-pool" voting is really needed.  This would also set a precedence for future protocol change votes.

This argument is asinine.  MINERS CREATE THE BLOCKS, WITHOUT THEM THERE WOULD BE NO BITCOIN.  They simultaneously have "all the power" by creating blocks but "no real power" in the sense they have competition from other miners and have to go with the flow (rules of the network) to get their work accepted.

LMAO - its EVEN WORSE!   Using an Antminer S9 and a CHEAP power rate of $0.07/KWH the Antminer will burn $2/day in power to make $3.50 in Bitcoin.    
If you have a power rate of 10 cents/KWH power cost is closer to $2.90 so you're only making $0.60/day and spending basically 5x that on the power cost!!!
You need $0.03/KWH power, or at least 5 cents or less to really run gear these days!

Make a BTC savings plan.  Stick to it.
I found this "bitcoin" thing back in 2011.  Mined nearly 1000 bitcoins with GPUs.  Sold most coins $6-10 because I thought I was "stimulating the economy" and used it as play money mostly.
Had a buddy saying "you are an idiot, save save save!" and I just laughed it off... it was just magic internet money after all!   (even in those days!)
He's now a USD millionaire in BTC but the best part is HE WOULD NEVER TELL ANYONE and not even the US Govt has a way to know until he were to "cash out".  Me?  I'm holding a small fraction (4%) of what I mined and bought few things along the way but I can't just retire any day I choose!

The previous revoked certificate was a GoDaddy "wildcard" cert for *.btc-e.com
Right now I am seeing a valid thawte cert for simply btc-e.com (valid 7/2012 - 7/2014)
Its rather trivial to have multiple certificate providers.  Obviously BTC-E messed up their wildcard GoDaddy cert somehow (easy to do when renewing if not careful) and has reverted to an older thawte cert.  If I had to guess we will see the GoDaddy cert back soon all fixed up, especially since wildcards are useful and the thawte cert is old...

Its sad to say, but as a former miner on Deepbit back in 2011-2012 there is always a slight advantage to being on the largest pool.  You get the least amount of variance, and sometimes stuff happens and you just get lucky (smaller pools go offline, get DDoS'd, etc).
I use BTCGuild today, and back when THEY were the 51% threat (60GH Avalons anyone?) and the 3-6month pool luck was always around 103%.  Now that GHash is bigger BTCG has fallen to about 94% luck!
So YES mining with the largest pool IMNSHO is a 10% boost.  But I can't in good faith recommend or trust GHash, especially with the Bitcoin Network going primetime.

Except there is no way they are paying anywhere near $1K/TH.  Think about it this way:  two ANTMINER S3s do almost a TH and are a little bit over half a BTC each - long story short retail would be around $500/TH and you can BET with the connections these guys probably get it for half of that cost or less!
Think of it this way:  You are buying hardware direct from the factories that make these things extremely cheap.  ANTMINER S1s early on sold for over $4K each, and dropped to a couple hundred bucks just recently.  The "cost" to actually make the units is less than that latter number...

Except LOCALBITCOINs IS a form of ESCROW!
All forms of Bitcoin Escrow at this point are subject to this flaw as once you release escrow there is no further guarantee.
Essentially localbitcoins holds your coins in deposit, and you are supposed to confirm receipt of money to them to release the BTC to the buyer.  (just like how if you sent an item they would ask for tracking to confirm)
Problem is, well banks suck sometimes and buyers all act "in a hurry" to get the coins and the buyer provides you with what looks like reasonable proof of deposit (faked receipt) and say your bank is being slow... so you release the coins then find out later SCAM!
The problem is this is happening repeatedly on localbitcoins and there are even stories of the "long con" where a buyer builds up trust by buying smaller amounts then they do a bigger transaction print the receipt and you figure "hey yeah this guy is right all his other transactions have been good I'll just release these coins..." again BAM YOUR SCAMMED!

Good thing they never shipped your item...
I have a very different experience with Overstock and BTC.  I was a "second day" order when they first started accepting BTC.  I ordered two rectangular floor mats, but when they arrived the items were different than pictured (completely different shape - had an additional "tab" intended to go under a desk and would not work for my use as I had exact measurements of the space which matched the advertised dimensions online).
The first rep I talked to was very easy to work with, and told me I could get a refund in BTC or USD or store credit.  I asked if I could just exchange them for the correct item but I was told that is impossible I have to return the ones sent and then re-order the "correct item".  WTF Overstock - I DID order the correct item according to your site!  And then the return story changed: the rep said since this is new payment type I had to go through a different process and someone would contact me next day to finish the return.
Well two days went by, and finally I received an email stating returns are not allowed but they would do me a huge "one-time" favor and allow a return for in-store credit only. WTF 
I also learned from the rep this item had been wrong on the site for some time and "the last 7 returns were for the same issue - wrong item".  Well hello overstock, if this has been returned 7 times for "wrong item" WHY is it still WRONG on the site?  They blamed the drop-shipping company but obviously despite me being return  I don't believe they ever fixed it.  WTF 
In fact the product is still wrong - if you buy this it will not show up as pictured at all:
Overstock doesn't take responsibility when sellers/drop-shippers on their site list stuff incorrectly and wrong items are shipped.  Only BTC refund option given to me was "store credit".  They don't seem to care enough to actually fix it when stuff is completely wrong on their site.

Well it does solve it - although I've heard the story with more than just two generals.  Think of the "plan" as the blockchain.  The general that "finds" the next solution (action/plan of attack) broadcasts that to the other generals and they can all verify cryptographically the solution (action/plan of attack) is correct, agree and move on.
The constraint on bitcoin is it only works if the majority of the hashing power is ran by "trusted" generals.  With that caveat, the Byzantine Generals problem is solved.
----- 
To put it a different way:
Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem. To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: “[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.”
More generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet.
The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.

You have to consider the initial investment and if that has "ROI'd", the power draw required to run the ASICs, and account for regional price differences of power/mining equipment.
For example, with an AntMiner S1s (180GH) the current difficulty and low bitcoin price means it only mines 0.003 BTC per day ($1.29) but costs me around $0.50/day to run @ a low power cost of $0.06/KWH.
Make that $0.12/KWH (more realistic for US average power) and basically by the next difficulty increase in a week the power required to operate the miner is equal to the the bitcoins produced!
Yet the estimated next difficulty increase is still 17% for this period...  That is all new equipment coming online which hasn't ROI'd yet and while the gear is probably something like twice as power efficient there just is no profit left once you have to pay back the cost, mining today is CRAZY!

No at the time it was an issue, you really don't want any one pool &gt; 40% as it just gets too close for comfort.  
But compared to the other operators, BTCGuild's eleuthera is a stand-up BTC guy who has done a stand-up job of pool hosting over the *years*.  (at least when you compare to ghash.io)
So now that BTCG is "in the teens" percentage-wise, I just say Load Em Up With hashes!  With the fee just dropped from 3 down to 2% and the reliability plus regular found blocks make them a great place to mine!

@_date: 2015-05-08 19:33:42


No.  Why?
Even with the newest miners and lowest cost power ($0.06/KWH) it takes roughly $1 in power to make $2 worth of bitcoins (today) in JUST POWER COST ALONE.  (forget space, cooling, internet, etc)
Now imagine your shiny new miner as a 1KW heater.  You run it all day and it costs $1.50 in power.  But you make $3 in BTC.  Well maybe you don't want to make just $3, you want to actually make something worthwhile!
So you get 10 miners.  Oh wait that's a $5000 investment in gear alone?  Hmm.  Oh and 10KW of power?  Ugh.  Now we have to cool that.  Need a new 220V panel, cooling, network, etc.  All done?  Ok neat, how much we making a day?  $15 a day after miner power costs ... minus cooling, oh great $7!  Oh wait we still need to ROI on gear cost and power/cooling installation?  Sorry, you are below zero for a couple YEARS.  But tomorrow new gear with come out making everything obsolete and jacking difficulty up, and your ROI is negative!

Its a bunch of BS, that's what it is.  I'm a miner and there isn't a shred of actual technical information about 21's chip abilities.  Why?
7KW mines me $18/day in BTC with some of the cheapest power in the US and current-gen ASICs running a few TH (TerraHash).  The amount of hashing power 21 is talking about is similar to the 5v USB-stick miners.  Those commonly do 330MH/s (and pretty much require a wall-powered-USB hub!)
So how much BTC does one of those make in a MONTH?  
Answer:  0.00010350 BTC	or $0.02 USD
This doesn't even begin to address the misconception that this somehow helps the bitcoin network.  Full node vs mining node connected to a pool are very different things, and with the worthless horsepower this chip will provide it really doesn't even matter.

The source of the issue lies in the fact that Bitcoin is an Open Protocol that can be used with any compatible software and this particular customer hit a USE CASE that his Bitcoin client software was not optimized for.
In the end its this simple: his Bitcoin client software failed to include a high enough fee and the transaction acceptance was delayed on the network.  Nothing you could do on your end to prevent this one!  
I've done hundreds of transactions, and I only got stuck once - and it was due to a fee issue when running my own client.   This is why using CoinBase or Circle for consumers is actually a good thing versus wallet software on PC/mobile.  First time 'coiners think "naw I don't need a 5 cent fee" and then wonder why the order never happens... *sigh

Seems like as long as a wallet is closed source there will always be the possibility of fckery...  Making sure the random number generator is actually random is only a small part of the deal.
I mean whats to prevent the creator of the wallet from hiding code that could simply upload the private keys of the wallet after a certain date/BTC threshold is met? ^Actually ^now ^that ^I ^think ^about ^it ^BRB... ^making ^a ^Trojan ^wallet!
While I commend the idea, seems like a can-o-worms to me!

Here is a good example for all of you who aren't miners:
The new AntMiner S5 does about 1.2TH with 600W.
So for 6KW of power draw you can have 12TH.  At current difficulty, that would produce a little over 4BTC in a month.
Now power costs @ say $0.07 per KHW (cheaper than most people have) would be about $300 per month ( well 6 * 0.07 * 24 * 30=$302 ).  
Basically it costs ~$75 today with brand spanking new equipment to produce a BTC if you had no overhead costs but power, and free cooling.  Forget about ROI on the equipment cost!
If your chips are older and half that efficient, it probably costs $150 to make a BTC. (cex has older chips)
If you have to cool the miners with A/C tack on another 50% in just power costs.  So now your up to $225 to create a bitcoin in power and cooling alone.  Add rent, data center upkeep, staff, insurance, internet, security, and all of a sudden, $320 for CEX to produce a BTC is about right!

Might be true.  At a low $0.07/KWH power rate, even with the most efficient brand-new mining rigs take $100 in raw power to make a BTC.
So difficulty has to plunge if you want to go sub $150.  Miners generally won't mine for free, or at a loss, so they will either:  
Stop mining, buy coins.
Stop mining, not buy coins
If the price drops and stays under $200 there will be a mining bloodbath which could threaten the network, if only temporarily, with slower confirmations.

But at the same time, if Eternal September hadn't happened we would not be discussing the internet on the internet here today  ;)
This is a necessary progression.  If bitcoin was $10 a coin still would that be the better tradeoff?
Hit mainstream and you have to take the good with the bad...
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:28:33
Here's why:
Have you even used a bitcoin mining calculator?
Just FWIW, @ 10c a KWH the only "profitable" rigs to run will be the newest ASICS (SP20 or Ant S5) and even these you would mine at a loss if BTC drops much below $150. Forget about even making the cost of the miner back!
So lets have you take an S5, that uses only 600W to do about 1.2TH - over the next month you would:
Mine 0.4BTC (worth say $100?) and spend $45 on power. Oh and it sounds like a hairdryer on 24/7. And you need a 800W+ power supply. So if BTC and difficulty stayed the same (hint they wont) you are basically making 0.2 BTC per month! But its going to cost you at *least* 2BTC, probably more like 2.5BTC to get an S5 and PSU together.
One year later, you'll have mined a bit over 2BTC if you payed your power costs, but you would still be in the hole half a BTC because you overpaid for the equipment.

Miner since GPU days here, still have a few TH online.
Some observations:
BTCGuild was the largest pool a couple YEARS ago.  Since then GHash.io took its place and almost hit 51% - but now the Chinese pools are king.
As for "offer miners lower variance" that is EXACTLY what a PPS pool does.  Pay Per Share results in extremely low variance.  f2pool is PPS thus its popularity ( spot) today.  (Most pools are PPLNS, or Pay Per Last "N" Shares which averages out payments based on recent pool luck.)
I have no idea what "insurance" idea you had in mind.  Solo mining is dead unless you have your own large datacenter.   Think about it this way:  10TH takes say 7KW of power draw and on a pool would return about 3BTC per MONTH.   If you tried solo mining it would take nearly a YEAR to get lucky enough to maybe find 1 block.
Pools ARE basically "mining insurance"; ^especially ^when ^a ^miner ^can ^hop ^to ^a ^different ^pool ^anytime ^they ^wish.

The issue is if we crash down to say $75 - No miners can make money.
Will the big farms with $60K/month power bills run at a loss?  No way.
So if you did see $75 coins, the hashrate would probably drop some huge amount, say 90% nearly instantly. Difficulty normally re-adjusts every approx 2 weeks, but the algorithm is actually every 2016 blocks. 
If the hashrate drops and it ends up taking say an hour to find 1 block instead of 10 minutes on average, and you are still only 1 week into a normal 2-week change period, then it could take as long as 6 weeks before things are "back to normal" and the network essentially goes into chaos during that time - most likely a huge movement in price will also correspond to a higher-than-normal volume.

Well that was kind of the whole point of classic.  Core grumbled about 20mb (rightfully so seems consensus).  Core grumbled about 8mb (too arbitrary!).  Core grumbled about 2mb.  Now wait a sec, WHAT?
1mb to 2mb is trivial from a technical standpoint, except for the hardfork aspect and "how to phase it in" (thresholds, etc).  But that is a bridge that does have to be crossed!  Kicking the can down the road, and letting fees climb from a small fraction of a penny up to 5 cents or more per transactions when the network still in early adopter phase really doesn't bode well for what kind of fees Core expects once Bitcoin "takes off"!

Anyway, we were all gamers with Radeon GPUs on our rigs and I convinced the small group of us we should mine for a couple months for extra" spending money".  Why not?  I think between all of us we were pulling in 2-3 coins per day total...  I remember thinking "heck its only 100 coins we saved up" and this "Bitcoin" thing was just a gamble anyway!
Needless to say we sold $100 coins @ $6 each and we actually had a blast with that $600.  Then of course shortly afterwards we hit the $260 bubble.  I liked to tease my buddies "that was sure a fun $25K trip to Vegas!"  ... when it hit $1000 and it was a $100K trip the joke wasn't so funny anymore!

To keep the blocks ~10 minutes apart no matter how many people are trying is a concept called DIFFICULTY and is the "multiplier" essentially that limits the network production rate.  
Basically if you buy a miner today, sometime in the near future (2 weeks or less) you will be making probably 5-10% less BTC for the same amount of "work" or hashpower, 2 weeks later, another 5-10% less, rinse, repeat forever!

Except the argument as stated is a non-issue.  For a cup of coffee as per the example, zero confirmations would be considered "safe enough" due to the small value of the risked amount.  You don't see owners insisting upon cash and rejecting VISA at coffee shops.  Retailers accept a certain amount of VISA fraud as part of doing business.
Also we can easily prune the blockchain and only keep recent transactions so you aren't keeping everyones cup of coffee forever.

Because 50 goddamn cent transaction fees are a travesty for bitcoin.  Bitcoin was supposed to be improved.  Segwit is a much more complex piece of code compared to simply a hardfork to a new blocksize, but Core couldn't do that.  
Now their lack of follow-up on their own promises equates to a lack of respect for the community's consensus as a whole - its just appalling.  
They held the cards.  They blew it.  People feared Galvin would blow up bitcoin with bigblocks.  Core has ensured it will die on the vine with small blocks and insane fees.  At least until something changes here...

Miners toll the lanes, and want a 10-lane freeway so cars can go fast and they get a higher number of tolls.  
Core Devs say 10 lanes is too big and not everyone has the space for 10 lanes, thus it will lead to centralization.

No it really doesn't bother me.  Miners don't give 2 fucks about you either   ;)
I mined before ASICs.  The definition of Bitcoin created the rules of the game, ASICS just one-upped the stakes.
New ASICs will be created if the POW were to change.  Like Litecoin ASICS (scrypt) were created eventually, but Litecoin was orginally supposed to solve the same POW/ASIC problem.
Technically miners create the blocks and have all the power.  No miners, no bitcoin.  Blocks don't get created from thin air, it takes electricity.  You can argue replacing the current miners with new ones that are different and follow new rules dictated by core is still Bitcoin, and maybe they will convince some.  But those who have been around a long time like myself know better...

You know what?  Those pools all simply did their job:  create blocks/run the network.  BTCGuild even saved the network during the last split by reverting their codebase from 0.8 to 0.7 (2013).
Those pools have done more for bitcoin than anyone in this comment thread.
Central to bitcoin is the concept that longest chain wins.  Vote with the hashes.  That is, by definition, Bitcoin.
May the longest chain win!  Honestly I don't care of that is BU or Core, but you can't just change the fundamental rules of the game when you've clearly defined them previously!   
Lets play a game of basketball, but instead of a backboard/rim/net we make it a football goal!  Still basketball right?  /s

Welcome to why I thought Bitcoin was so awesome back in 2011!  But back then it just seemed like funny money with the ecosystem being soo small, and I used it as a way to obtain more gaming GPUs.   What a cool idea I thought, video cards that pay for themselves in a couple months!
I had a buddy tell me "don't sell any coins now, you'll regret it later" but I just brushed him off.
The potential for exponential growth of the system was just beyond my grasp at that point in time.  Sort of how it was hard to fathom a 5TB hard drive back when 200mb was the norm.
Now I just HODL and mine still a little on the side (though 10TH from a couple Antminer S7s sure beats 50GH from 21 Inc's fancy USB miner!)
But now I won't be surprised when Bitcoin hits $10K/coin, I mean at $5/coin a whopping $1K/coin seemed like an impossibility.  But now that I've seen it happen, if we stay the course, I still believe we are just  at the beginning!

The "main" chain stays 1MB, but now you can have up to 4MB of signatures stored in a separate block(?) (the segregated witness part)  -- at least that's what I'm reading up on now!

The bitcoin network never actually goes down, it just takes a while to find new blocks sometimes.  Except for that one fork in 2013 which they are counting as the only real downtime that lasted a little over 6 hours.
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:38:25
Yep, thats why I learned to stop worrying and love the the fork.
Will have to deal with it sooner or later.  At least with a 2mb blocksize and some threshold of miners required to hit it the forking can happen in a predictable manner.
At this point the argument seems to be SegWit first, then 2mb fork - OR - 2mb fork first, then SegWit.
Either way, we will be dealing with a fork eventually.  Why is laying that groundwork/precedence now such an issue that we are forced to deal with a more complex SegWit adventure first?  Seems to be if you had to pick either/or to go first why delay the fork risk even more?  If you have to deal with that pain, its always easier to deal with it when the network is smaller instead of larger.  Just my 0.02BTC!

Yes I am familiar with ETH and Litecoin and the algorithms involved to mine them.  You think I haven't mind them too?
(for the record, ETH is much more profitable than bitcoin in $/power draw calculations)
But no, those aren't bitcoin.  
In bitcoin,  the “length” of the chain is measured by how much work it took to find each individual block.  So saying "the longest chain wins" is synonymous with "the most proof of work wins."

Luke is smart, and has been around bitcoin a long time.   He's also a pool operator so he really does know his stuff.
But no one is perfect.  I guess no one remembers Luke arguing for a SMALLER blocksize of around a half-megabyte due to "bandwidth issues"?
His logic was essentially people in 3rd world countries would need bitcoin to be essentially dialup compatible, and a smaller blocksize would do that!
Of course the problem is how do you get adoption in the 3rd world @ $1/transaction fee that would result of his proposal?  He does have a bit of "can't see the forest through the trees" syndrome sometimes.
The fact is, its essentially known at this point that something minor like a 2-4-8mb blocksize increase would run just fine.  Yes it would require more bandwidth, and more storage, that's a duh.   Only with Galvin's 20mb blocks did people use quadratic scaling verification issues as the excuse not to accept such a large increase.

Yeah its easy if you control your own DNS servers (ie are an ISP) or your ISP has delegated reverse lookups for the IP address(es) assigned to you to a DNS server you operate.
Reverse DNS lookups aren't like forward lookups, there is no "guarantee" its valid whatsoever.  Quite often Reverse DNS is broken or wrong, or only works inside a providers network with that particular context.

Well SEGWIT is an additional measure designed to "effectively" double whatever the hard limit is set to.
So a 2mb blocksize with segwit is essentially what a 4mb bocksize is today.
But for majorpayne to say "2mb wouldn't harm decentralization" would be contrary to Luke and Theymos' talking points around here....  (remember Luke thinks 1mb is "too big" right now!)

@_date: 2016-03-31 17:34:55
No.  They say 4mb (27tps) with the existing design of the system.  SegWit is "in addition"
The thing that gets me in this study is the roughly $2/transaction "actual cost" of the network as its operating today (and thats a lowball number!). 
If we can get 4MB blocks plus SegWit that drops to like say around $0.25 which starts to seem a lot more reasonable IMNSHO!

Longest chain wins.  If 51% of blocks says BU is Bitcoin, then its Bitcoin by definition.   Right now Core is Bitcoin because mines most the blocks.  Simple really.
The Bitcoin Algorithm defines consensus, and it's created by the miners in blocks.  The fact everyone dances around that fact now is a dangerous precedence if it continues.  Let Bitcoin work as designed.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:35:49
If Bitcoin "Permanently Forks" the winning fork now becomes Bitcoin - almost instantly.  One fork wins, the other loses very rapidly, as no one can afford to be on the "losing" chain.  Miners will be the first to swap to the perceived "winning" chain as they can't handle any downtime at all.  Thus the hashpower will move, rendering the other "losing" fork unable to process blocks essentially.  Say within an hour 80% of the hashpower moves to the perceived "winning" chain, that means blocks on the "losing chain" will be found on average every 50 minutes.  That will piss off the "losing chain" miners and even more will switch, then blocks on the losing chain take an hour and half which pisses off even more "losing chain" miners... see where this is going?
It's really that simple - winner takes all scenario.
People always worry about "losing their funds" or other problems with a fork.  Really none of that is to worry about as long as you don't try to move funds during the brief "who will win the fork" phase.

See I always though of Galvin as more of the visionary with the technical knowledge to "bring it all together" as a complete package.  Then the 20mb proposal hit and people freaked out.  
I know Core has been more cautious, but I just haven't been able to see what their vision is besides "don't change much, we are too afraid it will break"....
It was interesting to hear Amir say "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" and then conclude the way Bitcoin will change for the worse will be incrementally (from within) rather than a sudden outside force.  Crazy how right he was, even before this whole size debate was on the radar!

There doomday senarios for "average" miners.  With AntMiner S7s (i.e. 7 months old ASIC) and $400/coin basically after the halving even "cheap" power like $0.08/KWH power was unprofitable.  Now that its $700/coin the mines can keep running!
But it doesn't matter, difficulty will rise as the S9 is out and does 14TH instead of 5TH for the same amount of power.  Go fig!

Mining is a snapshot in time.  Related to cost of gear, cost of power, difficulty, and bitcoin price.
Because cost of power is in this equation, there is of course a minimum cost to operate even if gear has already ROI'd (i.e paid for its initial cost).
One of 3, or some combination of all 3 things can happen:
1)  50% of miners drop out
2)  Price increase 2x
3)  Twice as efficient chips show up (requires new ROI calculations)
Because these variables and their projections are different for every miner, their actions will be different.  About a month ago I did the math and at $450/coin with a "paid for" S7 and $0.10/KWH power I figured after the "halving" it would cost me $600 to generate 1 bitcoin.  So basically unprofitable.  Now that coins have increased to near $600 that means I might break even, but difficulty is still going up up up so I'm back into guaranteed negative!  So I need either miners to drop out after it goes to half OR a continued price increase.  Will see!

Actually, I know you were going for "/s" but that actually has a lot of truth to it.
All SSL is not created equally.  Just look at all the SSL vulnerabilities out in the past year.  You can be really bad/lazy with SSL.  If this was a fly-by-night operation they would probably be running a poor SSL configuration, using wildcards (not inherently bad, but if the cert leaks the bad guys can pretend to anything on the site), etc.
Just check out SSL Labs report for 
They use certificate pinning (awesome - no Lenovo MITM crap!) with HSTS (means browsers have to respect HTTPS-only for the entire domain) and get the coveted A+ rating.
SSL certs are a pain, and even more of pain to "do it right".  These guys from all indications I can see are "doing it right" so that takes time.  It's possible this particular cert that expired has triggered some backend difficulties for them since it's not the regular web browser interactions we are dealing with here.

Shit that sucks man.  Look at the bright side, my Avalon batch 3 cost me 100btc but only mined 50.
The real cost of the s9 batch2 is 3.4btc but if you pay anything for power it won't ROI.   If I had not purchased my batch 2/4 s7 and instead saved those coins then take the $150/month on power I've spent for the past 9months and bought bitcoin instead I'd have more BTC overall.
Overall mining is a losing game because it's just a race to the bottom.

+1 to that.
As a miner since 2011 people don't realize there are good reasons.  Mostly it's chinese miners today and they choose chinese pools.
And non-miners don't even think about things like PPS or PPLNS.  There is a reason f2pool is popular, ie  because it's PPS (like the original deepbit) where the pool takes all the risk and you can count on the payout being steady for X hashrate.  I always did PPS until I "ROI"'d a piece of gear historically.
Find me a good PPS pool that isn't chinese, oh wait, there isn't one!

Yesterday was the first time I have ever seen Circle fail to confirm a transfer of mine right away.  Eventually it did confirm about an hour later.  It made me re-lookup the current fee prices and change my client to be 2x the previous fee, and so I was able to subsequently send right away --- overall not too bad all things considered.
I do think we should have 2 or 4mb blocks by now, but I guess this beta test of the fee market is actually coming along, just slowly.
Actually I would be more happy with a 5 or 2 minute block time rather than 10 minutes, and then I'm fine with leaving the 1mb cap for now, but I'm sure many would say that departs too much from the original bitcoin!

You should read the whitepaper again.  Bitcoin is brilliant.   But to suggest a PoW *change* would clearly *not* be Bitcoin.  We have an altcoin just about identical to Bitcoin with different PoW and it's called LiteCoin.  Notice how it has ASICs also?  
Miners RUN the network.  They are an integral part.  They also hold a lot of BTC.  Luke was a miner back in the day even, and ran his own pool.  Miners built the network, they have something to lose if it goes away, many miners are big holders, without their involvement there would be no Bitcoin as it is today.  Why did they commit to building the network?  Because it was resistant to whimsical change!  If you have REAL money invested, you won't be doing stupid shit.
You seem to think of miners as inconvenience.  And while I agree the Chinese attitude is quite different than ours, the game was setup a certain way and we all play by the rules.  *Changing* the rules in the middle of the game, well that's a *different* game!
People buy Bitcoin which is clearly setup as a miner-centric/reliant technology by pure virtue of system, then complain about the miners.  WTF?  Why not just buy you own equipment and outhash the Chinese then - or go make your own coin!
Luke's threat to change PoW is like admission that he has lost the game so he wishes to change the rules to his benefit.  My statement is simply Core has WON the battle by having 95% of the hashrate, and yet still talks about a PoW change - probably the most insane reaction to disliking 5% of the network??
I think of Miners as being more akin to the fiber/routers/switches that run Internet, and Luke as more of the janitor.
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:32:38
Yep, its always been a race to the bottom.  A bet against the difficulty multiplier.  Ultimately a bet vs all other miners.
I used to think my "low" residential power rate of $0.07/KWH would always guarantee me a thin margin.  I mean I was mining with GPUs and doubling my money!  (mining a coin for $3 selling for $6)
Then this whole ASIC thing came about, and my buddy who had been mining forever said "do you really think they will sell magic money making machines for less than they can earn with them?"  I should have listened.
And then the floodgates of ASICs released, each outpacing the last making each investment a risky bet against mining inflation (aka difficulty).  I trusted Avalon on their original ASICs they would continue to release batches at a steady pace.  Instead they flooded the market with shady backend deals (took the chips I already paid for and gave them to someone else - quickly the new "norm" in mining) and made difficulty skyrocket at a pace never before seen.
**Bitmain perfected the tactic, selling original Antminer S7s at nearly 8 BTC each, now sells for 0.67 BTC.**
TL;DR:  MINING IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM

Yawn.... if you actually read the post I was replying to the context would make more sense.  He was ragging on miners.   But since you like the whitepaper: *"To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity"*
About the only thing it DOESN'T talk about is SHA-256 directly, but the idea is to make it *change resistant.*  Right now Bitcoin has the most powerful hashing computing network on the planet, extremely change resistant, and you want to just toss it and all of a sudden make it very vulnerable to whimsical change for political reasons?  LMAO, sorry that's not Bitcoin!

ETH mining profitability has dropped from ~800% cost of power to 280% cost of power for me, where bitcoin is hovering around 75%.  Give it a few more weeks and ETH will keep trending down on profitability.  That difficulty modifier is a real bitch sometimes!
But one is SHA256 algorithm and the other is DaggerHashimoto algorithm, so yeah apples to oranges!
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:26:03
At first glance maybe.
But its simply just reporting live status of nodes running all the different various potential versions (Core, BTC1, USAF, ABC-BCC, BIP91) and what current block they are on, along with the pointer to the previous block.
If all of a sudden we see a split, there will be different block heights and different hashes.
Right now everything matches so we are just fine!

Miners did in the NYA.  I admit, as a miner myself Luke into Bitcoin nearly as long as you have, we both know the checks and balances of Bitcoin ecosystem relies on miners to work WITH the rest of the community for things to be successful.
A community with no miners means no security, and no transaction processing.  Miners with no community means no coin value.  Its a ying &amp; yang symbiotic relationship.
The fact that it appears &gt;95% of miners stayed on BTC clearly signals their intention to stay with Core's chain for now.  But I do hope a rational discussion of BTC's scaling in the future can occur.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:35:12
Yeah bitcoin changes difficulty every 2 weeks on average assuming 10 minute blocks (every 2016 blocks the difficulty changes). 
Besides this special difficulty decrease that was hit to give us the initial drop, difficulty will be recalculated after 2016 blocks  and since blocks are roughly 20 minutes right now instead of 10 I would expect 4 weeks before the next adjustment.

MongoDB is awesome for quick prototyping and "getting it up and running".
With that said, NEVER use MongoDB for things where you need large transaction volume and data consistency.

This whole dev spat is a mess, I agree.
But due to the mining concerns I laid out in my post above this I don't see the "losing" chain being around long.  The fork will mean you HAVE to be on the &gt;75% chain or you don't get paid - miners will not hold out for 2-3 months while getting paid 20% of their previous profits just "hoping it works out".

This is one of the better soft/hard fork explanations I have read.
To get &gt;1MB requires a hard fork of the blockchain.  Period.  And its not like soft forks are much better.
The July 4th BIP66 soft fork caused plenty of little problems but was pretty mundane in the end.  The 2013 hard fork that split the network between versions 0.7 &amp; 0.8 was a bit scarier but also ended up just fine because pool operators stepped in.
So despite our best intentions, forks happen.  But they don't scare me because I know they will be fixed as those who run the network have a pretty good financial incentive to keep it going!

BitFury, 21, and KnC are the biggest "closed" pools.
Otherwise "joe miner" can choose to swap between most any of the other pool options on a moments notice.
BTCGuild (RIP, our hero from the last hard fork) was once nearly half the network, and now does not exist (thanks NY!).  GHash.io had the same position subsequently and now is just 2% of the network.
Pools come and go. The fact no-one pool is &gt;20% of the network means Bitcoin is more diversified in hashing power than ever before.  The only downside is most all big pools are Chinese now, but then again that is where a majority of the ASICs are made and China is a big reason Bitcoin got as big as it is today.
@_date: 2015-08-28 00:32:04
"Invalid and reset" is a bit extreme.  The network forked, I forget exactly but it was around a 55/45 split, but the 55% on 0.8 would never accept the 45% 0.7 block so BTCGuild (the largest pool with over a third of the network at the the time) reverted to the older 0.7 version which was accepted by all clients and tipped the balance to make the more compatible chain win out, thus disaster was averted.

In November of 2013 I had a stuck 2BTC MtGox withdrawl.  Support eventually fixed it but it was a huge red flag (for me).
Things finally came crashing down 3 months later as more and more % of transactions would get "stuck" until BTC transfers were simply halted (and that's how I lost 13BTC to gox! *sigh*)
Mark blamed this on transaction malleability (of course!) but do you have any other ideas/insight on why the system would randomly refuse to pay out BTC?  Seemed like a bug in the code he could execute at will or something...

As a miner since 2011 this is where your logic fails.
Miner's aren't going to give a crap about the "losing" chain.  One chain wins and the other loses.  
Lets see how this could all play out:
In the scenario where BIP 101 goes "live" that means &gt;75% of the hashing power has voted.  There may be a few tiny pools and perhaps 1 "big" pool that hasn't yet gone 101.  Within minutes of the first &gt;1MB block the losing chain will all of a sudden be running on a tiny fraction of the previous hashpower and blocks will on average take over an hour to find on the inferior chain!  Difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks and could all of a sudden be two to three months away on the "old" chain!

@_date: 2015-08-12 07:02:54
Why does he think it *"does not matter soo much"?*  Because even if the hard limit was 8MB, or 20MB individual pools could still set their limit lower.  If a block was generated &gt;1MB that caused a fork in the network the damage probably would be equal to, uhh last time a big fork like this happened?  
TL;DR:  Pools would revert to a 1MB limit until the kinks get worked out.

Oh yes its a 2-way street.  But when luke-jr says "investors run bitcoin not miners" in another thread the reality is ...*gasp* it takes everyone!
However, the raw blocks are found by miners, and investors have to provide incentive (ie a better ROI) for miners to switch to something else.  Generally miners will mine whatever they find is most profitable.

Its an unregulated market.  The price is set by whales and those in the shadows instead of any of us.  I've seen my fair share of brigading and censorship on both sides.

51% made sense as a threat when the network was small.  Not soo much anymore.
Now there is so much silicon on the network, it would require a new breakthrough in technology that was significantly more efficient to obsolete the current network or even begin to compete with it.
If anything, a 51% attack is the least of our worries and there are much cheaper ways to effectively attack the network.

44% is just the pools stating 8mb support in the coinbase sig/Op Return
f2pool has also stated support for 8mb blocks but does not state that in the sig yet - that is 17% more of the network
slush is only 3-4%
So total that is ~65% of the network.  
However the issue is there is not ONE agreed-upon method to increase the size to 8MB.

0.11BTC on BBuilder is only if you already transferred your coins to their MTGOX account BEFORE Gox shut down.
The reality is all BTC holders are just one more creditor in-line, and the 200K BTC will be sold off to fund ALL creditors in JPY.

They may "skip" the actual selling-off BTC, but they still convert everything to JPY to calculate who-gets-what.
When it comes to fiat:  So $11M in assets with $64M in liabilities (as per wikipedia).
They already stated BTC holders will be "pegged" @ ~$400USD for liability calculation reasons:  So 850K BTC (*$400) = $340M, plus $64M = $404M total owed to creditors.
Actual on hand:  200K BTC (*300) = $60M + 11M fiat = $71M
So it appears by these rough estimated calculations they may have 17% of the funds, but you can be sure the lawyers can skew those numbers!

900mhz ISM Unlicensed is a trash band as it is only 26mhz wide (compare that to 480mhz total on 5Ghz!)   It is a low frequency that propagates like crazy with 1W and thus the noise floor is through the roof.
You can't change the wireless laws of physics and even with crazy MIMO you won't go the distances claimed without a massive violation of EIRP (ie max wattage) rules so its either less range than claimed, or some other important detail was left out.  As pointed out 900mhz bandwidth is scare so if this thing mucked up the spectrum due to say bad behavior the FCC could have stepped in.

Miners have given up on verifying blocks because the slightly longer-time it takes to verify them means they might lose out on the reward race.  It doesn't matter what max size the blocks are some pools will and do create occasional zero transaction blocks just because its faster.

Core just basically put their hands over their ears and and screamed "I'm not listening to you!" when it came to entertaining a blocksize increase.
For them the logic was "we will never be able to prove 100% bitcoin works at anything besides 1mb, so thus a hardfork is not an option."
Heck LukeJr saying we should DECREASE the blocksize (as its obviously too large already, think of the ISDN users!). 
And while I realize the risks are huge, and they are trying to be responsible the fact is nothing would ever get done if the FUD groupies and naysayers hold back progress.
Nothing will ever be 100% certain/safe, and everything has risks, the key is managing the risk appropriately.   Core was just using claimed risks to justify "1mb forever", which now thanks to pressure from XT and Classic is apparently now "Segwit &amp; 2mb Forever" (but you might acually see that change 1.5yrs from now).

".... second time his half-assed solution became an integral part of Bitcoin's consensus code."
On the contrary, going SegWit and doing circus tricks to keep 1mb cap that satoshi intended as temporary is the half-assed solution here!  2mb from 1mb is really a KISS solution, and in this case sets the consensus precedence for forking which is something we *will* have to deal with sooner or later.

When new higher efficiency gear comes out the difficulty always goes up for a while.  But there was nearly a whole year of low % increases between the Antminer S5 and S7.  Many of the adjustments were in the 2-4% range or actually negative!
Bitmain knew miners had been lulled into thinking this was the new norm, released the S7, and demanded quite a premium over previous ASIC launches (basically requiring buyers to "bet" that difficulty would only rise 5-6% average for ~8 months to even have a chance of ROI).
So what does Bitmain do?  They don't give a shit and decided to fuck the early S7 adopters by slashing the price and ramping up production even more!  Price the miners too high to start and then produce even more to guarantee a loss, thanks Bitmain!

Paywall, so here's the text:
PayPal Holdings Inc. this week blocked a parody of its “New Money” Super Bowl ad that swapped in “bitcoin” as the future of money.
PayPal, which lets users and businesses pay digitally in a variety of ways, was one of a few financial upstarts to spend big money on a spot during last Sunday’s Super Bowl 50 football game.
The commercial that was published online earlier this month and ran during the game touts PayPal as “New Money” against “Old Money” like paper cash and banks that close at 5 p.m.
But the message apparently riled some backers of bitcoin, who consider the digital currency “the new money.”
Shiloh Silverman, who runs a video production firm called Silver Park Studio, created a version of the ad that swapped in images of people using bitcoin and substituted “PayPal” to proclaim “Bitcoin is newer money.”
PayPal redefines the meaning of new money, in this Super Bowl ad.
After Mr. Silverman posted the video to YouTube and others shared it, PayPal responded by asking websites to remove the video. As of Monday, the parody ad had been blocked.
“Our vision of New Money includes Bitcoin,” a PayPal spokeswoman said in an email on Wednesday. “But to avoid customer confusion, we asked them for the video to be removed.”
PayPal primarily helps people transfer money in traditional currencies, but it also works with bitcoin. It has partnered with companies such as digital wallet provider CoinBase to accept bitcoin payment via PayPal’s Braintree platform. Braintree powers online payments for companies such as Uber Technologies Inc.
“Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” the PayPal spokeswoman said in the email. "I think this demonstrates just how excited customers are about the concept behind PayPal’s ’New Money’ campaign.”
A new version of the video posted by Mr. Silverman this week that hasn’t been taken down also changed the ad’s music. “Newer money is decentralized. Older money is fiat,” the new parody says.
“I’m not a bitcoin fanatic, I just love the whole world of it,” Mr. Silverman said in an interview.

I think the downvotes support this doesn't "highlight his level of ...awareness about bitcoin"

Yep.  Now where is the part where a $160 6TB hard drive can hold all of the blockchain with 10MB blocks for the next 10 years of the Bitcoin Blockchain?
Or the fact the SegWit data probably still would be downloaded anyway for most clients, so its really a wash for "total data transferred"?
Just sayin the above is still true, downvote me all you want.  Yes we know verification of large blocks is an issue.  Yes bandwidth is an issue, but 4mbps handles 1MB blocks today just fine, so 40mbps would be enough to handle 10MB blocks just fine.  
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:21:04
So pretty much "we want fee pressure now".  As one of the quotes said, you can't give something to people free for 10 years then start charging.
Likewise, I would say you can't avoid the fork forever - it's like they think kicking the hardfork can down the road for years really helps?
I dunno.  I like SW I guess for the malleability fixes but in a lot of ways it seems like a more complicated solution then dealing with the hardfork issue now and getting some experience with the whole process.

Yeah because we all know mining in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ($0.15-$0.25/KWH plus high usage penalty/prime time adders) costs the same as mining in WASHINGTON STATE ($0.03-$0.12/KWH flat usage rate)!
Fun fact:  Washington State gets nearly all its power from Dams, Windmills, Solar, and Nuclear.  But the state doesn't consider Dams as "renewable" (think of the fish!) so we keep building more solar/windmills subsidized by taxpayers to meet "renewable" goals.

Emergency difficulty adjustment.  It let "cash" survive with a fraction of the mining horsepower otherwise it would have ground to a halt and no one would have mined it.
Miners Chase whatever is most profitable, and they found they could rig the EDA to drop BCH difficulty temporarily then swap back to it and voilla ... profits!

I mean Bitcoin only created the space.  Has the largest network with the most transactions and power by far.
Have you seen how little Zcash is actually USED?  How ETH had crypto kitties melt down their network?
The point of Bitcoin was to have one crypto that needed to be the bulletproof example for decentralized trust or this whole space would be DOA.
The value in Bitcoin is its immutability that no other crypto can come close to matching right now when you actually start looking at it compared to the other networks.  The features other coins are experimenting with now can simply be added to Bitcoin once those ideas are proven (or end up failing) on those "test" coins.
Don't believe me?  Just note the differences in these two lists:

Funny how they mention *"While a trader can deal with volatility, a miner has a line in the sand."*
That actually IMNSHO is what makes the new price "floor".  At some price point people investing in mining decide to just buy coins instead, and that actually helps maintain the minimum "floor" price of BTC.

Well you both make good points.  But BCH is the only other SHA-256 coin that people move major hashpower to/from so now that EDA is gone from BCH the hashpower swings *should* die down also.
Before BCH's EDA we didn't see these large hashpower swings like that, and we likely won't see them afterwards unless some kind of attack knocks major mining countries off the grid.  We do see spikes in new hashpower hit the network when Bitmain releases new chip batches, but nothing like when BCH EDA fuckery was around!
However I agree the fee crisis is definitely not over, because if Bitcoin goes &gt;$20K the mania will be back, and in greater numbers!

As a miner since 2011 it's hard to convey exactly how crazy mining hardware efficiencies have played out.  My Avalon ASIC original with 110nm chips was 100 times less efficient than the current gen 16nm chips (10W/GH vs 0.1W/GH) and things are still getting smaller!

@_date: 2015-04-23 23:15:10
To be fair, this is just software, with a "hardfork" you could technically make it oh, say^42 million BTC too.
Yes I know 21 million BTC is the hard cap based on the math as it is today, but as long as the miners "vote in" a new version (ie adopt its rules) and it gains &gt;50% use whatever that code says really becomes the new law-of-bitcoin.
But all developers and miners have agrees 21 million is it.  So that is probably the thing least likely to actually change about bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:59:36
Just not worth it.  Original SHA-256 ASICs to current-gen is 100-fold difference in efficiency (10W per GH to 0.1W per GH).   I believe S2 is basically around 1W or 2W/GH, and so it costs you 10-20x more to run than current day gear.  I run a 0.25W/Gh S7 with cheap ($0.07/KW) power and it's not really profitable either, more like "break even"!  
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:05:04
Oh don't get me wrong I love Nicehash, but mining alts on their pools doesn't directly support "No2X hashpower".  You'd need an SHA-256 ASIC pointed to an appropriate pool, that's all I was trying to point out!
For the record I've mined at Slush and F2 for the past couple years with my S7 rigs.  Funny how F2 originally was a hated pool due to their size and being Chinese, but non-miners don't realize the benefit of straight PPS when you are trying to guarantee ROI on a new ASIC - I spent almost 10BTC to buy only two S7s back when they first released!  Antminer has the numbers figured out, you'll make approximately the same as you invest.

@_date: 2017-10-03 23:49:21


Exactly the issue.  S2 is 1 Terrahash, but draws a little over 1KW.
If you pay $0.10/KWH it costs you $2.40 a day to run the miner.  And you'll make ~$1 per day in Bitcoin.  But you get a 1KW heater.  
So you spend $72 per month to make $30 in Bitcoin you just have to hope its providing ~$42 worth of heating off your gas bill to break even!  These numbers of course change based on your power rate, and the difficulty of the network in the future (generally goes up of course).

@_date: 2018-02-27 23:21:03


Everyone who had BTC before the fork could claim that!
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:26:44
But theoretically say if 80% of the hashrate went 2X imagine the bidding war to get in the once-every-hour single block.  BCH only survived because of the emergency difficulty adjustments that were triggered - it would have died completely without that.
Since 2X is leaving the difficulty adjustment alone, this really is a "winner takes all" scenario.
Both Satoshi and Gavin agree the longer chain (difficulty included) by definition is Bitcoin.  It didn't happen with BCH, but it could happen with 2x!

Technically we can still go to $0 on this one...
But not really, I think both scenarios are equally unlikely.  Why?  Miners have millions upon millions invested.  It still costs real power/cooling/gear investments etc to run the network.  Miners have a vested interest in keeping a minimum price floor, as going below that means they have to turn off equipment.
Not an exact science, but I believe that is the pressure keeping us &gt;$200.

DZaneMorris -
So you come back and see the "crazies" are still at work on this.  Great!
But back when you were covering Bitcoin it was the new investment kid on the block.  Everyone was basically comparing it to a stock.
Now that it's no longer the "shiny new thing" and that bubble like all the others before it burst do you see this perception changing?
Right now the hot talking points buzz seems to be the whole "bitcoin may not be the future but blockchain technology is".   Which is pretty funny for those of us who have been around forever and know the only reason the blockchain works is because of the Bitcoin reward miners collect.  Running the largest super-computing network in the world isn't free you know!

Just like this OPoW idea.  The same amount of power will just be sunk into this "new" gear, and provide whatever company the same advantage Bitmain enjoys now.

I felt bad for him and paid 25BTC for the extra module so he wouldn't be out quite soo much.  But of course that just made my B3 investment 100BTC instead  :(
I put a portable A/C unit right into the front of that box, and had it running &gt;100GH with those 4 modules it was crazy impressive coming from GPUs before! 
The sad part was those Batch 3s only lost money because Avalon was selling chips out the back door and fabricated delays.  I got my Batch 3 2.5months late, and if I had gotten it anywhere near the planned release it would have been a 200% gain instead of a 50% loss.   can be depressing  :(

I like that we all trust them to keep it a 1 to 1 ratio on hashpower sold via bidding vs actual.  My comment was just pointing out we really don't know for sure, and plenty of "cloud miners" in the past  were just people paying out based on math, with no real hashes behind it.   Their situation is a little different as they have to actually have the hashes to point them somewhere, but as they don't have direct control over users mining with them and hashpower can join/leave as desired I'm sure they have a certain amount of "slush fund buffer" built into the system!

That works as long as both chains have enough hashing power.   Remember hashes still run the network!  If miners and "payment gateways" as you put them were to disagree, and the payment gateways chooses the weaker chain, you can bet attacks will occur against the weaker chain (block withholding, etc) and I wouldn't bet it survives long-term.
Reminds me of the 0.6/0.7 fork.  Only thing that saved the network then was the fact the big mining pools were able to vote with their hashes and revert the change.  While payment processors halted their own internal transactions, they had no power beyond that.

The thing is the cards are fine at say 76 or 80c for gaming for periods of time.  Because it ends.  Not 24/7/365! 
Nvidia cards are nice for mining on a gaming rig right now because the "power limit" modifier basically allows you to slightly downvolt to save energy.  All GPUs used for mining should run slightly less than stock voltage to extend lifetime, assuming you actually want to keep the card long-term!  It takes a lot of watts to gain that extra 5% output!
I know on my 1080Ti I can set it to 90% power level and the heat output/power draw decreases by a lot, and I only lose a few hashes.  YMMV!

Fuck man as a miner this was a PITA because I had accidentally swapped most *all* my configs over to 3301 (slush XT port) instead of 3333 (default) globally so lost quite a few hashes the past 24 hours since I was trying to talk to my backup pool on the wrong port!  DOH ...

Well the cost of the unit was 4BTC when BTC was $1K.  According to my calcs it approx mined ~5.5BTC but power cost for the 1.2 years it ran was around $20/month (or $280ish).
So $4,280 invested for a $1,210 return if I "cashed out" today. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:18:18
$100 would be interesting.  Mostly because MINERS are already really hurting near $200, and NO ONE would make any money @ $100 unless half the miners drop out and difficulty decreases.  Sub $200 and its a bloodbath, especially if it drops that low say overnight!
When it costs MORE in POWER COST to run the network than just buying BTC directly, miners are forced to turn off their equipment.  When miners turn off their equipment, confirmations take longer, when confirmations take longer the network grinds to a halt.  When the network grinds to halt, you better a hope a difficulty adjustment isn't too far away!
Don't be Sub-200 guy.  Switch to Bull Market, and forget cable.

There is a reason miners are in big fan-cooled warehouses in China and garages in the US...  When the useful life of a powersupply outlasts an ASICS useful lifespan you begin to realize its all just throw-away hardware in the end.

Wow Star.  Your point  shows exactly why you played along with XT censorship.  You know this forum drives a large percentage of the perception of Bitcoin and XT had to be blackballed to kill it in your mind.
As for  XT *WAS* BEING CENSORED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  There was NOT A SINGLE XT THREAD ALLOWED!  It was *only* because of the MASS OUTCRY from users that the censorship was toned down.
WTF is this option   "people would be well aware of the censorship, but every side would be on more equal ground to discuss their ideas" -- NO the mods simply banned/deleted those who disagreed.  Mods chose the winning side.
Now let me explain this from the perspective of a  long-term miner since 2011 who has always been on board with the original Satoshi vision:
Core was fine when Galvin was around as lead.  In my mind he has a proven track record.  (on the flip side I couldn't give a rats  about Hearn)
Since Core went "stale" (analysis-paralysis) and appeared to resist ANY changes, including holding onto asinine concepts such as "1MB ought to be enough for anyone" SOMETHING had to be done.
Galvin's approach may not have been correct, but it definitely got results.  Small-blockers like luke-jr seem to want to keep Bitcoin dialup compatible and force the fee market.  The problem is that approach kills any option for exponential growth which will occur when the price starts to rise again. That is not the bitcoin I was promised.  I was promised global transfers with low fees.
In my opinion XT did its "job" of shaking up the status quo.  We will get bigger blocks it seems.  This forum should remain a place that allows discussions like we are having right now.  
@_date: 2015-09-09 08:29:39
1.6 trillion yen and only 1.2 left after fees/expenses of the "liquidation" alone, not considering general bankruptcy debts.  So $10 Million USD, but more than 6x that in liabilities overall  :(

And Nuclear energy was supposed save us and be "too cheap to meter!" back in the day too... and we know how that worked out!
But realistically, the banking system sucks down a ton of electrical power today supporting their physical locations and digital processes. The beauty of bitcoin is (if we get bigger blocks) theoretically you could support millions (billions someday...) of users on the same amount of power draw as if just your buddies used it.
Just because you did the math and think "for the current TPS rate we pay way too much" doesn't mean it gets exponentially cheaper as the adoption rate goes up and additional TPS is realized for little or no additional power requirements.

Yeah BitcoinTalk always had a horrid *Signal to Noise ratio* but it was a smaller community and people stayed in the forum that interested them mainly (ie software dev, hardware dev, mining, selling, etc) so eventually you knew who-thought-what and the public stayed away so you could filter out the noise rather easily.

I don't see how this chip is really any different than say the Antminer BM1382 in the U3 miner from an "embedded" standpoint:    - just use that with a Rasbpi and BAM you have same functionality as 21 inc is advertising for 1/5th the price.
You likewise could embed that Antminer chip in a regular consumer device just like 21 inc does with their chip.  There is NOTHING special about 21's chip.  Heck Cisco could just as well use the new Antminer BM1385 chip and enjoy twice the power efficiency of 21's chip.
The **REAL** story here is the fact that 21 inc made their own ASIC, has been mass producing it to the point they alone are 4% of the network, and now this is a creative way to "sell" that chip to the masses.  However this hype'd-up all-in-one thus-far-vaporware product is certainly their "Plan B". 
When they first designed this chip no doubt it was thought they had the best efficiency and would make "bank" with it.  Then they hoarded the chips for themselves, Bitcoin prices slid and Antminer's consistent reliable releases outperformed them, to the point **21's chip is essentially obsolete**.
So their solution is to sell you their chip with a Rasbpi included and some nifty (but yet to be released) software and charge 5X for it!
21inc is just realizing what Cointerra, BFL, and Hashfast all learned the hard way:  You can't compete with the Chinese designs and stay relevant because their development cycle is already as compressed and efficient as possible, as a bonus they can sell cheap when needed!

Has nothing to do with mining centralization either.  Just nodes transmitting blocks and verifying them.

Yeah that makes them "most efficient" but you don't buy a card to only produce half the hashes with 1/4th the power - you buy them to hash and hopefully get somewhat decent efficiency!
On my 1080Ti using EWBF I get 575 Sol using 80% power limit, but 675 Sol using 90% power limit.  100% power limit only gets a few Sol more.   I forget what the wattage difference was when I checked with my KillaWatt meter, but I quickly did the math and figured out 90% was the best output to draw ratio in my environment for what I want!

First deliveries were not until June/July 2014 when the BTC price had crashed down to half, and sustained high difficulty increases eroded the value.
The cost for a 5 module Neptune set has been below $2K for quite some time, and realistically is around $500 on eBay today.

A lot?  Probably not.  If you include initial cost of the gear, definitely not.
Take an Antminer S5 for example, at $0.05/KWH  (cheapest US power, average Chinese power cost) it takes only $0.75/day to run, but generates $3 in BTC.
So you make $2.25 profit per day.  But at $340 cost, it takes you almost half a year to break even - and that assuming zero difficulty increase!  (break even == ROI as miners call it, many miners never make it!)
So if you had free brand new equipment, $100 would cover the power cost to generate a coin, but you still wouldn't make any "profit" for months...
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:16:11
S9 is the most efficient.  S7 was 16nm, and takes about 1200W to make 4.5TH.  S9 does 13TH for the same wattage. 
Everyone is into bitcoin mining these days, the margins are razor thin because of the huge farms in China paying anywhere from a half cent to $0.03/KWH, and they use raw outdoor air for cooling.

Edit:  Downvotes really?  Not saying its GOING to happen, but it is a worst-case scenario that is a realistic threat!
If the conditions are right, it could cause a snowball effect:
"Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty adjusts based on how much capacity seems to be mining. Under normal operations, 2016 blocks is two weeks, as long as people are mining at the rate seen in the 2 weeks prior to setting the current difficulty. If large volumes of miners shut off their rigs as non-productive, the mining rate would crash. The wait for a new difficulty could be not just two weeks if this happened at the wrong time, but 4 weeks if half the miners shut down, or 8 weeks if 3/4 of them left. In terms of the Bitcoin world, it’s effectively forever, and long before that, confidence in the coin price would probably drop further, causing more miners to shut off their rigs. Only dedicated fans willing to lose money to preserve the system would keep mining."
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:07:20
Did you already ROI all those cards?  Generally once you've got to break even and you start to worry about power costs it makes sense to back off on the clocks.   Temps are what kill cards.  My card games and mines, and stays 64C with the squirrel cage reference fan @ 70% while mining with 90% power limit.  Not worried about killing a card with those settings, I could resell it just fine.
But yes overall power capacity is a big concern.  I added 5x20A to my garage and ran them all at half load, even 80% loading scares me for fire risk.   I mine with AMD in the garage with dedicated rigs, and a couple SHA-256 ASICs.  Nvidia is just the combo game rigs in the house.
Good luck with your S Corp.  Hopefully you started early with those 32 cards, not sure building a "new setup" is going to ROI these days very easily!
For reference, I mined with 14 GPUs back in the day then moved to ASICs which is where the mistakes were made.  I'd like to think of my experience more of a hobby that went out of control  :)

Think about this from a pool operators perspective:  3301 has issues, so announce it's being "closed", but on the flip side don't reject any hashes that do happen make it through!  For miners that can't hit 3301 hopefully a valid backup was set.

Honestly this whole question is kind of dumb because there are MORE assets out there than just bitcoin, and like any other currency you can exchange between them seamlessly.  So you pay back "interest" with another asset or crypto that you then convert to Bitcoin.
Remember for Bitcoin to have a value there always has to be someone willing to sell!  Otherwise the price will just go up forever... (hint hint)
I can tell you borrowing  against an ultimately deflationary crypto is a bad idea.  I myself told a buddy I would pay him ONE bitcoin for a concert ticket... $7,700 ticket today yeah he called that play right!  (he's a HODL'r!)

Uhh take it from a miner that's been tracking these details since the GPU days, 21inc device hashrate is too low @ 50GH (vs 5000GH for each Bitmain Antminer S7) to cause this quick spike.  KNC hasn't released any recent news and Spondoolies is MIA with their "next gen" ASIC.
The reality is the hashrate was growing @ ~2% without anyone actively releasing new gear, and now that Bitmain has doubled efficiency yet again they are finally moving S7 miners in quantity. 
What happened is with that runup in BTC price, the ROI on the S7 became much more lucrative for a small time there (hit as low as 3.5BTC for ~5TH instead of 5BTC) so we are just seeing those results!

The Meat:
    "Bitcoin Core is pursuing a different approach, where the memory pool is ordered by fee and then if a higher fee transaction comes in, it jumps the queue and whoever is at the end falls off. This makes sense given their small-blocks view of the world. They want the Bitcoin network to be permanently full because they want to establish a fee market where Bitcoin users compete against each other for the, um, privilege of making payments with Bitcoin. 
 ...
    It’s hard to see how this can really work for the following reason: everyone is incentivised to pay the lowest fee possible for their required confirmation time (normally, one block). If you don’t really care about confirmation time the most cost-efficient place to be is right at the bottom of the queue but not actually falling off. This is a very tricky place to be. 
     all you can see is whether your transaction appeared in the block chain or not. If you got completely evicted from the mempool, well, you have no way to know that. You’d just have to wait a really long time and eventually try again with a higher fee. Which, you know, the Bitcoin protocol also doesn’t currently support.
    So setting up this kind of fluid fee market not only requires massive and complicated changes to Bitcoin Core, but also all the wallets, and the protocol too. That’s why it’s not easily deployed. Worse, if wallets pick some default fee level (very likely) then everyone just fights over that point in the queue and the outcome is essentially random

MtGox was always slow with fiat, but it was BTC delays that really started the "red flag" events.  In November of 2013 I had a "stuck" BTC withdrawl transaction on MtGox - an early warning sign of things to come.
The simple fact was there weren't any good alternatives and everyone accepted the fact that Gox was buggy ... but in those days the other options were just as shady if not more so!  For my November struck transaction support was finally able to "fix" it.  I tried to swear off Gox but I had a couple "locked" payout addresses to them so I figured oh well no other real options at that point ... and the next time I moved around coins was Feb 2014 and of course I had planned that Gox was only supposed to be an intermediary-step for an hour.
Fucking Karpeles.  Stole the coins the minute they hit the deposit address.  Support was AWOL, and I called it that week - Gox is going down.  The forums were buzzing with issues.  But yet people still sent coins to them for nearly another month!

theymos is the owner of bitcointalk.org and has for many years ran that (fundamental to bitcoin) forum .  As a miner since those early days I can tell you the community pretty much made that place the center of bitcoin.  Anyway, long story short he took donations to run the site back when Bitcoin was worth single digits and less, and when it blew up in price... well:

I thought the "bad code" we had before where it would take peers forever to download the blockchain and data was constantly being resent/duplicated was much worse than this from a bandwidth perspective!
Riddle me this -  Galvin's XT only starts randomly dropping NEW transactions BELOW a certain fee threshold once the mempool gets to 25x the normal blocksize maximum.  Seems like that's similar to "minrelaytxfee" but since its dynamic it ends up being a better solution.
As for the relay network, its cool and all but has other issues.  As per Matt:
"So currently the relay network *really* cant handle the spam attacks, because of things that need changed..." and it appears he's already running into bandwidth cost issues so seems to me like the block relay network is still rather "beta".

Bitcoin has a perception problem with a portion of the population as being associated with nefarious activity/scams/etc.  Now before any of you downvote this, hear me out!
I have posted crazy good deals on "deal forums" before that required Bitcoin to get the savings and been downvoted to heck just for mentioning the word, and as a result had to call people out on this exact behavior.
Until that perception changes issues like this will continue.  It will take time, but the consumer case to use Bitcoin is still pretty weak at this point with the ingrained use of credit cards and the (false) sense of security they provide.

BUT with that said:  1MB was just a temporary anti-spam stop-gap.
Now I understand 8GB tomorrow would be a problem.  But 8MB?   Come-on you have to be kidding me, WTF!  Even the Chinese pools signed onto that, and they have crappy internet.  It was pretty much theymos and his band that killed the XT experiment, IMNSHO, because of FUD.
Just because you "allow" 8MB blocks does not mean you can't soft-limit lower for those pools that choose to do so.
This debate has been extremely skewed, its not even about the size debate anymore but who controls BTC.  So maybe in that sense the core devs are rightfully ignoring it.   But then you realize when we hit $500 and under NORMAL conditions we max'd out 1MB!

Most miners don't get free power unfortunately.
And that means profitability really won't be around after the halving!  Just the cost to break even on power usage means one need less than $0.5/KWH power soon enough, even with an S7.  Forget any overhead!
Some combination of price rise (we just saw $450&gt;$550), combined with unprofitable miners dropping out (i.e. most of the deployed hashrate today) will make up for the halving most likely.  But new gear like the rumored Antminer S9 are a wildcard!
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:51:40
Just wait, we'll get there.  You just defended a nearly $5 fee.  
That's the whole point.  For this to succeed you really can't be  $1/$5/$whatever.  This should be pennies.  There is no reason for the network to be limited to 3.5 TPS.  The cost per transaction is way too high.  That is a major disadvantage, and will allow Alts to gain market share (which they are doing quickly).

The new S7 is amazing at 4.8TH with only 1.2kw draw and right now they are 3.8BTC.  But again you won't want to spend time next to it.
If you pay for power you need CHEAP rates.   Under $0.10/kwh for sure. $0.07 is better!
The only quiet miners will be the obsolete ones.  Unless this is just a hobby or you have free power its just not worth it for pennies per day.

Cool idea right?  Practical?  Well, not so much, read on:
I've been garage/house mining for years.  In the summer things are in the garage, in the winter I move them into the house.
The problem is pretty much all noise related.  When I was using first gen Avalon's I would draw about 1600W but at 3000 RPM the fans sound like a hairdryer/vacuum.  10W/GH efficiency.   Those lived in my laundry room and it was constantly 85+ degrees in there.
Then I moved on to 16x AntMiner S1s.  2W/GH efficiency.  Less noise than the Avalons, but the real deal was under-volting them.  You could drop power usage in half, and still get 140GH (resulting in 1.2W/Gh efficiency).  And man it was amazing, practically silent!  Maybe like a gaming PC on idle.  KnC Jupiters were also plenty quiet but not very efficient.
But starting with the last couple of generations, it's pretty much unbearable on the noise these days.  AntMiner S5 (0.5W/Gh) could theoretically be underclocked but it requires a power supply that can go lower than 12V (ie 10V).  Otherwise have fun with that hairdryer sound 24/7!  Spondoolies SP20E on the other hand had great voltage/OC control, so those would be the only miner "today" I could recommend as a home heater.  Still it won't be profitable.
The "about to be eclipsed" Antminer S7 of today runs 0.25W/GH efficiency but pretty much is a 1300W hair dryer on full blast, maybe even louder.  Heck people have had them in their garage and their *neighbor* complains it is too loud!

The value isn't in the TPS, the MW of power use is just the cost of the largest immutable ledger ever known.  Sidechains are for TPS!
Besides, BOA saved 2.5MW by making 275 locations more energy efficient out of 5100 total locations.  They also have a building that has its own 4.5MW generator in building (that only generates 65% of its power, its all new LEDs inside!)

Yeah this sort of thing happens in the Pacific Northwest also.  Mostly because a bunch of windfarms were brought online in the past few years and combined with all the hydro there is actually quite a surplus of power.  And giszmo is correct end-consumers never actually see the "free" power - in fact in the PNW "customers" ultimately get to subsidize the wind power owners and pay them for power they never generated because of how messed up the industry has gotten:

@_date: 2017-05-24 02:47:46


Exactly.  This is what was supposed to happen LAST YEAR but Devs and Pools had a big e-peen contest...
The Chinese beat everyone else at the mining game.  US, Russian, and Swedish chips were obsolete by the time they were released pretty much.
And honestly, the Chinese have put a big chunk of change into Bitcoin.  Devs are English speaking, and from "Western" countries so there is some kind of "F-those guys" attitude from Core.
You catch more flies with honey than vinegar.  That was previously the whole amazing accomplishment of Bitcoin:  It was better to work together for the common good than to hold out and spoil it for everyone.
That is the innocence bitcoin has currently lost unfortunately!
@_date: 2016-05-19 17:44:44
Andreas remains one of the smartest visionaries in Bitcoin.
The halving will be interesting.  Only an S7 with say $0.03-5/KWH power will be profitable in farms.  No 16nm designs are "breakthough" efficient yet, and have only managed to "match" Antminer's current 28nm S7 efficiency.
Rumor has it the S9 is right around the corner!
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:06:32


I dunno, I disagree with that being the "only way".
10mb blocksize plus segwit would be I dunno, 20 cent fees maybe today? 
I believe we need all the things, off-chain, on-chain, segwit, bigger blocks, etc to make this happen!

Luke I've been around a long time with you mining since 2011.  The whole Core vs Pools standoff has been crazy, second only perhaps to the MtGox meltdown.
A letter was signed by the major pools a long while ago now it seems supporting essentially SW+2MB so it really makes sense.
Glad some middle ground exists.  Now to get everyone on board to execute.

Hate to be the bearer of bad news:  Chinese won man.  How many new miners do you see Spondoolies, KnC, and Bitfury creating these days?
As it was put in another post, we have the choice between Raspberry Pis and $3/transaction fees or datacenters and $0.01 fees.  We are chosing the Rasbperry Pi and keeping it's "third world dialup compatible" technology wise.  Problem is, $3/transaction fees are exactly what is helping out the competing coins IMNSHO!  And $3 fees means you can forget about the third world in general.  
So in Bitcoin we are stuck arguing if $3/transaction or $1.50/transaction (segwit) is appropriate.  Jihan says there are 3 million datacenters in the ~~world~~ USA, why can't we make it $0.01 again and settle for 3+ million options as "diverse enough" instead?
@_date: 2015-10-21 22:29:48
Mining is a losing game.  A new Antminer S7 is 4x more efficient.  1TH makes what like $1.50/day minus power costs which could easily be more than that depending on power rate and which miner!  Not really worth mining at home for pennies IMHO. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:19:40
Nah, Core will just reject the changes anyway.
@_date: 2016-05-17 00:46:53
Well I had $0.06/KWH in the beginning but with rate increases and all fees/taxes/recovery/etc and being on a "residential" plan it's closer to $0.10 now.  Since you use 100x more electricity than I do obviously you're in a good location for commercial cheaper-than-dirt power.  I could move a few counties over and find power rates equal to yours (only a couple places in the USA really get down that low) , but for two S7s?  Naww...

For the record I never check but I've been in bitcoin a LONG time and let me comment on a few counter points you have given:
*"Miner's are really gonna struggle after the halving, they are already struggling at this price level!" Yeah? How about that whole fucking year spent at around $230 where the hashrate just kept on growing? The price is double now. Do I really need to do that math for you to show that current price could easily sustain them through a reward drop?"*
As a miner since 2011, you need to realize $230 bitcoins were when difficulty was 4x easier than now.  So sorry ... but to a miner that's the equivalent of $920 bitcoin price today!  I have provided the calculations in the previous threads on here, but if you have the BEST miner released 7 months ago (2x more efficient than previous gen, the S7) the cost to "cover electricity alone" break even point goes from $0.14/KWH to $0.07/KWH.  Basically long story short is a bunch of equipment is about to be turned off unless the price goes up quite a bit!
*"It's in everyone's best interest to switch away from Core!" Yeah? Then why the fuck is no one doing it? Why the fuck did nobody even give classic a try?!*
Things in opensource land take time.  As soon as Core was beginning to be tried nodes were DDOS'd.  Its amazing how opinions can be changed when there are severe penalties attached.

15% signalling for UASF of all nodes -- maybe you don't understand!
If UASF was 60% then this would be a real discussion.  But it's not!  Right now UASF is the "coup" regardless...
People that think UASF is a reality with 15% of nodes but say BU is unrealistic at 40% of hashrate are just whack... that's all!

@_date: 2016-05-17 23:20:49
Forget 51/49 split for a minute, lets go with the 90/10 example:
So the way to deal with a hardfork is to create another hardfork?
I love luke's math! 
So 90% hardfork off (100% consensus there using luke's math), 9% have to hardfork and fix their hashpower issues so their network doesn't halt (another 100% consensus), and the remaining 1% that never update anything have 100% consensus on that and that coin never finds another block!  Great!
Now we have 3 different coins, all with 100% consensus.  300% consensus, how can that not be good?!    /s
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:51:25
Oh I was talking more about Core 1mb "forever" stance they essentially have stuck to vs *everyone else that wants any kind of blocksize increase*.  I see SW as a nice bonus, but somewhat of a red herring in the hardfork debate.  Scale all the ways!
While a lot of people have blood on their hands in this whole fiasco, I didn't see the Pool's request for SW + small increase as unreasonable (more like inevitable, and SW can be implemented better with a HF anyway) but Core basically went ape...

Its really not worth my time replying, but the whole idea of bitcoin was it's better to work with the network than against it.
Devs coded software, miners and nodes ran it, at some point it would gain majority, we'd move on to the next thing.
Now we've been stuck in this 1mb hellhole debate for fucking years?
Call it coincidence or whatever you want man, I'd rather have Core do their fucking job and I'm just pissed about everyone's power grab here, fuck Roger too for all I care, start goddamn moving already and prove the point that these Alts will go the way of Doge.
The best part of the bitcoin concept back in the day was ultimately deflationary money and the concept that if any alts came up with "better" ideas we could just port that into Bitcoin and regain the edge.
At this point, we are failing hard at that second part.

Well you choose to join and consent, or discontinue use of Bitcoin. 
Miners make the blocks.  If you have 90% of hashpower on one chain and 10% on another you don't have 100% consensus, you just removed 10% of the network from playing in the sandbox!  Unless you think that 10% will put up with a 2-hour blocktime until difficulty resets in perhaps half a year!

LOL man, I'm a miner and this thread title depressed me instantly but this made me laugh.  "just making hay while the sun still shines"  &lt;  THIS.  EXACTLY THIS.
So today I have 2x Antminer S7, and make about 0.023 BTC/day.  That is 0.69 coins per month, or $310 at today's BTC/$ price.
But to run that requires 2600 watts of continuous power draw.  So at $0.10/KWH (pretty low power rate) it costs $187 in power!
Well guess what happens in 8 weeks?
I'll be spending $187 to make $155 in bitcoin per month if everything holds.  And I have the most efficient gear publicly available purchased at the end of last year!

@_date: 2017-05-18 23:16:46
Part of the roadmap they keep ignoring!  Not really sure how kicking the HF can down the road does us any good...
Hardfork + SW would be fine with the pools/miners.  But Core went out of their way to NOT do that, and now its all Bitmain's fault?  
I just see it as a pissing match.  Core wants control.  Bitmain doesn't want to lose 30% hashrate overnight.   The fact core *insists* upon doing SW-only at first means they give some of the biggest investors into bitcoin the middle finger.  They didn't have to do that, they *chose* to do that, and here we are!

As a miner, this seems like an "okay" article.  I liked the getwork vs stratum part, not many people realize the difference or have even heard of the different mining protocols.
Miners don't verify transactions in reality, it's really the pools that do.  Miners just "win the lottery" by solving the bitcoin problem for whatever particular pool they are a member.  The pool combines that winning answer with the pending transactions on the network (mempool) to "turn in" the answer to the bitcoin network as a whole and get "paid".
Its like the individual miners find the actual answer to the bitcoin problem and then the pool says "oh and here's the transactions we are going to include with this answer".
This is why the whole blocksize debate pissed me off from the beginning - allowing for a greater maximum size does not require any pool or miner to actually generate a block of that max size.  We could have a 20mb limit with actual 2mb max blocks being found for years and it wouldn't be a problem...

Major releases of new chips are always odd-numbered with Antminer.
So S1, S3, S5, S7 were all new chips.  Then "if" they do an even-numbered release it's just higher density.  (i.e. the S2 is the same chips as the S1 but does 1TH instead of 180GH - both had about the same efficiency)

*&gt; The best way to neuter Bitcoin is to centralize it. The bandwidth and processing power required settle each and every coffee purchase on blockchain would effectively centralize it into a handful of nodes. Then Bitcoin has become nothing but an inefficient centralized payment system that nobody wants. It would simply be the end of Bitcoin.*
So we keep a laughable 3.5TPS network alive for $1Million/day in payments (sorry, *rewards* to miners)?  Yes we need lightning for VISA levels but there currently is just no room to grow today.
1MB today without spam seems sufficient but tomorrow it won't be if bitcoin is to succeed.  We don't need the blockchain so lightweight it has to run on a  RaspbPi2!  China (with the shitty fw) was fine with 8MB blocks, Galvin started at 20.  1MB proponents will relegate Bitcoin to a niche technology.  That in my mind is failure.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:38:16


IMNSHO 1mb blocksize that should have been upgraded years ago.  While I like Segwit, it's only part of the solution.


TL;DR:  Dick measuring contest that Core started which has blown up into a stalemate for too many reasons to list...  2mb + Segwit was promised and agreed by most everyone at one time, and then Core gave everyone the finger on that basically (said no no, we have altered the deal, you get SW-only).
Back in the day Devs created the software, Miners and Nodes ran the software, and when things looked good the new version became the defacto standard.
Now there is soo much bad blood in the waters the biggest risk to Bitcoin IS the community itsself!
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:45:16
I figure with cheap power and an S7 miners still are making 4-5x power cost vs BTC generated.  Right now an S7 mines about 1BTC/month (well before that 10% hit!)
Last gen gear (from January 2015 - crazy how mining-time flies!) with the depressed coin value -- even with cheap power -- was in danger slipping below a factor of 2x power cost.  That means those with expensive power are breaking even or losing money already on existing gear.
Mining has always been a gamble that some choose to take.  Most people, aka large majority of home miners, lose money.  Since GPU days mining has been hit or miss, mostly miss due to borderline thieves like Hashfast, BFL, KnC, Cointerra, and Avalon.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:56:38


Hey I'm with you on Bitmain hate with the boost shit, but here's the issue 2mb is still TOO SMALL!
Bigger blocks AND Segwit ARE BOTH NECESSARY!  
I guess it boils down to what do you consider a reasonable fee?  The pools signed a letter for Segwit + blocksize.  Core didn't deliver.  So now I'm pissed at Core AND Bitmain.  Great!  But I don't like BU ether, I just want Core to figure their shit out...

Umm, not really.  
User nodes don't find blocks, just propagate them.  BIP 91 locks in with 80% of BLOCKS, not nodes.
Yes you are signalling segwit with a BIP148 UASF node, but technicaly it has no direct impact in regards to: *"more likely BIP91 is to happen."*

What you are talking about is a network split.  There are lots of examples/discussion of how those can work out.  Ultimately the longest chain wins and the other chain is discarded.
However if just one city was disconnected from the network, the reality is no new blocks would be found on that "local" chain as all the hashpower is hosted globally.
Miners join pools, and pools ultimately create the blocks on the network.  In reality it just would be a local outage until connectivity is restored and transactions have a chance to catch up!

Of course Core has done great things.  I think the initial issue many had with Core was the balking at even a 2mb blocksize increase and throwing a little FUD out there just for good measure (remember: 
 we need *smaller* blocks as 1MB is *too big*!).  But a crypto devs job IS TO BE paranoid, so in reality they are doing their job quite well.
You just can't make all people happy all the time.  Many armchair bitcoin affectionados saw no problem with 1MB every 10 minutes vs 2MB every 10 minutes, Satoshi's whitepaper even addresses the concerns and points out "If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. "
So to many bitcoin early adopters, Core's refusal to scale was a bit surprising if not even antithesis to the Bitcoin whitepaper and mantra.
But as the first crypto currency I see the value in their caution above all else.  MtGox alone set us back a few years, the less chance of fuckups the better!

Miner profitability is a snapshot in time, related to difficulty, cost of gear/running it/efficiency, and bitcoin price.
You guys keep referring to $200 BTC but that was a generation of mining equipment ago, with much different calculations for each.  
Margins are slimmer now then they have been in a LOOONG time.  I can only say that because I've owned every generation ASIC and keep track of these things!  (Avalon, Bitfury, Antminer, ASICMiner, RockMiner, Spondoolies, etc)
Cut the current rate in half when margins are already razor thin?  Yeah that's why I'm saying a bloodbath is a possibility!  Certain?  No.  My guess is the price will rise enough to alleviate the issue, so  only maybe 20% drop out...
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:10:08


Under 15% of the network is signalling BIP148.
Hardly a "bumpy ride", more like "failed to gain adoption".
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:30:56




No not really.  With zero blocks, there is no Bitcoin.  If 80% of the hashpower moves, the 20% left would be left with a block slowdown that would essentially halt the lesser network (without yet another fork by them).
Pools in the past were always the leaders when it came to upgrading.  They determined the pace, the roadmap of when to generate the newer blocks.
The other nodes just validate the blocks.  They don't generate them.  If they don't validate the blocks that have 80% of the hashpower behind them, then they are antithesis to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:57:03

Yeah I've been confused by this whole debate.  Bitcoin has always been a majority rules/winner takes all approach.  (why do you think pools were created in the first place?)

Miner here.  Have been since 2011.
So we've had unintentional "forks" before.  Back in 2013 Client v0.7 vs Client v0.8 disagreed on block 225430 and it took emergency action by the largest pools to save the network.
But this proposed change is very different from that scenario,  as this time only after a large majority consensus is reached and a certain block has been reached (ie time passed) would the larger block size take effect.  (a bug discovered after that could still happen though)
But "how fast" that adoption takes place is directly affected by the miners, or more specifically the pools.  Because pools actually turn over the answers, individual miners don't necessarily have to upgrade but the pool owners definitely need to.
Thus its not the miners per say, but anyone running a "full node" and specifically the big pool owners:
What is very different now from 2013 however is we have 40% of the hashing power owned by Chinese farms (f2/discus fish, btcchina, antpool) so if something were to go wrong, it does make me wonder how fast the pool operators could react.
In 2013 what really saved the network was BTCGuild, at that time the largest pool, reverted from 0.8 to 0.7 which caused that chain to become longer and thus win-out, otherwise it would have been a very long split and when consensus fails repeatedly for a while very bad things happen!

I've been a miner since 2011.  Went from GPUs to Gen1 ASICs (original Avalon), through Bitfury chips, Bitmain S1s through S7s, even Spondoolies.  Even with cheap power under $0.07KWH, ROI (breaking even) has been hit or miss.
Right now Alt Coins with GPUs provide me a 7x "cost of power" return while the S7s are less than 2x (for every $5 in power I spend I make $10 in bitcoin, while Alts are spend $5 in power and make $35 in crypto!) 
I'm a believer in bitcoin, so I use NiceHash to convert my alts instantly into BTC, but there is no more "meat on bone" with bitcoin mining.  Huge farms in China with less than $0.03/KWH power and dirt-cheap chip/miner deals us westerners covet mean SHA-256 hashes are largely being centralized in China.

Based on the cost to mine a coin with just electricity, anything under $200 and miners are really hurting.  Heck CEX.IO said their "cost" to create a Bitcoin was $320!
You think the big Chinese farms with $80K/month power bills will mine at a loss?  
Yes difficulty will correct slowly, but there is still a "force" to keep the price of a coin inline with at least the raw power cost to create that coin.  How do I know this?  Well I've been mining since 2011 with various gear and a relatively "low" power cost of $0.06/KWH and this isn't the first time this has happened.  I remember when it cost $2 in power to create a $3.50 coin.

As a miner since 2011, John is somewhat right, but there a definite lag - the price changes much more often than once every 2 weeks!  And difficulty rarely goes DOWN, most always UP.

Not saying thats gonna happen, but its a possibility, one of many!

Yeah I'm a miner and this halving sucks just like the last one for me, but difficulty is the real variable that make and break miners and most people have no clue about.
Difficulty is now 4x higher than it was a year ago, so we've already had the equivalent of TWO HALVINGs in the past 365 days!
@_date: 2016-05-17 07:45:25
You missed a variable called difficulty.  And didn't consider miner generations (i.e. efficiency).
Difficulty alone was 4x easier back when coins were in the $200 range in 2015.  Of course back then I was using an Antminer S5 that also took twice the power per GH!

I am confused why a youtube video of an S9 sitting there running is upvoted.  Now if this was posted before they were released or something that would be interesting, but there are many of these in the wild today.  And yes they are LOUD!
While the S9 is an amazing piece of hardware, the purchase price is much higher than it will ever return.  Bitmain is just waiting for suckers to buy thinking difficulty has stalled.  What will really happen is at some point they will start to drop the price like a rock, bringing soo much new hashpower online early buyers will get screwed as difficulty skyrockets.  Right now they are the only game in town with efficient chips, so they pretty much control the market!
See:  The less than 1-year old S7 that originally sold for 4+ BTC, now sells for less than 0.6 BTC.  And even today the S7 will LOSE money every month if you pay anything over $0.11/KWH for power!

Text from the PayWall:
By DAVID ZEILER, Contributing Writer, Money Morning • May 31, 2016
A sudden and dramatic spike in the Bitcoin price has pundits everywhere hunting for an explanation.
While the price of Bitcoin had fared well over the past 12 months, more than doubling from the lows of last August, the latest surge pushed the digital currency to a two-year high.
Once the Bitcoin price broke through resistance at $460, a level that had served as a barrier over and over since December, it raced to $500 and beyond.
Bitcoin price 
A week ago, the Bitcoin price was about $445. Starting on Friday, the price of Bitcoin began to move up. It breached $500 on Saturday and $540 on Sunday. The Bitcoin price has leveled off and pulled back a little since, but today (Tuesday) is hovering around $530.
At the peak of the run, the price of Bitcoin had soared more than 20% in just three days.
But such a steep move must have cause. And it's something we've seen in the past…
Why the Bitcoin Price Is Soaring
Bitcoin buying in China suddenly increased in recent days. And make no mistake, China dominates world Bitcoin trading.
Many people don't realize China's importance to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite restrictions imposed in 2014, the Chinese government never banned Bitcoin outright. China-based Bitcoin miners account for about three-quarters of all Bitcoin miners.
Over the past 30 days, trading between Bitcoin and the Chinese yuan has accounted for 93% of all Bitcoin trades, according to Bitcoincharts.com. By comparison, trading between Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar accounted for just 6%.
bitcoin buying in China
As volume spiked on Friday and Saturday, the Bitcoin price on the Chinese Bitcoin exchanges raced ahead of prices in other currencies. At one point the spread between Chinese Bitcoin exchange Huobi and the London-based Bitstamp Bitcoin exchange was $70.
As Bitcoin prices worldwide caught up, the spread shrank. As of today, that spread is about $14.
So there's no doubt that Chinese traders drive Bitcoin prices. Buy why are the Chinese buying Bitcoin now?
Some of it has to do with what's going on in China, of course. But some of it has to do with events in the United States…
Why the Chinese Have Embraced Bitcoin
Some underlying forces driving China's appetite for Bitcoin have been true for a long time, but several things have happened recently to push demand higher.
For example, Bitcoin is an ideal way for the Chinese to evade their government's use of capital controls to restrict yuan from leaving the country. Once yuan are converted to Bitcoin, the money can be sent virtually anywhere in the world.
The Chinese also enjoy speculation and gambling, which is one reason Bitcoin became an instant hit there back in 2013. In China, Bitcoin is more widely viewed as an investment that will at some point deliver a big payoff.
Likewise, Chinese investors are always hunting for the best returns, and quickly sour on underperforming classes. When the Chinese real estate market started to tank, this group bailed. In the past year, such asset classes as commodities and stocks have also disappointed.
That's steadily pushed more yuan into Bitcoin, particularly in recent months.
With such steady demand as a constant, it doesn't take much to drive a spike in the price of Bitcoin…
Three Reasons Bitcoin Demand in China Is Soaring Now
Here's what's making Chinese buyers even more eager to buy Bitcoin now:
Less supply, higher prices: Most people who follow Bitcoin are aware that the reward earned by the miners for solving a block will drop in half July 11, from 25 bitcoins to just 12.5. The 50% decline in supply in the face of rising demand will put upward pressure on the Bitcoin price, and Chinese investors know it.
Weak yuan: A weaker yuan, particularly against the U.S. dollar, is bad news for wealthy Chinese who hold a lot of yuan. The surprise devaluation of the yuan last summer put Chinese investors on notice. And lately, they've had more to worry about.
The yuan fell 1.6% against the greenback in May, its biggest one-month drop since last August. It now sits at a five-year low. And with the Chinese economy continuing to slow, more yuan devaluations are probably in the cards.
Chinese concerned about losing value see a safe haven in Bitcoin. By converting yuan to Bitcoin, they not only avoid losing value as the yuan weakens, but gain value as the Bitcoin price rises.
A Fed rate hike: In the past week, the yuan got more bad news: the increasing possibility of another U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike, perhaps just weeks away. A Fed rate hike will further strengthen the dollar, adding to the downward pressure on the yuan.
Several Fed governors have been making "hawkish" speeches lately. But a comment from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday could have been the spark that pushed the recent Bitcoin-buying frenzy to new heights.
"It's appropriate … for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time, and probably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate," Yellen said in a talk at Harvard University.
At that point, the Bitcoin price had moved up, but hesitated at about $475. Hours after the Yellen speech, the Bitcoin price started to take off.
OK, so the Chinese are buying Bitcoin. What happens now?
Wider demand for Bitcoin will continue to grow, driven mainly by the digital currency's ability to disrupt the financial industry.
And supply will continue to shrink. The halving of the reward in July is the third in Bitcoin's history. Future halvings will occur every three to four years until Bitcoin reaches its 21 million-coin limit in 2140.
The increasing pervasiveness of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, will continue to drive the Bitcoin price higher over time. There will be pullbacks, of course, but the long-term trend will be positive.
That's why two Wall Street firms have high expectations for the price of Bitcoin in the coming years. Needham &amp; Co. sees Bitcoin going to $1,896 by 2020. And Wedbush Securities has estimated Bitcoin will reach $17,473 by 2025.
The Bottom Line: The sudden, 20% jump in the Bitcoin price over the past week can be traced back to buying in China. The Chinese became interested in the digital currency back in 2013 and now are responsible for more than 90% of the world's Bitcoin trading. Economic trouble in China almost always leads to a spike in Bitcoin. And with the yuan under increasing pressure lately, it should be no surprise that the Bitcoin price is surging.

Yeah too bad they went under.  I had a couple SP20 and loved those miners!

Check your math!  $500 for an SP20 that burns $86/month in power but only makes $114 in coins!  Your ROI is basically never  :(   Sell that miner and buy Bitcoins instead!  I guarantee you will end up with more coins in the end.
(assume:  1KW * $0.12USD * 24hrs * 30Days = $86USD,  says 1.5TH will generate "per Month 0.51649108 BTC $114.68")

Yeah it gets as low as $0.03 to $0.04 in the best part of the USA and China.  However that is not the norm by any means, and is the bottom of the market.  Plenty of miners paying $0.07 to $0.08 which means they are getting squeezed pretty tight right now!   Remember it costs more than just power to run a big mine.  So that is why the hashrate is finally dropping!

Yep but those of us paying attention called that in the beginning.  No one needs an obsolete chip chewing extra power in their home router.   It is always cheaper to load a "lifetime" supply of coins on the box when it is produced than draw $10/year to make $1/year in BTC.
P.S. They may still be mining, but probably with a bigger pool.
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:16:08
I think it's mostly the fact that Chelan/Grant County PUD for a long time was labelled as "the cheapest power in the US" and it ac
So miners began flocking there, but with the pace ASICs go obsolete first time investors quite often get too far behind the curve.  PUD has low power rates because they want to draw industrial/commercial that would bring JOBS with it.  The concern is, a shoestring budget mining operation that is fly-by-night won't pay its bills and will add little to no overall impact to the local economy.
"Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, Chelan County PUD moved to a flat residential rate for **electricity of just 2.7 cents per kilowatt hour**. That's one of the lowest rates in the nation. This new approach to rates will lower bills for most residential customers."

Local Bitcoins is like the Craigslist of BTC.  You gotta watch you back!  New guy with no previous trades, asking for $8k?  LOL no thanks.  How much of a premium was he paying for the coins?  Probably a tipoff right there!
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:43:25
At this point the network is big enough that a 51% attack is impossible by any one actor, and it would take multiple mining pools colluding to perform the attack.  (which they won't do because that would destroy the network)
The scary part is the electricity cost to mint brand new coin is quickly approaching parity or has already exceeded the exchange price - CEX.IO stated it costs them $320 to mine a BTC!
ROI on the newest/most efficient ASIC mining gear is already near 1-year mark (from around ~3-4 month average previously) if it ROI's at all, so anyone jumping in now is pretty much gambling.
I've been mining since 2011 and the last time margins were this thin was back when it cost me $2 in power to make a $3.50 coin.  We are at the tipping point and if coins continue further downward into the $100s NO ONE will be making money mining.
Those who are still buying mining gear are just proving "a sucker is born every minute"!

Not sure what you consider "extremely profitable" or "decent electricity cost".  Price for power varies widely, but most midwest miners are around $0.07/KWH which means 2/3rds of Bitcoin mined goes towards paying for power.   And forget mining in any of the major East Coast/West Coat cities , you are losing money if you pay over $0.11/KWH for power!

"In 2014, the interest from the bitcoin sector went bananas. The Chelan utility received 34 inquiries representing 220 MW of capacity, compared to the 1 to 3 megawatts of load requests the agency fields in a normal year."
"Many data centers in U.S. markets would be thrilled to buy power at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. But in the current environment, with American miners competing against huge bitcoin operations in China and the Baltics, the Eastern Washington bitcoiners say the price hike from 3 to 5 cents torpedoes their economics."

I mined almost 1000 coins with a dozen GPUs in the garage.  Mined coins for $3 sold them for $6.  Took my last 100BTC and bought an Avalon which only mined 50BTC.
But those who got suckered into BFL had it worse!  And I'm a sucker because I kept mining with newer ASICs, some making a little some losing...  Still have two S7s today but since they were batch 1/2 they cost me 4-6BTC each!  They did mine back their original investment, if I forget about the $150/month in power I feed them  :(
ASIC mining is basically a break-even proposition or maybe 10% profit.  If I had been mining with GPUs on ALTs this past few years I would have made BANK instead.
But you are right ultimately, mining is just a small way to make *some* coin, but the profit has always been in the increase in coin prices, not mining!

LBC is a PITA, and the only people who use it are those who can't or won't use a better method.  Probably because drugs.

Cmon n1nj4, You know the answer to this!  *Would you spend $1.50 on power to make $1 in Bitcoin?*  NO you would just BUY BITCOIN instead!
Right now if you have a less-than-1-year old S7 ASIC (basically the second most efficient miner available after the brand new S9) the **S7 BREAK EVEN power cost today is currently around $0.11/KWH!**  So if you pay more than that for power it's still cheaper to turn off your miner and just buy coins (today)!
For what it's worth, the hashpower leaving the network now is probably older Spondoolies and S5 or even S3 miners.  They are much less efficient, and require power costs of $0.05 to $0.03 to just break even.  So they are essentially OBSOLETE now!

That's just like YOUR OPINION MAN!  I say the same thing to those wanting to buy a miner.  You have to find a deal that makes it worthwhile, and that takes a lot of hunting and a bit of timing.
I like hardware.  I started mining for free video cards.  I find it an entertaining hobby.
After all, I gained nearly a thousand BTC with mining investing only a few hundred USD here and there on a new card/system/psu whatever.  And I would eventually spend BTC.  Remember for a long time (years) BTC was stagnant in the $7-15 range.
So to take the last 10% I had saved, and "roll the dice" on ASICs seemed like the only chance to ever get "more" than 100 BTC.  Holding just isn't any fun.  Heck I don't care if I could have made 101 BTC, at least make the initial investment back!
Some of the ASICs have had a decent return.  But the big initial loss due to the flat out audacity of BFL and Avalon to knowingly lie through their teeth makes the whole deal a farce.

And it worked for them!  I think we should fork MTGOX losses out of Bitcoin!

Naw, the "real" flippening happened when Core ousted the visionaries in the group and proceeded to bikeshed the fuck out of Bitcoin and make it "by developers for developers".
Remember guys, even 1MB is "too big!"
"Scale all the ways" was too scary of a concept, and may be where ETH eventually fails if Core's doomsday predictions ultimately prove correct, but Bitcoin's failure to scale so far is the current dilemma that has allowed the alts to get even in the same ballpark...
My vision for Bitcoin was much bigger than Theymos or Core's vision.  If Satoshi were to ever come out of hiding I'd love to hear his words on the subject today!

No I am complaining about manufacturers because they took X Bitcoin from me with a promise to deliver the goods in a reasonable timeframe which would have at least returned my initial investment X plus a little (or maybe a lot) more.  But instead they waited until the maximum BTC I could mine with the product was some small fraction of X... and they did this ON PURPOSE to let their friends get the early profits!
Lets put it this way, one single miner I have operating its useful life will lose over 40BTC alone.  Many others have lost a lot more (BFL Anyone?)

This is definitely a poker game.  Honestly Miners BIP 91 and SW2X is an interesting play, really both sides are bluffing and this is a slightly uncomfortable compromise to get SW out now to avoid an immediate fork and kick the real fight down the road for the bigger 2X fork in Nov.
But *how* you have just painted the picture is the crux of the issue.  Your stance is UASF is the users, while 2X is only the miners.  What if I told you plenty of users are fine, and even want the concept of 2X.  People discount China as just miners, but there are plenty of users there also.  UASF sitting at 15% of nodes today (which can easily be run by regular users if they wished) makes me think actual support for it is much less than what seems to be portrayed around these parts sometimes!

PROFITABLE?  LOL HECK NO!
Do this:  
Put in:  Diff 5%, Power $0.07USD/kWh, 13TH, HW Price 3.2BTC, 1300W and calculate!
OH FUN IT SEEMS LIKE I ROI IN LIKE 4MONTHS!   Wait a sec, Bock Reward - drop that to 12.5 BTC - OH SHIT, ROI is NEVER!
Do not buy a S9 right now and think you can make a profit!  Bitmain always does this.

Yeah and we have two accounts talking about it that seem a bit phishy!
How to scam with Bitcoin:
1.  Create fake website
2.  Create fake review (11BTC to a unknown site?  lol - oh now I see that post is DELETED)
3.  Push "time limited offer" to make it seem urgent
4.  Involve PayPal payments which are easily reversed

I mined through the last halving.  I'll probably mine through this one for a little, but once my gear is clearly unprofitable it either gets shut down or sold.  Might as well take that money I put into electricity and buy coins instead!

"...does not currently support ETHC withdrawals, although they've said they will eventually."
Yep Coinbase's plan is to wait for ETC to become worthless so then no one cares anyway...
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:38:14
Probably MTGOX  :P
EDIT:  Downvotes for being right?  Jeez you newbie Bitcoiners have no concept that MTGOX was nearly the ONLY exchange people used in the early days.

Strictly speaking, that is how bitcoin was designed.   
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:31:02
Back when it was $3/coin throwing around numbers like $1000 seemed pretty delusional too at the time, but I witnessed it do just that.  Orders of magnitude growth is still possible!

Do you want fire?  Because that's how you get fire!
Think about it this way:
"Why does your CPU need a heatsink/fan when you could just leave that off?"
The kicker:  These bitcoin mining rigs draw 1300W instead of 50W like your CPU!

My bitcoins were mined for $3 and most all sold @ $6.
So yeah, for those freaking out right now, go look at the coinbase price charts for 1 year and get some perspective!

Sorry bro, miners in CHINA running the HUGE MINES don't give a F about SEGWIT, BIP-whatever, ASICBOOST, or anyone opinion here.
Bitmain makes the most efficient gear for the cheapest price.

6-8 weeks of bad news bears and panicked investors isn't something Bitcoin needs.  
The results would be brutal, no one wins in the end except alts.

If he is a day trader then he is kind of forced to keep at least some coins available at a moments whim, but otherwise he needs to get a Trezor!

While you can, at one point a big Chinese pool broke down their ratio of hashpower by country.  It was pretty much all from inside the country  - all I remember for sure is USA was around 2%!   So while you *can* mine on a Chinese pool from outside they are the leader by far and to claim otherwise is disingenuous.

I used to use intersango simply because I could get BTC&gt;USD Dwolla (yeah funny I am US-based and used a UK exchange) within just a few minutes instead of a few days.  I loved them.
They stopped trading a long time ago.
Although if I could go back in time I solid hundreds of coins for under $10 on there so hindsight is always 20/20.   ;)

Since ASICs arrived I took my last 100 BTC and currently have 1TH + 20BTC in the bank to show for it... don't think I'll even get it back to the original 100!  
Today is the day I can say I would have been a Bitcoin Millionaire.  Mined 800+ coins on DeepBit with a dozen+ video cards 2011-2012.  Sold most trying to use "bitcoin like cash"  :/  (hey that was the idea... RIGHT GUYS?  Guys???)
The biggest disappointment:  Preorders.  F-those greedy manufacturers and their "delays"...
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:54:10
If you think r/bitcoin is cool and you have time to burn I would recommend visiting bitcointalk forums and reading those forums that interest you (mining, market speculation, etc).  The more you know the better, and I can say I've made a lot more bitcoins with information gleaned there than than anywhere else   ;)  
... oh wait what am I saying don't let the cat out of the bag please downvote!
@_date: 2013-10-20 17:44:15
Well ASIC companies have priced their products right on the "edge" of ROI on purpose.  They want to sell as much gear as possible for as much money as possible, but no one will buy if its obviously too expensive.
The only real "deals" were Avalon Batch 1 &amp; 2, and more recently the Avalon Mini for 60GH @ 2.2BTC for those "in the know".

I also have been mining for years, and the "average joe" will lose money 10/10 times with ASICs.
I had a Avalon Batch 2 preorder, and that was nominally successful.  Batch 3 is a 50 BTC loss or so.
Yifu messed up and let the 60GH Avalon Mini's go to auction for 2-3BTC so I just bought 8.6KW of those only because they were so cheap, and I will have them in hand next week.
But I digress.  The real reason this post is borked is due to the calculation blockchain uses:  it assumes GPU mining with an average power cost.  Basically its saying right now you will spend over 7x on the amount of power than a GPU would cost to operate.  
Its not accurate in the ASIC world but still goes to show how much the margins are shrinking.  And it keeps getting worse and worse.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:51:39
Hey I agree its annoying.  But sometimes public shame is a valid recourse mechanism.
Let me explain.  I've been in in bitcoin since 2011, and while there have been issues in the past with exchanges as converting fiat to/from BTC can always have delays, sometimes exchanges do have genuine bad behavior.
For example:  BTC&gt;BTC should never be delayed, unless you chose not to pay a transaction fee.  But recently MtGox had that issue where cashout of BTC held at Gox was taking DAYS for BTC payments to arrive to another BTC address!  Public shaming was the best recourse, as support tickets were basically canned BS answers. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:47:27
No I've been mining for years and this has been a rough week for everything but the BTC price:
- Huge DDOS attack brought BTCGuild offline briefly which hasn't happened in forever
- Bitcointalk is offline due to hack, this is the center of the bitcoin information universe and a huge loss
- SR is too bad.  Never ordered but I can't believe it was a 29 year old in the USA.  I figured it was more distributed and overseas like TPB.
I guess the only bright side is the fact MtGox didn't lag and trigger a &gt;50% flash crash, which would have been the norm before.
The whole bitcoin is here to stay:  well duh, but still feels a bit like "this is why we can't have nice things..."
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:12:49
No screw gox.  It does NOT take 3+ days to get BTC transfers back up.  They specifically do this to prevent quick transactions between exchanges but when I need my BTC out NOW they randomly decide to hold it hostage.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:55:39
I know.  I just had to cashout BTC to USD to purchase a Rosewill lighting 1300W PS to power my shiny new 400GH miner.  If I could have done native BTC to Newegg I woudn't have chosen Amazon!
