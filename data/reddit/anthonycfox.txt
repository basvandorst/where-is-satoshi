Yep, I needed to wait a half hour also or else it would just be removed again. Thanks!

I love comments like this :)) Like a blind person yelling at people to watch where they're going.

Yeah, I get it now. You can regenerate the deck if someone drops out (minus their hole cards), but if you create an address for the pot using everyone's keys you need them all at the end to distribute it. Ouch. Imagine going all in with the nuts and someone's internet craps out. That would be too painful. So, $100 escrow for $1 ante game? I guess that might work.

Okay, I've been thinking about the "Mental Poker" problem.
What I said in the OP does help with part of it. 
The other part is generating the cards. The solution I've seen mentioned, is for everyone at the table to create a key and all the keys together are used to generate the deck. All the keys need to be present before any cards are dealt.
So, what to do if someone drops out before the hand is decided? Generate new keys and a new deck. The cards being held by the players that are present and the ones on the table can be accounted for. The cards held by the person who dropped out would be unknown, so the new deck would have to have their cards in it and they may be dealt again.
This isn't how poker is traditionally played. However, I don't think this is a terrible problem, as long as people understand that is the way the game works.
Regardless, it wouldn't happen very often and I don't see anyway to use it to cheat. The person who dropped out put their money in the bitcoin address of the pot. They can't renege.

Oh, I guess I didn't look hard enough. I'm probably way out of my depth here, but I could use the mental exercise. Thanks.

Cool. I'm reading "Dialogue With Cypher Poker.." and they are talking about the pot like it is a collection of IOU's to be redeemed when the hand is over. Your name is pokertravis; so I'm sure you understand the pot is like a separate entity. It exists independent of the players. Not even the house controls the pot. And, it's real money. I can't imagine p2p poker working without respecting that fundamental part of the game.

Oops. I just found out about "Mental Poker" and now I see the problem with reneging isn't about money it's about the cards. Never mind. :(
