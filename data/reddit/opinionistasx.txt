(I'm just a random passerby, not an investor/speculator, so take everything I say with a grain of salt).
I'm not sure if the quote by Mandelbrot really applies - It looks like Mandelbrot is talking mostly about about the overall chart pattern superficially appearing to contain trends and bubbles. The last 3 Bitcoin bubbles are beyond superficially similar - take any indicator over the last 3 bubbles and you'll see that they show the same overall structure.
I remember when the last bubble happened:
* At first the Bitcoin subreddit was entirely full of "To The Moon ┗(°0°)┛ ^.^.^○". My thoughs at the moment were - this is a bubble, and it's going to pop, though no one knows when.
* Then we reached the peak and started to crash. The subreddit was spammed with "HOLD!" and that bubble graphic containing the "trendline-bubble-crash-rebound-crash" pattern. My thoughts at the moment were: It's strange that we crashed, but we are still way above the trendline (the more-or-less straight line you can plot over the logarithmic price graph). But, at the moment, I didn't see how it would return to the trendline.
- Then, somehow, it rebound, like in all previous times, though I don't remember exactly the overall mood of the comunity.
- Then all the bad news (hacks, MtGox, etc.) started coming and it has landed pretty much on the overall trendline.
IMO, the pattern over the 3 bubbles exists, because during then there was really no huge professional ubvestor influence in the market, but rather it was a bunch of geeks (except maybe the last one when more general public started coming).
It's human nature: Bitcoin gains Bitcoin gains publicity by some event. Newcomers see Bitcoin is growing exponentially. They begin to pour money and this generates increasing publicity. This follows until potential newcomers run out, then it starts to crash because many of the speculators pull out because they know the others are going to do so. When the crash is over some smartass investors put money again because they believe we've bottomed out and it's undervalued. After this it slowly goes to the mean again because it has been overvalued the whole time.
My personal opinion: The bubble will not repeat again, or at least it will be different, because now Bitcoin is much more mainstream, it requires way more money, and there are tons of serious investors looking into trying to squeeze profits from it. If the bubble psychology were to repeat again, we would see whales buying before the expected bubble started (which would probably kickstart the bubble sooner than the previous ones) and they selling before the expected crash (which would also probably trigger the crash earlier). So in fact the people that believe that the bubble will repeat are the ones that will get fucked this time. But I don't believe it will happen again at all.
What is true IMO is that the price should continue to rise according to the trendline overall unless some radically bad news (e.g. security flaw, bug in Bitcoin clients afecting the network, crazy regulation) comes out, just because the fact that it doesn't happen should increase confidence of Bitcoin as a store-of-value, and there's still new activity coming every day.
