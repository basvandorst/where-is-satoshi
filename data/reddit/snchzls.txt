I swear 9 x 2 = 18. Ask Wolfram alpha.

The character exists. It’s official. ₿

I love the Fold app and using bitcoin for purchases has been awesome for me (because I monitor my “realized gain” and I know how much I’ve saved, especially at Target)... but I’m so tired of the stupid gift cards.

What a waste of time.

According to this, Bitcoin is going to burn us all.

I’m almost sure this is about seeing the balance right before withdrawing. It’s a trap.

BitRefill’s exchange rates are inconvenient sometimes. Personally I like the [Fold]( app, using the lightning network via BlueWallet.

Care to elaborate?

Why does Nexo try so hard? It’s like their strategy is to use all the strategies previously used by desperate businesses.

Wait until they set their own nodes.

Consider the possibility of a scam.

The lightning network is an amazing idea. BlueWallet and the Fold app are the reason I started using bitcoin.    
    
My prediction is: *Target* will be the first large store to accept bitcoin payments in their self-checkout lanes. I use the Target app to pay all the time. They ALREADY have the infrastructure in all their locations and there’s just ONE little step forward needed: adding that option to their app.

No decent *anything* would require your password.
@_date: 2019-12-31 05:09:32
Are you serious? That’s a scam.
@_date: 2019-12-03 06:10:49
BlueWallet. All the way.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:26:17
It’s about to happen. To give you an example: have you used the lightning network? I’ve been using it a lot this year. Payments are instant. It’s freaking fantastic. I recommend the Fold app and BlueWallet.   
    
My prediction: *Target* will be the first large store to accept bitcoin payments. I use the Target app to pay all the time (via a QR code). I refill my target wallet with gift cards from Fold. It takes seconds. *Walmart* also has a similar app.    
    
There’s just one little step needed: adding the option to refill the app wallet with bitcoin. These stores ALREADY have the necessary infrastructure in all their locations to accept payments via instantly generated QR codes. They’ve been preparing for this: **people will pay with their phones in a way that is totally independent** from Apple, Google, Visa, Master card, or any other company.

“Stabilized”, really?
