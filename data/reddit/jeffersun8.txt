 You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day sir!

nobody can accurately answer this.  It's been the only discussion here for weeks, just go read through any thread here.  Objectivity is hard to come by
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:18:29
i believe in you guys!  we can make it to 6k!
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:39:43
i don't know if english is your first language, I'm just saying your sentences are mildly confusing and contradictory
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:00:17
that rug at 7k got pulled out real quick. Down we goooo
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:39:51
at the current rate, maybe in like an hour lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:21:45
stuck in kraken hell, but their market price is about $500 behind gdax, so i'm only mildly aggravated
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:04:21
could have said that $500 ago.  Panic buys.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:20
if you had BTC on coinbase during the aug 1 fork, you should have BCH coming to you, and it'll probably be worth more than nothing
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:16:32
reasonable correction for that crazy spike.  might have settled by now
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:38
but if i sell, and then buy lower, i have more, so...
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:42:21
always chance. lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:41:13
battle of the bastards
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:06:02
he's not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:42:44
so did everybody get those $7500 sells out of their system?  Can we move on now?  
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:35:44
it works in many ways.  i should have gone to sleep like 4 hours ago.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:06
the last significant resistance was at 6200.  now 5600 and dropping like a rock, we're hitting 5k easy.  We'll have to wait and see what happens after the correction tomorrow.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:50:23
But what if he's emotionally invested in his emotional investment?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:41
korea.  and it's BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:40:32
"idiots" have been buying in for months now, and those "idiots" likely have no idea what the fork even was.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:24
"but it is $1,000 higher than tomorrow" implies it drops another $1000 tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:39:08
look again
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:07:56
it's as simple as making a "limit" order and not a "market" order.  All those orders on the book are "limit" orders, and are "takers" in that they fill orders once that price is met.  If you initiate a "market" order, it will get filled at the closest price it can find that's on the book, in which case you're the "maker" of that order, and pay .25%.  Most exchanges have a lower taker fee, gdax is 0%.  Investopedia has some comprehensive articles 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:20:19
doing anything on kraken is always hell, any time
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:44:13
5500 lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:24:45
.25% is the Taker fee, I assume he's on gdax.  The Maker fee is 0.  This guy had no idea what he's doing, as he's clearly laid out.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:08:19
price goes up. price goes down.  repeat.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:11:52
If you're gonna buy and hold, it's not a game, it's an investment, and you hold, on the trezor you already bought.  There's gonna be ecstasy and panic, that's the only guarantee right now.   
if i had a 1000 bitcoin, i would never keep it on an exchange, but then I probably wouldn't be playing these games either.  If you have enough faith that your exchange is not going to get hacked, and you're playing with &lt;1 btc in panic mode, you can automate buys and sells, and "stop loss".   With how panicked your first comment was tho, i'm just gonna say be careful.  Read up.        
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:32:59
i mean, every comment in this thread, i don't see it.  you can't afford to lose your $4k investment, but you bought in on a crazy bull run and then panic sold expecting a total collapse?  At least set some stop-losses; I'm assuming your money is still on an exchange?  And what happens if it doesn't go back under $3k?  Buy again on the next spike?  Either you're gonna hold, or you're gonna make it a game, in which case you better hedge your bets.

Why in the world would you feel the need to prove anything here?  You weren't even really challenged in any significant way, and you cough up proof.  Wtf
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:56:22
i don't know if this game's for you, man.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:39:45
