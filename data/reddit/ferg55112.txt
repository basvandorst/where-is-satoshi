You should go buy yourself some Bitcoin Cash, shut the fuck up, and get off this subreddit BOYIIIIEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:10
I wasn’t referring to this sub actually making it move like that. It was BTC world in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:50:04
Flag for begging. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:45:39
No they are not gone. Do NOT listen to anyone that says so. I did this exact same thing a month ago. Their support team will manually need to configure the BCH address you sent it to, to a BTC address. Then you will Have your BTC back. They will not shapeshift the currency because it’s easier for them to manually reconfigure the address type than the currency itself.

I feel like this subreddit now makes me feel like I am a Magic 8 Ball. So to answer your question, “It is decidedly so.”
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:38:42
It’s over for you. No more dips. Should not have sodl.

And on a side note, wouldn’t massive blocks be better for BTC? I feel like 1MB is not enough given the amount of users now. Doesn’t SegWit AND LN solve this problem? If so, why isn’t it being implemented? Is it still in infancy?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:01:32
I agreed with you. I accidentally entered the BCH subreddit and thought it was weird that everyone was talking shit about BTC. Then I realized where I was. I slowly tip toed out but first read an article on the differences. That’s what got me to asking this question.  But it gave some logical reason as to which one could be better than the other. As I said, im all in for BTC but wouldn’t mind hedging it with some BCH as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:25:44
It’s how people are able to hack another’s wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:56
Ah yes. Ok ���� but it still lends itself to the fact that it’s a straightforward answer to a pretty basic question. Just like anything that goes up and down It means you are an idiot for asking that question in price. You go to Walmart and see something is on sale. You want to buy it. But the next day the same thing is more expensive. Same concept. So why is this confusing to you? Just because you are new to bitcoin doesn’t mean that you are new to the concept of inflating or deflating prices.

lol !!!!!! Old news yo!!!!!

Welcome To Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:54
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:59:36
Who cares? It’s bitcoin related. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:56:31
I bought some, (and not enough) when it was at $3700. Just sitting back now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:53:30
Yes i’ve been completely bored today and yesterday
And before you trolls start talking shit, I do work 40 hours a week for a financial institution, I am married, and I have three kids. So I’m plenty busy, just bored with Bitcoin today and yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:59:40
Dunno. Try deleting the CC and setting back up. Or try another card. Or just use the bank ACH. I like the bank ACH because it takes a week roughly to post so I couldn’t sell even if I wanted to it the price is crashing. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:59:43
Report for begging. And an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:06:30
Rule one - never show your hand. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:45:11
Well, first of all, that’s an idiotic question. You just said you purchased it when you had $1200 worth of BTC so why would you worry the next day that you can’t afford it if BTC dropped to $900!? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:26
Welcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:55
That’s fine with me. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:54:01
Check out the Freewallet app. You can swap a ton of currencies there. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:04:42
I never said they would sell forever. I know there is a finite amount. But if they have a lot of coins bought up, then they can maybe keep this going for a few weeks or longer. Future contacts are short term so they wouldn’t need to stifle the price fo that long. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:41
Was this last night?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:08:15
Can you explain this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:08:56
If you have been a redditor for 2 days, then I will eat my left shoe if you carry 230 BTC. Let’s see your API and private key with a screen shot for dessert.

Lol. Crashing. Lol.

Transfer it to another exchange that will allow it.

50 BTC my ass.

I’m just talking about the direct bank link. It takes longer but at least you have it set up. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:08:03
I don’t have a source on the futures volume. Like I said, just a theory. I’m bored at work 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:29
No no. HODL ON
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:05
Don’t get scared. Just HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:20:07
Maybe as BCC is lower at this moment, start buying into that, to hedge against your current BTC holding. It seems as though these are reciprocal in gains and losses. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:39
Oh I see what you are looking for. Yeah, sorry I don’t know about that one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:43:13
You beat me to it. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:32:04
Yes. When I am looking for brief info. Then yes I will take the answer from a stranger. Obviously if it was more important then I would go to the source. But I was only looking for a brief answer. I’m out. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:01:21
? You’re an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:22:49
You should use bitcoinity.org 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:34:33
Serious question / serious answer please: I watch this on bitcoinity.org as well. But can someone please help explain it to me and anyone else that wants to know? I have done some research behind this, but it still is complex and confusing to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:30:51
Dude that is seriously worth 1.5 pennies. Tomorrow pick up 2 pennies walking down the street and then you can write this off. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:20:39
Does Coinbase use Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:16:07
My wife wants me to sell a little for Xmas presents this year. I got into this YUGE argument over it. She will never understand. HODL yo!
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:03:51
Yep. And it looks like the Bitfinex is crashed. Hasn’t refreshed on this site in 15 minutes 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:19:53
I didn’t know there was one. I came here for a brief answer, not to be redirected somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:43:02
Oh never mind. It appears to be up again. Sorry all. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:22:19
If you download Coinbase you can set price alerts for BTC LTC and ETH
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:23:14
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:21:03
I don’t think I will sell anything until it’s enough to take out HALF and pay off my debts. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:10:20
Lol. Close. But no. Give it a few more minutes 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:28:08
Dude it hit $8000 about 2.5 hours ago.

Thanks for he brief answer! This is why I come here!
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:14:50
Yes. It’s depressing.

No where in here do I beg. I said for people to IM me to talk more about my surgery. It’s a grey area if anything.
