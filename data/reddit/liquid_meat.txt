somethiing tells me that there are a lot of people in debt who don't think it'd be so bad to not be in debt... 


that's exactly what it means. 
sure both suck. but 1 sucks 10x less.

lmao. did I say it matters? 
no. I don't think I did. its still not the same situation... one situation is literally 10x worse. it may not be a big deal due to the overall scale of both problems. but that doesn't change reality.

you mean the risk of losing the hundred grand?
since when did a stack of money become everything to people?

a bit coin wallet. like any wallet. is only as secure as the place the owner keeps it.

... so what? 
whats your point? 
do you know how many people write down pin numbers and passwords on sticky notes? 
like I said its only as secure as the place its being stored. 
and that includes your fancy hardware wallets. because at some point in the chain... a human is involved. and they're notoriously not secure.
