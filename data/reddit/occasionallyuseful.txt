Usually these sites are giving out 1-10 microBitcoins per address entry. At a value of $200 per bitcoin, that would be 50-500 page views per $.01 paid out. With decent advertising, this could actually be slightly profitable. But I'm guessing that these sites are more likely to be using the solved captcha's for bots.

I think he's trying to target more the people who are treating it more as a daytrading stock, rather then people who are offloading coins from mining/sales. As in the people who see the price dropping so get scared and offload their assets, rather than selling at whatever the current market price is on a daily/weekly basis to transfer bitcoins to USD.

Not that I'm a conspiracy theorist, but if you hosted this experiment, and found a huge security flaw that would make you a lot of money, would you tell everyone? Or tell everyone the coast is clear and rake in the dough?

This is actually an amazingly good response, and I love that from a person even when it is opposite my views. I agree with physalix though about point 9, except in a slightly different way. Businesses converting immediately to USD doesn't hurt the bitcoin economy, because they are more of the end of the chain for bitcoin, just like Google probably converts currency from local markets immediately to USD. And I disagree with his argument about Bitpay as well, because from what I've heard it's extremely simple to set up, and I would be able deposit funds with a 1% fee. 1% is way better than the other options for payment, so it would still be the best option.
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:36:32
Credit Unions are better in practically every way anyway. I would love to see them embrace bitcoin and gain another edge on the big banks regardless.
Edit: By better I mean in keeping money local, speculating less, employing more people at better wages/hours, not being investor driven, etc.

If he would promise to give that btc back as credits to people who donates accounts after it's set up, I'm sure we could get a gang together to donate the $10000

I think the fact that it can be anonymous would really help, like if I helped an old woman with her groceries, I would refuse any money she would offer me. But if she was able to give me money anonymously, with no way to give it back, I would have to accept it.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:09:22
Especially because I hope in the future, sites have a Bitcoin price not based on local currency, because it costs less to accept bitcoin, so the price in Bitcoin should actually be slightly lower

I have a question, why do you sell bitcoins on ebay vs. locally? I'm just wondering, because I live in a small town (less than 5000, and it's the biggest town around), and there are still 2 offers on craigslist to buy bitcoins with cash. Because between ebay and Paypal you must lose ~12% of the sale. Honestly just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:27:24
Well as the subreddit gets more popular this will be helped too, because currently you only need ~20 upvotes in the first hour to be frontpage of where when it's more popular it will take hundreds and be easier to track illegitimate upvotes.
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:01:25
It would be an open format. Playable on any device you own. The only difference would be that it is a singular copy. It has a number attached to it that says it is that specific sale that you own. You could even play it offline and transfer it to someone else offline, just like bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:37:22
My question is how do they figure out how much you have in the first place? I guess it would be tracked if you bought it through Mt. Gox, but there are a lot of anonymous ways to get coins.
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:01:18
I'd probably steer clear of Cypruscoin.
A crypto currency entirely controlled by the government is a pretty scary scenario.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:41:59
If he had a large sum of money, then definitely yes, but less than a bitcoin? Security on the site should be good enough to feel safe storing less than $1000 (not that it's advisable to store any money on the internet, but as optimator999 said, it's a trading platform where you need some money to make transactions)

@_date: 2013-04-28 23:21:45
I can definitely understand that, I wish there were sellers like you in my area though, I hate buying off ebay or bitinstant because of the markup. I'd rater just pay market price with cash from a local dealer. There are buyers around me, but no sellers.

I can do it for 500
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:35:25
I've bought about .5 bitcoins there over the last few months (in amounts from .01 to .1 per sale, because surprisingly that was the best price point) whenever I saw some that were a good price. I've always had good luck, but I only bought from sellers that had a decent amount of good feedback from selling bitcoins. I'm definitely not advocating buying on there, because there is little protection for either person, but I have used it ~10 times and the transaction has gone smoothly every time.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:51:45
Many listings on craigslist are accepting bitcoins now, but if you want something safer there's a list of businesses that accept bitcoins (real world and online) somewhere, let me see if I can track down the site.
Edit: 
Not the site I was thinking of, but has a decent list
Edit 2: I think the list I was thinking of was actually the one that you mentioned already reading in your post, oh well

But the first few BTC is like collecting stamps or something, there are lots of sites that give away microBitcoins (as in millionths) that are getting plenty of traffic. There are a lot of people who would go out of their way for something new and exciting like this.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:35:19
It's reasonable in the sense that it's a small amount of money, but one of the big draws for Bitcoins is that it's basically free for transactions, like if I was to hand you 5 bucks cash, there's no fee, nothing, I just give you the money.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:13:06
I wonder why it takes so long though, I have a quick connection (around 30 megs) and it took my around 8 hours to download it. I could have downloaded a huge amount in utorrent in that time.
Edit: I just checked, and the blockchain is currently right around 8 gigs, which if it was utilizing my full 30 megs (3.75 MB/s) then it would take about 40 mins.
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:52:01
Yea, it's pretty ridiculous. I almost got one of those unlimited packages for about $20 a month thinking it was worth it just in case, when now after about a year of use I've spent ~$15 with them. That's a big savings. Especially when with other providers, when I buy the $20 unlimited package, really all I'm doing is subsidizing the people who abuse the unlimited (not that they don't have a right too, just that I'd rather pay for what I actually use).
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:26:55
I'd really love a way to see how many bitcoins were out of circulation. Since bitcoins used to be worth a lot less there are probably tons of wallets with a few BTC people forgot about or deleted. I bet it's at the very least a few thousand BTC by now.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:12:21
But the point is it will make people more likely to purchase in the digital format. There will always be pirates, there's no way to stop that. But making it more easily available and actually worth something could bring piracy to a much lower amount.

An average user yes, but a skilled computer person could definitely find it. Just for example, if you change the name of a .exe to .doc, and then double click it, it will open with Office, and then run as an exe, because Windows will still inspect its header, which still says it's an exe, and then run it. So most types of files will have a very distinguishable header that they could make a script to search for.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:07:06
This brings up another point. Cook County has higher taxes than the rest of the state, so does the person selling have to keep track of state taxes, and then individually higher taxes within the state?

Haha, I came here to say exactly this. I bet there will be a glut of GPU's, but it will likely be a glut of very used cards. I really hope it doesn't hurt ATI's reputation in the long run if this happens. (they shouldn't suffer just because their cards are better at mining bitcoins :p)

Do you have any sources on that? Like did he post it in the forums or something? I'd just like to see what his reasons are for not believing in it. And even then, he could except Bitpay at 1% fee and that would still be much better than the current options.
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:43:47
But would it be reasonable? Are we talking a possible 50-200% jump? Or on the magnitudes of thousands of percent?
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:50:10
I've always wondered though, as we get faster and faster computers doing the transactions, will this time become negligible? Or is there something besides that limiting the speed of transactions?

This is very close to what I was imagining. I really hope something like this gets implemented in the near future.

Very well thought reply. I've wondered myself if one of the large money entities will take on the process of being the middleman between merchants and consumers. Like I think in the future, a large portion of merchants will only except bitcoins from a secured source, as in you deposit funds to Paypal, once they've 6 conformations you can spend them at a merchant. As soon as you've spent the coin Paypal would remove them from your account, even before they're confirmed, preventing double spends and making it 100% safe for the merchant. Unfortunately this would mean a fee between the user and the merchant.

I had never done a Western Union transfer in my life, until a few weeks ago when I got my first bitcoins through bitinstant. I had the coins within a few minutes of finishing the paperwork, so it was a really easy transaction. But the added fees from ZipZap made it a little annoying. If that fee could be cut out, and moneygram took the initiative to be the only middleman it would be amazing for them and for anyone wanting to get instant USD to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:06:41
What I meant wasn't that we don't pay fees now, just that currently you can make bitcoin transactions for basically free, but in the future this might not be the case at most major retailers.

The fact that a lot of people did what you did is the reason the bots DDOS MT Gox. I've definitely made some of the same mistakes in the stock market so I know how it feels. The DDOS'ers hope for people to panic sell as the price drops, and they've definitely accomplished that several times. My suggestion is just to use the bitcoin as currency, hold some, spend some, and over time the value will rise, and it will set it's own price point. The day trading and DDOSing have been wreaking havoc on the Bitcoin and it is sad to see.

Bitcoin is really perfect for any "free" software developer, be it completely free or "free" with paid upgrades, because in most cases, the software has already been written, and very little cost is added per user, so really any amount is useful to them. This prevents the huge swings in the value of Bitcoins from really effecting what they receive, because any donation is more than 0, and Bitcoins would make a lot more people willing to donate.

There is also the issue of exchange rate. Bitpay makes it so you never have to worry about this, but if you just accept bitcoin, and hold it until you exchange it (if you needed it in USD) then the price of bitcoins could tank right after they purchase the item causing you to lose money. It really depends if you're in for the long haul with the bitcoins, or are going to quickly change them to local currency.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:48:25
The fact that people use it as currency is what gives it value. If tomorrow everyone decided to use litecoins instead of bitcoins, the price of bitcoins would go to 0, because bitcoins only have a worth when being used as currency.

I'm currently trying out their link shortener on one of my websites, but I've only been doing it for a day or so. Once I have some real data I'll let you know how the payout is. I'm also going to try serving their ads on that website and see how that goes vs other providers. Ease of use for the link shortener was awesome, so if it pays well then I'll definitely recommend it.
