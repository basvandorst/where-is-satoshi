You're welcome!
I guess Bitcoin​ Core is somewhat "standard" wallet.
There are wallets that allow you to reverse transactions and send with commission AFAIK, but bt-core is not among them.
That zapwallettx works only with bt-core.
Im kinda new to this wallets-transactions theme so don't trust me to much :)

Same problem here.
I use Bitcoin Core latest version. My transaction is still unconfirmed. This  says I should contact Bitcoin Core support. But there isn't such option on their website!
Wat do? How do I get my money back?

The other option - 
But only if you are lucky enough - this only works for 100 users per hour.
