Still way too much. Go for the b wallet.

Yep. Keeps you on your toes. I always like to have as much control as possible. Glad I was able to provide some insight to your situation. Hope it helped :)

And all you guys seem very scared/nervous about them creating blockchains that you feel the need to make posts berating them every 20 minutes.

bitcoin isn't for you then. Wait until the killer app comes out and then simpletons like you can use it again.

I ditched the Trezor I bought when they came out for the reasons you are mentioning. Doing my own cold storage wallets/paper wallets just makes me feel so much better.

bip38 will always be better.

Done: 
Note: this is not an altcoin/cryptocurrency itself.

Who cares?

They had control of a market. That will soon be long gone though.

"principles" = poor money management abilities and average credit at best

I would assume panic. Funds move out of bitcoin to observe the market. Could cause a crash. Could see a lot of funds flowing into the next most relevant crypto (ltc at the moment).

It's pointless.

By not being a noob.

Ledger Blue will destroy the competition. Hold out for this if you're looking for a hardware wallet.

Trezor is garbage.

Not even close. We are way above and beyond that. We were the ones running our own e-mail clients using our own domain names at that point. Probably even hosting for others.
I actually enjoy the time I spend dedicating to cold storage and I do feel much more in control. Plus, after you do it enough, it becomes much easier and you feel really comfortable and confident. 
I'll add that I found the company behind Trezor to be rather unprofessional (example:  which contributed to my ditching of it completely, rather than just using it with smaller amounts for fun/whatever. Still, out of all my methods of storage, when I had some on the Trezor, I was always concerned about those coins the most. Whether or not that's rational or not, I do not care. Keep in mind that if you don't compile the software yourself, you definitely risk that man in the middle attack.
