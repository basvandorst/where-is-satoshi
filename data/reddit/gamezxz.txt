I'm stupid to think that the bitaddress is safe.

My friend have good in English rewrite my post.
My 387 Bitcoins got hacked and stolen! (1EENuimoixhyn6k67UgeYo2mFFhRfEYots)
Address:1EENuimoixhyn6k67UgeYo2mFFhRfEYots Message: I'm not fake, Renben9 Signature:H3RQ2A5sYDLI6x1qJU0UDBDXZQ8UugAmeEBNs1S9Tq3xX5COtftktVABaFPUWfkjBPqSAc9J5xWqNJAwvAr+0D0=
I would like to share my sad story so that no one will repeat the same mistake as me ever again. This thief-hacker transaction, which I will remember forever, just taught me last night to not trust any service provider anymore.
I created a private key from Bitaddress.org on 2017-08-08 and imported my private key into Blockchain Wallet (Blockchain.info) which provided the SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure.
But last night around 3 am GMT+7, my wallet got stolen. The thief transferred out everything with no access through Blockchain.info wallet at all. So it seems like the thief some how hacked and accessed to my private key which allows him to make a transaction manually with the third-party broadcasting tool.
These past few months, I never aware of this risk since many tutorials suggest me how to make a paper wallet via Bitaddress.org and just simply link it with Blockchain.info wallet.
I realize it’s my fault to not create and keep my Bitcoin in a real cold storage. I would like to share this story to be a lesson for our Cryptocurrency community so everyone can be aware and start taking the security issue more serious.
Last but not least, I would like to launch ‘CryptoSafe project’ that aims to educate Cryptocurrency security literacy to newbie like me. If you would like to support me, my Bitcoin wallet address is now open for receiving donation ☺️

Thank you. For this post. I just want to warning other people. 
I hope that others will not fall victim like me.

This is 2/3 of my money :(
After this, I still have enough money left for my distribution.
I will continue to live. I'm a very negligent programmer. I've bought a hardware wallet and now I'm thinking of something that Edward Snowden is not comfortable with and vulnerable.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:41:50
This is my missing 2/3 amount.
Now I have bought a Ledger nano S. Do you think this is the best way to keep Bitcoin and it will not disappear anymore?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:20:42
I got it.
I never knew that malware was complicated and Sneaky by the user does not know anything.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:37:56
Yes It's real. And I try to tell you SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure.
Why I don't get any access log.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:56:17




Thank you.
It reminds me of Edward Snowden Do not trust computer when it connect internet.
My $ 1.7 million dollar memoir must be memorable, and I will tell everyone I love. About this lesson.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:50:37
Me... I just think it secure 
Fuck Fuck Fuck...
Now I buy Ledger Nano S to keep bitcoin
Can we trust ? If I don't code by my self.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:30:03




I'm strong, I realized my mistake and I did not cry. And I'm good at making money, but I'm not stupid enough to keep it.
And now I bought it. Hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:09:07
I feel my posts have been deleted.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:55:23
Explain me, I want to know
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:24:51


Everyone does not think Bitaddress.org The only one who made that blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:43:36






Thank you for this explanation.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:59:25


I try to find a reason. Why is money gone?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:10:11


This address belongs to reddit.comtoday is 10/30/17.
Now I thought I'd never get it back again. But at least I would like to know that after this financial route, how to use money laundering. Will there be some way to get it back?
After this, I still have enough money left for my distribution.
I will continue to live. I'm a very negligent programmer. I've bought a hardware wallet and now I'm thinking of something that Edward Snowden is not comfortable with and vulnerable.

(1) What is happening is real. Fools like me
(2) I added a transfer because I did not know that already hacked.
(3) My English friend wrote this message to me, ignoring the Crypto Safe Project, and I bought the hardware wallet.
(4) I'm trying to find out why I got hacked. And I'm trying to find a way to save the rest.
(5) I'm still a Bitcoin investor. Although 2 million dollars are gone, I bought it for only 200,000 and I do not want to make Bitcoin look bad. I do not want it to happen to anyone else.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:13:03


I'm really lazy And now I'm thinking of keeping it rather than finding it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:39:31


I want to say that I am Thai, many people think this is a lie. For me, I have to admit that the money is gone. I use google transate to communicate with you. My language ability is terrible Do you see the problem? Why the money is gone Because i read less I agree that I think wrong. What makes it safe? And to put money in. Blockchain.info, which is a hot wallet. If this is the case for everyone else, I want to make it. I think that making 387 bitcoin for my fool is not possible. But it is already. I'm a programmer who bought this bitcoin 3-4 years ago, and it's not expensive. At that time, I could spend only 200,000, which is not very difficult to buy.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:19:56
Why I thank blockchain don’t hack because no access with email , sms and who know 2nd password? 
Or blockchain hack me?
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:45:17
Thief try to tell everybody fake to fool people
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:04:09
Do you think blockchain.info ? not bitaddress.org ?
Same me in first time I think Blockchain hack me.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:18:07


Do you think the solution is a hardware wallet or is there another way? I do not know what to trust.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:02:55
Do you mean I'm fake or Bitaddress.org fake ?
This is real ok I dont want donate I will delete it. I just Warning for other.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:35:05
Still, people do not believe that I'm really stupid.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:50:24




I'm stupid, do not rush to buy hardware wallet before being hacked.
