Right, but it doesnt really matter if its legal or not because its not something that can be stopped.

Well your right I don't think the blockchain has the power to stop corruption but I think the point is that it can make it easier to see when corruption is taking place.

In those situations sure. There are others where I imagine it could be more useful. Like donations to a charity, you would be able to see at least how much was coming in.

The difference is that the "books" are not exactly public. On a blockchain they would be.

Even if bitcoin itself crashed and failed, there would be nowhere to "move on" to except to start another bitcoin or perhaps go to an altcoin.

By where we need to be I didnt mean bitcoin. I was more talking about the seperation of money and politics.

What is the best way to put some bitcoin in cold storage as 12 words? 
Can I just send to an electrum wallet on an airgapped computer, write down the words and delete the wallet? One thing I was dissapointed about was that I couldnt recover my twelve words from electrum with mycelium. So I would have to use electrum again to take the bitcoins out.

Not sure what your proposing but Im interested. I started learning programming about a month ago now so I could hopefully some day get involved in the emerging field revolving around bitcoin. Working through the automate the boring stuff with python book right now and loving it so far.

I was actually thinking about this today as well. I think that something like this would have to be done very quickly because doing it would be like a call to war. People all over would hear about this and we would have people from all over the world setting up their own rigs to defend bitcoin. I assume the value would go up massively as well. But thats just what I think.

If it was being attacked by a big government, and everyone knew it was them, that would probably verify bitcoins importance to the rest of the world. Who would defend it? Probably people like me who are just casual bitcoiners, proponents of net neutrality, enemies of whichever government, etc.

As a middle class white guy from NY, the fact that you are getting down voted is quite disturbing to me. I mean, we have a guy talking about his own personal experience, saying that he doesnt like Trumps attitude towards him and his people. What about that makes you downvote?
