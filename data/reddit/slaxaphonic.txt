This is literally idiotic nonsense. The reason the ENTIRE market corrected was due to it being hyper-inflated and overbought. Bring 2 weeks of Asian regulatory news, and the collapse of bitconnect which triggered a 2B sell off... there’s you’re reason.
Why is tomorrow important? Because little old gdax opens a BTC/BCH pair? Like 90% of users didn’t already dump BCH to fiat? Why wouldn’t they just convert BTC to BCH tomorrow then to create a run on BCH? Why jeopardize the psychological fragility of the market? Most of us who’ve been around long enough held both our coins at the fork. 2x the bags for free. 
Grow up.

Take some crypto profits and hedge gold and silver while they’re cheap. Flip gold and silver when stock market and real estate correct, then buy real estate cheap. Keep a diversified portfolio. Crypto is incredible and worth hodling, but the economy wasn’t built in a decade, it won’t die that fast either. Traditional assets still are a safe place.

1. Bitmain theory doesn’t hold weight. Again, why tamper with psychological state of newer buyers and spectators thinking about entering the market. Let’s scare off new customers? Great business plan. 
2. I hodl both BTC and BCH. For years. I stash and trade. I take profits. So I’m not a BCH troll.
3. We used to have a great unified libertarian community until a private interest group hijacked BTC scaling with LN and SegWit. I still own BTC as a “store of value” but I don’t trust it. I certainly can’t use it for anything practical, and FUD trolls like you have ruined the culture.
4. Google digital currency group, Blockstream, AXA, bilderberg group... follow the money to LN devs support and tell me what decentralization really means.
5. I’ll reiterate that I own BOTH, and many other alts. I’ve been at this awhile. Diversify or get burned. This is economics, what goes up way too fast is overbought... what’s overbought will sell... what sells will go down. It’s not a crash, it’s a correction. Stop hypothesizing. The entire thing is overbought and could pop if these corrections don’t keep the market in check.
Finally, it’s maybe... not may be.

Diversify half into real estate with leverage, fiat, cryptos, metals, and traditional stocks/bonds, trade btc with 25%, and lock 25% into cold storage for 10 to 20 years.

That’s a lot of tinfoil even for me. I’m absolutely anti tether and believe they manipulated the market, but I believe they’ve covered their tracks after getting mega rich during the bull run. I’m sure they’ve created a balance sheet that would likely cover their liabilities “on paper.” That said, if the tether bubble did pop, the entire crypto market won’t be in winter, it’ll be in the dark ages.

Currency is psychological to begin with. As demand rises for its use case as a mode of exchange for goods/services, bitcoin’s infinite divisibility combined with its scarcity results in an increase of the purchase power it enables. You have to stop thinking about it in quantifying with dollars. Think of it as replacing dollars. That divisibility just means less of the unit is needed to purchase goods/services as more people recognize its usefulness.

This is a nonsensical post, no offense. The fork brought massive attention to the market place in the media. It created a ton of price action and pumping of price action both ways. It also spawned multiple ideas related to development and scale. No one lost their btc either unless they sold, and politically speaking people voted with their positions. Forking makes bitcoin, and cryptocurrency better fundamentally. It’s the entire concept of decentralization being upheld. I for one think the idea of “one coin to rule them all” goes against the traits of a healthy market. The bigger problem is that the new wave of bitcoiners have forgotten how many people and institutions want to see bitcoin and crypto die. They are far bigger foes. The more ideas and support in crypto, the better.

This doesn’t make sense. If the value of the dollar has decreased due to hyperinflation then it’s buying power in relativity reduces. The price of all items increases, maybe not to $1000 for coffee but it makes the point. I was just playing devils advocate. At that rate I guess btc could be worth even more if usd goes into hyperinflation in the future.

Kind of both ways... stop loss underneath at a target that you think you should check profit at, and another stop loss above to trigger a buy if the rally continues. If you don’t know the tools for trading it’s probably best to hold.

Everyone in this space expects moonboots to infinity or complete disaster to worthlessness. It’s almost annoying that the volatility is actually supported by that culture and mentality at this point. Chill out and know that 1% gain a day for a year would be uncanny growth in any asset class. These swings are ridiculous, speculative, and indicative of the immaturity in the space to begin with. So damn early in crypto. 
Disclaimer: I own btc, bch, eth, and neo long and have been in crypto for several years. I trade some % of my position regularly. I hope and expect to be trolled with lies about me yet again for my opinions. Lol

The whale theory is played out. Exchanges hold the most in their wallets for the most part. New and sidelined money has to be coaxed into returning. There isn’t simply an accumulation taking place by whales, though that is happening too.

Flat isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The market is trying to prove a true bottom. I think there’s another dip still coming imho.
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:48:44
I think there are a few things at play. Exchanges want to wash trade majority futures bids. It’s an easy way to make a return when trade volumes are low. Another huge factor is the algorithmically programmed bots trading on exchanges. Many are set to execute trades based upon automated responses to formulaic calculations that react to moving averages, volumes, RSI, etc. This is why you see such block style reactive charts that see volatile price action in very short time periods (Bart Simpson charts). 
They’re all reactively trading to sets of conditions immediately when they exist, but the trends remain unbroken until true buy/sells follow those active bot trades. Just my two cents.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:02:19
Truth, but it wouldn’t take much for bots to react to each other around the same triggers. One large move at a point of interest can create a fast action snowball effect.
Agreed about the colluding traders as well. Good point.
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:10:41
I’m not sure you’re really understanding why this happens... BTC is still a major trading pair with BCH on many exchanges that don’t have fiat and/or stable coin pairings. There are also those whom simply choose to trade into BTC as their base holding. When the market shows positive metrics and buy signals, BCH (along with many alts) sees positions re-allocated from BTC holdings as well as fiat and stable coins. Some price action moves from BTC to BCH. BTC also moves into many other alts at the same time. This slows the BTC growth % in comparison. Likewise, when the market shifts to the downside, traders move out of alts (BCH included), to BTC with profits which slows its decline in comparison to those alts.
Long story short. BTC is a major trading pair with alts including BCH. This creates the price action you speak of.
