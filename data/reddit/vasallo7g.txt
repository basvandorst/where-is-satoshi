This is also the reason "THEY" will sooner or later, or maybe they are already trying, to destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-26 19:00:35
bitcoin would lift off once the dollar crashes
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:49:23
this was actually before a dump, the guy is on their side
since BTC can not be destroy they can only do pumps and dumps to it, and that is exactly what they did when they took the price to 20k down to 5k
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:31:27
BTC is just a pump and dump loop, that average higher every 2 months  
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:31:37
nope. not many markets average higher every loop
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:16:39
This should be sticked
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:45:52
the day they start arresting guys who date fat girls, maybe I will believe the government is looking out for us
but so far it looks that they only care about themselves 
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:38:38
altcoins = gambling
bitcoin = investment 
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:41:14
the design does not change: poor countries (India, Mexico) ban bitcoin so they do not prosper, rich countries (Japan, Scandinavian) clear laws allowing crypto
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:54:33
no, this is the biggest scam in the history of mankind: [

Crypto solves the problem, mining is a non issue, why because there is already 17 million bitcoins on the market, less than 3 millions of bitcoin are left to mine, even if only one entity got them it would take them years to get them and by then the market is going to be versatile 
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:27:17
just the Chinese buying....I hear they are kind of a big group of people

@_date: 2018-10-05 17:04:30
Dollars (and all currencies) always worth less but not Bitcoin
The reason is the number of Bitcoin is fixed, but the number of dollars always keep growing 
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:40:34
There seems to be a world wide design. Bitcoin = prosperity.
In India is illegal in Japan is self regulated.
Coincidence? I don't think so!
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:09:57
Good so people take a look at how crazy the price has gone up in the previous years and jump in for the next spike
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:28:42
Bitcoin will destroy banks, imagine we skipping the banks and loaning bitcoins P2P, its like telling your wife you are just hanging with a hooker.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:55:30
One is limited and the other is unlimited
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:07:03
You don't understand the scam that is the USD if you think BTC has a final price

@_date: 2018-06-14 14:11:45
they are protecting investors of not needing a bank
@_date: 2016-12-31 04:47:21
this is going to be a great publicity for bitcoin, I bet a lot of Colombians are now figuring out how to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:20:04
How can a government justify banning crypto? 
its just an agreement of value between individuals.
What is next? are they going to arrest guys who date fat women?
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:32:37
This unawareness will make us rich
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:48:53
No, we are coming out of the biggest pump and dump in crypto history, it seems is now is the right time to get all in
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:39:23
His conviction is to keep other people from opening a crypto exchange
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:58:18
Thank you man, Im kind of worried of a sudden crash, and what you say sounds logical, what makes you think a BIG crash wont happen? because other people is talking about buying a gun and a piece of land with chickens...
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:30:48
Except for the stock market thing, I would do the same. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:26:00
usually guys that are afraid of losing his savings who will sell at a loss, I think the best option is to go long and forget about all this up and downs, in the long run bitcoin looks like a winner
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:28:19
I think there is honestly no better investment than BTC not even close.
On the other hand you should spend 10% to celebrate.
I think BTC will triple in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:22:35
it was a zero less than you (I am not from the US), but you did the right thing, BTC will be all right, but last week I hear about a dude that after doubling his money, he got hacked out of 85,000. 
He did not set up the 2 step verification on the wallet he used and someone send him an email so he went to a fishing site and entered his user and password.
I also just put some money in Ripple. My instinct tells me it will be another BTC. I dont trust most of the other coins.
You have to be used to many people calling you crazy for putting money in BTC but by next Christmas everyone will use it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:30:07
whoever is doing this has to 1. Have billions of dollars in purchasing power and willing to lose them 2. Wants to end bitcoin 
there is only one organization who fits that criteria, and I am afraid to name it (not JP Morgan)
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:54:45
the good thing is that in the long run, unlike gold, crypto can only be brought down after BUYING (in order to then sell them at a loss and bring the value down)

You think all of a sudden at the same time, thousands of investors decided to sell below market value? Nope, that was the plan of the big guy, but Bitcoin people never panic, we known in the long run we will make it
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:49:49
not OP in fact OP is wrong, whoever tried to bring down bitcoin lost billions of dollars, and it is not the first time they have done it, the spike at the end its just a logical result of people waiting to buy when the big seller gets out, who else lose? guys that got scared and sold at loss
@_date: 2018-11-03 20:04:11
I was thinking that the reason they do not outright ban Bitcoin is because it would create a black market and that would also raise to question why only a small group is allowed to print legal money

I already took a loan 2 months ago, trying to get another
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:02:38
I am all in Ripple, been doing better than BTC for the last month...until yesterday.
Keep Ripple all this month, but getting in BTC at least in some percentage in the next dip.

Anyone who is helping crypto succeed has to understand that at the end of the day this is a war for the control of the money supply

@_date: 2016-07-26 13:00:44
He is right BTC is a currency, just like the dollar. Only gold and silver are money.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:02:14
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:27:42
Hardest money? 
Bitcoin is the first time in human history since gold coins ( let's be honest, gold coins must have lasted 2 weeks before someone was tampering with them) that real money exist.
@_date: 2016-07-14 02:29:48


They definitely knew about this ([The Economist cover of September 1998]( I dont know if in purpose or just something that was going to happen eventually due to they leaving the gold standard and naturally falling in the temptation of overprinting currency.


 
I dont see how people would trust a new currency when the dollar goes kaput


that is my question Bitcoin or another currency that is hard to manipulate would not mean an era of prosperity?
Last Question: Would you sell a house that is near your job and near downtown (althought not in a very good neighborhood) and exchange the sale money for gold/silver/bitcoin? or a piece of land would also be a good asset to keep? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:05:40
People need money for transactions and BTC is the best there is
People will always use money
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:48:08
because the sorry ass dude who bought a pizza for 10k BTC, now that pizza is worth more than 40,000,000 USD
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:24:32
Everyone of us that has bitcoin and does not use it as currency, is betting on this
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:21:40
Shit, this feels like in the movies when the dragon turns his head to look at the little guy who hit him....
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:02:58
Good, get me mine first, no point in buying in March at 20k
