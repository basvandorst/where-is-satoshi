gpg agent is on their alpha so I don't recommend using it for now.
For 2FA, you should use U2F which works fine. This is a 2FA which has nothing to do with password, U2F is a standard for authenticating yourself on a service through a hardware device.
Basically it will be a [yubikey]( with crypto currency features and open. So this is awesome.
A password manager where password are derived from your seed might be developped as a Nano S apps, I guess they will do that sooner or later.
In the future your PGP key can be derived from your seed as well, you can already play with it in alpha, but this is more for developer usage for now.
Here is supporters of U2F for now:

This would be a systemic risk, as all applications would need to update and would have no way to test on the real network before a specific date.
See it that way: Imagine that when Microsoft release a new OS, then everybody is obliged to migrate, even if some of their daily application does not support it yet.
As a Microsoft fan, I would never dare running an OS from Microsoft before the SP1.
The way we update things in IT, is by testing the new OS, then migrate a small number of enthusiastic users, check feedback from community, then finally migrate larger portions of the user base.
This diminish systemic risk.
So HF are less dangerous for applications. But Segwit would not.

if you don't care about the hassle, that you have bank accounts already setup in both country, then yes, use an exchange it is better and cheaper once set up. I hopefully will get a bank account soon so I will stop be bothered by bitcoin trades in person.
I have no recommendation on the exchanges. I use kraken in europe since I have a bank account, it always worked great. I heard they had some customer support problem in japan though. Bitflyer is the biggest one in Japan of the three.
And yes, no reason to use bitfinex, if you want to wire in US bank account.
However, for BTC =&gt; USD you might need another exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase will also ask you AML/KYC. I'm not sure Kraken support USD. (I might be wrong)
Expect the whole process to take 1 or 2 weeks. If there is no problem.

no, spam is low utility transactions, such utility being evaluated by the individual making the transaction.

I am well aware of code bloat, and everyone who has been a developer for long enough know the issues. But all software don't deal with the "burden" of decentralisation. In a consensus system widely used like bitcoin, if you want to make any changes you have to convinced people, you can't force any change. 
So the deal is about choosing whether you will fight with people who does not want their code broken just so you get "clean code" on your part.
Or making a thing that is not so clean, but at least does not break other people's work.
Now he is free to dev anything he wants as a hard fork to make clean code, the problem is just that you will never be able to make people agree with it, contrary with non consensus software.

Step 1: "Bank Workers tell their bosses: Stop Making Us Sell Shady Products"
Step 2: Bank stop selling shady products
Step 3: Bank worker get fired because no money
Step 4: Former bank workers complains to government.
Such bank workers get their paycheck thanks to those "shady product" and then claim that the immoral persons are the one above them, because they are only "executing order". 
Such a convenient way to get only the upside of immoral actions while keeping their own conscience clear of guilt. To my mind those workers are even worse than the one above them. 
If you know your product is bullshit, and you are still selling it, you are the one to blame for not getting out of here. So if you stay, at least admit that you accept ripping people off for your own good, and stop pretending you are just following orders when you feed on your victim as much as the one above you.

If she decides update the limit, she will not receive $500 but 300$. A simpler way would be to just ask the sender to send less money and accept the loss. Moreover updating the channel mean a transaction on chain, so it is just better to send the 500 on chain instead.


Adding fund to a payment channel is not possible. You need to close the channel and reopen it, whcih make one transaction. In such case, it is better to just send the 5000$ to Alice on chain rather than LN then Alice will be able to open a big channel with that directly if she needs to.
What you describe is not LN, but a payment hub. The reason why payment hub won't work is that it requires them to lock reserves. (which is not a problem for colored coin if the payment hub is the issuer)
Meanwhile, in LN, as a node your funds are not locked as you can it for making payments. I advise you to take a look at 
I think the UI will be more about using a debit card analogy where you can spend money from the debit only if the remote peer is online. As service hub will cost money for locked funds, it makes an incentive to be decentralized, people should prefer to open channel with their friends.

Block halving will provoke sudden drop in confirmation time. 
Big blockers will attempt a DDoS attack as a way to push a "urgency 2MB Bump fix". The alert key is used by undisclosed party to propagate a message "Update to Classic" to old node.
At the same time [Greece episode 2 unfold]( which will provoke a rush on Bitcoin, a rush of people ready to pay high fees to get their money out of banks. The DDoS attack actually help solving the situation as the spammer contribute to finance the lost subsidy, as well as push everybody to finance it.
2 week laters, difficulty adjustement kick in and things come back to normal. The supply of bitcoin being lower, uncertainty over the halving reduced, coupled with the fact that greece try to get money out of their bank will provoke Bitcoin rise to the moon.

What I don't like with using the defintion of the dictionary, is that it rely on "irrelevant or inapproriate" which presuppose some sort of authority who classifies what is irrelevant and what is not. 
Bitcoin should be censorship resistant, so if we keep this definition and say: "We must fight spam", this is a direct attack to bitcoin.
Low value transaction are just the low hanging fruit where dropping them just make the network keep operating. As a recent Andreas talk, the whole internet would have crashed in the 90, if someone looked at a lolcat video through it. Now we can support youtube.
Concerning the "artificial limit", it is still here because of the free market. This limit purpose has been technical from the start, and right now, the market just refuse to change it as the risk are not well known. If the market was favorable to removing it, Classic would have succeeded, and flooding attack (to not confuse our terminology) would have make bitcoin unbearable to the point where removing the limit is less painful than keeping status-quo. This limit is part of the market and is not enforced by a commitee. It will probably be removed when tech advances allows it, which is again something that can't be measured, and depends more on how people perceives the risks and benefits of removing it. 
Right now the market perceive the risk of removing/changing it outweight the benefit of introducing 1 cts utility transaction in the chain.

New coins won't be fungible with the old coins until everybody update, so not so sure it is really a SF, even if people who does not updated are not kicked out of the chain. The old node won't accept the new coin until they update, thus the two currencies will get different valuation.

The way it is actually developped is by abstracting the channel aspect completely for now. But I have doubt that this can be done completely without leaking underlying technical complexity. 
How can you easily, in a UX, explain to the user that he has 10 BTC, but can't send 1 BTC to his destination because peers of some payment channels are not connected ? Or because no channel has a 1BTC balance available.
On the other hand, showing your "balance" with each of payment channels opened with your contacts would easily explain such details.

You asked me for a definition of spam. I gave it one to you which does not rely on what any authority think and that is the same for everyone.
If your behavior is impacted by small change of fee, then you are spamming, and by such you should do it on another chain as long as Bitcoin can't support your case without hurting bitcoin core's properties. (And I'm sure it will support at one point)
When you ask me "how do you quantify security ?", I don't have an answer, but I would give you the same response as Hayek in his "The Pretence of Knowledge" speech that what is measureable is not  always the most important, and what is important not always measurable.
If you think that another chain is secure enough, and liquidity good enough so that it is worth saving 1 cts to your transaction, then by all mean you should go on another chain, as you can't force the Bitcoin network to take your transaction without appropriate fee.

we should probably discuss that around a beer, I'm still having a hard time following how such way of doing will not result in abstraction leak. For example, if Alice has multiple channels (with "receive limit" one of 5000 and the previous one of 500) she can receive 5500 BUT not in one payment. The maximum payment she can receive is 5000. I'm not sure how this details will be able to be hidden.
Abstracting the way you are suggesting will result in users totally confused about why they hit all sort of limits mysteriously. Which change everytimes.


It has also different result. Closing the existing channel and reopening with more fund and opening a new channel is different. Not only from the tech perspective but for the user as well.
With the "receive limit" of one payment channel at 2500 USD and one at  1500 USD, the maximum amount of money you can receive in one payment from a third party is not 4000 but 2500. Not having an UI that explain that with a useful analogy will result in confusions.
If you want 4000, you need to close and recreate the channel, not creating an "new one and hidding it". But if you do that, then that mean that for 10min you won't be able to receive nor send money at all, because the anchor transaction is not yet confirmed by bitcoin.
Also let's imagine the situation (Alice;Hub).
Initial state: (0,50) so the receive limit is 50. Now Bob wants to sends 100. So the Hub ask alice to send 50 to the hub to increase the receive limit.
New state: (0,100)
Bob pays: (100,0)
Now how much Alice really received ? She received 50 and not 100, because she paid out of her pocket 50 for increasing the limit, and received 100 back.
Creating a correct abstraction does not mean we can completely hide the underlying realities away.

@_date: 2016-04-14 15:13:47
I don't think there can be hubs like that, because the only way it could work was if you paid them for filling their side of the channel, which would make no sense: you would pay them just to receive your money later.
Hubs pre paying for free seems like it would make them out of fund very quickly.
I think more about an interface where you see your list of contact, and can decide to "open a payment channel" with one of those. So you would establish only payment channel with people you know, instead of randomly.

Every service not using segwit, can be updated to use segwit. So everybody is on the same foot.


Completely orthogonal to segwit


Orthogonal to segwit, Coinjoin transaction can use segwit as every service. (actually I think even found a way to merge a chain of unconf coinjoin's transactions into one transaction which is possible because of malleability fix, so it would make coinjoin cheaper... source needed, I remember vaguely about the details)


Yes they will. But they will not be more expensive post segwit. It is segwit transaction which become cheaper, not non segwit which become more expensive.


Yes, can decrease it as soft fork.


Thanks in advance.
Vague question. 
* Services which do not update will pay higher fee that those which do all things being equals.
* Services which do not update will pay the same fee as current one (no change), those who does will get lower fee. (because only new one get access to bigger space)
I would argue that current service will even pay a bit lower, because they will get more space than before in the core size as other services move their transactions scriptSig in witnesses.

Nice explanation, but the term IOU is misleading. This is not an IOU since the redemption does not depend on the trust of the other party.
Since it does not depend on trust, it should be considered plain bitcoin, except they are transacted offchain instead of onchain until the pending transaction is broadcasted.

Correct. Bitfinex is useful if you don't need to withdraw your USD in a bank account. (else you'll have the KYC stuff as all exchanges)


Bitflyer, Coincheck, Kraken, or in-person trading (LocalBitcoin). Exchanges demands from you lots of KYC/AML stuff, and making the wire transfer takes time. Other solution is that I am in Tokyo and willing to meet in person if you want to buy Bitcoin from me.

There is also another thing: If you mix 10 BTC, do not merge the resulting 100 UTXO together.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:51:12
It might be safe, it all depends on how you received the inputs that got mixed.
If say you received exactly 1 UTXO of 1 BTC, mix and get 10 UTXO of 0.1, then spend them all. This will show up, yes.
If you send 3 withdraws of 3 UTXO to an exchange, spaced this time, it will not show up easily.
If you get 1 UTXO of 1 BTC, mix them, get 5 UTXO of 0.1 BTC and mix them also, and then send 1.1 BTC then you should be alright.
Those are privacy tools, and it is up to the user to use them correctly. The UX can be helpful, but at the end of the day, there is no way to prevent foot shooting. Whichever the protocol.

I am a dick, but interestingly you are right :
    // Start enforcing CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, (BIP65) for block.nVersion=4
    // blocks, when 75% of the network has upgraded:
    if (block.nVersion &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; IsSuperMajority(4, pindex-&gt;pprev, chainparams.GetConsensus().nMajorityEnforceBlockUpgrade, chainparams.GetConsensus())) {
        flags |= SCRIPT_VERIFY_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY;
    }
with IsSuperMajoriy being
    static bool IsSuperMajority(int minVersion, const CBlockIndex* pstart, unsigned nRequired, const Consensus::Params&amp; consensusParams)
    {
    unsigned int nFound = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; consensusParams.nMajorityWindow &amp;&amp; nFound &lt; nRequired &amp;&amp; pstart != NULL; i++)
    {
        if (pstart-&gt;nVersion &gt;= minVersion)

OP_CLTV (aka OP_HODL or OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) allows to block a coin until a certain date.
If you are doing multisig with a service like greenaddress, it means you can make a script with the following form :
    OP_IF 
        2 &lt;YourKey&gt; &lt;GreenAddressKey&gt; OP_MULTISIG
    OP_ELSE
        &lt;2020&gt; OP_CLTV OP_DROP &lt;YourKey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ENDIF
Which means that if for some reason greenaddress disappear, you'll be able to unlock your funds in 2020. It also allows you to make payment channel with someone else without having the risk they take your funds in hostage. (you send funds to a multi sig with the other participant with a branch using OP_CLTV and your key so you are sure if something goes wrong, you can get back your money)

You should think deeply about how such debt dependence is possible. It is because the creation of debt (bank's IOU) is a monopolized institution, and widely accepted form of money. Such problem does not map into Bitcoin, since it is impossible to make a widely accepted Bitcoin IOU, there is no benefit for a receiver to accept an IOU rather than real Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin economy such debt dependance is simply not possible.


Who pays for the "altenative measures" to insure holders and the irresponsability of the bank ? If you think "nobody", please, think again. In Bitcoin world there is two way to protect again it (from what happened to mtgox), one is insurance for the institution, which ultimately all their customer will have to pay indirectly, penalizing people who otherwise would not want it. Or simply storing btc on your own wallet.
Without such insurance, such "alternative measure" is called a baillout, which is nothing but a way to route wealth from taxpayer pocket to irresponsible bank institution and holder which did not made proper due diligence.
So is it better to see coins just disappear rather than the alternatives ? I prone that if bitcoin get lost, then nothing should be done. But that's up to everyone to think about their own money, and they have the choice to decide. Either with OP_CLTV with an insurer, or by holding Bitcoin IOU in insured exchanges.

Historically, the reason why people used paper money instead of gold was for portability and measurability reason. Not because paper money was more "reversible" than gold.
People switched from paper money to credit money, for transferability reason. A wire is better than paper money for sending on long distance, and also easier to secure on big amount.
Now Bitcoin enters the game and you think the same history than gold will repeat ? Bitcoin is the best portable, transferable, measurable, most easy to secure, most authentic form of money that can exist, People won't use it because it cannot be reversed ? Don't make me laugh.
Reversibility is not an attribute of money. Also if two persons are in the same juridiction, legal recourse can be used to get a refund, even with bitcoin.
The power of reversibility should not be in the hand of the issuer of the money. The decision to reverse should be in the hand of a judge, not a banker.

Companies owning a ledger who got the most trust in the previous age were called "Visa" and "Mastercard". But it has been proven, that they could not operate on a worldwide scale because of political issues. Will R3 solve where visa and mastercard failed ? I don't think so.

You spam your trades on the hub, then when you are done with spamming it, you just broadcast the final commitment on the blockchain. (one transaction)
You can still spam the blockchain directly if you are rich though, but would not stay rich for long. :p
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:33:14
I am not talking about size hard fork, those, from development perspective are very easy. (only need to update nodes)
Some node policy decisions like changing the default txminrelayfee for preventing spamming made way more damage to running code than a block size change would.
But changing the representation of a block or transaction will simply break all existing software in existence from hardware wallet, to a simple P2PKH payment. In lots of companies, (like blockchain.info I suspect) the smart developers are gone and the company could not fix the software without massive investement. 
Whereas with a softfork... everything just keep working. The price of breaking everything will also be felt because entrepreneur would consider that Bitcoin is not a stable plateform to build something on top of it.
The stability of bitcoin is the reason why I am developing on it, and not on another fancy chain like eth.

BTC having a market cap of X billion does not need that one can buy every coin with X billion.
If they do that, it will just move wealth out of their pocket, to our pocket. We'll get valuable fiat, and they'll get worthless coins (if they want to kill it).
Now, imagine that they destroy them so there is no bitcoin left... with the reward, new bitcoin will be created and some people will still buy them, for the same reason why we have them now: Financial freedom.
And this is unlikely that they manage to buy every satoshi... As long as there is some satoshi, there will be life.

This is non sense. Bitcoin is the purest form of capitalism.
Capitalism indeed means control of the capital, but it never meant "control of the capital by the state" or "control of the capital by state sponsored monopolies".
Capitalism is about private ownership of capital you earned without force. Free market is capitalism and capitalism is free market.
Our world now is not a capitalist world, where capital can be owned by abusing state intevention you are going either in socialism (if the money goes to the social justice warriors) or facism. (if the money goes to the banks or any protected industy)
The only system that isn't either of these property expropriation methods is indeed called capitalism.

This would not solve the problem, since micro payment are broadcasted only when the channel close, never before.


In such case, why using payment channel at all ? She can do the work for 1 one and deliver only when bob broadcasted payment in the blockchain, instead of using a micro payment channel.
Do you understand, that for each piece of work someone does in a payment channel NOTHING is sent to the blockchain ? If you send to the blockchain often, you loose the advantage of micropayment, which is decreasing fees.
In the extreme case she get paid by 1H time span of work, if she broadcast each hour then she does not need micro payment.
If she get paid every 10 min, then she save 10 times the fees. But she must not drop connection before the channel expires. You can't get at the same time the advantage of not taking the risk of being screwed up by a disconnection AND the small fees, you need to choose.

If a company get huge pile of money by providing great service, without needing the state, and expect to keep it all for themselves, then this is capitalism and this is free market.

So, first since the event "bitcoin are lost" is invisible to the blockchain, you would need an oracle to give you this information. This is still possible by using OP_CLTV long in the future so you give to an insurance the right to your coin after 2 years if they did not moved.
Then once again, if the coin are loss everybody become richer. So why doing such a thing ? If you say that some people need more "lost coins" than other, then who decide which are those people ?

Cancellable payments for one day can be sent with the following scriptPubKey (redeem in P2SH)

I agree this would not be practical. But if we start to think that it is ok to reverse payment by force. Then, it is also OK to replace miners by a central authority.
The loss suck, this is sure, but this is part of the game.
That said, if there is legal recourse for the OP to get back his money, he should try them by any mean.

Is it possible to implement SW in a cleaner way than the softfork without changing the data structure of a transaction or block (which would break everything) ? I am interested.


People will not choose, wallet provider will. You can be sure than wallet providers will very quickly implement the proposal.
Everybody care about paying 50% less fees, poor or rich.


My point is that the "import private key" will still work between software where it worked before.
I think the question is less about importing private key (which will increasingly become a deprecated idea because of HD wallets), and more about sweeping a balance from an old wallet.
Sweeping balances can be done by HD wallets with SW addresses, by providing an option which scan a private key and create a transaction sending that to a SW address derived from the HD. (Wallet like mycelium provided that for P2SH)

I don't follow you, the 32MB per message on the protocol is here to cover a technical risk.
All implementations currently create a memory buffer of the size of the message, then parse it into an object. Both means that a single message may take finally around 100MB, because of the overheads of creating C# or Java objects. (sure it may be optimized a bit)
Imagine there is 8 connection to your node, and 8 of them sends you a 32 MB message, then your ram is propelled up at 800MB.

What I mean is that what worked before will still be working, and will have no need to update.


Yes, but luckily most of used wallet will use it if only for fee reason.
But for example, I created a blockexplorer, and I am happy that it will not break and still work without intervention on my part.


It depends which services. Wallet for sure, if you have a block explorer you don't need, and for some services where the gain of fees is not worth it either.

There is too many potential services to do with Bitcoin to enumerate here, but it asks you to investigate how Bitcoin works technically speaking, why it is still alive, (Bitcoin can be trading at 1$, it would still serve its purpose) and why we are all so obsessed about it.
If you are entrepreneur, I assume you can understand some code so  is a good start. (my book)
Bitcoin changes existing paradigms so much that you can't understand until you enter in the rabbit hole. Also you have to look aside of tech circle to see the advantages from an economic, political, law and financial perspective. (search for Andreas Antonopoulos, and Nick Szabo to get a glimp) 
Bitcoin has a lots of facets, and few people master all. But there is a gigantic collaboration of people who would have never crossed their path to make Bitcoin a success, for the simple reason it does not only have a tech facet.
You must walk the path, nobody can do it for you.
Bitcoin is not sexy and does not need hype. While both would be good, it can stand on its own without it, and to know why it is possible, why whatever the consumer hype, even if  it drop to 1$ Bitcoin it still serves its purpose,  you need to learn about it.

Block size is an orthogonal concern completely unrelated to lightning. I would appreciate those concern not to be mixed.
 Segwit and lightning network multiply capacity of a block increase in an non contentious manner. So they are as important as the block increase itself.
For example if now you support X transaction and increase 2 times the block size, you can support 2 x X transactions right ?
But now if you add segwit, you can support 2 x X x 1.75.
If you add lightning you support 2 x X x 1.75 x 400.
400 here is arbitrary, but you can easily imagine doing 800 transaction by using only one lightning channel (which equates to 2 bitcoin transaction)

Well, you have the problem of loosing your wallet in the street or getting stolen. Not with bitcoin.
For fraud, we have a court system which is responsible to determine what is fraud and what is not, and use force to get money back, this responsability should never have fallen in the hands of bankers in the first place.
Yes you can have other accidents with Bitcoin... But saying that because of it nobody will ever use it is an exaggeration.

this libconsensus is very important since it will provide the benefit of diversity while removing fork conditions due to bugs.

I know well about micro payment transaction, I implemented myself a version of it.
If you open a micro payment channel between Bob paying Alice.
* Alice can close the channel which she wants.
* Bob can close and get the complete refund at channel timeout.
* All payments between Alice and Bob on the channel are done off blockchain. (if it was not the case, you would have to pay fees and thus micro payment would be impossible)
* If Alice drop connection, then Bob can complete refund at channel expiration.
Alice might trust a third party service to broadcast the payment before expiration. But the third party may collude with Bob to steal the funds.
There is also an attack that Alice can carry out with malleability which would have the effect of preventing Bob to make a successful refund in case of expiration, with the ultimate effect of extorting the funds of Alice. (gmaxwell explains it, and a fix, that bitcoinj does not implement :

You can limit the risk to some extent, but it is very difficult currently to explain to average Joe in a UI what is the risk of the payment channel, why there must be an expiration, why does he needs to "close the channel", why can't he spends the money he is earning before closing the channel.
This coupled with no existing implementation protecting against malleability. This is doable, but typically, the wallet developers just wait that popular framework implements it.
Then the fact that CLTV should be out soon.
This is a lots of stuff to think about for payment channel. 
Frankly, I think payment channel will only be implemented in two cases :
* For specific business models that requires it (changetip, streamium ?)
* In wallets, only if fees increase due to big usage of bitcoin, making an economical incentive to use payment channel to average Joe
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:00:08
Good point, but I would argue that a soft fork should be longer. Because there is no incentive to update when the miner will "just work" even if he does not update.

I certainly hope that the internal politics of a small number of developers will be irrelevant in the future. This is not the case right now, they are conscious about that, and I think they want to get rid of this burden. But right now they are not irrelevant.

I'll try to be short (I am developing a Colored Coin product, I'm not involved with sidechains) :
* Sidechains does not exist yet
* Sidechains tries to allow conversion from one crypto currency to another, without having to find another trader. (each crypto currency following different protocol, rules and blockchains)
* Colored Coins is a way to emit assets on the blockchain (commodity, currencies or other financial instruments) while having the cryptographic proof that they are emitted from some trusted party (typically a bank)
* A colored coins always need trusting the issuer not to fraud and maintain the convertibility to some rate. And you need other traders (or the issuing bank) to exchange back and forth in BTC. Anyone can emit a colored coin. The ownership of a colored coin is secured by the blockchain though.
* A sidechain, do not require trust in a central authority, but need miners to secure it (or proof of stake), so emitting your own secure sidechain is not really possible.

The design of most bitcoin project who does not want to depends on a third party API is the following : You have a background process which listen a configurable list of trusted node and index  incoming transactions and blocks in real time in a database.
Also, since this background process might shut down, when it starts, it need to catch up with the missed blocks.
Then the frontend (website or REST API) just query the database.
Since we can't expect the background process to have a compatible implementation of Bitcoin (because most of the time, it is not even in C++, and dynamic library of libconsensus is not released) the background process need to trust that incoming transactions and blocks are valid.
For broadcasting, it is the same problem. Imagine your background process receive demands from the front end for broadcasting a transaction. Since the background process can't validate the transaction by itself easily, the trick is to send the transaction to a trusted node, and see if it get rejected. (reject message of the protocol)
The background process is trusting all information it get from the node so running my own node is mandatory.
If I need to improve reliability of my service, I even need to run multiple instances of background processes + bitcoin node at the same time, in several regions. Using an untrusted node for such services might result in non obvious hacks. (A malicious node might broadcast double spent transaction, or attempt DOS by slowing down the connection, and all kind of other attack vectors to which I am glad the core devs already thought for me)

@_date: 2015-06-19 22:28:48
To what I understand it is not in the reference implementation.
I have not yet measured the pros and cons of RBF, but we can easily have a hacker providing a tool for script kiddies to double spend the transaction by broadcasting double spend of a coin accross the globe, simultaneously. If BitPay is not protected against that, then it will get bit anyway sooner or later.
Making double spend an "every day attack" means that services will be much more resistant to it.
I don't think BitPay would have to wait necessarily though. To what I undestand, RBF increases risks of the merchant only if he accepts a coin of a big chain of unconfirmed. Such thing is rare occurence and can be detected by Bitpay.
RBF does not permit to modify the inputs, isn it ?
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:51:46
yes it does, even though it happens I forget to open the port.
I maximize the connections I can get so the transactions I broadcast are harder to double spend, and I also receive other transactions faster.

@_date: 2015-06-19 18:31:20
What I am saying is that not everyone is required to run RBF because other people are running it. Having half the network using RBF and half another algorithm do not create two currencies nor will result in lawsuits because service providers chose the wrong choice for their users in hindsight.
Change in the consensus in dev term means any code change to the code in the libconsensus library. Block size is a change to this library while RBF is not. The consequence of one is to create two currencies, the consequence of the other have no impact at all, except an increase in successful double spent, triggered because the skill to make a successful one is decreased.
Btw, I do not support Gavin and Mike, even if I want the block size increase, Blockstream have nothing to do with my rational about it.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:11:09
You are wrong, if the merchant allow unconf, then it does not matter if he uses Bitpay or Coinbase, he can be attacked. Being a multi million funded company does not give them special power to protect against double spend.
If they block unconf with long chain of unconf already then nobody should fear RBF. But I doubt anybody tested that.
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:50:33

You misunderstood, contract's don't have to be into a lawyer terminology. A ScriptPubKey is a contract defining the condition for spending a coin, and a ScriptSig the fullfilment of conditions. The sole reason why bitcoin has succeed at first was when a popular website which have gone down since now started bitcoin escrow, and people were certain that the middleman could not steal money.
The point of bitcoin is enforcing contracts. A multi sig can't be spent even if a judge says so.
It has precisely to do with OP situation, a Coinjoin transaction can be seen as a Bitcoin contract, which does not need any lawyer and regulation to work.
The solution is not regulation for fixing bitcoin, the solution is more self enforcing contract (which marketing guy call smart contract) so we don't need regulation to not be scammed.

It is. The reason is that such oligarchy can keep their money only by fulfilling customer's wishes. In our current system they can stay in power even without fulfilling our wishes because of various government protection. This is the point of Hayek.




You equates capitalism and concentration of money. Do not use cartelization, a cartel by definition use force (violence, or state) to survive, as you say later. Concentration of money is not a problem, once again the problem is when people not contributing to society by creating services get the money.


I agree on everything you say, except, as you pointed out, the definition of capitalism and the thought that concentration of capital is a bad thing. In a free market, concentration of capital can happen if you provide superior services, which is not a bad thing. Anyway, I have big doubt that in a free market concentration of capital will be as impressive as now. Most of big corporations could reach such height by using state's power. (patent, subsidies, offshoring so all competitor pay taxes but not you, protectionism etc...)

Sure, imagine Bob pays Alice.
Bob &amp; Alice sign the full refund to Bob with locktime in 48H.
Alice does the work for 30H, and get paid by Bob for it. She does not have broadcasted anything because she tought working a little bit more for Bob before broadcasting the full payment.
Alice looses the connection for 20H, when she get back, she find that Bob broadcasted the full refund. (the locktime expired)
She can broadcast her payment, but it will be considered double spend of the refund and refused by the network.

What I thought afterward that is that it would be nice to fix the problem. However, I don't think the heart of bitcoin will stop, as miners will prefer mine at loss than seeing bitcoin die. In a perfect world, miners should acknowledge the problem and ask for solutions before it happens so they do not loose money. In practice, they don't care and will just continue to mine at loss for a while until adjustment.

because for every problem you want to solve, there is another layer of debate and opinions which further blocks any progress.
I think it is better hard fork to be specific and obvious, and not resolve all bitcoin problems at once. With BIP66 and BIP34, we have seen that when a consensus is reached, the change do not take enormous time to be effective. (6 months approximately)
The 32MB limit will be a problem whose solution may be obvious once we reach the problem, but are not for now, so I think it is a good idea to not solve the problem right now in BIP100, so we have some chance to reach consensus.

I did not wanted to talk on reddit about the idea first, since I'm doing it for the dev community, and wanted to know if there was any strong opposition to that for security reasons.
The goal is to give useful metrics for devs about what would happen when the blocks will be full, mempool full, and UTXO set exploding.
If anything really bad happen, I will shutdown the service.
By having more objective metrics about what will happen, I hope we will unlock the situation.

This is right, the price of running my node is reported to the users of my service. Which is fine, since this is part of the infrastructure I need for my service.
If operating a node become more expensive because there is more bandwidth/storage needed, then the cost just bubble up to the service of the user. 
One thing is sure : I will not stop having my own trusted node, no matter what is the cost in term of bandwidth and storage.

How do you explain the difference between a Bitcoin account and a Bitcoin wallet to a new user ?
Someone coming from the traditional banking system already know the difference between and account and a wallet.
Sadly, the term "bitcoin account" has been used by bitcoin core, because of its now deprecated way to put a label on an address. (which is why you are still using this term)

No, jgarzik has always be very clear about that for example. (read his BIP 100, which I support, and he said it several time in the mailing list)
You can ask to the core devs : should you become the one who decides about what is "good decentralization", "good fee market", "good bitcoin" ? they will tell you : no it is not our role. Nobody enjoy the situation and it is clear nobody want such situation happens again.
The problem is about getting the burden off their shoulder without putting the network at technical risk. And this is not a simple problem.

Adam Back is very right to warn that the behavior of Gavin is worrisome and can make a dangerous precedent against cryptocurrencies in general, very few people understand what a fork of the chain really mean.
From what I have seen of Adam's proposal, they are clearly not realizable without major work all around the industry. It is irresponsible to say : here is a way to support more MB... but all the industry (merchants/wallet provider/btc service providers) will need to change their code to support such scheme. Freaking academia dementia. Developers and businesses are not at the whim of people who decides to "incentives them (aka force them)" to develop something they would not otherwise.
But the point in this mail is not about solutions, but about the behavior to "force" a change to happen. I am for lifting the limit. But Bitcoin is hard to change for a good reason ! This is what make it resilient against political attacks.
If the bruteforce of Gavin passes, it would severly undermine my belief about what Bitcoin is. Hopefully, I don't think it has a chance. Miners and services providers are better aware about what a fork of blockchain really mean, and I doubt they want that to happen.

And once again I tell you that you are wrong because of two points :
* The possible malleability attack of the payee (which allow extortion)
* The risk of connection of the payee dropping before closing the channel
I am the developer of NBitcoin, the bitcoin library we use in .NET (what some wallet developer uses for their apps). I know well the tradeoff around micro payment channel since I have implemented it in my library also. You are just wrong about how safe is a payment channel as implemented in BitcoinJ (and in NBitcoin, since I don't follow yet the recommendation of gmaxwell).

Citing luke-jr


The majority of reddit users sadly do not understand what an hard fork implies. But it is very clear in developer's mind, it is the creation of a new currency, an altcoin. Whether the branding "Bitcoin" will be used for one or the other side of the fork is another story.
Once again this is not a play with the word trick to convince anybody, it is a plain fact. Sure you are revolted I use the negatively connoted term "altcoin", but this does not modify the facts. (I recall, I am in favor of increasing the block size)
We managed to trick banks to use the term "blockchain" instead of "bitcoin", for removing the bad connotation. But when we talk in technical term, you have to be clear and concise and keep the connotation at bay. Between devs, we talk about "Bitcoin", and we talk about "altcoin" for denoting what does not follow the main chain of the bitcoin repo.

Aside for SW, I think it is very clear miners want an increase, and devs are not stricly opposed to it.
If it starts to get hot, I think it is very clear that BIP102 (2MB bump) is the best candidate which would make everyone happier than the status quo. I am confident the problem is solved on the short and middle term. There is still no consensus on the long term, but what we will learn until then will probably help to find a solution we are still not thinking about, or giving important data to evaluate current proposals in a better way.

This is my main complain when people are panicking : OMG WHAT IF ****** HAPPENS, WE ARE ALL DOOMED.
This is wrong, the reason is, the ecosystem (not only the currency) is sufficiently decentralized, then any attack against it create incentive to defend against it and while closing the crack. Bitcoin is not a static ship, it is morphing by individual actions of the peers which compose it.
We saw that with spam: first attempt to disrupt was a success, now nobody care. There was not one remedy, but several which got implemented rather quickly. (dynamic fee, mintxrelayfee, better spam filter...)

Understand that wallet developers know better than anyone the state of Bitcoin and where the wind will blow. The problem is that bitcoin developer are very few, and open source does not pay the bills.
If you want more work on that, I advise you either : support the wallets by giving bigger donations, or even paying them for their time to implement on their wallet. 
OR become a bitcoin developer yourself.
More over you said :


This note a lack of understanding about what a payment channel is. When you pay on a micro payment channel, by definition, you are not using the blockchain, and you are obliged to depend to a third party service. (which can be untrusted, but if you don't trust it, then it means that you need to have, as a user, constant internet connection. Because failing to broadcast the transaction before the channel expire will result in theft).
How to explain, as a wallet provider, to the user that they lost their funds because their android phone was not powered on before the channel expiration ? (well, in practice I think we can hope a third party to broadcast for you... but if they forget to do it for technical outage and the fund of the payee get stolen by the payer, who is to blame and bear the risk ?)
Moreover the way BitcoinJ implement channel will soon be obsolete with OP_CLTV, and developers don't want to waste free time on something they will need to change soon.
And last thing, the way bitcoinJ implement that is weak to malleability. (I can't go deep into the details, but in worst case, the payer lost all his fund and the payee also, gmaxwell had a solution that work for that I don't remember exactly, but this is not what bitcoinj use)
If something is obviously needed but not implemented, it is not because wallet developers are ignorant about it, far from it. But there is deep technical limitations, risk, that we can't explain easily to someone who has no idea about how it works. And we also need to present that nicely in a UI that don't hide the risks away, but that the user can still understand this is not simple.

wow I did not know about the unsafe version. I'm a bit surprised that peter todd proposed the unsafe one. I think his rational is that if double spend is already possible, then increase the odds of succeeding does not change anything.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:22:10
You are misinformed. It would take me too much time to explain, but you are wrong.


It won't. The people that choose software (be it wallet, exchange, btc services) using the wrong side of the chain will not be interoperable with the other chain. 
People will not be able to send money from one service to the other, even if both are labeling themselves "Bitcoin".
Then to explain the situation, you will have to explain to Joe that the blockchain forked, and he does not have Bitcoin anymore, but "BitcoinClassicCoin" for every coins used after the fork.
You will have then wallet devs charged to clean up the mess, telling to their user they choose on their behalf which chain they are. And the users will complain that their chain is loosing resulting in coins unspendable in the second one and sue to get refund for the bad choice of the wallet developers. (which most likely work for free, like me)
It is not even to debate whether BitcoinXT should be considered altcoin or not. Technically, it is when they planned the hard fork in code. If you don't want to call a dog a "dog" because you don't like the word, then be it.
If the reputation of someone cloud your judgment on the rational arguments he makes then be it.

In fact, no need of blockchain for that.
Create your document, encrypt it with a private key. Then break your private key with shamir's secret, and spread the fragments and the encrypted document across your family in person. With the instruction to join the fragments for retrieving the key and decrypt the document if you disappear.
Very geeky, no easy to use services for that AFAIK, but the most secure thing to do without intermediary.

Lowering the cost (in technical term) of doing a successful double spend certainly means that services will be better protected against it.
I am not in favor of the unsafe version of it though, and I am neutral on the "safe version".
I am neutral mainly because there are other ways of lowering cost of double spend, that would have happened anyway in the future. (like a hacking website providing to script kiddies a way to make successful double spend -with high % success rate- to an address in one click)

The inherent value of a good is the value you derive only from his use value (consumption), or industrial use. Exchange value being to zero. (Mises)
Saying Bitcoin has no inherent value is far fetched.
If Bitcoin loose its exchange value, it will keep its industrial use which is : world wide, censorship resistant, wealth transfer network.
If, more than its industrial use, the good is durable, divisible, transportable, unspoofable, then it get all the requirements to make it a currency.
People use a currency because it solves a problem and also by habits. Using it from faith is speculation. 
Bitcoin can solve lots of problem that other can't. We are not completely here yet though... Working on it.

Being a smallest denominator is the only way to be accepted worldwide. Compare that to why Flash and Silverlight were trashed in favor of HTML5... it was indeed the smallest denominator and both other technologies were strictly superior.
I don't believe you are a developer, or one who already worked in the industry. Thinking it is fine to break 100% of bitcoin services codebase for a feature "because it is cleaner", when the same thing can be achieved without breaking anything, and on top of that thinking that there can be consensus (meaning service providers will open their arms to have their code broken) is pure ponyland fiction.

The french Maquis were free, in the psychological sense, while the vast majority of the population were slave which would report the Maquis so Nazi don't mistreat them.


Two choices: Being born as slave does not necessary mean your life is bad if you have good master. Such slave would be psychologically free if happy of his existence.
If he get mistreated: He can refuse it by fleeing and fighting or killing the master or teaming with other slaves. 
I don't say it is easy, I just say that this is what it means to "be free" in the psychological sense. What Kanye refers as "breaking the mental prison", and what he refers as "being slave is a choice". Being free, in the psychological sense does not depend on external circumstances.

It is impossible to protect privacy and prevent "crimes" at the same times.
Either you allow your privacy to be violated, reject tor, and permit someone else to define what a "crime" is on your behalf.
Either you don't give up your privacy, accept tor, and define what a "crime" is with your own code of values.
Tor is an indispensable tool to protect any individual acting according to his own code of values.
Any attack on Tor is taken for an attack on every free individuals (ie acting according to their own values), and a step to totalitarism.
Do you think satoshi would have been able to spread Bitcoin so far if he did not stayed anonymous ? 
I might be wrong, but I doubt it, I suspect he would have been prosecuted for creating a currency without license.

Now the point of leading to centralization on coinbase is true as well, but the current fees are negligible. If people use coinbase for transfering btc it is not because of fees today, but for convenience.
Now, you are thinking devs are opposed to a bump, and you are wrong on that. Even peter todd said (in scaling btc) he would not oppose a small bump if we really become full.

If you use it to monetize your surplus of free space, then yeah.
If you use it as a source for profit, or long term solution for storing mass of confidential data in the cloud, then no. You have to compare what cost hosting X TB in premise versus cloud.

1 million, 21 million, 42 million, or billion of BTC available make no difference. (Except if one satoshi become too much for buying a cup of coffee, but if that happen, I suspect my problems will be elsewhere)

A simple counter example is Andreas Antonopoulos speaking with regulators for bitcoin without putting himself as a central authority for the matters.
I agree with BookstoreProwler. The problem is not about a group advocating for Bitcoin, it is about a group obviously wanting centralized political power to change bitcoin, at least this is how I perceive them. 
The fact that core developers get funded from them does not bother me so much, they are smart enough to get auto funded if they really need to so, I don't think core developers can be weakened or influenced by political or financial pressure.

The only thing I read about CoinShuffle is here : 
But if you don't specially need it, nor want to go to much in the nitty gritty of crypto, NBitcoin also lack a Wallet implementation. There is also some people that wanted to create and parse BrainWallet address.


If you are training making scripts and transaction, then you will like this article 


There is no other type of p2p network. Open Assets are exchanged on the bitcoin network. Open Asset is only a different way to build transaction so we can attach transferable assets to transaction outputs.
The beauty of it is that the specification is simple enough once you understand how transactions work, but still extensible :

You are right.


In any case, you always need to rely on trust that the issuer will not fraud. No cryptographic workaround will prevent an issuer to fraud.
But let's say you make the following contract : "My company has the Bitcoin Address X, 10% of all revenue stream will go share owner".
If this contract have a JSON representation in the asset definition file, then tools can be made either to enforce it (on your good will as the issuer), or to enforce it (so your stakeholder are notified if the contract is not fulfilled).


Anything that you need and is not in NBitcoin is a good field to study.

It can work in three way with Bitcoin Core.
First, there is an RPC implementation so you fetch them through it, but it is slow.
Second, there is a protocol implementation, so you can connect to a Bitcoin Core node and use Node.GetHeaders() and Node.GetBlocks() to fetch blocks from the node.
However, in your case, the most efficient way is to run your local node with bitcoin core, and use the BlockStore class. This class will enumerate Bitcoin core's downloaded blocks directly from the file system. I heavily micro optimized this part so it is really efficient. (using it a lot)

You are not alone, also in this case.
But unlike you, I don't intend to convince them, nor using their point of view for judging bitcoin.
Being smart is not about passing a test.
Have the courage to judge things with your own mind. And you can only judge by learning deeply about the inner working of Bitcoin, so you can imagining new products and services it permit.
Most people don't like to judge because few like to learn and prefer using an authority's judgment instead of their own.
So if you intend to convince a friend, do not try to convince him with logic and details. See the background where he comes from and point to him an authority he respects defending Bitcoin.

Indeed, many good with use value had an exchange value in the past.
Rice for example were "Durable, Divisible, Transportable, Unspoofable" and thus used as a medium of exchange.
Gold arose from the same reason, their initial acceptability was rooted not in belief of a medium of exchange, but in their use/industrial value. 
This use value is what some people call "inherent value", which is a term that is so vague and used for all reason that it lost its meaning. Which is why I prefer saying "use/industrial value".
The use/industrial value of gold is not really relevant compared to its exchange value nowadays. But the reason why it started to be used as a medium of exchange was because of its use value in jewel, and the divisibility/durability/transportable/unspoofable properties I enumerated.
People who says "bitcoin can't succeed as a currency because of no inherent value" are referring to this initial use value that can spark a new money in the first place.
The response to give to them is not that Bitcoin has no inherent value, but that it has. (the blockchain)
This plus the fact that this is durable, divisible, transportable and unspoofable above all competing currencies make it a great candidate for use as a currency. 
Which is why you can say (and I quote you) : "How could it ever lose its exchange value if it has a use for a group of people", response : "It can't"
However you can observe that rice lost its exchange value. And the reason was that Gold was more "Durable, Divisible, Transportable, Unspoofable". Which is what can happen to bitcoin, but I think we have several years before it happens. And if such competing currencies appear as side chain, then, it will make BTC even more useful (blockchain), so I don't think we would be greatly impacted.

You misunderstood me. I am fan of Rand's philosophy, but this ted talk goes against objectivism.

We collaborate on Bitcoin because each of us have self interest into it, not because we want the good of society or of the "super organism" as he calls it. Selfishness does not prevent collaboration. And selfishness is why bitcoin works.

No this is not what a bank does.
If it did, a bank would never have needed a bailout, as the financial crisis, or bail in for cyprus customers.
If it did, you would not need to pay a financial advisor to protect the fiat in the bank you are sure are devaluating. Sure the banks does protect from physical robbery, but it does not from inflation. 
Buffet does not care about all of that, he has protectors for his money against the banking system but we have not. He can hide his money were he wants legally. He knows insider information to make his bucks from share holding instantly, he does not care really care about the fees.

"Data Protection" is the responsibility of the individual, not the state. So I don't think it is a bad thing that they relax that. On the contrary, I see that as a move to fewer government intervention.
If you care about privacy, just use services that respect it.
Before downvote : I am NOT saying that I accept privacy violation by the state for any reason.
Just saying that companies to which I handled my data voluntarily should be free to do what they want with it. This is not the government role to prevent that from happening, since it is unenforceable, and would allow a whole range of excuse for putting their nose in company's data processing. (or decide stupid law like obliging them to put a popup on their website saying that they are using http cookie)

This is one. Not increasing because of technical uncertainty is a valid reason which is not controversial. I expect there will be a higher hard limit for a while combined with an auto incremental limit.
The hard limit will be removed when technical uncertainty will come, without controversy, since the algorithm for increase will already be agreed on.


This is an economic reason of a typical central banker. Deciding which incentive to give to which type of business.


I don't agree, I am happy with how discussion is going on the mailing list, I'm more confident that the solution will be uncontroversial.


Well, you can disagree, but it is common knowledge than most of the network will follow the main version. And you will loose by not following.


If not everyone agree, then it means a good solution must not use a specific number, nor a specific timeline. It means the question is not well asked. Not that there is no solutions.
Let me quote Hayek to explain my point about how a good legal rule, in our case, a hard fork solution, is one where we can't predict winners from losers :


to foretell who will be the lucky ones or whom disaster will
strike, that rewards and penalties are not shared out according
to somebody's views about the merits or demerits of different
people, but depend on their capacity and their luck, is as
important as that in framing legal rules we should not be able
to predict which particular person will gain and which will
lose by their application.
And that it is important to act in accordance to imperfect knowledge, than crystal balling them.


Every decision that reach consensus does not have obvious looser and winners. And surprisingly a lot of them are taken everyday OPCLTV for example (I may criticize Peter Todd for polarizing people, but his contribution to the code is rarely controversial and always valuable). The simple solution hard, kick in the can, block limit was not passing this test, thus was controversial. But again, they are finding solutions that I am happy to see, can reach consensus without compromise to be made.

Since it is possible to make a transfer between 2 crypto currency in an atomic way without central party, moving from one to the other is easy to do. Even more when side chains will be ready. (but we don't need it)
The move from one crypto to another will be easier and faster than the move from fiat to crypto for this reason.

For people not knowing : Predictions market are a way to bet for/against certain event, so the financial impact if that event occurs is absorbed/leveraged. This is what we call an hedging instrument, because it allows you to protect your wealth in case some events happen, a bit like an insurance.
The term "prediction" comes from the fact that people who have internal knowledge of the company, will bet correctly, because it is for their own interest. Thus, the result of a prediction market is more likely to be the future.

You are right, and this is what is happening and what is dangerous. Those tradeoff should not be taken by core devs. The economic impact it would have is exactly what central bankers are doing.
What is "good enough centralization", or "good enough fee market", should  not be taken by an individual.


When you model a system with game theory you have to decide about the payoff function. Deciding what this payoff function is, is what central bankers do. The resulting conclusions are as good as how payoff function is modeled.
Take an example of a game : TCP exponential backoff, which is the policy of reemitting a packet on internet if no ACK is received.
You might be tempted to model the payoff function by saying : An actor will always favorise minimum latency, which sound very reasonable. But if you do that, it means people will NOT use exponential backoff, and, as a result, internet would not be as reliable as now.
But in practice, you can see that nobody is changing their TCP implementation for switching from exponential backoff to more spammy behavior, even if it would be for their own good.


The problem is that their is no way for users to vote, any attempt to such vote would not be sibil resistant. A vote of miner IS resistant, because of the cost of being miner.
Imagine that "user should dictate". In such anonymous and untrusted system that bitcoin is, which users are you talking about ? who has more right ? how do they vote ? how do you ensure there is no double vote ?
I'm not saying that miner voting is the best solution, I'm reading about other good solutions people are proposing. My point is that no decision should be taken by justifying with "it will be good for the bitcoin economy", but more about "we are keeping ourselves out of the loop", or "it is dangerous for the stability of bitcoin core".
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:46:09

I like his contribution in bitcoin as a developer.
My main complaint, to which he is not the only one to fall into, is hearing him talking about things he does not know. And people who does not know that he does not know assume legitimacy because of his involvement as a bitcoin core dev.
It takes a good deal of humility to keep your mouth shut on matter you do not know when a crowd is waiting for your words. (The majority of core devs can do it)

Good point, for the case of a book when you open it you see the copyright first. But this would beg the question "what if you know the content of the book because a friend told you", or in the case of music, if you heard it on the radio without asking for it.
If we want to be consistent, in such case since there is no voluntary exchange (you know about the material without asking for it) the copyright should be disregarded.
But truth is, in our current legal system, the copyright holder does not have to prove that the violator accepted the copyright by opening the book or CD. (I may be wrong ?) This make it indistinguishable with a patent.
If that's the case, you are right, the point of Rothbard on copyright seems naive.

What stops institutions to make their own easy to use coin which can compete with Bitcoin is regulation and politics. This is not a technological issue. The issues that make digital fiat money a pain to use are politics and regulation.
Bitcoin is not affected by either.
I would be happy to have a worldwide trusted and usable fiat. But it just does not socially scale because of politics.
Truth is, I can more easily exchange my Bitcoin in Tokyo than I can exchange my dollar on PayPal against yen. Would switch gladly to a fiat based system with low fee if possible... except it is not. And I doubt it will.

We all agree on that, this is a subject where there is consensus.
What I am saying is that when a group of person, be it core dev or not, take decisions that penalize some business and not other for their own conception of "economic goodness", then they are acting as central bankers. Even if they do not touch the printer.
When there is controversy between devs, it means that we are no longer talking about how to make the system resistant of outside political pressure, it means the bitcoin system IS currently being attacked by political means. As long as people are crystal balling about the future of the network, what is reasonable, what is good and what is not, and taking decisions based on belief, we are no longer decentralized.
The only reason core devs should take is based on not crashing the network, and helping decentralization *if there is no cost*. If they do like that, there will be consensus, without compromise to be made.

Currently the hash calculation use the signature. It is an assumption that all code written on top of Bitcoin have. Changing that without backward compatibility mean that all old software will break. 
This mean that this would require enormous technical ressources in the industry to rewrite their software. And the new software would all go live at the same time, without being able to test easily before.
If you want to prevent that and keep backward compatibility, then segwit is the simplest way to do it.

I have no metric, except that bitcoin core must run and not crash or it would bring the whole system done. (systemic risk)


Nobody has to take the decision about how many is reasonable. This can be delegated either to miner, or through a policy which evolve automatically on storage/bandwidth WITHOUT ANY speculation about their evolution in the future. They are talking about solutions on the mailing list that seems to take the right way.


When tradeoffs impact businesses, you enter the realm of central banking speculating about how the economy work. This is a system we don't want, and I think there is consensus on that.


As I repeat, when somebody, or a group, take decision based on speculation of what is good and how the future will be, that they decide to "give incentive" for development into some domain, then, they are manipulating the economy. There is no need of a bitcoin printer for being a central banker.

Segwit is easy to understand. The consensus layer code is not super complex. Saying "Segwit HF is cleaner", is not a right argument, it will just be a move of code for putting merkle tree of witness from one part (coinbase), to another part. (block header)
Doing it that way, while not really changing Bitcoin Core code, would break every imagineable piece of software built on top of Bitcoin. So I can safely say it won't be done.
I hope there will be a HF some days for cleaning some technical debts in Bitcoin, but segwit as HF is not in the wishlist as you don't want to break existing software.
There is way to simplify a bit segwit by removing the discounting used for the SF block size bump, and making a block size HF instead, this would break no software and maybe make segwit code a bit simpler. But then we loose the advantages explained by [andreas]( And even still, I am not sure how hard is the code solving quadratic hashing compared to the discount trick.

Altcoins will have the same problem if they reach bitcoin's maturity. May or may be not about blocksize, but no crypto currency is protected from a disagreement which split it. As long as individual is responsible in choosing which chain they follow, there will be this tension. If you don't want this tension, giveout your right of choosing the good chain to someone else... but it won't be decentralized currency anymore.
In a sense the current tension is the result of the design of Bitcoin, not a result of specific people. Whether people will adapt to the design or go back in a safe zone currency where they are not free to follow the chain they want is a question always open.

Please, respond to my question :
Storage is cheaper in datacenters, which mean most nodes will be hosted in Azure, AWS, and google storage.
Such service does not make pay for ingress traffic, only for egress.
So a rational node (ie wanting to maximize his profit) will provide proof of storage to respond to heartbeats and get paid, but never deliver the content. I read through your article several time, and did not see anything addressing this point.
The only mitigation I see is if you get paid while delivering the content, thus paying the egress charges of the cloud provider.
"Clients and farmers can exchange SJCX for
bandwidth and storage space on the network."
Seems good in theory, but after that, you are covering only the storage part of the deal, not the bandwidth :
"The client pays the farmer after the completion of a heartbeat"
Hope there will get more details on the nittygritty of how you'll implement the payment in the protocol and particulary the payment. (Hope that OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY will release soon, since I guess it will be a critical component of the micro payment channel you want to create between client and nodes)

If some wants, and other don't want to update, there will be a fork, which will create an altcoins, and greatly damage everybody, way worst than a bug in the software making the blockchain stops for a while.


When you start taking decision which will impact business using the money, you are impacting the economy, even if you don't print the bills. They should not have this role, nobody should. (I think that most of core devs know it, and don't want either)
The bitcoin armageddon is not a bug in core bringing down the network for some hours. It is an ideological fork. If a change is controversial there will be a fork. And it will always be controversial if you start using metrics they believe should be maximized for the good of all.

I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer, and before falling into bitcoin I was hired by several training centers which sent me to their customers.
A course of one week for £2500 is a standard price. I am surprised it is not higher as it is way harder to find a bitcoin trainer than a C# trainer.
A standard trainer by itself cost around £800 per day, sometimes more.
The high cost of training (in france) come from government regulations, in one of three ways:
-Some companies get state subsidies for sending their employee to some approved training centers. 
-Most have a state enforced minimum budget to spend on training
-Some people come for free because of some numerous state employment program reserved for approved training center
As such not only employers are desensitised by the price. But also being approved training center is difficult, paperwork being a huge barrier of entry for competition. 
Those two forces drives training price more than what they are worth without state intervention.
The best place to be in such case, is like I did before I fell in the bitcoin rabbit hole: The trainer, the training center or both if you can handle paperwork and know the good persons.
Those getting ripped off are employees, but they all think that "the state and my company pay for my training, so it is free"... I will not contradict them, and take their money.

Imagine a world where bitcoin drop dramatically due to the fact nobody keep it.
However, Alice needs to send money from A to B but for whatever reason she is unable to do so on swift or mastercard.
The  only way to get around is to buy bitcoin, send them. Then Bob, the recipient, exchanges them directly with fiat in his own country.
In such case, Bitcoin value be very low because nobody would hodl. Nevertheless, Alice transferred money to Bob, this is direct utility.
If Alice keeps the need to use it, or if Bitcoin offer service that no other can, eventually she will stop converting back and forth to fiat to avoid exchanges fees, making Bitcoin develop as a currency.

Older nodes don't have "to trust" segwit transaction, if they receive one malicious, first it won't appear in their wallet because not standard when unconf, and then will never get confirmed. It is a soft fork, meaning that enforcement depends solely on what miners agree to put into their block, you never had the power over it in the first place. 
100% of nodes prune is not today possible yet, but theorically possible.
For any service (except archeology) or validating wallet, only the UTXO is really used. We can have only prune node in several ways with some compromise by having UTXO commitment in blocks.
Basically a new fully validating node would only need to download the current UTXO the current block, verify against the UTXO commitment hash in the block and then download and verify some past blocks just to verify if PoW is enough to not be faked. 
You can also have a future where all the historical blocks are distributed by some very priced services (a bit like when you want to buy stock history today with a good enough frequency), and people really needing the history would be able to buy it there and get it shipped by mail in a harddrive. (sneaker net still effective for very big data)
There is still not the need now, nor are we ready for it. But when storage and sync time will start to become a problem, it will naturally appear. It is just good to know that if storage becomes a problem in the future, nothing except UTXO can be pruned.

I am a teacher as well as .NET trainer for companies. I also wrote NBitcoin, the main .NET library for bitcoin. I think, by my past experience in those both my advice might interest.
Making one big exercice "bitcoin bank" will brain overflow them, you have to take small steps.
The problem is that for new students the learning curve is already huge, and adding Bitcoin to the mix will just kill them.
So start with the classical exercice of a virtual bank to learn security programming and web services.
Then once they are comfortable enough, ask them to refactor the code to use another implementation of such bank. (ie, not breaking existing code, but still allowing another implementation of a bank)
This will teach them unit tests, refactoring and encapsulation. (because you can't refactor easily unless having unit tests)
Then once they have done that, you ask them to change the implementation to support real Bitcoin with some popular web service, so you don't dive deep in the nitty gritty. (like blockchain info)
And if they ask more about bitcoin, then ask them to make a new implementation that do not depend on a popular bitcoin web service. (steep learning curve here though)

You can see the alternatives [here](
I will stop following the advancement, it is clear that I can't influence anything if I can't implement it (and it is normal thing). Also I'm tempted to believe that the other alternatives are better than my proposition ( and  MagicalTux also twitted a solution which seems fine and uncontroversial. (maybe he is not the author)


The term "Abuse" should not be defined by specific group of person, let the miners (by not mining) and users (by not relaying) decide what this mean. Except if it mean exploiting a weakness in bitcoin core.


What is "hickup" ? if you mean a technical glitch, then yes this question is worth asking. Do we need to take action now ? yes, and we all understand why.


We all agree that decentralization is better. But it comes at a cost which is different business to business. And the core devs should not decide which cost to choose, which is exactly the same as to choose which business to kill. When you see that happening, don't be surprised to see clan wars instead of rational debates happening. (some back and forth between some core devs were not about rational debates)
The alternatives proposed are trying to find uncontroversial solution to implement quickly, and I think it will happen. 


To a certain extent. I think we agree that if tomorrow all devs agree to go for 20MB, then the node operator and miners will follow, because it is common knowledge that other people will likely follow what is on bitcoin.org.
Once again, when there is controversy it means that some people loose, and other win over a decision. Some business are hurt, some other are advantaged. Developers should not choose which are which.
But I am somewhat happy that the other alternatives (maybe more by now) are not controversial while fixing the situation. The debate "20MB : YES OR NOT" was controversial, which mean the question was not the right one.
In other word, a core dev should not base his decision by saying : "The community need blocks 90% full for an healthy economy because scarcity is good for the blockchain" (I'm believing that, but this is controversial, and such economical argument should not drive bitcoin code evolution)
Or another example "Given that the bandwidth goes up by 10% every year, and storage cost halve by 2 every year, then the rate of growth of the bitcoin limit should be of 30% every year".
I'm inventing number, but I have seen such arguments.

Actually bitcoin scalling can be done on several layers. 
If the bottom layer (Core) was doing all the scaling without any resistance, the upper layers like exchanges and wallet, would not need to work to improve. Shifting all the scaling work to bitcoin core take lots of valuable resources that can be used for other more worthwhile bitcoin improvement.
Needless to say that bitcoin is mostly maintained by volonteer, while wallets and exchanges are heavily funded and thus have more resources to find solution for scaling than a team of volunteer developers.
I predicted in the past that the spam attack result would only invalidate their claims. (can't find my post back sadly)

By following your logic, there should be one stock on the NASDAQ because all trader will buy the most profitable one.
That's not the case, they will search the most profitable strategy, which does not mean going on the same coin.
The higher the competition, the most difficult it becomes to make profit. So it can cause some of them, who does not manage to make profit on the chain Coin A to switch on CoinB where there is still profit.
If switching from CoinA to CoinB comes at a cost, then it becomes strategic to have part of mining power in both coins as a way to hedge yourself against the fluctuation of profit mining between both.
Your premise "everyone will go to the most profitable" is shaky, because by doing that the profit disappear.
Miner allocating their hardware on several coins is not different from an investor investing in several stocks, both do can do it for speculation, for hedging, or for entrepreneurship by innovating on chips.

@_date: 2016-03-26 11:30:16
To an old node a segwit transaction is a normal transaction with scriptSig empty.
When confirmed, the old node will see it as any normal transaction. When unconfirmed, the transaction will not appear in the old node interface, nor relayed because it is considered non standard. (The execution of scriptSig + scriptPubkey leaves item in the stack, this is valid but not standard)
Exception is SPV wallet, where it will appear even when unconfirmed, as SPV never verify the standardneess of incoming transactions.


I don't undesrtand this question, as old node don't have segwit addresses, they can't think they can spend from them. Under their rules, yes they think a segwit address owning money can be spent by them, but such spending will never be accepted by miners, nor shown in any UI, nor relayed by other nodes.

Saying "the blocksize is too big" is different from saying "1MB forever".

Well actually I think I will put the book on github. Word is fine for writing, but people can't participate in it. When I'll do that, I will put more proper borders. But aside from the purely aesthetical aspect, you may think the content is itself unstructured.
My approach is very "practical" in the sense that, contrary to other book, I want the reader to not only learn about bitcoin, but understand how the code look like. This is a different teaching style than most book which focus on theory, then have "practical exercise" part aside.
This is a teaching style I'm also using when I give training to companies in .NET programming. My other trainers colleague find such approach "unstructured", and actually in the past I was refused to work in some training center because of this approach. Sometimes it had the inverse result: the training center loved it.
So in the end I would say you will love it or hate it.
Generally my students love it because it engages them. 
You have to give a try. :)

Good point, if we couple that for the fact that a spamming attack will probably happen at this time. (such that a shiny armor knight can save us)
A block size bump won't help a lot though. As I calculated the fees would need to be bumped around x20 times to completely absorb the loss of miners.
So a PR ready to merge which only fix the retargetting algorithm should be done just in emergency case, not a big deal to code it seems.

If it was so sure, I think the consensus to increase would already have been reached.
And I agree with you to some extent, people will find a way to get around the limit with alt coins anyway. (Gavin already pointed that out)
I'm just saying that a fork of the ecosystem in 2 at this point will be more painful than a 1MB limit. (Which make me believe that other core devs will start think about it more urgently, this is what gavin's his expecting from this message I bet)

I am not a good mathematician, but if I would need a model that can predict how much time it will take to confirm a transaction given its fees, I'll take a look at the source code of Bitcoin Core. Gavin's implemented a good enough version of it.

What I think will happen is core devs imposing a upper hard limit for technical uncertainties + some sort of automatic limit reevaluation formula of block size either based on miner vote or some blockchain usage metric.
The new upper hard limit would be easy to remove later on since the reevaluation formula would already be agreed on. I am speculating, but this seems to me the only way core devs decentralize decisions and reach a consensus, while protecting against technical uncertainties.
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:13:50
If you think other crypto are protected from shills you are misguided.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:59:24
I think lots of it is due to simple hubris and frustration to be ignored. (Bitcoin inherent design works against them, by making their noise irrelevant)
After, I am a bit puzzled by miners. I think most don't want the spotlight, and just prefer to do nothing rather than being blamed by part of the community. Which is in my mind good reason, as miners are supposed to not act if they think users reject a proposal.
I think most of the noise come from minority of people with good budget and time. I think it will calm down once they find out Bitcoin does not care about politics.
I am still bullish, Bitcoin has already enough feature for technically serving lots of people. Segwit is a cherry on the top. But I can keep coding without it.
@_date: 2016-03-26 10:43:10
I said a mistake, for old node the transaction is not standard so it will not appear until confirmation, just fixed it.

Interesting, but I tested and there is a bug. You are using OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY. Problem is OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY does not push true on the stack, so the script fail. If you replace by OP_CHECKSIG it works fine.

Given this definition, it seems a synonym of the "use value".
So why do you consider "The payment network" not an  "utility on the function of the object as a medium of exchange".
You can still use the payment network, even if bitcoin has no value as a medium of exchange. (in the case where all the users would convert directly to fiat and never hodl)

I implemented OpenAsset in NBitcoin for its simplicity. The core of the protocol is simple, but also permit custom extensions with the out of blockchain metadata mecanism which can be locked through  [ricardian contracts](
This permit new usage of OpenAsset (like voting tokens I talked in [my book]( without changing and making the core protocol more complicated.
The problem of thin clients is real, but not completely solved with alternatives. (we talked about it with you before killer_storm, and your implementation of colored coin has some benefit, but don't solve the problem completely)
The lack of non-reissuable asset is not a problem in the case of shares (for NASDAQ and NYSE it should not be a problem), but can be for other instruments.
At the end, I think that we might eventually have the two protocols at the same time.
I think the extensible nature and simplicity of Open Asset will increase his adoption, but at the same time, the "flaws" you pointed out can't be worked around and might be critical for some scenario, thus requiring your protocol.
Like I told you, I have not yet read the details of your protocol and worked extensively on OA, but I think it will be implemented sooner or later in NBitcoin as well, for the reasons you enunciated.

They indeed have the right. But if they want to represent anarcho capitalism values, then they should not do it for the sole reason of "Censorship".

This is where we don't agree, censoring is NOT important to anarcho capitalism values.

This was a sudden shock by a one time event, and businesses did not had time to adapt to the new situation.
For fees, there will be no shock, the world won't change during the event "block are full". The price will rise, and some low value services (like satoshi dice, which take lots of space on the blockchain), will be evicted first. There is no "shock of supply", just a slow reduction of it as fast as the increase in popularity, while low value transaction business will be evicted.
The oil shock would be comparable to block size if tomorrow for some reason the block size become 700KB instead of 1MB.

There is nothing pejorative. There will be the current blockchain and the fork of it at the same time. Making 2 differents crypto currency, Bitcoin and XTCoin on 2 different blockchains.
The mining power and innovation will be splitted, as any altcoin.
If XTCoin wins, then it is the death of Bitcoin, if not, it will be an alt coin but nothing to do with Bitcoin.
This is the spirit of the free market of currency in action, but people must understand that this idea is what it is : a new alt coin competing with Bitcoin, and will appear as such in exchanges/wallet providers.
Frankly I doubt the drama will go to this point, and the limit will be lifted anyway. I have not seen strict resistance against lifting it in the mailing list, just some sloppiness to speak about difficult decisions.

This is a misconception thinking LN can run without Bitcoin.
With LN you can indeed never hit the blockchain for a long time, but you need it in case of fraud.
You should see the blockchain as a sort of judge. You don't need him unless a bastard put his hands in your wallet. 
With LN, nodes you are connected to can put their hand in your wallet, but they can't escape the trial, can't corrupt the judge, and on top of that, he is very strict and don't believe bullshit. 
If you steal and try to escape, he will seize not only what you stole, but also everything that the party you stole from sent you in the past. You don't mess up with the judge...

Nobody is betting the farm on LN, if LN is not ready or not used, then blocksize will increase. Segwit is useful for so much purposes that it is really foolish to be "against" it, LN or not.
Both Segwit and LN if implemented are net benefit, and both does not prevent the block size from increasing. They are both a multiplier of how much transaction can fit into a given block.
RBF is unfortunate, this is a feature whose impact is negligible but make all the noise because it is simple to understand. The possibilties provided by segwit are endless, but nobody talk about it because it requires some technical background.

On the contrary Core is the most decentralized decision making as you can get. It takes many dev in the core team to get a single message out.
When some people are annoyed by the core team not expressing "leadership" it is just because very few thing that can be said as a single voice.
The same people who says that core is a centralized team at the same time complain about lack of leadership implied by the decentralisation of the team decision.
You can't get both decentralisation of decision making and strong leadership. You have to take one. Core is the former. And at the same time why it is the more trusted: it takes many ACK and review to get anything done. And yes it implies it is slower. (you can pay dev for reviewing I guess if you want to make it faster and don't have the skill yourself)
That said, you can do your own fork with a strong leadership. (as luke-jr fork for example)
But it can't change the fact that you still need to convince everybody to run it, and you can't force anyone to run it through your "leadership".

All transactions have a cost on bandwidth and storage level, these are multiplied following the number of node. (if there is 100 nodes, sending your tx cost to the world 100 more time than if there was only one node)
Mining is costly as it should be, if it were not Bitcoin would be a fiat and not a comodity. He observed how much electricity was burned for the blockchain now, which is 30kWh (I've not crossed check though). You are right in that if the block size is 2 time as big, then the cost should go to 15kWh.
Now the big question is: why is it that fees are still low given that bandwidth, storage, and electricity cost are higher than the fee of one transaction ? Which I don't know the answer, I would say it is because of the subsidy. (did he discounted it ?)
So without subsidy at current price, the fee of a transaction would be 30kWh, regardless of the limit. (I've not crossed checked his arguments closely though)

No more trust than what you need for using bitcoin normally. You trust miners to not collude against your interests.
The case of a spam attack to prevent you from settling is also costly. And can be mitigated with longer locks.
If your channel destination wants to rip you off, this is not the most effective way.
My point is that if you have a LN transaction that say you have bitcoin, then you have the bitcoin. It is not a promise of debt as, say, you would on an exchange.

Halving coming at 420 000.
Next adjustment at 421 344.
This leaves us 1344 blocks where, if nothing changed, as miner you would earn 12.5 instead of 25BTC.
You would loose 1344*12.5 = 16800BTC (or about 7 million USD in 9 days) by not changing your way of doing.
Let's say that miners refuse to bear the cost, and users bear it fully. (reality will be on the middle)
Pre fork we have around 0.0002BTC per transaction with a block supporting around 3000 tx this would account for around 0.6 BTC per block now.
If users bear the loss of miners, then this need to go up to 12.5 which is a 20x fee bump, or around 2 USD. Bumping to 2MB would make it high to 1 USD. The psychological difference between both especially on short term is not really important. (for all the trade I've done in BTC last year, I would have done them anyway with 2USD)
The best fix for the problem is not bumping the block, but having an emergency patch just in case it goes very bad which fix difficulty for this particular target interval. This would make the fee completely not impacted.
Interestingly, a spam attack would more likely help the situation because they would bear the cost themselves instead of making pay miners or users.

I agree that increasing blocksize limit is unecessary with segwit from the capacity perspective.
Now, if there is wide consensus about 2MB (which I assume is the case for next year), it should still be done, even if no technical need, if it does not really hurt the network. It will need to be done anyway at one point. It would stop this meaningless war. Block size is  boring and distractive compared to what is coming once CSV and segwit is done.

There is one thing to understand, a wealth manager prefer to invest into  junk asset with AAA rating than better one without blessing.
The reason is that if a AAA rated junk asset goes down the toilet, the wealth manager can reject the fault on the rating agency, the economy, or whatever for misleading them.
On the other hand if he recommends Bitcoin and Bitcoin goes down, he will not be able to reject the fault on anyone but himself.
As such lots of wealth manager will not take the risk by themselves, except if their customer are favorable to it.

I prefer version 1 scripts of segwit.
Because when a block explorer wants to index an incoming transaction, when scanning a TxIn, it can infer the scriptPubKey without fetching the previous output. This will save lots of database roundtrip.
That and also the fact that segwit will work out of the box with p2sh supporting wallet.

Segwit (as developed now) is a multiplier. There seems to have mining consensus over 2MB block size, but not yet to 4MB.
Segwit is basically a 1.75 multiplier. So if both pass, you have 3.5MB blocks, to which miners do not agree.
The other problem, is an attack on the size of transaction. The biggest transaction submitted ever (bb41a757f405890fb0f5856228e23b715702d714d59bf2b1feb70d8b2b4e3e08) took 24s to verify for 1MB.
If such transaction is submited now for 2MB, then it takes around 10min to verify. Segwit fix this problem for segwit transactions.
So basically the plan should be deploying segwit, then bumping the size. The reverse would not be dramatic, but more dangerous. I was for 2MB, but segwit changed the equation. Now I am slightly against for two reasons: 1 segwit increases capacity already in safer way, and 2 it gives time to develop ILBT and weak blocks to make 2MB a walk in the park.

But I feel some uncontroversial solution will [be found](
The comparison with central banker is that when you see a controversial decision, it means that some people loose and other win, business who wins and business who looses based on the decision of a small group of individuals possibly connected to these businesses. (What central banking is about)
The community does not need a democracy nor yelling at each other when decisions are uncontroversial, and for that to happen, all controversial argument should be spotted and ignored altogether, even if you believe them to be true.

Then he admits he needs ILBT (so weak block), secp256kr1 and block pruning to decrease propagation time. And who do you think is developping all of that right now? Yes core devs, as explained in the roadmap.


Which solution ? BIP102, yes, I think there is no risk for it and everybody is fine with it, devs included. The question is whether doing it before, while or after the roadmap. Which is bikeshedding.
Especially since the roadmap, if date are respected, will provide the 1.75MB. (wallet provider, and framework provider like myself will update to segwit as soon as it is merged, so it won't take a year)

it depends, for example the transaction on the default page is a P2SH(WSH) which mean that the scriptPubKey is a P2SH payment, but the P2SH redeem is "0 &lt;HASH&gt;". (not shown)
I will add a field to show it.
"0 &lt;HASH&gt;" is a witness payment the hash is compared with the hash of the last push of the witness script. Then this is executed.
WSH payment is similar to P2SH except that you replace "redeem script" with "Witness redeem script" and "ScriptSig" with "WitScript". But if you have a P2SH(WSH) you still need the P2SH redeem pushed on scriptSig

Hey, so microsoft realeased a new version of .NET called ".NET Core" which is open source and run everywhere. It is opposed to ".NET CLR" which is windows only, and "Mono/Xamarin (for mobile devices and linux)".
See them as different fork of .NET. The good thing is that your code can be quite portable accrosss all of those forks. 
But each "fork" has their own tech as well. .NET CLR have ASP.NET MVC and WPF. .NET Core have ASP.NET MVC Core which is slightly different.

Except you can't picture "customers" as a group that homogenously want the same thing.
Saying "Core need to respond to their customer" is dull, as the eco system is so divers that there is no unified requests. The only common unified request is probably "the customers want to be rich with bitcoin", which is not actionable, but for how to get there there is simply no unified agreement among the customers.
So the best devs can do is developping stuff, proposing it to the community and see if it get adopted.

Lightning Network is interesting because you can send a transaction instantly.
Very simply: The principle is that you keep an "ongoing bitcoin transaction" between A and B (also called channel). 
Everytimes A or B sends money to each other you update the transaction. (no broadcast involved)
This is the "Lightning" Part.
With some bitcoin scripting awesomness, if one of the party broadcast an old version of the ongoing transaction, then he takes the risk that the other party see it on the blockchain, and steal all the money.
Note that "sending money from A to B" also happens if A wants to sends money to C through B.
This is the "Network" Part.
I expect LN to be done in 2016, maybe 2017. And 1 year for adoption, so I would expect max 2018.

You should care about the details of the tech. Like I said, there is no compromise to have between round and flat earth proponents for building a satellite, compromise would just lead to crash, pure and simple.
Now, it is clear that Core follow the technically optimal solution and compromise does not belong to technical terminology. Segwit has been done and is an optimal to make a block size increase without breaking stuff.
That said, it does not mean that Core has the last word, I would just prefer seeing a fork of Core trying to maintain a precise compromise that is specific and easy to review, rather than playing politics, by hoping that discussion with representative change things. (Core has no representative, as what unite the contributors is technical soundness)
Look at UASF. UASF is controversial, I am kind of sure it will not make it into Core, but that does not stop people from forking, making a UASF version of Bitcoin and trying to run it without hostility. I would like the same with whatever is the compromise of the day. Just keeping the drama outside of Core. Core delivered a beautiful solution, and a conservative way of deploying a block size increase.

Good point, if mining is financed by tax payer, it will be difficult for private mining companies to compete.

"With adaptable block size miners are winners, full nodes are losers"
"Full nodes" are not an economical agent as long as you don't make money just by running a full node.
Gavin has proven that with the 20MB limit, there seems to be no technical problems with bitcoin core. He would be crystal balling if he says "the network capacity will improve x% every year, thus the limit should do the same".


True, but 'replace-by-fee' does not require a fork, and people are free to use the feature if he considers it is a good idea. The controversy was about including it in bitcoin core. Replace by fee does not forcefully oblige anyone. For this reason, I did not gave any shit about how this debate turned out.


And you consider it is normal that a central group of people decide what "equality of unhappy" means. I don't search for equality of anything, but there are solution where everybody says : oh that's cool, the problem is fixed, and it does not economically damage me, nor protect my competitors from any forseeable condition.

I am writing such code, and it is not the case, it would break all my stuff. Lot's of code use block explorers and libraries to get their stuff done. This assumption of hash calculation is also built into libraries, so any piece of product using a library would be impacted.

That's not an opposition to SW, nor an opposition to SF.
If you refer to 


Logically it'd make more sense to change the way blocks are serialized,
Logically I agree, practically there is tons of unmaintained software running that you use everyday, and doing that will break code through all the industry, including services you may use everyday, as well as introduce bug to untested code suddenly in production. With a 6 Billion industry, you don't want to ignore existing codebase. No, he is not opposed to SF, just saying that logically a new block format would be good, but this is not reasonable if it breaks industry's code. If there is a way to do it without breaking code (and maybe there is) then I'm all for his proposal, but it would be still a SF.

LN or not, segwit or not, the increase will happen. The only thing is when, and my point is that this is a very uninteresting question compared to other things that are going on now.

Because, since witness data is prunable (only needed for verification, not needed for storage), it cost less resource. This is why it is counted at discount.
The base on which fee will be calculated will not be transaction size anymore but "transaction cost", whose formula is : coreSize * 4 + witSize (FIXED)
The reason why fee will be calculated on that is that after segwit the limited resource is "4 MB of block cost", not "1MB block size". (4MB of block cost is equal to a 1MB core size only block)

Actually this is a shame C more multi plateform than other language. You can code with C# and NBitcoin on IOS, Android, Phone, Tablet, Mac or Linux. This is in a sense more portable than Java. But MS suffers from their bad old reputation, so people don't know that.
My book may teach you about bitcoin with very few technical requirement I think, you should give it a try, even if you don't code. I you code and you are not on windows, you can use Xamarin as IDE with the NBitcoin.Mono package, it works like a charm.

Assuming 400 bytes per transaction, you can fit 2500 tx / MB every 10 minute.
Or 360,000 tx / MB / Day.
If people need 1 tx per day, then Bitcoin can service a total of 360,000 persons per MB in the world.
With [LN]( assuming Segwit + OP_CSV pass, you reach 8.3M persons per MB. (bonus: I don't need to assume they need 1tx per day, if they need 10tx, it is still 8.3M persons)
Next, you are assuming that each bitcoin transactions will always be near free without limit. However, how do you finance the storage, bandwidth, and processing power needed to get it processed ? You need to pay all the nodes of the network. Those will never be free. With LN you need to pay only the intermediaries between you and the destination which is smaller cost by order of magnitude.
LN is also real bitcoin, as a merchant accepting bitcoin, will accept your bitcoin from your LN wallet as well, even without knowing about LN.
Conclusion: If you want to use Bitcoin as a payment network, support segwit and CSV help you more to reach you goal, by an order of magnitude. This is on what core is working. So yes, they want bitcoin to become an international payment system.

As a developer, and knowing how much software that all of you use that are basically unmaintained, doing anything that would break such code would create huge disruption in the ecosystem, and send a message that bitcoin is not stable.


The % of nodes adoption have nothing to do with your chance of getting stolen. Either it is activated or it is not.


Not a problem, as all technology the % of adoption will follow a S curve. Right now we did not bumped the limit, and since the limit will increase gradually with time, this is unlikely we will bump again. Seeing how much the industry is implementing segwit the S
If we bump 1.6M this is another problem but not one that will happen in 2017. (that said, I am for the bump in 2017 if there is consensus, which I think there is, even if I maintain that this is useless)
After 2017, I think LN will be available and the norm. Not because of fees, but because it is easier to understand from UX perspective (no confirmation time concept), instant and safer (no double spend risk). This should postbone the next block bump to several years.

I've not listened everything, so I may miss the context, but this is incorrect.
If I send a segwit transaction to you and you have not upgraded, you will see the transaction correctly. (in both SPV and full node wallet)
Because as far as an old node is concerned, the transaction is valid, standard and not segwit. ("Valid and standard" are never verified by SPV wallet though)
EDIT: I am wrong the transaction IS NOT STANDARD for old node (clean stack rule), so for fully validating node you will see the transaction only at first conf.

I am the developer of a library, I can't take assumption of where my code run because it can run in environment that may of may not have OpenSSL, and because of this fact, I need to think and code lot's of code at the library level (or put the burden on the app developer) to probe and use all of those different X.509 libraries (and test them) for a feature almost nobody use. (or us)


They do, but in my library, now I need to code non obvious code to support all of the possible way to parse and validate a x.509 depending on the deps installed on the running system.
However, any language have a proper HttpClient provided by the language/framework developers which does this work for you. This is why you don't get complaints.
Users of HttpClient class does not have to even understand SSL, HTTPS, does not have to deal with managing a trust store and check against it. The burden is not on their shoulder, but on the shoulder of the language or framework designers.

It is possible to use LN with open asset. My main complain is that for LN to be useful, as a network, you need lots of people on it. Since you can only trade one asset on one network (I might be wrong on this part, there might be a way to use same network for several asset though), it mean that networks would be fragmented and pretty much useless.
I might be wrong on one network per asset though, I need to think more about it.
A payment hub can be used for censoring, however few can be gained from hit as it is trivial to create a new one. (minus the reserve problem, reserve can be paid with payment hub fee though)
I don't know about Colu, I'm using Open Asset, it would be possible to improve explorers to calculate the color of an unbroadcasted transaction though. (afaik no one does it yet, but it is possible)
Open Asset is simple enough to implement it by yourself at worse though.

Sorry I've been too aggressive. But it is unreasonable to expect core to work on something they are against. And saying they don't work on 2MB options is simply not true. Segwit is proof of it, BIP102 implementation is already ready if needed, and I suppose those who were at HK wants to propose something for July as well.
Saying they "block" anything is false, as well as saying they don't work for reaching 2MB.
I took it a bit personally myself, even if not core dev, I contributed lots of my free time to segwit (OP_CSV as well) to help scaling. Dismissing those effort is something that make me a bit aggressive sometimes.

Hey, yes as you said, binary is better than protobuff.
Protobuff allow several ways to encode the same piece of data, which got lot's of me headaches.
For PKI, this is a flaw. Because you request the payment request from HTTPS, your OS/curl/http library already do such identity check for your automatically. Having to verify the cert explicitely in the app means adding a dependency some PKI stacks (openssl, windows apis, bouncy castle etc... to parse and verify the cert) for something which should already be checked once you receive the HTTP request on the app.
The application has proof that the payment request is the one belonging to the merchant just by downloading the payment request on the merchant's https website. Granted, if you want to keep the proof for later (for suing), you can't. But no wallet actually keep this proof around for this.
On top of it, very often, payment processor server side do not have (and should not have) access to those certificates. Those certificate should be only used to secure communication, and exposing them to the app is not a good idea as a bug in the app would mean people can start impersonating your business.
The point of embedding the certs was for: 
1. Validating payment and certificate in restrained environment 
2. Decoupling the transport from the identity checks (useful for environment where there is no HTTP/S)
3. Decoupling the signer of the payment request with the one delivering it to the customer (say merchant sign, but bitpay deliver the request)
Practically, there has been no usage of that. And even if there was, on restrained environment maintaining the trust store is a beast on its own.


Yes, that's good.


Yes, that's good.
I would not be against having another protocol, but:
* Without PKI (let's say a merchant could just publicly announce they can sign the receipt with a well known secp256k1 pubkey, it would be enough)
* Pure Binary
I have no interest into keeping BIP70 around. Almost no wallet support it, and it has all those pain points.
Because there is almost no support (even from Bitpay actually), better to just create a brand new one.

With lightning network you are protected by smart contracts (I prefer the term self enforced contract), while on Coinbase you are protected by the justice system. That's the biggest difference.
The implication are deep though. A smart contract enforcement does not depend on what you do with your money, nor which juridiction you are in, and does not cost lawyer to enforce.
The low cost for being protected is what make crypto currencies attractive, and why it started being adopted on black market. The most expensive place to defend yourself is the black market. White market is next.

I just tested one tx using witness and one without (using 3 txinput which is typical)
The "block cost" (the new metric for calculating fee) is 1115 for wit and 2084 for without. So yes, that's around 40% off for normal usage. (formula is coreSize * 3 + witSize)
With wit:
Now, nobody control the price of bitcoin, bitcoin, even without reaching the limit already put out of market poor countries and "coffee buy". (if you buy you coffee with btc you'll pay around 5% to 10% fee)
The reason is that you have to pay the whole ecosystem for using bitcoin : Blockexplorers wants a share, wallets wants a share, exchanges wants a share, miner wants a share. And they want a share because their service cost them. The cost of their service depends directly on the bandwidth, and utxo size.
Now, introduce LN. Suddenly, miners, exchanges etc... stop being asking their share because your transaction will never stay forever in the shared ledger, it cost them nothing. So LN will ALWAYS be cheapr than on chain transaction only for the fact that storing and transacting through it waste less resources. (the bandwidth and storage you consume with LN is limited to your machine, and do not use space on any other nodes)
Even now, with LN you would profit from instant transaction and be able to buy your coffee profitably. But if you use LN you'll need to pay the establishement of your channel with a btc transaction... which will profit even more from segwit.
TL;DR Bitcoin (on chain) transaction, limit or no limit will cost you a lot if it goes big, because it consumes resources. The only solution to this problem is LN.

There is one library now that properly abstract this and use the trust store of the platform your code is running on.
.NET is the only one doing this, other language either require:
1. To probe the different libraries in your code and use the one that is installed on the OS
2.  Rely on curl. (which mean you need to build/ship as a dependency on all place where you distribute your app)


Easy: This is easy, a public, well known public key and you just sign the bytes of the invoice. No need of certificate and trust store.

My main point is that if you want an easy to use wallet:
* Use somebody's else Electrum Server
* Use a wallet relying on a centralized block explorer
But DO NOT rely on the most PoW, as it gives leverage to miners.
The only point where Neutrino is cool is for people who wants to have their own full node and don't want to have to install middleware like Electrum server. 
Neutrino is NOT cool for user experience, nor for the long term of bitcoin if everybody use it while following PoW.
Neutrino is NOT an improvement over trusting a block explorer or a random Electrum Server, it is a step backward which build long term risk to Bitcoin. Even in term of usability, trusting a block explorer is better.
I think calling Neutrino awful is a bit of an exaggeration by myself. It is better than BIP37. But it should not be promoted as "user friendly" or "better than trusting a block explorer".

And how do you explain 
Do you know the placebo effect ? this is exactly what is happening to you. I want to try hard to think that you are not raising drama on purpose, but yes you are really not helping.
If the wallet you are using give you problem, then I suggest you tell us which one you are using and that you help devs like me to contact the company behind it to offer them free advise on how to solve their bug.
Or maybe the problem is not at all a bug, but a poor UX of the wallet you use which confuse users.

Yes, it is possible with OP_CLTV.
You can make a scriptPubKey like. (with a deadline before OP_CLTV instead of 0)
But this is not the way I would do it, because such kind of transaction is not really usable with today's tool (except if you are a dev), I would prefer a simpler nLockTime locked transaction until the deadline sending money to the addresses of beneficiaries directly. If I die, they would have to wait the deadline and just broadcast it.
I would also consider just giving my BIP39 seed to my family in a shamir's secret, without any transaction.

There should be no code dealing with it. Even adding OpenSSL dependency just for this is unacceptable burden. How do you keep up to date the trust store? Should you use the trust store of OpenSSL, the one of the native OS, or the one at the browser level? Those depends on where your code is running and you need to handle that so that it does give unneeded github issues. But in any languages, if your use a proper HTTPClient, they use the OS level trust store, as it should, with the proper binding which work everywhere.

I agree. But those users who follows the reference implementation are integral part of the market. It is not fair to exclude them, and declare "they are not part of the market". It is a "no true scotman" fallacy.
If there really had problems that core did not address but that a competing implementation would, then those users would switch. 
Currently, competing implementations do not address a need important enough for those users to switch.

Basically, I create two bitcoind node on regtest and connect them together by calling RPC method addnode.
Then I generate blocks with NBitcoin and broadcast them via [BIP 152]( messages. (with low bandwidth and high bandwidth mode)
I also check if the bitcoind node broadcast me blocks with cmpct blocks. 
Actually [the code of my test]( is self describing when you have [BIP152 diagram]( on the side, and that you understand that "bitcoind" and "bitcoind2" represent actual bitcoind nodes.
For testing collision, I changed the shortid from 48 bit to 1 bit. Generated lots of blocks with lots of transaction and checked manually that "bitcoind" and "bitcoind2" stayed correctly sync.
I implemented compact block encoding in NBitcoin based on the C++ source code, so I indirectly tested it well as well.

My personal feeling: (I was not in the "HK agreement")
* Capacity does not impact bitcoin reliability,
* Raising capacity is an important goal, several improvement after segwit like schnorr sig and MAST will raise capacity more than current 2MB HF with minimal waves and disagreement, without raising any size, (it is optimisation)
* If there is controversy for 2MB HF, it should not be merged in Core, a HF is up to the community, not devs,
* I'm in favor of 2MB HF, but I'm against to do it now as it is far from clear that the community really want that,
* If there is a HF proposition by those in the HK Meeting, I'm very interested about propositions outside 2MB HF. I think a non controversial HF is possible, even if it is not the 2MB one.
I'm confident that in the future a capacity increase which require HF can be done in a non controversial way. I don't know how (2MB HF or something we don't know yet) nor when. I'm confident that we are not in a crisis, and that future is brighter than ever.
HF propositions are still interesting to follow, whether or not it is about capacity increase.
Last thing: everytime you say "core devs agreed on...", it should be understood as "some devs which code on core agreed on...". There is such diversity in contributors that it is rather rare that core as a whole agree on something, but it happens time to time. (like CSV and Segwit)

Good luck, bitcoin is designed against that.


There is no deadlock, and no conflict.
You seem to think there is two camps represented by BU and Core. And that if somehow Core agrees with BU by negociation, then things can move.
This is not how bitcoin work, both group are not representative of anyone. Bitcoin is not a representative democracy. You need to convince users, services and miners, individually, there is no leader. 
Now, LN is possible even without segwit, in somewhat more risky way (impossible to outsource channel monitoring), but still perfectly acceptable for coffee transaction.

I think it will eventually, but taking more time than expected. Meanwhile nothing is blocking LN, even if we do not have Segwit.

There is the core roadmap with rough date, which only tell you when it is expected the proposition get merged into Core.
When and whether bitcoin will accept those changes is another matter and nobody can tell you want because the decision is not centralized.
I am sure the proposals made by core will pass and will profit bitcoin. If what bother him is the uncertainty that this is true, then I'll profit by buying cheaper coin. (valued cheaper because of his uncertainity that will be lifted when the improvements will be effective in bitcoin)

From the conceptual level, segwit is not different from P2SH. You basically need TxOut + RedeemScript + Private Key to sign. The rest is plumbing.
If you are using a good framework like NBitcoin, NBitcoin can figure out by itself if the redeemScript is a P2WSH or a P2SH.

This effectively mean as if you successfully made a p2sh solution, making a segwit working one does not involve any change to backend.

Bitcoin is not rocket science, but it depends on which level you code. Higher level stuff is easier (like service or product based on bitcoin). 
Bitcoin Core dev is easy to read, BUT, a mistake in it has way higher impact than any software (particulary at the consensus layer). It is of full of far from obvious trap. A minefield. Which mean that changes need more review than typical software.

For making it widly more interesting, still needed are:
* Mempool implementation
* Efficient block storage for non pruned mode
* Wallet features.

Bad actors try to create a split. This is the most efficient way to lower bitcoin because of network effect.
Every person trying decrease the difficulty by lowering the amount of consensus needed to make a split is highly suspicious to me. (I am in favor of Segwit, but would strictly oppose any change of threshold)
If it does not get accepted, alternate solutions which might be more painful for users will be adopted.
I highly doubt a competing currency could take users, as the liquidity of others currency is order of magnitude lower and would not offset the pain.
Lightning without segwit only mean users need a way to monitor the blockchain by themselves time to time. It is not really a big deal. And if segwit does not pass, I don't think any other solution solving malleability could pass. (as segwit is the simplest way to achieve malleability fix)

Not at all, hosts do it all. They try to maximize occupancy, so once his room becomes spare he will go back promptly to Airbnb.
It is rather rare that you become friend enough with your host to cut out the middleman. It takes time, and a stay of 1-3 weeks is not enough.
Basically, for short stay Airbnb can't be bypassed. For middle stay, you can sort of develop relationship with your host and bypass them. For long stay, you find proper rent contract. (in some country, it might be very complicated though, next to impossible for digital nomad)
It is Airbnb goals to find a proper business model so that they are profitable. And they are doing well, simply because they solve the problem of trust in short term stays. There is always a huge need for short term stays.

Making a new node implementation is a journey. You don't have legacy, you are more flexible, you allow more dev to contribute as tech barrier is lower. But on the other hand, you don't have as much as expert review and testing and field feedback than an old one like Bitcoin core. 
All node starts small, and this one will. Hoping it reach as popular as core, but won't happen overnight.
Making a good interface for core is very hard due to the tech it uses, and slow process of reviewing (which always happen for mature enough projects) It is in a sense easier to build from scratch.

Development community is huge. Most companies have often a team with specific development skills working on a project.
You can't ask to these developers to compile any C++ code, or run some obscure python script to do their job for various reason. (cost of training, and deployment headaches)
To propagate bitcoin into such a group, you need to have Bitcoin library in their own native language.
Take an example Unity. If you want to do a cross platform games, it is by far the leader today. So lots of game dev team develop solely on Unity and can't use any other language with their game without massive compatibility issue.
You can't expect them also to create the lib themselves, as they prefer focusing on the game.
Now come NBitcoin, where they can finally use Bitcoin in their game.
TL;DR; Having bitcoin accessible in several language allow Bitcoin to reach outside communities.

Money is the root of collaboration with strangers. Without money,   people would live in tribes, constantly fighting with other tribes.
Money make it possible for division of labor to cross tribes, it is the only thing that make us collaborate rather than kill and steal strangers. Corrupting money through inflation push people to tribalism. And having alternatives push them to collaboration, the structure of our society reflect the balance of these two forces.
Less philosophical, before Bitcoin, I was never complaining about my card being blocked for whatever reason. Not complaining about 5 percent fees at ATM in foreign country, not complaining of questions to answer when I was receiving money. I thought it was how things were and that we could do nothing about it.
Since Bitcoin, I took notice of all the bullshit and started to opt out. I managed to live for a year without my bank account, and it gave me tremendous confidence about the future. Bitcoin influenced me deeply personally and professionally.

While you can do this, I highly discourage it. When you use Electrum (without EPS), you basically gives all your addresses to ChainAnalysis.
Instead you can use Ledger Nano S with the local BTCPay wallet interface, or, if you are ok with bech32, you can also use Wasabi Wallet to send from your ledger. In this case, all your addresses never get leaked to untrusted parties.

I think it is a good point actually. But let's be clear, the day one satoshi is worth one US penny, I will not care anymore. :D
But assuming it does, I don't think adding a decimal would be a controversial change since it cheats nobody because all the market would be impacted at the same time. Increasing the reward, on the other hand, transfer wealth from holder to miners. (Money creation benefit the first receiver at the expense of late receiver)
But I think that even a "forever 50BTC" would not solve the issue. If 0.1% of coin is lost per year, then when 1 year worth of reward reach less than 0.1% of total existing coins, we'll start to see satoshi decrease.

My point is that customer's of mining pool are the one who decides. Imagine two pool A and B. B try to behave in a way who provably maximize miner outcome all being equals, but impact usage.
In reality, nothing stay "all being equals". People would stop paying mining power to B and buy to A, or pay for competitor, which would punish B from misbehaving.
By removing the vote you does not resolve the question at all. Miners will need to decide whether our not they accept a block anyway. They can still decide to go for small block anyway to maximize profit. I think that both way will endup eventually to the same soft limit, except that BIP100 does it in a way which would limit attacks. (ie : "would I waste time checking this 32MB block, when all the previous one were 1MB ?")

I only said that bigger blocks push to centralization more than smaller blocks, the evolution of storage and bandwidth is orthogonal to this observation. My point is that BIP100 does not give power to miners more than 101.


Decentralization of node is not so important, mining is the big deal.
But even with it, the argument does not hold. Imagine 10% of people are running nodes.
And imagine that 15% increase in block increase bring 15% more people. You can't expect 10% of those 15% (or 1.5%) to run a node, since the minimum specification will be higher than before the 15% increase. So you will likely get something less than 1.5%. If so is the case, it is easy to demonstrate that the % of people running the node will tend to 0 eventually. And this is assuming that no node which existed before the increase get shut down because of minimum specification raising.

They are like babies who just discovered swimming pool and are only dipping their toes into it.
Swimming seems interesting, but the water is scary and cold, so for now, let's only walk where we know.
When their body will get accustomed to the temperature I think they will swim in the bitcoin blockchain as adults do.
I don't think we should worry about it. Frankly, they are very into this "private blockchain" stuff, as a technical person I can see the absurdity into the statement, but for them it makes perfect sense... so why not ? What I think will happen is that they will invest lots of money into that, then finding they get no advantage over a traditional database since nobody wants to join the blockchain controlled by another group.
Then they will ask to interoperate with the bitcoin blockchain instead so they can fix the trust problem they have with other people's blockchain, and eventually, drop their legacy private blockchain altogether. 
In any case, meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry will get some money pumped into and progress a bit, and on their side, they will finally understand the meaning of trustless and what make "THE Blockchain" interesting.

No, Neutrino does not preserve the same level of trustlessness than a full node. 
Full node validate everything, Neutrino trusts somebody else to do the work.
For a server, there is no need (aside from the IBD -initial block download-) to run Neutrino.

I am not following XT dev, my point is that it is fine to discuss what it implements (if there is no BIP then what are they implementing btw ?), but it is not fine to discuss about XT on Bitcoin.
If Litecoin does an interesting thing in their crypto, then it is certainly worthwhile to discuss what they are doing here, but it does should not become a reddit for Litecoin.


You are right, but my point is that until this hard fork really happen, then the current minority should not be considered "Bitcoin". If the hardfork happens, and the "core branch" disappear in oblivion or barely survive, then the situation change, and talking about XT here will be possible. (And maybe about core banned if they don't follow the majority hard fork)

I see your point, but I don't think mentioning it in BIP100 will make it harder to change.

If this is the verified reason people say "BIP100 gives power to miner", I would agree with you. (and maybe it is, we don't have the implementation yet)

I don't think so, I think that it is not bitcoin when from the time it breaks consensus. (even on future date)


That's a good argument actually : What makes "Bitcoin core with a hardfork planned" different from "Bitcoin XT" ?
I would say the difference is that Bitcoin core is still the one followed by the majority. And if Bitcoin XT reverse the situation, then the situation wil be reverse in favor of Bitcoin XT. (I agree that this is not a strong argument though)
I think in fact that hardfork should be voted by miners before being planned at all. 
But only in a way where : 
* You can vote for several BIPs at the same time 
* where they are not mutually exclusive. (if a vote succeed, the vote of other bip continue)
I talked about it here 
Let me know what you think, 
It would solve the question of "why bitcoin core with hardfork is different than bitcoin xt ?" nicely. No hardfork would be planned except if 95% vote. (which is very possible if one miner can appove several BIP)
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:41:08
I don't really understand the point of his criticism. I think it is a more peaceful way to resolve the situation and more precise metric than "gauging interest" that is susceptible to sybil. (I can create 1000 nodes in a push of a button with Bitcoin XT... but I can't cast a vote easily on a mined block)
People would not even agree what is needed to be gauged at all. When block mining vote is clear and simple.

So if you have 2048 different words and you should pick one of them, your entropy is 11. (2^11 = 2048)
If you need to choose 2 times one word among 2048 possibilities you have 2048 * 2048 possibilities or 22 of entropy (2^22 = 2048*2048)
And so on...

The problem is that, if the talk about XT is not blocked, then we have two differents crypto currencies both calling themselves "Bitcoin" but not interoperable. 
If Mercedes was relabeled Honda and you bring your car to a Honda repair man, he will tell you : I can't fix your Honda. This is the root of the problem. If we can talk about Bitcoin XT, then why not Litecoin as well ?
Now, if BitcoinXT wins over Bitcoin core, we don't have the problem anymore since Bitcoin core old rules will not exist anymore, Bitcoin XT will be able to call itself "Bitcoin" without ambiguity. 
But until there is ambiguity, we should not mix both cryptos with the same words.

Why picking a sole "Winner" ? It put us in a situation where Miner A and miner B might want both BIP says "Kick in the can" one, AND BIP 100, but since they vote for different one, no BIP would reach 95%.
Put the three of the BIP together, allow several vote, which ever reach 95% will be hard forked planned.
When the second one also get 95%, make a second hard fork.
Yes it will make lots of fork, but if miners don't want forks, they just have to abstain from voting.

How so ? Did not know that other crypto had 436,932,099.09 GH/s behind them. Also, lot's of crypto are not copycat and have different properties which fit different requirements.


Did not know getting 51% of hashing power was cost effective. Heard all the noise about bitcoin XT ? They managed to get 0.6% of hash power. Whooho.


What do you mean by "not scarce" ? if it were not its market value would be 0 as the air you breath. 
Do you mean that if I needed to pay a television in iron, I would need 100KG of iron in my pocket and that would be inconvenient compared to 1 gold coin ? Granted. Cryptos not concerned about volume and weight.


So Iron has more intrinsic value than Gold since it has more usage, it makes a great store of value isn'it ? Less inconveniant to store and protect maybe, but this again, crypo not concerned about weight.
I know your arguments are the classical Schiff's one, a crypto seems to violate non regression principle since it acquiered non monetary value only after being used as a medium of exchange. But with 436,932,099.09 GH/s behind it, it has found its use value.

Theymos has the right behavior. However, IF it finally Bitcoin XT succeed, and IF we still call it "Bitcoin", then obviously he will switch. (as the owners of bitcoin.org said they would)
But this is two big IF. Meanwhile, it should be considered an alt.
So if, let's say, I do Bitcoin ND (like Bitcoin Nicolas Dorier) which does not follow the rule of Bitcoin, should we talk about it here ? I don't think so. If my rules are adopted not just in mining power, but also all providers, and merchants are using my Bitcoin ND, then it might effectively because Bitcoin at this point. But until there it should not be and I should be considered an alt coin.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:34:36


I think you don't understand what I mean.
Imagine that a miner A is for BIP 100, but tolerate BIP 102.
Miner B is for BIP 101 but tolerate BIP 102 as well.
Currently the situation is that Miner A and Miner B are yelling at each other for 100 versus 101. Since they currently only cast one vote, Miner A will vote 100 and miner B will vote 101.
However, if they both can vote for their favorite AND 102, then a consensus might be reached on 102.
My proposition would not be an activation switch as what happened for BIP66. 
But if 95% vote for BIP102 is reached, then Bitcoin core dev team can push the update to activate at some agreed deadline. The switch won't be automatical, bitcoin core devs will do it manually by knowing that BIP102 in such case is not controversial. (thanks to the 95% vote)
Core devs will just check BIP proposal are correctly explained and have a valid PR.
Miners will vote all what they approve.
Users will be able to indirectly vote by buying share to the mining pool that support his idea.
Also no hardfork would be pushed until there is provably effectively 95% miners who approves.

the proof of work of mining pool is derived from the resource they get from their customer. (Mining share)
Thus, if as a customer, you buy mining share (not meaning company share), you can influence the vote. This is what slush proposed with BIP101 and I think it is a cool idea to boost profit for mining pools
It gives a way for people to vote wih their wallet.

I think you should reply to them bullshit. They don't care about the real reason, the only thing they care is that regulator don't harass them.
If they ask you receipt for your mining operation, try to get a receipt of a restaurant written in chinese, they will not waste time checking it.
For the description of future activities, try to look for a trading strategy somewhere on internet, replace words with "Bitcoin" instead. And make it long and boring and complex. With bureaucracy, I learnt that the form is more important than the content.
Example of bullshit that make no sense, but will pass: "My strategy is to get profit from the upcoming dead bounce cat pattern that should come up next more, then withdraw in LTC for cost averaging my losses. So you can expect fiat withdrawl every 3 week of the month, if all goes well. BUT if it is a clown in the river pattern, then maybe I'll cost average dollar by buying in high frequence pattern... etc and etc." Make it long and boring.
For the high number of user they need to check, I would say people who looks at that are not skillfull worker, so the bar to be credible should be pretty low.
Imagine yourself as reading a Zerohedge article, all seems interesting, but since your time is limited you read the bold sentences.

Mining contracts can be accountable by the customers.
You compare how much GH you are paying, how much your mining pool has, and compare the profits. The higher the divergence, the higher you know your pool is scamming.


Why is so ? As I explained no voting like 101 basically give more power to miners, not less.

This is the point I do not understand. If for example you don't agree with miner A and B, but miner C agrees with you. You can still buy shares to this miner to boost his voting power.
If A and B are overwhelmingly bad, I expect their mining power will reduce OR that miner C voting power will increase.
Mining would not be a speculation tool anymore, but also a way to vote with money.
Sure some miners will want just to optimize their returns, but other will just want to vote.


Yes, I would better say human in general and not only engineers. But approval voting would exactly prevent bad behavior based on bad prediction of some individuals.

Precisely. As Mises pointed out, the problem is not really the inflation or deflation rate not even the unpredictability of it. The market would adapt to conditions in contracts. (by favoring short term versus long term, and changing rates of loans)
Only arbitrary change in monetary policies has the ability to give a man the tool to confiscate wealth.
So like you, I believe that picking 50 forever would not have changed anything, but now we signed against it, it should not change because it would ultimately give a way to someone to confiscate wealth. (even without any intention to do so)
An example is the disaster provoked by the SNB beginning of this year. They wanted to peg euro to chf to favor exporters, so exporters relied on this information. If SNB would not have been tempted to peg in the first place, exporters would not have relied on flaky promise and would have been better adapted to the fluctuation of the market. The issue is not fluctuation per see but arbitratry change of monetary policy.

While wallet providers increase fees to have 1 block confirmation and find out it takes 3 blocks instead, it will reevaluate fees up, and the less valuable usage of bitcoin will eventually get out. There will be no unreliability matter, except if, as I said, there is unexpected peak.


Well, this might be improvement, (and actually the network already has a reject message for this kind of usage) but it is not perfect, since transaction in mempool might eventually get evicted later.
Users will not be driven out by unreliability but by the fees. I agree there is some improvement (maybe sending reject message if the transaction did not get into the mempool), or even improving the block size. But this is hardly a technical problem that urgently need to be fixed which can cause bitcoin to implode.

Who is Bitcoin ? Who does not have the obligation ?
I think satoshi once said (sorry can't find back the source) that we should use the blockchain for whatever we want. And I believe no person should decide which usage is right or not. Let the free market decides about that.
Now, if there is technical reasons to protect Bitcoin, then we can talk about it. But there are better way of preventing spam than raising the minimal value. One of which is to take into account the number of TxOut opened minus the one spent for the calculation of relay fees. Why would you want to hurt a potential huge use case of the blockchain just because it was not created for this purpose at first ?
It is like the start of internet, we used phone line that was meant for... giving phone call, and just found a new usage. Now it is the reverse, we make phone call on internet.

Imagine that deflation explodes, and suddenly your 1000 USD is suddenly worth 10 million USD of goods. What would you do do ?
1. Stop spending anything and get back to work as always ?
2. Make a trip around the world in luxurious hotels, buy a car and a house and a greek island,
Now another question :
Say you have 1000 USD and inflation make them worth 10 USD of good, what would you do ?
1. Stop spending anything and get back to work as always ?
2. Make a trip around the world in luxurious hotels, buy a car and a house and a greek island,
Well, interestingly enough, for mainstream economists the response is 1 and 2. While I can bet that you responded 2 and 1.
But actually, a money who is predictively deflationary or inflationary has no real impact, only a change of policy has impact. If the money is predictively inflationary, then contract will emerge so the lender protect himself against it.
And if money is predictively deflationary, then the loaner will protect against it as well.
The only problem with a predictively inflationary currency is that it pushes your saving into more risky investments, when you just want to save money. (either for starting a business or buying a greek islen)
What hurts is any unexpected change of monetary policy. (like what happened with the SNB)
And when a few control them, they can kill whoever they want with this power.
That being said, some people will say : you are taking extreme position, USD can't have an increase x1000. Yes, but this is only a tool to understand the direction of what will happen if you go one way or the other.
You can also imagine, how would you behave if you know that your money, predictively rise 100% every year ? What will you do the first year ? and in 2 year ? will you really stop to consume and work everyday as before until you die, or will you finally buy a greek island and make your company ? what would happen at 50%,10%,5% ?
What if you know that your money DECREASE by 100% every year ? You may spend everything today, what about in one year ? and in 2 year ? What if the decrease of value is 10%, 5%, 2% ?
If you don't have anything to spend on, do you consider speculating in stocks with your money improve the economy ?

I think the best technical way is just observing unconfirmed transactions and when they get confirmed. Sample (FeePerKB; WaitingTimeInBlocks), then make a model to predict the unknow variable WaitingTimeInBlocks from FeePerKB variable... as far as I know it is what estimatefee in rpc is doing, and more or less how blockcypher do it. (
This takes less assumption than calculating transaction priority and is easier to implement. But I think core devs wants to penalize opening too much UTXO, if that's the case, then transaction priority way might be better.

I see, I don't think it is a good idea because the "15% average" might not be true. It might be more or it can be less, and it can fluctuate, but in any case we would be stuck with the decision. What if it don't go up ? we get the network more and more centralized. Whit if it goes up too quickly ? then we are limiting block size unecessarily.
Any justification based on a prediction model is fragile and should be discarded. (I would say except if it is short term, since the prediction have more chance to hold in short term)
That said, I don't have any response. Except that I would like either a short term response based on prediction or a longer term response who does not depends on our projection of the future.

it's not how bitcoin works. Bitcoin works by paying the size of the Transaction. (which consume real scarce resources)
Why do you think my small output of 250$ should pay more fees than the output of 1 BTC, when both consume as much resources ?
If you make fees paid by the volume moved, then you also impose restriction on people that just want to move bitcoin into coinjoin scheme to protect their privacy for example. It is why fees are based on byte size and not value.

Only rising the block size will NOT solve the problem. It makes the attack X many times more expensive, but still cheap enough for individual attackers.
Rising fees and better fees selection algorithm solves the problem dynamically. If we get 10 times more spam, then fees will just go up. When spam is out of fuel, then fees will go back down.
Also, nobody is against rising the block limit, but better fee policy is a way better defense against spamming than raising the block limit. One does not exclude the other though.
But you are naive into thinking that rising the size will make the problem go away : we don't know how deep are the pocket of the spammer. Meanwhile, I can assure you that with better fees policies that are into development and will be widly deployed next week, the problem will go away, and fees eventually come back where it was before.

The user will then get pissed of by the wallet provider which did not used adequate fees. The wallet provider will then make smarter fee calculation. (and this is what we actually saw happening)
The problem will then disappear and be business as usual. Human are adaptive creatures compared to software, and I find that the ecosystem reacted greatly so far. Not every fix have to be made in code in the consensus.

This is why I said "decentralized". Increasing the block size per 20, does not solve the problem. We don't know how deep the pocket of the spammer are, spamming the blockchain is dirt cheap.
However, with better fee policies we are sure that the spammer will get irrelevant. I'm not against block size increase, but it will not make this particular problem goes away.
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:56:00
I understand, but as I said, if the tx rate is predictable, it means fees also are. As fees increase, people will be driven out of Bitcoin to alternatives, and we'll reach an equilibrium where legit transactions cleared at the rate dictated by the block limit.
What alternative ? we don't know. Maybe centralized one (coinbase out of chain), maybe alt coin, maybe micro payment.
But it should be noted that not everyone will leave Bitcoin, because if they do, then it would decrease fees and make onchain transactions interesting again.
With the spam, we saw no technical problem, and also not so much unreliability problem, even if the peak was unpredictable. This is good news.

You can deal with 2 types of person :
-The religious Keynesian. Do not waste your time convincing him.
-The one genuinely misinformed, 
In this case, I think the best way to convince is to ask them why they think it is a scam. 
If they tell you "look at MT Gox", tell them that they did not blamed the euro during the Cyprus bailin.
If they tell you it is used for laundery and terrorist, tell them they did not blamed the USD when HSBC bankers laundered money for Mexican cartels.
If they tell you that lots of scam exists, ask them if they blamed the euro for Bernard Madoff's Ponzi.
If they tell you that the first believers got rich, and the new users are paying for the old one, ask them in what point it is different from any company's share they bought on the public market in their portfolio.
If they tell you it is not real money, ask them what is money.
You should not find any strict opposition, except from "religious Keynesians", clearing the misunderstanding should be very easy.

Yes, but are you really thinking that wallet providers will not take steps for : 1 improving the fee algorithm and 2 resubmitting the transaction, which will fix the problem all together ? (In fact, this is what happened)
Yes, they will most likely wait the last moment to do it, because their time is limited, but they do it as soon as their user start getting problems.
Wallet software are not set in stone, software is easy to change and adapt to new condition. Yes some consumer will get pissed of because they made the transaction when the wallet was not ready to handle it... so what ? The next time the wallet will be ready and life goes on.
Bitcoin worked as expected with the inefficiency implied by a decentralized system. There is nothing to do, "it worked as seen on TV", all the ecosystem adapted to the new environment as it should have done, without any central planning needed.

Bitcoin blockchain is used for more application than the Bitcoin payment system, and I think it will be used more and more outside of its initial area. What you are asking with your question is : Why is colored coin a more important usage of the blockchain than the payment system ?
This, I have no answer and nobody should have any,what I can say is that all those usage are ready to pay the fees needed for their applications.
Free market for this scarse resource (blockchain space) will by itself tell which usage is more important than the other.
Moreover TxOut spamming already cost fee/kb which prevent spamming. If the worry is a big UTXO set fired by 0 satoshi TxOut, then find a way to calculate min fees, not on the transaction size. But on the TxSize + TxOut count, this would not penalize colored coins at all, while solving the problem without any need for min value of TxOut.

"Bitcoin is easier" depends on what you intend to do with it, and thus depends on the unique background of the person you are talking to.
If they need sending money to their family aboard, it is easier.
If they travel, it is easier. (you have a none zero chance to not be able to withdraw for whatever reason in another country)
If they do something legal but suppressed by the moral army (backpage), it is easier.
If you pay and get paid from multiple countries, it is easier.
But for the case of the average person, it is NOT easier as long as they do not use Bitcoin for both : spending and getting paid.

You are right. But if nobody produce, where will you buy your fishing rod ? Where will you buy your food ? If no one produce, then the price of goods will goes up (because quantity decrease will the need is always the same), even if your money is deflationary.
How much will they rise ? Well, if everybody is having the same 1000% increase every year, they will not accept anything less than 1000% increase of the price of good every year, else they will prefer leisure, as you do.
This is why I said : when deflation or inflation can be predicted, it does not have any real impact on the economy.
I don't think deflation or inflation is necessarily a bad or good things. People adapts to the circumstances when they are predictable.

btw, do you have any old discussion about the need of 600 satoshi limit of txout value ? I think it was to prevent satoshidice to spam the network. However, what I don't understand is that the current fee policy of charging Fees/KB would automatically prevent spamming attack once the blocks are full.
I sincerely don't think that such spamming rule is necessary once services have smarter fees algorithm. (which we should see very soon thanks to the spam attack)

* Only payment processor using it is Bitpay
* Bitpay itself broke compatibility with BIP70 with custom changes (NBitcoin BIP70 parser was not working anymore)
* BIP70 itself is completely bogus proposal which involve dependency to protobuf and PKI
The JSON based standard (better than BIP70 IMHO) bitpay is using now is not documented so I don't use it, their behavior in the past mean they will probably break compatibility unilaterally again. I have no intention on supporting a "standard" that only one payment processor use and even less one that will break.

when someone "own something" it means that he has power to do what he wants with the thing he owns.
"Ownership of the private key" means that you can "dispose of the private key however you want".
"Ownership of Bitcoin" means that you "dispose of the coins however you want".
These are two different concepts. You may not owning the private key, but still owning Bitcoin. Imagine that the private key is encoded in a tamper proof quantum hardware device which delete the key if someone looks at it.
In this case, you do not own the private key. Granted, you own the device, but not the private key.
Then imagine that in the future each person get transplanted such device in their body when they are born and can't withdraw it without killing themselves. In such case, they don't own the device, they don't own the private key, but they still own the coins.

2. Invest it with the high risk of getting back less than 1000000%.
I would wait 1 year and then buy a greek island and start a company. And I would not invest in another person company. (as you rightfully guess)
My point is, your postulat is "My goal is to increase my return".
But would you really make "increase my return" your most valuable goal, rather that making your own company, and buying a greek island when you are earning 1000% predictively every year ?

You are mostly right, but what I am pointing out is that tomorrow they will feel that the dollar bill (or their bank's IOU) are flawed and it won't be a conspiracy anymore. Day by day it is becomes more difficult to spend your money as you want and I don't see the trend slowing.
At this point, they will turn out to you, Bitcoin wizard, not because they benefit for a 10% coupon, but simply because they want to spend money and the system makes it near impossible to do so. 
It will be too late for them, since they will be already mostly cooked. But they will suddenly learn, and then, with people having new eyes Bitcoin will bloom better than ever. I think this can't be prevented since the regulators are so eager to regulate what people can do with their money.
Thus my advice : no need to waste time on skeptics, they will eventually come.

That said, I admit not having used any of them yet. (I've read the spec and the JS API of the Ledger because we will need to interact with it in C

So you are saying that a dust coin representing 10K USD is worth less than a coin representing say 10 BTC ? That the 10K USD should be considered spam while the 10 BTC should not be ?
Colored transactions are not creating more outputs than regular transactions. The only thing that change is the value of them in BTC, which has no impact on the UTXO set size.
And yes, nullc is right, if we could, we would use 0 value txout. But what should be prevented is not small outputs, it is having UTXO set size growing too much. But you should note that current feesPerKB already does just that, and it is why the sky did not fall even with a 50K mempool. (frankly, I would not have bet that before seeing it for real)

Yes, Miners have been pushed to believe 2MB kick the can was ok. I think it is not wrong to suppose that for next year. The problem is that the rule are changed when gavin decided 75% and 4 weeks, this, only a minority support.
BitPay, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Shapeshift signed for block increase, but they did not signed for 75%, 4 weeks. This was announced AFTER they announced their support. This is a nasty trick to say they agree with Classic as it is now only because they said ok for 2MB. This is a big manipulation.
I think what will happen is 2MB is activated, a big part of the community will say "we don't upgrade", and it will be a monumental disaster with bitcoin crashing as people become uncertain what will happen in the few weeks.
Hell, even Antpool who announced support for Classic did not know about the attempt 75% and 4 weeks and are not fine with it:

@_date: 2016-02-13 00:52:43
OP_CLTV = I block my coin until X (where X is block height or actual date)
OP_CSV is called Relative lock time.
OP_CSV = I block my coin for X period after being mined (where X is a number of block or a timespan)
This makes bi directional payment channel way more easy as less costly. If only CLTV existed a payment channel would need an expiration date, the choice of the expiration date was tricky as you needed to balance convenience (long expiration) with downside in case of preemptive closing of the channel. (one party would need to wait until the end of expiration to get his coins) 
With OP_CSV a payment channel can be opened indefinitely. One of the two party still need to wait to get back money if they close the channel, but this is a constant, reasonable period like one day.

If they did it would be a bitcoin wallet, not a bitcoin account and my point would not be a problem as your private key would be able to redeem on both chain. But Coinbase is not about entrusting a private key, it is about trusting an IOU.

Now if you have a bitcoin wallet, you have both NicoCoin and Bitcoin. If you have Coinbase account, you have only Bitcoin.

There is a big misconception that bitcoin is an efficient medium for transferring fiat. This is not, except if government put sufficient restriction on fiat transfer to offset the ease of use of Paypal.
Bitcoin is efficient at transferring Bitcoin.
Now for transferring bitcoin, the concept of "Unconfirmed transaction" is not very user friendly, but I'm not sure in practice to many people notice it. With LN though, the concept of Unconfirmed Transaction will simply disappear.
People should not see Bitcoin as a fancy way for transmitting fiat. They must see Bitcoin as money itself for understanding the advantage. And this is not a usability problem but a cultural one.

No, the user has the right to refuse it, even if it makes no economical sense. Whether he gives up his permission to another entity is his choice, and should be explicit in term of contract.
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:27:16
By refusing the new blocks which break his rules. By refusing updating his core instance. Bitcoin always put the right of deciding whether a block is valid in the hand of the user, which is why miners can't change the 21M limit at their convenience. The user must decide explicitely to gave up this right.
This is a question of principle, you agreed with some rules about how bitcoin work, if they are violated, it is your right to decide whether or not you accept it. Even if it means your chain has no value anymore, this is still a decision to take that you can delegate. But this should be an explicit delegation.
Imagine now, that all users delegate their right to a single entity.
Now if this entity + miners collude for bumping the Bitcoin limit, it will succeed.

I was not sure about responding at all at this problem, because, in a nutshell, if you are not even a programmer, there is no way you find the cure for the problem by out smarting the core devs. But I'll give you some material to point out why it is a bad idea.


Since the miners of your choosing will most likely be the one that others will also be choosing (because you can't choose a miner you does not know), we would have a "Long Tail" distribution of miners, which means increased centralization.
You can see what are the underlying model which result into such distribution in (P551) on 
[Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World]( and you will see that your model is exactly that.
Now if I am a new pool nobody has heard about, then I'll never get any transaction to mine, thus financially favoring well established pools.

But the reality is lots of software are unmaintained piece of garbage with nodes stored in a closet, and an owner who either forgot it, or don't have any dev anymore remaining to know how to operate the thing.
This also assume that everybody will be fine to update their node to classic given the 75%/4 week conditions, and I don't think the community is up to do that either... Even if globally people are, I think ok for 2 MB in one or two years, I'm sure there is no support with 4 weeks grace period.
What happen if miners assume the community is OK whereas they are not, and update without a part of it ? I prefer not thinking about it.
Being for 2MB is one thing, pushing it so fast is completely another, even 20MB with 1 year delay is less dangerous than that.

Hi, no it is not failing. My company, Metaco, is working on having financial institution to emit their asset as colored coin.
More importantly, with OP_CSV + Segwit, it will become possible for issuers to host "payment hubs" which will permit scalable off chain  asset exchange between participants, while giving them the possibility to get their asset back on blockchain when they want.
We have a testnet version of metaco for now (testnet.metaco.com) and asset exchange will be possible through mycelium at term. (without using our website) This is why we are on the partner page of Mycelium actually.

This is not a problem, if a user came to bitcoin because it is "almost instant" and "almost free", he was misguided. Paypal works better for this case.
And I don't agree, during the spam attack the few transactions that got stuck were because wallet used fixed KB fees. Now it is fix, a spam attacks is much harder because it will propels fees up, making itself more expensive and more expensive to bother users.
A smart fee calculation is a dynamic solution to a spam attack. 
When there is no spam, it is like we had fixed fees like before, and when there is spam, it automatically make it more expensive.
For genuine usage, the problem of a transaction not being mined would only appear if there is an unpredictable spike of genuine bitcoin transaction (assuming smart fees policies). If the tx rate was predictable, then the right fee would also be predictable by wallet, and would be able to prevent transaction from being stuck.
The case you are making would only happen very rarely for big unpredictable bitcoin adoption spike until fees algorithm catch up. (which would be in a matter of hour)

The new script op CLTV does the reverse : You can spend when it is Above a certain limit. So in the past, I asked myself, why not doing "Below a certain limit".
The reason is the following : If a block get orphaned, there is an assumption in Bitcoin, that the transactions that it belonged to can be re-broacasted.
Since your question would break the assumption, it is not possible to do it.
The only way you can do it is to spend it at 363,326. BUT you have no guarantee, the block 363,326(a) can be orphaned by a block 363,326(b) so the transaction might pass at 363,327. (child of b)

It depends on how much there is, which put us back in the question of how to ensure there are enough. (and which does not need to run in cloud services as amazon)
Needless to say, that mining fee will be a small part of the price of dealing on bitcoin compared to what you'll need to pay block explorer, who would not be able to be as cheap as today.

The spam was not a problem at all, and thus need no solution, everybody acted for their own interest with the way of their choice (spam filters, minrelayfees, mining higher fee tx in priority...), and business continued as usual, core devs tooks some steps in 0.11.

Wallet services, Miners, Core Devs, Service Providers, all acted with their own way to the attack and it makes any new spam attack a non-event.

Well, statically speaking 100% of fiat currencies die on day or another, this is not a high level analysis to predict this may happen to the euro and usd in our lifetime. When it happens, there is either a rush to other fiat, or to commodities.

It is not yet ready for that though, but technically speaking it will be able to handle it very soon.

You have to keep key online only if you want to earn money by routing transactions.

Put you in the shoes of a customer of some web service you like, let's say blockchain.info.
For sake of example, imagine that blockchain.info change the url for their api from blockchain.info to api.blockchain.info. Now they announce that on their blog.
You are not following their blog because you have better business to do as you run a payment processor or an exchange.
Now after 4 weeks, you discover the call to the API does not work, customers are calling you and freaking out you scammed exit them or that you lied on your SLA.
Now, you ask to bc.i what the fuck happened. And bc.i tells you: we change the api url, this is a simple change and we told so 4 weeks ago on our blog. So yes, the fix is simple, but breaking software with such short notice is not responsible.
I can guarantee you that no sane company would do such kind of thing as customer will quickly go to see the competition who does not break their business. Microsoft API's for example always take 1 year to deprecate, and this is way lower stake than bitcoin.
This is also assuming that miners AND the community agree with 75/28 days. Which is not the case. Now imagine a significant part of the community say "we don't change" after 2 weeks of the grace period. And suddenly you have apocalypse coming and price crashing as uncertainty appear and possibility of 2 currencies arise. Some miners remove their classic nodes, other do not and it is all a big freaking mess that don't have to happen. If you want to kill credibility in Bitcoin this is the way to go.
When gavin says "we told to miners they seemed ok with 4 weeks", it is like bc.i said "we asked Samurai Wallet (since they use bc.i), they said they can change the uri in 4 weeks". Yes they can, but not all your users, miners are not your only users, the others might not even be aware of you breaking stuff, and I'm not even assuming they don't have tech expertise to find how to change the URL.

I am not against 2MB. I find it is not useful to do it, and not the fastest way, because you just don't update a whole network in 4 week, and even less when lots of people are opposed to 2MB as proposed.
I'm saying that I want to see it planned something like next year or in 2 years, with 1 year grace period, even if not strictly needed, because I think this has consensus and would not hurt the network.
However, I think has concern that with SW 3.5MB worth of bandwidth would be problematic.

I think people are using plausible deniability wrong by using decoy.
If your attacker see that you bought your starbuck with an address which does not belongs to the wallet you are giving him, he'll catch the trick.
I think it is a way better strategy to use always the same wallet with a small amount on it, and another one with all your reserves on the same trezor. And always use the small wallet for paying stuff, as well as for giving to an attacker. (in other word Hot + Cold wallet, and if any attack, give the Hot one)

Well, I don't think such strategy works on the long term.
The problem is that in such case they will use Bitcoin as they use whatever point card program. And just forget it when the deal is off.
If they do not forget it, I think that people which came to bitcoin for these reasons are also very oblivious on the security aspects and how to manage one own's money. Even if some wallets make lots of effort to teach them (like breadwallet), using Bitcoin as an serious alternative value transfer needs you also need to know about plausible deniability for example.
For Bitcoin to stick, I think that people need to be more conscious about the nature of money, it takes a deep change of perspective. But I think this will eventually happen as traumatic experiences caused by the banking system increases. (account freezes, bank run, capital control)
No need to "force them" to understand what is behind the scene, they will learn fast as soon as they feel the water boiling. This is why I think there is no need to convince the skeptic and no need to dress Bitcoin with stars and kittens for convincing them.

With segwit adopted this year, the limit will be increased at the same time as adoption increase. Also there is significant amount of spam that will disappear before fee become significant for hurting adoption. (Paying 20 cts per tx instead of 10 would have less impact on adoption than on spam, which is by definition the most sensitive to fee)


Then welcome segwit, it makes LN more feasible and allow us to support around 14 million users irrespective of the number of transaction. If your concern is the short term, segwit already lift enough for short term. Yes maybe 2MB HF will be needed after that still, but this is far from urgent.
@_date: 2016-02-15 05:57:30
Right, marketing strategy from Classic is simple "You support 2MB HF ? then you support us" Let's add you to the list of our supporters to show the consensus behind us.
That's not how it works. I'm myself for 2MB HF, but consider Classic as a big threat to Bitcoin. As an analogy: Self defense is a good idea, but I would not give a gun to a 6 years old kid so he can defend himself.
It is also difficult for outsider to understand that 2MB != 2MB HF != Classic. Because 2MB can be interpreted as segwit as well. So outsiders just assume that everything is the same and support classic.

You may whitelist a root HD public key, and the app would provide ledger the path of the children HD key that the ledger of the inputs the ledger need to sign. I don't believe the X509 is a good solution for the reason you said.
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:02:18
The lack of hard user confirmation on ledger bother me. I would advice Trezor for classical user usage.
Ledger is better for managing hot wallet of servers though. (since it is not possible to disable hard user confirmation on Trezor)
That said, I have used neither yet, I needed to compare them for one project I am doing.
I forgot : Trezor can be used to authenticate yourself to services that support it... this is hugely cool !

Don't forget that Core is by a majority a team of unpaid volunteers. Having someone to tell them "you need to deliver by X" is a bit complicated under those circumstances.
However, I think for developers that were there, they might have good stuff to deliver by this date... But as always it should be considered their personal commitment and not the team's commitment, as you can't simply impose a deadline to people who works on Bitcoin for free.

I responded on  about 28.
90, even 95% would be nice. A miner going against the ecosystem can't keep his hashing power for long as he would loose revenue from renting his hardware to other miners. Previous softfork with 95 had no problem. I'd be ok with 90, but I'm sure 95% can pass as far as 2MB is concerned with sufficient grace period. (1 year)
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:02:51
Correct. The question is whether they will do it or not as they can claim "we only redeem Bitcoin".
I would not take the risk.
If tomorrow I create an altcoin by for example changing POW, and not callling it Bitcoin. Would Coinbase will allow me to redeem on this chain even if it is at first unpopular ? I doubt.

this rank pretty high on the pettiness scale.
That said great, bitcoin does not require your trust to blockstream nor anyone's.
It's also understandable he changed his title, as he did not want to give the impression (I think) that Blockstream have impact on core's decision, which is true. Even as the president, he can't order core devs to work on something they don't want, as maaku rejection of the roundtable clearly show.
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:25:10
The general problem is that if it takes 5 minutes to say a stupid things, it takes 10 to read it, to understand and reply why. (assuming no bad faith)
Thus, there is a sort of "proof of work" used by core devs for preventing spam that is the following : If you have not contributed to the code, then there is high chance you will say something stupid or say something already talken about. The cost of reading to make sure of it, is higher that the benefit of too high, your post will be ignored.
Not to say you will necessarily say stupid thing, but the odd are so low that it is not worth reading you if you are not a real contributor. (I don't intend to be mean, just try to be in their position)
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:59:33
because it cost money to make a decentralized payment system work at scale in term of bandwidth, electricity and storage. If you want low cost, either use a centralized service OR use a decentralized one which is not used a lot.
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:20:44
Libertarians and anarcho capitalists are not against having a central authority dictating what can be told on his plateform, as long as he is the owner.
What they say is that the market will find by itself the right amount of security versus repression by giving their money to service that serve best their interest.
Libertarian and anarcho capitalist are against state, (which impose rules even on what does not belong to it) not against central authority of owners (who impose rules on what belongs to them).
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:01:12
I was arguing about the fact that if you allow a user to whitelist his miners, then you'll ends up by having a more centralized system instead of decentralized one, since the unknown miner will have no way to get the transactions.
It would also oblige miners to be identified instead of anonymous.
@_date: 2016-02-14 06:26:09
Nice point about "spliting off from all the people who believe Bitcoin should behave the way Brian says". The main problem remain that for existing software/service, there is not good solution. You can't expect a breadwallet to support 2 bitcoins, as it would confuse the user for example. (Not even speaking about the technical difficulty)
So I think the Classic minority will never start their coins, until they are sure that the existing infrastruction will use classic coin and not core coin.
The winner will be the one who can convert the existing infrastructure and hype to their coin. This is sure that classic won't fork until they can do it. But I suspect core would continue if the infrastructure follow classic... But everything will be needed to be rebuilt from scratch. In such case, maybe starting a whole new currency and getting ride of bitcoin legacy is better. (founded with proof of burn on the classic chain)

I disagree, 90% 2MB with enough grace period can be reached. The "No HF ever" proponents are a small minority, even in the core team.
Also, one again, this is not too late for 6 month grace period as SW results will come very fast, itself it already kick the can. (just by seeing how much wallet/framework are already ready supporting it)
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:56:07
I think the worst case scenario is: More than 50 percent hash rate do not support UASF.
In such case, UASF nodes will chain split from non-UASF ones.
Non-upgraded will be under the threat of big reorg if the hash power start transitioning to UASF chain.
If the situation get not fixed in time, the non-upgraded chain can make a soft fork to consider the UASF chain invalid. In such case we would have 2 bitcoins chain.

You are right about the cost of double spread which is not negligible.
The big difference though is that you don't have to use a regulated institution to convert your BTC to fiat, and this is a killer feature, here is a real world example :
Argentina have blue rate and official rate for their currency. (the official overvalues the Peso, sometimes by more than 40%)
Let's say : 15 pesos per EUR in blue, and 9 pesos in official.
Now if someone in argentina get paid by a company aboard 100 EUR, and need some pesos. 
If he uses a licensed remittance service with 1% spread.
100EUR becomes 900 pesos, minus spread, 891 pesos. (you can't use black market for that)
If he uses Bitcoin with 5% spread on each side (via black market with blue rate)
100EUR becomes 1500 pesos, minus two spread, 1350 pesos (not calculated exactly)
Despite the higher spread, you can see that bitcoin is still favorable, because of the government manipulation of the rate of their currency.
Conclusion : The spread is not the only cost, government monetary control is good for Bitcoin in general.
Some information about the rates : 
The black market, in those countries, is not the exception but the norm of doing business.
The question is not whether clear market bitcoin remittance services will be more competitive than clear fiat one. The question is whether clear market fiat remittance services can be more competitive than black market bitcoin remittance services.

The problem is not 2MB, the problem is how it will be rolled out (short notice) which can cause a split. Such split can't happen with SW. Being for 2MB and against Classic is not a contradiction.

If you are a reader unaware of what is going on, the interpretation you get is: Community wants a block size increase, Core prevents it and nobody care about Segwit. And both statement are wrong.
Agreed that my term "rejected" is maybe too hard.


20% of node, with most are done by single person spawning spot instance on amazon to fake support. (Effectively Sybil attacking the network)
There was a post on to teach how to spawn several classic nodes easily on Classic, if you want I can find it back.
40% of the 600 classic nodes are hosted big datacenters compared to 20% on Core.
By reading the article, you get the impression that Core is a minority, and that Classic will force the change. Both of that are untrue. As well as thinking if you support 2MB you will necessary run Classic.
There is lots of important nuance left out.

LN is not a band aid, nor it is forced by anyone.
LN is the only way to scale, as it use less resources than on chain payment. Even better, it provides incentives for running LN nodes, things that we could not do for Bitcoin nodes.
Some big block advocates see LN as the competitor of bigblock... it is not, both solutions are not on the same category. One is about going from 7tx to 200 tx per sec. The other is about achieving Visa scale.
Even with infinite block size, LN will win, as it simply consume less resources.

Yes I think there will be a significant difference, as people won't have software explosing in their hands if they missed the HF announcement, or worse getting scammed because they see an unconf payment on the wrong chain.
No, software should not break so quickly.
Take the perspective of an web service provider. Imagine you want to change the endpoint URL to your web service. 
How would it reflect to announce on your company's blog: "in 4 weeks, the URL will change, the change is simple though", and tell them "too bad if you are unmaintained, but it's best your break now than later".
For the customers following your blog, this would be highly frustrating, but imagine the customers not following your blog who suddenly find out your API does not work and their own customers can't get job done, and you explain them "we told you on our blog 4 weeks ago".
And I'm not even talking about what happen if miners does something that the community does not follow, as I think would happen with 75%/4 weeks.
@_date: 2016-09-04 06:56:52
Well, you can calculate that quite easily:
Data example:
-Money supply: 100BTC
-Miner reserve: 10BTC
-Reward: 1BTC
He has the choice to make: Burn the reward to appreciate his miner reserve or keep the reward.
If he keeps the reward he owns the value of: 
11 BTC pre decision.
If he burn the reward:
His reserve appreciated 1% because of decrease of money supply so he owns. So he owns:
10.1 BTC pre decision
So it is his interest to keep the reward.
Replace the input data with current real data.

Ping it is an improvement as the coin you mix gives you plausible deniability to be any of the 49 participants to the meeting mix. Though, later you need to be careful not to join your mixed coins together. You can do this by sending to your exchange one full coin (without change) to the exchange at a time.

Mmh I am not sure. It depends on what the token is traded for with the increased velocity. If the velocity increase because trades of goods settled in Bitcoin increases (let's call that adoption), but that the supply of Bitcoin in fiat market stay the same (i.e. merchant not cashing out), you get an increase of price of Bitcoin. This is due to the fact that part of the trades made in Bitcoin were done in fiat before, so the utility of fiat decreased, increasing its supply in fiat market.
That said there is nothing indicating that a bigger maximum transaction throughput increase velocity.

If you have some solid real estate, this is a bit better, but won't save you either if shit hit the fan.
The safest way to diversify without Bitcoin is having bank accounts in different jurisdictions which does not cooperate with each others.
With Bitcoin I do not need to do that though, it depends on no one but myself to protect it. And I can cross border easily as soon as I can feel a threat. Sure it is subject to fluctuation, so what? I don't really care about volatility, as long as I am sure I can spend it how I want without asking for permissions.

Bitcoin has more of these 1% than any community, because most of its users have already being neglected by banking system or their trust broken. THey will naturaly come here and feel very passionate about it. Bitcoiners are still outcasts, even if it is becoming better as it reaches mainstream.
I do regularly LocalBitcoins trade and most of the people I buy/sell (I would say 90%) are using Bitcoin because they are neglected by the banking industry. In Japan, when you are a gaijin (expat), the banks do not trust you. Opening a bank account is hard, unless you work for big business and have a stable address. (stable address being hard, as renters do not often trust gaijin either)
I think the HODLing spirit is a manifestation of years of banking frustration transformed into hope.
In other words, I think a large percentage really USE bitcoin, more than invest into it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:49:17
No they don't, this is not meant to be one server per merchant, even though it would be ideal. Anybody can host it and make several merchant join their server.
As I said, it is drop in replacement, if something was working on Bitpay but not on BTCPay server, it is indeed a bug I will fix.
There is docker images so you don't even need .NET on your computer. (I can also provide self contained app which is naive to plateform and does not require .NET Core to run, without docker)
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:48:02

I think this article only concern exchanges. When they sell Bitcoin to you they did not charged VAT but it was risky, as tax authorities might came later to their business to recover what they should have charged to their customer. Now they know it won't happen.
If it meant you could bypass VAT by accepting Bitcoin it means that everything paid with Bitcoin would be instantly between 5 and 20 percent less expensive, which I don't think any sane government would agree to.

You may be fine if you are always living in the same country for long time with predicatble buying pattern. If you have kind on unconventional lifestyle, then high probability they will make you headaches.

It does not make you money, but it is still better than if you sold, in which case you would loose money with inflation.

This is exactly the reason, webforms was for windows desktop devs. And to be honest, it was very successful with it. In a sense it is not different from nodejs which has been made for front end devs.
Making nice looking presentation of your sql data is always so much easier in asp.net webforms, for simple crud apps, it is still the best in my opinion. But yeah, I would not advise that for long term maintainability.

Will Linux die if devs leave ? no, this is open source, and other dev will come. This is the beauty of open source versus closed source which can be dropped by a company. An open source project never die, as long as the community exists.

I think Pieter Wuille has the right approach given his skills, everybody should focus on what they are doing best and collaborate with others for the rest.
That said, if all devs were shutting up and only focusing on code, not explaining to non technical audience, the false information would keep spreading.
The community speaking up is not a waste of time, but a necessity so devs can continue to code without having all their time consumed by explaining themselves to non technical audiences.

Main difference is ASPNet Core MVC. In old .net you have two framework: webAPI and MVC for json API and web pages respectively, each duplicate lots of type and are architecturally similar. 
.NETCore merged both in a single framework.
This is a bit different, but still easy to catch-up for net devs.

Fantastic. Harder question, does any of those allow me the ability to do a one-click deploy like the Azure deploy button, Heroku Deploy button or Docker cloud Deploy button? Anything which would allow a non technical user to not having to mess around with command line.
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:06:36
So we should admit that that :


Match Snowden pretty well, I guess you want to point out the "purpose and effect" required.


All is to prove that snowden did not gain commercial interest/advantages.
I am surprised, that, even if such directive is not specifically aimed to Snowden, Obama declare such ban of donation for commercial secret and not for state secrets. State secret put greater risk on "national security".
If this executive order is passed, I see no reason why another dealing with state secrets should not pass. It is a dangerous precedent.

Right now it is not supported. I will propose a simple JSON service standard that exchange will (or not) implement. I get bylls on board (Canadian exchange), I also  will have Switzerland for a reason my company Metaco will announce soon.

To be clear, when I say "The goal is that you don't need command line", I am not referring about making BTCPay a pain to use for power users.
Power users can still use command line, the host of their choice and hand pick their domain provider if they want. It is how it works now, and how it will continue to work.
But my goal is to provide a way for computer illiterate to use BTCPay as easily that they can use a mobile app, without trusting anything else than their hosts and domain provider.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:10:45
thanks for the clarification.
Appreciate your patience to explain, it seems, from what you are saying, that the EO is broader than the actual execution of it.
However, clearly, in the EO nothing bind the Secretery of Treasury to use OFAC's Enforcement Guidelines or any list.
I don't know whether or not it is intentional, but the broader sense may include snowden when the Secretary of Treasury (in consultation with 2 other officials) decides to do so, regarless of the way they want to do it.

If you install your own BTCPay server and do not rely on a hosted one, you do not rely on a third party. If you are too lazy, you will have to pay a third party who do that for you. If both options are not possible to you, then you can't use the service.
BTCPay has been done to not rely on Bitpay, and give back merchant who wants control of their own node to run their commerce.

BTCPay requires the user to have his own domain, and host it on his own server.

Individuals do choose the changes that they accept. If they are in consensus, then it will be accepted. 
But when someone ask "why the community does not fund the core devs", he forgets that the "community" has no brain of its own, and if he considers himself part of it, a better question is : Why has he himself not given more money to the devs that are dedicating so much of their time ?
Or in ops' words : "what is stopping him from funding the development of Bitcoin ?"

If anything is learnt by BCH with their shitty diff adjustment  is that several hour blocks are not really a problem as far as price is concerned. Even less with Bitcoin, where the fee raising  will make miner wants to take it.
@_date: 2015-09-05 00:01:54
I fully agree with this point. (and why I am confident that if changes are needed, they will be applied anyway and the bargaining over nit in BIPs will cut short)
The only difference is that I don't think full block and rise of fees will pressure a lot on the short term. The least important usage of the blockchain will be kicked out like SatoshiDice. Then only after some incentives will appear. But I think we have reasonable time before it happens.
Once pressure build, change will happen. No need to pressure "in prevention".

Funny, I asked myself the same question yesterday when I saw the post about 101. Glad to know I'm not alone.
The posts are numerous and brainless, and it is very strange that redditors who wanted only block size increase at the first time, try to push 101 forward when 100 have higher chance of reaching consensus.
If one want bigger block, you have more chance to succeed by encouraging 100 than 101. This really makes no sense to me. Stranger, is that you would expect miners to follow the trend because users can pay the mining pool like slush to vote for them, but nobody does. I think there is some professional troll as well which either want BIP101 or divide the community. In any case, miners are not dupe since they are the one having stakes at work, I don't think a troll attack is dangerous. At wost wasting the devs time.

Every action is a choice between alternative, this is the definition of economics from Mises.
Even if there is only one exchange (mtgox), you take a choice between not moving your coins OR moving them and taking the risk to be scammed.
Knowing you may be scammed is not enough to not use a service, the question is : what do I earn by taking this risk, and can I afford it ? You can mitigate the risk to some extent. (eg, not putting too much money on blockchain info)
Being scammed is the cost of doing business in an area where law is lagging behind. I am not yet convinced the cost of getting scammed is higher than the cost of the regulatory apparatus, this depends on the situation. If you are an hedge fund with smart money, the cost of getting scammed is higher than the cost of your lawyers in an area with clear regulation.
If you are an individual, you may prefer taking the risk of getting scammed by exchanging bitcoin in p2p with an unknown person than complying to the regulatory paperwork and having your financial information at risks.
Sometimes, as a person, you don't even have access to justice because you can't afford a lawyer, being scammed may be less costly for you.
Scam is only a cost in the scheme of thing. Does the cost is justifiable ? sometimes it does.

Imagine all currencies goes down in value. What would "go down" would mean ? We always implicitly says "a currency goes down compared to others". So what would means "all currency goes down" ?
I suspect he means that it would take more currency to buy goods. If that's case, then if he wanted to earn wealth compared to other currency holders, then he should have invested into these goods right before the fall of currencies right ?
Well, Bitcoin happens to be one of such goods.
UPDATE : But the thing you should have asked him is : "why do you think that bitcoin would go down if other currency does ?"

I don't agree, there is no "demand for free", there is "demand for looking at movies", to which you have two solutions : piracy or paying.
Piracy has also his own problems. (virus, pain to find movies, lots of ads everywhere, fakes...)

I think we are fine and the increase will come no matter what. The specific are very important for the core devs, but I think that most of the community (myself included) does not really care about the specific, as long as it is done in a way were core devs, miners and wallet providers agree. (ie, not detrimental to anyone)
And if they don't agree to change, then we will have to wait for real economic pressure related to the block size, at which point it will be easier to reach a consensus. In any case, I think it will eventually be resolved.

I understand, but all sides of the debate agree on your goal, there is no dispute about that. 
The question is whether a proposal would reach the intended goal ? so we must expose the hidden assumptions of each parties, and either debate such assumptions OR the reasoning which led them to our common wanted goal. 
It is about spotting error of judgment and error in reasoning.
I was not against BIP101, but one of the assumption was : It is urgent to do it now. Which led to several spam attacks in an attempt to prove it... except it disproved the assumption completely instead. (did you know there is an outstanding spam right now ? Can you feel it ? But I am happy they did it, it is an important precedent)
I think the consensus will be reached now it is clear time is not a problem, and if it becomes a problem, yes it will rush things but that's not necessary a bad thing either,  discomfort is necessary for action.

I am for 95% or 90% of the miners deciding. And if some core devs does not agree, there is very low chance miners also agree since this would be controversial for some sane reason. (core devs have always a great reasoning, sometimes disputable premises, but if the premise is disputable, miners will also dispute it)
Eventually, everybody will agree. Take an example, luke-jr who defends small block for now, with the same reasoning he currently has, might support bigger blocks when the demand will effectively rise, thus changing his stances on some BIP. Wlad is more or less in the same position. It might take more time, but it will happen.

Well, while Bitcoin bubbles are fine, this is not what ensure success on the long term : keeping it free from interference of bureaucrats is the long term value proposition of bitcoin.
Whether it will be for buying coffee, registering tiles, or storing wealth, we don't know. Usage will be dictated by technical capacities of the network, with the most important purposes realized first, not by wishful thinking.
Both BIP101 and BIP100 allows that to happen. Except Bip100, to my mind protect from some big miner's attacks.

No he is not rational, there was no censorship about BIP101 or any block size increase. Only about XT which should considered as an altcoin from the day the fork is planned to the day it would achieve majority and render old chain Bitcoins irrelevant.
You can't expect to call it bitcoin before that, it would be misleading. (XTCoins would not be fungible with Bitcoins)
If indeed, XTCoins is the sole winner, then XTCoins would not be altcoin anymore and be considered "Bitcoin". But until we see such a thing happen, it is only speculation and the dual currency should be considered as possible.

"Bitcoin community" as any social construct has no will and can do no action. Only individuals do.
The visible sum of the decisions and actions of these individuals is what is often falsefully call the "bitcoin community".
So the response is not "why the community does not blablabla...", the question is "why do YOU decide not to give any money to the core devs" ?
I am contributing to this community, I have given many hours and reached something like 1.5 BTC of donation, to which I am grateful. What would a company give me for all this time invested ? Probably 6 figures.
I am not a core dev, and even if I'm gladful for this badge of honor (1.5 BTC in donation), counting on altruism is not a viable business model for any open source developers.

"By communication" in my context, I'm talking about the big post written on bitcoin core website about segwit, the BIPs, and tools developped to help other understand how segwit work.
I agree that another layer may be needed tough, devs are better explaining their technical choices and coding than defending against social attacks. Even if a developer like greg can defend pretty well against social attack, as you said, I think his time would be best use coding and getting confidential transaction done.
There might be a good compromise between a centralized, corruptible bitcoin foundation, and the situation now, but I don't really know how. (studying how IETF or other standard body work might help)
But I think the situation now is not so bad, most developer stopped loosing their time on social media, and got back to code. And the community became kind of resilient to those social attacks. But agree that there may be improvement.

I don't remind my node having crashed in mainnet, and even if it did, the impact was not important enough to justify doing it first on testnet. The main complains were relative to human action : People pissed of transactions taking long time or stuck because of inappropriate fees. Such a thing would not have happened with a spam on testnet.
Developer time is limited, particulary in open source. They just take the most urgent problem at hand and fix it. So yes, in lots of case, it is only when the problem appear for real, and not in theory, that they have the incentive to resolve it, not before. This is what happen, only because for some odds reason we have only 24H per day.
"Transactions will be delayed because blocks are full" is way less important on developer scale than "Transactions are now delayed because Mainnet is full". Only the latter will provoke action of a developer. For that reason, I find it very coherent to provoke a spam so the problem is hit and actions are taken. But the spam is not guaranteed to reach "Transactions are now delayed because Mainnet is full", because of past improvement.

Yes, the system evolved accordingly. A spam, from economic point of view is no different from a low value transaction.


They are doing already by assigning priority to each transaction. Spam get the lowest one, SatoshiDice is only above in the priority scale. That the priority is assigned given some metric about the value of outputs, stricly about the fees or based on IP address, is irrelevant. What we know is that priority is assigned and transactions are not equal. The one with low priority will get kicked, and there is lots of low hanging fruits until the mainstream users fall from the rolling carpet.
However, once again, I am not against block increase. I am just pointing out the failed premises of BIP101 caused by faulty predictions about hypothetical apocalypse. I was one of the first to suggest a spam attack because I was giving the benefit of the doubt to 101.

I think wallet should show clearly in the interface if incoming transaction opt for RBF.
The point is that an incoming transaction with RBF have more risk to be double spent than without. For a merchant, it is a significant thing, they should be able to know their chance to be frauded.
By indicating to merchant RBF activation of an incoming transaction, this should put significant pressure on the users to not use it. ie, the merchant can say : if you have RBF, then you need wait 10 min after paying.

@_date: 2015-11-29 05:55:25


It is actually safer. Even if I agree with you that a double spend can theorically be carried out successfully by anybody regardless of RBF. The difference is that the skill required to double spend RBF is lower than double spending non-RBF. A stupid person won't take the trouble trying to double spend a non-RBF by definition of being stupid.


Which is good, there is lot of services which ask several confirmation  already anyway, in this case it is net improvement. But in a bar for example, you can't expect the merchant to wait confirmation. His only bet is to lower the chance to getting frauded, not removing all chances, showing RBF in UI help that goal. I am not saying RBF is bad for everything, only in a bar context.

I would say, if you abuse double spend you may also get caught. Most payment are tied to your identity and so cheating may have some black listing or account banned effect as well. 
Another example, in a coffee shop for example, double spending is highly impractical : You need to buy and drink in less than 10 min, and have the risk of having the staff running at you.
Another example : it took a while before merchant start refusing checks for example, and it was also a week confirmation to cash them out, not 10 min.

Price control can be achieved in three ways : Controlling the supply, controlling the demand, or outlawing "unfair price".
From economic perpectives those 3 ways have the same economic repercussions. (that is to say, affect the price equally)
This is what price control is. (the Soviet during the food shortage used the 3 ways)
Those three ways will always lead to either waste in some area and shortage in others.
You are basically defending that price controls was just poorly done by the soviet government, and that we are, westerners, superiors. And I say that price control, not poor government starved people. People can always produce freely even despite a poor government, but they can't do it with a price control.
And yes, the best way, most vicious way to control price is with the help of monetary policies.
You just have to give the fresh money to a carefully chosen set of people, which you know, demand the good whose price you want to control. 
If a shortage/waste appear because of the stealth price control, then they will point the finger to the people that accepted the money and blame the free market for the failure. Then they will justify explicit control over production and supply, that would have been considered immoral before the crisis they themselves created.

I'm not really familiar about the mining industry myself, so I don't have better answer.


Yes I even think it is not far fetched to think that ViaBTC for example decide to switch to Bitcoin Unlimited because they pocket some Bitcoin from Roger out-of-band. It is actually for the pool operator an alternative money stream: Monetizing their policies. We should assume it is possible, and will (or is) exploited. But I think pool operator does not enter in the 5% which matter.
Imposing an unpopular policy come at the cost of exodus of the miners from the pool. Moving from one pool to another is very easy. 
At the end of the day, I think that if you want to stop a feature, you need to convince 5% of people who finances the actual mining power. A mining pool operator is not part of it, and can only bring temporary nuisance until their miners go somewhere with better policies. I don't think BU have that much support among miners.
The money they get for pushing unpopular policy (a speculation that I don't think far fetched) will dry out, or the pressure of the exodus will put them back on the right track to find a compromise. (BU+Segwit)

You are going too far, those people already see the blockchain as valuable.


The only thing they don't understand is why the monetary incentive is needed to make it works. Once they understand, you can say : the intrinsic value of bitcoin is the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-11-18 06:27:08
I think the durability of money take the root in the first commodities which were exchanged as money. For example, tobacco or wheat, both of them were more "fragile" than metal money which came after, in the sense it was easily destroyed by time.
Your Bitcoin will still be in the blockchain in 100 years because to make it disappears one need to censor all copies of the blockchain. This is why it is "durable".

What about using  , where, instead of the refund transaction, it is the first commitment sending 100% to the sender and 0% to the counterparty.

I don't know a lot about the mining industry, but I'm wondering if the presence of a patent might not be good for decentralisation by pushing ASIC manufacturing into black market. The buyer of such ASIC can't be easily noticed, I wonder if the manufacturer can stay hidden easily though.
Public mining farms who must play by the rules to benefit from the improvement would become at disadvantage compared to black market miners (miners breaking the patent). Which should push them to not stay public.

I'm amazed and excited by what you are doing. My question might be a bit technical, not sure if it is right for the AMA.
We planned to use ledger for a project, for a specific reason : We explain to our users to attach the ledger on their key ring, so every times they leave their computer, they take the key with them.
We are using the ledger in server mode, so the manual check for the user to sign a transaction is disabled. (relatively safe environment, we have more to fear about internal theft than malware)
The problem is that ledger nano is slow. It can take up to 1min to sign some of our transactions. (which are bigger than classic user transaction)
Will you release a device like nano, without screen and nothing fancy, but only more powerful for server mode purpose ?
Anyway, not a big deal if you don't plan since the next wave of your product with TEE may solve the speed issue. (except we can't expect our user to attach the TEE on their key ring :( )

yes inherent value = use value.

I did not discussed their legitimacy, only the result of the necessarily bad price control that might make starve people. Soviets planners were mostly doing that for the good of society also.
Using Bitcoin do not solve bad political party, it just provide a way to edge against the consequence of planned monetary policies.
I am not even advocating that those people at the FED are bad. The truth is that they really believe they are acting for the good of all. As well as regulators think that it is in our own good to control prices.
But Bitcoin provides a way to ignore completely what they think and just opt out. Bitcoin does not thrive because of government approval, but because people choose to buy it against other alternatives. The government might bans Bitcoin, it will not change the fact that I can store my wealth on it and transfer/receive it overseas in a fraction of second. And don't have to employ guards or banks to protect it.

Before considering what is "inherent" or "true" value, you have to start to consider learning what "value" is about.
The value of something is a rank in a list of alternative choices at the disposal of each individual.
Your question suppose there is an objective standard of value, but to show that you value is subjective, I'll take a well know example :
* Do you prefer one pound of gold or 1 liter of water ?
I'm very sure you valued gold more than water.
Now, imagine you are in the desert, and I ask you :
* Do you prefer one pound of gold or 1 liter of water ?
If value was objective concept, you would have chosen the same good in both instances. But you did not.
People often think that the concept of "inherent value" refer to an objective standard of value. This is wrong. "Inherent value" is better called "use value", which mean : if people does not use the good as money (called exchange value), the remaining estimated value of the good by the person is called "inherent", and I prefer saying "use value".
So you should ask this question : If Bitcoin stop being used as a form of money, would it still be used for something else ? If you think yes, then you found inherent value.
When someone says "nothing is inherent" what they mean is that value is not objective. But "inherent value" is in reality not contradictory with the fact that value is subjective. This is why I prefer the term "use value" rather than "inherent value".

Just a small summary :
At worst, it means that ECC is broken, which means satoshi's coin can be stolen as well as any reused address. This is only speculation to explain the strange behavior of the NSA.
The author is saying basically that : We are not advanced enough in quantum computing so this should not be the reason, that NSA did not bugged their curve because they chose parameters based on a SHA1. If they chose the input of the SHA1 to get a "backdoored curve", then it would also mean, knowing the computing power of those days, that ECC is broken.
So he suspects advances in solutions for the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem, which would be the worst thing ever. (if satoshi's coin are stolen, it would make the market havoc)
Is it realistic and a good reasoning ? I don't know enough about that, u/nullc probably knows.

Commit access is a "badge of authority" among the group of core contributors. This is how it should be, as core is nothing but a group of contributors with someone which commit the contributions to master.
Gavin used it as a "badge of authority" outside the core contributor group. Which might not be a big deal as long as he does significant work in core and is competent enough to know what he does. (which he seemed to finally proved in a way that the layman can understand)
It should be noted that current committers never used it as badge of authority outside the core contribution. (and actually even inside it, as wumpus will never merge anything that is controversial among contributors)

As I recognize the fungibility problem, let's put things into perspective :
10k USD in france is not fungible with 
10k USD in US. (If you want to convert one into the other, you hit regulation walls and middle men)
10K in cash you earn at the lottery is not as fungible as 10K in cash you earned by working. (Tax differences)
Sure, a store will not care about the different kinds of cash. But your government, and by extension, all exchanges compliant with the regulation do the difference. (As with Bitcoin)
The reason why you don't care about that with fiat cash, is because of stores accepting them all whatever from where they come from.
Enforcement of whitelisting internationally for every store is not possible. With Coinjoin schemes into existence, eventually, all coins will become blacklisted and either Bitcoin banned, either whitelisting removed.
The fungibility problems is thus exactly the same as the probability of Bitcoin to be banned.
There is some odds to be true, however, nor Darkcoin nor ZeroCoin fix the problem of ban.

Anonymity is not a black and white matter.
When someone knows something about you, he can use it against you. Anonymity is about understanding who learns what about you when you do a transaction.
Physical money is still the best to my opinion, but you can't transfer on internet. And not completely anonymous : you leak your location and physical appearance.
Bitcoin anonymous in other way : just by looking at the blockchain you would be able to find only a small part of what I own.  Also, I don't leak my location and physical appearance contrary to cash.
Whether leaking one type of another type of information to X or Y is a problem for you depends on your individual case. But even with cash you leak something. That said, there may be crypto that leak less info than bitcoin, whether or not they are worth it depends on how much abuse are committed because of the leaks of bitcoin transactions.

No. If a currency goes up I spend it, because it means I saved money by not spending it before it have gone up.
If a currency goes down, I hoard it, because if I spend it, it means I would loose money compared if I spent it before.
The question is different if I know in advance that the currency WILL goes down or up, in this case I would move my wealth out from the down currency to the up one... as every sound people should do and is doing. (101K, pension, stocks, real estate, art, alt currencies, commodities)
Who profits from it ? the middle men of those transactions.
Who loose from it ? the men to which I would have given my money instead of the middle men, as well as myself by giving money to services I would never have used without being forced to.

It is a long post, which rely on an assumption that is not explained. Based on the wrong assumption, I can prove to you that 1 + 1 = 10.
That said, I may read the rest once I find you can make this assumption more reasonable.


By your assumption, you are projecting that 0.35% will still be the best to expect, even in such period. This is untrue. Even if I accept the fact that some meteorite come into Bitcoin which make all miners turning off their rig because profitability dropped, if it still has use for users and business, they will just raise the fee to make it become profitable once again.
What might happen, if I accept your conclusion without even looking at your premise, is a sudden peak of transaction fee. The market does not stay still to change. If mining is valuable, then people will pay for it as fee or mining contract. If it is temporary, then business will foot the bill until readjustment instead of crashing their business.

I agree with you, and this is why fungibility can bring down Bitcoin. Tomorrow, whitelists might be enforced by law, and every physical business will have no way to escape it. (except by stopping using BTC)


I disagree, most totalitarian regime in the past came by democratic means. (Hayek document that very well with in "The road to serfdom")
Even for our "non authoritarian regime" like the US, don't forget  that Executive Order 6102, allowed the government to steal the gold of its people, and no civil war happened. If such event can't trigger a civil war, what are the odds that the enforcement of whitelisting trigger one ?

4. Estimated amount that you would be depositing/withdrawing to/from your Bitstamp account per month (in &gt;USD and BTC)?
I guess I'll open my open bazaar weed store, I just need to convert less than 10K USD per month. The rest will stay in bitcoin. I will be a market maker on joinmarket, it offers me better interest rate than my bank.
5. What type of trading will you conduct? Buying/selling/both? Estimated trade volume per month?
6. What are your future plans and activities planned on our exchange?
7. What is the source of the funds which you have so far deposited to your Bitstamp account?

Unrealistic assumption, I would like to read the rest but you can't construct a rational argument on top of shaky assumption like that.

yes but you can proove it the following way :

* Sign an input of the transaction with your private key (by spending a coin for example)
* Stop attacking at this date as predicted
* Release the statement to the world, with the TxId where you published the hash.

The point is that OpenId is already implemented in tons of framework, and website, the step to add one OpenId provider is very low once it has already been implemented. I'll study your paper, but from what I understand, with OpenId, the identiy provider is just in charge of signing a token which certify the party has identified to identity provider. Whether or not such provider use BitId is out of the concern of the website developer. The website developer just have to add one more provider to his list, no more dev involved.

You will not do it for free. You will resuscitate because it is in your best interest. And if really you can't, and your best bet is to sell your asic as scrap metal, then the actors who does not want to see their business die just will just send fee as bounty to get next block done. They don't do it for free, they will do it because the alternative is worse for them.
Again the "fee will stay low whatever happen" is a strong assumption.
This is a problem that would be better be solved with smoother halving, but this would hardly be the end of bitcoin.
And it is even better with RBF ! Because people noticing their transaction stuck will bounty up to unlock them. Not by charity but because they want the transaction to be confirmed and ready to pay for it.

Well, objectively speaking it is a threat of the currency properties of Bitcoin. A currency needs to be fungible, and any attack to it weaken Bitcoin. But this is not against libertarian principle that some people, for their own gain/ideology, to attack fungibility of Bitcoin, or even Bitcoin it self. It is not because a libertarian do not agree with someone's action that he thinks "society" should step up to coerce him to NOT do that.
However, to keep things in perspective if fungibility becomes a problem, it will just give incentives to use Coinjoin schemes, which will fix the problem altogether.
@_date: 2015-10-29 04:24:30
This is a good response, I know that it piss me off when I write a big coherent explanation and get replied by someone who read the first line. :p
I am always scared about reading a long piece of argument invalidated by bad premises, but this is actually a better read than expected, but still leaving fee out of your equation is not reasonable.
I agree with effects 1 and 2, as well as mostly about the development which lead to the conclusion. But I don't accept one premise, and also note that you even goes against your own premise at one point of your demonstration.
That said, even if it would be nice to fix this problem with a hard fork, I don't think this is necessary, because fee will have a dynamic role when the problem will happen.
The question is not whether to expect fees to be 50% or 99% of miners revenue by 2020.
If miners stop mining because of the halving and we get stuck, then a way to get the blockchain run again is a corresponding amount of fee increase.
So if miners get, let's say, 0.1 BTC of fee, and 10 BTC in reward, after halving, if the blockchain stops we should expect 5 in reward and 5.1 in fee for the next 1008 blocks to make it starts again.
This means 5$ per transaction on today's price. (which is still competitive with today's wire transfer systems)
Since it is in the best interest of bitcoin companies to get the machine running, I expect one part of the loss will be assumed by miners, one part by companies paying higher fees than individual.
This is without talking about individual using RBF to get their transaction to confirm.
Even if I agree this would be nice to fix the problem by smoothing the halving, I don't think this would be a disaster because fee will play their role on short term, until adjustement catch up the problem.
Imagine a world where miners get 99% of revenue by fees, do you expect the heart attack to occur ? I guess you don't, because miners will prefer to foot the bill until next adjustment.
If it is 0.35% then the bill will be higher, for them, and some business will have no problem into paying high premium in transaction fees. From your premise, this will have no impact on the rate.
I would note that you are going against your own premises by saying


If you consider that the market will adapt because of profit opportunity, such that, we will not result into a sudden change rate change, then it is not reasonable to say afterward "if that happen then we'll suddenly have a drop of rate".

The first problem, is that their questions are very different from Gavin's everyday focus.

NBitcoin developer here, for parsing your folder :
    var store = new NBitcoin.BitcoinCore.BlockStore("c:/folder/blk", Network.Main);
    foreach(var blockItem in store.Enumerate(false))
    {
	var block = blockItem.Item;
	Console.WriteLine(block.Transactions.Count);
    }
You must not assume that blocks in blk dir are in order.
If you are just interested into the longest chain in the directory :
    var store = new NBitcoin.BitcoinCore.BlockStore("c:/folder/blk", Network.Main);
    ConcurrentChain chain = new ConcurrentChain(Network.Main);
    store.SynchronizeChain(chain);
    //Use chain here (chain keep just the headers in memory)
My [book]( might help you to get started with NBitcoin.
I have heavily optimized block dir parsing because I needed it long time ago, so it should be quick enough.

You can do lots of stuff, NBitcoin has built in script interpreter, you can connect to bitcoin node using the protocol directly, sign and check your transactions with RPC, support Open Asset (colored coin), have powerfull TransactionBuilder which will allows you to create complex transaction easily while preventing foot shooting.

I think this is true for the short term but false in the long.
Thinking that the tool should adapt to the human, and not the human to the tool is very doubtful.
The best tool adapted for the task win in the long term. Be it adapted for the human or not.
An example is the violin. Nobody can say that this instrument was designed for ease of use for average Joe. You have to use a non natural posture for using it, and it requires multiple year of practice. Nevertheless, at the end, it is the best suited for the task.
The tool often end up shaping the human but also how he thinks about a problem.

You are saying that Core is pushing BIP148 it is completely false. 
Some Core contributors might be for it, but no one represent Core as a whole. As a contributor, I myself opposed BIP148 in several occasion, as it can be quite disruptive. Core motto until now has been to be minimally disruptive, changing such behavior would be quite shocking for me.
That said, Core does not control Bitcoin, and do not prevent discussion of opposing idea. Some contributors opposed to BIP148 in Core might even checking the build and review the code.

I don't believe that fees will fail to increase, since he individual wants the transaction to confirm faster, the miner does not want to sell scrap iron, and the business holder don't want to get stuck as well and may pay on behalf of his customer to hide the disruption.
But that said, it still would be nice to fix the problem. I don't think there will be lots of resistance for the miners to accept such hardfork, nor in the rest of the industry. This is not controversial.

I think BIP148 risk people's money in case of big reorg. That is my only complain. I would oppose BIP148 into Core as Core always stood for safety and minimal disruption. (something we need for the digital gold)

I was responding to you about how control of price can be life threatening. "Bad government" is not what killed people, but "price control" was.
Since all prices are defined by the ratio between the commodity and the money buying it, the price can be modified by force either with policies on the commodity side, or on the monetary side.
Bitcoin takes out the control of the monetary side better than gold.
The difference with Gold is that there is no reason to print Bitcoins on a note/credit, as opposed to Gold. (bills, notes, or via credit)
The two reasons gold was printed is : 
There was not enough gold for daily exchanges. (the smallest coin was too expensive)
The cost of transporting gold over high distance was high.
Bitcoin solves those two problems.

The link refers to a way to make payment channel without malleability risk by gmaxwell.
Basically scenario is A pays to B :
* A asks B's pubkey
* A's create first commitment
* A calculate the hash that B needs to sign
* A ask B to sign this hash, without disclosing the commitment
* A broadcast anchor. B can't malleate it because he has no information to identify the anchor. (since using P2SH, he can not scan for his key)
* When confirmed, A anounce the anchor to B.

Bitcoin have been able to reach the stage it is now thanks to bitcoiners.
If the narrative of bitcoiners does not fit the comfortable experience of mainstream, bitcoiners don't have to adapt. 
Mainstream will become Bitcoiners, thanks to bank, capital control and regulations. No need to bow to mainstream, they will comes by themselves when they will feel their money is at risk. If they decide to get scammed by still using the old system, then it is best for us ! We'll have to pay less for their services since they will become poorer.
Bitcoin is not a startup app which need marketing budget and happy talk communication. Bitcoin will work because the alternative is worse.
The campaign "blockchain not bitcoin" is a way for suits to say "hey we have nothing to do with cypherpunk and libertarian of reddit, we don't endorse bitcoin, only the blockchain". They are forgetting that without those crazy guys driven by an ideological thrives for sound money, there would be no blockchain at all.

There is several reason why they will not keep it: 
* When it is obvious for some classic supporter that segwit and csv is a net gain, those will switch temporarily,
* When they become near 95% some miner will switch just so they don't take the risk of making invalid block when it switch,
* People on csv/segwit side will invest more hashing power,
* Some miners can have gentlemen agreements to make classic block invalid until segwit confirm (effectively moving the sf threshold)
5% is not near enough to stop the csv and segwit.

Actually this is a good question, this was the question I was asking concerning anonymous bitcoin donation. Under law you need to report your donator, but if you receive shit load of money without information, what happen ? do you have to give it to the police or tax authorities ?
However, this does not change the point : Imagine that all merchants need to accept only authorized coin or have risk of sanction. Then it means the black coins will get less value because harder to use.
I'm not so stressed about that though. If fungibility is a problem, worst which can happen, is another crypto currency fixing the issue gaining value. Since it is possible to do atomic transfer cross chain, people will be able to migrate. But this seems a priority to fix to me, but even if not fixed, it can't be worse than what we have today with fiat currencies. Also at worse, black coin will always be able to be spent in another country.

Core is not. Some developers who works on Core have listened the feedback of miners during their HK agreement. Miners wanted a hard fork ? Some are producing a useful hardfork. If the community and miners don't want it, I guess they won't fight for it if controversial, but we can't blame the participant of HK agreement for not having tried.
There is some chance though that some proposals will not be controversial, and net win for everyone.

For people making claim that if dices are not perfectly fair, then your key is at risk. I respond in one word : Bullshit.
Rolling a perfect dice with 16 possibilities add 4 bit of entropy at each throw.
Let's take the case of extremely unfair dice, where, out of the 16 possibilities, 8 of them never happens. It still add 3 bit of entropy at each throw.
Now, try for yourself : throw your unfair dice 20 times, this sum up to 60 bit of entropy.
Now, try to run:


{				
and wake me up when you are done. For more fun, you can also pass the number you got by concatenating your results into a KDF function, and see how much time it take to break your key.
The reason why casino dices are expensive is that large sum of money depends on a single throw. When you are doing 20, and depends on the concatenation of the result, it does not matter a lot anymore.

You can't consider "core", "miners", and "users" as three different entities. Saying core don't listen users and miners seem to imply that their dev don't give a shit about all users and miners, which is rather negative.
Core is is just a bunch of individual contributors working on things worthwhile *to themselves*, and luckily, what contributors do is also worthwhile for the majority of miners and users.
An open source contributor is not here to please, he contributes only for himself, his work is his own reward.

There is no extension blocks in segwit.


Such block would be rejected by all segwit enforcing nodes.
Once again, the mistake is to think that miners can change the rules at their convenience.
Even if you consider they do (which is wrong), you then have to explain why segwit is more dangerous than P2SH. If you can't find an explanation, then segwit does not add any additional hole that did not exist before.
I hear Rizun already "But P2SH you need the redeem script". Yes, but the miners know the redeem script as soon as you try to spend your output, so he would have control of your money as much as segwit output. (again, assuming that miner can dictate the consensus rules, which they can't)

For people advocating that physical threat can crack a password, this is true, but again crypto has his weapons for that.
First, someone will not threat you if he does not know what you have. (Steganography)
If he knows, you can mitigate how much he knows by spreading information at multiple place. (not on one laptop)
So he might know that you have 1 BTC on your laptop and threat you for that... but he does not know about the sheet of paper hidden in your shoes that have a private key worth 1000 BTC. (An Honey pot is also a defensive tool)
Also, you can setup a "destructive password". If he threats you to take your bitcoin wallet, you might setup a destructive password that would just delete the wallet from your computer. (The digital version of what we call "Dye pack" that bank used)

If you publish your block without witness data it will be rejected by the network.  You can't publish segwit data separately from your block.


If segwit is activated Chain 50 is completely ignored by everybody.
If you are talking about SPV, then P2SH have the same issue. 
Chain 50 is using only the preimage of the P2SH script, while chain 2 also include the signatures.


What you are describing is no different from a miner with majority hash power secretly mining, and publishing all at once for provoking a reorg. What does segwit has anything to do with it?


If people starts using different terminology for describing the same thing, then there will be incomprehension.
Given the history of publication by Peter Rizun, I think this is a deliberate attempt of [Argument by Gibberish]( (CSW like this one as well)
Does BIP141 use 'extension block' terminology anywhere? No? then just don't use it.
Shall we argue that P2SH is a form of extension block because the signature can be published separately from the redeem script?

There might have a way to be provably fair that does not involve address reuse.
They can publish a public HD pubkey. When a bet start, they would derive a random path to get a new Address. The bet happens, then if there is a fraud, the player would publish the HD path of the address involved.
Everybody would be able to verify that it is effectively derived from the public HD pubkey. would it work ?

One of the difference between a mixer and coinjoin, is that a coinjoin don't break the path, we can still follow your coin, even if it is harder to taint it. The more it is joined, the harder it is to follow. (ie, when you have your joined coin, there is a possibility to backtrack the joined coin to its owner by following the possible parents)
A mixer, on the other hand, can "break" the link between two coins.

Actually Bitcoin is easier to code than Ethereum for lots of things. The principal reason is that Ethereum infrastructure is almost none existent. (few libraries, few block explorer which can handle volume)
And building infrastructure is harder if the base is always moving and complex.
It all depends on what you intend to do.

my point is that when people say "Ethereum is more easy to code than bitcoin" I just say it is wrong. The reason is that comparing Solidity to Bitcoin script is like comparing their contracts to P2PKH.

* Right UX for interactions with the contract, 
* Backend which can create the ethereum transactions from the user's input correctly,
* Cold storage/Hot storage management,
* Key management (you'll likely need to integrate some hardware wallet depending on your case)
* How to secure oracle's data feed into a contract
Lot's of these stuff is easier to do in bitcoin as there is more libraries and infrastructure services. (like block explorers)
Ethereum IDE and solidity only take care of the contract part, which is equivalent to bitcoin scripts. As Bitcoin application developer we don't spend that much time on writing the bitcoin script, but more on what I enumerated above.
