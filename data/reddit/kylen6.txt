Would be a cool gift for my friend's birthday next tuesday as he's really into cryptocurrencies. ;)

Might depend on where you live but can't you just enter 1998 instead of 1999?

I know some sites to buy BTC underaged but it's not for your country, sorry.

Thanks for your comment.
2) Yes I do own as a stock, but I meant selling it now as it might lose value because of this fork (lose all value, not a slight drop) that was my main concern.
3) Okay, I only do BTC so I'll stick to it then.
4) I own less than 0,1 BTC at the moment so I think it's not really worth it to spend that much on a real wallet, right?

A friend told me about the crash and when it hit 5100, I thought it surely had to go up again. I'm not a big investor as I am busy with other things, it's more of a hobby for me. I was also never planning on investing a lot as I was already late in BTC (2016). Btw, I'm currently holding as I'm challenging myself to accept risks and this is just something I have to 'do' to improve myself. (:

To be exact, i own around $200 now. I get your point and I'd totally secure it on a Trezor if I had bigger funds but for now, I'm good, thanks for the advice anyway. I do have a small little problem, I was just checking all my account details and I'm logged in on the Blockchain app, but I forgot my password. If I enter the private key, it says it will create a new wallet ID. Does that mean I'm going to need a new account or will the login wallet ID just change?

I'd do it before but obviously nobody knows what will be the best decision in the long term.
