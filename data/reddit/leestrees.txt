I think we are going to see this very soon...the electronic scene IMO will be a breeding ground for btc...it seems the genre is already aligned with copy left, independent representation, and internet marketing..

It does!

Maybe infomercials have been carefully crafted to sound like satisfied customers..
*Nah* you're probably right

First off, cryptocurrency in general represents a huge paradigm shift from fiat currency. Cryptocurrency in general (I'll say most) allow for transparency in the macro sense and programmability in the micro world. Neither of these are achievable in fiat currencies without years of legislation and fundamental payment system changes. Most every crypto currency has these features; bitcoin was the first one to prove it is possible. 
How is this possible anyways?
1) Open source software: perhaps the most important feature of Bitcoin was that the software was created with an open source license. This simply means that any human can read, contribute to, or fork (create a copy and change the code without permission) the software proving transparency. Anyone who wants to can view the parameters of the protocol, (money supply, distribution mechanism, security features, etc) and, if not satisfied, can suggest changes to the protocol or even create their own coin by forking the software and changing the code to their liking. Its important to note that most crypto currencies are forks of bitcoin if you follow their lineage.
2) Extensive testing by community: when the Bitcoin protocol was created, bitcoins had no fiat price. Their value was absolutely zero. This allowed for an environment where early adopters could become familiar with the system, could attempt to break the Bitcoin protocol, and could decide if each bitcoin actually worked as a store of value. It was traded for over a year before programmers and economists actively involved in it indirectly spawned a monetary demand. The supply was huge, the demand was tiny, therefore Bitcoin had bitcoins that were almost worthless (at that time in a monetary sense). The only factor that changed over time was the daily increasing trust people had that the protocol could not be broken. This leads me to my last point.
3) Global mining pools (distributed security + monetary incentive): most people understand how the miners secure the network with computer power, specifically hashing functions. This computer power is global and decentralized. Any attack on the network would require more computing power today than could ever actually used against it. I don't want to go too far into how mining works here as there are many better resources than I on this subject. I will just say that the miners do work for selfish reasons (monetary incentive, bitcoin distribution). The system rewards the miners for being selfish and "selling" computer power to the network. The system punishes miners who grow too large (mining pools) and attempt to change the blockchain. In addition, there is no business with the power over Bitcoin to change it; only the collective community of users have that power. With no figurehead to attack and discredit, Bitcoin operates almost as an artificial intelligence similar to the internet. No one could "pull the plug" tomorrow, even an adversary with great funds and computing power. Because of these parameters, the network is secure and dynamic, growing or shrinking to meet the needs of the networks users. 
These are not all inclusive but I think if a cryptocurrency lacks any one of these 3 features, the crypto community should be weary at best of the promised results.

I chose those colors to represent the flag, thank your for asking because I didn't include that in the OP
Nice handle btw

Personal attacks aside,
You are correct, and plenty businesses will do that. "If it ain't broke don't fix it." The businesses that adapt to a changing market first will be rewarded.

That is true, they were skinned but we are in a transition period. We are implementing a sophisticated decentralized system in a currently centralized world. The weak points are in the businesses and business men that we have to trust. Had there been a decentralized exchange from the start, we wouldn't have had to learn to build one from the gox explosion. These men (and many more) will continue to scam and the free market will continue to prune and shape the environment we do business in. The free market isn't gentle but over time, it solves problems.

And we call it "treasure", all of them are related!

I love you &lt;3

As do I, thank you very much!

I suppose that reflects back on my flat imagination then. She created almost exactly what I had requested and I'm no artist...

Truth!  get your hot-off-the-presses truth right here!

Because businesses that refuse to accept bitcoin will soon be compared to businesses that refused to create a website. They will be wholeheartedly eclipsed
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:31:42
I think the most simple test would be to ask "what problem does this coin work to solve?" Bitcoin has quite a few innovative features which in turn, give it value.

Fuck yeah shapeshift!

I want to down vote you because you're a huge dick, but this comment is actually pretty damn funny. I'm torn.
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:24:56
Honestly I don't see what you really mean by all of this. I don't want to defend Andreas against any and all criticism but this concern seems a bit silly. 
No one is holding you back from understanding, using, spreading, or harnessing bitcoin. The fact that you are an exception to the rule doesn't make the rule less true. Andreas constantly talks about how he saw the internet blow up and become mainstream while many others around him (especially older established money who liked printing words on paper just fine) saw it as a den of porn and gambling. Today, with the internet, age is almost completely insignificant in understanding complex ideas. We all have an equal footing and access to information that young people have never had before. Those who are ignorant of bitcoins potential for disruption are choosing that ignorance (1) directly in the case of paid shills/trolls or (2) indirectly in the case of indoctrinated states worshipping citizens. 
If you see the power of disruption that these concepts unite, we are all on the same team.

We have a government because it imposes itself on its "jurisdiction." Don't fool yourself into believing we all merrily decided to get economically buttfucked by people that give orders to thugs with guns.

Its not impossible, but in your scenario, me and a couple friends (or me alone if I'm rich enough) could use our computers to create our own WU-coins or mess with other WU-coin transactions. The special property of bitcoin is that there is more computing power working for the system than could ever work against it. Bitcoin isn't perfect but its constantly evolving, faster than any one entity can stop.

Fresh off the press! Let us know what you think of it! 
8x10 acrylic and puffy paint on canvas.
Edit: it just wouldn't be if 50% of the comments weren't hateful! I am ecstatic about my gift and it will look great hanging up at work. Thanks for the few kind remarks everyone! Who knew we would be criticized for calling a painting art?!

I have a bit invested in loans right now as an experiment..I only have like 20$ invested across 20 loans and I'll be waiting quite a while before I know if I've been scammed or not. The problem is that even 2 people defaulting would pretty much destroy any profit i would have made. At this point, im hoping to get my original 20 back out. I love the functionality of the site but I have heard ugly things about all of these lending sites in general.
Edit: I think the lending sites will work better when we have a larger base of people requesting loans. Gotta start somewhere

I agree with your central message here that downvotes fly very easy in this subreddit.
However, one look at your post history shows why you might be down voted a lot. Criticism is one thing, ignorant cynicism is another.

This exact one is for me but she says she is open to making more
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:52:15
I like the discourse here, so I want to ask how familiar you are with technology? Obviously you know enough to have gotten into bitcoin. I'm not even trolling I'm just curious because I think society can work like that. 
Bitcoin rewards people working together, it gives us incentive not to skin sheep. I have it so good (relatively speaking) here in america but I want tomorrow to be an improvement for all people, not just Americans. We can make tomorrow better but we need to develop systems like bitcoin and on top of bitcoin that are tamper resistant. The floodgates have opened and crypto systems are evolving very fast thanks to group incentive and decentralized development.
