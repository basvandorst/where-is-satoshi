I'm not calling it stable yet, I'm only saying that the magnitude of large bitcoin events seems to be decreasing.

Amazon seem to appreciate direct customer feedback:
amazon.com -&gt; help -&gt; contact us
This is the reply I got when I said I want them to accept bitcoin:
"Hello Nick,

I have passed your message on to the appropriate department who will review your comments. Customer feedback such as yours helps us to continue improving the selection and service we provide. We appreciate the time you've taken to write to us."

Thanks!

The uptrend to 110% was the mtgox collapse as we are looking at a trailing 30 day window.  My point was that it could have been much worse when comparing it to previous large bitcoin events.

Fair question. I'd like to be able to pay for a meal with bitcoin and then leave without the restaurant worrying about double spend attacks or replace-by-fee.  What are your thoughts about solving that without a payment processor like bitpay?

Perhaps we could use shillings :-)

Thank you for pointing this out!  I have updated the calculation and graph.

Hi Gavin! Thanks for everything you have done for bitcoin! Do you see any way we could speed up block times?  For example halving difficulty as well as block rewards?

I vote for plan A.  It's future-proof and people definitely do their best math before the decimal point!

Most people don't know the SI prefixes and would probably find it more natural to go the other way and say 2 thousand bits or 5 million bits.

It would give bitcoin the possibility of becoming more popular without a cup of coffee costing 0.000001 units.

they reached a deal with Jed:
got 3 banks onboard (2 US and 1 in Germany):
and came out with a smart oracle system that can do crypto contracts:

I like it! How about growing the block size limit at the same rate as Internet download speeds:

Many design decision in Bitcoin are based on gold. The fixed supply coupled with speculative demand will cause periodic bubbles.  However,  the long-term trend will be price increases as long as people continue to use it.

No.  Ripple is for trading IOUs along trust lines, not moving counterparty-free assets like bitcoins.  It can help bitcoin by doing off-chain transactions and getting banks comfortable with blockchain technology.

That's a fair point. It's still good to know that there is an asset that a border guard can't steal from you should you ever have to flee your country without asking for help from a foreign government.

Buffett is a great investor but he broke his own rule of the "Circle of Competence" by commenting on Bitcoin:
“You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.” -Warren Buffett
I guess he is only human and sometimes has trouble sticking to his own rules :)

If we can't find a way to increase throughput via Segwit with Lightening and/or bigger blocks, bitcoin will be become more and more like digital gold: you won't be able to buy much with it and it'll cost a fortune to move it.

To feel even better try it in British Pounds!
