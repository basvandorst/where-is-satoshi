Haha fair point

Are you attempting a clever analogy wrt to the FED? Because I certainly hope not.

What? I clearly don’t get it either as fiat doesn’t either.

Not at all. People weren’t buying stocks in the ‘internet’ for a start! Bit more to the economy than Breton Woods so that is a bit of a non sequitur also.

The promise of bitcoin died the moment people started buying it as an investment. So all this revolution chat is ridiculously embarrassing.

That’s a truly awful comparison and doesn’t remotely work.

Again. People weren’t buying sticks in ‘the internet’. Is this really so difficult for you people to understand? The fundamental purpose of bitcoin is an alternative method of currency. When people are buying it for other purposes, undermining this core purpose, that breaks purpose. People buying stocks in .com companies isn’t remotely comparable. The internet’s purpose is not and never was tied to .com companies. 
This is basic financial history 101 people. I should be able to presume you know this if you are going to start talking about bitcoin disrupting the world and making empty references to Bretton Woods.

One of the new leaders of the desperately pathetic incel crowd. It would be funny if he wasn't open about taking advantage of the insecurities of these people.
