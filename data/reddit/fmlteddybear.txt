He's not, he asks many very relevant questions, which me myself also have. Stop  calling him a troll, just because he's right. There are many unsolved problems that really needs to be addressed, I don't see how people try to ignore them. Bitcoin can't scale, no other altcoin can. I don't understand how people can't see what a huge fucking problem that is. There is no way bitcoin can handle a billion people using bitcoin every day. Lightning hopefully can solve some problems, but there are still problems, which are important to discuss. We need to work together and solve this, for everyone sake and not hate on people rising questions that are very much relevant.
People seems to take it like an offense when someone questions the scaling problem. Why? Stop ignoring it and start discussing it instead.

You should consider donating to the Red Cross, I'm sure you have heard of it before. It seems that they take donations via bitpay.

Before the fork B1X is 100%, after the fork B1X is maybe 85% and B2X 15%. So whatever value B2X will have after the fork, B1X will go down. Meaning if B2X will be worth about 15% of B1X, B1X will go down 15%. In theory at least.

Bitstamp works great for me. Free withdraw and 0.25% buying fee.

Well, the fees are to high for buying anything below 100$. Which is a lot of things.

I use bitstamp, 0.25% fee. Free withdrawal and sepa deposit

How do I do this without loosing huge amounts in fees? Say I buy every day, I'll lose 7$ in fee every time I buy. Does exchanges solve this, by staying off chain or something?

When people start using bitcoin as you suggest, the fees will go up crazy. Not many people use bitcoin for groceries and so on, what happenes when 10000x people start paying with bitcoin daily? I'm not a fan of B2X, it's just stupid, doubling the block size isn't going to change a thing when a lot of people start paying with bitcoin. We need proper scaling abilities.
