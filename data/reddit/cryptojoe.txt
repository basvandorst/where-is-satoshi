Ledger is good too. I use both but I like trezor better. It’s more intuitive to use imho

Safest is to buy a trezor hardware wallet.  The cheaper one.  Then get a receive address from there, and paste it into the "send"  field of your bitcoin wallet on coinbase.  Then you own your keys.

If you go to [ then click "bitcoin" then "live,"  you can see when blocks are being confirmed.  Seems like there was a gap for over an hour between 585425 and the one after it. But then three confirmed pretty quickly.  So if you're waiting for six, you'll be there soon.

I thought trezor allows you to send with just one confirmation.

GreenAddress seems very secure.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:31:14
It’s all you need for secure storage.

Toggle "median time", so that you can see the first block with 12:20 UTC "Median Time".

The servers don't have to be in the US.  They just seized btc-e, which i doubt had servers in the U.S.

of course! Especially those exchanges that now have tokens that the Feds think are securities--eg., those connected to ICOs.  It's gonna get bloody unfortunately before it gets rosy.

Just hock the wedding jewelry and liquidate the children's college funds.  They'll thank you later. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:28:07
Yes, grasshopper.  Think about how many satoshi's you'll be hodling when people are counting in that denomination.

bcash netted at leat 10% upon launch.  I'm guessing people will be buying mad in the hours leading up to the fork in hopes of another profitable sketchy coin dump.

Shut up and take my money!
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:49:22

That's brilliant. so when some construction worker finds them he can have your bitcoin.  How bout keys in a place only you have access to? Like safety deposit box, and another copy in a safe? You know? Like secure.   Or your can put them in an encrypted volume and email to yourself---just make sure the password would take a trillion years to hack, obviously.

Cheapair.com might still accept btc, but i haven't used them in a while. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:14:08
No they're delaying my withdrawal.  Issued a warning after i withdrew that the withdraw may be delayed.  Wtf is that? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:20:03
Why aint you rich? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:37:37
why you still holdin'.  Didn't you get the memo bitch is crashing. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:15:13
Imma staying away from GDAX after they release my funds.  They're not even giving their clients their BCC when it splits on Aug 1.

For those of you closing your dwolla account, there are not many easy ways to get $ into your crypto-economy.  Money order straight to campBX is relatively cheap, as already mentioned.  Snapswap takes USD and deposits it into your ripple wallet without large fees, however, the snapswap-USD/BTC volume is still low on the ripple trade platform. Coinbase will link to your bank account but they will only sell you slightly overpriced bitcoins.   Did i miss any cheap gateways?
