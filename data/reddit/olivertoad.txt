Send the money to a BTC wallet address and it should send the currency as BTC.

No I like them, it lets me know when there is a significant price increase or drop without having to constantly check the price.

Is anyone else experiencing EXTREMELY slow confirmation times? I have a transaction over a day old that hasn't confirmed yet. I did not alter the transaction fee it is set to Electrum's default (never had a problem like this before). Has anyone had transactions confirmed in the last day? What could be my issue, coins were purchased through LBC.
Edit: my fee is set to .5 mBTC/KB this is a standard fee correct? What else could stop my transaction from confirming?

Thank you

Okay thank you. That's weird because I have been using the same fee for a different recent transaction (for a slightly larger amount) that went through fine. How do I update Electrum with an existing wallet? Will it just keep the wallet file and find it when I download a later version?

Could you explain what you mean here? What constitutes a third party wallet?
Are you referring to like an online 'wallet' or a downloadable blockchain.info wallet. Can downloadable wallets be considered third party? I have electrum downloaded on my Windows PC, what type of wallet is that?
