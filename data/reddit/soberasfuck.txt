Couldn’t you also use that to scam people? Tell them you sent their transaction but do so with an ultra low fee that won’t get confirmed, then send the coins to a different address with a higher fee?

This is very interesting, thanks for responding. I had no idea about the ASICBOOST exploit that Jihan had patented. That's pretty scummy. It sucks that both coins have become so centralized in the hands of just a few miners. 
How do you figure that it was Theymos who was handed the reins- wasn't Gavin *Andresen the one given control of the bitcoin repo? And I know he was behind BitcoinXT, but he stopped due to ddos attacks that were occurring on every node that ran the software. He said in a blog post that bitcoin cash was attempting to pick up where XT left off, which seems like support to me. But I suppose I misunderstood- you're right, support != it being his project. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:56:53
The mempool is consistently full, driving up fees to $10+ per transaction in order to get included in a block. This cannot be considered cheap when other traditional money transfer services offer lower fees. This was supposed to be one of the original purposes of bitcoin. The high fees results in people having dust in their wallets that they are unable to move because it would be financially impractical.

Price != value
I agree that bitcoin is undervalued. But as soon as the price goes parabolic, that’s a huge red flag that a correction is coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:21:02
Why isn't making blocks a bit bigger good enough? I think 8mb is overboard right now, but 4mb would solve a lot of the congestion- and fee-related problems we are having. It would be a lot simpler technically to implement than SegWit. Lightning is exciting but it is not ready yet.

@_date: 2017-12-04 10:46:24
I’m saying if you look at the price graph of bitcoin, literally every time the price goes parabolic, there is a large correction. Does this mean that bitcoin is worth any less fundamentally, or that 11k is not an accurate assessment of its value at this time? No. The parabolic price correction is just a pattern that has repeated itself over and over again. 
Bitcoin is worth a lot as a world-changing crypto currency and novel technology. But its price follows patterns. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:43
If those are the only reasons to use Bitcoin, there are 100+ other currencies out there that can do the same thing. What does Bitcoin do better than any other currency right now?

Core has shown themselves to be incapable of reacting when it comes to addressing critical, badly-needed updates to the protocol. Those other cryptocurrencies (well, the ones that aren't just pump-n-dump schemes) are addressing places where bitcoin either falls short, or things that bitcoin doesn't attempt to be used for.

How can you get your bitcoin gold out?
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:48:47
There are a lot of good calculations on r/financialindependence. One is to take your annual spending and multiply it by 25 to get the required size of your nest egg. Alternatively, multiply your savings by 4% to get the amount of money you can safely withdraw per year to see if you have a big enough amount. This assumes a 7% average market return. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:57:51
And perhaps Walmart would have a huge incentive to destroy roads leading to Target or any other of their competitors. Do you not see where that kind of reasoning leads?

The government doesn’t have “exclusive permission” to build roads. Have you never heard of private roads before? Is this concept new to you? They exist everywhere. Gated communities for example.

Merchant adoption has been stagnating for a while now. I don’t understand why more people aren’t upset by the inability to make small purchases with bitcoin anymore.

This is going to be an unpopular opinion here in the land of libertarians, but I think paying taxes is important, and people trying to cheat the system should be punished. I don't think wealthy people should be able to screw the rest of us by using tax loopholes to get out of paying for important public services. 
Sure, it sucks that our tax money goes towards things we might view as unimportant, but it also goes towards things like maintaining roads and infrastructure that we all rely on. Fuck people who try to get out of paying their fair share.
