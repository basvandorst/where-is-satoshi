Right. Although skyscrapers look straight, the internal structure is more like a pyramid, thicker beams being at the bottom vs the top. Makes sense that they would collapse straight down rather than fall sideways like it was made of Lego.

Likely people were saying building 7 was damaged and it was misreported as building 7 collapsed. I remember them reporting the Washington monument had collapsed too.

I'm still at the point where it pisses me off. I look at my charts, roll my eyes and think "ok who's whining this time?"

Retailers aren't the problem. Card manufacturers are selling their entire output directly to the big server farms. Nvidia needs to be putting pressure on its manufacturing partners, not blaming Amazon and Newegg.

She's a technology idiot. Not long ago she wanted to put back doors in all forms of encryption, effectively breaking all forms of e-commerce, online banking and anything else that uses an SSL certificate.
She also gets wet for anything Orwellian. She's the one who introduced the Investigatory Powers Act, which gave the tax office, unemployment office, food standards agency and the frickin Welsh Ambulance Service of all things, access to anyone's internet history via their ISP records.
I'd rather have Donald Trump regulating the internet. Atleast he can use Twitter!

You mean XRP ? I have a bit in that, it seems to be the only crypto that goes up during times when all the others go down.

Wasn't this same story posted a few days ago?

I don't have any USD, but how about 1 USD worth of BTC in exchange for 1 BTC?

How about a passport?

They should call the fork "bitcoin cash" and insist on calling the original "bitcoin cash core".

Except the "from" address is spoofed, so you'll end up sending the vid of you jerking off to some old grandma. Though it would be funny if she replied asking for more.

So sell now, buy back in at 5k?

Hong Kong is part of China now. China has given it some level of autonomy since the British left, but they could easily impose their will on the province when it's in their interests to do so.

This makes no sense to me...
A piece of paper is insecure use this USB device instead. Ok.
USB device can be lost, stolen, eaten by dog, so you need a separate "recovery phrase". 
Store recovery phrase on a piece of paper. Wait what?
