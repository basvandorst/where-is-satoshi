| BTC-e
I'm sorry bro, your coins are not getting returned, there's been thousand of stolen coins that have ended up to BTC-e and have never been returned. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:54:17
Well Bitcoin is very exciting, no one can blame you for getting emotional over it.
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:29:14
50,000 ?
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:47:58
But can you buy Bitcoin by sms?
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:42:23
Well you can always speculate.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:37:19
Just use a mixer service, it's that simple. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:14:18
Because it's easier to invest in Bitcoin than some stock. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:21:17
Wont be surprised if it breaks $2k, you've already got Bill Gates talking about, the avalanche is coming.
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:53:20
A war in Ukraine is breaking out soon, with a crashing ruble I can see people turning to bitcoin really fast to avoid hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:51:47
amen brother
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:21:48
Yeah that was nasty, but MS was controlling the install platform so it was able to kill it. Thanks to globalazation if one Govt kills it another Govt profits. Think about how countries like Switzerland profit from the bank sector.
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:08:06
Learn about their fees first.

The api section details how transactions work and that it's up to the programmer if he wants to use 0 confirmation transactions. 
For example you could use 0 confirmation transactions between two trusted networks you have control.
Or for a client you trust and has credit on your business and you can afford to trust him and don't want to have him wait for confirmations.

Let's do this!
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:29:22
There are no flaws except the human factor.
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:35:11
Wonder if Devil Bill is investing in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:12:47
Probly if they want to stay at top of their game.
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:12:48
what's weird about it? I'm just commenting on a market change, I don't see how this is any weird? You're weird.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:34:55
Because someone is buying.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:31:15
M00N BABE!
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:09:58
It's either gonna fail or take over the world.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:35:52
Looks like your Tails system is full of security holes brother
 with a bunch of them for its native browser.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:36:14
yes and no
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:46:01
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:01:12
Nice, about time.
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:39:29
I like Buffet, he's a pragmatist not really known for investing in technology/start-ups  but rather established companies like Coca Cola, he wont invest in Bitcoin till he sees some concrete proof that it is working.
Isn't he best friends with Bill Gates, he definitely has some kind of perspective on this, so who knows.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:03:57
The Xmas Bull is here babe, MEWWWWW!!!
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:37:38
what the future hodls?
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:17:43
There are more people willing to sell at a lower price than buy higher.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:21:20
Christmas came early again.
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:48:49
Apple Pay is just a medium, I don't see any reason why they can't add Bitcoin support into their system. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:08:54
That's cool brother, but this is , you're looking for but something tells me you already know that.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:24:58
Good job man, the first 100 if the hardest one.
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:12:40
History always repeats itself.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:04:33
2% maybe more?
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:25:10
He bought a Tesla? Eco friendly I see.
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:40:52
Happy NEW YEAR EVERBODY!

@_date: 2014-11-26 22:13:14
Congratulations Mark !

|  He thinks that the upside is "astronomical" compared to the downside. 
Interstellar drive here we go!
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:24:06
Doesn't matter. blockchain.info is already the most popular site, I doubt they need to be listed on bitcoin.org anymore.
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:05:24
they already issued a sell call in case you've missed
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:30:56
All hail Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:01:18
Now we wait.
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:53:18
Sure, as long at it stabilizes so I can use it with more ease.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:51:30
Marc's a smart dude.
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:22:02
Does this mean that the Electrum Wallet may have been hacked?
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:06:31
You can't.
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:41:40
your fee it too low
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:34:11
GOTTA CATCH THEM ALL!
HAIL BITCOIN!
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:04:42
let's hope so ;)
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:03:06
1)You put a short
2)Then start shilling that the sky is falling on bitcoin forums and subreddits
It's simple economics.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:10:15
Until it get a wider adoption the fluctuation will continue, it will have to reach like an above $5-10k price for the fluctuation to decrease.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:54:02
It's not a security flaw, it's up to the programmer to decide which way he wants to use it.
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:20:41
Sure why not.
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:07:42
Cutting out the middle men from my transactions mainly.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:01:39
Someone had written a report in the summer, posted on pastebin, I remember reading that , probably the main reason I haven't used it yet.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:01:43
Not till &lt; $100
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:54:27
Pump it again Sam.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:17:51
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:12:08
He already cashed out long ago, so should you?
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:38:26
It's going to double digits m8.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:18:24
Only 2000? I thought he'd buy more if he considered $200 as cheap coins.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:57:30
Sure, those charts are showing how good Bitcoin is doing inside the current user base, not that Bitcoin is expanding and getting new people to use it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:52:26
1 BTC today = 2 BTC tommorow ?
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:41:04
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:47:44
Increasing supply with diminishing demand.
You can expect a rise in price when the supply starts decreasing.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:00:05
Sure but   wouldn't you agree that the price is a reflection 
of how good Bitcoin is doing and expanding?
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:06:31
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:07:34
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:52:23
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:32:01
blockchain.info is for people that know how to use a Computer.
The rest are for people that use Mac and Ibads.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:58:40
I exited at $260m maybe re enter at $210, will see.
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:46:37
I think the inordinate amount of scums popping up every day are keeping people away. 90% of news every day is about some scummer.
Just take a look at this sub-reddit the mods are always absent and let everything turn into circlejerk while they are profiting.
The community has to migrate to a healthy sub-reddit one of the likes of bitcoinmarkets were the mods are active.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:25:56
Sure, but what good is it if MS is adopting Bitcoin 
but people are not using it.
Price going up means more demand, simple as that.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:59:38
Yeah I think teenage angst is kinda ruining this place.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:09:35
No why?
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:51:38
Did you use those stolen credentials to log in to the site( be it fake or not)? Doesn't that constitute a crime on its own?
So that makes you a criminal?
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:41:30
But Eastern Europe is where Bitcoin thrives to this day since its inception. If it wasn't for Eastern Europe Bitcoin would still worth $7-10.
And yes that's the Mafia I'm referring too. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:03:28
sold all of it at $302, took a decent profit.
looking at buying at sub $200, will see
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:36:57
It still falls under identity theft crimes.
