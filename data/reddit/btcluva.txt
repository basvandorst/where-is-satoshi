Every time you sell that's another loaf of bread some family in Venezuela or Zimbabwe will not be able to buy.  If you sold BTC in 2017 then pay your capital gains and be gone!  If you held then please deduct your appreciation from your income taxes and count it as a charitable donation.

I argue that the 200sma of BTC is more fairly valued and more safe than anything in the stock or bond market. Regulations and government backing delays the bubble burst while inflating it and then delays the recovery with new regulations after it pops.

Come on man patience. Gold has had 6k years and the usd 200+ for people to comprehend it's value. BTC 9 years... Do you find that using BTC personally is preferable over Banks and fiat? I do hands down. No weekends no holidays no rules about where I can/can't send it, same day delivery... People who used Amazon early saw the advantage and held the stock.

Corruption only happens when people have the power of coercion. Socialism requires the elimination of freedom, centralization of power, and thus the opportunity for corruption. A government who's only role is the prosecution of aggression will ensure the least possible corruption.

Welcome to the world of finance! It's all for profit... Except Bitcoin brings freedom so the poor Nigerian Street vendor can reach for profit and asset protection in the same ways those of us in the West have for decades. Sure dimon has more access now but I would argue as this grows more decentralized so will his reach and ability to restrict.

Or another Cyprus decides to lock down all citizens bank accounts and give them a haircut... What I love about BTC is that we are hoping the algorithm doesn't fail whereas Fiat world is hoping their leaders don't do something dumb. Guess where my money is?

That's wrong. So if the world doesn't come apart crypto goes nowhere? It is the future good or bad
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:57:56
The reason there have been bank runs are because people feel the bank won't give them thier money.  This why Bitcoin was invented. You can and should always be in control of your Bitcoin. That is why I firmly believe jp Morgan will go to zero before Bitcoin.

No sideways is great! It signals stability and big players can actually use it to transfer wealth... Which leads to price appreciation eventually

Hell I'm trying to manipulate the price as hard as I can in my favor by not selling any of my BTC. Isn't everyone trying to do the same?

That's why I love you man... And crypto! It will never return to what you or I want it to be. It is a million different things to a million different people: currency, store of value, hype, bubble, freedom fighter bazooka, etc. No authority can ever change that.

There are two differences. 1 aol and Yahoo were not dependent on any network effect. You could easily choose switch email addresses to Google without any loss of connectivity.  2. Most users had no financial incentive to remain with aol and Yahoo.  Not saying it won't happen but it would be a much greater feat than simply releasing a better email/search service.

I was thinking about this problem as well. What about placing your seed phrase for your big savings somewhere that would take you several hours to get to? That way the thieves would basically have to escort you a long way away to get your primary funds... Which would dramatically increase their risk...
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:30:21
I love price manipulation in an unregulated market because it creates opportunity for everyone. Pretty soon price manipulators compete against each other and we get a fair price. I am against price manipulation with public funds or regulation.

Sure but how much? No one knows so if you believe in the tech and your not selling for at least a year just but at regular intervals. That said 9k seems pretty good historically... What are you going for 8k again?

If you can't handle to risks freedom brings don't invest in crypto. There are plenty of heavily "protected"/ regulated markets to invest in. We're all trying to manipulate the price in our favor. You want to ban the short sellers to manipulate the price to go your direction. What will you say when DEX use proliferates?
