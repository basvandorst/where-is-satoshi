Hire a wills, trusts, estates lawyer. You can do it a bunch of ways.

Only put in money you can afford to lose, and only put in money if you believe in Bitcoin.

Get what, ya spicy meatball stalking old posts?

Whatever dude good luck catching the falling knife if it even falls at all I hope it works out
@_date: 2019-10-29 00:37:26
Could be very realistic possibility 
But what about sideways? Also maybe
I predict one of these three. Y’all just wait
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:53:07
I don’t care about charts, and I hope it does keep going up. But that’s your house money dawg. It is yours though. I share your optimism!
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:06:58
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:53:52
Better stop using fiat
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:50:04
Maybe, but we can quantum proof bitcoin. I’m not worried about quantum computing.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:41:44
Those are dope things though bro
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:43:50
That’s the point of gold though. It’s a store of value not an investment. It just depends on what you’re trying to do, right?
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:46:39
No, and Xi is a piece of shit.

Still got a bit more time in EST. Let’s go!
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:48:39
Why is Zucc relevant? Also chill out bitcoin is volatile. These types of swings happen, and they’re noise. Don’t listen to the noise.
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:20:54
I understand you’re upset but I think just calling them is going to be a lot less painful. Call them from a burner or something if you don’t want them to have your phone number.
@_date: 2019-10-07 22:13:01
Dude how much cocaine did you rail before you posted this nonsense? Take care of yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:42:13
Pretty straight forward. He knows the prophecy meme. He saw bitcoin spiking. He posted the meme.

Every single price movement brings this question lol. Nobody knows the future; you guess based on whatever you think is important.

If we hard fork and abandon the old chain, what’s the possible total fiasco scenario? 
Edit: Is it just that maybe some people want to use a chain that’s vulnerable to quantum computing and don’t switch to the new one? I don’t see that as likely.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:52:08
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:11:40
Smells like wild speculation to me.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:18:09
Possible via a fork, no?
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:20:27
Xi (China) is literally holding people in concentration camps and farming organs. I understand you’re just joking around though.
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:43:54
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:23:26
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:46:59
Maybe it’s irrelevant. Correlation is not causation.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:16:33
I think he comes across as pretty genuine here, which I appreciate. That is, he may not understand the tech very well but he understands the significance of cryptocurrency in the socio-political context.
@_date: 2019-10-29 00:38:52
Then you need to sacrifice an animal to Odin to avoid consequences
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:49:16
Uhh I’d say the other way around is more likely. But what do I know
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:50:51
Because it’s undervalued!
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:18:59
Im fine with that
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:55:19
Lol, have an upvote
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:25:59
F. But it’s still undervalued.
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:57:16
Went down then went up and then back down a little and here we are
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:52:40
Still a good time to buy though!
Edit: Still lookin good
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:57:27
Smh, then that’s what happens, and the world keeps on spinning. No, it’s good a bunch of pedophiles got stopped. The public ledger enabled them to be caught. That’s a win for bitcoin. It’s sending bad people to prison. Fiat cash would have let them fall through the cracks and get away. I think bitcoin is going rise long term because it kills banking, and it’s not seizable (if you’re smart with it), not censorable (also if you’re smart with it), and not debasable.

Diversity tends to lower risk, which is either bad or good depending on your goals. Risk comes with greater upside potential and greater downside potential. Pick your poison.
If you want some precious metals, it’s easy to get started. Go to your LCS or favorite online store and grab a couple coins, rounds, or bars and hold on to them somewhere safe. The wonderful news about gold and silver is they’re pretty safe stores of value.
@_date: 2019-10-19 16:53:16
I mean, gold did all right. I’m not sure why you’re mad at it. Gold is still a solid store of value.
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:13:41
I mean, okay:  You trying to come with?
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:57:40
Bitcoin gonna rain on all their parades
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:52:33
Maybe nah
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:58:56
China is not the biggest promoter. Do you have any idea how many times they’ve tried to ban bitcoin? Also, your moral argument is so stupid I’m not even going to address it. Stop posting FUD.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:11:30
Could go up could go down. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:20:54
No u
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:49:46
Still a steal of a price!
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:54:56
This guy has posted multiple times since the spike. I think over multiple accounts as well. He’s just spreading FUD, and he’s not even good at it because he’s pretty bad at logical reasoning.
