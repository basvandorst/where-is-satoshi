Unfortunately combining the signatures is still an interactive process, so if you want to do coinjoin, you have to actively communicate with the participants.
I imagine that if signatures could be passively combined by the miner, you could end up with one signature per block with some clever programming.
Anyway, that's just wishful thinking. Schnorr is still a huge boon to scaling made possible by segwit.

You are misinterpreting it. To clarify, they are comparing old style Confidential Transactions vs. bulletproofs for the UTXO set. Either way, adding CT will **increase the UTXO set size**.
- UTXO set without CT: 3GB
- With old style CT: 160GB
- With bullet proofs: 17GB

I read the paper, but I missed this distinction. This improved my understanding. Thanks for pointing it out :)
I know it's not considered safe enough, but I'd love to hear whether there have been any developments regarding BLS signatures. Non-interactive signature aggregation would be amazing.

The literal fork in the bitcoin made me laugh.
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:11:18
I see your point. If they try to spend a SW transaction (since it looks to them like anyone can spend it), their block would be invalid anyway. But miners who do not upgrade can still create valid blocks by mining safe old style transactions or getting lucky that the SW transactions they mine are all valid and the miner doesn't try to spend them.
I find it hard to see the benefit of a soft fork over a hard fork if the miners who did not upgrade literally have no role anymore whatsoever (specifically in this case, where the hard fork also remains SPV compatible).

I think the argument for block size increase is well understood by everyone. I've been reading the many posts by Greg Maxwell (to understand the other side of the argument and this is what I got:
- Hard forks without full consensus should be avoided: the minority gets coerced.
- Soft fork solutions to problems are good, because they are fully backward compatible.
- One way the block size issue can be solved without a hard fork are sidechains.
- Sidechains allow you to choose which chain to place your bitcoins in, so everyone is happy.
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:42:47
Thanks Luke, I think I get it now. Please let me know if the following statement is correct:
- Once the SW soft fork gets activated, miners that haven't upgraded will likely get their block rejected if they create a block close to 1 MB (since any mined SW transactions will be pushing them over the limit).
I guess that's one slight downside to not having a separate limit.

Technical question. What is the reason for making the witness data count towards the 1 MB limit? Why is that important?
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:10:20


If the goal is to create a single digital currency for everyone, there will always be an unhappy minority. The current choice is: do we make the majority unhappy or the minority?


A bit hyperbolic in my opinion. A majority does not equal a central authority.


I find it hard to believe 100% consensus will be reached on issues that are not clear bugs. This essentially means giving the minority what they want.
The issue boils down to this: we currently have a system where either the minority or the majority is unhappy. This shows exactly why we need side chains. A single asset (bitcoin) with the freedom to choose which chain to place the asset in. Both the minority and majority can coexist.
However we do not have side chains at the moment, and there is no guarantee it will ever make its way into bitcoin (although I am optimistic). This means there is currently NO solution. So until then, what do we do? Do we give the majority what they want, or the minority? The choice is [not ideal]( but it is the only choice we currently have.

Are you referring to the use of a federated peg or is there some other way to avoid a hard fork?
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:25:15
I absolutely agree sidechains are a great solution and I can't wait to see it deployed. Your contributions to bitcoin are invaluable in my eyes. I do have two things I worry about, and wonder what you have to say about them:
- Sidechains aren't ready yet, and I am not convinced they will be ready before we start having block size issues. Shouldn't we make a (admittedly sub-optimal) choice now, rather than wait indefinitely for the perfect solution?
- Just like the current block size proposal, there may be a minority that doesn't want sidechains (e.g. saying a hard fork is too risky). What makes you think we can reach 100% consensus on this?

**Trying out the first South Korean Bitcoin ATM**
Today the first South Korean Bitcoin ATM was placed into cafe Coffee Sedona, located in the basement of the COEX Mall. It is a bit difficult to find—you have to go past Outback Steakhouse and Bulgogi Brothers to get there. Bitcoin ATMs allow you to independently buy and sell Bitcoins for cash.
I arrived before 2 PM and reporters were already lined up taking pictures of the machine. Evelyn Chung, director of Coinplug, was standing in front of it. In the afternoon there were only press and staff members. I did not see anyone who was there to simply use the Bitcoin ATM.
The Coinplug Bitcoin ATM is the first Bitcoin ATM that has been fully created in South Korea. Nautilus Hyosung (a Korean ATM company) is responsible for the exterior design, while Coinplug created the interior payment module. In comparison, the ATMs from HanaPay and Bitcoin Asia were built and imported from outside of the country. The ATM transactions are processed through Coinplug’s own exchange. There are no USD/KRW conversion fees.
I asked Evelyn Chung what motivated Coinplug to install the ATM. She explained that Coinplug wanted to create a place where people can easily experience how Bitcoin can be used as money.
Evelyn went on to explain that Bitcoin is not very useful yet because there are not many places that let you use it. They hope to create a central location—similar to New York’s Bitcoin Center—where people who are interested in Bitcoin can gather and talk.
In order to reach their goals, the fees were kept under 1%. Deposits or withdrawals will be charged with a Bitcoin fee of around 0.7 to 0.8%. The world’s first Bitcoin ATM—a Robocoin machine located in Canada—charges 3%.
The limit is set to three transactions of 300,000 KRW (approximately 280 USD) per day.
*[Picture showing Ryan Uhr, CEO of Coinplug]*
Ryan Uhr, CEO of Coinplug, anticipates that the Bitcoin ATM won’t be making them any money. He explained that most of their efforts will go into online payment systems. Coinplug intends to make it possible for you to pay online with Bitcoin—just like you would by credit card or bank deposit—in order to buy goods in online stores.
Once the press attention died down, I tried out the Bitcoin ATM and made a video of the process.
*[Video showing the Bitcoin ATM in action]*
It was very easy to buy and sell Bitcoin with the machine. There were no burdensome procedures like having to verify your identity. However, since the machine was only just installed, there were some minor issues. I also ran into a problem during my use. When I tried to use the Blockchain Wallet, the machine took my money and only showed an error message. Jay Hong, CTO of Coinplug, explained that this was related to the technique used in the QR code of the Blockchain Wallet. He lent me his Android Wallet so I could proceed with the transaction. Since Jay witnessed the issue and said it will be fixed shortly, I assume this will be resolved soon.
In order to avoid problems from occurring over the weekend, the Bitcoin ATM won’t be available to the public until March 10 at 11 AM. During the first two weeks, a Coinplug staff member will always be present to explain the process and help with any possible issues. To achieve this, the ATM will only be operational until 7 PM.
*End translation*
**A couple of side notes:**
- I'm not a native speaker of Korean, but it should be pretty accurate.
- I know the people from Coinplug. This is my way of thanking them for showing me around their office.
- Me and a friend run a frequent [Bitcoin meetup in Seoul]( 
Also, this is my first post ever. Hi! :)
**TL;DR:** First fully Korean Coinplug Bitcoin ATM installed in Seoul (COEX Mall, Coffee Sedona). Allows both withdrawal and deposit in KRW. Low fees, under 1%. No ID required. Limited to 3 transactions of 300,000 KRW (~280 USD) per day. Usable from 11 AM to 7 PM starting Monday.

In that case all is well. I'd hate to only focus on the negative, so let me also say I really like the Mycelium wallet. It is clear a lot of thought went into its design and it will continue to be my wallet of choice. Congrats on the 2.0 release.

I'm not fully informed, but from what I understand Bitonic is trying to start an exchange that has full government approval. Having bitcoin be recognized as money helps them with this process and may help start-ups that may face similar issues in the future. They want clarity from a regulatory perspective.
Opponents of this plan think that labeling bitcoin as money will increase regulation and stifle innovation (similar to the NYC bit license).
One of the core issues is that Bitonic is going to be representing the Dutch bitcoin community in court, while a large part of that same community disagrees with their stance.

The Sunday meetup in Sedona is the more popular one. We've only done it twice so far, but always ended up with a decent group of 8 to 10 people. We actually also meet up almost every day in Sinchon (usually only 3 people). The next Sinchon meetup hasn't been scheduled yet, but it will probably take place on Tuesday 11:30am.

That is a problem. As the update hits, it becomes impossible for anyone to backup old keys. Sending the bitcoins to an HD address is not good enough. What if you made the key publicly known and people send bitcoins to it from time to time (e.g. donations), but you haven't made a backup yet?

I'm afraid that I had to read a bunch of posts on different forums to get an accurate idea of nlocktime. Knowing how hard it was to get this info was what motivated me to post it in the first place. Here's one link that might be useful: 
It doesn't directly describe nlocktime, but it does give some examples of how it can be used. If you have any specific questions feel free to message me.
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:29:40
Nlocktime in a nutshell:
* You can add nlocktime to any type of transaction.
* The transaction will get rejected by the block chain until the time has passed and the transaction 'unlocks'.
* If you spend the coins before the transaction unlocks, the nlocktime transaction will become invalid (like trying to double spend).
* Nlocktime is generally used to ensure that you can get your money back, before sending it to a multisig address. However, there is a problem:
* Transaction malleability currently prevents us from doing this reliably. An nlocktime transaction won't be valid if the transaction it refers to gets malleated.
* Nlocktime + multisig allows for instant micro transactions without a fee. You can read my two posts explaining it [here](

Please tell me if I am understanding this correctly:
- Since it uses Neutrino, this means it can only connect to Neutrino full nodes (there must not be many out there?)
- It connects to multiple  nodes, not just one
- If all these nodes lie, I can potentially fail to notice when someone closes a prior state (note that I don't have a problem with this security assumption)
- Neutrino downloads the entire block whenever it detects a transaction that is relevant to one of its addresses (both checking/savings accounts)
I assume there isn't a wifi only mode. How bandwidth intensive is this wallet?

Thank you, Andreas. I tested it out and exporting the key works like it should. There were no steps on how to verify if my backup succeeded, but I was able to use the quick scan button to decrypt the private key. Mycelium did not inform me that this key is currently in my wallet (perhaps this should be the case), but by looking at the public key I was able to verify that it was indeed the same key.
You guys did a great job with the wallet. I often recommend it to people at our [Seoul Bitcoin Meetup](  We also ordered a Mycelium Entropy and are looking forward to testing it out. If you happen to go to the [Inside Bitcoins Seoul Conference]( in December, let me know.

Funny, I literally made this same mistake :)
@_date: 2014-10-11 14:20:55
Why speeding up block confirmation is not as important as you may think:
- A transaction with one confirmation still has a chance to get double spent if the block gets orphaned.
- A block with double the confirmation speed (i.e. 5 minutes), has double the likeliness of being orphaned and is only half as secure (i.e. the hashing power that went into it is only half as much).
- As mentioned, unconfirmed transactions can be spent (but not all wallets allow it), and this chain of unspent transactions can be confirmed by the block chain in a single block.
- You can look at transaction propagation to decrease the likeliness of a double spend. An instant attempt to double spend would cause about 50% propagation, instead of the expected 90+%.
- Services like greenaddress.it solve the double spending issue with 2-of-2 multisig. Greenaddress promises they will only sign transactions that are not attempts to double spend.
- You can also create a 2-of-2 transaction between buyer and seller, if you prefer not to trust a third party.
TL;DR The advantages of 'speeding up' the network are trivial, and solutions already exist.

Yeah, it's essentially the same setup as a micropayment channel and would allow for instant payment (assuming you set things in motion before actually meeting).
Double spends are one of those concerns that make people uncomfortable with bitcoin. Realistically I don't think anyone has to worry about double spends with Mycelium Local Trader, but the fact that it could theoretically happen is enough to keep many people away from it.

I believe the priority system is not implemented and likely never will be. The currently implementation (i.e. nLockTime transactions get rejected until valid) achieves the same goals.
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:00:21
Thank you for your comprehensive answer. It addresses most of my questions. If you don't mind, I have one more for you:
Wouldn't it technically be possible to have the nlocktime transaction be sent to the user before they finalize a new transaction? This would ensure that the greenaddress could never hold my money hostage by suddenly refusing to create an nlocktime transaction + refusing to sign anything.
* I create a transaction, and let greenaddress sign it first.
* I then sign it (making the transaction valid), and create an nlocktime transaction that refers to it.
* I withhold the transaction from the network until greenaddress signs the new nlocktime transaction and sends it to me.
Finally, I thought I would mention I can't get Google Authenticator 2FA to work. Whatever I do, it does not accept the code from GA. In my experience user error is usually the issue, so I'm probably just doing something wrong, but I've tried various times now without success. 
I also ran into a bug yesterday, being unable to re-enable my account after nlocktime expired, but it seems you already fixed it.

You could take the passphrase and cut it in three parts in such a way that you only need 2 of 3. For the sake of simplicity, let's say your passphrase is one two three four five six:
1. one two three four X X
2. X X three four five six
3. one two X X five six
X represents a missing word. Thanks to the added redundancy you only need 2 of the 3 parts. Note that it does become easier to bruteforce the passphrase this way. At the very least you should move your coins if you ever lose one of the three parts.
Edit: It's unfortunate that this got downvoted. Trezor has a 12-word passphrase, meaning each part is missing 4 words if you divide it into 3 parts. This is as safe as the famous [correct horse battery staple]( and is a quick and easy alternative to simply writing your entire passphrase on a piece of paper. It can still be bruteforced, but you should have enough time to move your money if you ever lose one of the parts.

Perhaps my choice of words wasn't the best. On a per-block basis the chances are nearly equal. It's just that twice as many blocks are created in the same span of time, so naturally there will be twice as many orphans.


Yes it is. That's the fundamental security model of the block chain. Every confirmation adds another 10 minutes worth of hashing power to your transaction security. The more confirmations, the less likely it becomes that this transaction ever gets reverted.
Most exchanges wait for six confirmations to be absolutely sure nobody can undo the transaction. If you half the block time, these same exchanges will now have to wait for twelve confirmations to get the same security they desire.

If you're really paranoid, you could pay in steps. Let's say Bob is buying three bitcoins from Alice for $1500 total. They set up the 2-of-2 transaction and meet:
* Bob hands over $500
* Alice signs and sends Bob a transaction that states 1 bitcoin goes to Bob, and the remaining 2 bitcoins go back to Alice.
* The first two steps get repeated: Bob hands over another $500, and Alice repeats the previous step, but now with 2 bitcoins to Bob and 1 back to Alice etc.
* Once they're done trading, the final transaction that Alice sent to Bob will be signed by Bob and sent to the network.
Notice how the network only has to process one transaction. This is essentially how micro transactions can work over the bitcoin network. Transactions can be as tiny as you want, and you only pay the transaction fee once.
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:42:07
~~just gave you your answer. I'll try to explain why it works:~~
- ~~A p2sh transaction doesn't contain the output script, just a hash of it.~~
- ~~This means the network cannot know how the transaction will be unlocked, and it will simply always be accepted into the block chain.~~
- ~~When you try to spend the coins, you have to provide the output script. This transaction will be rejected unless the lock time has expired.~~
- ~~In other words: this allows you to send your coins to an address, while being unable to get them out until the time has expired.~~
~~Edit: For the record, this does not require multisig. You can do this 100% by yourself.~~
Edit2: Alas, my theory seems to be incorrect. I mistakenly assumed nLockTime was part of the output. It is not, so I no longer believe this works. Let my mistake be forever engraved onto the history of the internet.

@_date: 2014-04-17 02:35:01
Sure, it's basically [this idea]( but with a single transaction. I'll try to explain in simple terms.
Let's say Bob agrees to buy coins from Alice and they are on their way to meet each other.
* Alice creates a transaction that promises to sends coins to an address that requires a signature from both Alice and Bob to unlock (2-of-2).
* Before Alice publishes the transaction, she asks Bob to sign a transaction that promises the coins will be sent back to Alice after a set period of time has expired (nlocktime).
* Alice is now certain that she can get her coins back after the time expires and locks her funds by sending the 2-of-2 transaction to the network.
* They meet up. Assuming it took them more than 10 minutes to meet, the 2-of-2 transaction has already been confirmed by the network.
* Bob hands Alice the money and they both sign a transaction that sends the coins from the 2-of-2 transaction to Bob.
* At this point they are done! Bob is certain that Alice cannot double spend the coins on her own (as long as nlocktime has not expired yet), since he has to sign any transaction that attempts to move the money. No waiting required.
Some things you may not know about nlocktime:
* An nlocktime transaction does not get accepted into the block chain until after its time lock has expired.
* Once the money from the 2-of-2 transaction gets moved, the nlocktime transaction becomes invalid and will never get accepted into the block chain, since the transaction it was pointing to has been spent.
Hope this explains it in an easy way. I believe it's concepts like these that will shape the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-02 04:36:01
have you thought about the interaction with p2sh? If you create a p2sh address, the bitcoins that get sent to it cannot be spent until the defined time expires. This allows you to securely and provably store received bitcoins for later use.

People with power doing everything in their power to make a hard fork happen only makes it more contentious.
Certain people are resisting a less contentious proposal (soft fork) for the sole purpose of pushing their preferred but more contentious proposal (hard fork). If you have good arguments, you can make your case for it in a civil manner, but at some point you gotta accept that the majority doesn't share your opinion and respect that instead of resorting to all-or-nothing destructive behavior.
At least that is how I interpreted what Adam said:

* The buyer does not have to wait for confirmations - our revolutionary transaction confidence graph provides additional feedback on whether the transaction will in fact go through.
I believe [bitundo]( showed us today that these kind of unconfirmed transactions are not safe.
I would really like it if Mycelium allowed me to temporarily lock my bitcoins in a 2-of-2 transaction with a potential buyer (of course with nlocktime back to myself) so the network can start confirming the transaction before we even meet.
@_date: 2014-10-12 06:10:13


This is the same concept as greenaddress without a middleman. Instead of giving the 2nd signature signing right to greenaddress, you can give it to the seller (e.g. before checkout, when you enter the shop).


Blocks get orphaned when two miners find a block at the same time. The more often the network is required to find a block, the more likely it is that this happens.
I'm not sure how to make hashing power halving more clear. The way you double the block discovery rate is literally by halving the required hashing power to make a block - blocks are found twice as fast, but each block is only half as secure.

Hey moral_agent, I have read a lot of your posts in the past, including your recent proposal about sending transactions to specific miners. You've had a lot of creative ideas, even back in the "bubble watch" days, haha.
The mining fee is basically a payment for the work they perform on your transaction, so from that perspective it would make sense if you could pick who performs the work for you. As long as the block reward is significantly higher than the fees I'm unsure if it will have enough impact, though.
I also wonder about the consequences if it means there will be discrepancies in the mempool, since a lot of the fast relay techniques rely on having a similar mempool.

Hey, I'm the founder of the [Seoul Bitcoin Meetup](
We went from 2 to 120 members in 4 months. Since I walked the path you are about to walk, perhaps I can give you some tips:
- Don't wait for people to sign up, just make a schedule and stick to it, even if in the beginning almost nobody shows up.
- Get in touch with the bitcoin startups (they will probably find you). They want bitcoin to succeed as much as you, so they should be willing to help.
- You will get two types of people: those who already know  a lot about bitcoin and those who want to learn. Try to cater to both audiences. We dedicate the first hour to beginners.
- Once you get 15+ people per week, start giving presentations. Before that you can keep it more casual if you like.
- Involve your members in the organisation. It will not grow if you assume all the responsibility. Make sure it's not just you who is presenting every week.
- A popular topic of discussion for us has been the weekly bitcoin news. You could summarize and present it each week.
- For our location we picked a cafe with an ATM where you can pay with bitcoin.
- You could browse through the descriptions of our previous meetups to get an idea of how our planning evolved.
Hope this helps! Good luck, and feel free to message me if you have any questions.

I pretty much agree, and I am equally skeptical whether coin voting will ever be good enough to serve as a real solution.


In the theoretical measurable 95% economic support scenario you'd have to wonder why a miner would ever refuse to flag for it. If it doesn't affect their payouts significantly, they are either being lazy or seeking power in the form of leverage, both behaviors that probably justify forking away from.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:04:37
You are right, those stats do not exist. This is a large problem because any minority can claim to be the majority. And to clarify, I said soft forks are less contentious than hard forks, which is not a statement about how many people are against BU but rather that more people are for segwit.
The reason I say this is because segwit gives BU proponents what they want (some scaling, though obviously not enough), but BU doesn't give segwit proponents what they want (limited scaling to preserve decentralization, limited risk of a network split).
Now obviously a bunch of people are claiming to be against segwit as political leverage to get more people on board with their vision, but that is just an act.
[This post]( may also clarify my thoughts further.

I appreciate the link, luke-jr. I think I have read arguments along those lines before, but I am not sure if I fully understand the problem.
If transaction X inside a block is unpublished, can't that in itself be the fraud proof? Someone informs me of missing data and I try to request the missing data from the network. My failure to do so informs me something is wrong.
The assumption that someone would have provided the data if it was out there doesn't seem too unreasonable. If I am only connected to malicious peers then my full node would have the same issue of not being able to retrieve the data (and additionally they could fool me into believing a certain chain is the longest while it is not).
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:40:48


Good question. Basically a contentious hard fork will cause damage to the bitcoin economy for various reasons:
- Two versions of bitcoin will lead to confusion and instability due to speculation
- Trust in the system is degraded, who knows when it might fork again
- People will leave the system, causing the value to decline
You gotta weigh the above against whatever hard fork change it is that you want. If you think the damage of not hard forking is higher than a contentious fork, then that is the right decision for you. For instance, if I was convinced there's a bug that would absolutely destroy the network within a year, I would hard fork (or sell my coins) regardless of how many people think otherwise.
But in general terms, the fact that there's a significant cost to doing a contentious hard fork is what makes it hard to make changes. I think everyone would like to see hard fork changes, but most people consider the risk to be not worth it.
You know, BU could hard fork tomorrow with their 20% or so hash rate and have their own happy little economy, but that is not what they want for the exact same reasons I pointed at above. Where it gets messy is that they want everyone to come along, and because their rational and technical arguments have been largely rejected, they have resorted to tactics that really shouldn't matter like fear (threatening a hard fork), greed (incentivizing miners), and misinformation ("Blockstream Core is the devil").
I truly am sympathetic to their wishes, but emotional manipulation will never unite the masses in the way that they desire. The only reason it works for real-world politics, is because leaving the country (or starting your own) is not a viable option. The debate was lost when their non-emotional arguments got rejected, their only option now is to fork as a minority, leave the system, or accept the status quo. All the other stuff is just causing damage with no gain.


You call that a technicality, but it really isn't. The paycheck of the miners comes out of our pocket. At work, is your boss only technically in charge, but really you are the one running the company? What's true though is that the boss here (the economic actors) has a very hard to measure opinion, while the employees (the miners) have a very clear voice.
It's also hard to fire a single miner, but it can theoretically be achieved by asking miners to orphan their blocks (the implicit threat being that they otherwise might all get fired). Of course this again relies on the economic actors successfully voicing their opinion, so in reality miners can probably get away with a certain amount of bad behavior.
I hope some day we will figure out a better way to measure economic opinion. It would empower those who matter the most.

Good point. BU seems to attract a lot of questionable people and I don't think that's a coincidence.

For instance, if someone wanted to divide a community, they would support the minority in any issue, regardless of which side it is.

What about all the coins that are lost and won't be migrated, though? The shock to the system is going to be enormous when those coins start moving.
@_date: 2017-02-17 09:14:34
I agree with most of what you say, but I suspect we might disagree on how much power miners have.




I think it would be more accurate to say that miners are the ones that move to a different fork, and users stay on the old one. The question is, on which fork is the value that miners get paid from?
The way I see it users collectively put a reward on the table (12.5 btc per block, which has a dollar value thanks to those same users) and miners can either grab that reward or not. If they don't, someone else will. Not following the rules set out by users would be equivalent to not mining.
Now imagine the same scenario, but now all users collectively say they are changing the rules X months from now. Miners have the same option: they either mine those economically valuable coins under the new rules, or they don't (by not going along with the change).
Of course there's a big problem: users don't have an easy-to-measure collective voice to make such a coordinated decision. They can't signal in the same way that PoW does, but just because their opinion is hard to measure, doesn't mean that they don't have the power to decide... the process is just uncoordinated and messy.
Part of that mess is what we are seeing here on forums. They are attempts to coordinate among users. And it's the reason why I like research on coin voting and proposals like yours about paying fees to specific miners. If users had a better way to coordinate, the road to progress would be a lot less bumpy.
At the end of the day, only the chain that users economically support will have value, it is just hard to measure in advance which chain that will be. The miners will always follow the money, that is why they are not in power.

If I download any data that connects to the merkle tree, I have falsified the claim that everything is unpublished, but I can see how I can continually receive those claims from different nodes and end up downloading a lot.


What's the harm in temporarily banning them (or only banning further claims of missing data)? A node that is only connected to malicious nodes is not something I'd want to be connected to, and now that I have the data I can even help out the node (assuming it was not malicious itself, but merely connected to malicious nodes) by sending some of the data it claimed was missing. Eventually we should all end up with a set of honest nodes, no?

Duhace, I don't agree that noriskwallet carries any risk (B won't sign Z until X is guaranteed), but you do make some valid observations about transaction N and M!
To me, this seems to be the core of the problem (I'll be referring to [this overview](
* A (the buyer) has to either have funds locked with B (the 3rd party) in advance, or you still end up waiting for transaction N to confirm.
* The same goes for B and C (the merchant) and transaction M, and you can't expect B to have funds locked with every merchant.
In other words, we either need an impossible amount of collateral with each merchant or we still need to wait for transaction N and M to confirm.
The instant confirmation scheme by [GreenAddress]( seems like a more viable solution. You do need to trust GreenAddress, but they instantly lose all credibility if a double spend ever occurs.
If you insist on not trusting a third party, then it would be much simpler to just lock the funds between yourself and the merchant, as I've proposed [here]( and Peter Todd summarized [here]( (I'm credited by him [here](

Yeah, I get that. Everyone has a point where they'd be willing to do a contentious fork or sell their coins.


I think that's an argument in favor of a conservative approach, though. Once the blockchain becomes huge, there's no way to go back, but if we move forward slowly, we can always go up more later when there's more data.


I can understand that too. This whole thing is quite tiring for everyone, but I think communication is the only way to get people to reach some kind of consensus. For what it's worth I spend a good amount of time reading BU arguments and trying to understand them.

You can have your own chain fork today if you like. So what are you waiting for? A majority of users to agree with you? Why? 
Just like everyone else you don't want a continuous hard fork. You want to be on the network that everyone else uses, because that's what gives it value.
If you are going to get that majority with rational arguments then I fully support your efforts. We could have a friendly debate and who knows maybe you can convince people like me. If you resort to manipulative measures, you are hurting others to further your own agenda. I hope you fall in the former category.

Unfortunately that signal comes after the decision has been made to attempt the fork. On top of that there is a lot of noise when it comes to price due to speculation. The price of bitcoin has gone up recently, is that a signal for miners to keep blocks at 1 MB?
If there was an infinite number of blockchains with an infinite number of different consensus rules, the free market might eventually figure out which one is best, but any single blockchain will have a poor chance of surviving.

That sounds useful. I've been trying to get my full node to run through Tor but I couldn't quite get it working. It's not exactly user friendly at the moment.


It won't cause disruption, but it increases the propagation time and therefore the chances of your block getting orphaned. The question then becomes whether the increase in fees outweighs the orphaning risk. But if it does, then miners have a further centralizing incentive to reduce the orphaning risk to zero. Ironically headers-first mining, while generally thought of as bad, kind of counteracts these issues. If miners don't wait for the full block, propagation times don't matter as much.


Hmm yeah, I believe if more than 51% of the miners have your transaction then the propagation time increase for the other side works out in your favor (but can be counteracted with headers-first mining). Interesting.

Vitalik talks about the morality of controversial soft forks, but he neglects to mention that there is no reason for any user to reject a soft fork if it restricts a transaction type that is not currently in use (otherwise it would be an evil soft fork). The old rules are not affected, so users don't lose anything.
The only objection I can think of is if it makes running full nodes under the new rules so expensive that it causes more miner centralization. A user can choose not to enforce the new rules, but miners can't if they want to receive the fees and remain competitive.

Could you elaborate what you thought was misleading? Everything that went on in the event was publicly shown, nothing was secret.
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:36:11
It's the other way around.
Stealth addresses require an OP_RETURN output for every transaction and require the recipient to continuously scan the blockchain or trust a third party to do it for them (i.e. doesn't scale).
Payment codes require only one OP_RETURN transaction per user (it seems the criticism in your link is outdated), and from that point any transaction made with a payment code will look like a regular payment, and the recipient knows exactly which address to expect a payment from.
This is a good explanation by jim618:
1. Alice sends Bob a notification bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN nonce
2. Both Alice and Bob use the nonce to work out an ECDH shared secret.
3. Alice and Bob can then create an HD account (that only they know about ) to use for their transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-04 04:22:07




From the perspective of unupgraded nodes, segwit transactions simply take up less space, which means even for regular transactions there is more space available (or rather, decreased demand for that space) and fees go down. Literally everybody wins.


Nobody wants to hurt the miners. The incentives of users are aligned with keeping the mining ecosystem healthy. Any change that would run them out of business would just increase centralization.


Ignoring for a second that it is very hard to get consensus on a User Activated Soft Fork, the idea actually aligns quite well with incentivizing miners to upgrade.
For every miner that goes along with the UASF, it means that other miners have an increased chance of getting their block orphaned if they don't also validate the new rules (i.e. if they mine on a block that didn't follow the new rules). That is the economic incentive.

It's fair to question whether recording equipment should have been allowed, or whether attendance should have been more open, but people voluntarily chose to attend the event. There was no injustice inflicted upon them, because *nobody forced them*.
What you did *was forceful*. You tried to deny them the rules they had voluntarily agreed to follow.
Yes, perhaps those rules are bad and should not be condoned (e.g. by boycotting the event), but that is for each individual person to decide. Argue with them, try to convince them, but don't deny people their freedom of choice. If they don't like it, they can act for themselves.

During a hard fork, any old nodes that are left on the network will form their own chain (minority fork). Any unsuspecting user who relies on an unupgraded full node could be fooled into thinking he received a payment, while in fact he did not (i.e. the money went elsewhere on the majority chain).
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:22:11
All good points. I also don't think a hard fork is such a huge risk, for the reasons you described.
I'll add one point to my own argument: miners on the majority chain can redirect their hashing power to attack the minority chain, so they are in a reasonable position to fake a payment during the fork.

Adam has a point. If Classic stands for a 2MB hard fork and Core stands for a ~2MB soft fork, then it makes sense to go with Core. That is the choice you are currently facing when choosing Classic or Core.
As a separate point of discussion, we could talk about whether 4MB is a better target (e.g. by combining SW with a 2MB HF), but it currently seems that 2MB has the most support.

I like this, but it really gets in the way of giving a quick demo to show people how easy it is to send/receive bitcoins. I think it should start gently recommending the creation of backup at something like $20-$99 and then be more forceful about it at $100+.
I wonder, how will the Mycelium redesign handle this, @_date: 2017-03-27 04:02:51
Agreed. I would add that the system needs to be designed around full blocks (since demand is infinite), and that means there is always a chance of the transaction fee being too low due to a sudden increase in demand. The problem is that you can't do anything about it at the moment when it happens. Wallets need to implement better fee prediction, and add replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent. That is the real solution, not a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:02:54


Good explanation. I suspect he was so afraid of LN that he didn't even dare to discuss it, in order to not expose his weakness. Ironically this also made it impossible for anyone to correct him on the fact that Lightning will not detract from miner income.
Another way to look at why Lightning is good for miners, is when you ask how much someone is willing to pay for a transaction on the blockchain. For one transaction of $100, maybe I would pay a couple of dollars at most. But if I lock that $100 in a Lightning channel, that money can be sent back and forth hundreds of times and cause thousands of dollars worth of transactions for the entire period my channel is open. I'd be willing to pay a much higher fee for that.

Good question. Despite the [excellent elaborate answer]( by I am still having trouble understanding the full ramifications of assumevalid.


Core doesn't even have to give the UTXO set. Assumevalid would imply that everything inside the blocks is valid, including the commitment to the UTXO set, which can then be downloaded from miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:22:08
Hmm, r/btc going the alt coin route seems like a positive development, but there are potential dangers to merged mining that need to be considered.
1.  Bitcoin is designed around game theory where miners are incentivized with coins. Adding a second blockchain means that the original blockchain is no longer fully in control of those incentives.
2. All miners will need to mine both chains in order to maximize their fee income and remain competitive. If this makes validation increasingly expensive for miners, it will cause mining pool centralization in order to minimize the costs (or if both chains wish to remain decentralized they'd be competing for the same limited resources).
It might be better if it had a different PoW algorithm.
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:02:01
Unfortunately it still requires cooperation in order to add or remove participants. Removing an uncooperative participant would be really nice to have.

@_date: 2018-10-15 01:07:19
That is correct. The federation can only steal coins if they manage to collude with a prior owner of that specific UTXO. The misbehavior will be obvious, so everyone else can redeem their coins on-chain if they ever see this happen.
It's only a slight security benefit over federated sidechains (which can be further enhanced with HSMs), but the main advantage is that the federation never has full control over the coins, so a lot of existing regulations don't apply to them.

Last I've heard was this statement from Adam Back four days ago:




In October 2014, we released the sidechains whitepaper. In June of 2015, we launched Elements, the first working implementation of sidechains. This inspired a number of other exciting sidechains projects, like Rootstock and Hivemind. In October 2015, we launched the Liquid protocol, which is our first production sidechain. This protocol makes bitcoin exchanges interoperable. Bitcoin exchanges are just the first test case for the technology and it can be applied across a number of financial assets.
While we’ve made a lot of progress, sidechains are currently federated rather than truly decentralized. There’s a lot of work to be done on this front still.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:27:40
I think saying it's a store of value is just a way to communicate that you think that the transaction fees are going to be on the relatively expensive side in the future.
Obviously the extreme interpretation of storing bitcoins forever and never spending them would be pointless, but perhaps you'd be sending high-fee transactions sporadically to move a number of your coins to a different layer (lightning, sidechains, or even centralized services) and perform your day-to-day transactions there.
It would certainly be nice if fees never get high like that, but I can see it happening if bitcoin becomes immensely popular one day, though I also imagine some people are more optimistic and think we can scale faster than fees will rise.
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:13:32


Uncertainty in itself is enough to cause a divide. No matter why certain people have different opinions, in bitcoin the conservative side is always more likely to get what they want. I do agree that exchanging factual information can potentially help bring those opinions closer together.


I do see your point, more users means a bigger pool of users that could potentially run a full node. 1% of a 1 million is a lot less than 1% of 1 billion. Allow me to provide a few counter points.
Bigger blocks does not guarantee an increase in users. Past performance is no guarantee for the future. It is dangerous to place the survival of bitcoin on this. Even with small blocks bitcoin serves a purpose. With centralization it serves none.
Even if the group of potential node operators grows, the percentage of people who are willing to run one will go down as operating costs increase. Here are some numbers. Today I can download Bitcoin Core and verify the 100 GB blockchain in 8-16 hours on an average computer. With 2 MB blocks the blockchain will double in size within a year, and so will verification time (though this is offset by 17% yearly growth of Moore's law).
It is not the number of nodes that matters, it's the ability of every individual user to independently verify the blockchain. If they can no longer run their own full node, the fundamental trust assumption of bitcoin changes from that of no trust, to trusting a third party.
@_date: 2017-01-29 04:02:34
You know, people say all kinds of things, like "if segwit was a hard fork it would be accepted" and "2 mb hf first, then segwit", but I highly doubt that appeasement would end of the debate. There will just be some new demand after that.
At the end of the day there's one group who thinks users should remain empowered by keeping the cost of running a full node low, and another group who thinks it's okay if only a select number of entities can run them. As long as this difference of opinion exists, there will be disagreement about scaling.
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:07:27


Replace the word hard fork by soft fork and you have exactly what some people are trying to do right now: contending a soft fork.
I am unsure if you agree with me on this, but I consider it a fact that a soft fork is easier to agree on than a hard fork, yet there is disagreement already.
It goes back to what I said earlier:


Perhaps people can agree to bump up the size a little bit as a hard fork at some point in the future, but the people who think operating costs of a full node don't matter will not be satisfied. Bigger blocks = lower fees = more users, so why stop at 2, 20, 200 MB?
If bitcoin works as intended (resisting the [tyranny of the majority]( these people will never get what they want. The network is resistant to change, and only the most conservative will happen (e.g. a 20 MB proponent wants 2 MB over 1 MB, but a 2 MB proponent will never agree to 20 MB).
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:48:40

@_date: 2017-01-30 03:15:13
I agree that keeping everybody happy is ideal, but so far nobody found a way to achieve this. I'm hopeful sidechains will enable this some day, but there is no good decentralized way of doing it yet.
I think a hard fork around contentious issues is unlikely because nobody wants a network split. Even some people who claim they want it just use it as leverage in order to be heard.

@_date: 2017-08-14 06:29:50
Wild speculation:
- It may not be easy for billions of people to communicate through satellites, but perhaps like radio this is a form of one-way communication, allowing everyone to 'tune in' to the blockchain.
- It would still need to receive the blockchain in the first place. PoW validity checks prevent spam, and the satellite could take donations and send out payments to those who send valid blocks to it with the most PoW.
- Space can be seen as a form of tamper resistance. Of course you'd have to trust that no backdoors are built-in, and you won't be able to audit it after launch.
- Other (non) blockchain applications can be built with time-locked encryption. The satellite releases private keys of a publicly available HD public key (sent after launch, entropy can be taken from the blockchain), allowing people to encrypt messages that cannot be decrypted until the satellite releases the private key at a set time in the future.

Statechain federation + transitory key (known by Bob), and Bob has a relative timelock transaction that ensures he can eventually get the money on his own.


I had a version of this before eltoo, but it wasn't great because it required long timelocks that tick down with each transfer (the same problem that is described in the Lightning channel factories paper).


There is a variation using blind signatures that I talk about during the final slide of my presentation (not in the paper). This makes it so the entity doesn't even know which UTXOs it has control over.

Is there anyone who can elaborate on the [introduction of assumed-valid blocks](
If the default behavior is to skip validation of signatures, wouldn't this lead to an incentive cliff? From what I understand it still needs to be the chain with the most proof of work, but it still seems like a trust assumption to me. And what is the default point at which blocks will be assumed-valid? 3 months before release? 1 year?
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:48:02
Looks like there's a new method to speed up IBD by skipping validation of old blocks.


And the PR itself contains the following explanation:
    Introduction of assumed-valid blocks
    
    - A significant portion of the initial block download time is spent verifying
     scripts/signatures. Although the verification must pass to ensure the security
     of the system, no other result from this verification is needed: If the node
     knew the history of a given block were valid it could skip checking scripts
     for its ancestors.
    
    - A new configuration option 'assumevalid' is provided to express this knowledge
     to the software. Unlike the 'checkpoints' in the past this setting does not
     force the use of a particular chain: chains that are consistent with it are
     processed quicker, but other chains are still accepted if they'd otherwise
     be chosen as best. Also unlike 'checkpoints' the user can configure which
     block history is assumed true, this means that even outdated software can
     sync more quickly if the setting is updated by the user.
    
    - Because the validity of a chain history is a simple objective fact it is much
     easier to review this setting. As a result the software ships with a default
     value adjusted to match the current chain shortly before release. The use
     of this default value can be disabled by setting -assumevalid=0
Doesn't this pose a risk where users with this option enabled (which is the default) end up on the wrong chain?
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:04:53
Thank you for the links and efforts.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:03:42


I agree, there is no way to be 100% objective about these things.


Again I agree, the network effect is important. I am hopeful that we will be able to achieve that without risking a divide in the community by hard forking without full consensus. Schnorr, MAST, tumblebit, lightning network, sidechains, extension blocks and perhaps even mimblewimble can get us a long way.


And this too I agree with. While I don't know if it will ever be possible, I really do hope we can some day get a hard fork that is not contentious. Bitcoin should ideally scale with technology, as this won't increase the cost of running a full node.
Thank you for continuing this debate in a civil manner. I enjoyed it :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:47:30
Nice post. I have had similar thoughts. Bitcoin isn't designed for a situation where other systems are competing for the same PoW. I also find it hard to wrap my head around how things will unfold.


It doesn't matter who initiated it. If it is a weakness in the system, someone would have exploited it sooner or later. Bitcoin needs to be able to survive any type of attack.

No further softforks are needed. Without a malleability fix LN still works, but it's less efficient because you can't keep a channel open indefinitely.

Okay, yeah I agree that IBD will get worse in the coming years, but it does slow down (and eventually will reverse), because in two years the growth rate will be 33% etc.
So from my calculations IBD at its highest point four years from now will be 137% slower than it is today (e.g. if IBD takes 8 hours today, it will take 19 hours approx).
In your mind, what IBD should we be aiming for? Is there a certain sweet spot (e.g. &lt;8 hours)?

@_date: 2017-08-10 04:25:02
I find your point of view interesting and have thought about it a lot myself. I agree that there's a lot to say for it, but for better or worse, it is not how bitcoin works today.


Your full node is fully secure according to the non-segwit rules and does not need to download more than 1 MB. Your full node does not care who spends OP_NOP transactions. By running segwit, I voluntarily chose to reject some of those transactions. A majority of miners chose to go along with it. From your full node's point of view, this is analogous to miners censoring certain valid transactions. Whether you like it or not, miners have this power. Your only defense is to fork away from these miners (one could argue that this is a flaw in bitcoin).


You control if the rules change or not, but you do not control others. If everyone else on the planet moves away from those rules, you will have nobody to transact with. I do think we will eventually reach a point where the cost of upgrading the network will not outweigh the benefits of a hard fork.


With pruning and discounted witness data, this ability is minimally impacted, but it does have an impact. You will have to ignore the witness data. People say not validating the witness data reduces your full node to SPV security. I think it's often a useful analogy, but not fully accurate. The bitcoin protocol does not give you the ability to guarantee in advance which blocks miners will reject. For all we know they might be censoring blocks with transactions made by Satoshi (we just haven't seen any yet).


I believe this fully holds for segwit. Old full nodes can still send and receive coins according to their rules. Soft forks are generally backwards compatible.
In short, I think miners would first need to lose the ability to censor transactions in order for bitcoin to function the way you desire. I know Adam Back in the past worked on ideas to allow miners to mine transactions blindly (the content gets revealed later). I wonder if such a feature would make soft forks impossible.

I think it would have to include fees. I am not too worried about pools deliberately not mining high fees, because that costs them money. The bigger problem is that they can include arbitrarily high fees by paying themselves.


If fees are minimal compared to the block reward, then indeed we wouldn't have to worry so much about manipulation. But I am of the opinion that fees will go up again eventually (e.g. LN itself will probably attract more users than we have today).


I don't completely follow, but I think there might be some confusion on how the hashrate is calculated. The Bitcoin blocks themselves contain all the evidence: the proof of work of the block header.


Thanks for thinking about this. As you have already noticed, there are lots of ways to go about calculating the PPB. I'd like for other people to look into it further. My thoughts are [here](

I am not sure where the confusion lies, but PoW is literally an indicator of global hashrate.


If there are 10 pools with 10&amp; of the hashrate each, then each pool is expected to find a block every 100 minutes on average, and the blockchain is expected to move forward every 10 minutes.  
If there are 5 pools with 10&amp; of the hashrate and one pool with 50&amp; then those 5 pools still find a block every 100 minutes, and that one pool will find one every 20 minutes. The blockchain still moves forward every 10 minutes.
How miners are pooling has no influence on the blockchain whatsoever. The global hashrate stays the same.

Bitcoin can lose both these advantages.

Assuming by security he simply means mining power, he strongly undervalues the immense coding efforts that enable decentralization.
Bitcoin only has value if it maintains a good balance between scaling and maintaining decentralization.

You are sharing the channel. On the Statechain you send the entire UTXO from Bob to Bob+Carol to Bob+Carol+Dave (and you build a Lightning channel on top). Thanks to MuSig these all look like single keys, indistinguishable from a single user.


No, the federation can only be removed from the UTXO by going on-chain.

Off the top of my head, fees are another bit of data that could be made accessible. If you go long, it would kind of be like pre-purchasing block space for future transactions (such as closing Lightning channels).

Statechains are a novel layer two protocol, designed for off-chain Bitcoin transfer. It is facilitated by a multisig federation which never has complete control, making it non-custodial. The federation can be completely blind, meaning it won't even know which transactions it's signing.
It integrates seamlessly with the Lightning Network, allowing the opening/rebalancing/closing of channels to occur off-chain via Statechains, making on-boarding onto Lightning instant, and allowing you to swap participants in and out of channel factories.
Privacy is also enhanced. UTXOs can be swapped atomically, allowing for the equivalent of off-chain coinjoin. Blind Signatures make the federation completely unaware of what they are signing. They can’t even see whether their activity has anything to do with Bitcoin!
This and many more features become possible off-chain – Discreet Log Contracts, cross-chain atomic swaps (DEX equivalent), transfer of non-fungible RGB tokens, etc! Curious to learn more? Then [read my Medium article](

This is purely hypothetical, but you can imagine user Bob starting off with a couple of bitcoins in Statechain UTXOs, e.g. 3x 1BTC. He has dinner with Carol. Carol pays the bill, and Bob pays back Carol in BTC. He does that by simply saying he wants to send 0.1BTC to Carol. The wallet then creates a 1BTC Lightning channel (Bob+Carol) on the Statechain, where Carol gets 0.1 and Bob gets 0.9.
Later Bob visits Dave's bar and buys a beer (0.1). Since Bob and Carol both know Dave, they decide to include him in the same channel (note: if you do this with an unreliable person and they disappear, then your channel will need to be closed on-chain). So now there's Bob(0.8)+Carol(0.1)+Dave(0.1).
Later on Carol also visits Dave's bar and buys a beer. This moves all the money in the channel from Carol to Dave, leaving just Bob(0.8)+Dave(0.2).
The unique things that happened here which are not possible off-chain in regular Lightning: instantly opening a channel, adding users to channels, removing users from channels.
From the perspective of a wallet, the user would need to communicate trust relationships (e.g. the wallet needs to know whether it's okay for Bob+Carol+Dave to share a channel), and smart automated decisions would need to be made in order to limit the number of shared channels (e.g. do we remove Carol from the Bob+Carol+Dave channel, or do we create a new channel between Carol and Dave? Or maybe we have a 0.1BTC UTXO lying around which we can transfer directly?).

This is the simplest example: If you want to make a bet, you'd want to lock up money with someone who takes the other side of the bet, and an arbitrator that decides the result of the bet if there is a disagreement. This is 2-of-3 multisig. With Statechains this can now occur off-chain.

Miners can't create false blocks, full nodes will reject them. Miners could censor transactions, but this comes at the cost of losing out on fees, which means they won't be competitive against non-censoring miners.
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:36:16
TLDR: Miners buy bitcoins by creating blocks, and they pay for it in electricity. Interestingly, this data gets recorded on the blockchain as PoW. By allowing people to trade on this info, we have essentially created a new PoW-based asset.
Some open questions:
* How prone to miner manipulation is this?
* Does it impact Bitcoin's incentive structure negatively somehow?
* Can it be used for things other than trading?
Here are some of my other ideas:
* Theoretically, after we hit the thermodynamic limit, we could use the PPB to adjust the block reward and disconnect the security of the system from price fluctuations (e.g. if the Bitcoin price drops by half, miners get twice as many bitcoins per block). However, this is even more likely to get manipulated by miners to the point where it's probably a bad idea.
* By comparing the PPB and dollar price data of both BCH and BTC, we can see whether the hashrate per dollar was higher on BCH, which would be an indicator that covert asicboost was actively used on that chain. This would be quite a bit of work, but I believe it is possible.
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:56:12


My guess is that competition compels them to do both.


Hard to say. Whatever is most efficient will come out on top. Check out these articles:


The assumption is that miners follow the market. For every block they receive some bitcoins, and as long as there are people out there who are willing to pay more for them than the cost of mining, miners will continue to mine (presumably forever, since blocks become easier to mine when there is less demand).
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:56:35
I'm not sure if this answers your question, but you can atomicly update both a Statechain and a Lightning channel, enabling trust-minimized payment for service.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:22:29
Yup, glad you like it :)
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:38:36


Yeah, I see a lot of benefits and few downsides (but perhaps we haven't looked hard enough yet).


It's slightly more complicated than that. Every time the key gets transferred, you also need to sign an eltoo transaction which allows for the redemption of the money without the hardware. And that transaction also has a state number that needs to be updated and transferred along with the key (this ensures the last owner has the highest state number, and therefore gets the money if there's an on-chain dispute).


I think they're a natural fit, so definitely, let's talk :)
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:29:52


In practice that seems to come down to having to trust 33% of the federation in order to accept its services, regardless of whether you yourself are in the federation.


That was the part I meant would become difficult. Our set of tradeable coins is limited to the set of federations we both trust, which makes me think it's likely that everyone will just gravitate towards a single highly reliable federation.


It is a point of failure, and I do think the market should be free to create any set of federations it likes, so generally speaking I support the possibility of your vision.
I guess you could have a list of trusted federation members Any chain for which 33% of the federation isn't on your list gets rejected. If you are picky, it means your set of acceptable coins shrinks.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:49:29
Yup, Schnorr and eltoo (SIGHASH\_ANYPREVOUT)!
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:30:51
You make a valid observation about Sidechains vs Lightning. Allow me to add a few more:
\- Lightning is limited in throughput. You cannot send more than the channels allows, and the more you send, the higher the fees.
\- Sidechains do achieve some limited amount of scaling, depending on economic activity. E.g. if Bitcoin is the "world" chain, and there is a "Europe" and "Asia" sidechain, then you'd only have to verify Bitcoin + "Europe" or Bitcoin + "Asia" 
\- Statechains scale differently from Sidechains, because every coin is a chain.
Staechains seem different enough to be potentially useful in some situations, which imo is good enough.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:00:16
Transferring private keys via trusted hardware and remote attestation is an old but interesting idea (e.g. [Teechan]( and [before]( Combining it with [Statechains]( has some significant security benefits (as I mention [here](
\- If the private key somehow leaks from the device, the coins are still secured by the federation
\- Conversely, the federation cannot cheat as long as the hardware remains secure
\- The off-chain eltoo transaction guarantees the money can still be redeemed when the device breaks
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:44:21
Correct, with the added caveat that the "who" is just a pseudonymous key (particularly if you connect via Tor).
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:18:24
A better way of putting it would be: Entity + 1 of N, where N can grow to any number of users.
The Statechain entity cannot hold the funds hostage, because it signs a transaction that allows the final user to withdraw their money on-chain at any time. This is kind of similar to how Lightning channels work.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:24:59


That is correct!
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:34:00
Hmm yeah, with TEE and attestation you could exchange private keys with certain amounts loaded on them and use them as coins...
But it seems this would be impossible to backup?
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:20:14
So assuming eventually we'll eventually have a TB bidirectional payment hub, is the idea that everyone pays each other through it? The hub would need a huge amount of bitcoins, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:44:30
It seems like it could scale better than sidechains, because every coin is its own chain, so you only track the full history of coins you receive. You do need a list of all chains in order to ensure your chain is only listed once. Note that the history can also be reset with a single on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:51:30
Yes, that's possible. It's functionally the same as having a single federation (i.e. two groups of people combined is also a group of people).
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:21:57
I think that's a perfectly reasonable tradeoff, but I'd recommend reserving the word "trustless" for situations where you don't rely on trusting others.
Edit: some reasonable counter-points were made: the watchtower doesn't control the money, and they're incentivized not to cheat.
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:13:15
Thanks for your interest.
1. Instant.
2. Not that I know, but I'd like for that to happen. Keep in mind that this requires SIGHASH\_ANYPREVOUT (previously known as SIGHASH\_NOINPUT), which may take a while before it gets soft forked into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:43:48
It's hard to tell how fine the denominations will be in practice, but yes, you'd have to download the history of each coin you want to receive. While this is less data than downloading the history of all coins, it's not something you'd be able to do ahead of time (like in IBD). I imagine a UTXO with a long history could grow to a couple of MB.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:56:44
If your transitory key also gets acquired by the hacker before the hack is discovered, then yes. There are ways to secure the transitory key with HSMs, but the primary form of security is that the federation does not fail. Worse than Lightning, much better than Coinbase, and slightly better than federated sidechains. Those who are not comfortable with the tradeoffs, should not use it.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:14:35


In some senses, yes. Note that I was saying that in reply to this:


This is no longer true for eltoo. You only need to keep the last state.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:20:11


Yes, that was my point, you can do the swap regardless of whether a Lightning channel currently exists. This gives a lot of flexibility.




Yes, I try to be very explicit about that. I don't consider the previous owners a reliable part of the security, unless you transfer the transitory key via an HSM.
It's worth noting that the federated sidechain model allows 33% of the participants to freeze the funds and force their will. This is not the case for Statechains -- you explicitly need 66% to do damage.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:40:10

@_date: 2019-06-06 05:30:40
It's hard to make it fair. Those with the fastest connection get the best deals.
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:32:16
Excellent summary. One thing which is not technically missing but I would highlight is that the ownership of the UTXO can change in its entirety. This means it can also be used as transfer mechanism to send an entire UTXO from one person to another (or groups of people). Together with atomic swaps this allows for some interesting functionality.
For instance, you can simultaneously have a Lightning channel open and engage in CoinSwaps with others, meaning you're mixing your UTXOs with others while your Lightning channel remains unaffected.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:27:29
Statechains do not affect Bitcoin's quantum security. My stance is that we should not worry about quantum, because it's still very theoretical and mitigating the threat is very costly (think 20x larger transactions), so it's not a good tradeoff.

The federation is a trusted third party (or rather a group of people in diverse locations). Your coins are only as safe as the federation is reliable.
You can also create a federation of your own, but it's unlikely people will trust you.
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:24:59
I agree, and this is why worst case the security is equivalent to federated sidechains. A truly malicious federation can absolutely do damage, but it does protect against other scenario's where federated sidechains offer less protection:
\- The federation losing its keys or going offline
\- The federation being forced by law to limit/confiscate your coins
Look at Liquid, for instance. The only way you can get your coins out is by going through an exchange (or finding someone willing to trade LBTC for BTC). This is a serious weak point, even if the federation intends to fully cooperate with its users.

I'm talking about how pre-fork bcash could theoretically be kept alive at minmum cost, similar to ETC.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:22:24
I purposely kept this a bit vague, but you probably want to calculate some kind of moving average. E.g. Every hour you look at the last 24 hours (note that this won't necessarily be 6 x 24 = 144 blocks), and you divide the total number of hashes that was performed by the total amount of bitcoins that miners received.
The larger the time frame, the less it gets affected by random fluctuations (or short-term manipulation).
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:15:37
I wonder how this would affect IBD. If you only check the range proofs of UTXOs then you'd still be guaranteed that no inflation occurred, but is that good enough? And can it be combined with assumevalid?
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:00:34
Interesting Lightning comparison. Note that with eltoo there will no longer be a need for revocation on Lightning. 


You do need to audit the Statechain activity (see [here]( because otherwise they can misbehave without anyone noticing. At the end of the day you are still trusting the federation, because we have to assume the worst case where they unblind your transactions and intercept the transitory key.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:28:03
How the original bcash could be kept alive:
- In practice, the EDA causes the difficulty to drop by 20% with each block, as long as there is a 2-hour gap between timestamps
- This means that pre-fork bcash can be kept alive indefinitely at that pace with just 5 blocks worth of hash power (1 + 0.8 + 0.64 + 0.512 + .... = 5)
- Depending on the timestamp of this fork block (t + 12 hours), the number might now be reduced to 4
- And since BCH difficulty at fork time was 40% that of BTC, it's equivalent to 1.6 BTC blocks

Perhaps I'm not following the argument, but it seems he's arguing you need to be part of the federation, rather than making an argument against large federations. That argument very clearly holds for N-of-N, but becomes weaker in M-of-N.
But I do agree that 3-of-5 where you trust 3 participants is better than 30-of-50 where you trust 3 participants, so I guess an argument for custom federations can be made, but I do suspect the coordination problem of having to trust the same federations in order to trade with someone makes it complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:16:12
Thanks for the detailed explanation, Andrew. It's hard to fully grasp the implications, but I am starting to see the bigger picture.


Does this require interaction with the oracle, or can the oracle just sign any data and we can build a SNARK around it that will ensure the proper outcome of a bet? The ideal end result would be roughly equivalent to a 2 out of 3 multisig that leaves no trace on the blockchain, and the oracle is unaware of its participation.

It's all a set of trade-offs, which will translate into some kind of cost/benefit that may or may not be appealing. We won't really know unless we try. I think you probably can't get around some kind of online device. Even for on-chain Bitcoin you should be running a full node.
And note that in eltoo the person who is closing the channel has to add their own UTXO to pay the fee, so it's not free. The actual owner can mitigate an old channel close 'attack' by paying an equivalent fee.

Perhaps one day, but that is not what demonstrated in this video. Currently it only achieves hash preimages, but the scaling and privacy implications are quite exciting. To me it shows that scriptless scripts are an area of research with a lot of potential.

As long as you mine a block every 2 hours, the difficulty keeps dropping. You can literally mine an infinite amount of blocks with the same effort it takes to create five (and now four) blocks, kind of [like this](
The difficulty does go up again every 2016 blocks, but its capped at 4x and the EDA itself is uncapped, so it won't actually affect you much.

@_date: 2019-06-04 19:09:59


That sure would be nice. If it wasn't, then sending on-chain transactions also wouldn't be expensive :)


In practice, it will have to be used together with Lightning. The two complement each other quite well. Lightning is restricted in terms of throughput, while Statechains are restricted in terms of fractional payments. Also, the way it is currently designed, the recipient needs to be online to receive a Statechains payment, just like in Lightning.
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:03:42


The script is exactly the same as a regular factory. All you need to do is add the federation key into the on-chain N-of-N multisig and leave the federation key out of the N-of-N in the settlement branch (since the federation won't be settling any money). See [these slides](


It means we can change ownership of multiple UTXOs atomically. The simplest atomic swap would be Bob giving his 1BTC UTXO to Carol, while Carol gives hers to Bob. We can do this with more than two UTXOs, allowing for something equivalent to coinjoin, hence the word "multi".


You don't need it, and I have not included it in my figures, but it may be worth adding back in for better privacy.


The number of transactions can be the same as regular factories. You can optionally add one more transaction if you wish to update the factory without involving the statechain, but you don't have to.


On the Statechain you will see a chain of Bob -&gt; Carol -&gt; Dave, each accompanied by a blind signature. The last person in the chain gets to request the next blind signature, giving them the power to move the funds, because the blind signature is an eltoo tx that reassigns who gets to withdraw on-chain.


Aside from updating the Statechain, only the update tx needs to change, to ensure the new owner(s) have an eltoo state that has priority over the prior owner(s).
Hope this helps.

**I'm the author. Feel free to ask questions, I'll do my best to answer everything. Here's a summary (**[**copied from Twitter**](
Blind Merged Mining (BMM) is the idea of committing the hash of another blockchain into a unique location of a block by paying miners. This increases the BTC hashrate without increasing the validation burden. The idea was first conceived of by Paul Sztorc.
I published a scheme that enables BMM, provided eltoo (or op\_ctv by Jeremy Rubin) gets soft forked in. It's a string of covenant transactions (h/t Anthony Towns) that anyone can freely compete over by paying a higher fee to miners via RBF, serving as the anchor for the unique hash. 
Even if BTC isn't aware of the BMM chain, the BMM chain will be aware of BTC, allowing for native atomic swaps and more. Use cases are numerous. More efficient colored coins, blockchains with experimental features (e.g. privacy), testnets, hashrate based contracts, etc. 
A native token is needed to pay for fees. I believe the most fair and non-speculative method is a perpetual one-way peg. At any time, 1 BTC can be burned for 1 token. This makes it unattractive for speculation and makes all BTC holders the beneficiaries of potential success.

The cost is 1.6 BTC blocks, which is roughly 25 BTC. In return you get an infinite amount of BCH blocks, but let's say you mine 2000 blocks, you'd get 25,000 BCH. If pre-fork BCH manages to be worth 0.001 BTC, you'll break even.
Note that you are not competing with the hard forked chain. It's a separate chain, like ETC.

The entity knows when it's talking to a previous owner, so this is not an issue. Think of it as two chains running in parallel.

Thanks for your thoughts, almkgor. I'm happy to see people like you are thinking about it deeply.


It would be harder to do swaps across federations, because everyone needs to agree on who to trust. It also seems strictly superior to have one big federation as opposed to many smaller ones.


[As I mentioned, that is not entirely accurate]( And more generally, I would not use Statechains if you do not trust the federation that runs it.


You can, by swapping Statechain UTXOs, and this is quite crucial. E.g. if you have a 2BTC UTXO with a BC channel where B has 0.5 and C has 1.5, you can swap the 2BTC UTXO for two 1BTC UTXOs, one of which owned by BC (B 0.5, C 0.5) and the other by Carol.

By non-critical I mean transactions that can be made through other means, such as Lightning or via sidechains. They are non-critical in the sense that suitable alternatives exist that give the same result for a cheaper price.

Since computers get better and better, and demand for block space is practically infinite, I do think there comes a time when a block size increase comes into consideration. And don't forget that even when you use Lightning you're still required to go on-chain from time to time. Lightning doesn't "solve" scaling, it merely makes more efficient use of the current block space.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:35:29
Hard forks aren't easy to get consensus on, so a one-time change that allows block size to grow linearly may be nice.

I don't think that is true. Extension blocks will have fees. Miners who do not take those fees will not be competitive and eventually get pushed out of the market.
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:12:43
It's the same trick as Taproot. It's a way to commit data into a public key.
You can commit data into public key A it by turning it into A' = A + hash(A,data)\*G.
It's called pay-to-contract because it was originally intended as a way to pay someone and simultaneously have them be provably aware of some data, such as the contract which they're expected to carry out in return for the payment.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:15:49
Mainly because people are taken by surprise when fees go up, and have no good way of dealing with it. If blocks are empty, it's easy: you just send the transaction and don't think about it. When blocks are full, you have to be smart about picking your fees, and maybe even reconsider whether you want to be sending as many on-chain transactions as you did.

Lightning is trustless, as long as you are paying attention to the network and send your proof in time if there's a dispute.
Federated sidechains have multisig security, meaning you trust that a majority of them don't act against you.
Statechains are like federated sidechains, but also require someone who previously held the money to act against you as well. On top of that you can exit the system without the explicit consent of the federation.


It actually sits between the base layer and Lightning. Statechains don't have the limitations that Lightning has (being limited the the coins that are in a channel/route), but this benefit comes at the expensive of less security (but still more than federated sidechains).


I will give you a very general answer: anything that does not require the input of a human can be automated. This means that generally speaking any interface can be made simple. In practice this will take years, but I have no doubt it will become more easy (just take the internet as an example).

The problem with that is that there are ways to hide the data in ways that are non-distinguishable from a normal transaction. These methods would not incur the higher fee and cause even more load on the network than OP\_RETURN. Therefore it's unavoidable, really.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:04:55
Glad you liked statechains, I really should be doing a better job of getting the word out. It's got a novel set of trade-offs and the private variant with blind signatures is particularly cool.
I think people are very focused on Bitcoin in its "pure" form, but it makes a lot of sense for people who don't need the full feature set (such as censorship resistance) to be okay with holding a Bitcoin IOU via a sidechain. I don't have an opinion on how common that use case should be, only that people should be able to use Bitcoin in a wide variety of ways and choose the way that suits them.

The 'check' (bitcoin transaction) won't be 'valid' (spendable) unless it contains the key that 'unlocks' (decrypts) the data (which was sent to you beforehand).
At that point you have already verified in Zero Knowledge that the data is correct, that the encrypted data that you received is in fact the correct data, and that you have a hash that corresponds to the key that decrypts the data. The transaction will only be valid if the hash and the key correspond.
I am still in the process of learning, so perhaps I got something wrong, but this is the way I currently understand it. Perhaps can verify if I got it right.

BMM is part of the puzzle of Sztorc's original Drivechains idea, but not the whole thing (most notably missing the two-way peg). I just figured out a way to implement it without requiring a soft fork specific to the feature (but still requiring sighash\_enyprevout or op\_ctv).
The perpetual one-way peg does seem to have a chance of delivering part of the promise of sidechains [while avoiding pump and dumps]( which is interesting. I'm hoping more discussion on this will follow.

BIP148 causes blocks that don't signal segwit to be rejected, which is quite forceful to miners who might not be ready or willing for whatever reason. Shaolinfry later made a more mild proposal (edit: now known as BIP8), which seems more reasonable to me:
Basically the proposal allows users to start enforcing segwit after the miner signalling period ends. If there is strong user support for this, it means that at that point miners won't be able to produce blocks that go against the new segwit rules (e.g. stealing segwit transactions). If they try to do it, their block will be seen as invalid to the users and the block reward will be worthless.
This proposal has less drawbacks. Miners can still produce old blocks if they want, and they aren't forced to signal anything.
Note that there is still a problem if a majority of miners don't enforce segwit and there's uncertainty whether everyone upgraded their nodes to support the UASF. A segwit-invalid transaction could make its way into the majority chain, causing a chain split. Anyone still running old nodes would follow it, since in their eyes it's the longest valid chain, whereas UASF nodes would reject it.
Edit: The new proposal is now known as BIP8. I edited the link accordingly.

I have been paying close attention to it. Some good people still work at Mycelium, but it is a sinking ship.
There have been three ICOs in a short time span that had the involvement of the Mycelium CEO with a bunch of questionable decisions.
- The Mycelium Token [overpromised]( and completely underdelivered.
- The MASS network has [scam written all over it]( Investors were voicing concerns in their Telegram chat and they just closed it. I messaged their PR person several times, no reply.
- They launched [Swish Coin]( which is the merchant payment platform of Mycelium. You'd think would fall under the Mycelium Token, but it doesn't. The Mycelium team didn't even know about the ICO launch when it happened. A complete mess.
- They recently added a "buy with credit card" feature that charges nearly 20%. Again, the profits do not go to Mycelium Token holders, since it conveniently got put under a different branch.
~~They also seem to be in favor of BU, which I personally think is a bad sign, but others may view differently.~~
On the bright side, they did add support for CPFP and improved fee estimation. Mycelium is not a bad wallet yet, but the writing is on the wall...

(Edit: [simplified explanation here](
**ELI20** 
Schnorr enables multisig compressed into a single pubkey. With graftroot, the multisig participants can together sign the scripts they might like to use in their stead, **which essentially creates a more space-efficient MAST** (no tree needed, so blockchain usage does not grow with the number of scripts).
- pubkey X is created by combining A and B, meaning the coins can be spent if both A and B agree
- alternatively, a script can be signed with X that allows A to spend the coins without B after a week (CSV)
- if A wants to spend the coins without B, she fulfills the requirements of the script (waiting a week) and reveals it to the blockchain
The overhead is 32 bytes (same as taproot), since half the signature (normally 64 bytes) can be non-interactively combined with other signatures in the transaction (in this case the signature of A).
The downside is that the signed script needs to be safely stored by A in order to redeem the transaction without B. Users also need to be extra careful with key reuse, since the script applies to ALL outputs with key X.

Well, you're looking at it from a different perspective. It's not just about scaling at all costs. You could have that today by switching to an altcoin. Clearly there is more to it: we want everyone to stick together.
People who are willing to wait for LN simply believe that's the only viable way to achieve this, and expect hard forks to only divide the community. The timeline is _irrelevant_.
It may even feel unfair, why should the LN people get their way and not the hard fork people? Because LN doesn't affect the status quo. People who dislike it can simply ignore it, but a successful hard fork requires the consent of _everyone_.

Even if mining was fully decentralized, I'm still not convinced it's good enough. There always remains an incentive cliff: if miners misbehave long enough, then they can steal all the coins in the sidechain, and Bitcoin users who are not observing/using the sidechain won't care.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:28:33


It is not the same assumption. Miners cannot create invalid blocks on the main chain, but they can on a sidechain. They can assign all the coins to themselves and then create the number of blocks that is required to prove it to the main chain (relatively cheap, since the cost of a sidechain block is nothing but fees).


No, drivechains is a proposal to make sure the attack I described above happens slow enough for users to ask the main chain miners to take action. Still, it is undoubtedly less secure than having coins on the main chain.

If A+B sign a script that allows C to spend the coins, and C loses that script, then C can ask A+B to reissue it, but they can refuse. Losing it really should be prevented, just like you shouldn't lose your private key.
Taproot does not have this downside, and you can in fact use both methods at the same time, but spending the coins through taproot results in a bigger transaction, and taproot requires you to commit to the scripts ahead of time.

@_date: 2018-02-20 13:36:57


The problem is that main chain nodes will accept the theft because they don't check the rules of the sidechain. Only sidechain nodes do that.
And you can't force users to run both nodes, because then it would essentially be a soft fork instead of a sidechain.


Yes. Every chain operates independently. That is the goal.
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:24:11
The idea is that the coins on both chains will be equivalent to one bitcoin (= pegged), because you can move back and forth between the chains.
- Lock up 1 BTC
- Show proof to sidechain and create/receive 1 sidechain BTC
- Destroy 1 sidechain BTC
- Show proof to the bitcoin blockchain and unlock 1 BTC
It's a very useful idea, but unfortunately nobody has found a way to do this without compromising decentralization. The sidechain will either be controlled by miners (SPV), or by a pre-designated group of people (federated).
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:05:35
Thanks for the clarification. Let me see if I understand it right:
- Unbatched bulletproofs: 4ms
- Unbatched ECDSA: 800us
- Batched bulletproofs: 400us
- Batched ECDSA: 80us
So batched bulletproofs are roughly 2x faster than unbatched ECDSA, but 5x slower than batched ECDSA.
Edit: these numbers are off, see [here](
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:39

If people send more than that, the price will keep going up, because the global price doubles with each messages and halves every 10 minutes.

I've been thinking about that a lot, since you posted about graftroot. It has a lot of similarities to Mimblewimble, except instead of signing an empty string to prove transaction validity, you sign a script. You can restrict what makes the signed script valid, but you can't prevent the owners from bypassing the script.
[I wrote about it]( in relation to Mimblewimble:










The above sentence in bold would be a situation where the taproot assumption is insufficient (and I guess covenants too, but I find those hard to reason about). For taproot (not graftroot) you could work around it by picking a provable burn address for C in P = C + H(C||S)G, so the only way to spend it is by revealing S, though that solution seems a bit messy.
It also makes me wonder in general whether there is a place for a Mimblewimble with full graftroot-like scripting, but you'd be giving up on introspective scripts that require data from the input to determine validity (like CSV).

Alyse makes an excellent point that overwhelming amounts of "fake news" make it hard for users to form their own opinion, causing them to rely on "experts". In a decentralized system where the users are in charge, this becomes a serious attack vector.

thank you for the insightful presentation!
Unfortunately, the video skips briefly a couple of times towards the end, and particularly around 38:42 (scriptless scripts) I was unable to fully follow what you were saying.
Could you maybe expand a little on that part? How exactly do bulletproofs enable scriptless smart contracts? 
Would there be a hash on the blockchain, and a bulletproof proves that the script inside the hash was executed, without revealing the script?

Afaik segwit2x does not preserve asicboost. The only way to still use asicboost after segwit is by ignoring segwit transactions, but that means you are leaving potential profit on the table.

I understand that it's hard not to get emotional, but I also know you are a proponent of rational thought. I think that is commendable and that's why I have taken the time to reply to you at length. I hope it gives you some more insight on why people disagree with you.


Rational miners mine what is most profitable, and users set the price. No amount of signalling will change that. If you agree to that, then you cannot interpret their signalling as representative of the expected outcome.


Companies do not speak for users. None of the services you use speak for you. Does your bank speak for you because you have a bank account? Do you agree to inflation because you use fiat? 


Regarding the article, I understand the line of thinking. I strongly disagree that appeasement can allow us to move forward if the goals are so fundamentally different. The argument boils down to: "Let's just do a 2 MB HF, it's a small price to pay to move forward". But it's not a small price, because it's not about 2 MB and the debate won't end there. You have to ask why people insist on 2 MB. It's about moving faster, accepting that things could break, and risking centralization. If you want people to accept a 2 MB hard fork, you will have to get them on board with the general motivation behind it.


Probably without fully understanding it, these people were sold on the idea of bitcoin the decentralized currency. Misplaced or not, they trust these companies to deliver this for them. We serve them best by trying to ensure that idea becomes a reality.


I personally think [rough consensus]( is the best option we have. You evaluate proposals by addressing all technical objections. Only if all objections can be addressed, you move forward with the proposal. Compromise has no place in this process (I recommend you read the full article to find out why). The beauty is that anyone, given enough techncial knowledge, can verify whether this process was followed. The outcome is likely to satisfy the largest number of people. In my evaluation segwit passes this process, and 2x does not.


I think I addressed these points. Hashpower has no say in this, uninformed users blindly trust wallet providers, though this trust may be misplaced. Companies can try to speak for these users by forking them, but what do you think will happen when you split the uninformed users from the informed ones?


No, I have independently reached the conclusion that it is the best way forward by evaluating the proposals as rationally as I can. As have a lot of others in here. It requires a lot of effort that most people don't have time for. Your only alternative is to trust the opinion of others, and that is why places like this start to look like echo-chambers. If you are going to trust someone, your best bet is to trust those who put the most time and effort into the tech: the Core developers.
Erik, I hope you still have the energy to reconsider your position. Thanks for reading, in any case.

I agree that mining is more centralized than we’d like, but I do not believe that changing the PoW will help.

Hybrid PoS/PoW is harder to argue about, but I don't think it can prevent miners from censoring transactions without also introducing the problems from non-hybrid PoS.

The impact is not easily measurable, but I agree that it matters a lot. One thing I've learned over the years of organizing meetups is that you need to be willing to sit down with people and really teach them how bitcoin works so they can independently understand why it's reliable, instead of just taking your word for it. This is the only way you can help people distinguish bitcoin from altcoins with bold claims.
Not many people take me up on that offer (understandably, bitcoin is complex), but the few that do will gain an unwavering trust in bitcoin (a level many of us in r/bitcoin have independently reached). It is those people who carry bitcoin forward.
And even those who do not take the time to learn will see the genuine passion and commitment. They see your willingness to teach them if only they took the time to learn, and they will be influenced by that commitment and enthusiasm.
This is how you spread a movement.

You're right, my simple ELI5 explanation might have made it sound like this wasn't possible today, while it is. basically already pointed it out, but it's mainly an efficiency improvement. Slightly oversimplified, you could say today's method would require two transactions, as opposed to one transaction through taproot/graftroot/MAST.

What do you think about sidechains that do not need to be validated by all miners? If you only have to validate the main chain and the sidechain(s) that you care about, haven't you achieved some efficiency by ignoring the sidechains that are irrelevant to you?

Too bad [they don't agree with each other](
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:09:35
- Alice and Bob have money on the Graftroot Bank, which they can spend with their signature
- This particular bank also enables them to sign a document that allows someone to spend money on their behalf
- Alice and Bob worry that in the event of their death, their daughter Carol is left with nothing
- They decide to give Carol a signed document that states that she can spend the money if their bank account remains unused for a year
- It is private and convenient for Alice and Bob, since they don't have to inform the bank whenever they sign a document like this
- The bank likes it too, because it requires no extra work unless one of these documents is actually used
The bank is the blockchain. Graftroot allows you to add more ways (=signing scripts) to spend your coins at any time (both before or after receiving the coins) without communicating this to the blockchain. Only when spending, the chosen script is revealed and verified on the blockchain with the signature.
**Practical Benefits**
- **Flexible**: You can create any number of scripts off-chain to spend your coins with.
- **Private**: When no scripts are used (the owners just sign), it looks just like any other ordinary transaction!
- **Efficient**: When used, you only reveal the chosen script, together with the signature. This means transactions are smaller, because we no longer put every possible script on the blockchain.

Some clarification for those who are confused – "more than 1600 members" refers to the size of our meetup, not the number of people who signed off on the open letter. The letter merely represents the values our community fosters, as [can be seen]( in half the topics of our monthly meetups over the past year:
- The Limitations of Bitcoin (&amp; Segwit Activation)
- Bitcoin Forks Explored
- The Tech in Blocks, Consensus &amp; Segwit (beginner friendly)
- Is Bitcoin Going To Hard Fork?
- The Risks of Upgrading (Hard/Soft Forks)
- Decentralized Scaling
For what it's worth, we are very open to opposing views, as I hope experienced himself the last time he attended our meetup. The advice I gave Roger back then still stands today: focus on building things, not taking things away from others. Everyone should get what they want, and we are happy to see coins like BCH or LTC that enable this. B2X, with the stated goal of replacing the original bitcoin chain, attempts to take things away.
Change should not happen at the cost of denying people the status quo. This does mean that change can be frustratingly slow and difficult, but I believe this to be the only consistent view. If you accept that it is okay to take things away from others, how can you expect others not to take things away from you? And how can you trust bitcoin not to change out from under you?

No, it's a different problem. 51% can censor/reverse transactions, but they can never break the rules of the network. With SPV (= blindly following the most PoW) the miners can break the rules.

I don't think this is a valid point. If you trust the other party not to double spend, then a transaction can be considered 'final' as soon as it is signed. Sending the private key is pointless and needlessly complex.

I've seen that. It is largely overhyped. The claim is that they have made compact PoW more secure, and while that's nice (if true), it doesn't solve the fundamental problem that miners control the sidechain.

Backing up the claims of what Ethereum calls a "full node" is not the same as in Bitcoin:
- Bitcoin -- download and verify the entire history from genesis
- Ethereum -- fetch the latest state from miners, only verify PoW
Ethereum essentially has SPV security for historic data. By the Bitcoin definition of a full node, [Ethereum can no longer be synced in a reasonable span of time on modern hardware](

Instead of saving the private key in the URL, perhaps it should store a signed transaction back to the pledger. You could even utilize nlocktime to automate the process (or simply as a backup in case the user loses the private key), but then a specific time limit needs to be chosen. The project would need an end date, or the user specifies a certain time frame. And then there's also the matter of supplying a return address (BIP70?).

It's very important for communities to remain independent. Don't take favors or money with strings attached, and never start to rely on it, because then strings can be attached later.

The number satoshi chose is 10 minutes per block, halving every 4 years, going down to 50 + 25 + 12.5 + etc = 100.

Except if the transaction is in a new block. Then the miner needs to validate it ASAP so it can start mining on top of it to avoid orphans (or validationless mining).


And how will this fee be paid? With the UTXO that the miner still has to check for validity? This does not prevent DoS attacks.

Edit: I wrote this without realizing someone already made a translation. You can find it [here]( It's more accurate than mine, so I recommend reading that one instead.
This interview was interpreted from Chinese into Korean. It would be better if someone translated the Chinese, and my Korean is far from perfect, but I'll paraphrase what I understood:
- Bitcoin might split into two coins, similarly to ETC/ETH. Miners will ultimately decide the hard fork, and over 90% is signalling segwit2x. It is also backed by over 70% of the users, so we assume they will follow.
- Bitmain plans to support Segwit2x through btc1
- The good thing about hard forks is that the transaction fees will go down and more people will use bitcoin. The hard part is that all the companies need to follow and update their software.
- People who love bitcoin support the hard fork, in China there are companies that like alt coins too, and they are against the hard fork. There are also some overly idealistic academics that oppose it.
[At this point the male interviewer emphasizes that he agrees with the point that those who oppose hard forks must want alt coins to succeed]
- If only the segwit part of segwit2x gets activated, we will end up with a sidechain [I think the Korean interpreter was confused, and I can't follow the last sentence].
- Regarding BCC, it was originally designed as a counter-measure against the UASF around April. But now Bitmain has decided to go with Segwit2x. BCC is no longer in our hands, and is now carried on by other people, not Bitmain.
[There is a final question, but the video cuts out before it got interpreted into Korean]
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:12:07


Thank you as well.


I don't think you understand what I'm saying, so let's assume for a second that what you say will happen. A miner illegitimately spends a segwit transaction without supplying any witness data, and mines it into a block. A bunch of blocks are mined on top of it, because miners aren't validating.
A while later, the miner sends his freshly mined coins to an exchange in order to sell them on the market. The exchange runs a segwit-compatible full node. Will they accept the transaction? No, because the full node rejects the blocks.
Is there any part of this you disagree with?


The answer is no, and this problem is unrelated to segwit, since it also exists in another form: What if a miner mines a transaction for which the input can't be found? Is the chain still valid?
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:20:29


Pay nodes in bitcoin and you'll get a free market where less popular stuff will cost more. And the nice thing is that unlike bittorrent, the uploader doesn't have to be the user. It can be anyone with a lot of disk space and bandwidth who wants to rent it out. If you add encryption the nodes won't even be able to tell what (possibly illegal) content they are providing.

Every time you sign something with your private key, you have to generate a random *k* value. If you use the same *k* value twice or a hacker is somehow able to determine which *k* value you used, they can derive your private key from your signatures.
Deterministic signatures are a way to utilize the randomness of your private key to ensure that your *k* value is random.

Actually, Poelstra is also [working on on the technology that enables Liquid](
Obviously this is not the fully decentralized bitcoin model, but it is still very useful in terms of providing a second layer solution that doesn't rely on trusting a single third party. It's a sort of distributed trust, where every participant only has partial influence.
I'm with you on wishing there was a fully decentralized way to do sidechains, but the solutions simply aren't there yet. What was proposed in the original sidechains paper can easily be exploited by miners.
Drivechains look promising, and a number of concerns that are currently being hashed out on the mailing list, but the trust model still relies on miners to some extent.
I heard research is being done on getting sidechains to work with zk-SNARKs, but this is probably going to take a while longer.

What I said goes for segwit as a soft fork. If you do segwit as a hard fork, you could move the segwit commitment out of the coinbase transaction, which would mean covert ASICBoost still works even if segwit transactions are mined.

The transaction would be invalid and anyone running a full node will reject the block.


Disregarding invalid signature data would mean the block is invalid and anyone running a full node will reject the block.


Censoring transactions and orphaning blocks is the worst thing &gt;51% can do.


This is incorrect. You always need a valid signature.


Incorrect. Full nodes reject invalid blocks, no matter how long the chain is.


You missed why full nodes are important. They protect ALL the rules in bitcoin. If only miners ran full nodes, &gt;51% could break almost every rule in bitcoin, not just segwit.
Everything I wrote above is true, but there is one thing you are right about. If none of the users and companies had upgraded and ran old full nodes that did not enforce segwit, then miners could have attacked in the way you described. However, this is [not the case (80%+ upgraded)](

Great work. This sounds easier than setting up Tor for Bitcoin Core. Would a similar setup be possible?

Thank you for your thorough answer.


HW1 does not come with a Security Card. Is this step optional?

If anything I'm happy you are thinking about it a lot. Regardless of whether or not you acknowledge my thoughts as correct, thank you for thinking about it deeply.


No matter what the example, it always comes back to this: does whoever is validating the block chain run a segwit compatible full node (i.e. Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 or later)? Example: if you use Mycelium Android wallet (non-SPV), this means you rely on them to tell you the state of the blockchain. If they run a segwit full node, miners can't steal your segwit transactions. [Here's a list]( Note that the wallet does not need to be able to produce segwit transactions in order to enforce the segwit rules.


They can already do that with SPV. I think a lot of your segwit-specific concerns apply to bitcoin in general. I think that's a good way to learn. Think about the ways it can be broken, and figure out whether it works. Miners can cheat if nobody checks them, that is why exchanges have to run a full node.


This is a misconception. The signatures are part of the proof-of-work inside a merkle tree. Nothing about it is complicated. If you receive a block with missing signatures, your segwit full node will consider it invalid.


It does not matter to full nodes. Until they have all the data, the block will be considered invalid.


Signatures can only be pruned after they are verified, so you need to receive them first. And pruning already exists today for spent transactions, it is not new to segwit.


If you are concerned, I recommend you run a full node without pruning. This way you won't have to depend on anyone. And I do not believe this will ever be a concern. All it takes is for one person to be willing to keep a copy and share it.


As pointed out above, segwit data is also part of the proof-of-work. Only non-segwit full nodes will accept missing segwit data. I will stop quoting you here, because the rest of your arguments build on this misconception. But let me know if there's anything you think I didn't address.
**I will mention one possible attack that I think supports your case:**
Miners can fool non-segwit full nodes. I think this is what your concern boils down to, so let's examine it.
- A miner needs to create a segwit-invalid block with a transaction to a business that is secured by a non-segwit full node
- That business needs to either accept the transaction before the block gets orphaned, or 51% of miners need to be building on top of it
- This attack is only profitable if the profit gained from the fraud is higher than the losses occurred from making invalid blocks (roughly 14 btc per block).
- Note that this same attack works against SPV wallets as well, and is not unique to segwit
I personally don't think the above is likely to happen, but it does emphasize the importance of businesses running segwit full nodes (either directly or indirectly).

Making replay protection optional is not a bad policy. Users might have funds in locktime contracts that would otherwise become unspendable on the new chain. 
What they should do is make the OP code that segwit uses invalid. That way segwit users automatically get replay protection.

Anyone running a segwit full node will reject the block. Miners can choose to risk mining on top of it, but they risk their block getting rejected as well.


Peter Rizun assumes hash rate is more important than full node rule enforcement. Listen to what he says [27 minutes into the video](
If you disagree with him on this, his whole argument falls flat. If you agree I have some bad news: miners can break the network in many other ways that are unrelated to segwit (e.g. oops, a miner spent some non-segwit coins with an invalid signature, but we already mined lots of blocks on top of it because of headers-first mining, so please update your software and follow the hash rate).
Peters ways of arguing seems very disingenuous to me, because he starts from one blatantly incorrect assumption that's easy for others to miss, and then builds a plausible narrative on top of it. A tower of truth, built on the foundation of a single falsehood.






That is only true if 51% of the miners is honest. If 51% is dishonest, miners can spend any coins they like and SPV wallets would accept it as valid (in SPV only PoW + merkle tree branch gets checked, nothing else).


A segwit full node absolutely does not make that assumption. Doing so would bring you back to SPV security, so then why even bother running a full node at all? For a block to be valid, you need everything including witness data, and you check both the transaction merkle tree and witness merkle tree.




1. A mines 12.5 BTC
2. A signs for 12.5 BTC to B
3. B signs for 12.5 BTC to C
A full node has to witness all these events (creation of coins, sending to B, sending to C) to know whether C is the rightful owner. But after you determined that for yourself, you no longer need to keep 1. and 2. This is how pruning works today (without segwit), and what you are left with is essentially a UTXO set. Because of this, my full node today is only ~2 GB in size. The only downside is that my node can no longer send this data to new full nodes that want to verify the history for themselves.
So then what exactly does segwit prune, you might ask? Well, because signatures are now separated from the transaction, you can further prune transaction 3 from "B signs for 12.5 BTC to C" to simply "12.5 BTC to C", for roughly another 40% space saving on your hard disk.


If you assume that, then really everything is secure. Nobody can lie to you if your full node is verifying what they tell you.


They need to be there for new full nodes. Everyone needs to check everything from the beginning if they want to independently verify whether no cheating has occurred. Or perhaps your node simply went offline for a while and you want to catch back up.


Now you're talking :) This is basically the data miners use for headers-first mining. 
And though a bit more advanced, this is roughly what Peter Todd and others are working with TXO commitments. Basically instead of everyone keeping a full UTXO set, you prune that as well (AFTER verifying, of course). When someone wants to spend a UTXO, they send you additional data that proves to you that it was part of the UTXO set.
This is why I am fully on board with the Core developers. When you dig into it, you realize they have an amazing understanding of this complex technology and are working on really cool improvements.

Not if 51% of miners support the soft fork. Soft forks can be imposed on the network by miners. Users would need to change nodes to do anything about it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:18:28


The world doesn't have to roll back, miners do. Nobody is moving forward if miners produce invalid blocks.


You seem to be misunderstanding something, full nodes rejecting invalid blocks completely refutes the attack.


That is true for bitcoin and PoW in general. You also seem to be misunderstanding your concerns with segwit.


The risk is that they produce or build on invalid blocks and won't get paid. The cost of potentially being orphaned is higher than the cost of validating transactions (even a four year old laptop can do that).
You say you understand that the blocks are invalid, but you seem to ignore that every user, company, exchange, etc. running a full node will reject these blocks and miners won't get paid.
Hopefully you understand now what I am saying. Feel free to ask more questions if something else isn't clear to you.

So the big blockers are going ICO. I guess Roger must have known about this, considering [his tweet]( 
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:37:48




What you are missing is that both chains are valid according to the rules of old nodes (otherwise it wouldn't be a soft fork), so the longest chain will be followed.
If a majority of miners supports the extension block, it won't cause a fork (other than old nodes briefly accepting the invalid block until it gets orphaned).

I believe there's a 7-11 at the airport in Seoul, so it may be interesting to convert your remaining Korean won into bitcoins before leaving the country.
Since 7-11 takes a cut, it's probably cheaper to use one of the 2-way ATMs in Seoul. There's one in Coffee Sedona (COEX Mall) and another one in Korea University.

I don't think most of the answers here are accurate. Covert ASICBOOST still works after segwit is activated. Segwit is backwards compatible, so non-segwit blocks can still be created.
One could argue it becomes less covert though, because creating blocks without segwit transactions is a pretty big hint.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:20:36
Yeah, we'll see if that is enough to disincentivize ASICBOOST.
