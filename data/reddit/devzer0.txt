if you have free electricity then you can be making something with your GPU, but i recommend alt-coins for GPU mining. If your electricity isn't free and you don't live in the pacific northwest you will running at a loss even with the alt-coins.

me too, no payouts for 2 days, this morning i wrote to support, even knowing they don't work weekends, shortly after they put up a sign saying some customers didn't get payouts for 2 days, 
and shortly few minutes after i saw a payout on my account for today but it was not the usual amount and then i noticed one of the bitcoin pools were missing under my allocations, 
but regardless of wat it maybe this is getting really scary 
i am getting worried about this company, i invested a good chunk and was going to double it, but now i am all worried

not if it affects me personally, they can develop whatever they want but not money, understand that money != software. until bitcoin there was no connection here, but with crypto becoming popular this is a very important thing that everyone needs to understand 
when crypto software acts as a constitution and the developers become  law makers, senator all combined  this equation doesn't include the citizens who are us who have invested money into it. So you are hailing on a dictatorship thinking its a utopian dream. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN DECIDING TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION WITH NO REGARD TO THE CITIZENS MONEY IS NOT LIBERAL ACT. ITS A SELFISH DICTATORSHIP ACT.  THE MONEY HAD GAINED VALUE UNDER A CONSTITUTION THAT WORKED WELL. JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW TO CODE AND FIND REAONS TO IMPROVE THINGS IT DOESN'T APPLY WHEN IT COMES TO COIN DEVELOPMENT. YOU ARE CHANGING A CONSTITUTION WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE CITIZENS. HOPE THAT WENT THROUGH YOUR THINK SKULL
