Ahh okay seed phrase is with hardware or software walkets?  i was told to do blockchain
@_date: 2019-08-21 02:16:29
essentially the coinbase app  is the exchange where i can actively buy and sell btc. what i have a hard time conceptualizing is how different a wallet is from a third party miner or exchange. with what you’re saying i gotta have a friend send my btc to add to my wallet if i wanna move btc from an exchange to a wallet which is weird cause i would keep needing their help everytime i wanna move btc to a wallet

i been seeing that. What i was asking was if i ise blockchain right i would have to use a friend to send me bc i have ao i can add it to the wallet on blockchain?

say i wanna invest in something and i need maybe 5-8k i would take it from btc but thats after building it up that high or i shouldn’t soend it at all

Thank you i was confused about that. But basically i been hearing coinbase isn’t that good and its safer to have a wallet from another place.

wat service do you use then?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:50:48

when viewing my wallet ?
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:30:16
ahh okay i shouldnt be concerned because i showed i have 0.00108200 but it shows up as 0.001082 now but removing extra zeros is what happened which is fine. cool.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:44:58
ahh imma read up on it. so i should wait 5 days till the transactions are added to my account before seeing if i was robbed?
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:01:48
yeah i did but before i bought from them i have a higher amount of coin than 0.001080  thats why im confused cause it didn’t happen before unless there’s new rules.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:02:59
yeah bank history matches the history on the purchases. im not sure what 2fa is?
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:12:54
ah very well then what confused me was that the purchases was adding the zeroes as if they were relevant
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:26:29
lmao how come?
