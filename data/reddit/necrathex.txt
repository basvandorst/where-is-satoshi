Consider it a bug bounty ;)

Actually no. The deposit timer is short because the price is fixed. Your deposit is accepted as soon as your (unconfirmed) transaction is propagated. You only need to wait for confirmations before getting paid out.

We considered creating the outputs without a private key, but then it would be trivial for a miner to hijack the transaction, as well as open up the the puzzle solutions to brute force attacks. That's why we keep the private key private.

Not really instabuy if you have to go through an extensive verification process though, is it?

Yes. Furthermore, at bitonic.nl there is a 10 minute window in which the price you pay (or get) for your bitcoins is fixed. Also bear in mind that the given price includes all fees (ideal/exchange fee).

They matter mainly for providing an entry point and giving support to new users, as well as for more experienced traders.

We provide a form on the website below each puzzle where you can submit the solution and your bitcoin address, the first to submit the correct solution will receive a transaction with the respective output.

Too low fee to propagate properly, or too low amount? Send me a pm if you want it checked out :)

seems to be the hardest puzzle yet, 53 minutes in and still no solution :)

The instant funding option iDEAL is really interesting, especially since it is available to everyone in the EU by opening a Dutch SEPA at bunq.com

Hi, Bitonic co-founder here. As far as I can tell we did not miss any payments, but as was mentioned here before we cant do payouts in the weekends, so if your sale came in after friday 12pm payout will happen monday (expected payout time is also dinplayed in your transaction details).
Of course it's possible something went wrong, in that case please contact us via email: contact or any other means we have available on our website and we'll look into it asap.

Unsurprisingly because bip42 is an (excellent) April fool's joke :)
