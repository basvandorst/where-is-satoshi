I honestly think that forums and reddit dont react fast enough to the way crypto moves. I am a big fan of Discord and Slack to stay up to date and I like the real time interaction. [I hang out here in this discord]( I like it because the majority of the members are crypto nerds like me who are extremely active in the market. Questions are answered quickly and TA charts are posted all the time. I always have something to read or talk about here
