Going by the graph, if people invest in it now, expect to see a 1/3 increase if you wait by 2021.

As for me, I lost myself $20 (or $30 had I traded it at its peak). This is terrifying.

I have nothing to announce at this time.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:39:45
I just did.

I have done what you asked: post here. The poll doesn't end until Wednesday at 4:00, and you are one of few people who called me out supporting other subreddits sharing the post.

Sorry if I'm not what you're looking for.

Did I announce anything now?

I never posted saying, "Bitcoin Cash will be the drawing blockchain for the subreddit." I did not announce anything related to that. I did, however, admit my bias, I did use it without telling anyone when doing the 32^nd Draw, and I did not call out any people who believed that Bitcoin Cash will be used for future drawings. However, by no means will I retract my stance. This is, in what I believe is, the honest truth from me.
Also, because I need to repeat it: **I plan to make an announcement, but I have nothing to announce at this time.**
*Edit:* Added and changed more words.

I am not affiliated with the yours.org page in any way, and I have nothing to announce at this time.

Because the point of is not to give someone a million dollars, but to spread the joy of *giving* money to those in need. Cryptocurrencies are capable of doing that, give to anyone in the world and help them, and restarting a subreddit focused on spreading generosity can make the world a better place and someone's day brighter.
*Edit:* Added a word.

That is because I was called out by a user, which prompted a notification in my inbox. I paid little heed to the content actually posted, as I was being accused of encouraging brigading at the time.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:15:02
I said that I am okay with anybody posting elsewhere.

Thank you for your support, and I'm sorry for losing your trust, at this point and any future things I do.
