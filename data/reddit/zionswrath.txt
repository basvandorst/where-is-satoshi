So all those local bitcoin arrests shouldn't have happened.
What he did is the same thing.
I would agree saying I don't think it is illegal and I think it should not be considered illegal. But apparently it is, at least for the time being.
Excuse the late reply I haven't check my reddit message in a while.

Well in their defense what you did is technically illegal. And was pretty silly of you to put Bitcoin in the comment. What's that nail that sticks out gets hammered thing?
You heard of that acting as a money transfer service or something like that they have been getting those local bitcoin guys with.
Also, FYI banks file SARs (suspicious activity reports) so don't be surprised if you get audited or something.
