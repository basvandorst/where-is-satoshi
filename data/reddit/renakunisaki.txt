I think Bitcoin is a great idea and proof of concept, but is more like a beta test than a usable product. It hasn't scaled the way people expected, which has revealed some issues.
* 10 minutes is pretty slow. People suggest that you'd avoid this by putting coins into an "account" at a particular retailer and spending out of that, but that ends up either being "too complicated" or just creating central banks.
* The block chain grows way too large. Every node must keep a copy and download every transaction; every new node must download the entire chain. For a file that's dozens of gigabytes and constantly growing, that's a huge strain on networks, and on storage for some smaller devices. (Who wants to dedicate half of their phone's storage to block chain?) Also, this means devices must be constantly "awake" to receive updates (or update when prompted, which could take a while due to the size).
* People advertise it as anonymous and untraceable, when it's really not that difficult to track. This is a social problem (Bitcoin doesn't claim to be untraceable, only misinformed people do) but still an issue.
* It's very easy to lose or steal. Its main feature is also a major weak point. Someone need only swipe a small file from your hard drive (or trick you into handing it over or using one they control) and now they can, potentially much later, empty your wallet, and there's no way to recover. If your credit card gets stolen, the company can usually track down and bust the thief and reverse the charges, but if your Bitcoins get stolen, you're screwed.
* Protecting them requires a fair bit of technical knowledge and inconvenience. Things like disk encryption and cold storage fly over most folks' heads.
* Scams are *everywhere*. Huge exchanges handling millions of dollars worth of BTC have got "hacked" (and had terrible security infrastructure) or just vanished.
* The block chain is very susceptible to spam in the form of tons of tiny transactions. This has been happening even with legitimate uses such as casinos and microtransactions, where sending small amounts back and forth is normal.
* The 21 million limit leads to hoarding. Other coins have implemented fixed inflation rates instead (x new coins are generated every y time), which seems like a good idea for "real world" use.
* The protocol to me seems overcomplicated. It's this whole scripting language. The idea of such complexity in a security-critical context makes me ill.

Seems legit.
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:42:11
Agreed. Bitcoin's biggest issue is that it's so easy to steal or scam, and there's nothing you can do to get it back. Experienced users know how to use it safely, but for the average Joe it's complicated and scary. Plus so many big exchanges "got hacked" or just disappeared.
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:38:08
It's suspicious. Usually you rarely see long hex strings like that, and there would be a comment explaining it. Plus, an experienced coder will immediately recognize that the bytes are ASCII letters, which don't need to be encoded.
That draws the eye, and then the rest is clearly up to no good, opening a network connection to somewhere.

@_date: 2014-04-20 23:26:55
So then we're back to the existing fustercluck where the "trusted" authorities are people you never heard of and you have to pay them to verify your key. Not really an ideal system.
The other idea I've often heard is a web of trust system. People ask their trusted peers to verify that this is your correct key. But this has the issue of getting off the ground. Someone who's just got into the game might not have any trusted peers they can exchange keys with.

On the subject of digital signatures, I've never been 100% clear on how they work. I always thought they worked the opposite of encryption - i.e. what would be the private key is now the public key, and vice-versa, and that means that anyone can decrypt the message using the "private" key (which is actually public), but only one person can encrypt a message that will decrypt with that key, using their "public" key (which is actually private).
However I also heard of a different system, that involves something like encrypting a hash of the message and including that encrypted hash with the plaintext message. I'm not sure how that works, though.
Am I understanding any of this correctly?
@_date: 2014-04-21 01:35:13
Eh, I'm still unclear how the keys are used. Which parts am I wrong on?
1. Given two keys A and B, A can be used to encrypt a message such that it can only be decrypted with B.
2. A can only be used to encrypt, and B can only be used to decrypt.
3. If I give out A and keep B secret, then anyone can encrypt a message, and only I'll be able to read it.
4. If I give out B and keep A secret, then I can encrypt messages which anyone will be able to read, and the fact that they decrypt correctly using B proves that they were encrypted with A.

I don't understand why every website owner expects everyone else to pay for their site. If you want a website so bad, you should be willing to pay for it like you would have to pay for literally anything else. If you can get some ad money and/or donations to cover/lessen the cost, that's great, but you shouldn't expect those to cover 100% of expenses.

I kinda dislike the terms public and private key, because they can be swapped if you're talking about signing. I'd rather call them encryption key and decryption key, or write key and read key. One is needed to write a message which can only be read using the other. In crypto you distribute the write key (so anyone can write messages which only you can read); in signing you distribute the read key (so anyone can read messages which only you can write).

Then presumably it makes money by selling a product or service; i.e. what a business does. But not all websites are businesses.
You're welcome to try treating digital information as a product (or treating access to it as a service) and charging for access to it, e.g. with a paywall or a distribution service. If you make it more convenient than getting the same information for free elsewhere, you might do well. Netflix is an example.
You're *not* welcome to sell *me* just because I accessed your site.

That, plus Dogecoin's low value makes it more appealing to use for things like Reddit tips. You can just tip someone 25 or 50 or 100 doge. With Bitcoin, even 1BTC is a lot of money, so you have to either manage decimals carefully (which is a bit difficult) or choose am amount in USD (which somewhat defeats the point of a new currency).
Humans manage integers better than decimals. Is 10 TheoreticalCoins a lot? 100? 1000? How about 0.1, 0.01, 0.0001? You start having to really count the zeros and think about it, which makes it less fun. Of course you can use mBTC and Satoshis, but that still requires a bit of mental math (how much is 10000 mBTC?).
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:18:30
So you consider your website to be a business that sells information or convenient access to it. That's fine. You may find that difficult (since digital information is infinitely reproducible, what you're really selling is a more convenient/legal/moral way to get it than the free alternatives), but you're welcome to try. Just understand that selling things isn't the only reason for a website to exist. Some people run them just because they want to. Some people *are* running charities (Wikipedia). Either way, don't expect advertising to cover 100% of the cost.

Like I said, you're welcome to treat digital content as a product and try to make a business around that. Believe it or not though, some people really do run websites for reasons other than profit, such as:
* as a hobby (e.g. blogs)
* as a non-profit service (e.g. Wikipedia)
* as a publishing medium (i.e. free to read, pay to submit/promote, e.g. Reddit, which allows you to promote posts in the box at the top of the page; news sites that run promotional articles)
If none of those work for you, then, like I said, you can always try to turn your site into a business by:
* treating the content as a product for sale (i.e. paywalls)
* treating *access to* and *delivery and organization of* existing content as a service (e.g. Netflix)
* offering some/all of the content for free plus a related paid service (e.g. Reddit Gold which adds more features; porn sites which have some free and some paid content)
Those are all fine, and plenty of businesses use them. The only method I'm *not* OK with is making money by selling your users to advertisers.

No, I can't imagine a scenario where you could safely give out both keys. But what you could do is:
* Generate two sets of keys: R1, W1, R2, W2.
* Give out R1, so that anyone can read a message which you encrypt with W1.
* Give out W2, so that anyone can encrypt a message with it, which only you can read (with R2).
* When you give out W2, sign it with R1. The receiver can then be sure (assuming they can trust R1) that this is your W2 and not some middleman's key.
Now anyone can use R1 to verify a message you sign using W1, and anyone can use W2 to encrypt a message you read with R2.
Of course, there's still the question of how to safely give out R1.

That's actually a fair point. Just because content is available online doesn't necessarily mean it has to be free. Movies are an example; they can be found online, but not (legally) for free.
Ultimately though, it all comes back to the question of why you want a website. Do you want to run an online business selling digital content or access to it? Go ahead and charge for access. Not every website is a business selling content, though. Some people have websites just because they want to, e.g. blogs. The problem isn't when you're selling the content, it's when you're selling the consumers. You're allowed to ask me to pay to read your blog post, but you're not allowed to sell my information.
As for why people expect online content to be free, it's probably largely because charging for digital content itself doesn't make a lot of sense. Information is not a consumable good - anyone can duplicate it infinitely - and it's not, itself, a service. It's like telling someone a recipe, and saying now you owe me $1 for that information and you're not allowed to tell anyone else. Information doesn't work that way. This is demonstrated by such things as DRM's incredible ineffectiveness and the Streisand Effect. Once information is in digital form, it *will* spread around, outside of anyone's control, as long as people want it.
What you *can* do is charge for *convenient access* to digital content. This is what Netflix does. It doesn't eliminate piracy; it provides a more convenient way to get the same content. The more convenient it is to pay you for the content than to Google for it, the better.
What makes access "convenient" depends on the person. Different people assign different values to things like:
* Being a *legal* way to get the content (breaking the law is inconvenient because then they have to worry about getting caught)
* Being easy to find the content they want
* Being easy to download and consume the content
* Being able to save a copy for themselves, instead of having to re-download it from your site every time
* Price (cheaper = more convenient, especially for people who don't have credit cards and thus can't easily buy things online)
* Providing good, quality content (pirated content is often of inferior quality)
Not everyone will pay. Some people don't care if it's legal and are willing to take the time to find a decent pirated copy. But plenty of pirates still use Netflix, because they find it more convenient than piracy.
The problem with advertising is that you're still selling information - but instead of selling digital content to consumers, you're selling your viewers' information to advertisers, and that isn't yours to sell. Ad blockers are a mechanism to prevent that. Of course they typically block *all* ads, because there's no way to know which ones are collecting information and which aren't.
Some people are fine with that. Some aren't. Some advertisers acknowledge this and provide an "opt out" function, but it's impossible to use that without first going to their website, at which point you've already given them a bunch of information you were trying to opt out of giving them. And there's no way to verify that the option actually does anything. Ad blockers turn them into an "opt in" in the only way that can possibly be reliable: by not giving them any information in the first place. (Or they can still be used as an "opt out" by disabling filter subscriptions and only blocking things manually, but then you'll easily miss hidden tracking bugs.)
**tl;dr** if you don't want to provide content for free, you don't have to. But what's *not* okay is selling *my* information.

I wish you could buy small (32MB-1GB) microSD cards and USB sticks for like a dime a dozen. So handy for just handing out a couple files or leaving them hidden somewhere and not caring if you get them back.
Alas, I suspect most of the cost is in manufacturing and materials, so to make a 32MB stick today probably still costs as much as a 16GB.

People hate paywalls because they're done wrong. They're trying to charge for information. They should be charging for convenient access. For $x/month you can read all this info right here instead of having to look for it elsewhere.
The real problem with paywalls isn't even that they exist but that they're sprung on people like a trap. Someone finds an article, thinks it's interesting, links it to other people, and some/all of those people only see a paywall. Or you read part of an article or a couple articles and then they spring it on you. That's the classic "pay me to stop annoying you" model that people know and despise. "That's a nice article you got there, be a shame if something were to happen to the end of it..."

Well, you could certainly print it as a QR code. It wouldn't be very stealthy, but a computer could read it easily. So the question becomes how well can you hide/disguise such a code before the computer can no longer read it (even with help, eg cropping and rotating the image)?

It's the same idea. Try to interfere with ad blockers or respond differently when they're in use; people will respond by adapting them to evade whatever method you're using. In the case you mentioned in another reply, you might try to detect it by measuring the size of an "ad" element to see if it's visible (or testing if it exists to see if the script created it successfully); blockers will work around it by hiding it some other way, or patching/blocking that script.

Having a Bitcoin address connected to your account wouldn't enable hackers to steal your Bitcoin, any more than having an email address connected to the account would enable hackers to read your email. Bitcoin addresses and email addresses are both public* addresses that can only be used to determine where to send things to. Having the address alone doesn't allow you to control the account.
Now, if Reddit *hosted* your email, then yes, hacking your account would mean full access to your email. And if Reddit hosted your Bitcoin wallet, hacking your account would mean full control over your Bitcoin. That's why they most likely won't be doing that. Changetip does host a wallet for you so that it can send from that wallet on your behalf, but that's only a convenience feature; there's no reason Reddit would *have* to host a wallet for you.

1\. It's complicated.  
"But it's really simple!" you say. "You just paste/scan the address, enter the amount, and hit send!" Sure, once you have everything installed and set up, and the latest blockchain downloaded, and you've read about how the whole thing works and how you get an address and how to be safe and how confirmations work and where to use them and how to get them, *then* it can be simple. To the average Joe who barely even understands how to send and receive email, Bitcoin may as well be rocket science.
2\. The community is toxic. Scams and shitty attitudes *everywhere*. So many of the big exchanges suddenly disappeared, got hacked, or were just plain scams. Who can you trust? And it being anonymous, virtually untraceable, and irreversible - all the things that make scams so easy - are *features*!
3\. The blockchain is really not scalable. It just grows and grows and grows. It's already dozens of gigabytes and just keeps getting bigger. That also makes it effectively unusable on slow connections. Even once you have the chain downloaded, the constant connections and transfers just choke the connection to death.
4\. It's a closed loop. How do you get BTC in the first place? See point 2.
Bitcoin still has some major usability issues.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:55:53
Seeing that a lot lately, yet people don't think about it. Some organization dislikes an existing product/service (AdBlock, uTorrent, Bitcoin) so they either buy it out or create their own version with a confusingly similar name (Bitcoin Classic), make it untrustworthy, and let the original product suffer. People no longer trust the original (or other existing, legit versions, eg other ad blockers) because they heard you can get viruses from them or they heard that particular name (or something like it) was bad.
Linus was fortunately insightful enough to trademark the name Linux (though for different reasons IIRC) to prevent that kind of abuse; other products and services need to consider the same risk.
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:12:02
Problem is even the ad blockers are selling out or being the victim of FUD. That is, people don't trust even the good ones, because they can't tell which is which.

No. It's a great concept but in practice it needs a lot more polish. It hogs bandwidth, CPU, RAM, and disk space, it's way too easy to get scammed or robbed, the community is toxic, and even just getting and spending bitcoin is difficult.

Incidentally, what I *dislike* most is how damn difficult it is to convert between BTC and any other currency. (And there's not much you can buy with BTC, but that's slowly changing.) So it's kind of a catch-22.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:13:53
I think it's not a whole lot different. It aims for 2.5 minutes to process a block rather than 10, which is nice, but I don't think cryptocurrencies can completely replace fiat currencies until they catch up in speed. A cash transaction can be a simple matter of handing over a bill, and a debit transaction can complete in 10 seconds. Nobody wants to wait 2.5 minutes for their payment to go through in line at the grocery store.
Otherwise, it seems to be largely the same thing as Bitcoin. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think after a few years, people will identify more ways Bitcoin can be improved, and eventually develop a new system that implements those improvements.
I like Primecoin, for the fact that its computations have a scientific value, and aren't simply hard for the sake of being hard. Though I haven't studied it in detail, so I can't say how suitable prime number calculation is for this purpose.
