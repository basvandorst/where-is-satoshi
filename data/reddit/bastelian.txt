If you don't yet want to go the Swiss banks route, how far can you go with Bitcoin-backed credit cards like BitPay card or Cryptopay? Seems like you could buy most of daily necessities with those. What about larger purchases?
In other words, what can you not buy? You can [rent]( or [buy]( yachts with Bitcoin. You can buy [real estate]( Etc.
What exactly is the appeal of cashing out into Swiss Banks? I can see,
1. buying things the seller isn't willing to accept Bitcoin for (duh)
2. holding fiat to protect from the Bitcoin price going down
Anything else? How much of the problem is 1. in practice, now that more and more people want to get into Bitcoin?
