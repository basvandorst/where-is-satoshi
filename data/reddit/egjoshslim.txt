If you would like to take civil action against them in the UK, i can help. I operate and live in the UK. If they took you for deformation they will lose. As a financial company they should have insurance in place if they are operating out of the UK. Egjoshslim By all means message me and we can proceed from there. If they want to play the civil lawsuit game then i hope they have a solicitor. I already do.

Pokertravis is a little pussy who no doubts gets picked on ever time he leaves the house. (which i assume is never now) he probably gets between 0 and fuck all female attention which would explain his huge frustrations towards people on the internet. no doubt rooted in his deeply troubled relationship with his father that stems from a need to feel love from a father that never cared.
Plus he THINKS he understands "bitcoin" what ever the fuck that means. I assume you mean the blockchain. Pokertravis THINKS he posseses some intelligence because he knows a little about bitcoin and how the blockchain which is behind it works.
It is not confirming because the fee is equal or below that of the other 25k unconfirmed transactions. i have 2. 
The reason bitcoin isn't more mainstream and inturn much more valuable is because of raging little cunts like travis who need a really strong punch to the lower jaw. Which he no doubt will receive by being such a little weak pussy. Travis is a fucking weak name. Sounding like a fucking old lady travis.
