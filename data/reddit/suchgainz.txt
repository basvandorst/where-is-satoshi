Also true!
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:33:56
Correct, the hype is dying, the amount of tx's being made is is the same as december 2016
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:51:33
Same here!
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:35:50
A wild Fee has appeared!
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:13:22
Ofcourse that would be an important question...
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:17:14
If you see already the downvotes because you speak the truth... wth,
Since 2015 it was known that the blocks were getting filled up, yet the supposedly best devs in the world possibly contracted by blockstream didn't do a single thing about it.
That's not good software development imo
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:44:25
You got my upvote!
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:41:44
And now you can only use "that" channel only to "that" other user/merchant/service provider
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:43:55
Why would you want to add the LN layer if you could just increase the blocksize and make everything work again?
Hmmm I wonder.........
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:03:31
I'm wondering how many merchants would use LN, merchants want to get paid and should therefore close the channel to receive the funds to purchase new goods for example
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:15:50
Ah look, they're just on the edge of a circle now
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:54:36
They should use another crypto instead, tx fees are too high
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:01:34
Does it crumble?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:45:01
I'm not sure which altcoins died, except for BITCONNEEEeE,
And yes: IF btc succesfully implements.
Everyone was shouting that LN wouldn't be centralized, there are currently 3-4 nodes which are like a main hub....
 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:29:03
It's the same with bitcoin.org, the website still calls it a cheap peer-to-peer currency.
Well, it ain't that
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:42:26
Well, the bitcoin.org website changed their frontpage. The cheap part has been deleted :p
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:23:00
Why would a 1$ transaction be silly? If the blockchain is being used as a peer-to-peer currency it doesn't matter.
The bitcoin.org website still states that btc is a digital currency with low fees. Well, it isn't, it's being used as digital gold.
If btc starts another run,people will flow back into the crypto space and tx fees will sky rocket again
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:12:30
Here we go again..
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:37:51
That's how we roll
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:45:14
The asking price with on top of that the current fee
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:53:05
I got 99 coins but bitcoin aint one, lol
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:51:47
Bitcoin Cash is like bitcoin before it was cool
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:51:03
Apparently it was a stresstest of some sort, anyway everything worked fine :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:56:55
0.00088917 in fees LMAO
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:02:44
Good idea :') 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:02:26
[the draft ]( 
This draft still states in Paragraph 8.1.2 something different (see row 1062-1063)
When will they update their draft :-x ;-)

You get a loan, you get a loan, EVERYONE gets a loan!
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:39:07
Hehe, spot on!
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:42:17
This is so true!
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:59:08
By working product I obviously meant , working as a cryptocurrency, not as digital cold. 
Oh well never mind.
I should have said: "taken over" by a corporation, my bad
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:55:30
Bitcoin against the wall, Bitcoin cash rolling by waving hands..
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:42:45
You should give this a read:
Goldman Sachs ruins everything over and over again.
The same will happen in Crypto aswell at some point
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:24:25
Censorship resistant, try r/btc
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:25:36
Lately everyone was saying LN wouldn't be centralized, I'm just stating the obvious
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:49:43
Yeah sorry, I know what you mean ;)
Luckily there are other ways to pay with ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:31:24
Mempool already empty, just perfect
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:47:32
Litecoin is a fork from bitcoin right!?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:22:00
"Crumbling" gold
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:55:00
It depends on how you define a "product", anyway Bitcoins wasn't meant to be a store of value, it is created, by a group or corporation however you want to call it
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:28:59
I think you will be quicker when you would switch to a different "alt" coin
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:46:54
Did you give that article a read? I'm just saying, eventually the same thing will happen
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:47:07
"Massively connected central hubs"
I thought everyone here was fighting for decentralization...
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:56:05
Am I shadow banned? :p
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:11:18
[The draft online from nist]( 
Shows something different at row 1062-1063.
This twitter source I call BS. Not a reliable source
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:35:38
I was waiting for this, correct it's false.
However, the hops you need to make need to contain atleast the amount you want to send through.
What if you want to buy a car for example. I suppose not many people would have a lot of money in their channel.
Then you need hops with a lot of liquidity, What kind of hubs will that be?
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:04:51
Technically it's not legal, it is allowed.
Anyway, why would you buy a spliff (lets say 5€ pre-made)
Then you pay another 15€ or more for network fees.
That sticker must have been there for a long time....
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:53:37
Routed through banking hubs (decentralized), great
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:53:32
That's why they should visit the website and see how it works, It's pretty sad that we live in a world where bad shit happens.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:37:03
Hey, you inflate crypto properply or you do not! :')
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:30:20
LN is still in testphase
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:55:02
Glad you agree with me on that ;)
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:41:25
Let me rephrase: 
Alpha stage
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:39:58
Sounds a bit like staking, but Technically you're not Forging blocks.
Ah well, some people apparently already lost dome money in this alpha stage. Better use 0-conf instead
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:20:44
Define massive..
Adding 10$ fee for a 500$ tx, isn't using the banking system cheaper? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:07:36
Can we get a link to the revised draft then?
Bitcoin subreddit as a source is not a very strong source
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:41:45
Good twitter
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:38:05
Good that you think like that! Yes, there are actually users which are using and it's growing
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:18:33
Or he/she just wanted to spend their money...
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:06:52
That's what mainstream media does, only mentioning Bitcoin and nothing else
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:19:39
Have you seen it's mempool, it's near empty.
If you don't try your software to the fullest you never know if it works.
I call this progress :D
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:05:28
They are right you know, they took a different road than the whitepaper.
LN is a solution which seems not logical at all unless you use centralized hubs...
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:39:49
Why would you use your digital gold to buy a coffee?
EDIT: If you could use another cryptocurrency instead
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:29:50
I had the same thing 200k in pending Tx's :')
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:01:08
And create the BTCFee, I will invest!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:18:09
I really don't see how you can get a tax plan trough with just taxing one crypto. If the state wants to get money, the'll go after all crypto's.
On the other hand, I don't live in the U.S. so I don't get what they do. As long as my country doesn't follow like a stupid dog
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:41:28
Good, he found the real thing!
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:59:26
I just read a post in the cryptocurrency sub I believe it was.
IRS wants to know what you trade between crypto's aswell, good luck if you are a daytrader :')
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:33:28
This video is too short to really know what he is talking about. I haven't seen the full video..
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:43:36
Okay, to get this straight, if you open up a channel, can you transact with anyone or do you need a channel for every tx to another person?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:50:20
!Remind me in one year
How does that work.
Typical Bitcoin sub. 
Non working product is King right?!
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:56:42
I think the vacuum might already be filled by a few "altcoins"
Cryptoworld is going berserk!
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:04:37
A lot of people are complaining their portfolio drops because of some alts lately rising and the retracement of BTC.
Where I'm like: It's just a 10% drop in mine, so I guess some people don't diversify at all ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:15:40
Bitcoin Cash, because it works
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:09:55
Heavy moderated!
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:59:01
All the different channels you need to open with different persons or company's sound like a hassle to me eith thr lightning idea, from what I can understand
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:29:02
That's even better, they will be trying all your fake seeds xD
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:09:52
I am completely aware of that, I was just saying that because a lot of people are so eager to stick with the Legacy chain, which atm isn't really working properly imo
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:26:36
It's more like a caster to get your legs fixed!
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:09:55
Get rid if your debts and buy a house sounds much better!
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:54:50
If you never spend it, what's the use?
Buy a house or something!
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:47:55
Relax, it already says that blocks can scale in the future when necessary;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:00:16
Yes there should be, but there is too much hate from r/bitcoin to r/btc..
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:52:56
Thanks for the explanation, I'm not sure I can't agree with the fact you're saying it is super easy though.
There are a lot of limitations as I see it.
If opening up a channel would cost 500usd for example as a fee, you rather leave the channel open for a lifetime instead of closing it. If you open 20 channels to route your btc, that's still a lot of money
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:45:42
Shit I can't even make it to the second rule without using it xD
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:01:01
So you're saying that using an insane amount of power to get the tx's done is the best way?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:44:52
What will the purpose of high fees be? I don't like my money being stuck because I would find the fee to high to move it or use it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:09:29
Bad idea!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:22:14
It isn't lightning hubs will be provided by institutional investors imo xD
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:05:08
Pretty much the only thing you can do anyway, fees are to high :')
Mempool has an ATH aswell
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:49:57
More and more people are switching to btc because of the hating in r/ bitcoin. 
The same is starting over there I guess
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:08:11
TPB isn't what it used to be unfortunately
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:26:59
Fake, and if it's true. It's the most stupid thing ever
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:26:06
Hmm yes, might be true, depends on how well it is designed
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:13:37
Get the wallet, type a 12 word sentence kindly saying to them to fck off xD
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:26:23
Indeed nice explanation, I did know though :))
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:49:13
There is no Bitcoin Core right!? Lol
**Edit** Well that escalated quickly! :')
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:39:38
The agreement end in 2020, anyway ebay wants to provide options for their customer and **lower** fees.
Currently, Bitcoin is no good for that
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:40:03
Still in alpha fase though, for small amounts 0-comf is fine.
It's like giving someone a check in the old days ;)
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:08:49
Are those fans still running? I guess they will have a lot of drag in that *holy water*
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:36:31
As quick as 0-conf!
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:42:52
What he said
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:53:31
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:37:42
Are they secured in a wallet file locked with a password? If so: Create a hashfile from the file john the ripper does that and then run the hashfile with hashcat. 
The internet is your friend here :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:58:44
Less tx's, empty mempool, yes
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:39:48
I won't see it dying with the amount of adoption being realized.
People who want to invest should do proper research, instead of checking 2 websites.
But that's just my opinion
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:33:12
If it's on fox it must be true! ;)
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:33:39
The fact that this video has been edited says enough.... shills
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:39:53
Have you seen the shapeshift video, where you can exchange Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Cash :D
