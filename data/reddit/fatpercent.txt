Would you deny that there is huge problems on the Bitcoin chain right now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:10:19
Also, there's Graphene coming, new OP codes, smart contracts, etc etc etc. Talk about no innovation on the Bitcoin Cash chain?

What is bcash? What does the b in bcash stand for?

So the troubling thing here is the size of the blockchain? I can buy an 8 TB harddrive on amazon for like $150 USD. Even with constant 8 MB in growth every 10 minutes, this would be enough to store 8 MB blocks for 19 years. And harddrive space is constantly evolving!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:06:12
This seems reasonable. What makes Bitcoin Cash a shitcoin, then?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:22:06
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Doesn't sound like BTC
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:04:48
But what is the difference between it and BTC?

Great, so you get a $20 fine and pay $15 in fees on top. Revolutionary!
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:23:23
Buying Bitcoin is always worth it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:47:07
I didn't overdraft anything mate. PayPal charged my bank account for a transfer that did not happen and now imposes fees upon me for not letting them hold my money hostage.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:53:22
Correct. But they did not initiate a return for 5 days minimum. They did neither credit my PayPal account balance nor my bank account. That's the point
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:35:23
Does the FED control the state or does the state control the FED?

Why can't I hold all this bullshit?
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:13:43
FTFY  :)
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:25:09
- PayPal checks balance and queues a withdrawal from my bank account (note that this was done at like 2am)
- Both me and the seller cancel the transaction
- PayPal still withdraws from my account, overdraws it and does not credit me that fuckin 90 bucks back into either my bank account or my PayPal account balance
- Wait &gt;5 days, nothing happens
- Recall direct debit
- PayPal charges me a fee
@_date: 2014-10-12 13:13:44


That's some of the biggest bullshit I've read in a while. Bitcoin is used as money, therefore it is.
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:46:55

This is wonderful. Is there a way to donate?
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:53:03
There are people who can. Not that hard actually.

So, how does it feel to buy Bitcoins for 50x the price and having missed out on making thousands?

Good news everyone!

I really like seeing that, but buying Bitcoins with cash in the UK? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:58:59
If Bitcoin becomes the first global currency wealth will no longer be measured in dollars. We'll laugh at that for sure.

Should read 206 countries that could actually use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:54:23
I have a dream of a $3,50 hardware wallet for Bitcoin that can be used to transact currency from one state to another without the need for an internet connection.
This is what we need for mass adoption. This is the ultimate solution.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:35:48
Please stop this FUD! 25 Bitcoins are mined every 10 minutes, correct, but those Bitcoins are not sold off immediately!
Furthermore, consider the daily volume of the exchanges and rethink what you said.

@_date: 2014-08-28 23:00:26
Is this even possible?
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:50:36


Correct. OP wants a decentralization of money, not just a separation from the state.
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:31:19
Sounds good.
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:56:40
I'd rather donate directly to this project.

Finally be useful? Bitcoin is useful per definition. Wanna send 150 mio. bucks to fuckin Bangladesh on a Sunday night 3am? With Bitcoin you can.

Seen it coming in 2011
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:27:16
Sounds good. I'm just wondering if this site is javascript based? E.g. I'll sign it offline and broadcast it manually after it's signed. That way I don't have to reveal my private keys
@_date: 2016-05-16 01:55:22
Alright I have signed the transaction correctly using coinb.in and then after receiving that error message I watched this video here  which uses the localbitcoin block explorer to broadcast the new transaction (double spend) with a higher fee and now I'll just wait for my new transaction to be included in a block right?
Please, God, let me be right.
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:09:45
Yes it has worked. Just created a raw transaction (which took like half a fuckin hour to do) signed it with coinb.in with all private keys and then broadcasted it with the localbitcoin block explorer (which allows double spends to be broadcasted - how ironic).
Thank you very much
@_date: 2016-05-16 01:03:43
Okay I have created a raw transaction with all 21 inputs using coinb.in. Now I'll just have to sign that with the corresponding 21 private keys and broadcast the signed transaction, right? (:
@_date: 2016-05-16 01:40:58
Alright I figured out how to sign that raw transaction with my 21 private keys. Now I have this huge 4KB signed transaction that needs to be broadcasted. Blockchain.info won't let me do it (An outpoint is already spent in ...) and coinb.in says 'Could not push your transaction!' after having succesfully verified it on that site (all inputs are signed).
Where exactly can I do this? Seems like all those pages want to prevent a double spend ...
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:16:59
Thing is, I did not expect my transaction to be that large. Due to electrums shitty interface, I usually type in .0001 BTC as the standard fee for all transactions. When leaving that field blank, electrum automatically fills in the best possible transaction fee based on the size of your transaction. Now I tried to withdraw all BTC from my electrum wallet and the problem is, that when you type in your current balance which is displayed in the lower left  corner (digit after digit) the text displaying your balance changes to "not enough funds". Trying to withdraw your entire bitcoin balance at once and typing in the current amount of bitcoins you have leads to a constant change of the dynamic fee electrum shows which makes it impossible to withdraw your coins as the number of inputs increases as you type in more digits.
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:30:33
♥ much love. I'd tip you if I could. Guess I'll try that double spend thingy and rebroadcast with higher fee
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:23:57
I don't have any coins left right now but if this works, it might change my life
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:12:24
Received my withdrawal request (72%) about 1 week ago.

From site:
That's it, Sheep went down and BMR can't stand, so I'll describe here the procedure that will follow.
The shutdown procedure for BMR:
1. Registrations will be closed (done at 2013-12-01 02:00 UTC)
2. Deposit addresses will disappear (done at 2013-12-01 13:15 UTC)
3. People with zero balance AND no movements in history will no longer be able to login (done at 2013-12-01 17:15 UTC). Deposit processor gets shutdown in about 1 day.
4. One day after 3. people will be unable to further buy
5. The market will remain for a while until the deals and escrow complete, at least most of them.
6. Shortly after 5. the system will go to a complete shutdown.
* Remaining infrastructure, including this forum, will continue to operate.
* Withdraws may at some point delay a while, this is natural as I've to put back coins from the offline vaults back to the market (yes, steal 5 million out of BMR would be totally impossible), and the system requires 6 validations for vault money to become available. Be patient, the coins will not disappear, just take a while.
Further info:
    You can keep doing business as usual until the place where buying is no longer permitted. Up to then fulfill orders, buy, sell... just as a normal day.
    You're being given a foreclosure warning, I'm not running away or closing BMR tomorrow.
