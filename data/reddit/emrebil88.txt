I haven’t run into the issue myself but read about it in Twitter and Reddit.
Aspiration bank seems to a checking/saving. I’m traveling now but when I get steady/fast internet I will sign up for it.
I’m in the USA.

People with that status have security firms protecting them. Come on

��‍♂️ Did you look at the average transaction fee and attach an appropriate amount?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:28:35
I don’t understand the argument? Because you control your own assets you’re more  susceptible to theft? They only way I can see it being more susceptible to theft is with peoples lack of knowledge of IT security not physical threats.

Why would you carry the private keys on your person? 
I don’t have access to my private keys whenever I want. I hide them / encrypt them.

Such a shame, I had a savings, checking and credit card from CapitalOne. Now I have to rethink my position with the bank. ��
Will go with Aspiration Bank. Done ✅

You can have multiple wallets with decoy wallets with smaller percentage of your asset in it.

What if someone kidnapped your child and asked you for ransom? 
What if someone pointed a gun and asked you to make withdrawals from several different ATMs. 
What if someone stole your identity?
What if someone forged your check?
Etc etc etc

I’m not mad, I’m just debating. I don’t think it can be solved really. If it’s censorship resistant it would defeat the purpose if we were to be able to track the currency.

Can poloniex increase the transaction fee that was already broadcasted on the network?

Roger Ver is a whale.

What we witnessed yesterday were whales playing games. Had nothing to do with small players like you and I unless we were victims to their traps.

Bitcoin lost a little of its market share. What we witnessed were whales readjusting their positions.

There is a service called [VIABTC]( You can add extra fees to transactions to give miners incentive to confirm that transaction. This solved my problem.

Thank you for the responses so far. My answer to the argument was that a lot of people from low income families/ 3rd world countries do not have the requirements to open Paypal/Google wallet accounts due to lack of bank account.

What about when the trading pairs are using BTC or ETH. so You have ADA/BTC. How do you know when the action is a buy or sell. It gets confusing fast. When you have over 2k transactions with trading pairs like BTC/USD or ADA/BTC and every exchange uses a different side for the dominant trading pair.

The bags are getting heavy though....
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:17:01
It is an awesome idea. My calculations were off too so I’m trying to manually calculate my trades in excel which is why I wanted to easily read what is a buy or a sell. So far I’m just using this platform to consolidated all my transfers and trades between exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:39:19
Yes, it makes sense. But I am using the API with the exchanges to import my trades. The thing is I am importing from 5 different exchanges. The problem is, cointracking does not have a column labeling action which would describe wether it is a buy or a sell. The way it is right now where it has a buy and sell column with the symbol is super confusing to read. I cannot tell what is a buy or sell when it comes to trading pairs like ETH or BTC.

How come he is allowed to post on this subreddit and isn't flared?
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:03:23
I do not understand the purpose of your post? This subreddit is not a platform for emotional venting. I do not understand why moderators do not flair posts from people with accounts less than at least 1 month.

Why did you sell? You thought it was going to hit zero? What price did you buy in at?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:47
Good, Credit Cards are unsecured loans. Its too risky for banks. Use your cash to buy

Don't deal with centralized exchanges. Just use:
Also, no KYC requirements.
