True. The reality is you could lose by investing in bitcoin. Anything is possible.  But for the past 12 years, bitcoin has been up. Many people have made millions while others listened to the naysayers and continue to do so. That's all I'm saying.

I appreciate his optimism and help in this.  He gave a clear plan of action that, if I choose to, I can follow.  I know people who are "doing well" in the whole market and have been for years.  With so much speculation our there its refreshing to see a person willing to commit to a position...

No problem.  I love coinbase and bit pay combo!  Have never had an issue after I figured out how to go directly to the bit pay wallet.  Welcome to CryptoWorld! Enjoy the ride...
