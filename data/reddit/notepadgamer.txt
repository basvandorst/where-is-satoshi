Cant agree more. Ive heard the argument that ASIC's cause centralization because large farms can have multiple. I guess thoes people have forgotten about the GPU shortage, and that large GPU farms still exist.
At the end of the day if someone went up to me and said if I wanted to spend $$ on an almost plug and play machine, or the same ammount on multiple different parts, which dont guarantee best value for money depending on what you buy. Id definitely pick the former.


awesome indeed..

TBH I agree with everything you have said.
But why would developers go out of their way to make it asic resistant. I just dont understand the logic behind it just to spite Asic users

...I dont understand what your getting at.
Take the new Bitmain z9/z9 mini for example. It only mines Equihash, which is a handfull of coins,  yet some of thoes have already forked away from the algorithm and now cant be mined.   It appears to me that this only hurts the coins who fork away by lowering their blockrate and hurting the miners who purchased the device - to only appease the GPU miners.   
Hell you tell a gpu miner that there is a machine that for $850 that does the work of 15+ gtx 1080 Ti's, Is smaller, and wastes less electricity.  Im sure hes going to go for that instead of more GPU's
