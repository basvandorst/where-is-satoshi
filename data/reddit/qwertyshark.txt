~~That's so wrong. I probably use at least 1.3KW all the time between computers and all home appliances.
1.3 KW * 24 * 30 = 936KW/Month, where I am the KW is at 0.13€ so about 121€ (My actual bill is about 150/mo).~~
~~you would have to pay almost TWO dollars per KW(ridiculous) to get to $1800 month~~
Missed that OP was asking for 20 miners that consumed 1300W EACH
math check's out.

Oh my! 26KWh?! That's insane. No way he can put that on his home with his standard electrical installation. 
I don't know in OP's country but in my country the maximum KWh you can contract for home use is 9.2KW. If you want more you have to pay for the installation of new wiring from the street to your home with the correct gauge and new electric meter+New breaker etc etc..
A friend of mine upgraded his installation(not home) from 10KWh to 40Kwh and the electric company charged him about 10.000€ and that's for 20 meters of cable or so.

Where did you bought it? $32 seems like a big deal for me, even if you dont ever profit from it
I WANT ONE

It wasn't just a 'fake image file', it was a persistent XSS, and a clever one. WAY more complex to detect for the average user.

Well to be fair it would break the credit cards security too, and SSL certificates used to make a secure connections[HTTPS], only those two come to my mind right now. So it would impact every bank and every currency.  
There are two parts in the security of Bitcoin which could be affected by quantum computers.
One is the security of the elliptic curve cryptography system used when signing transactions. A quantum computer could deduce the private key (and take the funds) if it knows the public key. The private key can be computed solving the discrete logarithm problem, which is efficient in a quantum computer. It would just need a variation of Shor's factoring algorithm
[Here is an interesting paper about quantum attacks on elliptic curve cryptography.](
The second thing is the hash. Grover's algorithm could be used, with some problems, but it is not necessarily the best you can do. There are bounds you can apply directly to collision finding (finding two sequences which hash to the same value). Collision finding (necessary to replace blocks) is not efficient in quantum computers.
it would be easier to pull a 51% attack amassing a lot of computer power than building a scalable quantum computer, at least in the short/medium term.
