We are at a $15 minimum wage now for major cities in the US.
Increasing money supply helps feed the people closest to the spigot. How anyone cant see this is beyond me.
There’s a reason why our schools are fucked and the Kardashian’s are one of the top shows in this country and it’s to keep the general population oblivious.
Pretty fucking sad.

Although there’s a “finite” supply of gold, oil and other precious metals...there is also a good amount left to be mined and drilled / refined. Mining cartels control the supply / prices.
Bitcoin, there is a finite supply. Anyone who spends 5 minutes as a bitcoin noob will immediately hear about the 21m. Although we scheduled supply, we also have the block reward halving.

Hindsight. Again, you’re speaking from current perspective 
So finney and szabo penned projects that were against the usd as well and they suddenly go against that precedence with bitcoin and use a pen name?
I don’t buy it, it’s wishful thinking.
Easier to assume that the guys real name is satoshi nakamoto, a former govt employee, who freaked out after bitcoin blew up and denounced having anything to do with it

I didn’t think it was Dorian either but then saw his reddit ama. He’s very well read, studied various languages, and his replies didn’t match up with that fumbling persona.
Keep in mind that when bitcoin started, no one had any clue how it would turn out.
No one.
So there could have been a chance that he penned it with his real name, after all the other cypherpunks had.
Why wouldn’t szabo use his real name? Or Finney?
I don’t think it’s either of them because they’ve already shown that they have no issues putting credit to their work.
Couldn’t we also entertain satoshi did the same?
After the whole thing blew up and became global, he could have freaked out and just flat out denied it.

If hyperinflation happened, it would be easier to pay of debt incurred before inflation
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:57:30
One HUGE problem it solves is putting a “cap” on inflation of value. This is larger than anyone could possibly imagine because nothing has ever existed that could put a hard cap on global value.
Bitcoin has its problems. Hodling is definitely going to slow adoption. The learning curve in handling bitcoin is high. The infrastructure is not currently there BUT it is being developed and once all of the pieces are in place. The purchasing power will take off.
Another comment is that bitcoin isn’t going to be the “people’s currency” many of us, myself included, Hope it will be.
Bitcoin will become the ultimate tool in consolidating wealth and power because we are removing enslavement of the 99% with inflationary policy.
This will have dramatic effects on the further increasing the divide in wealth 
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:16:17
Chiming in, you totally misread the article and are not understanding Peter Todd’s quote.
Visa and MasterCard are far superior to bitcoin in what they do, which is providing a safe settlement layer on fiat. They offer a lot of consumer protection.
Bitcoin protects wealth vs inflation. It’s a far more superior form of internet money than anything in existence but the infrastructure to protect people sufficiently does not currently exist.
It will but we are not there yet.
I don’t think a guy like peter Todd is going to devote the hours he does on being a bitcoin dev if he thought it was inferior.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:02:44
Largest driver behind mining for precious metals is for consumer applications (jewelry, computer circuitry etc).
There is an actual driver behind the price of gold. The speculative component is overblown, imo.
Bitcoins biggest driver is to provide a solid foundation for accounting for value. We don’t have the infrastructure in place to take advantage of this yet but for some strange reason, these private companies are investing billions to figure it out.

Problem with gold is that it’s not currency and isn’t really money now. Fiat has replaced gold for both uses.
Gold has more value for its consumption through electronic parts and jewelry. This isn’t to say it doesn’t have “store of value” but most of this is due to speculation and the “intrinsic” value narrative is spin.
Bitcoin is different as money because it has a hard cap. This isn’t a secret. You can also “see” how much is in existence. You can’t do this with gold or anything else really.
We can’t even account for all of the fiat, money, value in existence.
Bitcoin is special.
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:18:58
I’m all for the future of bitcoin but banks will exist, they’ll adapt.
Coinbase is a bank and it’ll grow as the space grows and they figure it out.
Banks will exist because the average person is fucking stupid. 
Also the idea of having your lifetimes wealth hacked or lost forever is not appealing to the average person. They will gladly give up financial sovereignty for the right to chargeback and have a custodian.

I’m willing to bet my left but that no banks are abiding by this pie in the sky fractional reserve bs.
We have seen an unprecedented level of inflation during the past 10 years. Basic Econ 101 says we should have drastically increased interest rates to bankrupt the “bad blood” and refresh the system.
About 20 years ago, minimum wage was a bit below $5.
Now we are looking at a $15 in the US.
Obviously there’s a lag in the system and the increase in minimum wage is happening AFTER years of the fat cats getting their share of cheap capital.

If you’re looking at a 4 year window and you’re optimistic about this. Why would it concern you whether you buy now or at 3500? 2500? Or 1500?

So you’re telling me you have $10 million in bitcoin and are fucking dumb enough to consider throwing it into this?
I don’t believe you because your stupidity would have weeded you out earlier. 
Also, if you were self made, you wouldn’t need to go on reddit to self brag because you’d be a bit more certain in what you are doing.

You dumb shit, they’re offering a 6% return for holding your bitcoin. This is nearly triple what anyone else is offering.
There’s nothing to research Einstein, it is a fucking scam.

Bitcoin can and will go up 100x easily. I think all of the circle jerks of idiots saying itll hit $100,000 is a huge disservice because it will easily surpass that and beyond, as far as purchasing power goes.
There are a lot of global actors involved who need this to eventually overtake everything as a global ledger for assets.

You either get it or you dont.
The biggest problem bitcoin solves is that in this internet based global economy of ours, it puts a hard tangible verifiable cap on value.
Youre either underestimating or dont fully understand how big of an issue this really is.
