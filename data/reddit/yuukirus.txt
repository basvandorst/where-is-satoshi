Are all of those services for buying bitcoins, in your opinion, safe?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:21:54
I've been looking into altcoins, but not that one just yet. I've been mining Etherium on the side as a sort of investment with my GPU since it's been pretty profitable.
Looking at Litecoin, it looks like their value is on the up and up lately as well and it might be a safe/cheap investment to make.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:16:15
I noticed it has been jumping like crazy lately. Might spend a bit on litecoin very soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:47:18
Unfortunately, after looking into those sites, I found that they're not available for my country. They did lead me to good alternatives though in the end thanks to google, so I thank you for the suggestions.

Tempted to panic buy.

That sounds pretty much like what I intend to do. I would probably also spend my 100 dollars when BTC has value dips, like when it dropped to 14k yesterday, I would have probably thrown money at it.
I'll assume it's a good idea, given that it's an investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:15:57
That's my plan, but the main thing is.. Is it worth spending 100 dollars a month in bitcoins, since it's such a tiny amount of money and where should I go to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:47:49
I will need to look into this. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:39:44
Yeah, I'd probably only be doing Bitcoins as someone that's just jumping into all of this. I'm just pretty excited to try mining and saving up those coins. 
I am curious since you seem to be quite learned on the subject. Do you think mining with a dedicated antminer is a good idea? I spent all day looking at calculations for profit and how the profit would drop over time with difficulty, but no matter how much I looked, I found it was profitable for me with an electricity cost of 0.09usd per kwh. I don't intend on selling the bitcoins, just storing them for years to come. Do you think this is ill advised? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:32:34
Thank you so much for all of this information. Is there any specific product you'd recommend out of those you mentioned?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:03:10
I think it may be worth it though. If I invested 3.5 grand into bit coins, i'd probably not touch it for a long time there after and I'd have about 0.45 of a bitcoin.
If I bought an antminer, at my electric cost, it should actually be a littler quicker to profit (6 months) and after one year, I'd actually have 0.9 of a bitcoin at it's hashrate and it can keep running forever, so I won't need to spend money on bitcoins, instead I'm "buying" bitcoins at a cheaper pricer, but slower pace.
it seems smart long term.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:59:22
7-8 months.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:20:53
I was planning on mining to keep the coins. I don't plan on selling them any time soon. My plan, which I want questioned by enthusiasts on this subreddit, is to buy in with an antminer s9 and mine passively for as long as the thing works. 
I have no intention on selling the bitcoins, I plan to eat the electric costs, at least for a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:31:29
Do you happen to know how reliable and quiet it is?
Not looked into AvalonMiner's in the past, but on paper this machine is better than the antminer r4 easily.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:52:02
I'm planning on getting the antminer r4, since it's very very quiet compared to the s9. I saw it also has great efficiency and the lower miners I saw in price just.. seemed wasteful to me. They all seem to use around 1000-1300 watts, even if their hash rates are really low, so I found the r4 to be a good compromise. I do have a large room I can put it in that doesn't get too hot. I saw that it should pay for itself within 7 months, including shipping so it seems like a good idea for me. The electric cost won't kill me either, so I'd love to make the investment.

I looked it up and came across a website called bitaddress for generating an address plus private key to store via a paper wallet.
Do you think this website is safe or would you recommend alternatives? Thank you for the information.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:25:32
That stat is amazing. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:27:07
How would you hook up your bitcoins being sent to this though? From what I understand, you gain a sort of address to send mined coins to when you sign up with a wallet, but how would you gain that if you had one of these?
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:16:58
Thank you so much for that in depth response. You have helped me keep my future investment much, much safer. Booting off of a usb with the github copy of bitaddress is actually genius.
It does make me kind of question though. Isn't it theoretically possible, (but beyond unlikely I imagine) to generate the same address as someone else? I imagine this is near impossible to do anyway.

Going to rephrase with a bit more information. 
It would cost be 3500 dollars to get into bitcoins and it's estimated (I used a lot of different sites for calculating this) that I should mine between 0.8 at worst and 0.98 at best bitcoins in a single year.
So, my earnings would be in a single year, between about 6000-8000 us dollars.
The earnings in a single year should be almost equal to double what I invested. The mining efficiency, depending on which site you ask, seems to be that 1/3 of my BTC value is electric costs. So for every 6000 I make, I lost 2000 dollars. 
One year one is over is when I'm more interested in. I'd be making at least an estimated 6000 dollars and losing 2000, all the while having bitcoin value (and difficulty to mine, admittedly) rise while I hold onto these coins.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:56:09
That's not really helpful feedback as it doesn't respond to anything in my post and has zero information to it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:52:48
I spent my entire day today running the numbers. If I account for my electricity costs and calculate for difficult increasing by 7% per month, I should still be profiting for about a year (Just barely on the 12th month) this is of course if BTC prices don't raise, so I think I'm good to just set up a miner and leave it alone mostly. Unless you think a 7% difficulty increase per month isn't enough lately.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:57:35
Why though, when it seems that calculating the machines efficiency, it would be around 300% profit in bitcoins that I can hold onto..? It seems to just be a cheaper method of "buying" bitcoins to keep.
