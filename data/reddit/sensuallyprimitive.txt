Bitcoin was the first crypto, not the best crypto.  Ethereum costs pennies (less than one cent if you are willing to wait longer) and most transactions take seconds.

Gdax has no fee and takes less than 48 hours to put fiat in the bank, if that is even wanted.  About 5 minutes for 0% conversion to USD, though.  Also, no worry of forced liquidation.  How do you account for that risk?  None of what you just plotted out makes a 10% margin at 5x sound logical.  You are just gambling.

It'll just make people move to systems that are not front-loaded by historically accepted wealth.  I'm guessing that it hasn't been made yet.  The people that think btc will continue to this path where it's just "the crypto" because "everyone just agrees" (aka, really just the people who own it now and earlier), and they will all be millionaires for investing 5k.  It's just absurd, really.  People aren't that dumb and I trust that they'll continue to make better solutions.  Btc shows the path and has the potential to continue down it, but I don't think that it has clinched that position permanently.

If you can’t understand the ~~difference~~ similarities between stock and crypto, you’re not educated enough to be putting real money into this.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:29:51
I am fully aware of the difference between the currencies.  However, if one currency can be artificially produced and traded for the other currency, they both technically become artificially produced currencies.  Corruption of one corrupts all.  The Federal Reserve could easily buy out all markets of bitcoin and push the price to levels that would tempt a large amount of holders to cash out.  It would be very fast and covert, could be done from a million international wallets over the course of minutes/days/months, and would look exactly like a moon shot for bitcoin.
Re-read the comments and you'll see that we're talking about a hypothetical situation, and not at all arguing about the differences between fiat and crypto.  


I'll just be the bigger person and ignore this part.  Grow up and don't tell people where they "should be posting."  You are an asshole.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:57:30
If fiat is bullshit and can be traded for bitcoin... bitcoin is inherently bullshit as well.   A trillion bullshit dollars can buy all the bullshit bitcoin, as is.  Our economy is a lie! Yay!
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:18:03
I'm not saying USD is or ever will be bullshit, and I think that's irrelevant to my comment.  I'm just explaining the logic of OP.  Houses and healthcare and food have tangible value.  Bitcoin does not.  If all confidence is lost in USD, and a majority of bitcoin are owned by the previous large holders of USD wealth... then the whole system is fubar.  The government could have been buying up bitcoin and other currencies all along with their funny money, before anyone was fully aware of the scam.

All three should be relatively worthless on the scale we have today.  None back wealth.  They are relics of the past stores of value.  There's not enough physical wealth on the planet to equal the fiat.  Thank fractional reserve banking, I guess.  Crime will happen regardless of what happens, but financial crime would most certainly be changed drastically if we went to a blockchain-based system.

They will suffer from their own lack of savings for living to the max of their means.  This is not the employer's fault.  When I was poor (&lt;20k/yr supporting two adults, no outside assistance), I cut corners to save.  Why reward those who refuse to?  If your job is no longer financially viable against a robot, you are just wasting everyone's time so you can have money.    
Time to find a job that actually benefits society, (rather than draining from it) because someone might "suffer" if they have to get a job they are actually needed at.  News flash, everyone suffers.
