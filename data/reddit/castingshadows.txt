The global gold market, mining and demand are so complex and complicated - any time an expert tries to explain why gold is good or bad or will rise or fall i have to laugh.... I hold about 5 - 10 % of my assets in physical gold, a number i heard over and over again by financial advisers and the number makes sense to me. I buy gold basically every year and the prize is of no concern to this decision. At the moment I am not planning on selling my gold in the next 20 to 30 years - so enough time to hold out through bad gold-times. If gold would rise unexpected there is a chance i would sell, if it falls I keep on buying. But gold is money officially where i live, and it has been since basically forever and the chances that gold will still be valuable in a 1000 years are better than the case that it will be worthless...
But you are right: Gold is not very comfortable to handle. I don't store my gold at home because I believe its not really safe. But on the other hand as a gold buyer I am a 100 % anonymous. I take my money go into a gold-shop and buy an ounce - nobody knows that I bought it. That is something I can't say about me buying Bitcoins. 
I really wish for Bitcoins to succeed as a payment but at the moment I am not sure that it will happen. The reason is the strong volatility. There is a reason why companies like Dell don't really handle the payments with Bitcoin themselves but have a middle-men who pays out dollars to them. I don't really understand how little business handle Bitcoin-Payments. Do they keep the Bitcoins? Are they selling them straight away? What if they fall? How do they pay their suppliers? With Bitcoins or with FIAT?
We all know the rule that you shouldn't invest in something you don't understand and when it comes to Bitcoins I still have a lot of more questions than answers. I am using and supporting Bitcoins, but I am very careful...
