Why would anyone put a buy order on here rather than just buy directly from gox? They still allow deposits don't they?
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:31:00
Hmm, I swear I saw a guy saying he was depositing to Gox from the US the other day. I'd test it but I'd rather not lose more money to Gox that need-be.

I understand the concept but I would have thought that if you were willing to trade your bitcoins for goxcoins, you could spend some of your old-world currency on them instead of paying twice as much as you needed to. I guess you're paying for the extra speed but still...

If you're highlighting the abstract you're doing something wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:14:08
Please don't, that's the fastest way to lose money. The issue is that the trend line you draw today will be different to the one you draw next year so you can't tell if we are under or over the trend.

The entire point of statistics is learning to extrapolate and calculate the estimation errors you would get. In the XKCD there is only 2 data points so the estimation for 48 days in the future is going to have a very wide confidence interval. In other words, you can extrapolate but you need to remember the affect on your risk. (But yeah the chart is trash haha)

And who would mine this magical coin with 0 reward?
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:39:02
For what it's worth I agree, but do you think he has control of the coins and/or will ever spend them?
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:55:16
Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't every new block have the public key of the miner? Is it just that there are so many centralised coins that it would be a primary target?
Thanks for your input, however when evaluating the value of the network, the per-coin price will depend on the number of coins. If you were to value the network at $100b usd then you would be buying coins now for $5600 if there was a total supply of 20 million but you would be selling if there was a total supply of 21 million (ignoring time value of money, you get the idea). Just like knowing the total number of USD in circulation would help you make better financial decisions, knowing the supply of BTC is important to all participants.
edit: Also why do you see those coins being stolen as a threat? Do we trust Satoshi more than thieves who steal them? They are the same coins, the owner is irrelevant to their impact on the economy. This is exactly what I'm trying to get to the bottom of, it seems logical to trust Satoshi and these hypothetical thieves just as much (that is, not at all).

So you want to eliminate PoW? Lol

Jesus Christ dude, firstly you spend half your time talking about an issue I don't care about in the slightest (what should we do about the coins etc) and clearly said was pointless discussing. Then you tell me to read the whitepaper as if I didn't read it before I invested over 4 years ago and an economic concept that is taught in the first 3 weeks of any intro macro course.
All I am saying is that there is a logical inconsistency in the combination of trusting no individual, assuming that someone knows private keys, and valuing the network with the assumption that the coins won't be spent. I'm not saying that you think all of these three things are true but there are people who at the very least believe the second two. The question was: If you believe those second two statements are true, it follows that you trust Satoshi; Why?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:44:09
This is fundamentally untrue, the reason the network works is because it is backed by a lot of hashing power. We pay the miners because they provide the security of the network. If the only people mining are a couple million pc gpus it would be relatively cheap to perform a majority attack. Finding the block hash is intentionally very computationally difficult, it's the fundamental idea of why btc works 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:04:12
The difference being that Visa/your bank can reverse a transaction if it is fraudulent. During that 3-5 days you can dispute the transaction and block it, even after that it can be reversed. It's an assurance policy that causes the delay, not a technical limitation. Once you spend your bitcoin and walk out of the store, there is no way to get you to pay again if the payment is orphaned etc.

I'm not proposing a solution, I just want to get a gauge of what people think. Markets are a weighted average of people's opinions, if 100% if people think they are still in circulation then the market will act as if there are 21m coins but if 0% think that it will act as if there are only 20m. I think it is an interesting question because it is a somewhat contradictory combination of thinking he is gone and thinking he deserves the coins. In reality only one of those possibilities can be realised.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:02:31
Thanks dude, appreciate it. I'll keep looking into some of these assumptions then, I think I'm getting close to a theory that lets you back out the market expected quantity from market cap and some other factors. I'm really keen to see if the number ends up being less than or equal to 'real' supply.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:36:12


Interesting, cheers.
By far the most interesting and valuable thing about blockchain as a technology is not relying on trust. I personally am 100% into this for the "don't trust anyone, only trust the network" idea. For all we know Satoshi is some terrible and immoral person somewhere but the brilliant thing is that it doesn't matter. There is no proof that btc wasn't state-sponsored to begin with for example (although I think that's an unlikely theory).
It's not that I don't see the difference between Satoshi and a thief but people can be manipulated, fooled or mistaken. Once you let one element of trust come into the network, it is a very slippery slope. Perhaps you see the technology for its other benefits but for those of us who put high value in the elimination of trust, it is important.
Further, it's not the 'crash' that I'm necessarily concerned with. I mean selling all 1m should only theoretically decrease the price by 7% but the logical inconstancy is concerning.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:02:36
I'll have to look into it more because I don't have a great argument against this. I'll have to remind myself of the details because I'm pretty confident there is a good reason that wouldn't work 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:56:21
Great to hear, I'll be sure you use you guys as my example when I'm explaining why someone should accept it :P
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:39:30
Just for a little context, blue line is the ln(price) and green is the deviation from the price-per-transaction trend (x axis is time). It's late so I might add some more details later but there is a strong correlation of price and transaction quantity that has lead large price changes in the past.
Just an interesting data set, posting to hold myself accountable to the prediction.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:25:08
Someone has to process the transactions. They will be 'mining' the hashes just like always but won't get the block rewards in like 100 years
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:11:10
While I don't see the overlap between your customers and people with bitcoin, I really appreciate the effort to make bitcoin ubiquitous. With all the politics around the dev team people here sometimes lose sight of the true (at least in my opinion) goal of a true digital currency.
Hopefully you guys will be the step that's needed to get Coles and Woolies to get on board and Australia can really start getting ahead in the world for the first time since the hills hoist. Props to whoever pushed for accepting bitcoin, I'm not a customer but if you could pass on a message that we think it is important to any higher-up doubters please do. The worst possible outcome would be to see the program get cancelled in a couple quarters.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:52:51
Similar idea, different method. I think some version of this will be a very important tool in valuing crypto in the future.

All I'm interested in is if people think he still controls the coins, as soon as I "slyly" justify theft you can call me out, but that's not what I'm talking about. I don't mean trust in the sense that he is a danger to the network or transactions. As quantity theory states (which you apparently know about so I can use that example), the price per coin is inversely related to the number of coins, ceteris paribus. What does matter is market expectations of the use of those coins. In fact, every coin that is 'lost' by having its private key forgotten would in theory increase the value of each other coin. That's why it's illegal to burn fiat currency because the central bank wants to control the money supply.
Here's an alternative, if I were to go and buy up 1m coins myself, the value would increase short term but in the long run there would be no effect on price. However if I then spent them to a wallet that nobody owned, you would expect that the price would adjust upward to maintain the same total network price of avaliable coins. The market's belief about my control of those coins will drive the price. 
Bitcoin is trustless, in the sense that you don't have to rely on any third party. But the market is in some sense the total opposite, it is a weighted average of every investor's beliefs about bitcoin/usd/whatever. The great thing about the market, just like proof of work, is that the whole thing is more true than any individual opinion, because it is the average. You can trust the market price more than an individual just like you can trust the network but no individual miner.
If you hold bitcoin but are not looking at what you think the total value of the network is, you are just gambling. Once you have an estimate of total network value, you need to determine the number of coins in circulation to get a price per coin. This is true for any currency valuation and is done by heaps of people every day.

They are lost if Satoshi has intentionally given up the private keys
In/Deflation is relative to market expectations, if the market expects quantity x coins at price t each, then x and t are inversely related
