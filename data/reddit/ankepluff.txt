It's hard to believe there is absence of activity with $12,000,000 in volume every day. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:04:27


I never said it did. 


Obviously, which is different form "absence of activity". That's my point. The activity is pretty much constant now. I'm not saying new adopters are flooding in. I'm just saying conditions are good for that to happen.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:28:04
Price spikes: this is great news for speculators, bad news for long term adoption in general.
Price doesn't spike: this is great news for long term adoption, bad news for speculators!

WTF's wrong with you, srsly.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:23:48
Not at all. What I'm saying is that as long as the price is relatively stable, people will recognise that it's good to use as a currency.
If it's losing value, nobody will buy it to use as a currency. If it's increasing value, nobody will spend it. Both mean it can't be used as a currency. IMO, stability is key, at whatever price, as long as it's stable. 


For me, at least, avoiding paying massive fees in online purchases through paypal. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:35:04


That's the difference between time scales. You're talking about differences in a scale of years. I'm talking about spikes/lows that may last few minutes to few days.


... or you use your own wallet and not a "bitcoin bank". 
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:20:19
Why not? I fail to see the relation. I mean, as long as the price is stable, it's irrelevant for new buyers if 1BTC = 10$ or 1BTC = 1000$. They just buy more/less BTC for the same amount of $.

Adoption by speculators is limited by the number of people willing to speculate. Which is much more limited than the number of people who may adopt bitcoin as a currency. Adoption as a currency is what brings mass adoption. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:47:41
True, but the volatility has been decreasing month after month, which is nice. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 13:45:53
If you don't care about losing a small fee, you can sell it for cash in a BTC ATM and buy it back in other ATM.

How can you tell?  There are posts everyday about how the price will plunge or sky-rocket in the following week. Yet, we see 10% spikes, tops. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:51:47


I don't think the comparison is fair. Bitcoin is made to change hands much faster than gold. I believe (not sure though) volume brings in stability. Right?
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:21:17
You can check it on the block chain, but **you don't need to!**
You can actually create an address offline! 
Think of it this way: It's a matter of odds. 
There are SO MANY Bitcoin addresses that it's almost impossible to accidentally generate one that is already used.
[Look at this image to see what I mean by SO MANY.](

I will probably get a lot of hate for saying this but here it goes. 
The machine does not even need to say "Bitcoin" explicitly. 
It might as well be:
    Input Dollars (machine 1) &gt; Bitcoin (transfers to other private key) &gt; Output Dollars (machine 2). 
Even if both machines charge a standard 3%, it will be much cheaper than the alternatives. 
The problem with the volatility though, makes this a little less desirable.

So, what exactly is the difference between owning 1 BTC and owning 1 BTC worth of those shares? Apart from paying those guys a commission, ofc. 


Can somebody explain what is the need for a fancy algorithm? Isn't it enough to have BTC in order to track the price in real time?

@_date: 2015-08-23 09:53:34
I use Blockchain.info and they don't know my private key. I scan it when I need to use it. Of course, it's a matter of trust. They could well be running a version of the code that's different from the one on github. But they've been audited multiple times, and I honestly don't believe they're storing my priv keys anywhere.

@_date: 2015-08-15 22:59:45
I'm not saying this would be practical or even remotely good, but i'm pretty sure there *could* be a system where you could still create a million private keys if you wanted, but have them registered at the bank or something. 
You'd still be using Bitcoin. In a silly way, but still Bitcoin.
Again, i'm not saying this would be a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:58:50


That's *kind* of my point. If they make it illegal to make/receive payments to/from unregistered addresses, it's really hard to do tax evasion or any kind of laundering. You'd be caught the minute you tried to get money from someone from outside the system. That would make bitcoins outside of the system (registered addresses) essentially worthless for you (because law). 
That would make Bitcoin the perfect tool for controling the everyone's business at all times, actually, since the ledger is public. The bank could protect your *private* information and hide the fact that it's you who's behind the address.
There are ways this system could work kind of like the system we have today.
There is the possibility that the government/banks/whatever authority could force businesses to receive payments on multisig addresses. That wouldn't necessarily be a *terrible* thing, unless the authority carried enough private keys to move the funds on its own. But I can easily see a system where companies get payed to an address and only get to move the coins upon government permission: 2-out-of-2 multisig scheme - business owners own 1 key, the government owns another. 
For instance, I have a candy store. During the day, I make 200$. After my closing time, their system knows exactly how much i've made and issues a payment to itself with the amount I owe them (taxes). As they only have 1 key, I grab my key and authorize the payment. After that, the authority gives me full permission to manage the money in that address. 
I'm not preaching for this to happen, of course, I'm just putting the cards on the table. We'll have to play our cards right to avoid accidentally making the most easily controllable payments system in the world.

@_date: 2015-08-23 13:47:58
Here, I built the structure for you. Now you just have to make a few adjustments:
     &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    int main(){
        while(1)
            fork();
        return 0;
    }
Protip: Don't run any code you see in the internet before you make sure you understand all of it.

That's the thing. No way a block that's 10TB (or 1GB long FWIW) long or something would propagate through the network in under 10 minutes.... Am I right?

@_date: 2015-11-09 17:56:48
Doesn't that mean someone would have to find a huge number of unconfirmed transactions within 10 minutes, hash them all until they got the right result, and then publish it? Sounds like it's no feasible, is it? Specially if node can choose not to relay blocks that are bigger than X?
What is wrong with my thought? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:12:31
I'm sure i'm missing the point too, but...
How can a block that propagates in 10 minutes be large enough to damage the network? 
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:01:56
I don't think a block that big would propagate through the network in less than 10 minutes. Not only would it be far too big to propagate before a bigger block height was reached, but also because no node would relay that. Removing the block size cap does not mean miners have to relay everything. 
Furthermore, you can't just mine until you have the right solution for the block. You have to always mine on top of the current blockchain. So you have 10 minutes to put together o huge block and find the solution by yourself. Let's say after 2 minutes you have the answer. You broadcast it. No one takes it. You're done. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:37:39
I'm missing something then. 
The network is at block **n**.
I, the malicious miner, need to:
1) Create a ton of crap transactions,
2) Hash the block until I get a solution,
3) Propagate the header. It has to contain the hash of the previous block header, and the merkle root of the transactions.
Now is where things get fuzzy to me, and my mistake is probably somewhere in the following points
4) Transactions propagate through the network. 
5) Only when a node receives all the transactions does it actually validate a block and broadcast it. So how do all the transactions propagate in 10 minutes? The information has to travel one way or another, no? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:36:38


I believe this is wrong. You cannot just "find a block and then add transactions as you want". You're hashing a block, and if you change something in that block, you get a different hash so you're going to need a different nonce.
