Thanks for the clarification guys!

They claim they charge [fees to the seller only](
Are there further hidden fees to the buyer masked by a less-than-favourable exchange rate?
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:33:50
That's new to me. I'll take a look.

Am I right in thinking I wouldn't need an IBAN for transferring from Fidor to an exchange/market? (But will do to transfer back in).

Understood. Now to find out whether CC/DC fees in those exchanges is more or less favourable than the adjusted exchange rate from sellers on BL.

Damn, didn't realise the difference was that much. SEPA with my bank was £10, which I would've needed to pay just to get verified on Coinbase, hence the search for alternatives.

Which is a marketplace and not an exchange, right?
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:10:05
No fee SEPA? Wow!!

lol, lifestyle of the rich and famous.

So individual sellers on that site set their own fees which are passed to the buyer? And these are seen when choosing a seller for the specified amount?

Thanks for the tip!

Thanks for the tip. I bought some on the 16th when it went below the magic $2k mark. I'll wait till next week and try a purchase through Coinify.

I gathered there's some shit going down. How smelly is it?
Unless you meant the actual system is undergoing downtime?

They're based in Slovenia, so I suspect the same deposit charges from my UK bank would apply.

Thanks for the tip. It seems coinify charge 3% for CC/DC, compared to 3.99 for coinbase. Might give it a go.
