This was not meant to be a post to bash bitcoin, I am not getting out of bitcoin since I know it's going much higher, Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who hate it because they did not get in. You were stupid to get out.

Take a look at the above link. The graph shows how all bitcoin is distributed throughout the different currencies. about 10 day ago, the Japanese had 49%, look at today. It's not FUD, and let me state that I am big backer of btc.

O.K. so it's not just me. My app is hardly updating, a lot of coins won't even update. Somehow, someway, the wrong symbol was with the wrong icon. For example bitcoin cash icon was showing the leters rcn. WTF??? I missed opportunity because of this Cluster F too!! Can anyone provide an alternative. I spent so much time adding the coins I need in there, now this app is junk!

Yes, you are 100% right. However, the most ethical exchanges will ask for this information up front from you without freezing your assetts. I myself have not had any problems with bittrex, binance, bitfinex, poloniex, however, I have done kyc with all of them. I can't speak about xapo, never had an account there.

The problem is, increasingly, the fucking Europeans are crying louder and louder for regulations. I for one. provide my documents to all of them, and there is a paper trail for everything I do, I have complied with all that has been asked of me by all exchanges from the beginning, and I have not had a problem. Fuck you and your regulations Christine Lagarde, you fucking cunt!!
