The Wink ETF always seemed like an impossible dream, but then again, so did their exchange. 
Looks like there's hope after all

Second this. A lot of these blockchain proponents take for granted that running one is pretty hard. Look at some of these alt coins that were easily attacked. 
Which begs the question, how illegal would "attacking" a US Bank coin be? Granted basically anything can be chalked up under the wiretap act, but "attacking" BTC certainly isn't illegal.
