Slow, down son. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:04:03
I second this.

Right, so in the future it will look like the 1900's.

As if anyone that hasn't "hit puberty" yet can even afford to own BTC anymore. What a terrible corny response, especially for a "reporter"
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:47:15
Get off that fucking high horse already.
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:45:18
What a jackass thing to say
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:14:54
Guys you can make fun of this all you want, but i've been day trading it for a few weeks and making huge profits. Remember where bitcoin started, and how easily it was mocked by the masses. Trust me you want to get involved in this now.

Article pissed me off more than anything when the guy blatantly put a picture of the guys house for the entire world to see. This guys clearly a recluse, leave him the fuck alone.

Stuff like this scares the shit out of me.

I just hope this isn't some ploy to get us to stay in and then they fucking do it anyways

I'm sort of curious what this will do to their stock prices.

Damn it! I did contact support, at least i posted a public question on their board and also wrote them on twitter. Thanks i'll x-post on @_date: 2013-12-19 03:49:00
I like your enthusiasm! Let's get this money.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:07:59
I'm really excited.  
Here's why. 
I didn't get into bitcoin when i wanted to at the $140 level and had a huge FOMO experience. Now i see all these pussies getting out and dropping the price steadily. So i'm sitting here waiting for it to hit my marks and then scooping up a few.  
edit: also for you veterans out there, what's a good figure to look at getting in?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:20:15
No clue why you're being downvoted, this is all accurate information.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:32:00
I used to swing trade so i can hopefully handle these swings. I am hoping for it to go lower tonight so i can put more in. I'm starting with a small investment of $1500
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:18:14
You bought them today?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:19:26
Thanks i'm looking to buy 2 full ones if they drop below 500. I really just wanted to get my feet wet. Been watching this thing all day long
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:39:19
Do you have a target price i should look at to acquire one or 2 full ones? I'm thinking the 3-400 level but is that unrealistically low?
