It could be the liquidity piece you mentioned.  If quadriga has continuous trading and coinsquare doesnt trade or update their price feed as often you could see the spread.  hmmmm...  Maybe I need to test it out and see what the average spread is over time between exchanges and factor in fees and slippage.  Most of the exchanges require a few confirmations before you can trade so there's a risk there also that the spread would close and there wouldnt be any profit to be made.

I do  too. I'm not showing my wallet balance but talking stocks or crypto with my boss isn't bad. He bought some crypto too. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:21:32
Forgive me if I'm wrong but isn't the nature of LN such that a node cannot be cracked allowing the theft of BTC from a channel they have open. Since the channel is crypto secure and multi sig a hacker can't really do anything except possible a DDos. The user that opened the original channel can always close it and get the correct amount of BTC from their last channel balance with the node. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:50:12
My understanding is that because it is multi sig the hacker wouldn't be able to really do anything unless the other person who opens the channel also signs any change to the channel. 
I'm sure there are some people on here who have better understanding than I do.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:28:01
There has to be some incentive to owning and operating a BTM. 5% seems pretty reasonable in this case. It's not a charity. It's a business. The fees for transactions are unrelated. I'm talking about the exchange spread they charge. Sure, transactions should be cheaper on the network but that's certainly not the responsibility of BTM operators.

Yes. If you want it all back in CAD in the end then a Canadian exchange may be a better option. Other things to consider would be the difference in spread on the exchanges in Canada vs USA. I think quadriga has a lower price than Gemini after exchange adjustment so you might make more by selling on Gemini and converting to CAD in your Canadian bank or a currency exchange. 
Last considerations would be trade pricing and order options. Gemini has cheaper per trade fees than Quadriga.

Letting the banks fail would have been a much better idea. Then use the $16T to support the lower and middle class through the depression that would have followed. Instead the bailout crushed the savers and lower and middle class anyways and enriched those who profited most from the creation of the credit bubble in the first place.

I agree, but that system is enshrined in the laws of the land and allows people to transfer ownership with the consent of the land titles office but potentially without the consent of the true owner.  Government can seize the land, courts can order the transfer of land.  The court system can also enforce real estate contracts through specific performance.  With bitcoin, no court, supreme court, or other authority can "force" a transfer of the BTC.  It's like a whole new level of ownership in that sense and raises a number of interesting legal ideas.

All those credit type systems are pegged against USD typically which further reduces their value. Bitcoin should still have some excellent value as it is not pegged. While all the world devalues their dollars you can seek refuge with bitcoin. Sure it is volatile but I think in the long run it has great prospects.

Your bank is going to charge you NSF fees and other fees. Plus the debiting party may redebit your account again and again until the funds clear. Each one of these will charge you more NSF fees until they either stop trying or the transfer completes. FYI you're going to probably lose more in fees than you will save in price. Plus you're a total fucktard. Yes. Fucktard.

Exactly.  Eurozone has now set a precedent for confiscating deposited money.  Money will move from ALL euro banks INTO German banks as they are perceived to have the least risk of needing a bailout.

"There are no mines at $150/oz."
Thank you, my point exactly.  
Value and Costs are not independent of each other, they both have an effect on each other.  I'm fully aware of the dynamics of markets and pricing.  And yes, I have a degree in business.  
You need to take into account the disconnect between short run and long run times frames.  In the short run, you can make profit in a mis-priced market due to the difference between current price and cost.  In the long run, market competition erodes profits driving price toward marginal cost (unless the market is a monopoly). Perhaps YOU should take some courses.
Unless you BUILT your house, your housing analogy is not valid.  The price of real estate includes 2 values, land and improvements.  Land price is very subjective and makes up the vast majority of the profit or loss you can get from buying/selling a house.   The inherent value to a home is the future value of the potential cashflows generated by the asset (i.e. market rents).

As I said before, name me a mine, give a reference for your stats.  Given the ore grades on the vast majority of mines, I can't come up with a single mine which would be able to cover its costs at $150/oz.  
Normal commodity markets prices trend toward the marginal cost of production.  Currently the average cost/oz of getting it out of the ground is between $900-1100/oz.  
Yes it's possible to have a price below $900/oz but that would be dependent on the other metals you're also mining from the same ground, I.e. Ag, Cu.  There are some mines which primarily mine other base metals and Au is just a biproduct of their mining (i.e. icing on the cake).  But I would not consider those to be gold mines for the purpose of this discussion. Not to mention, if gold went from $1385/oz to $150/oz most of the other base metals would probably be much lower in value and the mines discussed above wouldnt likely operate.

If the US is the only country that takes that type of action, I dont think it would matter.  Also, i doubt US corporations would be happy the US made it illegal if they were missing out on the rest of global adoption.
Not to mention, BTC used for illegal purposes is already a booming business in the USA and that would probably continue regardless of if the US made BTC illegal or not, places like SR are already operating in illegal businesses so they wouldn't care one way or another.
And lastly, if BTC were to become illegal, another ALT coin could take BTC's place in the USA and there could still be an international ALT coin to BTC exchange which could still allow BTC to live happily without the US' blessing.
