Look for the original Bitcoin-qt Client. Once/if you find that you have a wallet, backup the wallet.dat file(Found in your appdata) straight away to ensure that you do not lose it.
Also, do not trust anyone offering to help you, they may be attempting to steal your coins.

If AntPool and co start signalling, I will admit that I am sold on this. A HF could be used along with the unnecessary 2mb to fix bugs etc. and I would support this compromise despite not agreeing with the HF

If Antpool, Viabtc etc. start signalling Segwit, I will revert my node back from UASF to Core. However I will not even consider it until this agreement is fulfilled. If by August Segwit is not being active/being activated, I will continue to use BIP148 and use the BIP148 chain.
