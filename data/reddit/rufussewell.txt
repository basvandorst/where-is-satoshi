To me bitcoin looks more like electronic Gold than currency.
-Both are not backed by a government.
-Both only have value because people want it and the rarity of it.
-Both are hedges against things like inflation and economic collapse.

Don't most retailers immediately convert bitcoin back to USD dollars.
Yes most Americans are ok with tax fraud. Have you ever sold a car for $1 to avoid taxes? Ever undervalued an assets to reduce capital gains? Bought something on the internet and not paid sales tax? This is all tax fraud and they are comfortable with it.

Define **have to**. Does overstock report to the IRS what I buy? When I walk into a brick and mortar store and pay with bitcoins do they report my identity to the IRS? Are they going to require a tax form for everything you purchase? because that is what they would have to do.

bitcoin will be over 9000 by december. mock my words.

How about control over your money. An assets that can't be seized by the IRS or by divorce. How about money unaffected by inflation or government collapse that actually encourages people to save rather then spend.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:41:09
If bitcoins truly gain mainstream support it will collapse. Just like the RIAA and the government trying to control pirated music. If enough people just ignore it, it will collapse and a better system will result

Consider it confirmed, I read the anonymous post of a guy who is a former employee who talked to someone.

Not just protected classes, you can't choose who to do business with **period**, UNLESS you have a legitimate business reason for doing so.
I can't choose to not do business with hippies, but I can choose to not allow people who wear bell bottoms into my business because they will get caught in machinery.
That being said I think coinbase has a legitimate business reason, they are trying be extra careful so they do not draw the attention of law enforcement.

Unless they are trying to convert the funding money into bitcoins so at some point they can just 'lose' them and walk away with the investors money.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:35:49
Exactly most people don't care about most of the benefits of bitcoin, facebook will be free and tied to the dollars so no wild fluctuations. Half the world already has facebook so it makes it easy to send money.
This is a huge threat to bitcoin.

It seemed extreme to have a computer dedicated to being an offline wallet.

An expensive skill that at least in the software engineering field is fairly useless. Most schools that are not MIT or Carnegie Melon are teaching content 5+ years old.

Everybody probably should sell before it drops much lower.

I will not make the same mistake as I did with Facebook. Bought at $25 and put half my savings thinking it would always be around and would rebound. Sold after six months and the price was at $19.
If I had trusted my instincts and held the share price is now $60. I would have more than doubled my money.

They can't or they risk being shutdown. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:01:27
I think my point was clear. Higher education specifically degrees in software engineering are useless (and expensive) in regard to actual skill. They are teaching technology that is out dated and the only purpose they serve is to open doors to organizations that hire based on them. 


Never said nor meant to imply they did.

We will see the collapse of USD as a reserve currency in the next 5 years so in that respect it will grow in relation to the USD.

BTC transfers the risk of fraud from the seller to the buyer.

The person who received the stolen goods is the thief and isn't the Paypal owner or the seller. Unless they catch the thief he will never get his tangible item back.

Are you saying paypal should pay the $400?
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:27:02
I use bitcoin for Overstock but I would never use bitcoin for an ebay purchase. I like the protection paypal / credit cards give me against being screwed. 
What it comes down to is someone has to eat the fraud and in the non-bitcoin world everybody has agreed it is the seller. What tangible benefit do I the buyer get by paying with bitcoin?

At a certain point you cross a line where your greed and stupidity make it your fault. If you send money to a prince in Nigeria you share as much responsibility as the person who took it.

Just ban downloads from California and put a warning that people from the state of California are not permitted use bitcoins client. Bam. You took reasonable action as a response to the letter.
When asked why people are still using it in California you can say we don't control the network and took reasonable and **the only action available to us** to prevent people in California from using it.
