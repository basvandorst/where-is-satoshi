sounds like a lot of work and stress, best to just hodl to 100k and beyond.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:53:24
Same way. You are giving it to somebody (owner of atm) who sold their bitcoin (to you).

You can. It’s just a lot less secure than a paper wallet or cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:40:22

Yep. Capital gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:19
What's the point of posts like this? Just contributing to the echo chamber?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:07:23

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:46
Anyone can. 0.25 usd per trade. No other fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:26:10
