Debit is in and out of your bank account.  I personally wouldn't be giving my debit info out to anybody.  Anybody that has access to your info has access to all the money in your bank account and if stolen you are SOL because banks only insure credit accounts, not debit.

You are naive to think that you have any way of "cleaning up Bitcoin".  The properties of Bitcoin are inherent to ensuring lack of oversight of a governing body.  That's the  thing that bitcoin has going for it.  Do what you say and bitcoin has little to no value because those in charge will find ways to monetize it and jack the fees up for using it.  Couple that with the fact that there is no way of putting somebody in charge of bitcoin or "ejecting the undesirables", that makes the idea silly.
It's like saying you are going to clean up the dollar....the idea is that ignorant.  If you want to create a marketplace, do it, but the thought of stopping the black market......you can't do it.
as for the the anti-Libertarian knocks...keep them to youself, for your own sake, it makes you look bad.  You are going to be hard pressed to find pro-government bitcoin users here...or anywhere.
You need to do a lot more reading and a lot less posting.....

I just don't want the police to profit from stealing them.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:17:20
To prevent the police from wanting to seize them in the first place.  Without any incentive of monetary reward, I doubt the police will spend their time going after them.  I know I'd rather not buy the bitcoin seized from the Silk Road raids because it just further emboldens that sort of action.

Nobody should buy those bitcoin.....it'll just encourage them to perpetuate the "war on drugs". 
Bitcoin clients should flag these transactions with, "these bitcoin have been seized by the police, please do not perpetuate the war on drugs and buy other bitcoin".  Same with other stolen bitcoin.  There should be some way to flag reported stolen bitcoin.

That's some magical thinking right there.  No digital currency goes universally mainstream over night John.  If it's not bitcoin, then, for sure, it will take a long time for another to reign supreme because there will be many trying to take Bitcoin's place.  Consensus can not be enforced universally, it has to be accepted universally.  That would take a very long time to get to that "universal" point.

Can't this be solved by a Gold/Silver scenario?
Like a combination of use of Bitcoin/Litecoin scenario?  I'm not sure of the inherent flaws of litecoin, so maybe another altcoin would suffice as the silver to Bitcoin's gold.
I know the community would have to buy into this scenario for it to work, but maybe there is no other way around it.
Though, the community coming together as a whole and doing so would be very profitable for them at this point.

Watch the tutorial.  Print off a moneygram.
Go to walmart.  They put all the info into the computer and you don't have to talk to anyone on the phone.  They also didn't ask for I.D. so you can use anybody's name and address.  I just made one up and it worked.
After the process, go home and you have bitcoins.  Don't sell them on ebay, you will get scammed 100%.

You do realize that even if you leave you still have to pay taxes right?  Even if you renounce your citizenship they are passing laws that make it so you still have to pay US taxes.
But back to my analogy.  For one, I haven't voted for anyone who was elected, and I've voted in every election since 1992.
Who are the 99% that agree?  You seem to be grabbing that number out of thin air.
I've worked since I was 16 and I'm 39 now.  I've worked at the same employer all along, so I think I've payed my fair share.  The thing is is that they are taking more and more from people like me and giving it to people that did NOTHING during the same amount of time.
Those people do not deserve my money.  I only have 11 more years to retire ( it would have been 9 if the people running things wouldn't be crooked as hell ).   But, after putting in my time, I may take your advice.
Anyways....research the LIBOR scandal.  Bankers stole trillions of our dollars and haven't been held accountable because they are GANGSTERS.  Trillions disappear at the pentagon also....nothing.  It's working people like me who pay for it, so no, I'm not going to sit around and listen to someone on the internet telling me to just magically "leave" when 21 years of retirement money is wrapped up in a State retirement account.  It isn't that easy, sorry.  I'd rather stay and fight for what I WORKED for than to let those greedy bastards steal everything I have.

But there is only a certain amount of bitcoins to be farmed.  They could try a 51% attack, but that would be stupid and would fail.

If you give me $300 free, I'll give you 3 bitcoins free.

How these stupid people get any sort of high level employment is beyond me.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:50:29
absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:22:06
Yes...they are getting REALLY desperate.

It's a storage of wealth that can act as a currency since it's easily transferable.  You can never separate the two even if you tried.

I did this and it completely fucked up my wallet with dust transactions.  I had to end up paying more to fix the problem than I collected.

Supply is regulated by the bitcoin software.

Apple is notorious for being technologically handcuffed.

I personally believe, eventually, that it will go to thousands of dollars a bitcoin.
What is it backed by?  It's backed not only by the inherently incorruptible nature of bitcoin, but also by the corruption and draconian forces of the alternative.
Bitcoin truly makes your money yours.  Nobody can tell you what you can do with it and nobody can confiscate or control it.

The difference is is the wealth is with the people, not a debt to an outside debtor that gathers wealth with no work performed.

It makes me feel good that bitcoins are in the hands of people that know what's going on.

Bitcoin in your pocket is much safer than gold or silver in your pocket.
This guy is a skeptic even though his own logic dictates him not to be.  The article was a bummer because after all that he still didn't get it.
@_date: 2013-05-02 23:33:50
How did you end up selling yours?

Either jealous, stupid or government paid trolls.

The TSA would love to find your gold and silver in your pockets when they stick their hands down your pants....

no no no...the IMF and the Federal Reserve have all these beat by FAR!
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:11:59
Probably because THEY were the ones that were stealing everybodies bitcoins with the scams.  I hate ebay/paypal for letting the scammer steal my money AND bitcoins.  I try never to use them again.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:44:41
Can't you comprehend that. 0.0000001 bitcoin could equal $100.  You get it now?

This proves that the DEA wants all the money to themselves.  Fuck them.  Fire them all and do away with the agency.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:16:34
To the moon!
@_date: 2013-08-30 09:27:34
that's obviously not the case then.  Also, hording btc drives up its value as long as people use smaller amounts for transactions.

they wouldn't need charity is the whole point.

Hey don't forget to buy extra bitcoins and buy stuff with them.  Support the system and watch your investments grow.

Make sure everybody you know is aware that this guy is an idiot, and for no reason, ever, should you listen to his business advice.
