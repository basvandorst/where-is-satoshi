I did too, but then I heard the guy in the London Real video say that Andreas was on JRE 4 times. I was like, "whaaaaaat?"

LOL. lmgtfy doesn't show episode 490 and that is why you think he only appeared in 3 episodes.

4 times. I'd tell you to google it but im not a dick: 446, 490, 581, and 844.

Until you get a safe, at least put it in a ziploc bag. That way a spilt soda/coffee/beer doesn't ruin your day.

To extend what you are saying, he would theoretically be fine investing in a Bitcoin mining company's stock but not in Bitcoin directly.

LOL no. I am not a government employee. I am however someone who benefits greatly from government.
For example, I drank milk this morning without wondering whether the farmer or dairy distributor was poisoning me with tainted milk or diluting it with [melamine]( I then left my house without worry about police fighting [armed gangs in the streets]( I drove to work on paved roads and while some people drove a bit over the speed limit mostly everyone maintained good order on the roads.
You either 1) live in a completely lawless area where there is no government, warlord, or criminal syndicate that maintains order, 2) are willfully ignorant of how your daily experiences are shaped by a government that relies upon taxes to function.

It's rough waiting a week for the transfer to go through. Hurts especially when the prices goes +500 in a week. Sometimes the coinbase fee is worth it to buy a dip.

Your logic has no place in the echo chamber /s

What does government add to Bitcoin? The government serves as a deterrent to the criminal who would enter your home and beat your private keys out of you with a stick.
But beyond that, taxes pay for public goods. Government does not have to "add value" to something in order to justify taxing it. If you don't live in a lawless region like the Pakistani border regions, you benefit daily from a reality created, supported, or protected by a government.

Good primer for beginners.

That subreddit is not the place. It is a discussion of the BTC financial market. It is not an actual market.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:21:31
What subreddit would be the appropriate place for trades?

Thank YOU for being a great communicator. The cryptocurrency community will be forever indebted to you.

Do you not believe in taxes? This is an unnecessarily sensational title. For those who don't read the article, South Korea wants to follow the lead of the US and Japanese governments. Capital taxes, etc. is exactly what Andreas Antanopodododidk advocates in multiple videos.
