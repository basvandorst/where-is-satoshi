localbitcoins might soon be added to the great wall of Chinese internet censorship.

Payments for products.
So I'm guessing that when it puts the transaction in the block, it also mentions all those inputs? I have to read that white paper because this is confusing.

Thank you! I received all the answers now. Good people here.

I did not know I can do that. Next time I'll use Electrum.

Can I select which address I want to send from in Electrum? The Ledger Bitcoin Wallet didn't allow me to select.

A secondary question would be... how do I select which address I want to send from? I couldn't find this option in the Ledger Bitcoin Wallet.

How is that more info though? It's been there since  November 21, 2016.

Doesn't really help they case much. They shouldn't have closed it in the first place.
I still like Coinbase though as a company. Remember that when the IRS wanted vast records, they went straight to court to fight the calling.
