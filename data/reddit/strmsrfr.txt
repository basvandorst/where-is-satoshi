Bitcoins are worth *something* because of their extrinsic value.  Having a bitcoin makes doing certain things either easier or possible.
But I gather your question is more along the lines of "why is a 1BTC worth $100 USD instead of $0.01 USD or $10,000 USD?"  That one's trickier.  I haven't checked myself but someone told me that historically BTC sold for about the cost of mining them.  I believe they are above that now, and to be honest I think it might be at this moment mainly because of people betting that their value will increase even further.
Right now there aren't a lot of items being sold in BTC (most things you buy with BTC are actually priced in another currency and sold based on the current exchange rate) and there isn't a large amount of money (relatively) being held in BTC.  In the future I expect more items will be sold in BTC and more people will hold large amounts that they won't sell for ridiculous prices, and the what you can get for a bitcoin will stabilize.  It would be very hard to predict at what exchange rate this starts happening, though.

That would be Bitfloor's fault, not Capital One's.  When I sent from 360 on April 4th it was picked up April 5th (a Friday) and Bitfloor didn't add it to my balance there until the 11th, which is just within the 3-5 full business days they said it could take.
I don't know why it takes Bitfloor so long to add a deposit to your balance, although I suspect it might have to do with their bank not clearing Capital One's deposits the day they are "picked up".
Anecdotal but I had an ING Direct account for years before they became Capital One 360 a few months ago, and I've always been very happy with it.  I've only dealt with Bitfloor over the last few days but I expect we will get our money back.

Simple, you just buy some bitcoins at the high price, transfer them over to the exchange with the low price, and then... dang.
On the other hand, this only becomes an issue if you don't have enough USD and BTC in each exchange to close the gap yourself.  If you do have enough, then after you've traded the prices are equal, and you can buy some BTC for your USD and sell them for the same on the other side.  If you don't have enough you just have to sit it out until someone else equalizes the prices, then you can do the transfer and wait for the next gap to form.

If enough people accept unconfirmed transactions for large amounts to make attempting this attack profitable, and a lot of people start attempting it, it would then be in the miners' best financial interest to include higher-feed transactions even if they arrive later.

When you rent out a rig you know about how much it is going to cost to run and you know how much money you are going to get from your tenant.
When you run a rig yourself, you know how much it is going to cost to run, but you don't know how many bitcoins you'll get (luck+difficulty changes) or how much you'll be able to buy with that unknown quantity of bitcoins.

The [Bitcoin Wiki page on transactions]( or the [Bitcoin Wiki page on change](
You could, as an analogy, consider the block chain like a list of transactions.  The transactions say things like "Transaction 413: Bob sends 1BTC to Mary and 1BTC to Alice."  But how do we know Bob has 2BTC to spend?  The transaction includes a reference to a previous transaction to prove Bob has the money: "Transaction 413: Bob takes the 2BTC he got in transaction 222 and sends 1BTC of it to Mary and 1BTC of it to Alice."  Now, to simplify the matter of checking that Bob really does have 2BTC to spend, each time a previous transaction is referenced all of the money Bob got in that transaction is spent.  So, he can send half of it to Mary and half to Alice, or he can send half to Mary and half back to himself, also if he sends half to Alice and doesn't say what to do with the other half the miner gets it as a fee.  Now, in my examples so far I had one source of money ("input") and two destinations of money ("outputs"), but an actual Bitcoin transaction can have as many inputs and outputs as needed (pedantic: there is actually a limit but it's high enough to ignore for most practical purposes).  So, for instance, we could say, "Transaction 1025: Bob takes 1.5BTC from transaction 612 and 0.5 BTC from transaction 512 and sends 1BTC to Mary, 0.5BTC to Alice, 0.2BTC to himself, and leaves 0.3BTC as a transaction fee."  In practice though I believe most transactions have two outputs: the intended recipient and a 'change' address controlled by the sender.  They will have as many inputs as are needed to cover the amount.

But that's not relevant; the important thing is that there will come a day after which no more bitcoins will be produced, but no such promises can be made about dollars.  I think the general expectation is that more and more dollars will be produced until the U.S. government ceases to exist.
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:58:55
Well, if you want to understand the actual mechanism.  With the exception of things like backing up wallets manually (which already seems archaic to me and will likely sound ludicrous in ten years), it's probably a good enough approximation to say "If I give someone a Bitcoin address of mine they can use it to send me money but not to take money from me, and transactions take a while before I can depend on them."
For me the big aha moment regarding how Bitcoin works was the realization that: There's actually no such thing as "a Bitcoin".

The miner writes the block.  They include the transactions either out of the goodness of their heart or to collect the transaction fee.  They can include any valid transactions.  There have been miners who have made blocks with no transactions (other than the first one which is the block reward).  When you make a transaction it pretty much gets relayed to the whole network.  It ends up in the block chain when (if) a miner includes it in a block.

This depends entirely on your situation and what you consider to be convenient.
If you have a bunch of bitcoins already just transfer them in.
ecu11b had a good experience with MoneyGram, but if you don't have a MoneyGram location near you or you want to move a lot of money (which you'd have to convert to cash to give to MoneyGram I believe) it could be a huge hassle.

Keep in mind what you are really doing with that is giving blockchain.info (and anyone who hacks into their system) the ability to spend your bitcoins.  Make sure you trust them enough to do that.

QT does require the whole blockchain.  It can take hours or days to download and process it the first time.  If the value you expect to receive was indeed sent to your address, that will be in the blockchain regardless of whether QT knows about it yet.  You can check by looking up the receiving address on blockchain.info ([example](  The secret key needed to send that value is stored in your wallet.dat file.
Personally I open up QT every day or two to synchronize even if I'm not sending or receiving bitcoins so I don't have to wait very long the next time.
Also, it might help to remember that personal checks usually take days to clear, so even if the blockchain takes 24 hours to download that's still faster.
And yes, you could use another client that doesn't download the whole blockchain or an online wallet.  It would be more convenient in some ways.  For me, I don't mind downloading the blockchain and only sending bitcoins from my own computer.

You don't think that employers should pay their employees a decent wage?
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:39:11
I believe the reason for this is that bitcoin transactions are irreversible and confirmed after about an hour, whereas *e.g.* checks can take days to bounce, and then the recipient is left with nothing.
Nobody wants to give someone bitcoins in exchange for a bad check.

My tentative conclusion is "never".
Whois says:
   Record expires on 13-Apr-2023.
   Record created on 13-Apr-2000.
   Database last updated on 15-Apr-2013 18:23:31 EDT.
So... maybe the answer is "just now"?

Bitcoin isn't guaranteed not to lose value though.  Well, maybe depending on your definition of value.

There are some things that limit the effect.  The price difference has to be enough to cover their costs (probably dominated by fees).  Another factor of that is the availability of coins.  You might think "Oh, someone is selling coins on this exchange for $100 and someone is buying them on this exchange for $120," so you buy 100 coins at $100, then you discover the person buying at $120 is only willing to buy 1.
I think the fact that the prices at the exchanges don't remain wildly divergent over the long run demonstrates that this is being done to some extent.

Yeah... the price of bitcoins can only go down... I hope he gets a lot of them!

That's almost perfect, except the difficulty changes every 2016 blocks.  If blocks come out every ten minutes that's two weeks.  However, if blocks suddenly started coming out e.g. every minute, the difficulty would go up after 33.6 hours (or less, since we'd probably be 1000 blocks towards a difficulty change already).

No.  The network automatically adjusts the difficulty in an attempt to keep the average block creation rate at 6 per hour.  A "confirmation" happens when a transaction enters a block, so overall this would not make confirmations faster.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:54:15
0.0000295 hashes per second is over 9 hours per hash, so at that rate you couldn't mine a block in less than ten minutes.
Glancing at the pseudocode for SHA-256, it looks like you might be able to get 64 people to work on part of the hash simultaneously.  Dividing the one person time by 64 gets 8 minutes and 50 seconds.  That assumes that you can split up all the work (which you can't) and that it takes no time for the 64 people to coordinate (obviously false).  Even so, this is close enough that I'd want to actually try it before saying it's impossible.
If you look at the question another way, it is absolutely possible.  Bitcoin mining uses a guess and check algorithm to find valid blocks.  All of this hashing business is the check step.  I think we could argue that technically, after you make a correct guess you've found a block, you just don't know it yet.  A human can definitely make a guess in under ten minutes, and there's a nonzero chance that the first guess will be correct.

If bitcoin-qt is demanding a transaction fee to send coins to yourself, try sending more or waiting until the coins are older.  [See here](  I wish people would be more straightforward about the fact that bitcoin-qt **requires** you to add on **"optional"** transaction fees in some situations.

I think the idea is that if it costs e.g. $100 to buy a bitcoin and $120 to mine one, you are in a better position buying regardless of what happens with prices later.
