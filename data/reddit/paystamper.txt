Did you go to paystamper.com and enter your address in the monitor section?

Yes, this will be optional. If your customer makes an order, the app generates a transaction number. The transaction number is basically a reference number that entails the details of the order. The customer can choose to have the transaction public or hidden. If the customer chooses hidden, the transaction details wouldn't be viewable unless they have the transaction number.

the customer sends the coins to an address generated by the app. The app then encodes the blockchain with the details. Next, it forwards the payment to the merchant.

Stealth addresses aren't for newbies. If you are trying to just use ONE static bitcoin address, use paystamper.com. Easy and free to receive detailed payments. Its new. Give us a try!! :)

All you are doing is receiving payments. You can see how much your customer paid. 0 risk.

I have a shameless plug
hopefully paystamper.com will be used to solve this issue for merchants. Neither merchant nor buyer needs to register any account, ever. All that is needed is for the merchant to have ONE bitcoin address to receive bitcoin payments. Done.

If I were storj, I'd just compete with dropbox. If they really can offer a better service, why not? Then once millions of people experience how great this BETTER drop box service is, they can educate people about the REAL storj.

use a different address, it's not recognized
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:29:07
Yes. They can put a qr code. Customers scan the code, enter the products, and pay to that one address. Boom!

Yes, I am focusing on simplicity. And SHOWING how certain individuals can gain an extreme advantage by using bitcoin. I'm going to stay away from the technical aspects of it, such as how does does bitcoin get from one address to another, how to buy bitcoins, anonymity, how to create a wallet, etc. Yes, those things are very important, but the video is intended to "lure" them into bitcoin.
