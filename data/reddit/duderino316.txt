I fail to see the Reddit ad/reference im the OP pic, someone mind pointing it out please?
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:34:36
And that is why you can't have nice things.
@_date: 2012-10-20 23:38:43
That's fucking awesome.
@_date: 2012-10-03 01:20:12
Seems legit.
@_date: 2012-12-10 21:55:22
Like a boss.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:26:15
This dude has a great point IMO: ["Imo promotors should stop even trying to explain technical details like mining to 'normal' people. It is irrelevant for the use case of a customer. Focus on advantages, good software and a short and smooth tutorial."](
@_date: 2012-11-29 22:34:20
It doesn't really matter, it's the principle of accepting Bitcoin payments that matters.
@_date: 2012-08-27 18:24:17
The general consensus by now is that [Pirate defaulted](
@_date: 2012-08-29 04:10:50


Yeah well tell that to the scammed persons in the Pirate ponzi, for the record I am not one of them.
@_date: 2012-08-28 22:54:20
Excellent, hopefully we'll get a service like this in Mexico soon.
@_date: 2012-08-23 17:08:13
You're close to bottom when you can't tell an orangutan from a chimpanzee!!!
@_date: 2012-08-21 16:53:56
@_date: 2012-08-23 14:05:31
Regarding the anon part of it you may be right but on the other hand this opens up a plethora of legitimate, big time uses for Bitcoin, which IMO is great.
@_date: 2012-09-26 03:58:58
Fucking awesome.
@_date: 2012-09-28 23:42:54
Exactly, let's help spread the word.
@_date: 2012-08-27 00:00:15
Read the link(s) and find out for yourself.
@_date: 2012-10-22 03:04:22
I am sorry but if you don't understand the concepts being used then you shouldn't concern yourself with these things.
@_date: 2012-09-21 21:10:15
I agree, my honest first reaction to this was either an inside job and consequently I totally expected them to shutdown, but this is an indication that this is hopefully not the case.
@_date: 2012-08-27 18:17:41
Same here, hopefully we'll be able to look at video of the speakers after the fact.
@_date: 2012-08-30 21:30:43


Guys I think this guy is actually serious!
@_date: 2012-08-27 23:09:07
Problem are the charges incurred for that private bank transfers, and also you have to do a conversion from the native currency to dollars/euros because the native coin is not accepted, this makes a single transaction not cost effective, a real domestic method would imply using our native currency (i.e. Mexican Pesos) to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-08-30 19:12:57
Dude you are falling apart, stop drinking and get over the Pirate scam already will you?
@_date: 2012-10-06 19:11:13
Fair enough.
@_date: 2012-09-10 14:14:32
There were no escrows and there were no btc exchanged.
@_date: 2012-11-16 03:16:30
Are those wood Bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-11-03 18:22:20


It's good to see the knowledge that Bitcoin early adopters have now going mainstream.
@_date: 2012-10-20 15:41:58
It's not clear to me from that translation if they are advicing on using Bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2012-08-23 14:14:11
non believer!
@_date: 2012-08-23 15:10:40
Oh, I misunderstood your post then, but now I am curious as to what exactly did you mean.
@_date: 2012-08-30 19:32:00
Wow you are in a worse condition than I could ever imagine. You better log out, stand up, go get cleaned and go out, do something in the real world. In the end everything will be alright mkay?
@_date: 2012-10-06 18:56:25
Add "Vader" to the list of names and you are complete.
@_date: 2012-08-29 03:26:30
Let's use this negative experience to try and get something positive out of it, IMO there is an important lesson to be learned here.
@_date: 2012-10-19 21:49:29
No doubt this will revolutionize Bitcoin, I can feel it.
@_date: 2012-09-12 03:53:28
10,012 3 hours later :)
@_date: 2012-10-20 04:55:13
Let me see what I can do.
EDIT 1: [I found the video]( does that help?
EDIT 2: I found a shorter version of the original gif: 
@_date: 2012-10-03 16:41:27
I see nothing new but the same old bullshit.

FYI: Replies from the bot take on average 7.5 minutes but may take 30 minutes or more in some cases.
@_date: 2012-08-26 01:09:08
You mean start paying ugly bitches with bitcoins to pose in a photo with you?
@_date: 2012-10-08 17:24:45


@_date: 2012-08-23 13:57:36
LOL well played.
@_date: 2012-10-06 18:38:52
En email is nothing, I've got a spam email account just for these cases.
@_date: 2012-12-14 01:11:51
Totally different animals.
@_date: 2012-10-19 21:02:51
EDIT: someone should edit those upvotes to Bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-09-15 21:34:02
Sadly most of them are concentrating on the mining aspect of Bitcoin and on the downsides to it.
@_date: 2012-08-30 21:25:01
Seems legit.
@_date: 2012-08-23 15:40:59
That's sadly true, all the illegal connotations are all you hear when you first hear about Bitcoin, it's only when you get to really dive in and really get to know the depth of Bitcoin that your eyes open up to all sorts of possibilities.
@_date: 2012-08-23 20:54:05
@_date: 2012-10-04 18:32:25
Awesome article.
@_date: 2012-08-30 17:23:00


@_date: 2012-08-22 15:56:21
What about Latin America, what's the best option?
@_date: 2012-12-11 20:04:10
Thank you for sharing this and please keep us updated with your experience.
@_date: 2012-10-20 15:46:14
It does work, if you don't specify it defaults to BTC, you can also specify USD BTW.
@_date: 2012-08-29 03:16:12
No [it's not](
@_date: 2012-10-26 15:16:25
I was wondering the exact same thing, OP really did a shitty job of setting this thread up, I found this: 
@_date: 2012-08-26 01:12:22
A fool and his money...
@_date: 2012-08-01 02:35:03
Dude is the offer over? 
I got an account made but no BTC.
@_date: 2012-12-10 20:11:09
Is that your car pictured?
@_date: 2012-08-14 23:58:24
Would this work in any country?
@_date: 2012-11-03 18:30:30
Has any Mt. Gox culpability ever been proven?
@_date: 2012-08-23 15:34:11
Ok I'll start:
1. I am located in Mexico
2. Interested in a small starting amount as a test (~5 BTC).
3. For long term hold.
4. Willing to reveal as much personal info. as necessary considering my limitations (location).
5. Wait time is no problem as long as it's **secure**.
@_date: 2012-08-31 19:39:31
You seem to ignore a very important point here: the way a ponzi works is by establishing a trust first, because when it starts it does pay out, in full and on time, so a trust is created, those initial paid accounts tell everyone else not lies but their reality, that is that the ponzi scammer paid them in full and on time, this is how the web of trust is easily circumvented, therefore what everyone else is saying here still applies, the best way to detect a scam is if it sounds too good and too shady to be true, it probably is.
@_date: 2012-08-27 16:58:34
I will definitively look into it, thanks.
@_date: 2012-08-26 20:55:30
Wrong, bitlane did, and [very publicly too]( and Pirate did make out an example out of him, maybe that's why everyone is so hesitant to say anything publicly. EDIT: so have others and they have received the same treatment, so this is definitively why no one is saying anything publicly: 
@_date: 2012-11-28 21:24:51
History in the making gentlemen.
@_date: 2012-08-23 14:08:20
This is great news for the entire Bitcoin movement.
@_date: 2012-10-06 19:04:33
And I suppose your name IRL is "puanerd" right? People know nefario, as well as his real name you know.
@_date: 2012-09-09 22:06:14
Nice try Matthew Neal Wright!
@_date: 2012-08-29 19:25:04
Any decent ponzi does not necessarily need accomplices since the initial investors are paid out full and on time and they give up a good rep for the ponzi artist.
@_date: 2012-09-23 03:30:55
Very interesting, thanks for posting this.
@_date: 2012-08-27 16:41:53
If I can do a wire transfer from Mexico to UKash and them buy bitcoins at BitcoinNordic then I would say yes it does, is that the case tho?
@_date: 2012-09-07 17:52:46
Yeah regardless of the outcome of all of this this is a great publicity stunt for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-08-29 01:48:45
This is a significant timeline in bitcoin history.
@_date: 2012-08-28 23:06:10


 
This made me laugh, do we really fall into those categories?
@_date: 2012-08-22 22:39:21
In case anyone is wondering that's a total of 5,231.89 btc of "Yes" bets. 
I guess you could say that is pretty good bet considering Pirate just started paying back.
@_date: 2012-09-07 17:50:51
And there is no such thing as bad publicity.
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:22:30
I disagree, "Spanish Speakers" is more adequate, "Hispanic" is not a spoken language.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:59
These were prophetic words my man!
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:06:48
Ok I'll byte: so, are you 1 person or are you a group of persons that created Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-02-07 00:02:00
Dude if you could make it so that you can buy Bitcoins with air time that would be great, specially for those 3rd world countries that have a hard time buying Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:49:46
Holy shit it's amazing the ammount of effort you put in talking shit about Bitcoin it makes me curious and I gotta ask: what's in it for you?
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:43:20
killhamster is so dedicated to spreading Bitcoin FUD that it does make sense.
@_date: 2013-02-24 02:15:30
I would think the owner of the place they are placed at, that's why they buy them.
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:02:02
It's in the OP.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:42:31
He returned those bitcoins: 
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:07:58
I don't think it works on negative/useless/retarded posts, if that was the case then would be fucked and no he would not be allowed to post in this sub.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:08
Go into "Settings console", click on "Filters", type on domain e.g. "imgur" and then customize "apply to" accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:29:53
Same here, guess no one likes to hear bad news around here.
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:39:39


I dunno, I don't trust you.
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:11:13
no idea, but he should be easy to detect, just look for someone spreading Bitcoin FUD like he does here in reddit
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:48:12
He actually declined them: 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:32:04
Dumb question but why not CCs?
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:56:31
This is fucking awesome.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:39:14
Pro-tip: the TL/DR section is supposed to be the last part of your OP, not the first like you have it now.
@_date: 2013-02-19 17:39:51
Excelente articulo, gracias.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:12:33
Pro-tip: use RES and do this yourself. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:15:14
Pro-tip: your "Pro-Pro-tips" suck.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:11:35


Just wondering how come you are so sure about this?
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:07:49
I've got that feeling that we already waited long enough, we are way behind dude.
@_date: 2013-02-13 22:56:41
302 right now.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:53:57
Oh shit and you are having no luck so far eh? Well good luck with that endeavour.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:02:28


@_date: 2013-08-29 00:23:20
What about his latest one where he addresses all the accusations against him: 
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:40:46
Bitcoin mining malware everywhere!
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:08:06
I agree with your thoughts, it is his baby after all how can he not care?
