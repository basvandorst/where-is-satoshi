Well Wire transfer takes $40 to send $1  (same amount up to $10 000), but for any small amount it takes a lot of % per tx...
So btc fee is way lower, and usually takes only few cents if you are not in a hurry and you know what you are doing...

well not really, this is only if you need it fast, and the problem is that some bad people like Bcash supporters flood the true BTC with transactions just to make it impossible for the real transaction to pass. There is no real need for this...

I send transactions in December and Nov. for 1 sat in BTC and they go after 1 or 2 blocks, so...

lol they send near 0 fee transactions and not $10, but anyways...

Well the idea is not to have too big amount of BTC/month to one individual... That is why the limit...

He said It is still not the time...
Some time in the future when there is a real need, not when the owner of .com is flooding the network, just to promote his shitcoin as bitcoin...
And still his transactions are more expensive and slower then Bitcoin... (they have x8 the blocksize)

Well I am keeping that 1BTC for Tesla...

Well I have the same problem for over a month now.
IT was stuck for long time @ 3mil blocks behind.
Then I notice when I start it it gets few blocks and then stops.
So I looked around and figured out the problem was in geth crashing, so I looked and found "better" version (previously I used the official wallet, latest version).
I was able to get almost all blocks with it. then I started the client and it had like 180 blocks or so... never was able to get the full node...
Now when I start it it connects to nodes and dies unknown why. So yeah this is mission impossible...

You can allays use SAT to obtain your BTC. No need for internet...
As long as you got your keys safe they are yours to keep.
And as it is possible to access the blockchain via SAT there is no need for the internet.
btw to make transactions you can send sms to a service that will put it into the blockchain, so yeah no internet needed at all.

It is a balloon do not invest in it...

Well Visa has a 3-4% transaction fee that in some cases you need to cover, and it is good for small transactions, but when it comes to big ones it fails, as the fee is way too big to settle. SWIFT transaction for small amounts is killer (31E for up to 10k Euro). I know SEPA is cheaper, yet not all banks support this type of transactions.
You can still send transactions in BTc (if not in a hurry) for less then $1. So the problem is that some people flood the blockchain in order to force us to accept the increase of size, yet we do not need it. If we do it it will be bad for us, as the size will keep increasing and eventually will be impossible to have in everywhere and only few centralized locations will have full nodes...
This is not good idea, even Satoshi said back in 2009 there is time when the size will need increase and it needs to be made at the last possible time, as else it will be bad for BTC...

The problem will be then they will not be able to steal... all will be publicly visible... so they will not be willing to do it by themselves...
that's the reason no gov wants to adopt it willingly...
I think Swiss will be the one that will have no problems adopting it, but the rest will struggle b4 accepting it...
The BIG problem is that banks will not be able to do money laundering and finance crime if all goes crypto...
After all lots of banks just got accused of even bigger scam/ML then before, and still more then 95% of all illegal acts are done in cash, as they do not leave any trace...
That is the reason why $100 bills are printed more and more, and now are greater number then the $1 bills...
EDIT: ahh and Bulgaria as a country does not have btc, but there are some big Bulgarian players on the crypto world and they hold probably lots of coins...

lol the idea is that blocks are empty and there is no need to waste that many satoshi, when you can get into the next block with just few satoshi/byte... when I send btc I pay 1 sat/byte and they go in on next block, last year when ppl had to pay that much for transactions I was still able to send transactions with same fee, but it took like 3-8 blocks to get into.
There is no need for increase of block size, there is a need to educate people, as there are lots of ignorant people and some bad ppl who trick them into thinking that btc transactions should cost a lot...
Ignorance brings problems and never helps, so educate yourself and you will not need others to tell you what to do and how.
That way you will succeed in life!
