What are you talking about?  Did you even read what I posted?  I said Bitcoin deflation concerns me because I don't think employers will want to pay employees in Bitcoin because of it.  Bitcoin deflation will not be mild deflation, it will be hyper-deflation after 2030.  A good currency is more stable, mild deflation or inflation.  
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:22:00
Not yet.  It's still in its infancy.  First of all, right now there are a lot of new coins coming onto market, pushing the price down.  Second, there have been a lot of problems with exchanges.  Lastly, it still has a very small market share of the currency market.  Once Bitcoin production tapers off in a few years and exchanges stabilize, if Bitcoin demand goes up, it's price will skyrocket.

The problem with Bitcoin is I think it will be hyper deflationary (over 100% deflation annually).  Too much saving is just as problematic for an economy as too much spending.  
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:10:39
People don't want to have to re-negotiate wages every week, which is what we will have to do with Bitcoin hyper-deflation.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:25:31
And will eventually be hyper deflationary.  I never said it wasn't infinitely divisible.  I know this.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:30:55
Deductive reasoning.  Given that Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, and given that people will lose them, that means that of those 21 million, we will constantly have fewer and fewer Bitcoins.  That as opposed to more and more people wanting them as more people learn about them and gain internet access, this will result in hyper-deflation, given more and more people want them and demand them.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:03:59
I never said it will always rise in value.  If people stopped wanting it, its value would plummet to zero.  The point I am making, is given that demand is constant, then yes, it's value will rise.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:59:13
Sorry if this was already posted, I could not find it.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:09:00
1.  I agree with your reasoning.  However, I still think people  don't like getting paid less, regardless.  
Another point though, is that Bitcoin will be hyper-deflationary.  This will make pricing (including wages) extremely difficult for people.
2. It will really depend on if the reward is worth the price.  If the reward is greater than the price, then you will be right.  If it is not, than I will be right.

I am just saying I think an inflationary crypto currency is superior to Bitcoin, like Peercoin or Dogecoin, and that those will become the change that I had originally thought Bitcoin would be.  
Reviewing the two I think Peercoin is superior to Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:26:57
You love it as a wage.  You don't understand.  If you were a business owner, and it becomes hyper deflationary as it will, then you would hate to pay wages with it.  You would hate to price goods with it.  It will be a terrible currency.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:17:27
Or, there could be an inflationary alt coin that would work for both...
Inflation is NOT necessarily detrimental nor criminal, as I think most libertarians believe.  But mild inflation is definitely acceptable, and highly preferable to hyper deflation.
What is criminal is a gang calling themselves government, making currency competition illegal, and then getting all the benefits of inflation for them and their cronies.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:26:51
Or in a crypto currency that doesn't have that problem.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:34:48
And over the last three years it has gone up 1000% or more or whatever.  But I am not talking about today.  I am talking about ten years down the road when there is much more widespread use of it and far fewer being produced every day, and we see it going up almost every day in value, and people realize that it is hyper deflationary and then everyone stops using it, switches to a crypto currency that is not hyper deflationary and its price goes to zero.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:18:37
How so?  I see Bitcoin becoming hyper-deflationary.  That is a terrible attribute for a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:13:27
"Edit: So far most everyone is suggesting we just process returns in $US, which is fine, except that really proves that BTC is not a currency, but a payment method. Either way, that's not a solution, because our bosses will just say to let people get cash for their BTC on exchanges and use that at our stores."
If that is your company's attitude, then I hope your company dies soon.  Obviously, your company doesn't think the customer is always right.  But as Bitcoin becomes more popular, more people will have Bitcoins to spend, and if they have the option of going to a place that accepts them vs one that does not, they will go to the one that accepts them.
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:59:49
Re-read what I posted.  I said employers will most likely not want to pay employees in Bitcoin not that employees would not want to be paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:29:34
Well, it depends on your time frame.  In the last few months it has been hyper inflationary.  Previous to that though, it was hyper deflationary.  I am talking about if it though from the perspective of when it has much more market penetration.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:32:49
Hyper deflationary?  That means the value of Bitcoins goes up extremely fast.  Today 1 BTC can buy a hot dog, tomorrow ten, the next day 20, and so on so forth.  Or another example is it means today I can hire one person for 1 BTC, the next day I could hire 10 people for 1 BTC, the next 20, and so on so forth.  If it goes up that fast in value, then I have to renegotiate daily with my employees how many BTC they are getting paid.  That is time consuming.  That is terrible for a currency.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:23:52
That only works if the fiat currency is not hyper-inflationary nor hyper-deflationary.  If a crypto currency becomes the default currency of the world (I think one that is slightly inflationary), then no one would want to negotiate a wage in a fiat currency.  They would want the crypto currency.  I am saying the eventual hyper deflationary aspect of Bitcoin will make it a far inferior crypto currency to other crypto currencies that are not hyper deflationary.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:11:50
My point is that Bitcoin will be hyper-deflationary, making pricing extremely difficult for people, scaring employers away from paying employees in it, because they will have to re-negotiate wages with them too much.

What doesn't make sense?  That employers will not want to pay employees in a hyper-deflationary currency?
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:20:02
Did you read my post?  I said employers would not want to pay employees in a hyper-deflationary currency.  I did not say people would not want to be paid in a hyper-deflationary currency.

Correlation may be indicative of causation, that's where a study would need to be conducted.

Why?  Bitcoins are infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:09:22
"What stops people from using other virtual currencies?"  Nothing.  A better question is why would people choose Bitcoin over other virtual currencies?  It has a much larger infrastructure built up for it.
"What gives bitcoin its value apart from people believing it has some value?"  They are limited to 21 million, they can be transacted in anonymously, and they are very cheap to send.
"Real money has the gold reserves of the central bank that at least partially back it up"  No fiat currency in the world is backed by gold.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:50:51
"The protocol can be extended to allow for more divisibility - up to infinity."  Awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:32:02
It's the same as every other lull in the price.  More people find out about BTC, research and wait for the price to start going up, and then buy them.  I think in 3-4 months we will see another price climb, this time up to $10,000 per BTC before it pulls back to $8,000.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:05:33
Or they have thousands of bitcoins so they don't care if they spend 91 on a nice car.  The reason they spent them is really irrelevant.  The point is that deflation does not keep people from spending money.

Divisibility does not guarantee there are enough to go around if enough are lost.  If enough are lost, eventually the value will go up enough that Bitcoins will not be useful for small purchases.  When merchants cannot sell their cheapest goods for Bitcoins because Bitcoins are too valuable, people will be forced to use a different currency and that will hurt Bitcoins and eventually be the end of Bitcoins.
It doesn't matter if lost coins are indistinguishable from coins in storage.  People that are storing coins would simply have to move them every few years to a new wallet.  If they didn't they would lose their coins.  Their loss for not being responsible.
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:26:50
You are right.  I was unable to edit my post earlier.  That is awesome.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:51:57
"And they have to do that why exactly?"  They would have to do that if the software were written such that your coins could be mined if they were dormant for five years.  It could be 100 years, or whatever the programmer wanted to make the number.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:36:14
Who worries about losing $10?  Your friend is obviously an idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:47:40
So as a business owner then, you would not want to setup your own bitcoin wallet and manage it yourself? 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:01:40
You can use bitinstant, but their fees are a lot higher than coinbase.
It's hard to buy them because of government regulations.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:44:28
Which software are you talking about?  Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:05:39
"Bitcoins are divisible to 0.00000001, so there being fewer bitcoins remaining is not a problem for the currency itself. If you lose your coins, all other coins will go up in value a little. Consider it a donation to all other bitcoin users. "
Wrong.  A property of a currency is that it must be divisible.  But that implies divisible to a small enough portion to make a small enough purchase.  If enough Bitcoins are lost, the value of the remaining Bitcoins will rise too much to be useful for small purchases.
"A related question is: Why don't we have a mechanism to replace lost coins? The answer is that it is impossible to distinguish between a 'lost' coin and one that is simply sitting unused in someone's wallet."  
That is not a problem.  Like I said, if the program is written to allow mining for coins that have been dormant for at least five years, people that are saving them would simply have to move them to a different wallet before five years is up.
