Double spends are expensive, so for most retail purchases just receiving a 0-conf transaction is good enough proof that there won't be a double spend.  Why would anyone spend $X+Y to steal goods worth $X?
Including a higher fee will make it more likely for miners to include your transaction in the next block they find, but nothing you do can increase the speed at which those blocks are found, so the 10 minute average is the best you can do on that end.

Basically the blocks will have a very high capacity for transactions (~1M) and be of a fixed size regardless of how many transactions are included. This fixed the propagation speed issue and should mean all available transactions with any fees should be included in every block.

An anti-Bitcoin stance taken by any government would simply push talent and capital outside their borders.  If Bitcoin ever gets to a point where its use as a tax evasion tool becomes so severe that the government/banks have to take action, they most certainly will not do it in such a way that destroys the economic viability of Bitcoin, so your argument is invalid.
You haven't shown that taxation == destruction in any way, and it's a major facet of your original argument.

For your first point, there's an established algorithm, so all a developer would have to do is expose the calculation process.
AS for your second point, this change doesn't affect the protocol at all, just the bitcoin-qt client, so will only directly affect users of that and Armory.  Other client developers are free to do whatever they want to do regarding the transmission of small transactions.
I think this whole thing is being analysed to the point of absurdity; the change will happen and we will see what happens and Gavin will make adjustments as required.  We would all do well to remember that essentially *everything* about Bitcoin is in beta.

Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. The inputs are outputs of previous transactions and have finite sizes.  Transactions combine all inputs and then separate them into multiple outputs, like melting down gold coins into new shapes. The portion you get back is your change and is paid to change addresses.
For example, someone pays you 1.0 XBT in one transaction and you want to spend 0.35 of it, the transaction created pays 0.35 to them and 0.65 to a change address for you.

In the case of simple sales tax, it's up to the vendor to charge and remit taxes to the government, so all you have to is pay the price including tax to them. For something more complex like a car purchase where tax is paid upon registration, you will have to use a payment method supported by that vendor, which is likely your local fiat currency, but could be any currency, including Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:52:08
Explain to me how using Bitcoins helps a company avoid taxation.
Sales taxes could be collected the same way as today, income taxes could be remitted the same as today, and corporate taxes are based off of financial statements and all public companies would be committing far worse financial crimes than tax evasion if hey were cooking their books.  So that leaves basically private enterprises, the majority of which are small businesses which are already frequently overlooked for taxation issues.
@_date: 2013-03-11 12:31:11
What are you talking about?  Bitcoin is already subject to all normal forms of taxation, and using bitcoin to avoid paying taxes is tax fraud.

I should have been able to see this clearly before, but it seems that economists don't have to be good at math.
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:15:40
Taxes are the consequence of your economic actions and the impact that those actions have on the physical aspects of the world around you. 
You propose that taxes are akin to extortion, while I believe that refusal to pay taxes is equivalent to theft from society. 
I do not, and propose that everyone should not, trust the actions or motives of the institutions which govern me, yet I recognise their importance in the ongoing functioning of society. I do not agree with some of their actions, and I work tirelessly to oppose those actions, but I also understand that without them I would be unable to live the life that I have. This is different from extortion because without the government I will have to either perform those roles or trust someone else to perform those roles for me in order to mitigate risks and avoid threats, whereas without the gangsters there would be no more threat or risk. 
I will conceded that some aspects of government control have decidedly more of a gangster quality to them, where both the threat and relief from the threat are government actions (prohibition leading to police action against individuals who are only harming themselves, military interventions leading to unprecedented terrorist events, etc.), but the solution is electing politicians that feel the same way I do, or moving to a place where such politicians are already elected - not simply destroying the government entirely.

Bitcoin is exactly like sending cash in the mail except it's instant and the post office never "loses" your envelope.
I will agree with your other point, if you'll consider the following:  
1. Debit cards are as secure as your bank is.  Cypriots are not too impressed with their banks right now, and normal people know that fear as well.  
2. Credit Cards are a means to an end that incur a cost on society while providing marginal benefits, one of which I will concede is security.  Normal people who own small businesses will do almost anything to avoid paying fees on accepting credit cards, which are typically in the 3-7% range.  
3. The benefits gained by using Bitcoin (speed, security, pseudonymity, etc.) sometimes will and sometimes won't exceed the benefits gained by using other methods of payment.  I think a good analogue to this is the consumer shipping industry - you package; sometimes it's a guitar that you want insured, signed for, delivered next-air by air, and sometimes it's just a postcard to your ex-girlfriend.

Tax evasion is reducing your tax burden illegally, tax avoidance is doing it within the legal framework provided by various governments. This would be evasion rather than avoidance because the OP is aware of their tax burden and didn't suggest any legal means of reducing it (like charitable donations or buying a failing business). Moving funds to another country to avoid detection and the subsequent payment of taxes owed is exactly tax evasion.

I guess that's not really escrow in the traditional sense, but as all bitcoins are in the blockchain all the time anyway, there's no need for anyone to hold the funds, just to ensure that they're properly released.  Most n of m transactions won't even require the third party's intervention.

Oh, so people who save money lose a little, and people who spend money gain a little.  Well, why is that a good thing?


This line should read, 'this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it can be the basis of a healthy global economy if the transfer of money leads to the aggregate accumulation of wealth.'


Ah, the old deflationary spiral gag.  This is an old trick, and they've been pulling it off for so many years now it's hard to see that they're only telling the buyer half of the story.  Consider that every transaction has a buyer and seller, and these transactions can be chained together from production to consumption, with each player taking a small profit for their time and trouble.
When you have an inflationary currency, the buyer has an incentive to spend because their money will be worth less over time, but the seller has basically no incentive to take money except that they use it to pay their bills.  By design of the currency, the seller will need to sell more and more of the same product in order to have the same level of profit (this effect is compounded by having to pay for supplies with this inflating currency as a buyer as well).  Over time, this means that the seller will have to decrease the quality of goods, offer lower pay and longer periods between increases, or reduced levels of customer service in order to stay profitable.
On the other hand, when you have a deflationary currency, the buyer has no incentive to buy except for necessity and desire.  The seller, though, has *every* reason to want to sell, and since the buyer doesn't want to part with their hard eared currency, the seller must provide some sort of exceptional value.  Sometimes this value will be that 'this pizza will be delivered in 30 minutes or less', sometimes the value is that 'these tiles are hand-painted,' and sometimes the value is that 'Jim really knows a lot about fixing bicycles.'  Sellers will be earning money by holding cash, but they'll still need to buy things to consume in production, and they'll be able to invest in things like better materials, higher wages, experimental r&amp;d, and better customer service.

Well, fine, but I'm warning you it sounds a bit stupid, and I don't know enough about some of the things I talk about to know if this is even possible.
My idea is to put a hashing function into some piece(s) of software or hardware (ideas: browser plugin, linux distro, usb drive, BIOS chip, etc.) that functions as a sort of casual miner whenever the computer is running but idle, that uses whatever hardware is available to mine very slowly.  I'd focus on reducing the power &amp; memory consumption so that it would be as unnoticeable as possible, and it would be setup to work as a p2pool of some kind and only require an address for payout to work.
My idea is that even if having really low power consumption means 1MH/s on average, if enough devices (i.e. everything consumers own) were connected to the pool there would be a tiny tiny tiny tiny income stream for everyone involved, and it would support the security of the network without having any central source.

You would keep track of all transactions in a FIFO manner, and accumulate realized gains as you went along selling them.
If you buy 10 @ $10, you have a cost basis of $100, and every time you sold, you'd be responsible for the capital gains for the amount greater than $10 that you sell them for.
Sell 1 @ $100, capital gain is $90   
Sell another @ $200, capital gain is $190, total of $280  
Sell another @ $300, capital gain is $290, total of $570  
Sell another @ $400, capital gain is $390, total of $960  
Sell another @ $500, capital gain is $490, total of $1450  
Sell another @ $600, capital gain is $590, total of $2040  
Sell another @ $700, capital gain is $690, total of $2720  
Sell another @ $800, capital gain is $790, total of $3510  
Sell another @ $900, capital gain is $890, total of $4400  
So now you have 1 BTC, with a $10 basis, and $4400 in realized gains which are now taxable.

I'll add that there are change addresses involved, so sometimes you do create transactions that have a total output value higher than you sent to the vendor because of the way that transactions are created/accounted.
Often when you create a transaction, one of the outputs is back to you (the same address or another you own, depending on the wallet/settings).  This is called a change address, and it is completely normal to see these kinds of outputs automatically added to your transactions.
Cash works the same way.  Lets say you have a $100 bill and you want to buy something for $50, you give the vendor your $100 bill, and they give you a $50 bill back and put the $100 bill in their drawer.  The transaction here has a single input of $100 and two outputs of $50 - the difference being that in Bitcoin you pay the vendor exactly and just give yourself the change amount.

I wasn't comparing values, I was showing that there's *literally* no difference between zeros on one side of the decimal point or the other in terms of ease of comprehension, regarding your comment:


I don't disagree that the various denominations should be available in more places, but that's an issue that needs to be taken to the software and website developers, not every 4 hours.
If you want to make the switch, then go ahead and do so, but don't proselytise about how the Average Joe is too retarded to understand how numbers work so everybody should make the change with you.  We already have flexible denominations for money, and while I understand the desire to set the basic unit so that the minimum unit is hundredths so that it mimics *most* currencies, it really doesn't matter, as long as you can refer to them distinctly.  
The same way that if I say $1.1M you know I mean $1100000, I should be able to say 1 BTC and you can know that means 1000mBTC; it doesn't matter what base unit is used.
The important thing is that we have names that everyone agrees on, which we do; everything else to do with denominations is your own personal decision.  There might be some merit to the argument that people are unwilling to buy because they don't understand the divisibility of Bitcoin, but that's really an argument to educating those people better rather than dumbing down the standards.

You do still owe capital gains taxes on the realized gains from your Bitcoin purchase.

You now have 0.9BTC, which you don't have to pay taxes on yet, and a meal worth $10 that was paid for with a bitcoin that cost $1, so you have to pay capital gains taxes on $9.

This line is incorrect:


You are comparing the fee which is charged on total transaction size with the fee relative to profit, but it's not a valid metric because the fee is not dependent on the profit involved.
If you bought 1 BTC for $0.01, and Mt.Gox took their 0.6% from that, you'd have .994 BTC.  If, when the price rose to $100 you sold it, and MtGox took their 0.6%, you get paid $98.80, having paid exactly 1.2% in fees.
The only reason this works is because in this case the profit approximates the total value of the transactions.  As those totals diverge, the size of the fees relative to profit increases, as you've shown, while the fees relative to transaction size remain exactly 0.6%.
@_date: 2013-05-08 12:45:46

* Sent back to the address which would require the cashier to take all the BTC off and pay the change back on (Wouldn't that count as 2 transactions and therefore 2 fees?)
* Could the cashier just return the change to the originating address automatically? (only 1 fee?)
All transactions are the output of the previous transactions to that address, so if you moved the 0.1BTC in with one transaction, the only way to spend it as you have said is to create a transaction with a 0.1BTC input, and two outputs, of 0.02 and 0.08 BTC.  It doesn't matter what address you pay out to, though some people (myself included) would argue that you'd have to be crazy to keep using the same wallet that you just gave away the private key to.

Anyone knowing about Bitcoin and was mining from the early days could be considered 'simply very lucky' then, not necessarily just the creators of the protocol.  
If we can assume for the moment that there was only one creator, then their ability to mine coins would decrease as quickly as the network of miners grew (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.).  Up until very recently you didn't even need anything more specialised than a decent gaming computer to mine sufficient amounts of BTC, that seems far more evenly distributed than gold and the capital needed to mine gold.

Again, not a mistake.  I was showing that "more leading zeros" is a bad argument because it's exactly the same as placeholder zeros on the other side of the decimal point.  I am fully aware that 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC = 1000000 uBTC, my point is that people need to choose based on the situation:
|1| 1000| 1000000||BTC|
|.1|100|100000|| BTC|

What's the benefit to them of controlling a large portion of the network, if not to perform a 51% attack?

I know this is sort of the opposite of what you guys want to hear, but online taxation of goods sold for Bitcoins would be trivial for businesses to implement.
You could make the remittance part of the customer's transaction, so that the business never touches it at all and the onus of reporting and recording would be on the state. The business would have receipts for all transactions (and blockchain transactions to back those up), and would have already submitted all of their required taxes.  There would be an issue with refunds, but I'm sure that could be mitigated somehow.
I think this nullifies most of the arguments against the bill (other than arguments against sales tax in general).
On the other hand, this bill is still very unclear about a few things:  
If I don't need to know the user's physical address, am I required to find out so that I can charge taxes? I bet there will be a huge rise in people who live in New Hampshire buying eBooks and other intangible items that are delivered by email. 
What if I'm a resident of one state and make an order to another state with a credit card that has a billing address in yet another state?  How will the business determine which address to tax me under?
If citizens lie about their address to a website in order to not pay sales tax, are they committing a crime?  I would argue that individuals still aren't required by law to pay sales taxes on out of state purchases until their income tax remittance, so until they fail to do so they haven't done anything illegal.  Since even the Senators admit that law is not enforced, this is a huge grey area.
Why is the creation of new laws a better solution than the enforcement of the existing laws?  As residents who are already supposed to claim their unpaid sales taxes on online purchases with their income tax submission to the state don't, the implication is that the law is either unjust or unenforceable which leads me to believe the existing laws should be amended rather than new laws bandaged over top of them.

You are an MSB if you are in business in Canada to offer any of the following services to the public:
Foreign exchange dealing
* conducting transactions where you exchange one type of money or currency (like US dollars, Canadian dollars, or Euros) for another.
Money transferring
* transferring funds from one individual or organization to another using an electronic funds transfer network or any other method such as hawala, hundi, fei ch'ien, and chit.
Cashing or selling money orders, traveller's cheques or anything similar"

@_date: 2013-02-26 21:58:47
Lets say you own a chip-making factory, and you have 4.0GH/s worth of ASICs that you haven't turned on or told anyone about.  During the past 2016 blocks / ~2 weeks, the average global hash rate was 4.3GH/sec, and the Bitcoin protocl calculates that the new difficulty is ~3M so that 2016 blocks will be solved in about 2 weeks.  The second that the difficulty level changes, you flip on all your ASICs and suddenly the global hash rate jumps up to 8.3GH/sec.  
Assuming the fluctuations of other miners on the global hash rate aren't negatively affected by your efforts, the next 2016 blocks get bumped out by you and the rest of the miners in only about 1 week.  **Congratulations, you've earned ฿24000**.
Now, the Bitcoin protocol bumps the difficulty level up to ~6M, and the next 2016 blocks start being processed.  If you leave your ASICs on, you'll earn ~฿12000/week (diminishing as the global hash rate grows).  If you turn your ASICs off, you have to wait 4 weeks for the difficulty level to go back down to ~3M so that you can mine for another week.
Over the course of a year (52 weeks for simplicity) that works out to:
    24000+(12000)*51 = ฿636000
    OR
    24000*(52/5) = ฿249600
So, using the scheme you've suggested you would lose out on 60% of your potential profit (in the first year), which at today's prices translates to losing ~$12M USD in this case.

What is it that you're having trouble understanding?
When you broadcast a transaction it will be picked up almost immediately by the receiver's client, with 0 confirmations.  This is a verified transaction, as the clients won't accept an invalid transaction, and for most purposes that's all that's needed to establish trust that the payment is being made and won't be double-spent.  
Waiting for the transaction to be added to a block is additional confirmation that the bitcoins will end up in your possession, but in most cases for any purchases worth less than the value of a block reward (~$2800 USD right now) the merchant can be almost certain that they won't be ripped off even without any new confirmations.

The information is stored in files, that are shared on a p2p basis with all nodes.  That's the blockchain.  If you download and use the bitcoin-qt client you'll download an entire copy of it, and when you connect to a node who doesn't have it all, you'll send them a few blocks.
I'm not entirely sure, but based on the amount of time it takes to start up, I would guess that yes the entire blockchain is scanned when the bitcoin-qt client is started.  But there are clients that don't require the full blockchain to be on your system, where a server (or network of servers) does that end of things and the client just asks for the balance for each address.
The client doesn't have to do anything when accepting a transaction, just each miner/pool has to scan enough of the blockchain when creating the block to ensure that the inputs haven't been spent. When creating a block, each miner does the verification of the transactions in that block, and then when another block is added onto that, as long as there are no conflicts, then that acts like additional verification on the block.
If you're confused about the private key thing you should read up about [public key cryptography]( it's a key concept.

1. It's on the wiki - 
2. They don't really, but they do sort of.  A wallet is a collection of private keys (well, of accounts that contain private keys, but most people have one account per wallet).  A private key is used to prove ownership of a particular address (which is the public key) in signing the transactions, and the addresses functions sort of like locations in the public ledger.
2b. When a bitcoin is mined, the initial transaction of the block creates an output to the address(es) of the miners who created it, and all transactions after that reference that output as their input.  So, each transaction has a unique number, but the bitcoins themselves do not.  (I mean, it's best to think of bitcoins not being a thing you have, you have access to receipts of previous transactions relating to a specific proof-of-work in the past - a balance in a bitcoin wallet is just a representation of the sum of the unspent transaction outputs that have been made to that address.)
3. A transaction contains the version number (1 for now), the number of and list of inputs (as signatures), the number of and list of outputs (as encrypted public keys), and an optional lock time.
4. Theft is theft and I'm not sure why you'd think otherwise.  The problem is going to be in properly proving who owns the key in a court of law.

It's because each transaction is the receipts of past transactions, so when spending BTC you're actually spending some collection of receipts, and since each transaction receipt for each address can only be referenced by one downstream transaction, all the proceeds from that receipt have to be spent at one time.
Fiat currency works the same way, kind of.  You go to a store and want to buy something for $10 but only have a $20, you can't rip the bill and give them half, you give them the whole bill and they separate the bill into an amount to keep and an amount to return to you.

The US is not the only country that uses cents to represent 1/100th of a monetary unit.
Since centi- is the SI prefix for 1/100th, the correct terminology would be centibitcoin, which would invariable be shortened to cents anyway, like millies and mikeys are.  In that sense I think bitcent is pretty good at differentiating itself from the cent used by many other currencies.

It's two things:  
1. They're paying their accountant to do multi-currency transactions, which requires more time than recording a normal transaction.  This implies that they're holding BTC rather than converting it directly to fiat - if this is the case then they're definitely making money now.  
1. He's probably looking at that like , normally for each Reddit Gold purchase we earn $2.50 in profit, but with the extra processing from Bitcoins, those Reddit Gold's only provide $2.20 in profit, so they "lose" $0.30 on each sale in BTC, rather than actually losing money on the purchase as a whole.

Ah, welcome to the blockchain.
What you have in your wallet is a collection of private keys, that are associated with the public keys that we call addresses.  (You do know how [public-key cryptography]( works, right?)  Each address holds any number of transactions, and those transactions each represent a certain number of bitcoins - this is the blockchain, and it's always online.  However, since you need the private key to be able to access the bitcoins associated with any address, all you need to do is generate the private key offline and keep it offline, that's a paper wallet.
Since the public address isn't exposed until you send bitcoins, keeping an offline paper wallet keeps you extremely safe from attack, as neither of the addresses are publically known yet.  This is part of the reason why the bitcoin-qt client uses a new change address for each transaction.  In order to spend a paper wallet you'd import the private key or keys into a client and send the transaction, and then you'd probably want to make a new paper wallet.

The rules didn't change; there was an unexposed bug in 0.7 until the infamous early-March fork was caused by it.  The immediate but temporary solution was to keep the fork that could be read as legitimate by the greatest number of miners - since the 0.7 fork could be read by all versions, and the 0.8 fork couldn't, it was decided to use the 0.7 fork for the time being.
That said, the idea is to move forward with the protocol, so it was decided that today (a point ~2 months in the future) would mark the date that if another such a fork were caused, the 0.7 fork would be dropped and the 0.8 fork would be used instead.  It's very likely that nothing will happen today, it is just a date that was far enough away to ensure majority compliance with the upgrade (or manual override of 0.7 settings).

Your post from the 26th sums up to, "If you don't believe Bitcoin will succeed, or don't know anything about computer security, don't get involved," which is fair but is more about how little people understand about money and computers than it is about Bitcoin.
Your points, in order:  
* "Bitcoins are a horrible investment," but lots of people have made money on them.
And lots of people expect their value to grow over the long-term, this is no different than gold or beanie babies, we just don't know what will happen.  It's a fundamental uncertainty about the future, not really a criticism of Bitcoin, you know?
* "Bitcoins are only worth what people buying or selling them think they are worth," just like everything else.  
The actual worth of anything used as currency is the systems in place to convert that currency to usable goods (and also the ability to earn that currency in order to spend it, but that comes after).  We don't even have good systems in place for acquiring BTC through purchasing yet, it's still very early.
* "Keeping money safe is hard," which is why dumb people keep all their money in low-interest savings accounts.  
Again, these systems aren't in place at the level that they need to be yet for the average person.  I am hoping Coinlab/SVB will be a game changer in this regard.

I would classify all saccharides as drugs.  They are not required for survival, but they are used as a stimulant and energy source.  I fully recognize that there is no difference between refined and natural sugars in that sense.  I'm as much of a decadent urbanite as anyone else and I'm right this moment baking two cakes so I clearly don't care about my sugar intake, I just believe that it fits the criteria.
It's difficult to convey nuance in a discussion without knowing the depth of your opponent.  I respect your opinion, and I agree with you in all of it, we just have different viewpoints about what is and isn't a drug.  
The reason I use adjectives such as refined and processed (and even my selection of sucrose as a specific target) is because it allows observers to understand my point more clearly.  The alternative is being interpreted as saying things like 'fruit is bad for you' which isn't my intention.

@_date: 2013-04-28 02:52:07
Basically, when the miners solve the hash, they're looking for a hash that's equivalent to a number under a certain amount.  That amount is dictated by the difficulty of the network.
They change the hash by incrementing the nonce, which is just a string tagged onto the end of the block data, and then rehashing to get a new amount.
The thing about hashes is that while is can take a long time to find the proper one, it's very easy to verify that the hash you've been given is the correct one forth e block by hashing the block with the given nonce yourself and comparing that to the given hash.  Since each block contains the hash of the previous block, it's nearly impossible to counterfeit a block once it's been added to the blockchain.

You need to use the -datadir flag.  This is the target for the shortcut that I use: `A:\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir="f:\Blockchain Data"` edit: Also, move the contents of the %APPDATA% folder to that location first, or else your client will start over.
Bonus info: Since Armory relies on the bitcoin-qt blockchain, if you want to use it with a different location, you need to tell Armory where it is too, so you have to use the --satoshi-datadir flag, like so: `"A:\Armory Bitcoin Client\Armory.exe" --satoshi-datadir="F:\Blockchain Data"`

I'll concede your first point, I overreacted in my initial statement. I disagree that legalization of drugs would decrease the demand for bitcoin, as I *imagine* people would be more willing to transact online for such products (especially from established brands, etc.) and it wouldn't be as niche anymore. 
As to your second point: I wanted to say something like 'Are things good because God says they're good, or does God just tell us which things are good?' which I think is important, but shady isn't about right or wrong, really. I then thought I'd come up with some examples of illegal things that aren't shady, like Martha Stewart's insider trading thing, or some legal things that are shady, like multilevel marketing companies, but I don't know enough to really argue either of those points to make mine - I will point out that as laws change so does part of what's considered shady by your definition, but I don't know if that's even really relevant. 
Can we just agree that not everything illegal is necessarily shady and not everything shady is necessarily illegal? That's all I really wanted to get at.

Faucets run contrary to the concept of Bitcoin, and it's a good thing that it's harder to spend their transactions considering the load that they put on the system as a whole.
I don't understand how you can say, `I cannot buy a bitcoin at 120 a piece,`while understanding that Bitcoins are divisible, so you could buy 0.5 or 0.1 and spend $60 or $12 if you're worried about total cost and also currency.  The only reason the dollar cost of Bitcoins should matter is if you're looking to *invest* in Bitcoin as a profit-earning enterprise, in which case you should only invest in what you can afford to lose.

The mining process or proof-of-work process involves scanning for a value that when hashed with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required, but can always be verified by executing a single hash.
For the bitcoin timestamp network, it implements the mining process or "proof-of-work" by incrementing a nonce in the record or "block" until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the hashing effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later records or "blocks" are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.
The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of transaction records from the genesis block (green) to the current block or record. Orphaned records (purple) exist outside of the main chain.
The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of computing power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. The probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
Today, bitcoin mining is a competitive field. An arms race has been observed through the various hashing technologies that are used to mine bitcoins and confirm transactions: High-end GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) common in many gaming computers, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and ASICs (Application-specific integrated circuits) all have been used. The newest addition, ASICS, are built into specialized servers that can cost nearly $3000 USD a unit.
Computing power is often bundled together from various servers or "pooled" into a central server to more effectively confirm blocks of transactions. Single servers often have to wait relatively long periods of time to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment for their "work" or hashing. When resources are "pooled", all participating servers receive a proportional number of the bitcoins earned every time any one participating server resolves a block.

A wallet is a collection of private keys that correlate with some set of public keys.  Those public keys are known as addresses.
- Your client knows how many bitcoins you have by adding up the balance of all addresses that you have the private keys to~~o~~.  Other people might know that a certain address is a associated with you, but they will probably not know how many addresses you have, so they don't really know how many bitcoins you have in total.
- The value in each address is the sum of all unspent transaction outputs.  When a block is found, a transaction is created that sends new bitcoins to the address whoever mined the block.  When those bitcoins are spent, the transaction says "these bitcoins were added to this address as an output for this transaction".  Every subsequent transaction relates to the one before it, creating an unbroken sequence from the origin of each bitcoin to its current address.
- You can't use an address that you don't have the private key for, and it would take billions of years to calculate even one private key for a specific address.
- If you can get someone else's private key, then you could spend their bitcoins.  Miners verify transactions by ensuring the private key is correct and the output being referenced hasn't been used before.  I don't understand the last question.

It is absolutely essential.  It's also a checksum so that the contents of the block can be verified by verifying the hash rather than having to verify the transactions in the block.  The hash of each block is included in the next block added to the chain, that's what keeps them all in order, so to speak.

There's not a specific responsibility to either the buyer or the seller to pay the sales tax, so and i are both correct, the requirement is only that the tax must be paid.  In practice, the seller will always pass that cost onto the buyer, but the government doesn't care.  there are businesses that will do tax-free sales, but they're still responsible for paying the taxes, they just absorb the cost.
Traditionally, the system has been for sellers to collect taxes form the buyer and remit them on a regular basis, but with Bitcoin there are a lot of more useful scenarios.  I can see a government setting up a series of addresses that they control for businesses to remit taxes into directly at the point of sale (though there would have to be some sort of refund mechanism - pft, details).


In this case, who is 'you', and from my understanding the 'seller' *is* the 'person(s) holding the ...key..address' so they would only have to identify themselves.  If you're talking about the difficulty in auditing the transactions and connecting an address with an entity you are correct, for now, but either overestimating the anonymity provided by Bitcoin/the blockchain or underestimating the skill of tax auditors and accounting system analysts.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:00:45
There are going to be two documented timestamps, A) when you mailed the wallet, and B) when the funds were removed from the wallet.  There's no way to determine if the buyer has the wallet at point B, so PayPal will side with them because the seller can remove the funds at any point in time.

It depends on the structure of the pool.  Some pools, like BTCGuild, take a percentage of payouts (so say 5% of the 25+transaction fees) and payout the rest to miners.  Other pools, like Eligius, take the transaction fees as payment and only split up the 25BTC.  And others yet have no fee at all and split all earnings equally.

Gold's supply is as fixed as Bitcoin's is at the moment.  Every day, a small amount is created by the combined efforts of thousands of people working together worldwide to produce the resource.
Look, the implication of your perspective is that the value of each USD doesn't change as more are created.  You're saying that by having a currency that you can print more of, when people want more of it they can just create more.  Since printing more dollars devalues the others, there's no net gain there either - in fact there's a net dissaving to anyone who didn't happen to be a recipient of those newly printed dollars because their holdings just became less valuable.  There is no difference between an inflatable and a fixed currency supply except by the terms in which you measure the quantity of a currency, and that has nothing to do with the value of a unit of that currency.

Worked for me: 
Most people who have used the Internet for more than a few years has acted somewhat from abroad. A DVD box, books or small electronics. And paid in dollars, pounds or euros by credit card, Paypal or similar.
In the future you may want to act in a completely different way. With Bitcoin , "online currency", which was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto .
It has been called hacker currency that takes over the web . And the good opportunities to act anonymously means that it has been used for shady trades .
Price up and down
Bitcoin is not in the physical sense, but is a virtual currency based on cryptography , which has received much attention in the international press and in social media after the price has varied tremendously lately .
It was up to a value of $ 265 last Wednesday, before the price dropped to 105 The decline was probably caused by the fact that many traders panicked after a period in which many were interested and there was a delay in the system, writes Mashable . At the same time Mt.Gox, the network's "Bitcoin-trade" have been the victim of a hacker attack .
Mashable notes that Mt.Gox and the other players must avoid such situations ahead if your currency will have a future. Online dealers must be able to trust that the currency is relatively stable.
There is no Bitcoin central bank and it has been argued that the banking industry and their advisors, are skeptical of the first and foremost because they are not themselves part of any Bitcoin value chains. But that could change. Western Union and MoneyGram should be starting to look at the possibility that they will be able to sell the currency.
- If Bitcoins continue to grow and currency are defined more international, so will look look for opportunities to use it to pay for us, says David Thompson, Head of Western Union, according to Fox Business .
A network of Bitcoin supporters have set out to repel what they consider a number of myths related to the currency, among other things, that the whole thing is a huge pyramid scheme .
Big money
But it is obvious that anyone can earn big money (or Bitcoins, then) on the program . Those who got in earlier, when one Bitcoin equivalent to $ 1, has experienced a sharp increase in value. 1 Bitcoin equivalent today about 620 million, according Coinmill . Some driver what is referred to as "digging" or "mining" for Bitcoins .
Sigvald Sveinbjørnsson, editor of digi.no, described the digging process so earlier this week :
"He actually recovered. Almost like gold. The algorithm underlying the generation of Bitcoins generates a given party six times every hour. Anyone can participate in recovery, or Mining, by the processing power available. "

No, either you have the private key or you don't, there's no way to make a read-only address without becoming unable to ever send the coins.  Casacius coins avoid this my hiding the private key, so as long as the seal hasn't been tampered with, you can trust that the Bitcoins it represents still exist.


You've already realised the problem with having it verifiable via QR code, there could be many such codes on bills pointing to the same address.


Why?  People will use paper money when it's not convenient to use Bitcoin, like how we use cash when we can't use debit/credit nowadays.
edit: I don't really trust physical notes.  Imagine that there were 50BTC coins, like the Casascius ones, that instead of having loaded 50BTC into an address to put on the coin, they just recycled one of the original mining addresses that has the one 50BTC block creation transaction and put that public address on the key.  You can check it, but you can't ever really spend it.  I mean, sure, you might notice that the one transaction is from 2010, but would you?

A watch-only wallet is literally just a collection of addresses that your wallet application is tracking the balance of and listening for transactions.

The government doesn't care *who* pays the tax, as long as the correct amount of tax has been paid for each transaction that they know about and/or care to track.






Like I said, it's all exactly the same as it has been.  Legitimate businesses are required to remit sales taxes that match with their revenues which match with their financial statements and it's hard to convincingly lie about it, Bitcoin or not.  The person who can be most easily identified is the person who is paying taxes on a regular basis, you know?
I highly doubt that we'll ever be in a situation where "*every* transaction is constructed like" an arms-length third party transaction while we're still worried about things like sales tax.

For getting them, seems to me the best way right now is to go through LibertyBit to buy them though sometimes you have to wait for a good opportunity to buy (or you can buy them from me if you're in Toronto).  There's also localbitcoins, cavirtex, and canadianbitcoins to check out for other prices/methods.
For storing them, I would use completely offline paper wallets for ling-term storage, one of the desktop clients like Armory or Bitcoin-QT for short-term holdings, and then maybe an online wallet for half a coin or something so it's always available if you're feeling so inclined.

Hey, this is cool, you guys added me on Twitter this afternoon.
I think implementing micropayments for internet usage would be a great market for bitcoins and your company.  On the [contracts page]( in the wiki, Example 7 describes exactly how such a system could be implemented in the blockchain.  I also think the scenario laid out in Example 3 could be an interesting way to raise funds to create more public wifi hotspots.
I'm currently messing around with Entangled (a python-based Kademlia implementation with a shared tuple space) just to understand p2p software better.  Does Open Garden use a protocol similar to that, or is it something else entirely?

I don't think you really understand what a Bitcoin is, anyway.  Bitcoins are *always* stored in the blockchain, and all you keep on your computer are the private keys, so all you have to do is have the private keys to the addresses that you want to use on you, and you can use any client or service to access them at any time from anywhere connected to the Internet.  If you sent all of your bitcoins to a single address and memorized that private key, you could wake up naked in China and still be able to access your bitcoins.

It seems that e-gold was shut down because they were a centralized exchange of wealth that wasn't properly following regulations about "Knowing Your Customer" and subsequently charged with money laundering.  This is a problem with exchanges, not a problem with Bitcoin.
Can you point me to specific laws about money exchanges/banking that deals with the Bitcoin protocol itself and not, say, the functions of a bank or exchange?  There are no laws that I know of that restrict the creation of a currency just on the basis of it being a new currency, or the creation of a medium of exchange, and that's all that Bitcoin is.

The problem isn't in being able to view the open orders, the issue is that there are potentially people ahead of you in queue to buy those orders, so you see 1BTC for $90, and place a market order for 1BTC, but the people in front of you in the queue cumulatively bought 1000BTC raising the price to $97 between the time when your order is accepted and when your order is executed.  Then when your market order executes, you end up paying $7 more than you intended.
This is why most people avoid market orders for buying.

The only reason this would be an issue for an employer with computerized payroll is that both employer and employee require a bank account in the proper currency to be paid, but since Bitcoin payments would have to be separate from the traditional banking system anyway it wouldn't really be an issue.  You would just create a new code for Manual BTC Payments and reduce their pay to their bank account by the appropriate percentage.  All the taxes are taken out ahead of time, so it's literally just splitting the net amount paid into different pools.
In Canada and you'll find lots of people in border towns who have USD bank accounts and get some percent of their pay in USD to avoid exchange costs for both them and their employer.

I think that milli- and micro- are popular because the average Bitcoin user is a techy person for now, but they aren't official terms (neither is 'satoshi' as a unit), and whatever ends up being used by people will be the de facto standard anyway.
Regardless of whether people are understanding of the system or just memorise a few units, as you say, the outcome will be the same.  Can you suggest a better schema?

I am clearly NAL, but I would argue that Bitcoin miners generally don't qualify as money transmitters because I would interpret `a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person` to be related to the incrementation of a balance, not the transference of access data.  That is, the miner is the recipient of transactional data that allows for the transference of control of bitcoins, and not the creator nor the holder of the bitcoins.  The act of creation of the bitcoins is not related to the acts of any one miner but the mining group as a whole and removing one element theoretically wouldn't change the speed at which bitcoins are generated.

Companies generally will be divesting a major portion of their Bitcoins immediately to cover costs, which will put downward pressure on the price, and more people would be interested in buying them to use them at those store would put upward pressure on the price.  Since those two movements would happen in roughly equal measure it would have a net effect of stabilizing the price by increasing the depth.
So yes.
But, having thought about this more, there are two things to keep in mind:
1. Buying pressure will always outpace selling pressure during periods of adoption.  This is self-evident in that people have to buy bitcoins and spend them before businesses can sell them.  There will be some "old money" not using Bitcoins bought within the relevant period, but the majority of people don't have *any* yet, so that's a minor effect for now,
2. The total value of the Bitcoin market will have to be large enough to support the volume and value of the transactions that are going on within it (which I think is also self-evident), but what that size is ultimately depends on adoption and the speed of transacting, but the value that it will have to reach is unknown
   * What's really interesting about this to me is that the end value is going to depend a lot on the speed at which these systems work.  Someone could pay for a coffee at Starbucks with a mBTC, which is processed and sold instantly on a market, filling a buy order [This already happens].  The cool part is when you consider that the person behind the guy buying the coffee might be the one with the open buy order, and now they're potentially paying for their coffee with the same mBTC the previous patron did (or, rather, the input of their purchase might be tied directly to the output of the previous patron's transaction, just by chance).

Almost. You gave to pay taxes on any realised gains. By buying something with Bitcoin (or anything, really) for which you paid less than what value you're receiving in trade you're realising gains, even without conversion to USD, and you should record, report, and pay the appropriate taxes.

I read it a couple of times in the past but I read it again after learning about Bitcoin and the difference is that now there's a real world currency mechanism that could mimic the commodities trading systems that are core to the microstate framework.

I personally think this is a bad idea.  
1. The 'judging via network' concept doesn't work in reality because the facts can be easily skewed or misinterpreted.
2. You're basically asking people to rat out their friends/family, for situations that, again, are going to be interpreted through a biased lens.
3. There's no reason to trust the trust network, other than because they say they're trustworthy, and it does nothing to prevent people from being scammed the first time.
4. People don't want their personal information on the Internet.  In this case, there's a chance that someone could be falsely accused of committing fraud and have their information shared publicly, which is way out of my comfort zone.
Furthermore, Bitcoin is supposed to be based on the principle of not needing to rely on trust at all, so I'd like to see systems designed with that concept in mind instead of trying to skirt it allow the same level of complacency as our current banking systems let us get away with.  What we really need is a third party that participates as escrow for secure face-to-face transactions - something not unlike like a pawn shop.

The best way to do this is to have cash in an exchange ahead of time, and then show then the process of making the purchase, and you can send them the actual bitcoins that you just bought when they give you the cash.  I think doing it this way helps people get over the mystique of trading on an exchange.

The buyer is responsible for paying sales taxes, though it's typically the responsibility of the seller to collect and remit it to the relevant governing body.
Taxation is (usually) computed as a percentage of the value being exchanged at the time of the transaction, and applies to all governed transactions, regardless of the method of payment.
In your other replies you seem to think that the government is going to go after everyone who transacts with Bitcoin, and they won't.  They don't care if you don't pay taxes on selling a trinket to your friend, they care about commercial tax evasion/non-compliance and retail sales revenue.
Again, this is no different than how taxation currently works on any transaction paid in any currency or through barter.

Bitcoins aren't stored anywhere, you could import the same private key on 100 different programs and they'd all report the balance in there as being the same until it was spent.  Change addresses from bitcoin-qt are the answer.
If you go into the debug console and do `exportprivkey 1TheChangeAddressForYourTransaction`and it should give you the private key, which you can import into blockchain.info. You may have to decrypt your wallet first.

Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. The inputs are outputs of previous transactions and have finite sizes. Transactions combine all inputs and then separate them into multiple outputs, like melting down gold coins into new sizes. The portion you get back is your change and is paid to change addresses.
For example, someone pays you 1.0 XBT in one transaction and you want to spend 0.35 of it, the transaction created pays 0.35 to them and 0.65 to a change address for you.
My understanding of your transaction is that you sent your 9+ coins from Campbx to Armory, and CampBX used multiple inputs totalling more than the amount that you transferred to send you that amount, and then sent the excess back to one of their own change addresses.

You can do it on most exchanges, I have used MtGox and LibertyBit both to place limit orders.  
Basically, you put a bid into the market for say 1BTC @ $80, even though the current price is ~$135, and it just sits there on the market until someone makes an ask or market sell that is at or below $80/BTC, which could happen due to a slow decline in value or a sudden crash or whatever.

If he's not a Canadian citizen, and he's making a purchase from outside Canada, he's not liable to pay taxes **that are payable to Revenue Canada, or any other Canadaian entity** on anything except shipping supplies and costs if they're paid by him (as they're consumed in Canada by the shipper).  Every tax on the item before his purchase is not his concern as they aren't paid by him, there's no sales tax on non-citizens, and every tax on the item after his purchase (VAT, import, etc.) does not get paid to Canada.

Banks are freezing accounts because of regulations regarding suspicious money transfers.  That's not the same as money laundering laws - if it was money laundering laws we'd have seen the exchange owners arrested as well.
There are also banks that aren't freezing exchange bank accounts, so there's clearly not a legal issue directly related to running a Bitcoin exchange, but rather there were issues in communication between the exchanges who've had their accounts closed and their banks.
