Anyone posting this stuff wants you to spend your own money to prop up his investment. Saying that puts me into serious “no shit” territory, but such posts leave a bad taste in my mouth, even when positioned as a joke

It would go up.  With everyone believing in it.  It's always a good sign when the price of something is dependent on everyone believing in it

deflationary currencies don't encourage spending.  If Bitcoin goes to the moon like HODLers want, who the hell is going to spend it to buy things? It's a waste when it could be worth more the next day.  Think of people who used Bitcoin to buy pizza back in the day, and what it'd be worth if they'd held onto it instead.  
You can have a currency, or an investment.  It's pretty hard for it to be both.  It can't become a currency unless it stops massively increasing in value and settles into something like stability
I could be wrong of course I'm just some guy on the internet with no qualifications

You must be joking.  There have been little upticks all day, but the trend is down.  Did it go up for a while?  Give it an hour.
I of course have the benefit of posting this 24 minutes later and knowing it's right back down.  But sure, you called the rebound!  I bet you'll be just as right at 8-8.2

now that it's dropped again, from the thread:
Bitmex was the whale that bought there. They were going to lose $100k if OP closed out his trade for a win. But combined with other shorts, there was $1 million in short trades they were losing.
So they spent $1 million and bought BTC to drive the price up 3%. Wasn't hard since there wasn't much selling pressure left
since the exchanges are all connected through arbitrage, and many bots will buy on sudden spikes, he gets help from others.
There's no reason to margin trade. The game is stacked in every way against you, no matter how small an amount you're using.
loool bitmex cashed out their BTC.
maybe a 10% loss max on their BTC buy, but made $1 million on liquidating noobs
