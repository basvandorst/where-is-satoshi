It will be power enough. Just be careful of backups. You are now on old hard disks that can die. Even USB sticks can die or get lost or damaged. But if you are just asking "is it powerful the answer is yes. It will just take a long time to boot up the wallet. (Not the operating system. The wallet itself. Start it and go have lunch.

Everyone's being funny because the question doesn't make sense. 
"protocols" are simply "how we do things" or "how we exchange things" there is no place the "web" keeps it's "protocols".
If you're asking the question as in "where are the rules on how the programs talk to each other, or exchange things". The official answer is in the github.com/bitcom/bitcom repository.
But that's the answer a developer would  need  to know to  build new bitcoin related software.
Perhaps you can ask your quesiton again without trying to use technical words because you seem to want to know a specific question about maybe how bitcoin works, or how the programs that use the bitcoin technology do what they do.

In bitcoin there is only one thing. The PRIVATE KEY. That's it. the public key is derived from the private key and all other tools help you CREATE a public key.
if someone gets access to your private key they can spend your money.
If you have a thumb drive with  your private key it may not necessarily be in the open. it was be "encrypted" but if it's encrypted with a word it will take little time for the right program to crack it.

Simple one. I take a low powered node with a nice 5GHz miner. I leave for north Korea with no internet. In our big red cross network we make 100 transactions. When we return our node realizes it was a forked off chain. Gives up control to the blocks the true network.
Our "confirmed" transactions now roll back to pending and the real block chain finally confirm them because we never made any transactions on the real network.
1) Do the clients reconfirm without our little node? Or does the node need to comunicate that it was a forked node and has given up to the real blockchain.
2) can I change the difficulty manually since I know my little node will never get the true next node in this mini "silent" network where he's the only node (knowing full well he's a forked node and his transactions will be rolled back as invalid ones when the clients re-join the "real" bitcoij network.

Confirmation is instant. You get the coins within seconds. Its up to you to wait 10 minutes or 10 days outside making really really sure a physical ATM a physical location with a sign a lease and someone to sue, not to double spend the transactions the same second yours just got sent from.

Think about what a "regular person" would do with bitcoin and what someone in your own definition's of a "dark market" would need bitcoin for.
Look at the number of transactions per day:
Since there are not a lot. then I feel safe in saying it's more of an "investment" Since "regular person's" are the ones that "invest" and "dark market's" would want to move money as quickly as possible I'd guess that the majority of bitcoin is used by "regular persons"
Plus think how EASY it is for anyone to use cash for criminal activities compared to say a currency where everyone can see your activity.

The price of bitcoin does not depend on one thing. It's truly the price people BELIEVE it is. so any little thing can change it. and remember no "BIG WHALE" every has enough to control it. it's not the fact that someone with 5% of the stake that "sells off" that moves the market. It's the MARKET that moves the market.

Unfortunately realistically the number is zero. It is also zero after 10 years. The basic answer is to think of this not like how much sand would an ant move compared to an elephant (it would move a little but eventually have a decent amount of sand.... Eventually).
Bitcoin mining is NOT like that. Instead think more like a loto ticket pool at work. You have 1 ticket you play and there can be only one winner. Everyone else has.... 10 trillion tickets and they play very 10minutes and they let you play once a year.

In iOS it's called "URL Schemes" similar than how you can have your app pop open the facebook app. Using the Bitcoin URI described by  you'd simple show the user the QR code or address to copy (just in case they want to choose a service outside their phone or on a website like blockchain.info BUT you'd also have a link that simple opens one of their bitcoin apps on their phone.
Here's how (to do regular URL Schemes for any app)

To understand that the 10confirmation isn't needed you have to understand how it works.
The "transaction" doesn't become permanent until its officially written that will happen probably in the next 10minutes. This is true. But the buyer has broadcast his transaction and the network received it in seconds if not a minute or two.
The only possibility would be a very sophisticated message trying to race against this transaction hoping to beat yours.
With zero third party solutions you can already use several wallets out there that simply listen constantly to transactions at big nodes. Once they see them there. You're pretty sure your transaction will win.
So just like when I go on my android wallet and send you money and you see the "start of the confirmation" right away you can almost be sure that its going to be everywhere else soon.
So. If you're accepting payment for a coffee a sandwitch or a steak dinner then a couple of seconds should be fine.
If you are buying a car (as I did this weekend. Shameless plug) then you should wait the fulk hour and he "6 confirmations". Its going to take 4 to buy that car anyways.

Meetup groups are another way to buy bitcoins.
Coin base is slow but it works.
Look in coinmap.org for any ATM around your family.

You will solve this. Patience is the answer

Excellent post. But I think you forget also the value of their network. I think “mining” is their soggy worm at the end of their fishing line. It’s not the “thing” they’re selling. and the OS is just an easy path to their “NETWORK”
Essentially you’re buying a path to their network for ” an entrepreneur or developer, you can now instantly buy or sell digital goods and services at the command line using Bitcoin.”
THAT is their business. and THAT is what they’re charging you $151.56 for.
I think you’ll find that the “Bitcoin computer” eventually goes away and so does the OS and only their network of quick BUY AND SELL remains.
I’m in. But like you said. I’ll save the $150+ and just register for an API.
Thanks for a great post!

The miner isn't the "thing". You are not going to mine with this software. And if you don't believe me. go back to their website. Click Ctrl F and type "mine" and prove me where they mention it. (except in that little image) they don't. and that is ONE of the MANY things they're showing.

If by fiat you mean "money in transfer" and not the physical cash they had in their accounts... Then think of it more like you asking "would the accounts starting with 1 be first"
All accounts will probably be treated the same. regardless of the status of the account. Because many had "cash out" as in asked mt.gox to send their payments to their bank accounts And were waiting for months.
No bank takes months. So the "pending" of your transfer was a choice that mt.gox made. Meaning the money on your "waiting transfer" were as deserving as those that thought they didn't have to move the money

Side chains simply put a particular value on certain bitcoins (each had a serial if you wish to think about it)
Now just like pretending a small  set of 20 American dollars represent a 20,000 apple shares and whom ever has any one of those dollars holds 1,000 shares.
The only difference is that each is a very small denomination of Bitcoin. 
Each transaction is done also in the Blockchain by trading these tiny amount of specific bitcoins and hence the transaction is recorded.
The side chains can also be transacted off the bitcoin transactions and then synced later but the idea is that each portion of the side chain is represented in bitcoin and ownership can be proven by the corresponding bitcoin ownership or bitcoin transactions.

The fees are the same as the "reward of 25 bitcoins.
If you don't win the mining lottery you also don't win the fees.
In otherwords if you're saying (I don't need those 25bitcoins if I can get enough fees) remember they go together.
Even if the fees go up 100X you still make them only if you find the blockchain.

It also goes like this:
"Bitcoin is a commodity. But unlike gold there's nothing behind it of value. so it could go down to zero. or also grown to infinity (for the same reason)"
What people forget to tell you (when they'll come up with that exuse) will be that gold ALSO has no reason stay above a cent and COULD go down to zero.

No it doesn't. Read the details. You essentially buy a prepaid credit card with the total you put in. So if you have $500CDN in there today and Bitcoin doubles a week later you still have $500. If it was the way you say you would have $1000
