Anything associated with that clown from BFL is automatically off limits. I don't need the trouble.

Doing an image search with tineye.com shows the image was on BFL's website on this page:
but is currently unavailable.

Why are people downvoting this? Oh yeah, I guess Josh is at home awaiting his fate.

It doesn't need to be compiled. It's python. Just download it and run it. Worst case, you are missing some dependencies which need to be downloaded separately.

There's nothing insecure about it if you use it the way it was intended - 1. Load up the site.  2. Disconnect from the internet.  3. Reload or regenerate a key while disconnected from the internet.  4. Record or print out keys. 5. Win?

If you are on linux (and you'd better be if you want to be safe), do the following:
**cd ~/.bitcoin**
**gpg -c -a wallet.dat**
When prompted, type in a nice long passphrase that you mustn't forget. The "-c" means use conventional encryption and not Public/Private keypairs, "-a" means use ascii armor which makes it easy to email the backup if you want to. 
Now copy the resulting wallet.dat.asc file to Google docs, Dropbox, send it to your sister, etc. It is encrypted with your passphrase so it's safe to upload to the cloud. 
If gpg isn't available on your machine, you can use openssl:
**openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in wallet.dat -out wallet.dat.enc**

Bitcoins are converted to dollars immediately upon ordering. There is no benefit to canceling because of the bitcoin price.

I miss the old Snapcard. I used them a lot to buy stuff on non-mainstream websites (mostly electronics). 
Their biggest problem was the code was badly written and didn't work with a lot of websites and often required human intervention.  Anytime humans are involved it costs Snapcard money.

This is a mistake (in my opinion).  Give the lawyer the a passphrase to BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets, but not the wallets themselves.  Give your family the paper wallets. Then they have to work together to rob you. (or vice-versa, give the lawyer the wallets and tell your family the passphrase).

Running btcguild is eleuthria's full time job, so support is excellent. I've been on some pools where you ask a question and it takes days or weeks to get an answer. Uptime is also an issue. It only takes a couple of hours of downtime to undo any savings you made on fees.

So this is for five identical wallets? Not five wallets with different addresses?

It would be interesting if the people he was getting his chips from are the ones that took over the business. Conflict of interest?

Take the metal end-plates off. It becomes much quieter after that. You'll need torx screwdrivers.

My wife sent 100 USD for a walmart gift card and nothing is showing up in her wallet.  
Transaction is confirmed. 
Edit - finally got it after about two hours. (Well after it was confirmed).

* The number of TOR exit nodes is limited. So eventually, you're going to run out of options. \
* This is incredibly sleazy. These coins are to get people started, not to be abused by some snotty nosed dirtbag.

Anyone know where to get those USB fans?

I suspect it took so long because you are doing some kind of manual review...am I right?  I wouldn't mind this at all if you had disclosed up front how long it would take. My expectation was that:
1. As soon as I made the transaction - I would see something pending in my wallet - the reality - NOTHING. No indication of a purchase.  From my point of view, I just sent money down a deep hole. 
2. No later than when the transaction was confirmed, the card should have shown up in the wallet - the reality - it took more than two hours. 
1. Explain up front what to expect. 
2. Show the status of the pending purchase, not a blank screen.

Here's an idea - make a deal with the seller to pay for an OPTION to buy the house. Essentially, pay him several hundred each month to hold the house for you until your bank is ready. If you back out, he keeps the money.

If they let you buy directly from the app, they have to give Apple 30 percent of the sale.

In Two Weeks ™, Butterfly Labs will come out with a new wallet product.

It's not an emotional decision. For those of us that ordered from BFL (Butterfly Labs), are choices are limited since they won't allow us to cancel the order. 
Our choices are:
1. Get the device late and mine with it, even knowing it will never pay for itself. 
2.  Sell the device to someone else to try to recover the money we paid, in which case, that device still goes on the network and adds to the hash rate. 
So in both of these cases, overall hash rate is increased along with the difficulty.

You'll shoot your eye out. 
Seriously, my son started small, mining with a video card. I then got him a Jalepeno for Christmas (delivered 9 months late by the fucking BFL Scrooge). Now, he has more money than most kids his age and we don't even pay him allowance anymore because it would be a joke compared to his BTC earnings.
