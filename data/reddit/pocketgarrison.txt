Never knew there was an 11 cent transfer fee, this bot must be making bank. There should just be a way to link an address to your account and people can send it directly. Anyways, expect a 20 cent tip in the future when i get enough from surveys and stuff.

That is very kind of you however someone else already tipped me $0.2, the problem is i don't know how to accept it :/
Ill ask them, but i just wanna say thanks again for the offer.

Thank you, I like how its real time to show me changes, im probably still going to use  for now just becuase it gives the option to type in amounts.

My tip says cancelled, is it something i did wrong or did you decline it, i had $0.40 so i gave 20 cents to you and 20 to someone else who helped. did some sort of service charge make me go over?
Edit: Ya i just checked and i only have 9 cents left after the other guys tip went trough before yours i guess. But once i get enough ill send it to you :D

I saw a video about that but i dont really care that much about safety as i only have 1 dollar in total right now, i just want a good base to build off of.

Thank you very much :D
This is defiantly an experience, me being relatively new to something like this and my mindset changing from thinking BTC's are a toy currency to seeing them as something like CAD and USD.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:06:09
So i just transferred funds to myself, and i got charged 10 cents :/ not cool, i was at 99, and i was hoping the change in prices would bring it to a dollar.... lame

Well then thank you very much, i appreciate all the help you have given me. One day my tiny 9 cents will grow to 100 cents, can you believe that, a whole dollar. 
Have a good one.

Ok, you seem to know what your talking about so i have a question.
I just transfered all my BTC (a total of one whopping dollar) to blockchain and i got a file called my paper wallet (a pdf), and another one called wallet.aes.json what are these?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:36:14
ok i think i figured it out, so the bitcointip thing makes an address and recognizes it to be mine (pocketgarrison) then i can tell it to send that to wherever i want? i.e. my a address on coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:25:48
I have seen that bitcointip thing before and from some quick its just a way to transfer bitcoins over reddit, problem is i dont know how to accept them, any advice? And should i say btc instead of bitcoin or is that not how to use it?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:26:14
Will do.
Just checked it out, holy that's a big wall of text, it'll take some time.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:37:51
Thank you very much, i think i understand how the bot works now i wrote it in another reply somewhere here, now time to have some fun with my btc :D
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:03:21
Yup, just wanted to return the money, i only needed a bit to see how everything works. Thanks a bunch for letting me borrow it :D
