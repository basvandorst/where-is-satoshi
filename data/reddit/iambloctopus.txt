Careful. If this doesn't link to trezor.com it's a scam.

Nice. Was reading this on my phone, guess I missed it. Thanks for putting this together!

Sounds right. Every Bitcoin atm I have used guides the customer through the process step by step. A Bitcoin wallet and cash should be all you need.

Its the symbol for the official currency of Thailand; bitcoiners hijacked it.

I never get tired of seeing how excited people get when they first learn about Bitcoin! Everybody go out and make videos.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:35:21
Depends on the definition of currency you choose to use. Guess the one I use is different from yours ;)

Only lesson I learned from this is to not be a scumbag dirt piece of shite!

Yeah, he's so silly. PayPal has only hired several shakers and movers from the Bitcoin industry, integrated Bitcoin into their services, and let's not forget last years PayPal commercial  But hey, what do I know!

Get ready to hear from PayPal that the buyer is claiming they never made the purchase. Probably a hacked account. Sorry to hear about the bad luck.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:18:20
Yup, paid a transaction fee. I used it for 4 transactions the same day...the first three went through lickety-split, the last one, 3 days???
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:47:14
I definitely agree that after the next halving there will be a dramatic increase in interest and hopefully price.

Apple has temporarily removed Mycelium from the app store
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:49:39
You have a solid point. I think the smartest move for a company now is to not corner themselves into bitcoin, but rather focus on cryptocurrency users, privacy advocates, blockchain projects, and all around tech enthusiasts.
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:29:32
We're not making a great deal of profit on the tshirts and $24.99 is actually par for the course. Unlike other companies making bitcoin tshirts we are using premium garments and screenprinting methods; we don't want to sacrifice quality for quantity. Ordering in multiples of 100+, the blank t-shirts alone cost us $10. Then you have to factor in design work, packaging materials, cost of screenprinting (screens, inks and labor,) hosting a shopify website, freebies that are included, etc. Of course we can always use cheap tshirts and an inferior method of printing direct to garment; its definitely an option. This is one reason I created this post, if people are looking for cheaper options we can make that happen. The tradeoff is that the shirts won't be as comfortable and the designs will fade after 2 or 3 times in the washer.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:17:21
Yup, had an account.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:47:59
Thanks for the feedback. Definitely check back, we are taking a more streamlined, typeface approach for our next designs. There will be more to come!
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:57:47
There's still always that 1% :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:18:17
90 minutes is beans, I just waited 72 hours for a transaction to confirm using a very popular wallet who shall remain unnamed. I will say that a few hours is not uncommon at all for coinbase, and much more tolerable than 3 days!
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:25:32
Good point eazyg. We'll have to figure out a way to make our quality apparent to first time visitors.
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:05:38
lol. Sorry, I can't think of any. I keep all of my bitcoin, I don't convert a single satoshi; oh yeah and my screenprinter accepts bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:41:57
Based on the previous post and two private messages we have temporarily lowered our price to $19.99. We're also looking for a cheaper printing alternative which won't require our sacrificing quality. More feedback would be greatly appreciated. We're printing these tshirts so as to spark non-invasive conversations about cryptocurrencies which will aid in educating people about how bitcoin works. Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:50:14
Nothing better than free promotion right!
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:37:05
Absolutely, tshirts is what I'm doing right now. I'm just trying to feel out the community and really just get some feedback. I have one design and am currently working on two more. The shirts sold well at Atlanta's Bitcoin Consumer Fair yesterday and they are starting to garner interest. I would appreciate feedback on the designs. Thanks, you can check us out at 
@_date: 2015-04-21 02:12:27
Thanks for asking. For this design we won't be doing red, at least not for now. I am however considering a dark red for our next design which is being worked on at the moment. Please feel free to check our website occasionally.
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:50:24
Thanks for your feedback, I think you're pretty right on; that's where we're going with our next tshirt. I will have to look at the newsletter subscription again, thanks for mentioning that.
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:51:47
Then buy your bitcoin tshirts at Bloctopus.com. We accept bitcoin on our site and we'll even accept ether if you contact us directly! We may not have the selection they have but our quality is top tier, you will be very happy with your purchase.
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:55:05
lol. But seriously, you wouldn't believe how many mediums I sell (most popular size.) You must be talking about American bitcoiners; people in Europe are either much smaller or they don't drink diet Cokes all day long!
@_date: 2015-09-25 07:48:35

My wife loves how this smells; I hear Honest Amish is pretty good too.
@_date: 2016-05-22 19:42:53
Interesting.I've talked with several other Mac users who have experienced this issue...when I was in the Slack there were other people trying to trouble shoot this problem as well.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:25:26
Ummm yes...that is correct, and they are on sale for Bitcoin Black Friday. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:58:47
My wife didn't realize I already posted on r/bitcoin and posted this morning. Since I've been accused of spamming I think I'll just leave it tho. And the good news is I still have 6 more tentacles and a wife who is actually cool with bitcoin. I consider myself a pretty lucky bloctopus.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:21:58
If that scares you than bitcoin isn't for you. Bitcoin is probably the most volatile investment you can make. The only reason its "doing what it's doing" is because it is revolutionizing finance. You buy today, it may be worth substantially less in two months or two hours. Yesterday btc was 318, today it hit 370, tomorrow could be 260. If bitcoin doesn't revolutionize anything than a sudden collapse is inevitable.
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:08:03
Works for me.
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:06:20
Pffftttt...no way will they demonize DPR. One theme that most of the Cohen Brothers films share is that of the underdog beating the odds. You should watch a few of their flicks! Start with "the big lebowski" and "raising Arizona"
@_date: 2016-05-22 16:15:22
Nope. Tried that...still having the same issue.
@_date: 2016-05-09 22:12:09
lol, he's just a "wannabee" vj.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:08:33
My advice is this. If you believe that bitcoin will revolutionize the finance industry, buy and hold. If you don't believe it will revolutionize anything, stay away. And if you aren't sure about either, you have a lot more research to do. 
You can start at bitcoin.org. You can also join the bitcoin community at zapchain.com. Zapchain is full of bitcoin entrepeneurs and professionals. Not only can you get your questions answered there, but you can also earn your first satoshis(smallest units of bitcoin) for answering questions and being involved in the community.
Don't ever invest in anything without doing your due diligence. BTW...reddit is not the best place to get advice about anything really!
Oh, and one more thing...if you are in a larger city you can check meetup.com for local bitcoin groups. I co-organize the Atlanta Bitcoin meetup and we have 500 members; you can get an answer to just about anything if you can get to a meetup.
@_date: 2016-05-22 15:09:36
I haven't but it seems to be a common problem for Mac users. I've been posting in slack but the only fix involved me using command line, and I'm not that technically proficient. Most of the items I see for sale say NaN for price, when I try to complete the purchase I get an error message "The vendor's server has rejected the purchase request. This may be due to a connection issue. Check your purchase data, such as quantity and Bitcoin refund address, to make sure it is valid. If it is valid, try again in a few seconds.  Reason: float division by zero"
It's odd because I have no problem on the sellers side, and have completed 20+ transactions
Where can I file an issue?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:59:37
I am excited to see what the future brings for Blocknet, bitnation, and horizon.
@_date: 2015-11-30 03:16:55
We still have our bitcoin tshirts discounted to $17.99 at bloctopus.com
@_date: 2016-05-26 22:14:26
You could try a junkyard. Dig up all of the old computers and look for hard drives with Bitcoin wallets on them. Shouldn't take more than a few decades. If you're lucky you'll find one with at least one Bitcoin, and by then it may be worth a million bucks!
@_date: 2015-11-28 05:19:18
Okie dokie. Thanks for looking.
@_date: 2016-05-22 12:14:37
I've sold a bunch but unfortunately haven't been able to buy anything. There is a bug where many if not all Mac OS users cannot complete purchases. My only purchases had to be done off OB and in their Slack. I hope this bug is resolved soon, it's pretty major IMO.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:18:07
Do not do this, get a hardware wallet; ledger or trezor 
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:59:29
I wouldn't trust it with a large sum of bitcoin, but that's just me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:45:36
I would say many major bugs still.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:14:19
Buckle up...you ain't seen nothing yet!
