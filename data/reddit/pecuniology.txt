One problem with quasi-libertarian political solutions is that they can be reversed after the next election. The only way for a political libertarian to ensure that tyranny never regain power would be for him or her to hold onto it permanently, tyrannically even.
Whether these are 'better' is a matter of subjective taste, but *alternatives* to being coopted by the political process are mockery—It is hard to tyrannize a mass of individuals who are laughing openly at you—and commercial success.

Finance professor here. 
Prices can be driven up for any of three different reasons:
1) Increase in the money supply faster than the growth rate of the economy based on that money.
2) Increase in Aggregate Demand.
3) Decrease in Aggregate Supply.
* Number 1 is off-the-charts, what the *what-what*, as illustrated above. 
* Related to Number 2, Aggregate Demand in the USA is *wayyy* down from where it used to be. People are driving cars longer than they used to, young people tend not to get credit cards the way we did back when popular music didn't suck [I'll probably get a downvote for that], real wages continue their 40-year downward slide, underemployment is endemic due largely to automation, and on and on.
* Related to Number 3, Aggregate Supply is up, due largely to automation and improvements in technology.
So, while the &lt;voice value="Dr. Evil"&gt; $14 ***trill****ion*&lt;/voice&gt; new dollars—that Greenspan, Bernanke &amp; Co. dumped into the global economy through Quantitative Inflation—pushes up, the other two push down.
My greatest fear is that you youngsters, or your younger siblings, will go and get all optimistic and start borrowing money to buy stuff again, thereby driving up Aggregate Demand. Then, things could get dicey.

Banks are commercial firms, and not charities, that have been deputized against their executives' wills.  They comprise the most highly regulated industry in the world that is subject to local ordinances, regional and national statutes, *and* international treaties.
Now that depositors are keeping most of their money in investment portfolios, commercial banks no longer earn most of their income from the difference between what they pay to depositors and what they receive from borrowers. They are forced to focus more on anything that they can charge a fee for.
As an industry, banks have a near-absolute monopoly on the lives of residents of [OECD member states](  Although, intriguingly, the vast majority of residents of countries that are not OECD members do *not* have bank accounts, much to the great consternation of bank executives worldwide.
It is disingenuous to tell someone, "If you don't like banks, then don't use them," when it means the difference between receiving one's salary and paying one's bills with relative ease and having to use all sorts of inefficient work-arounds.

Whether this means dealing only with clients who will pay you with Bitcoin, partnering with some friends to start a bill-payment co-op, or whatever is up to each individual, but there is an opportunity lurking within every unnecessary cost.

The concept of "intrinsic value" is closely related to the Labor Theory of Value that was embraced by Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and other Classical economists. The belief before the 1870s was that a thing's value was a direct function of how much effort it took to produce it.
Setting aside the Marginal Theory of Value that underlies all modern economic theory, except for some few crackpots and Marxists, the idea that producing new bitcoins is not extremely costly is ludicrous.
On the one hand, if one accepts the Marginal Theory of Value—i.e., that Supply-&amp;-Demand thing that you had to learn as an undergraduate—then 'intrinsic value' is void conceptually.
On the other hand, if one accepts the Labor Theory of Value, then bitcoins have massive intrinsic value.

Price changes can be driven by any of three general factors: changes in consumer demand, changes in producer supply, changes in the money supply.
Quantitative Easing—i.e., *inflation*—in the USA has been unprecedented over the past five years.
This puts **upward** pressure on prices.
However, at the same time:
* Consumer demand in the USA has fallen, as people scale back out of fear of repeats of the Crash of 2008 that included the largest bankruptcy in all of human history that did not involve the collapse of an empire or even a nation-state. This puts **downward** pressure on prices.
* Producer supply in the USA is increasingly automated, which reduces the costs of production. This puts **downward** pressure on prices.
The time to fear sharp increases in prices is when consumers start feeling more optimistic about the future and go shopping again, thereby increasing consumer demand and putting upward pressure on prices.

That is something that is lost on most, including academic researchers in Finance. With a share of stock, one can argue that variance of returns or standard deviation serves as a reasonable proxy for risk, because if the price of a share of stock touches zero, then the firm is bankrupt and the share forever worthless.
However, with commodities like gold, oil, or bitcoins, the price theoretically could hit zero, only for someone somewhere later to decide that it were no longer worthless. Granted, this scenario is unlikely, but it is not *impossible*. In fact, prices could go *negative*, if people decided that the commodity were garbage, only to change their minds back later.

For those of you who do not have PhDs in Finance, this is what we in the profession call a meaningless string of buzzwords.
Options pricing models have the option price as the dependent variable (that is the one over by itself on the left side of the = sign), and spot (current market) price, strike price, time to expiration, and variance as independent variables (all that complex algebra gobbledygook on the right side of the = sign).
In order to calculate one of these five factors, you need the other four. That's just how algebra works. If you doubt me, ask any 15-year-old who has a decent high school GPA.
The claim above is that the current (spot) price is 'wrong', and that it should be something else. However, the only way to know that would be to have data on price variance (check), the strike price of the option (um, *what* option? We don't have those yet!), the time to expiration of the option (um... *helllooo*? ***What*** option?!?), and the option price (you get the idea).
Without an options market, it is ***impossible*** to calculate an implied 'correct' price based on options prices.

Bitcoin is like the elephant in the ancient story of the N Blind Men and the Elephant, where n is usually between six and eight, "men" in this context is a gender-neutral term, and the elephant is only a metaphor and not an exploited species.
Bitcoin *is* what it is, and it *does* what is encoded into the software. Everything else is metaphors that we use to describe this weird new this thing that many of us find so very fascinating. The term 'cryptocurrency' is this generation's equivalent of 'iron horse' (locomotive), 'horseless carriage' (automobile), or 'information superhighway' (Internet) in previous centuries.
One of Bitcoin's many features is that it can be used *as money*—as prison inmates can use cigarettes *as money*—even though it rarely is used as a **unit of account**, and essentially never as a **measure of value**. (Quick question to the reader, and no fair using a calculator: Without referencing *any* other asset, how many bitcoins is your bicycle worth?

What is practiced today is basically a mirror image of conventional banking, but as close to being Shari'a compliant as possible. Fundamentally, this is impossible, due to national regulations in most jurisdictions and to international banking treaties.

The Wikipedia article on the [Intrinsic Theory of Value]( states, "An intrinsic theory of value (also called theory of objective value) is any theory of value in economics which holds that **the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic or contained in the item itself. Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process**, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value."
The concept of 'intrinsic value' is based on the [Labor Theory of Value]( which was shown to be erroneous in the 1870s independently by Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras.

Perhaps, but some of us share your apparent expectation that Bitcoin's *real* value is in the Moneypunk 3.0 (aka Cryptocurrency 2.0) applications built atop it.
Bitcoin, like cigarettes, can be used *as money*, and demand for either as a medium of exchange should provide upward pressure on their market values. In this sense, merchant acceptance is not irrelevant.
However, their real value lies in their unique uses.

If some money is 'dirty' and other money is not, then not every unit  is presumed to be identical to every other, meaning that the money is not fungible.
Considering that fungibility is one of the core features of a money—the others being: portability, durability, scarcity, and divisibility—if the money is not fungible, then *it is not money*.
Granted, it might be possible to *use it as money*, as prison inmates can *use cigarettes as money*, but if one eliminates fungibility, then one reduces the moneyness of money.
Similarly, prohibitions on the carrying of large sums of cash reduce money's portability, 'quantitative easing' (i.e., massive inflation) reduces money's scarcity, and the seizing of abandoned accounts reduces money's durability.
Take a couple steps back and look at this from a distance, and it appears that this is not about Bitcoin, *per se*, but an attack on *money*.

83% of the world's population lives outside OECD member states.  For simplicity, assume that only very few have bank accounts, then round creatively.
83% + 3.4% = 86.4%
86.4% * 7 billion = 6.05 billion
Close enough for government work.

There is a cost for every benefit, and almost always a benefit lurking within every cost. Bitcoin is ideal for transactions that do not require quasi-instantaneous clearing, especially if the value transferred is relatively large. The downside is that it is not ideally suited to small face-to-face transactions.
The Bitcoin protocol is intentionally inefficient—largely through transaction fees and confirmation delays—in order to reduce the incidence of 'spam' in the form of microtransactions. As with gold, it could be that Bitcoin serves better as backing for applications that clear very quickly, like a bar of gold in a vault that backs coins and notes, than as hand-to-hand currency.
Don't get me wrong. Although classifying bitcoins as property seems to give traders access to things like Like-Kind Exchange, the record-keeping for an active altcoin speculator, who trades Bitcoin against Litecoin against Dogecoin against whatever else, could be as prohibitively costly as it would be for a Bitcoin investor who uses his or her bitcoins to buy stuff from Overstock and Tiger Direct.

We at [Bitcountant]( expected that bitcoins would be classified as property, and we were right. Of course, we could have been wrong, but we reasoned that US government officials were not going to put the Bitcoin system in the same category as the central bank of a small nation-state, especially as this 'nation' is a globe-spanning diaspora with no homeland.
By doing so, IRS officials handed Bitcoin users a gift in the form of access to lower long-term capital gains rates and the kinds of loopholes that billionaires use to defer taxes indefinitely.

Quick show of hands: How many here encrypt their email with any consistency?
After Phil Zimmerman released PGP, we were convinced—we *knew*—that everyone would encrypt their communications and install little encryption dongles on their telephone lines. (We used to plug our phones into our walls, and phone numbers used to be associated with physical locations rather than specific individuals, but that's a different story.)
Nope, nope, and nope again.
Almost no one demands that private data be secured with public key cryptography rather than [stored conveniently in password-'protected' databases]( and the vast majority refer to sloppy, lazy security malpractice as 'identity theft'.
We no longer have any privacy to sacrifice. Even our most private financial and medical records are stored in centralized databases that are readily available to corporate executives and government officials.

One of the defining characteristics of money is that it is fungible. However, if some money is 'dirty' and some money is 'clean', then it is not fungible, and thus it is a little bit less *money*. If I have received 'dirty' money from someone, and I am unable to spend it, it stops being a medium of exchange for me.
As for using the global financial system to fight terrorism—however defined and by whom—it doesn't matter what any of us here feels, believes, or thinks.
It *is* being used in this way, and bank executives essentially have been deputized involuntarily to enforce the policies that underlie that fight. Posting support or opposition here is unlikely to influence the decisions of policy makers.
The executives at Bank of America, JP Morgan, and all the others are not declaring Bitcoin to be high-risk because they don't like lucrative lines of business. They do it because they've been *told* to by individuals with the power to issue such instructions.

...wayyy out on the far fringes of the city, where we concentrate the tourists to keep them out of our hair. Inland, we have one of the most important logistics hubs in the world.


Quite the contrary. The second-largest tourist attraction in Florida, after Disney World, is Sawgrass Mills, a shopping mall west of Fort Lauderdale that has regular bus service from Miami, Miami Beach (a completely separate city from Miami, btw), and the airports.
People come here from the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe *specifically* for the shopping, which is among the best in the world.

1) Miami specifically, and South Florida generally, is very diverse. It is more like the [Xindi]( arc in *Star Trek: Enterprise* than your racist stereotype suggests.

Satoshi released the code. If the code had not been released, then no one would be able to use it on Silk Road. Think of the children. Remember 9/11. [I'm *not* suggesting that any of this is a *good* thing, only that ambitious prosecutors would disagree with your analysis.]
Also, according to early Bitcoin discussions, many indications are that Satoshi's motivation was at least partially political, and that he or they wanted to undermine the *status quo*. This is what got [Bernard von NotHaus]( in trouble.
The political climate in North America and Western Europe bears little resemblance to the days before the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. I mean, *bankers are calling for an end to cash*, because the needs of central government policy makers outweigh the needs of the masses... and they're being taken seriously?!? Last time I checked, banks were commercial firms, and not government agencies.
If a prosecutor was prepared to declare von NotHaus in open court a domestic terrorist for selling metal tokens and warehouse receipts, one can only imagine what Satoshi might have qualified as.

Alternatively, you could be an unbanked person, who is interested in moving up in the world. You offer some good or service for sale, and you are willing to accept Bitcoin, because you live in a place that has extremely inefficient banking services, no access to credit other than loan sharks, and no capital market worth the name.
Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation, of which I am the Executive Director, is working with entrepreneurs in India and Sub-Saharan Africa to do just this. We are beginning our beta test of a platform that enables members to start there own marketplaces that have Stripe integrated. This gives them access to US credit card holders and Bitcoin users worldwide.
Our associates in Botswana, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Uganda have very little difficulty selling their bitcoins locally.
We would like to work more with the unbanked locally, here in South Florida, but it is perversely a harder sell, for the reasons that points out.

Economics and Finance professor here. Definitely *not* taking any shots at any individual who makes this claim, aside from people like Peter Schiff and Paul Krugman, who *really* should know better. Just clarifying a point.
Peter Berstein emphasizes in his classic *A Primer on Money, Banking, and Gold*, which was published in 1968 during the waning days of the gold standard, that gold has value as money *precisely* because it is generally useless otherwise. If gold had a significant industrial or consumer use relative to its use as backing for circulating media, gold hoards that back the value of gold certificates and base coins would dwindle as the gold were used up in those alternative uses, and there would be constant pressure on bank's balance sheets to fall out of balance, as they lent out their gold reserves and some loans inevitably became uncollectible. Silver and copper have alternative uses, and this is one of the main reasons why gold is superior to them as money.
This Bling Theory of Value is essentially the claim that the world economy from antiquity until the early 1970s was enabled by the fact that chicks and cathedral builders dig shiny stuff. (OK, and dentists, who used it to fill cavities in patients' teeth.)
The highest and best use of a bar of gold, is, was, and will be to sit on a shelf in a locked vault. Once you take a bar of gold out of the London Bullion Market Association chain of custody, it ceases being *good delivery* and loses a substantial amount of its value, until it is re-assayed and locked back up. 
**Bitcoin**, on the other hand, has a *lot* of alternative uses that make it preeminently useful, and none of which—aside, maybe, from Proof of Burn schemes—use it up in production or consumption.
If Peter Schiff were *half* the goldbug that he pretends to be, he'd be hanging out with us, swapping humorous anecdotes and naughty drinking songs.

Finance professor here, who has a paper on Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF) due for publication soon.
The problem is that Shari'a and the Basel Treaties contradict each other in several key areas, and that IBF is still a work in progress. Early attempts to set up 'Islamic banks' largely have focused on trying to approximate more closely Shari'a-compliant financial relationships. The next generation should focus on Shari'a-inspired financial arrangements.

There is a minority of us who understand that all human action is individual action, markets are social institutions and not mechanical devices, prices are not physical quantities like mass but the midpoint between the optimists and the pessimists, and if you guess Paul Krugman's *real* name he'll go away.

It also depends on the language. English speakers generally are accustomed to creative and unexpected combinations of English words on the Internet, given how many worldwide speak English as a second or subsequent language.

All human action is individual action. Collectives do not have volition. Societies, classes, corporations, nations, countries, races, religions, etc. cannot *do* anything. Only individuals empowered to make decisions can do anything.

'America' did not declare war on Afghanistan and Iraq after a dozen Saudi Arabians destroyed the World Trade Center; Pres.

The whole point of a decentralized system is that there is no demigod CEO to venerate. Hold *everyone* in a position of influence to the highest standards, no matter if it is Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Nick Szabo, Adam Back, or anyone else whose name everyone around here recognizes.
They are all human, and they all have agendas. If one agrees with one or the other agenda, great. Support it. Promote it. Write it on your forehead with a Sharpie.

Finance professor here. If you get rid of the speculators, you get rid of the liquidity. If we ran the speculators out of Bitcoin, the 'market' would consist of a handful of merchants who accept it and hodlers.
If you wanted to buy some bitcoins, you'd have to find a merchant who didn't want them, as hodlers hodl. If you had some bitcoins that you didn't want, you might be able to sell them to a hodler, but you'd have to find one who had spare fiat.
Love them, hate them, or be indifferent to them, speculators make markets.

Why stop there? If we follow this line of reasoning through to its logical conclusion, then why couldn't NSA agents plant Trojan Horses in the kernels of all publicly available operating systems and turn on all of our webcams and microphones and copy all of our Bitcoin private keys and then not do anything for a long, long time like Bernie Madoff, until one day in the future, just when we weren't paying attention steal all of our bitcoins and have SWAT teams go to our houses, kick in our front doors, and shoot our dogs, before they carted us all off to FEMA camps in the middle of some big, square state where they don't know how to make a decent cup of coffee and then detonate a nuclear bomb in our concentration camps?

Also, note the collectivistic language: "The US... is Bitcoin friendly," "Russia has virtually declared war," "the Chinese government stepped in..."
All human action is individual action, and the edicts of individual rulers typically run counter to the will of those whom they govern, otherwise there'd be no point in issuing the edicts.
It would be surprising for the president or prime minister to go on television and command everyone to eat breakfast, inhale regularly and frequently, and tie their shoelaces properly.
If the vast majority of the individuals in a jurisdiction are engaging in some forbidden act, it is inaccurate to declare that *the jurisdiction* has banned the act.
