They ask for a return address so they can return any excess. If you do not supply one, just contact their support. I've also had a good experience with their support. I sent over the max deposit amount and they could not complete the transaction. They sent the btc back to me within a few hours (~$1k worth).

I've seen it on coinbase 2 or 3 times. Always corrects within a second or two though.

Thanks! I think the alternative is less than $0.30 or whatever the minimum credit card processing fee is

I think Circle's actually the fastest since you can buy up to $100 with a credit card from the get-go.

I have noticed that Circle's prices are always better than Coinbase's due to Coinbase's fees.

Is that a vagina?

Damn, those sellers have a great business model. Buy for $100, sell for $200

I like it.  Site looks great on Galaxy S6 edge.  Name is catchy and easy to remember.  Will sign up. 
When can we expect an android app? That would definitely drive adoption.

Price of a trezor is going down to $99 on Monday. Wonder if this code will still work.
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:47:59
Use circle for this. You can buy up to $100 in bitcoin with plastic instantly to start. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:39:05
Can I have some bits? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:21:24
It comes out to a little less than $99 with this promo code: 69e58bab723d
@_date: 2016-02-13 05:36:55
Awesome! 
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:36:29
Highly recommend investing in a trezor
