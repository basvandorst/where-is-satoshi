Once you've opened a lightning channel - what happens if you run out of funds? Does that channel close and you need to reopen a new one?
Is there any way of topping up an already existing channel without having to make another main transaction on the blockchain (I'm assuming the answer is no).
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:53:57
You can have cheap, fast transactions all recorded on the main blockchain, or you can have true decentralisation - but you can't have both.
Lightning takes all of those cheap, fast transactions off the main blockchain, in a bid to keep the blockchain unbloated.
Other crypto's may have their transactions on the main blockchain - such as ethereum but according to [this]( the BTC blockchain is ~195gb whilst the ethereum blockchain is ~635gb, but the exponential increase of ethereum's blockchain is what's worrying.

Lightning sounds amazing but I'm still trying to understand how we get past the initial TX on the main blockchain to put funds into a lightning channel?
Surely the more people that want to use LN, the more channel opening tx's there will be. How is this solved?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:36
I get all of that, but as someone else mentioned in a comment - it's the initial channel opening that's going to require on-chain transactions.
Furthermore, people may not want to keep channels open forever with all their coins, rather send a set amount, and when that runs out - open another channel.
It's this issue that needs clarifying, and in my eyes will still require a modest blocksize increase.

How on earth can they use it as a currency with fees how they currently are? Serious question.

Honestly, anyone that's been in bitcoin for the past 5 years or so, or someone that's been watching Mr. Robot knew this was their plan all along.
Their problem is, they're not just addressing baby boomers who are addicted to mainstream, centralised information - they need to seriously consider the well-informed millennials and future generations who simply don't buy their bullshit anymore.
Watching these types of videos is simply confirming what Bitcoin initially set out to do. Disrupt the entire corrupted banking system.

Surely this should be keeping in line, or very closely in line with the main BTC price? The only difference (in my mind) is that you can acquire GBTC via 401k, and essentially you don't need any knowledge on how to store BTC safely and securely. Essentially though, you don't control the private keys.
That's why I can't understand why BTC isn't keeping in line with GBTC?

I agree, but in terms of tracking real world assets, I don't understand why there can't be a service that exists that would simply hash a whole load of data, and then enter that hash into the bitcoin blockchain - the most secure blockchain of them all.
I might be missing something, and if i am, I'd love someone to ELI5 - but let's say I wanted to keep every record of who owns what property in London. Could I not just hash all that data, and make a tiny transaction on the bitcoin blockchain (and then rinse and repeat perhaps once per day or once per week etc), and pay the relevant mining fee to get it into the next block. Anyone who wanted to question the validity of that hash, could simply get all of the data, and hash it themselves to check the hash matches. Obviously I get that there would be privacy concerns about getting all the raw data before it's hashed - but surely this concept would work?
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:44:26

Disagree. Earn that prosperity by investing time. One key factor people seem to be missing with bitcoin is the investment of time. That time should go into the background of bitcoin, together with the acquisition - and most importantly the security of any acquisition. If people aren't prepared to do that, then quite frankly - they don't deserve the benefits of this tech.
Part of the reason we're in such a financial mess to begin with, is because we outsource so much trust and knowledge to third parties. Knowledge really is power.

Your getting it all wrong. That's the time when the brightest minds in the industry get to work and continue to build beautiful things for bitcoin.

Are you kidding? 5 years ago, when I asked people if they'd heard of Bitcoin it was almost always a resounding no. Now when I ask, they all respond with yes and their interest is piqued. 
Adoption doesn't happen instantaneously. Cars didn't replace horses overnight. Ask a Venezuelan if they'd rather hold their nation's currency or bitcoin, and then you'll start to question your whole adoption theory. 
See the bigger picture and try not to focus on the price too much. Lots of things are happening behind the scenes. Each time bitcoin "dies" and comes back, it's another reason for that person that initially dismissed it, to look into it again and do more research and have their epiphany moment.

I can do recurring payments on Revolut, but how do I automate it once that money reaches coinbase?
Edit: answered my own question. Once there are actual funds in the GBP account, you can setup a recurring payment. So for anyone else looking to do a recurring purchase on coinbase in the UK:
1. Link your UK bank account
2. Setup a standing order from your UK bank account -&gt; Coinbase
3. Log into Coinbase, and head to tools -&gt; recurring payments
4. If you've got funds in your GBP account you'll be able to setup a recurring payment

Before you invest your money, invest your time in learning how to safely secure it. The cheapest way for you to do that would be a paper wallet - but do your research. If you go down the paper wallet route, make sure you send a minuscule amount first, and then try and get it out of the paper wallet. Once you're confident in doing that, then you can send the rest to a new paper wallet.
Remember, only invest what you can afford to lose.

People like you aren't even worth reasoning with. But for others that may not be as au fair with all this and read your mindless bullshit, it's worth pointing out that the bitcoin blockchain doesn't scale very well at its base layer. Blockchain inherently don't, but it doesn't need to scale to record every single transaction on it. That's why very clever people such as Elizabeth Stark strive to build layer 2 solutions. There may very well be layer 3 solutions too, but ultimately they are all backed by something of value, bitcoin, that can't be easily produced nor debased by constant inflation.

I'm just absolutely baffled. Paypal news sent the price rocketing on Tuesday, and I genuinely believed that may have been a turning point in confidence. Nope, we're almost back to the levels of pre-Paypal announcement.
I know what people are going to say; if you're just focussed on the price, then bitcoin isn't for you. That's not what I'm getting at, but for bitcoin to really succeed globally, it needs a significantly higher market capitalisation than $5-6bn.
Recently, there's been nothing but good news. Literally, nothing but good news - and if that good news can't encourage confidence, I'm genuinely baffled as to what will.
Everyone's talking about Amazon potentially accepting - but after Paypal's announcement (yep, I know it's not the entire Paypal behemoth accepting), I think if Amazon was to accept, it'd just be the same little spike, and then slowly deplete back down to where it was.
Bitcoin isn't napster, I think we're agreed on that - but I just don't know what is needed to really get the wheels in motion.

Hi Ben, welcome to money 2.0. Your lobbyist cronies can buy you all the steak dinners they want to, but understand that bitcoin is self-regulated. 
The current fiat economy is regulated, and in case you haven't noticed we've been in a downward economic spiral for over half a decade. Quantitive easing isn't stopping any time soon either. 
How about you and your banking friends do us all a favour and keep your big fat noses out of a financial technology that poses incredible benefits and transparency for humanity.

My experience with Circle started by finding out I couldn't add a UK based bank account. I messaged support and they instantly got back to me informing me I could connect an international credit/debit card, and that should work.
I didn't hold my breath, but to my surprise - it worked first time. I'd say that without a shadow of a doubt, purchasing bitcoin on Circle has been the most painless experience I've ever had. The whole process takes literally 20-30 seconds, if that.
The user interface is absolutely beautiful, the usability, functionality - all of it. They've nailed the holy trinity right there.
I can't wait until this product is released for the public. I generally feel it's going to have a massive positive effect on bitcoin.
I now find myself purchasing a lot more online goods in bitcoin, and going back to circle to reload (which takes little time, as opposed to previous methods of acquiring coin).

I'll be honest, today was the first time in a while that i've had to experience this. I swept a paper wallet about an hour and a half ago, 110sat/b - still waiting for the first confirmation.
I've been involved with bitcoin for close to 4 years. For the people just getting interested - if this was their first transaction, i'm not sure they'd be that impressed.
I'm all for SegWit, and ultimately LN, but how's anyone supposed to open a channel on LN when transaction times and fees are this cumbersome?
I also get that irrational decisions shouldn't be made - but how long has this scaling debate been going on? We're not even guaranteed SegWit if consensus doesn't get to 95%.

Yep, ignore this. I'm from UK and I've successfully connected a visa debit card with no problem whatsoever.
I was at the coinscrum event in London on Monday night. Whilst having a cig outside, Jeremy Allaire came out and we had a long conversation. One of the things I mentioned to him is that he needs to make it more obvious that if you're not from USA, you can still add funds via debit/credit cards. 
His response was, because there are variable transaction fees for different card providers - they want to have a comprehensive list of all these charges before they start actively recommending that non-US residents add funds.
I should also add that contrary to what a lot of people think - he's actually a top, down to earth bloke who dedicated a considerable amount of time speaking to me.

I feel you should add something to the nontechnical white paper.
Most of these big corporations are nothing without the technical geniuses that get their hands dirty and essentially help create the service these corporations offer. You should mention that BitCloud is asking people like them to come forward.
Remember CEO's and board directors rarely have the actual technical know-how and skill set to provide the services their corporations offer.
Finally, I'd just like to say that this could be one of the hugest technical revolutions ever.

Interesting. I went into CeX in Watford, UK yesterday. Just wanted to use bitcoin in a store. Apparently, no-one had done it before - and after waiting a good 10 minutes whilst they fumbled behind the counter, I decided to leave. 
So, if anyone from CeX head office is reading this - train your staff on how to use this, it was a little embarrassing for both parties.

I think I'm veering more towards SegWit, but I'm keen to understand why you think BU is trying to destroy Bitcoin?
It's my understanding that both SegWit and BU both have bitcoin's best interests at heart..?
EDIT: having read through this entire thread, one thing is clear to me. Divide and conquer. Our community, bitcoin as a whole - not segwit supporters, not BU supporters; all Bitcoin supporters - is being poisoned. This whole thread is just insidious. 
There is such passion on both sides of this debate. Why the F**K can't we all just combine that passion and move forward FFS. Can we not work out our differences, respect each other and get-shit-done!

Edit: For the record, I don't think Ross should've gotten away with this scott free and escaped prosecution.

On breadwallet, I deleted the app. Reinstalled. 
I opened it and then went to "start/restore another wallet". I entered the original seed. It then asked me to enter it again (this time with an orange background). I enter it, it then asks for my pin, it asks me to verify pin - then I get a black screen. So I have to quit the app, open again. Balance zero.

To be fair to OP, he has a point. What people need to realise is, a lot of the late 2013 bubble was fuelled by the willie bot at gox.

They're very diplomatic in their wording. Truth is, the limit needs raising now. Segwit is great, but the reality is we've been waiting a long time for a block size increase and we simply cannot afford to wait much longer.

I personally think bitcoin is a good investment but that it also comes with an element of risk. When you consider the absolute disarray our financial system is in, and consider the few safe havens left - bitcoin I believe is one of them. 
When people like Jamie Dimon try to defame it, it only gives me more belief in bitcoin. Who has ever trusted anything that central bankers say or do? Just watch the new film, "the big short" for further confirmation of that. 
With all that said, you need to be aware that bitcoin is still reasonably embryonic in that it's not even been around for 10 years. You should never risk more than you can afford to lose.
Investing in Bitcoin the currency is one side of the coin (excuse the pun). The other, is investing your time into understanding how it works, and moreover proper, diligent security practices such as cold storage, paper wallets etc. 
Finally, you're thread title implies that you've already made your decision if you're asking people to convince you.
So my advice is: do your research and own your keys. 
Welcome to the future of money.

I mean, if Bitcoin isn't owned by anyone per-se, who can they come running after (despite the fact that they're effectively stealing from Bitcoin's idea). The only way I can see them coming after Bitcoin is by targetting the dev's - but if the dev's were to use pseudonym's on github and add to the code that way, would that be a way to get round these vultures?

Preach. This whole idea of if you support BU you're against bitcoin is ridiculous. The truth is, I think the vast majority of both sides want what's best for bitcoin, whether that's core supporters or bu supporters.
Everyone wants scaling, but not everyone wants scaling to _just_ be off-chain. I see absolutely no reason whatsoever why there can't be scaling both on-chain and off-chain, and yes, I understand that SegWit brings a 2mb increase - but right now, with 1mb blocks - ~2mb blocks still doesn't cut the mustard.
FTR - that doesn't make me pro BU, nor does it make me pro core - it makes me pro bitcoin. If there's one thing we can almost all agree on, it's the future success of bitcoin.

I'm curious, and would love someone to ELI5. How are these lightning hubs going to work? If I want to open a channel, do I need to create a transaction on the main blockchain? What if bitcoin grows signficantly so that millions of people want to open up a hub, do we not find ourselves in the same position of having full blocks and therefore high fees?

Let's be honest with ourselves though. It's in a state off disarray right now and whilst Hearn's departure doesn't mark the death of bitcoin, it helps to validate some extremely worrying concerns about bitcoin. 
I'll remain hodling, but it's clear to see unless something significant happens soon, this experiment could fail. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:01:08
But we've been discussing scaling for how long now, a good 2 and a half years? We could have HF'd long ago - before these transaction fees started getting silly.  Maybe, just maybe if we'd have done that, miners would have been more open to signalling quicker...

Damn I love this community. Thanks for all the answers. Just blew a few 100k sats on lightning spin and I can already see that I can receive a lot more now. 
From a UX point of view though, its be great if there was a solution to this in the future whereby i don't need to spend in order to receive. That's not a diss to the devs because I think what they've done, and continue to do is incredible.

I do see where you're coming from - but you could argue that gold is also conceptual in that apart from making shiny things out of it - it has no other intrinsic value. It's been used for centuries because it was scarce, malleable, fungible etc but we now live in a digital age - and for the first time, have digital scarcity, and this digital scarcity (bitcoin) has all the other features gold has and more - it's just not something tangible that we can hold in our hands. Moreover, as the war on cash continues and people get accustomed to not handling money, bitcoin transactions will become more normal.
When you couple digital scarcity with all of bitcoin's other features - I truly do believe it will be here for the long run.
One of the reasons the internet won't vanish, is because it's now baked into so many different threads of society, and with time - I think bitcoin will be too, allowing for it to become fundamental and necessary in many different industries etc.
Just like the internet isn't going to vanish, neither do I think bitcoin will.

# BISQ. IS. AWESOME.
Before this post, I'd often seen people mention it - but never invested the 5 minutes it took to download and setup. I just did. I'm blown away by how professional the UI is, and the UX is great too.
I don't know whether this trade might be the quickest yet on Bisq, but I just bought a small amount of BTC - money was transferred to sellers account, and **I literally received the bitcoin about 19 minutes later**. 
I'll be honest, I may have got extremely lucky, both with speed of the transaction and with the seller being trustworthy, but either way - this is my first time, and it worked an absolute treat.
If you've been deliberating over whether to give bisq a shot - please, give it a go.

@_date: 2017-01-02 16:34:58
it's all love. I've met Jeremy, several times, and have had deep conversations with him about bitcoin. He has bitcoin's best interests at heart but as others have mentioned in this thread - buying and selling is not where their business is making money, and as a shrewd businessman he chose to stop that.
I'll be the first to admit - I was pissed when they stopped because it was so easy to acquire bitcoin on Circle. I've since signed up to coinbase, and despite all the negative stuff that I read on this sub about coinbase, my experience so far has been top draw.
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:33:05
This is a very good comment that's actually made me stop and think. 
I too want bigger blocks but fully agree the best developers for Bitcoin are the core devs. 
With that said, I still find it utterly baffling that core devs wont do a block size increase to say 2-4mb in addition to segwit. It is this one thing that I just can't get my head around. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:26:42

So I want to claim my coins on the other chain. I'm reading that you can't sweep a paper wallet into trezor - so would this be the correct method to go with?
1. Sweep paper wallet using breadwallet
2. Send sweeped funds to trezor
3. Sweep same paper wallet mentioned in step 1 into an iOS BCH wallet (any recommended apps out there?)
4. Exchange BCH for btc
Would that work?

For the price to go insanely high and only keep increasing. Why? So all these outlets that have been calling for bitcoin's death \(such as Financial Times\) have egg on their faces. So all the altcoiners who have no appreciation for the fact that without bitcoin their coins would be worthless have egg on their faces. So that volatility decreases \- because once we're at much higher levels I believe volatility will be history.

From a UX perspective though, I had no idea about the swiping - and I'd suspect I'm not the only one. Fantastic that it's there but it might be worth making it more apparent to users, unless you guys are intentionally trying to get users more use to the idea of bits - which isn't the worst idea in the world.

@_date: 2017-01-28 12:16:42
I still haven't seen a valid argument for why segwit + 2mb fork hasn't happened. From my understanding, that's what was agreed at that miner meeting. Though tbh, i'll be the first to admit I don't know all the details.
To me it seems though, miners are sticking to their guns and will only agree to SegWit if there's a 2mb HF too.

from what I understand, difficulty is adjusted according to the network's hashrate. High hashrate = high difficulty, and therefore requires more hashing power - so if a person/organisation has lots of miners, they have more hashing power and therefore increase their chances of solving a block.

It's a great idea as effectively if you're holding onto cash - you're only option is to get  ass-raped by the exchange rate by any bank/post-office/fx bureau etc. However, if they were able to convert coins as well - this would take it to the next level. I'd 100&amp; use that.

I'm pretty certain bitcoin is now hear to stay. It's endured FUD and disparaging news time and time again and returned stronger and stronger each time. 
Before putting money into it, understand what you're getting into. If you believe in the fundamentals, believe in your (potential) investment. 
People were asking if the price was too high at $1k, the same at $2k, $3k and so on. We're now at $7k and whilst in the short term it could go down, I believe long term, it has a bright future. No one can be 100% sure where this is headed but one things for sure, cryptocurrency is starting to grow up, and grow up fast.
The best time to plant a tree was 100 years ago. The next best time is now.

It's worth mentioning there are many seasoned hodlers amongst this community. This community witnessed a bear market for a good 2 years watching it drop from highs of ~$1200 -&gt; ~$160. A lot of those people held on. 
People who got in really early too don't have as much to lose. There are some people sitting on 100s, others on 1000s of coins that acquired them for peanuts. So whilst their paper profits would be wiped, it's almost impossible for them to make a loss.
In any case, your advice should probably be heeded. Thanks

@_date: 2019-01-24 14:15:52
I'm thinking out loud, but I think it could work - because I believe bitcoin would be the fundamental asset that backs other currencies, and thus hold and increase btc's value.
Other inflationary currencies (both sovereign and digital/crypto) would then have a price pegged to the bitcoin rate, and the credit would be lent in this.
For instance, imagine BTCc (bitcoin credit) as a crypto currency, that operates on a sidechain and has similar properties to bitcoin, but isn't deflationary - ie there is no capped supply but a fixed and predictable inflationary rate.

I find it warming that as a community we can all have a laugh about this. The same people that are currently saying I told you so, will be the same people calling it a bubble when the next cycle starts. 
I strongly believe this is a massive shakeout. Don't get me wrong, it rose far too quickly, but people that have been around here for a while need to realise that even if it drops to $3.5k, there's still close to 250% gains in 12 months. 
If people followed rule number one - don't invest more than you can afford to lose - then this should just be a rollercoaster ride. There are up's and down's but ultimately the technology has never been stronger. Lightning, shnorr, mast etc. 
I think the futures bright, and it also allows this sub to have proper discussions again, not just price discussions.

As stupid as it sounds - I actually don't think you can cash GBP out. Even once you've connected your bank account. They used to allow GBP withdrawals, but stopped. I think you'll need to buy BTC with the GBP, then sell the btc for EUR. You then withdraw the EUR.

In answer to your question, you should dollar cost average (DCA). Put aside what you're willing to invest, and split it over a period of months. 
Ultimately, if you believe bitcoin will succeed, invest what you can afford to.

Whatever happens, it's clear there has been a lot of hard work and collaboration that has gone into this, so props to everyone involved with that.
Can someone ELI5 the sort of timelines before this gets actually integrated into the network? I'm not technical enough to understand the absolute intricacies, so any pointers would be helpful. 
It's safe to say though, Core did say that SegWit would be imminent, and clearly they've now delivered.

Bitcoin is bitcoin, because it's bitcoin. One of the most beautiful aspects of bitcoin is the fact that there's no-one for the authorities to target. To try and frame, discredit and say "look guys - we've now discovered the creator of bitcoin did this and that".
Whether you're a fan of Assange's work or not, the fact is he has exposed countless cases of corruption. Look what happened to him.
If people want bitcoin to succeed and at the same time also want to know who the real satoshi is, they should be very careful about what they wish for.

Massive props to the developers. Absolute pioneers.

FTR, I have no affiliation with cointracker.io and used to love CMC. Unfortunately they've put profit over usability now, so you can't even track coins on mobile as it just straight up redirects you to malware websites.

Let's be honest though, there's enough drama in Bitcoin now to create a fucming trilogy of epic films.

Thanks for the response.
Let me give some more examples of what I mean. On bread wallet app, I have a seed that will restore all the addresses if I was to lose or have my phone stolen. 
Can this be done with paper wallets so if I lose them, I can restore all addresses with just one seed / brain wallet. Basically I'd like the peace of mind that I can restore some paper wallets via a seed. 
Hope that makes sense.

I just don't by this mentality though. If Bitcoin succeeds in the way some of the luminaries such as Wences think it will, the difference between c.$370 and sub $300 is insignificant, ergo if you really wanted to buy coins, you'd buy them now.

I'll be the first to admit I'm not technical enough to really know what the best solution is for scaling bitcoin, but I'm wise enough to know that both sides of the debate want what's best for bitcoin. What I do know, is this debate has been taking place for 18months+ and the technology has yet to scale. 
The fact that certain discussions aren't allowed to take place on this sub should be a real eye-opener. Whether you're pro-small blocks or pro-big blocks, the whole ethos of bitcoin is one of liberty and freedom. When this sub doesn't allow certain opinions and views for bitcoin scaling, I think that's a little hypocritical and short-sighted. I see pros and cons for both sides of the argument, but when one side is censored to the point a new subreddit needs opening, something is very wrong. 
Maybe someone can enlighten me, but one of bitcoins greatest feats is PoW. If the vast majority of transactions take place off-chain, is there a proposal in place to provide PoW off-chain?
Didn't Satoshi himself predict that nodes would ultimately end up being hosted by server farms? Doesn't SPV help counter the need for nodes reading the entire Blockchain?
These are genuine questions, I know a little about a lot, but certainly no expert, so would invite the experts here to enlighten me on the pros and cons for small-blocks with off-chain scaling, vs bigger blocks. 
Either way, let's keep it civil and realise that ultimately everyone who has an argument for bitcoin, only displays that passion because they want bitcoin to succeed.

Wright has had his chance to prove himself. He could put all these critics to bed, but hasn't.
All he needs to do is sign a message with Satoshi's keys - but he won't. Is that not proof enough that he's not Satoshi?
Gavin is human and every human has flaws, there is a bin chance he just got duped here. 
Andreas played this whole saga right imo.

Not sure if you're jehsting but this is exactly how we get to more decentralised mining. A washing machine that pays for its own electricity via mining. A smart contract on top of that where the user can choose to pay electricity costs directly, or hodl and continue to pay the traditional way.

He's one of the most genuine guys I know - and I've been telling him about bitcoin for a while. I got him setup with bread wallet, and printed him this little sign which he's now got in the shop. 
I really want him to see the power of BTC, and how anyone in the world can send him money by just scanning that QR code. So, if any of you can spare any bits - I'd be massively grateful if you could send some his way.
I appreciate some people are going to think this is some kind of scam, so I'd be willing to match the first 20,000 bits (if you just pm me your address and your transaction, I'll send it through).

I'd definitely say i'm a small blocker, but I just can't see any real significant arguments for centralisation with 2mb blocksize vs 1mb blocksize. SanDisk announced that they'll be releasing a 1TB SD card. Not sure if that's released yet, but that should be able to hold the entire blockchain and then some, for a good while. By the time the blockchain is even bigger, there will be even larger capacity SD cards.
If an SD card can hold 1TB, i'm really not too worried about 2mb blocks leading to node centralisation.

This is big. I'm a Revolut user and massive fan. This seems like another way to be able to spend btc via their debit card. Their debit card is also contactless too.

When will people learn. You can't have the bow, without the arrow. 
The blockchain is incentivised by bitcoin the currency. Miners aren't going to be verifying transactions and keeping the blockchain intact for free.

It'd be nice if the app automatically calculated how much 0.5 bitcoin was worth in say april 2013. Is there even a website I can do that on (enter a date, and an amount - to find out the exact dollar value at that time?)

If you think everyone on earth is going to switch from fiat to btc in a split second, you need to wake the fuck up. Stop spouting this naive drivel because you make the rest of us Bitcoin enthusiasts look batshit crazy.

This is a hilarious post. You're so concerned about the price going down, that you decided to waste 10 minutes of your life writing this shit? Seriously mate, those that want to sell will sell - those that want to hodl, will hodl. 
Today, Dell just announced acceptance of bitcoin in UK and Canada, there's tonnes of VC money coming in and products are currently being developed to further reinforce the bitcoin infrastructure.
If you think it's going much lower than the current price - put your money where your mouth is and sell some to me for $200 - I'll buy some off you.

Well well well. This is absolutely massive news. I never thought I'd see the day that high street banks in the UK would start charging customers so that they can gamble with their hard-earned cash.

I love your enthusiasm and ideology. Unfortunately back here on planet earth, Bitcoin is not yet widely adopted enough to act as a p2p currency, and we all hope that one day it will. 
I think companies like Wirex, Xapo and everyone else that do these Bitcoin debit cards are actually helping the wider adoption of Bitcoin. 
Just today a friend asked - what can I buy with Bitcoin, and I said "anything you can buy with a debit card". I then talked about Wirex and Xapo and now he wants to buy some Bitcoin. I can't 100% say that would've been the case of it was t for services like Wirex and Xapo.

Are they limited in supply? It's got some noteworthy names associated with it (the creator of JavaScript) but the ico sounded a little shady - something like 4 or 5 people scooped the lot. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:51:54
I detest CSW as much as the next guy, but I do think there could be some validity in  theory. I also think there's a good chance he was part of the original, dispersed team, but playing a smaller role than he'd like to believe. 
The truth is, it's time we put the satoshi witch hunt to bed. What satoshi has given us is a true gift, he/she/they didn't want to be known - they've helped the world out, let's not return that favour by trying to hunt them down and outing him/her/them. No-one wins in that scenario.
We've got an amazing thing here - let's be grateful for it, and shift our focus towards bullet-proofing bitcoin and increasing adoption through sensible and well thought-out scalability solutions.

Try getting a bank account for a non-btc business. Took me 2 months to get a face to face meeting with someone. 
People would be a lot more interested if they were educated. If the 6pm news gave a 2 minute demo of it, it would intrigue many. I suppose ignorance is bliss for some. Knowledge is power for the rest of us.

So you're losing out on potential custom, maybe even repeat custom. You don't even need to hold the btc, you can convert to fiat with services such as bitpay. 
You clearly have the business acumen of a roast potato.
