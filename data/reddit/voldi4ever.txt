25 ledgers, 1 bitcoin each. Dont be naive and secure your investment.

Wait till you reach 1000nds. Which exchange do you use? Enabla 2fa and you are relatively safe if the exchange you are using not a shady one.

Did it today. We will see. This problem occured back in the day with other people and got resolved but it took some time.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:21:17
Ok guys. It has been 2 weeks and still no response. They try to look helpfull in here and reply posts but no real communication. All I get a reply bot email and that is pretty much f.cked up.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:46:47
Btw guys, noone even replied to my email. It is just a cheap pr move from coinbase to write here so they look like they are on top of the issue.

What would happen if china takes over these facilities and continue mining?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:09:36
Let the other people think. Get some rest.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:42:55
It does not work. I tried couple of times.

Let the other people think. Get some rest.

They double charged my account and they are not responding to my ticket or emails for over 2 weeks now.  Probably in about a hour someone from coinbase reddit team will write here about how sorry they are and pm them my ticket number....

Yes you must carry it with you all the time. Where are you? Lets meet for some beer. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:30:06
I can only see 2 weeks from now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:53:05
A lot of hookers and cocain. Books. I mean books.

Ask him if he also sells some kidneys. He looks like a guy with resources...
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:43:54
Come on Rae. You wrote the same thing to my post 1 week ago and still no response. Dont try to fool people by trying to look good on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:17:16
No. There is no news about accepting it. Although they want to embrace blockchain technology and understand it fully. I suppose once this happens, they might favor cryptocurrencies. They dont want to miss the crypto train. It is a good thing.

If it is tempered it wont connect to wallets. Ledger has its own authentication 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:54:25
Tell them to sell everything and go all in. 
Then ask for their private keys. Transfer all btc and run away to Caribbean island. 
Joke aside, dont do any of these.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:43:55
Yes I am. I read the article on a newspaper today.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:33:43
I would give up my 2fa for this
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:27:52
Yes 2 payments is cleared from my bank but only 1 btc shows on my coinbase. My initial aim was only buying 1 btc. They double charged.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:53:59
Even if one of them goes to the popular section of reddit, it is worth it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:11:59
Op dont trust him. He is fed!
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:02:22
Amazing device. So easy to use
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:55:54
I can see the news
"Mysterious death of a lovely father"
"Youngest crypto millionaire says he is following his father's footsteps"
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:52:40
This made me giggle

I wrote a poem and hid the seed words in it. Only I know the algorithm to extract those words in it.
