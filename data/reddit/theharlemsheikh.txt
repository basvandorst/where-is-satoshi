Please don't email Groupon. Find someone who isn't retarded and have them do it for you.

I honestly don't understand why everyone has such a rosy picture of the gold standard,  it's not like the invention of fiat was a part of some vast conspiracy to rob everyone of their wealth. There were (and are) very good reasons every nation in the world stopped using gold as a basis for currency,  namely the global economy was growing exponentially faster than gold could be produced and it ceased being practical. Anyway that's my rant, getting kinda tired of the bitcoin = gold metaphor :p

And don't forget the people who say I should spend my bitcoins because it's "good for bitcoin." Who the hell spends euros because it's "good for the euro?" evangelists cannot into economics.

technically speaking several of those 34 countries use a common currency ie the East Caribbean Dollar and the Central African Franc.

It's also, like bitcoin,  inherently deflationary and therefore terrible for debtors. Why would I take out a loan of 1k btc at $12 each to start a business, when for all I know I could have to pay it back at $145 each plus interest?
