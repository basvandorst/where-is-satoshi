Well, the women handing out bitcoins in the picture are obviously dressed for  attention. Why should it be insulting to other women for reddit to acknowledge their hotness? Sounds like insecurity.

What, so customers can wait around for 5-10 minutes while the transaction confirms?

Then again, if bitcoin is ever going to be successful, it needs to be a lot easier to use than the stock market. Which is the OP's point.
So this is really a pretty poor analogy.

I prefer "Three hot horiental hos"

No, no. It's good news.

Why assume a booth babe sends out the message that all the women at the conference, including the attendees, are eye candy?
Sounds like the other women are just insecure if they think that way.

I much prefer:

I don't disagree with anything you've written.
But I still don't see how you got here from my original post asking why its insulting to other women that we acknowledge the hotness of the 3 girls in the photo (well, really, only the one in the center).

LOL. That's like a black businessman complaining that the preponderence of black athletes is hurting his chances because everybody assumes he's a playa. There's probably truth to that statement, but the solution isn't for black men to quit playing sports, or for the public to quit watching sports.

Say what?! Sex is not my power tool. It's more like men are slaves to sex, women know it, and use it to their advantage.
Do you think men would put up with 5% of the crap women throw at them if it wasn't for the testosterone circulating through every last sinew of their bodies? And that's not something men can control.

I wish I could flip a switch in my brain and do that but the reality is I'm hardwired for it. Women know this and use it to their advantage all the time... Except when they get older it bugs them that men aren't paying attention to them but to younger hotter women instead. So all of a sudden they get on their moral high horse about how wicked men are for objectifying women.

Sounds like female insecurity to me. Why should a woman care if there's a booth babe hanging around a convention on bitcoin? It sounds an awful lot like collective morality punishing a woman for wanting to be a booth babe, and punishing men for wanting to enjoy a booth babe.

Question: how are you going to determine the cut? For instance, if I were to put in $1000, what percentage of the profit am I going to get?
Are you doing this through an S-Corp or an LLC? If the former, will we, as investors be issued shares in the company?

This. The whole thing strikes me as shady.
