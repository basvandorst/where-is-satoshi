Global Payments is more than just an e-merchant payment processor, they offer POS machines etc.  It also looks like they offer services for banks and such.  They make about 2.5bil a year, so they clearly have customers.
It seems they might be slightly higher level than you are thinking, in that they dont interact directly with specific businesses or customers, but instead interact with large businesses.  Ie. you might see a Visa machine branded with some bank on it, but the machine is actually a Global Payments machine or a large chain like Walmart might have a contract with Global Payments.
edit: Looked into it and Walmart contracts MCX, not Global Payments, but you get the idea.  They mostly target large business and banks rather than individual customers.
edit2: That being said, I cannot pin down a specific company which contracts with them.  However, it looks like they are related to Wells Fargo

Sure, but to trade you deposit funds into someones system..then start trading with those funds.  Nobody wants to send them money every time you want to make a transaction..followed by waiting days.

Does not work like that, the specific trojan repointed DNS server settings.  The people still had internet access and could still either access things by IP or just point themselves at a bloody different DNS server.  
And even if the US government HAD compromised all of the DNS servers, you would still be able to just run a new DNS server.  If the US government deploys an internet kill switch it will be at the ISP/backbone pipe level..not some trick with repointing DNS servers.

As far as I know (AGAIN NOT AN EXPERT), the higher clock speed will produce more heat..although not damage the device directly.  A higher voltage might damage it though, but allow for higher clock speeds....But you might want to listen to someone who actually knows

That piece of evidence is one part of many evidences building up to a case.  They would not get a warrant on that alone.

Yes, but the cartographic signatures are supposed solve that problem.  This allows you to modify a SIGNED apk to be something else, while still appearing to be SIGNED by the original author and the google store.  Cryptographically, signatures are not supposed to be breakable like that.  A cartographic signature from google is treated by the phone to mean that the app is trustworthy...and as proof to you that it is an original copy from the author.
edit: Whops,  typed that on my phone, Cryptographic

Generally speaking they just make the fees high enough to make it still profitable with some "expected loss" (along with ID verification).

I would not worry about it, border officers ask questions and gauge reactions.  I was specifically asked which tablet model I was bringing over when I brought over a nexus 7.

My main concern is that it goes to humans for things like repair and utility, and everyone could just start overcharging them..with no incentive to not.
