I’ve always wanted dogecoin, I’m definitely inspired to buy some now

Yeah I panic bought $2k after the ATH 2 days ago when it was $19k and now it’s at its lowest so I am kicking myself. All I can do is HODL long term and hope it goes back up soon. Lucky I got in at a much lower price this year

If I can’t get a wallet in time (trezors on backorder right now), and my exchange isn’t on one of those listed exchanges, how do I get this free credit of b2x? (I’m in Australia so some of these exchanges are hard to sign up and get verified for). I have coinbase but have since moved all my btc to another exchange

I am a real noob here, will the new coins as a result from this fork show up in everyone’s wallets as long as they have had btc from a certain date no matter what the exchange or wallet they are stored in? Or will we have to go claim them from somewhere??

Get your private keys tattooed on your gooch in reverse, voila.

I’m not sure what the best way to go about it is, as i am pretty new. definitely needs some sort of dialogue to be started though. But it just starts turning into flame wars.
Short term panic sellers aren’t doing it any good either, people need to look at the big picture. Look at how exponentially fast tech is moving... a few decades ago we only had color tv, now we hold super computer processing power in our hands that used to take a whole room to hold.

Yeah I’m done with coinbase too, I will miss the instant transactions, but I fucking hate the arbitrary weekly limits. I had a $500 limit then a $2000 limit and then it randomly dropped to $250 for 2 weeks. 
Aside from that I had some issues verifying my passport as I live in another country. Coinbase deleting their support email address was a red flag. What kind of ethics does a company have which gets rid of  any way of contacting them?
If you cannot handle support for your users for pretty much any issues that you have to delete your contact email and replace it with an automated piece of shit bot then you should not be rolling out new features. I’m happy that their shit crashed today and people are waking up to how shit this exchange is.

I think this is good way to put it, I heard some time ago in Copenhagen they tried to introduce high credit card fees and everyone didn’t use cards until the government took the fees away.
BUT, if everyone abandons BTC and yells “bitcoin is dead!” That’s not really addressing the issues either and it will cause BTC to fail if we don’t support it.

Wish I had this guide when I first started!
