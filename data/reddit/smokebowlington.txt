How do you sleep at night?
On top of a pile of money, with many beautiful women.

... they teach useful mathematics, economics, risk-management and economic history?
Back in my day, we colored in pictures, and I didn't hear no one complaining....

In my opinion it makes a lot more sense to invest in Bitcoin like it was any security.
Mining it is complicated and supposedly vary difficult, and gambling with it is outright crazy, since you can gamble at the horse track, which is much more fun than Bitzino.
There are a couple of places to buy coins, it can be tricky since they regulate you. Rules would be different based on where you live. A few places you can try are here:

$70K in 2017 isn't such a far out estimate. What's yours?

Personally I think this is an important discussion that people aren't talking about.
I'd say, within ten years it will be extremely uncommon for a single individual to have a Bitcoin, as this will literally represent hundreds of  thousands of dollars. mBTC will be much more common and prices will probably be listed in mBTC not BTC.
Odds are people will start doing day to day business in mBTC (1/1000 of a Bitcoin) and uBTC (1/1000000 of a Bitcoin.)

A solid investing strategy for the long-term. I'd love to hear any you have as well.

Hey Ink,
I think your idea about other crypto-currencies taking off is very interesting. I have heard that other cryptos are "technologically inferior" to Bitcoin but I'm not sure this is valid. Would you care to elaborate on why you think the other cryptos will take off?
I'm not asking you pick or choose any since that would be fairly speculative in nature.

Anyone else want to make a prediction?

There is a certain amount of risk. Right now, that seems to be a high risk, so I'd say don't keep a significant amount of money in a single wallet.

I have to say that is a pretty aggressive stance!

I disagree there is a difference between a legitimate altcoin and a scamcoin. There are relatively few scamcoins.

This seems like a pretty standard offshoot of any currency. It seems to make a lot more sense for a third party to provide this service.
