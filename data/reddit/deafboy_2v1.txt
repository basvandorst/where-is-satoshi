If any country decided to issue a bitcoin-like currency, it would be a blessing for the trust-less decentralized exchange model. That's why I was hyped about the canadian MintChip... until they scraped the idea and sold the branding to a data mining company.

If you pay via payment protocol (click the link, scan the QR code on bitpay website), the transaction is sent directly to bitpay. The counter should stop as soon as bitpay sees the transaction no matter if it got into block or not during that time.
Your scenario is only possible if OP chose to send a simple (no payment protocol) transaction and broadcast it to his peers instead of bitpay.

You're free not to use them if you trust a seller in OB.
@_date: 2016-04-25 20:38:51
The 15 minutes are usually a limit for you to send the transaction, not for the transaction to be included in a block. In case of bitpay, you're sending it straight to them instead of broadcasting it to a random peer. (however it should work either way)
 Since I have a pretty paranoid browser setup, I need to refresh the page sometimes to see it accepted by bitpay. Try that next time.

Last time i checked, both elcair and lnd were pretty CPU intensive during startup. My Intel Xeon was pretty occupied for several minutes during the initial node &amp; channel discovery.
The last thing I want is to wait 15 minutes for my channel to be fully operational just because somebody had to reboot their raspberry.
Also it's running off of an sd card, which is not exactly reliable. I know it's possible to move the os to the external storage and even set up a sw raid, but who's going to do that?
I should probably do a benchmark and measure the startup time, the time it takes to open a channel and route a payment...

Regulators could push the big mining pools and merchants to only include transactions from verified customers, but decided not to do it because they do not consider bitcoin to be money.
If we stay in the narrative that bitcoin is not money, there is nothing preventing the law abiding corporations to forward LN payments of anonymous users.

I'm 100% with you on this.


I'd say this falls under the "satoshis vision" fallacy.

@_date: 2018-01-09 20:49:52
Every full node already has the data. But the fees used in last 100 blocks is in itself a useless information. You have to consider the momentary state of the mempool which, again, every sufficiently long running full node already has.
Just formalize the message format so that full nodes can communicate this to the SPV clients.
Although if a miner includes an information like this in a block it might be easier to verify the authenticity compared to just a node operators word.

True. That's also a reason behind android eclair wallet not being able to receive LN payments.

2. Click "Autoconnect" to create a channel. &amp; wait for a confirmation
3. Scan a QR code with LN invoice to pay.

Bitcoin wallet is just a piece of software running on your PC or smartphone. Anyone can create a wallet, send and receive transactions without a permission. Bread wallet is fine. Just make sure to write down the 12 words it shows you at the beginning and store them in a safe place. You can use them to restore your wallet in case you loose your phone.
However, if you want to buy bitcoins you need to find someone who's willing to sell. Depending on where you live, look for [Bitcoin ATMs]( (they might or might not require your ID) or [online exchanges]( (most of them will ask for an ID)
If you decide to use an online exchange, it can store your bitcoins for you. That's fine if it's a small amount or you're trading often. If you plan to keep your bitcoins for a longer period of time, send them from an exchange to your local wallet. If it's a significant amount, buy a hardware wallet like [Trezor]( or [Ledger](

Whoever is making an incompatible consensus change without gaining the majority consensus and still calling the new coin "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:57:04
Depends on what do you mean by "fork".
If by fork you mean the miner creates an invalid block (rewarding himself more coins then he's entitled to, or stealing funds from an address), the rest of the miners would never follow that chain because he's not creating bitcoin blocks anymore at that point.
If by fork you mean the malicious miner creates a valid chain of blocks, later replaced by the different but still valid chain of block, then yes, other miners would eventually switch to the chain with most work done every time. This would allow the miner to attempt a double spend. He could sell you some coins, get the cash and later replace the blocks in which he transferred the coins to you.

When your bitcoind is down for longer than the time lock period (usually 24 hours) of your channels, your peers could try to steal from you by publishing an outdated channel state. You have no way of knowing, because your lightning node wouldn't receive the closing transaction.
Luckily, your peers has no way of knowing which bitcoind does your lightning node really talk to, so this attack would be risky (peer trying to cheat could lose all funds if you find out).
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:44:57
That's the point of a lightning NETWORK. You don't need to open a new channel to every vendor. You only need a channel to someone who has a channel to someone who has a channel to the vendor.

The problem is that backup won't necessarily save you if you have funds locked in channels. And password would be annoying. You'd have to enter it each time you're opening a channel.

pro tip: Don't touch the funds in bitcoin core wallet as long as eclair has some channels open.
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:23:28
With the current state of LN wallets you will have to close your original channel, add some more on-chain coins and open a new channel. (3 transactions in total) :(
In the future it will be possible to add money to an existing channel, or use a balance from multiple channels to make a single, larger payment.

In case anyone from Ledger stumbles upon this thread, I'm the guy who suggested using his own notary after the first order (well, technically 2nd) failed due to a known bug. My notary broke  because of some 3rd party library error the instant I've sent the order (already posted as bug on github, but no solution available). Shortly after that my buyer node also broke mysteriously.... so after 2 days and something like 5 attempts to order, I give up. Thanks for your cooperation in the process.
I'm really excited about OpenBazaar but I dont think the current release should be called beta. As I mentioned on IRC some time ago, the Insanity wolf himself is not alpha enough compared to openbazaar.

Centralized systems are efficient (mostly). Decentralized systems are resilient. You have to balance between.
If the resources are scarce, think hunter-gatherer society or space colony, people tend to make things more efficient.
When there are plenty of resources, you can make some systems more resilient by essentially wasting some of the resources for the greater benefit.

And provably purnabe output is kind of output in transaction that everyone knows can be removed, because it will not be used anymore in the future. (recipient of the message can save it locally if he needs to)
Some day in the future we might be able to remove all spent transactions from the blockchain.
**Simplified explanation:**
If coin goes from address A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D , you can (in theory) remove the record of first 2 movements. You could do this now but the problem is that after you do that you cannot serve the blockchain to new clients on the network anymore.

As far as I know, he signed an agreement with Ripple labs allowing him to only spend X amount of XRP over Y period of time.
But I'm still disappointed in his "new" project - Stellar, which is in fact just a Ripple fork. Similar to most Bitcoin based altcoins, it's almost the same thing just re-branded.
I'll not sign a petition, I'll not ask the vendors to accept them, I'll not publicly embrace them, but at least they deserve some respect for building alternative decentralized financial systems (like Ripple, NXT, Open transaction, monero...) from scratch.

There was a proposal of such system on bitcoin talk years ago. It could have allowed average users to use regular payment card, sign up with some account provider and even pay on regular terminals.
Security and authentication was supposed to be done via SMS. Concept is strangely similar to what Neo do.
For advanced users there was a possibility to run your own bitcoind on a server which would be contacted at the time of payment by the terminal and would send you a verification sms with address ammount and one-time pin.

Using bitcoin network to transfer units other than bitcoin is possible, but might not be the best use-case. With colored coins, you have to trust the issuer. Which introduces a single point of failure.
You might even trust your national currency, but unless the government itself issues a set of colored coins there is still need for a 3rd party to do the backing. If the company dissapears, the colored coins just lost their value regardless of the backing. Not even talking about Ripple-like confusion when two companies issue the same currency.
This is not going to happen on large scale. At least not as a Bitcon network overlay.


-No mining rigs, no transactions. I get the idea behind this, but whole article is based on lack of information. If we stop using BTC as unit of account, the whole network need some other incentive to keep running. At that point the better alternative would be some effective green heavily regulated startup ;)

As more and more people experience the problem, some smart person will get mad enough to say "fuck it, might as well try to fix it myself".

Most bitcoin wallets will generate a new receiving address after every transaction in order to improve your privacy a little. If you had only one address, everyone who you transact with would be able to see all your incoming and outgoing payments.
You can still receive money on the old addresses though.




The incoming transaction should've showed up almost instantly.
If you don't see the 2nd incoming transaction on your phone, nor on the block explorer, you should contact Circle. It's possible that they've delayed the payment for some reason.

Do you know the exact timeline? Which one was the first? BCH acceptance, or BIP70 enforcement?
I'd love to see a statistic on how many payments failed due to incorrect amount vs accidental use of a certain altcoin instead of bitcoin.
If the main issue was overpayment, that's on us, the consumers and we deserve the BIP70 for our own stupidity.
If it was the other case, that's kinda on Bitpay for accepting the altcoin with the same address format as BTC.
edit: I've found mentions about BCH acceptance from december last year, and the linked article about BIP70 complaints is from January so it's possible that they've been implemented in parallel, or pretty close to each other.

Part of the block validation is verifying a hash, but mining ASICs can't do that. They're highly specialized to do just mining.
One of the problems is that you can't send them a new job very often, which is a problem if you have a &gt;500000 distinct blocks waiting to be verified.
Another issue is that you can't send them a specific data that you want to hash. They expect a block template in a certain format and will cycle the nonce themselves.
Hope someone more knowledgeable can explain in more detail.

This is not how bitcoin works. Address format is just a representation of a key or script hash. It has little to do with the consensus rules.
Every full node would have to accept larger block size if the new addresses (which you propose) were to be inter-operable with the old ones. And that's the main problem with the base block size increase initiative. Not everyone is willing to upgrade.
edit: The reason why you can send bitcoins between segwit and normal addresses is that segwit upgrade was done in a backwards-compatible way (softfork). The old wallets don't know about the new rules that are in effect but the transactions are crafted in such a clever way that they can still understand them.
Raising the base block size would be a hardfork, which would require everyone to use a new bitcoin wallet that understands all the new rules.

1) Multibit is an SPV (simplified payment verification) client. That means it asks other full nodes for new block headers and incoming transactions. It should work regardless of the support from Multibit developers.

New coin generation is "regulated" by the consensus rules that each full node checks.

Different address is OK. Every time you receive a payment a new receiving address is generated for you. The old ones are still able to accept payments. If you'd like to see your old addresses, click View/Show addresses.
Replacable means that coinbase marked the transaction as RBF (replace-by-fee). That way they could raise the fee if it's not confirmed soon enough due to high transaction backlog. Electrum shows you the warning because the same mechanism could be used to change not only the fee but also a a recipient.

People really need to stop pushing this narrative.

It's not hard, but can be intimidating if people think they HAVE TO go through that all to use LN.

You can use the wallet.dat on another computer. install Bitcoin Core, put the wallet in the datadir, and fire it up. It will most likely take a lot of time to sync (hours to days) but it will work.
However make sure to check if it's an HD wallet (icon on the bottom right corner) and if it's not, don't use the original wallet.dat on the old computer anymore. Instead bring your wallet.dat from the new PC. It's not recommended to use the same wallet on multiple computers at the same time.
Core has been generating a random new key pairs for the old wallet format and your 2 wallet.dat files will get out of sync if the new PC decides to generate some new receiving addresses.

Bitcoin.com default BCH and BTC wallets are sharing the same seed (from which your addresses are being generated).
If you've generated some additional wallets and your BCH has seemingly not arrived, follow [this guide]( to gain access to them.
When you regain the access, you can either keep them or sell them on some reputable exchange and buy the real bitcoins instead. If you want a quick way to do that, there's [shapeshift.com]( In case you prefer more professional exchange, you can try [kraken.com](
If you decide to buy bitcoins, I recommend some [other less confusing wallet](
In case you're wondering why is it all so confusing, I'll try to sum up some history really quick:
Some people decided to change the rules of the Bitcoin (BTC) network in a non-backwards compatible way. I'll leave the reasons why as an exercise to the reader to find out. They failed to gain the support of the majority of users, merchants, developers and miners but decided to launch their own blockchain (BCH) anyway. The BCH blockchain shared the transaction history with the BTC blockchain to the certain point in time, and they both used the same address format as well. To add an injury to the insult some BCH users (bitcoin.com included) falsely tries to push an idea that BCH is the real Bitcoin.

As far as I know, the segwit is a transaction maleability fix. The blocksize increase is just a side-effect. 


No data is removed. Signatures are just stuffed in a new structure appended to the regular 1MB block. For a full node to operate correctly, one still needs to download it, verify it and store it.

It's possible (although you still need to download them and verify them), but if everyone did that, no new nodes could bootstrap in a trust-less way. At least unless some other mechanism such as reasonably cheap zero knowledge proofs are implemented to verify the pruned signatures or even whole blocks.
I can imagine a researcher who run a node only to analyze the transaction graph would want to remove the signatures after the verification to make the dataset smaller, but that's pretty narrow use case.

Each new block refer to the previous one all the way back to the genesis block, which is hard-coded in the client.
If you change a block somewhere in the middle, you'd have to replace every block mined after that to convince the rest of the network to switch to your chain.
Your new chain would also have to have a combined difficulty equal or higher then the one you're trying to replace. So you can't just mine gazillion of low difficulty blocks to fool anyone (except SPV clients, but let's not focus on this right now)

This is a risk only if the majority of significant economic actors decides to accept a block with segwit signatures missing.
I see no long term benefit to any exchange, merchant, or even regular user (assuming he runs a full node) to accept such block no matter how long the "invalid" chain is.
There is only a theoretical advantage to do that as a miner. I as a miner might think that the previous block founder is temporarily withholding the witness data and will release it later on, so I might as well start building on that "not valid yet" chain. This is a same thing as SPV mining. But as long as there are enough (economically significant) non-mining nodes verifying the blocks this attack is not feasible.

@_date: 2013-10-23 12:38:33
This is not possible.
When you are creating the transaction, you have to use all bitcoins from selected previous outputs. If you have let's say 8 bitcoins on address ABC and transfer just 4 to address XYZ, remaining 4 BTC would be considered a transaction fee and assigned to miner of the next block. Even if you implement fund-locking feature allowing the remaining balance to stay on original address, most of the wallets consist of hundreds of keys which is making the whole thing even more complicated.
Adding feature like this would require non-trivial change of protocol.
You can always keep you hoarding address private, create a fake address with few cents worth of bitcoins on it and in case of an attacker threatening you, reveal the second key to him.

Not entirely true. Every node has ability to rebroadcast or not to rebroadcast the transaction based on how high fee is attached to it. In the end, It's the miner who decides if it will be included in block, but by sending a transaction without a propper fee, you are risking that it will never actually arrive to any miner.
As someone said before, the new rules with dynamic standard fees are being worked on right now. Static fee settings is just temporary solution until the new model is finished.

It's obvious that non-bitcoin clients relying on some 3rd party centralized service can be used as a workaround, but when it comes to bridgewalker it's not THE solution.
In case of blockchain.info, the clients are at least in possession of private keys. In case of bridgewalker, clients have nothing but hope that somebody will hold the value for them.
I can't tell someone about advantages of Bitcoin and recommend the app taking away all of them at the same time. Even when it removes the risk of volatility.

No, your wallet is unaffected by blochchain reindexing. Simple explanation of what happened: bitcoin-qt 0.7.x was storing the blocks in barkley db format. Bitcoin-qt 0.8.x  is using level db. Therefore all blocks need to be copied from the old db to the new one.  According to what you have described, this process is stucked for some reason. Try to restart bitcoin wallet if it happens. If restart does not help, remove everything from the data directory except your wallet.dat (when you are there, make a few backup copies of it) and start the bitcoin client again. It will download the blocks again instead of readin them from the old db, which is not an issue if you have decent dsl internet connection, because most of the hard work slowing things down is verifying the transaction in blocks. Not the download speed.

Imagine it's a magic car. It will only start it's engine if you prove you own a special colored coin. These special cars, houses and other things are also called "smart property".
Trading a smart property represented by colored coins for regular bitcoins can be made securely without 3rd party escrow by transferring colored coin (representing a car ownership) from person A to B, while transferring bitcoins from B to A in the same transaction. If one of the signatures (from buyer or seller) is missing, the transaction is not executed at all.
I don't like the idea of smart property personally, because it implies usage of DRM. But it's an interesting idea, and colored coins can still be used to trade company stocks or other private currencies.

It's saved in your download folder. You can just copy it to new device and import it. As long as you are not creating new receiving addresses by yourself, you don't need to make a backups after every X transactions unlike the bitcoin-qt. Make sure you password protect your backup every time! Other apps on your phone has access to your sdcard or internal storage as well.
Also remember that if you import your backup to other device, you need to make a new backup just after that. That's because the wallet app will send the change to the new address that was created before import when you make a new transaction.

The reason why it's hard to earn easy money these days is because:
* Miners are willing to pay more money for the hardware than it will mine back in it's lifetime because:
 * They have access to "free" electricity
 * Order was already placed months ago and there is no point in canceling it (paid with BTC for example)
 * Their have just discovered the bitcoin mining and rushed to buy any overpriced HW they can, without doing any calculations.
* Manufacturers are selling non-existing HW. You cannot estimate a difficulty increase at all if you don't know how may people are still waiting for their pre-ordered HW to arrive. Some decided to risk it. Therefore only those who are at the beginning of the current gen HW pre-order queue will make a profit.
I hope this will settle as soon as the pre-order madnes ends (if ever) or/and when we hit the physical barriers of the chip manufacturing processes.

this + deflation = much more expensive loans. And I mean much much more expensive.
Considering that I guess some business practices would have to change radically compared to debt-based economy, but otherwise business as usual.

This is weird. I have been thinking about this address few hours ago with no apparent reason. Can't believe it's finally empty.

He can't use Coinbase for exchange, and using it as online wallet is not the brightest idea.

Well... However ridiculous this idea may sound, it's not so bad. Not so bad at all  :D

This is related to default fee policy. Merchant should refuse to accept immature outputs spent without fee. But we need some kind of standard to calculate proper fee. This is planned for 0.9. We also need bitcoin-qt to act as SPV node.

Deterministic wallet is important feature. I have just read another post from a guy who failed to figure out how to backup a wallet. Go, BIP 0032!

Your (lower difficulty) block is invalid even if you have &gt;90% of hashing power, unless all (significant part of) non-mining clients also agree with your new rules.

You will be shown a seed as a part of the inicialization process. You can regenerate the whole wallet using the seed. 
Also there will be option to turn on something like captcha, so if the device is lost, the password cannot be easily bruteforced.
Meanwhile you can restore the seed on some other device or software wallet.

This! I had many issues with USB block erupters. They were running fine on my power hungry desktop PC with cgminer, but refused to work on any other machine. As a last resort, I tried bfgminer. They are working since then.

Well, Amir started really really good. but killed it right after the beggining with the unlicensed stock exchange and the jail :P

I think the seed generation algorithm is the same Electrum is using. So if you loose the Trezor, you can just download Electrum client and restore the wallet from seed.
