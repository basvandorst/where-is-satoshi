You have a great dad! bitcoins is rising nowadays as you know. analysts are seeing that it will rise more in the next years to come. It is a good time to invest now. You can buy a small amount of BTC thru Paxful or similar sites that use an escrow so you'll be safe. I suggest you buy small amount 1 at a time. because it is risky if you buy all of them at 1 time.
