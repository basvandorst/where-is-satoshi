Out of interest, why can't you use Coinbase? They support a lot of European countries, don't they?

Oh, that sucks, I simply had a small "+" button which allowed me to walk through the steps on the phone. My bad, I thought you hadn't seen the support issue.
I have seen people from Coinbase reaching out directly to redditors (i.e. first comment here  maybe you could contact them that way, from what I've read their response time is quite a lot quicker. That's if you still want to use Coinbase of course.

Hmm, that's simply not true. I had the same issue so I went to Coinbase's support and found that you can use their iOS or Android app to take a picture of your ID/Driver's license. Check out the fourth item under "Troubleshooting" at

Agreed, their website even says (in Dutch) "By day trading we can guarantee a profit each day (up to 10%)". This person is in no way furthering the image of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.

The liberating part of Bitcoin is not that everyone can start from the same point (i.e. with as many bitcoins), you will always have early adopters who become very wealthy with whatever new financial system is devised. The liberating part of Bitcoin is that ANYONE can partake in the financial system, there is no central authority to deny you access to it like banks can do now, and in that regard it is a very legitimate replace for fiat.
