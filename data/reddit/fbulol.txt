I just assumed this would be about dark net markets lol

Does it give a bad image to btc if I say I use it to access high quality LSD and MDMA safely that I wouldn't otherwise have access to locally (much less if it was real and not a more dangerous nbome or methylone)?

Hehe is this about that circle thread? I'm glad that guys issue got solved but I'm still still salty they haven't upped my limit after having a 1000 limit for months. q: 
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:13:12
Consider yourself lucky, I've been a member for months and had my limit upped from 100 to 500 to 1000 and now it's back down to 300. I reached out to them last week because I trade a lot and the new limit immediately fucked me up.
Just today they get back to me (after I emailed them again today saying how someone on reddit got it in a day) and got this response:








Meh. Idk what they're judging by because I frequently met that 1k limit a week and if not at least 500-700. Oh well time to supplement with another service.

Right before SR went down, the account that my whole family used was a bit over $10,000 spent. X.X I soo wish I took a pic, wasn't expecting it to get pinched so soon ):
At least we're contributing to the growth of btc!

One time at a rave, I wore a BTC shirt and many many people sparked up a conversation about it. I wonder why, lol
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:52:14

@_date: 2013-11-29 19:02:23


I'd argue that BTC are waaaaaay better than cash to buy drugs too q:
