Hell yeah! Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:08:54
What is the best way you can prove you’re telling the truth?
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:13:29
If my coin is on BRD wallet is it mine? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:28:31
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:55:37
Thanks. It seems very reliable.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:14:19
You’ll be living in a sewer system soon with a BTC tattoo on the middle of your forehead, crawling on all fours trying to kill rats for food. Just kidding good luck
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:11:00
You could and probably have received cash from illicit activities. Not your fault if you can't have any idea about it.
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:20:16
86,000 divided by current price then times 100
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:40:17
How so?
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:10:36
Would systems like this be price catalysts to da moooooonnn
@_date: 2019-11-12 04:03:32
I should have worded that better very nice
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:46:01
That’s ridiculous man. Who cares? Money over matter
@_date: 2019-11-14 20:12:57
Because women aren’t GENERALLY very interested in investing or nerd stuff
@_date: 2019-11-12 04:15:21
Maybe it’s not very well known yet, and we also don’t know when Lolli presumably bought the BTC that they are “rewarding.” A lot of factors play into it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:00:26
You may enjoy storing it on Bread wallet (BRD).
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:40:56
It’s not change, it’s rewards for buying product.

Mercedes-Benz stadium is cashless.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:55:14
Just use Gemini or coinbase and send it to a private wallet ASAP
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:22:11
Did you know that AT&amp;T accepts bitcoin as payment? Did you know English Premier League club Watford recently added a sleeve ad for Bitcoin? Mainstream is coming. It's still early to invest.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:46:13
Don’t forget BTC can be forked in the future to protect against a hack like this.
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:17:48
The pressure to sell, even at as low as current ATH of ~$20k, is going to be immense. How do predictors of these astronomical prices look past that?
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:34:49
Thanks. I want to raise awareness.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:37:37
@_date: 2019-10-10 20:22:50
Of course. Depends on what his home currency is thiugh
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:03:10
You write down your keys (12 word passphrase randomly generated) and store them in a safe place. Download BRD on new device and restore wallet using keys.
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:54:39
If you’re in bitcoin because you think it will be the main currency then how is that not the same as trying to get rich from it? You believe you’ll be ahead of the game when it becomes the main currency and you’ll be wealthy.
@_date: 2019-10-10 19:50:41
How much are you up then?
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:10:41
At least download BRD bread wallet and send it there from Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:59:20
What do you mean by 12 seconds?
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:34:19
I’m not sure how you don’t understand people’s desire to get rich. 
That being said, I know what you’re saying. Bitcoin has the potential to be the hardest form of money there has ever been. All it’s missing at the moment is the level of adoption that fiat currencies have. Perhaps in time bitcoin and fiat will swap places in terms of adoption. But my thought is, if you’ve already made $4 million gain on an investment, unless you are filthy rich, I think you’d have to be insane not to take the money and run rather than hope your investment trades places with the world’s main form of money.
@_date: 2019-10-10 19:40:01
how much did you profit?
@_date: 2019-10-10 20:10:02
Why not sell? Seems a bit greedy. Also really speaks to your faith in future prospects for the price on the other hand. No offense just curious
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:55:49
Nobody knows man. If you need the money then get out and if you don't then see what happens in 2020 because who knows what the halving will bring.

Miami seems to be an accepting place for Bitcoin what with the Dolphins using it for 50/50 raffles and now the airport.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:56:42
Send off Coinbase to Bread wallet (BRD). Beautiful app
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:49:56
The Bitcoin Standard is a good read on the history of money and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:36:43
Big news!
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:24:50
Is it not safe enough to secure an image of this recovery phrase on my phone?
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:01:30
So the buy function on BRD would do what?
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:41:31
Thanks. So when I want to sell my coin for USD I would then send it back to Coinbase from Bread?
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:33:53
Should I use bread wallet or something similar to send my coin off of Coinbase? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:45:04
Last question sorry man... is there a good reason why I shouldn’t just buy my BTC through BRD instead of Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-01-30 20:01:36
Thank you so much for helping a newb. Is the transfer from Coinbase to a wallet nearly instantaneous and Vice versa?
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:59:56
Yeah and a wife could throw this away at any moment and without a care.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:58:31
This is fantastic! Watford’s site even has educational material: 
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:42:21
Bitcoin is the only crypto that is worth anything as a reliable store of value. All the others are copycats of bitcoin that can not be trusted to not be manipulated by their creators.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:59:48
Simple yet excellent investment advice
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:19:55
It says that WCX is forbidden in the USA.
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:08:07
I feel in my gut that this year or next we will see a major retail chain accepting bitcoin. I.e McDonald’s or Starbucks or something of the like
