That was beautiful! Now I'm all hyped!

This is already being done but for an alt coin called TimeKoin, pretty interesting take.

Bahahahaha nope!

You should read more into it, because it clearly shows you don't understand it

You can say that if you want lol, if you wish to stay ignorant go ahead I won't stop you.

Would sidechains allow it to become a multi-algo coin? I'm guessing not as that does require a big fork. I'm glad to be proven other wise and learn more about these sidechains.

Yes it is, it obtains 5 proof of work algorithms, Scrypt, SHA256, Skein, Qubit and Groestl

It be cool(I know it won't happen) if Bitcoin switch to a multi algo, like Myriadcoin, which makes it extremely hard to obtain 51% due to the attacker obtaining control of three algos at the same time
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:19:37
A way better approach would be multi-algo like Myriadcoin, it makes it hard to obtain 51%
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:29:59
Lol you don't really understand how it works. Myriadcoin's blockchain is divided into 5 parts, each part belongs to a different algorithm.

Wow what a great idea! Definitely going to start using this website to buy things from amazon.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:17:19
Myriadcoin has huge potential as it's the first currency to use multi algo approach which solves 51% attacks as they're hard to do and is friendly to any miner.

"I heard they raised the prices and they're not selling them for 32 bits anymore, but 64 bits! WTF! Why would they do that?" :P
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:12:52
You should look into Myriadcoin, as it has 5 algorithms which make it harder to a 51% attack since the attacker has to obtain 51% on three algorithms which is pretty darn hard to do.

Can you do multi-proof-of-work on sidechains? I don't think so, can you?
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:15:45
I've been away for a month what happened?
@_date: 2015-10-19 08:39:25
It's worked fine for me, the only problem I've encountered is that when I tried to withdraw Fiat and confirmed it, nothing happened.

You should post this also in
