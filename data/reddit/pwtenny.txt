Capital controls are already in effect in Cyprus. They aren't moving money anywhere, and there's a chance they'll ditch the Euro as well. You're wasting your time. That country is heading for a depression. The story is going to be unnecessary human suffering, not Bitcoin.

It's a bunch of people with no idea what they've been doing over the past three months *very* slowly coming to realize that a currency/commodity/market with no regulations, no oversight, no rules of any kind.... kind of sucks.
That's what's happening.
Big traders and speculators are using leverage to push things in a direction that benefits them and they are doing it repeatedly. They are called market makers. They are regulated out in the real world, but everybody thought having a market with nobody owning and controlling it would be just soooo coooool. It pushed all the right buttons for some, but few of those people have a lick of common sense otherwise.
Unless the MMs decide to leave, Bitcoin is going to be like this forever.
What people need to do is start thinking about the next Bitcoin, the version that addresses all the flaws that this has. And it has quite a few.
If people think this sucks, wait until the real cons move in the way the traders have. Or wait until the total currency limit has been reached and most of the miners bail, and attacking the network becomes much easier.

The value of the dollar won't fall without inflation, and we're not having inflation because of suppressed demand. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) closed at 82.79 and it was about 71 before the recession began. The lowest it's been since 2008 was ~72 or so in the middle of 2011. In other words the dollar is worth more now than it was before the recession. It's not "worth less and less every day", it's worth more and more. You've got it completely backwards, just FYI.

There's nowhere near enough liquidity for that.

It's exactly like a financial instrument: a commodity contract. If someone wanted to, they could accept an oil futures contract as payment instead of USD. BTC is no different than that.
It's an extremely volatile commodity with virtually nothing underpinning its value other than speculation.

It's possible that it could go on for years. The housing bubble did. Someone has to figure out what the mechanics are.
There are two basic rules that I can fathom that will determine the outcome of a commodity bubble. The first is the fixed point beyond which only traders and speculators can afford to buy the commodity in meaningful quantities that can benefit from appreciation.
Beyond that point, the price will only rise marginally or not at all because few people will be able to afford quantities that will be valuable for that reason. Although BTC can be divided down to the eight decimal place, having very small amounts can't benefit from these large value increases. It's unlikely that non-traders/speculators will ever be priced out of using Bitcoin entirely, but eventually they'll be priced out of benefiting from this bubble.
Once that happens I think the speculators are going to liquidate, followed quickly by the traders, and then the investors, causing a crash.
The second rule concerns how low that crash will go. It may only fall far enough for traders to bet on a recovery, so they'll set a buy point and once they find it, their purchases will stop the fall and either establish a new normal at that price, or they'll cause another bubble. Another bubble will lure the speculators back in and the cycle will repeat. A new normal will not.
If that doesn't happen, Bitcoin will fall to what I've argued is its intrinsic value. The intrinsic value is the point at which Bitcoin is more valuable as a worldwide digital currency than its competitors are, mainly Paypal. (Note that if BTC reaches $600 USD, the 0.0005 BTC fee that it takes to get many transactions into a block will be 30 cents, the flat minimum of a Paypal business transaction before the 2.9% minimum.)
If I'm right, anyone with audit control over Mt Gox should be able to tell when the bubble is about to pop by identifying and monitoring the activity of the speculators. If the value of BTC flattens out and they stop buying, the bubble will pop within days. Perhaps hours.
Since Bitcoin is only owner-anonymous and not transaction-anonymous, it might be possible to figure out who the speculators are by analyzing the entire blockchain going back March 5th or March 18th, if they aren't buying into new wallets every time.
I don't think anything short of very serious data gathering and analysis will tell you when this bubble will pop and anyone that says for sure that it's not going to doesn't know what they're talking about.
But I do think it's possible.
There's far less data available here than there was with the housing market and not having Bitcoin underpinned by anything other than speculation will make it very difficult to forecast. So many people think this not being a fiat currency is a benefit, but it's not. It's why it's so dangerous. You can get a pretty good idea of what the Dollar and Euro are going to do by looking at government policy and mountains of economic data, things that aren't available here. But figuring out who the big players are by analyzing transactions and then using those wallets as indicators could provide some much needed insight into these volatile fluctuations.
I think something that would help stabilize things would have been making Bitcoin more like a stock than a currency. The idea as I understand it is because the currency can go down to 0.00000001, it supposedly doesn't matter if 1 BTC = $1,000.00 USD. You can still get the amount you need. If you need $5 worth, you can get 0.005 BTC and do your business. But owning 0.005 BTC when it's 1000:1 means a $25 increase (1000 to 1025) in a day will only benefit people with hundreds of BTC, not you and your $5. That 2.43% increase will result in a $12,500 profit for someone who owns 500 BTC, but only a 12.5 cent profit for you.
That keeps Bitcoin functional as a currency, but makes it useless as a financial instrument for anyone other than the biggest investors.
A better idea would have been to build in something akin to a stock split. Warren Buffet's firm, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) closed down $430.00 today, but that was only a 0.27% decline, because that stock is going for $157,570.00 per share. Most people are priced out of that stock, which is why a lot of companies will split when the value gets too high. The value halves and the number of shares you own doubles. It would be better for everyone if Bitcoin halved at $100 instead of possibly chasing the stars. It'd go from $100 to $50, but you'd instantly own twice as many coins. It would be even better if the reverse also happened if the price dipped too low.
Because of all of that, anyone dreaming of BTC hitting $1,000 USD or more should consider the repercussions of dealing with an infantile (no offense) commodity that has few meaningful rules for how it should behave. I don't imagine that many people would want to live in a universe where the laws of physics no longer applied. A lack of structure isn't always a good thing, in other words. And anyone that hasn't considered this stuff (and more) but has already sunk a significant chunk of money into Bitcoin isn't investing, they are gambling.
Anyone who hasn't discovered the rules and written the book on this is gambling.
If someone wants to make money, they need to be the Newton of their age and come to understand exactly what is happening and why. If this reddit is any indication, nobody has the slightest clue yet.
And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go post this on Tumblr. :p

Nothing. You all wanted an unregulated market with no rules. And you got one. Enjoy.

"New Zealanders should move their savings to bitcoins ASAP"
Absolutely not. Something that I don't think people are getting is that Bitcoin has no floor.
Gold is a good hedge because even if it falls in value, it'll never fall through the floor unless someone invents a way to make perfect synthetic gold. Gold has industrial applications and it is scarce, which means it will always be valuable to a degree. You'll not see gold at $1/pound in your lifetime.
A country's currency is close to that, supported by the creditworthiness of its government and its (simplified) economic output. Like synthetic gold, a country's currency won't hit the floor unless something drastic happens to either its government or economy. The dollar may fall, but you won't see it worthless.
The value of both may fluctuate up and down, sometimes wildly, but neither can just crater out of the blue. Bitcoin can because it doesn't have that inherent security. It's more like a stock than a currency. $5 today, $500 tomorrow, kicked off the exchange and trading for pennies next week.
The exchange rate was around $5:1 BTC not two and a half months ago, and now it's $59:1. People should consider the possibility that Bitcoin is experiencing a bubble, which means it could fall much further and much quicker than its recent rise. Even if it's not a bubble, because it has nothing holding it up, it could still fall quickly and brutally for almost no reason at all.
There's a story out there about a guy that paid 10,000 BTC for a couple of pizzas back in 2010, which would be worth around $590,000 today. It could easily be worth just a couple of pizzas again by summer.
If people want to protect their savings, they should move them to a banking system with more favorable terms and laws than their own. There are plenty out there. BTC is not suitable for that. It is extremely dangerous for that.

That's a pretty big accusation. Where's your proof?
@_date: 2013-03-20 12:13:24
Investments offered by credit unions or their equivalent in other countries are probably the safest place that's still a usable part of the global financial system. Forget what the media or politicians say, U.S. government debt is still the safest in the world if you can get it.
With really low interest rates in safe places, people aren't going to make anything on their savings right now anyway.
Call me nuts, but if push came to shove, U.S. debt stashed away in a safe deposit box in a community bank that's not in distress is probably as safe as you can get without staffing cash under a mattress. Not that I advocate that.
I was thinking along the lines of having someone research the issue to find a country with a reasonably stable economy and government with banking laws liberal enough to allow outside investment, and just move your savings there. But it's a gamble no matter what you do. That's what people don't understand. There is no where you can put money where it's not at risk, and Bitcoin is probably the *most* risky of them all.

Over the past 30 days there have been no dips on the weekend except two days ago: 
March 16-17 no dip. March 9-10 the price went up. March 2-3 no dip. Feb 23-24 no dip. The big drops on that graph are March 6-7 which is a Wednesday and Thursday, early on the 12th which was a Tuesday, and 22-23 which was a Friday and Saturday.
No pattern there for mini-crashes and weekends appear more stable than the business week.
Advice to newcomers should be: don't go near Bitcoin right now.

Anyway, good luck with whatever choice you make.

The lag at MtGox isn't why the value keeps crashing. Crashes like that still happen on the US stock market where trade latency is measured in milliseconds, if you can afford the access.
All the exchanges would have to collude to institute trading restrictions to "fix" this and all it would take to upset that is to create an exchange that doesn't play by the rules. Pro traders themselves could do that.
If you think non-traders all congregating on sites with these new restrictions would work, well, it won't, because those exchanges will have BTC values far below those where the traders are playing. You'd probably see BTC below $10 on the safe exchanges and sky high on trader friendly exchanges.
Which is what you'd expect. It's a classic risk versus reward calculation in traditional finance. High volatility means high risk and high reward. Low volatility means low risk and low reward.
A safe exchange might have 1 BTC @ $10, but it might only move less than a dollar per day. It'll be great as a currency and junk as a  trading opportunity. A trader exchange is where you'll have 1 BTC @ $250, but it'll move wildly hour-to-hour and be useless as a currency.
People who want the glory of a sky high commodity/currency will have to swim with the sharks.

Suppressed demand is not the same thing as demand "staying the same." Demand is increasing slowly as new people enter the labor force and GDP increases. It's suppressed in that GDP is below potential because of high unemployment. You only get inflation (and higher interest rates) with an expansion of the monetary base when GDP is at potential (4% unemployment).
As for gas and milk, both are subject to fluctuations in energy prices which are detached from CPI to get what's called core inflation. Food prices go up when gas prices go up because of transportation costs, while gas prices go up because of changes in the price of oil which can be caused by anything from speculation by investors to a shortage in refining capacity, or even wars. So you usually exclude food and fuel.
Once you do that, you see that inflation is not a problem here.

News of the deposit levy broke on March 16th when BTC was around $47 USD. Cypriot banks closed on the 16th and didn't reopen until the 28th.
BTC didn't move off that price point until early on the 18th, the day the Cypriot parliament voted (initially) against the levy.
If BTC moved because of Cyprus, it was pure speculation from foreigners, because those people were shut down for 12 straight days while BTC initially laid on its belly, then moved from $47 to about $98 when the banks re-opened.
It wasn't Cyprus.

Nope. The banks bought themselves the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005 which makes it much harder to get a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 wipes out your debt and you lose some property. Chapter 13, which is what a lot of people are now forced into it thanks to that legislation, makes you lose property and sets up a five year repayment plan before the debt goes away.
What's amazing is that three years later all those banks that forced significantly worse bankruptcy law on consumers by buying off politicians ended up getting virtually free (to them) bailouts on our dollar from those same politicians.
BTC can't be seized, but your car can be. Your house can. Your paycheck can. I wouldn't be at all surprised if the court can order you to transfer the Bitcoins to the creditors. I think that's common in civil judgments for people who try to hide assets. Ignore the order and you go to prison.
Forget this crap, folks. Don't be a con. Don't be just like the bank industry that you're trying to get away from by screwing other people out of their money because you want a free ride.

Yeah, it's a pretty obvious bubble. Most of the people who suddenly want to get in on this are as ill equipped to understand what they're getting into as they would be trying to buy derivatives on Wall Street. Maybe less so, because this is so much more approachable and at a glance seems easy to understand.
What people should be doing is buying a little bit now so they have the infrastructure in place to buy a lot later, at a moments notice, after the bubble bursts.

**tsmc**, I'm talking about Bitcoin period.
**blueappal**, There are obvious competency problems with many of the exchanges, but they aren't the problem. One could argue that Bitcoin isn't the problem either despite it's many flaws. Rather, a lot of people messing around with something they don't understand is the problem.
People see Bitcoin as a free (as in lacking control) currency, which it's not. It's an unconstrained single commodity market, which is a really awful thing. It's why financial markets are usually strictly regulated and why they tend to explode in your face when they aren't.
What happened yesterday to Bitcoin is what would happen every single day on every stock market in the world if they weren't already as regulated as they are. There's a reason pump and dump schemes are illegal. There's a reason why the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has an entire division dedicated to market makers.
People are playing with Bitcoin like its a toy while real finance sharks are slowing moving in. Of course it's going to be havoc. And yes, to a degree this is exactly what Bitcoin was designed to allow. People were celebrating the wild west nature of Bitcoin a month ago when it benefited them, but I bet they aren't so hot on it now.
