yeah but you gotta track of exchange rate each time you convert to fiat and pay for something (even when you pay w bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:42:24
Interesting. Thanks for the insight

ikr no love in this community :'(
as a side note, do you think we'll ever get to an age where homeless people start accepting bitcoin? I guess it's possible where they put out their public address on a cardboard lol

I’m gonna hold mine and pass it to my grandkids.

If you put your email into it maybe try searching “bitcoin” in your email search bar?

I’ll promise to sell you ice cream for $5. 
Scenario 1: ice cream price goes up to $10. I lose $5 cuz I have to pay $5 extra to meet the terms of my promise. 
Scenario 2: ice cream price goes down to $2. I make $3 since I only spent $2 to buy that ice cream at market price then sold it to you for $5
Original answer: It’s a contract that says an investor will pay for a certain asset at a certain price in the future. 
So you can have
1) A future contract for 2019 that says an investor will buy bitcoin for you at $1,000
2) Or you can have another futures contract for 2019 that says the investor will buy bitcoin for you at $100,000
If the price of bitcoin goes up to $500,000 then the latter investor gets $400k in profit while the former loses $499,000
It’s gambling on an asset without actually holding that asset.

Definitely not a big enough reason to crash the market...

Yes don’t be a shill. Just mention it here and there. You never want to be responsible for someone’s investments going bad
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:11:16
The thing is is that if a lot of people sell in January the price will go down. 
If a lot of people buy the price will go up. 
It’s as simple as that
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:42:01
Hahahaha Hahahah nice one mate 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:22:55
You can give me bitcoin tho ����
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:10:36
I don’t think they would hardfork off bitcoin. Bitcoin was built off old architecture (POW, very difficult to scale). If there’s a new coin that would take over it would probably be created from the ground up
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:10:04
Hahahah technology, so disruptive ain’t it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:17:49
That’s just the way the program was written. It’s mathematically impossible to have more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:34:30
Forking doesn’t mean the number of bitcoins you own splits. 
Let’s say you have 4 bitcoins and some shit company like bcash decides to fork off the main bitcoin branch to steal all the marketing bitcoin has. Now youll babe the same number of coins for each. So 4 bitcoins and 4 shitty bcash coins. 
If you want to guarantee your bitcoins are safe, make yourself a paper wallet. Only then you’ll be able to sleep well at night.

How much do you make, how much do you have in your savings? Shouldn’t gamble more than 10% of your earnings into something as high risk as bitcoin says mark cuban
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:31:06
Should go buy your uncle a nice gift with that $100
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:55:12
I saw some chart and it’s apparently too 10% only... 2.1 bitcoin club? 21 bitcoin club???
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:06:42
Hahahahaha that’d be nice.....wishful dreaming
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:02:02
Then yeah probably just download a paper wallet and lock it up. Don’t do any emotional day trading lol

Think about the dollars gained to time spent checking bitcoin price ratio. If it’s too low then not worth it.
How many times will you be checking your phone for bitcoin price if you invest 0.02btc?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:19:30
Lol can you put them on the same scale plz
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:22:14
Don’t do it. If it goes up you’ll resent yourself for giving it to them. If it goes down they’ll resent you. 
Also not nice to entice others to start gambling (uncle joe may then start trading crypto and lose all his moneys).

It won’t really. There is some FUD going around about people on Wall Street pumping bitcoin so that they can short it, then dump all their btc holdings.

First rule of investing: never try to time the market
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:55:07
Great question. Basically what it comes down to is that the US wants to have oil traded by the US dollar. This gives the dollar more backing than other foreign currencies, as it can be thought of as a global currency. 
There was a great video explaining how Iraq was about to trade their oil in euros back in 2000 which threatened to devalue the USD. That of course sparked our military to take off and start a buncha wars to secure our global wealth. 
I’m def not an expert on this topic so try googling “petrodollar” to learn more. 
EDIT: found video

Not a good idea. If it goes up a ton you’ll regret giving it to them. If it goes down a ton they’ll regret receiving them.
