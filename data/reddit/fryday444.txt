Santa or Jesus. Holy crap dude. Some day I hope I have enough money to spread around. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:21:45
How's that? I can send money using Electrum. How is that any different than sending money using an online service?

You don't have to pay tax on bitcoins you buy and don't spend. Unless you are talking about whatever assets you sell to buy the coins in the first place.

Yeah, traded by BCH for BTC at the peak a bit ago. Hope it pays off :D

Congratulations, but if you live in the US, please make sure you properly handle taxes. You don't want to end up in debt again!

Not only bought in the dip, but cashed out my other-bitcoin at it's peak to make the purchase.

Did you read from your own link?










It's never been mentioned that such an agreement exists.

Don't care one way or the other, but even what she describes IS plagiarism. Plagiarism is just "the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own". Permission is irrelevant.
