I don't have kids but I'm in my early 20s and I have stopped smoking weed so I can save money to invest in BTC as well. I feel so much better about life in general. I hope things work out for us!

I love bitcoin!

How do you guys think this will affect the prices of the various altcoins?

Hey Man, I too just kinda started out with Bitcoin. 
Well you don't need to necessarily invest in terms of money. Opening up a BTC wallet is free for the most part. You can open up a BTC wallet on coinbase.com. That's where I started. Now coinbase will take some transaction fees when it comes to transferring funds from your bank account to your wallet but that's about it.
You can start off with a just a bit of money. I invested just $5 USD. Just watch the market...the interface is really simple on coinbase.com
I would look for a guy on Youtube called Crypto Don. He taught me everything when it comes to day trading the cryptocurrencies.

I don't buy them unless you consider XRP a shitcoin

I just didn't understand because I don't have a hardware wallet. I guess if I get one I'll see since I never owned a private key.

sorry for the miscommunication I said afford but I don't have the active desire or "need" to buy shitcoins
