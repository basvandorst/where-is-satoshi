Patience my friend it will all work out in the end!
Crypto is high risk  high reward.
You should at minimum get your coins bk if they don't honour the trade.
That's the thing when we use these third party exchange we have to  just pray everything works out and we have to trust them blindly that's what I don't like but like I said before.
High risk high reward!
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:41:50

@_date: 2017-09-15 19:17:13
Me too my friend , to tell you the truth  im a little relived I bought 0.72 btc at 4.3k usd and sold at 3.3k usd overall I took about a $900 doller loss but I can live with that because I rather take a $900 loss than a 4k loss I will see the market if it dips back at about say 2k to 2.5k I will but back in, but I reckon with all that's going on it could slip even back to the 1k Mark.
Time will tell but it's a rollercoaster ride I could not afford to lose the whole 4k.
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:27:51
Fucking loved it mate!  beautiful post so true. 
Long  live bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:35:08
I feel your pain dude same happened to me, I live in london and have had my money seized by police over  £2090 in cash it's been three years and now there telling me  you cant have your money back but  the  money  has been accidently forfeited under some other persons name they said we made a mistake and now you have to appeal to the high court to get the case reopened I don't understand none of it, basically there saying your money got mixed up with some random criminals money and we seized it and now you not us! But you have to go to the high court spend money on lawyers and ask for a judicial review and get the case reopend. I have already jumped through hoops to get my money back to no avail. These people are legal gangsters criminals who stole my money i am enraged I can't do anything.
I hate the fuckin system fuck the system and fuck there laws

I was stopped in my Porsche cayenne suv I was dressed smartly I even had a my bank statement on me were I drew the money showing, but they said due to a a conviction I had for a offence many years ago ( fraud ) the will be confiscating money to check for money laundering nothing came back then they told me they have mixed up my money ( god knows how ) and now I have to go to the high court to ask for a judicial review and I have to go through all the hoops.
I say fuck there laws and there system they governments are nothing but oppressors and real criminals 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:44:09
It's a big trap trap get out now even if u take a small few hundred doller loss, buy back when it hits under 2k with all this fud n bad news coming out it's not stable

Lmfao ha ha u guys crack me up 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:48:35
Well its just going crazy right now it can go any way but just too too much negativety being thrown at it, for the guys who bought say between 3.8k &amp; 5k there better taking a loss now and see what happens before it dips way under 2.5k it's just my opinion it's not law by the way.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:32:54
Lmfao 
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:46:48

Gdax does not charge fees for withdrawal so don't know what happened to you
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:33:25
I really hope your right my Freind I really hope it right, that was my plan inatially, but I made a mistake rather than buy slowly I bought 0.75 btc with 3 weeks I should have bought it slowly then it would not have missed my large chunks off money I still believe in bitcoin all the way I'm just gonna have to change my buying strategy that's all I will buy again but this time slowly maybe 300$ at a time.
May I meet you at the moon who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:50:38
Why is it always you trying to create FUD if you don't believe in bitcoin why u even here?
Look at this guys previous post he is always creating FUD!
So many people have already become rich in tradi g bitcoin and all the holders will surely in there near future have a big payday
And for you your a fool who maybe had no money to invest and is very bitter towards bitcoiners I rest my case.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:06:09

He wants cheap coins he does not want to pay 10-12% atm fees.
Atm are goid for small amounts if u need them quick and have no access to debit/credit card 
Your better off buying them off coin base for 3% on card payments rather then use atm
