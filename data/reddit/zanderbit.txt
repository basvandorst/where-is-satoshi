Yeah I would be interested in that

It was designed by Steve Jobs for Tim Cook.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:17:27
Great idea! I might actually adapt this and use it for a business venture of mine.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:21:50
Already scanned and changed passwords. She is clean. They must have gotten it some other way.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:14:20
Agreed. Read what I responded with.
Basically, again relating Bitcoin to Gold.... A few companies within the Gold investment industry are definitely Ponzi schemes. That doesn't mean Gold in general is a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:55:33
Nope, didn't know Mintpal had it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 20:16:00
That is awesome Charlie. Is the quality good? Do you feel like your actually there? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:17:01
Don't worry, $552 is still a really low price. Don't do anything irrational, just hold onto them. Over the next month or so the price should recover to around $800. Over the next 6-7 months they will gain value tremendously. 10x gain most likely.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:24:57
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:07:57
THIS. Exactly how I am right now.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:02:00
Yes, I am not sure of his exact comments but he didn't understand it at all, and so he didn't invest. Warren basically invests only in companies that offer goods and services that will not go out of style for a very long time. Clothes, Food, Insurance. Things like these are where Warren banks his money.
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:18:47
Tell me you got the joke...
@_date: 2014-08-10 02:31:56
FAIL! :)
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:41:08
No, but now you have me curious about this.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:22:13
Never used it... Love the idea though.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:17:01
Same here
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:22:46
That is all they care about is the for sure money...
@_date: 2014-08-29 19:14:46
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:50:43
Come on guys, quit stabbing at shadows in the dark. Satoshi once wrote that Private Keys should never be deleted. I'd almost stake my life on the fact that they are still accessible by Bitcoin's God Satoshi. 
He saw a financial revolution brewing that normal people couldn't and still to this day can't fathom. The average person doesn't know jack shit about the financial system, let alone enough information that would lead to a well  thought out opinion. 
Satoshi of all people would not destroy his revolution. Bitcoin is literally his/their child.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:33:52
Nice catch!
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:06:23
You should. He is right... The blockchain is there for all to see. There is no hiding. We will find the coins one day. Or at least find out what happened to them. 
Can't do anything or find anything out because all of the information is being kept from us, most likely under a government gag order or more stuff would leak...
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:21:47
Nobody knows for sure, it just seems the most likely based on the amounts we are talking about here. 700 some thousand Bitcoins is not a drop in the bucket!
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:10:28
Haha! Touche.
@_date: 2014-06-03 05:40:39
Yeah, Coinbase is absent.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:21:15
Agreed. I didn't even know Mintpal had 2FA. It's hidden in their settings. I have it enabled on all of my other accounts and I have no problems.
@_date: 2014-08-01 08:00:12
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:25:24
Their wallet IS on Cydia.
@_date: 2014-09-10 11:41:57
Yeah, she wants your B.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:46:13
Obviously not at the moment, but it could be in the long term. Only newbies look at the market and buy buy buy when things are going up up up. People who have studied the market for a long while before diving in can clearly see that a bull run is always followed by a correction. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:19:39
We have seen a couple of rather large transactions recently. People are speculating that is is because of the current state of Mt. Gox. Weird stuff happening over there.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:49:21
This was my theory too.Unfortunately, I was wrong. This is a Bitstamp address. Confirmed by a user here on Reddit that received a BTC withdrawal from this address.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:07:55
I am sorry. Did you actually read the law? Or are you one of those people who interprets things weird and is the reason we are in the system we are in now? By your logic, if I perforate a bill (FOLD IT), I am causing defacement.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:54:48
Not optimistic, based off historic values. Apparently you don't know the historic values of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:58:16
I am curious about this as well. I might buy one soon.
@_date: 2014-08-23 03:50:50
This made me lol
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:52:28
Well said!
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:53:42
People like you... I just don't understand.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:28
Multiple people on reddit have said it.
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:26:09
1JQAM6viFPfSAbR1WpRrYrFE7axsmeBHUH Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:18:29
I agree...
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:24:13
I have invites if you need one.
@_date: 2014-08-01 07:59:57
I think I read that the time penalty in between failed tries grows exponentially, quickly growing to a long wait.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:19:43
About 1.2
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:23:42
Simple is great. I have them. They are based in Portland, OR, but operate in conjunction with a Bancorp. Just a debit card, an app, and many ATM's to access. I also have a credit union, which is great, they haven't asked me a single question about what I am doing with bitcoin and I have been in there many times.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:20:19
Oh yeah. I have learned my lesson.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:19:24
You're the exact reason Dogecoin is even a thing. LOL
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:11:03
Ha email. I knew I had it I just never turned it on. Idiot.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:25:23
I was using an exchange. The scariest part and weakest link in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:51:16
First, I would like to say that I am sorry for your loss. I too lost about 1 BTC at GOX. With that said...
I am 99.9998% sure that Bitcoin will NEVER do a hard fork to recover users coins. This is an eternal technology, and the majority aren't going to risk Bitcoin's success on such a move.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:04:09
Does this tipbot work exactly like dogetipbot? I have yet to use tipping on Bitcoin. Your pretty much forced to use it for DOGE :P
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:24:43


Yeah I was looking this up a bit. Looks like the guy has a lot of different scams going on.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:05:15
His comments about the Internet in the early stages are basically the same as his comments about Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:48:41
Not writing an essay, but thanks grammar police/troll. I would have never known the difference :)
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:52:07
I agree with this approach.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:24:50
Me too haha
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:52:06
When? This is great. You literally just proved that YOUR the idiot on the internet that has no idea how to read, let alone communicate with people,  or give financial advice. Let me COPY &amp; PASTE for you....
"I am a 100% believer in Bitcoin.
That being said... In its current form of regulation, Bitcoin is the perfect financial vehicle to host a Ponzi scheme with.
That doesn't mean that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme itself."
"Basically, again relating Bitcoin to Gold.... A few companies within the Gold investment industry are definitely Ponzi schemes. That doesn't mean Gold in general is a Ponzi scheme."
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:25:56
Totally agree.
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:15:45
Absolutely. You are 1 in 21mil now ;) And eventually, more than 21 million people will be using Bitcoin. Value = SKY HIGH
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:51:00
Thank you my friend!
@_date: 2014-04-19 07:26:32
Yes, yes it is...
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:14:04
for the truly lazy :p
@_date: 2014-09-10 23:29:55
Yeah haha
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:13:54
I am utterly amused at how many people don't read the whole post.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:25:29
I did find it, on reddit. I never said where I found it.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:20:05
Yeah. Half of my savings though :(
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:25:04
1JQAM6viFPfSAbR1WpRrYrFE7axsmeBHUH Thank you. I will be watching closely.
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:52:49
No they were not, but they were close. Once again, I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:11:32
I am a 100% believer in Bitcoin.
That being said... In its current form of regulation, Bitcoin is the perfect financial vehicle to host a Ponzi scheme with.
That doesn't mean that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme itself.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:50:46
Ahh, this is freaking awesome. A lot of functionality is included!
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:07:55
Only thing they have done right.
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:53:55
BITCOIN IS NOT A PONZI SCHEME, but is currently one of the most unregulated financially perfect tools to host one with.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:50:32
I am a Bitcoin fanatic, and I truly believe in its potential... That said, I am going to have to agree that you have been drinking too much Kool-Aid and you need to take a break. Get off this sub and go read some actual Bitcoin news. There are problems with Bitcoin that need to be solved, and some of the ways to solve it COULD ruin it. The alternative crypto scenario is nothing to shove off either. Lets say the US government decided that they were going to create the USD in crypto form. (*shudders*) They very well could do it with their current financial resources and sheer outreach they have and the ability to regulate the hell out of Bitcoin.
What do you guys think? I still believe it is anti-fragile, but that doesn't mean we aren't going to hit some serious bumps along the way.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:36:07
Hey thank you... I appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:53:57
I think you are correct in that the transaction was broadcasted, but your wallet you were trying to receive funds in didn't reflect a balance yet because the transaction wasn't in a block yet.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:55:19
This user put it best:
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:48:55
So your basically asking for upvotes / tips. Didn't Andreas get banned for this? Does nobody know the rules? Haha
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:36:48
WOW! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:09:40
We could just email them and ask them, I would like that feature as well. Maybe something where we could tag what address belongs to who... What do you think?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:44:40
I agree On the paying more front, anyone with more than 1BTC should seriously be using a Trezor. Why would you skimp out to protect your money?
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:01:35
No advice, but I would do it. lol
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:37:52
I would suggest using a separate paper wallet service, it is in your best interest. Password encrypt your wallet, then put it away for a while.
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:34:18
Yes I do. How does my statement lead you to believe I don't?
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:29:25
Cloud mining is kind of sketchy. It is a "How do you prove what they are doing?" kind of thing.
Some, including me, think that cloud mining could very well be a ponzi scheme system where the older investors get paid by the newer investors.
My advice... Stay far away from anything you don't know inside and out. Just buy bitcoin and HOLD. Same regurgitated advice over and over again I know but it is really the best option in my opinion. 
It is unrealistic to get rich quick. Investments are meant to be held long term, and I believe that in 5-10 years bitcoin will be booming.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:43:36
This made me LOL
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:17:00
Umm, it goes down more or it goes back up.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:54:39
I may be wrong. Have you received your withdrawal yet?
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:28:12
Are you crazy? He doesn't want it. I will take it lol
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:36:31
Lol, I am not the company. I was just saying, if it is useless to you, I would take it. I will pay to have you ship it to me.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:46:27
Didn't know about it until now. :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:34:35
I didn't mean literally tip me haha. I meant tips for using changetip. XD
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:23:14
Wow, your cool. I guess I could have been a dickhead like you but I was seriously asking... I've seen people talk mad shit to people who do this kind of thing. He asked for people to upvote his post in order to get visibility on the front page to remind people of the AMA. How is that okay?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:23:51
Yeah, I do.
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:16:52
Judging by the most recent posts, it isn't.
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:30:37
Lol meep meep! Thank You!!!
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:54:41
Satirical I know, made me chuckle...
That said...
Just because Bitcoin is in a downward spiral doesn't make the statement any less true... Bitcoin may not be perfect, hell it might not succeed at all, but FIAT truly doesn't have self value other than world governments leading people to believe it does. It is paper. That's it. And it can be made (printed) by anyone with the balls and the skills.
There are countries, most notably China, who are using up their massive foreign FIAT reserves to buy gold in order to divest as much as possible from the US economy.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:45:49
Can I have yours if you don't like it any more?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:00:00
It is a funny, and true question lol
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:32:44
Hmm, it won't let me set my email. It just does nothing when I click save.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:37:29
Also, that subreddit is pretty sad haha. I just checked it out.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:09:42
I am sure it is cached somewhere too
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:04:09
I am all for Trezor. In fact, I am about to buy one now that they are on amazon. But I believe the OP means something truly life changing revolutionary. SatoshiLabs has a great platform to build off of now though!
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:47:18
Why not! Here you go. 50 bits
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:37:07
Damn dude. I have been looking for like 30 minutes and I can't find anything, and I am a search engine king. Could it be it wasn't on reddit?
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:33:10
Good news, they don't! Sort of.
Our entire economy is in the hands of 12 board members at the federal reserve, a privately held entity that can never be publicly audited.... Not to find out who the owners are OR how much "money" (gold) they hold... Some system...
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:50:57
Yep yep. Good thing a fix is in the works by Gavin. Hopefully his "fix" doesn't break Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:22:39
You are a PHP programmer (somewhat intelligent individual) and you are asking this question?
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:34:34
Your welcome :) I hope they release him today, sounds like his brother is lonely. Sorry I don't have much on changetip or I would have donated some real money...
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:39:46
Yeah thats great. People bitching about not being able to commit, they haven't anyways...
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:29:35
Ahh I see. Sounds cool! When I buy some more BTC I will send a bit to my tip wallet and come check it out.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:33:12
Damn :( Thought I was on to something haha
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:22:41
This just gets better and better. Good thing I had NOTHING in stamp.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:20:34
Could be that the 2nd to last block was mined nearly 2 hours ago... 
 
a block just got mined about 8 minutes ago. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:22:57
I didn't. Next time you post something like this though you might want to say why.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:53:38
When telling you to buy Bitcoin and HOLD, I assumed you had good knowledge of Bitcoin and how it worked before deciding that you wanted some. What the exchange rate has been, how to secure your wealth, etc.
Do you truly know about Bitcoin the protocol? Have you read the white paper? If not, your correct about my statement, and how it applies to you is contradictory.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:41:57
Hmm they must be magic if they got mere plastic to operate like a computing device. Quit trolling. I am seeing you everywhere.
If you don't want it, one of us who does would gladly take it off your hands... I would even pay to ship it to me...
No deal? Shut up about your "piece of plastic" then.
@_date: 2015-01-31 04:54:39
Well it was a very brilliant idea.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:06:16
Oh that's great!!! Well I hope you have a good day. Enjoy time with him today.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:09:14
Where did you get that figure from? Proof?
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:47:53
I saw it is multi-platform, so that is pretty legit.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:27:18
I will. Homelessness and hunger have always pissed me off. We have every technology and knowledge to solve both those problems for the world. Thanks for the kindness!
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:18:52
Great deed you are doing. Many thanks. I'd like to give mine to a homeless shelter. Is there one on the list? I looked through but I didn't see one. Anyways, I too shall heavily promote this post because that is quite a list of bitcoin accepting charities!
Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:16:41
I am very sorry to hear about your troubles. You seem like a very nice guy, and unfortunately, it seems bad shit happens to good people. I know all too well how hard it is to lose a loved one, especially a creature that loves you UNCONDITIONALLY unlike humans. I just lost my Doberman to various cancers and my girlfriend just lost her dog too. He was my little buddy. I hope Oscar fully recovers and lives for quite a while longer. Hang in there. Things will get better. 500 bits
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:46:11
Yeah my aunt is a "business owner" along with a lot of other people. That literally doesn't mean anything... Some peoples businesses own them. What kind of business do you own? Do you enjoy it every day?
I'll admit, I shouldn't have said stolen because it is open source. What I should have said was raped for IP...
As for you being upset, I get it. But the way you went about it was completely childish. Basically claiming it has no utility anymore. Drama. It still has value to someone besides you, why don't you sell it to recoup some of your investment in them if you truly feel that way?
 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:46:23
You know, I have never thought of cars this way... Eye opening. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:54:29
Not for you, but fyi... your not the only person in the world, and not everybody thinks like you.
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:28:10
I don't ever feel bad for using a word. I am using it to imply something, not to be 100% right and serious each and every time I write something.
I agree with everything you said about the licensing though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:13:29
If you do have a reason to complain, come up with an intelligent complaint, not ZOMG my little plastic keychain doesn't work anymore. 
Free speech is more than welcome in my book. Mind switching it up from the same sentence you have used again and again though?
You ARE trolling, I don't "worship" them. I just happen to be a business major and I would have done the exact same thing in the face of having my baby stolen if I were them. You have obviously never created a purely digital work of art / IP before. Your just butthurt for no good reason.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:39:39
Might be a stretch but....
This statement makes me think Coinbase bought Coinsetter, hence the candid legal team reply and Coinbase being able to say they are first. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:01:33
Totally possible in many ways.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:04:21
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:15:46
WOW... *facepalm* In no situation will Bitcoin go less than 0.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:39:08
I had a feeling that most people who were complaining don't even own one.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:16:50
And honestly I am not trying to start something, but it is definitely not imaginary. The fact that Bitcoin is only computer data, I understand where your coming from, but the network is a very real thing. The exact opposite of imaginary in fact. HAHA XD
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:20:59
Dude. Imagine if we did this on a large scale.
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:54:57
In other cases my friend... Like hard drive failure.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:36:26
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:24:20
This is brilliant. Thanks for the huge smile and a few good laughs.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:23:09
I am so down to go looking for this drive. Who is with me?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:00:56
Could it have been a Brainwallet? brainwallet.io
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:10:20
Some people like to make throwaway accounts so that whoever/whatever they are talking about is not linked to them.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:27:35
No but I have a friend that does. I wouldn't need personal info, but NVM I don't want to help you now anyway. Your a douche.
@_date: 2015-07-03 19:16:17
I am not sure if your trolling or not. I offered to help you get your coins back and the response I got was "No because then I can't bitch about it." Okay... Have a nice time being negative. :)
@_date: 2015-07-11 00:27:51
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:40:18
I have a bit on there as well. I believe he did say that as soon as he received any info he would update Bitcoin Builder and pay out ASAP.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:44:09
Hello everyone. OP... You are very kind for doing this.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:50:46
Also, what about a backup of your phone? Don't you have one on your computer/iCloud?
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:05:08
Hmm, that sucks dude. I have lost a GOOD amount of BTC before. I am rebuilding now at these prices, but it just sucks. One day when BTC is huge we are going to look back on our lost millions lol
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:47:27
Your welcome :) I will add, for the short term... we may bounce around and even head a little lower after this huge market pump we are experiencing.

Well, internet. Not exactly the best place to pick up emotion.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:31:51
I agree, but this is reddit. Not everyone is using proper english.
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:21:25
I don't even think they support doge. I know they showed that they were going to but I can't find it at all on their site.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:49:52
Do you not have iCloud? The notes should be saved there if you do. I could help you if you want, but I would try to figure it out myself. 
I won't steal your coins either, unlike other sleezeballs.

Thanks Bruce. Garza is a joke. I think of him like the Madoff of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:38:33
Bring on the PR
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:32:17
I don't trust my coins to my phone. Too many fears and all kinds of things that can go wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:45:49
If it is the same wallet, any backup should work.
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:12:19
Sweet. Bitcoin just keeps chugging.
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:27:08
You know what I was thinking for a brief moment during all of that. What if it was true to some degree? Maybe he worked with Ross.
@_date: 2015-02-14 08:07:24
Love it... So true.
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:41:09
I passed over this as a simple mistake until I read your comment, re-read Auzzar2's comment, and then laughed. He writes it out like a math problem and its still wrong!
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:27:33
Congratulations &amp; welcome to the club :) 
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:40:42
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:41:56
It is sad that you believe this. Facebook could easily get MySpaced.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:31:48
Lol good one
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:55:52
This is really cool! Did you make this bot? My xbox live just ran out in January. Can you make it send yourself codes? I am going to tell my buddies about this for sure! Maybe I will get some XBL. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:08:46
No, whats weird about Karpeles is we still know nothing about the guy except that he has been a fraud before and he is really good at getting out of things. Oh and he likes his Starbucks. Haha.
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:21:39
In the long term, it doesn't make any sense why it wouldn't go up. More people are getting on board, more merchants, more ATM's, more investments into companies working with BTC... Plus the valuation of bitcoin companies is crazy high in comparison to what BTC is worth.
@_date: 2015-02-14 04:26:40
Oh yes, the cat that is so important that the company is named after it.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:31:21
I still find myself doing this out of pure habit...
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:36:55
From what I understand, it doesn't mean "nothing" but rather is directly tied to the number of transactions that occur on the Bitcoin network. This is due to the common knowledge that reusing an address greatly reduces your potential privacy.
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:31:28
I thought the exact same. Maybe it isn't good to have the blue and pink lines the way they are with the actual BTC holding represented by a pink dot.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:54:36
What an idiot... "In case you didn't know, all financial institutions and governments are anti-bitcoin."
Just another case of someone thinking they know everything because they are a "pro/expert" in their field.

With the responses in this thread, your not getting much help. Have you unplugged your trezor, restarted your computer, booted up, went to mytrezor.com, replugged your trezor in and they still weren't there? If you have passphrase on, and you are typing it wrong, it will take you to an entirely different wallet. Make sure you check all this and if you need more help, message me.
Disclaimer: I am not with Trezor or Satoshi Labs, just own a trezor and have experienced some of the same issues. I will help if wanted, but I wouldn't trust me if I were you. Not going to steal your coins, just saying. You should talk to support first.

Posthumous Mt. Gox
Edit: I am sure there are people out there who wish him death though.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:38:17
Same question... wtf?!
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:12:04
I would just hodl them. If you feel like diversifying, spend small amounts buying some other coins.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:38:37
Lol, I was 10 minutes late buying a ticket. I NEVER buy them, but these were my exact thoughts. If I won last night, I would have invested 95% of it into bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:32:05
It is pretty cool. What do you need to know?
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:31:02
Cool. I hope you get your data back. It truly is a shitty thing to lose. You should definitely be able to if the flash chip wasn't damaged at all. In the case that he can't fix it, Apple might be able to help. If there is an Apple store around you, you might be able to get your phone fixed same day.
Edit: Your very welcome too btw haha
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:32:40
Oh me too. The 5% would be some gold, silver, property, and startup to fund my business.
