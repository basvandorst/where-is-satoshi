No, I don't understand. I'm new, submitted a question, briefly expressed gratitude, and I feel like overall I've been considerably polite relative to others.
Can you explain, what exactly about my situation and subsequent responses causes you to respond de-constructively? It's an actual question because everyone else answered without hostility, regardless of their advice on my predicament.
Even after all of this oh-so-genuine dialogue of yours, you've put your internalized anger so high above the consideration to help that you can't even think about the prospect of helping me recover these Bitcoins.

Thank you for welcoming me to the Bitcoin community. Allow me to drop my college exams and focus on researching bitcoins.
Bitcoin will not be a success if you approach a situation where a novice user has a question with that kind of response.
Nothing with a stubborn, esoteric userbase succeeds.

Like all other technology enterprises, new ideas (the tablet computing era, for example) flourish with ease-of-use, intuitiveness, and productivity.
So yeah I do think this also applies to the success of Bitcoin. Idk what to say about you

Okay, well I have my reasons for trying Bitcoin, like certain vendor discounts and the philosophy behind it. I don't understand, when someone posts a question, is it standard procedure to ask how they're going to spend their money?
Do you think it's a good way to increase the validity of Bitcoin by suggesting you know the better way for new users to be spending their time?
This community is cancered by impatience and arrogance.
