I doubt you'll find a website willing to take a CC that isn't a cash advance without proving your identity.
There would be nothing stopping you from filing a chargeback if they accepted that.

If the merchant wants fiat in a reasonable amount of time they're still paying fees somewhere.

No, if someone hacks into a merchant website and steals their database of payment information you have no clue that happened, in most cases the merchant doesn't know for a while either.
You can only be held responsible if you know your CC was stolen and didn't report it.

If someone stole your wallet and you didn't report your CC stolen immediately you can be held responsible for any charges until you report the theft.
Most CC fraud is a result of them being stolen from insecure websites/merchants, meaning they generally get the CC# and the billing/shipping address used. 
Asking for a DL greatly increases their chances of winning a chargeback dispute. Without it they have basically zero chance of keeping the money if a chargeback is reported. With it the chance is probably closer to 100% unless you can prove your DL was stolen.(Police report or the like)

If you file a chargeback they need to prove that you did indeed make the purchase.
Verifying your DL is generally enough for the CC company to side with them instead of you. 
Anyone could use your CC to buy bitcoins, but it's unlikely a CC scammer will have your driver's license.

Right so I have a starbucks gift card. 
How do I sell it to fold? I see no option to do anything except load bitcoins by paying with my bitcoin wallet.

How exactly did you buy bitcoin with this?
It seems to just be a way to pay for coffee in bitcoin.
