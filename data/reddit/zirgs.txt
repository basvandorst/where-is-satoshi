People discuss and upvote threads related to drugs and illegal activity because Bitcoin would be nearly worthless without them.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:54:41
The market cap means nothing if someone just fills all the blocks with spam transactions by sending coins to himself and prevents everyone else from executing transactions.
It's quite easy to do it given the current fees and block sizes. Any bank could buy a lot of coins in advance and then terrorise the BTC network for months.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:02:48
How many of those listings are scam or submitted by the cops?
Also Evolution was run by smart people - they did the right thing by disappearing and stealing all the coins - only a fool would stick around and risk getting life in prison like that dumbass Ulbricht.
Agora will probably disappear soon as well.
@_date: 2015-06-02 07:42:22
After Ulbricht's trial - anyone who tries to do the same thing as he did and for some reason still resides in the USA is goddamn fucking retarded.

Why would I exchange one of the most powerful currencies to internet funbux?
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:42:26
I don't understand that either. You don't need a credit card to purchase illegal drugs in the first place.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:36:47
Those "entrenched political interests" could completely paralyse the whole bitcoin network by spending 5000$ a day.
They don't because they don't give a shit.

The murder charges haven't been dropped. That prick will never see the light of day again - good riddance.
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:08:32
But how many of those transactions are actual transactions?
Instead of moving money to tumblers, exchanges or between addresses that belong to the same user?
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:55:32
Bitcoin's monetary policy is the very definition of extreme austerity.

Of  course there's also drugs and child porn.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:04:11
But it's more logical to NOT spend them and wait for others to spend instead.

That's just one of the murders. He'll still get charged for the rest of them.

I don't think that it's wise for the network to rely on volunteers. Nodes just like miners should be compensated somehow.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:17:55
Why? That chart clearly shows that sooner or later all the biggest markets either get shut down by the cops or the owners steal all the coins and run.
And in both cases their users lose all of their money.
What makes you think that Agora will be any different?


You just strengthened my argument that the only reason why Bitcoin has value is because you can buy illegal shit with it.

Bitcoin is only useful to buy illegal shit - that's why this post belongs here.
And that's why people are defending Ulbricht and darknet markets.
Because they know that without illegal shit their beloved currency would be nearly worthless.

It's not useful for anything else.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:14:19
Yeah, but unlike miners who also are full nodes you don't get any rewards for that.
@_date: 2015-06-21 18:28:59
By that logic if you bury your fiat money somewhere only you know then the govt can not seize it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:53:36
But how does that benefit ME?
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:29:54
And how much money do they actually earn compared to darknet markets?
I can buy everything I need with my credit card. There's no reason to buy bitcoin to purchase legal stuff.
And if DNMs are unimportant then why does this sub treat Ross Ulbricht like god and upvote a lot of threads that are related to darknet markets and illegal drugs?

You are forgetting one single thing.

You're the one who says that current governments must be abolished.
Who would force him to pay and on what basis if there would be no government and laws?
Who would even investigate the murder?
To put anyone in the database you must first determine who they are.
And investigators usually need to apprehend some suspects, interrogate them, search their homes and so on - you know - the usual police work.
Who would do that in your ancap world?
Currently no private company can search my house, for example - only government's police with appropriate warrants can do that.

That's irrelevant.
People murder other people all the time.
What usually happens after is:
1. government's police catches the perpetrator if possible.

Evidence? Are you fucking joking?
No court will accept it as evidence because it's hacked together by some random programmers and BTC is not real money.
Blockchain is not protected by any laws and regulations and BTC protocol itself is not an official standard.

And even if you (or the law enforcement) somehow determine who owns the last address.

You can't prove that he's the thief.

Most of the posters I've seen here are strictly opposed to any kind of government regulation or control.
Lack of regulation is a double edged sword, because if the protocol allows you to send money without any restrictions, then it also allows the same for the criminals who have stolen your money.
And because of how the protocol works - it's hard for the law enforcement to track and retrieve your money.
Traditional banking system is a lot more convenient to them.

People who have over 100k euros just sitting around are not poor - I have zero sympathy for them.
Want to dodge taxes and hide (and launder) your money in a tax haven - then be prepared to lose some of it.
Anything over the insured amount (100k) is a speculative and risky investment - don't want to risk - then don't keep more than 100k in a bank. 
And that's not a problem for ordinary people, because very few have more than 100k in their accounts anyway.

The main reason why I haven't tried any drugs is because they're illegal and one short-term high is not worth the trouble.
Unlike filesharing - you have to interact with actual criminals to obtain drugs (and there's a risk that you'll be arrested during a drug deal).
And because they're illegal - there's zero quality control - the drugs might be contaminated with god knows what or they might be too pure and easy to overdose.
Markets like SR do not help either - because the stuff might still be contaminated and it's not wise to give anyone your real address while committing a crime.

 &gt; I hope reputable hardware companies start producing miners
They probably already do - and just keep their miners to themselves. Probably that's why the hashrate keeps climbing.
Miner's only purpose is to make money - it can't do anything else.
So there is no reason to sell it unless you sell at a ridiculously high profit margin.
Or just scam your customers like BFL and deliver miners after they're not profitable any more.
That's the problem with the whole mining industry - if you have to buy a miner - you're already a loser - plain and simple.

Internet and electricity infrastructure sometimes needs to be subsidised in less populated or remote places.
It's usually done by the government, because private companies do not want to operate at a loss.
For example the main electricity distribution company in Latvia is state owned and thanks to that electricity in Latvia is available everywhere. (Profit from more populated and wealthier places is used to subsidise remote and less populated regions) 
If that company were private then electricity would probably be available only in the biggest cities.

@_date: 2014-03-09 23:39:30
Yeah, but BTC is a global currency without any capital controls or anything.
After a theft the money can change hands multiple times and go through multiple countries - and you can't even determine which ones.
Good luck matching an address to some random foreign hacker.

You really have to catch the thief with his pants down to do this.
He can easily destroy them as soon as he sees the police knocking on his door.
So even if you know exactly which address holds your coins that can't help at all if the keys have been destroyed.

 &gt; nobody can confiscate/freeze your funds like they can with a bank/paypal

@_date: 2014-11-09 08:56:32


Because it also makes difficult for foreign intelligence agencies to discover your own spies.
Chinese and Russian intelligence agencies are not staffed with idiots.
If there's a backdoor that allows to discover identities of activists within the USA, then that same backdoor can be used to discover identities of American spies in China.
And they definitely don't want that.
Of course they run their own exit nodes - but spies most likely do not use them and connect to CIA or NSA Tor hidden services instead.
If it's possible for NSA to determine whether you connect to Silk Road,  then it's equally possible for FSB to determine whether suspected American spies are connecting to CIA or NSA hidden services.

Bitcoin parts of the exchanges are totally unregulated and they can steal your coins without any legal repercussions. 
They can also freely manipulate buy and sell orders to take your money - that also is not regulated.
As they say about casinos - the house always wins.

This is all bullshit.
If you really want to prevent 51% attacks - gpu and cpu mining needs to be profitable again.
Yes there are risks of botnet mining.
But botnets are easy to detect (they reduce your computer's performance).
And it's very unlikely that a single botnet would take over 51%.
 
Also the algorithm itself must change so that a minimum that's required for mining is a DX11 compatible graphics card.
Good luck designing an ASIC for that - you'll be competing with AMD's and nVidia's high-end GPUs.

Remember that BTC allows hackers to steal your money from pretty much anywhere.
And of course cops can follow the money, but they can't know where it changes hands from criminals to non-criminals - addresses are anonymous.

Bitcoin is defective by design and will never be a successful currency.

They will not lose anything - just burn some BTC, create a new account and continue as before.
Revealing your true identity on places like Silk Road is an insanely stupid thing to do - that's why site admins can't really do anything.
And on places like OpenBazaar without any centralised authority there are no admins at all - so there would be pure anarchy over there.
If you have to burn less BTC than you earn selling fake shit then everyone will do it.
And maintaining permanent identities (instead of creating a new one for each deal) increases the risk of identification by authorities.

The problem is that the police will not be happy to waste their time and search the blockchain.
Because it's impossible to determine when the money was laundered for example.
Let's say it goes through 15 addresses before someone spends it on burgers or whatever.
You can't prove that the person who bought that burger is the thief and not someone who bought stolen and laundered coins at an exchange or localbitcoins or whatever.
Traditional banking system is much more transparent.
Police can immediately determine where the money is.
Banks will give them all the account details they need.
It's easy to seize the stolen money as well.
That's why the police most likely will refuse to invesgate BTC crimes and will tell you to use real money next time.

Now you know the reason for those delays.
Miner manufacturers mined with your miners themselves for 6 months.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:43:49


The problem is that after a few uses people become physically dependent on drugs.
They can no longer choose whether to use them. They have to, because otherwise they feel like shit. They're no longer adults with free will, but drug addicted zombies that require drugs to feel somewhat normal.
That's why the practice to hook people on drugs and them bleed them dry should be illegal.
If you manage to synthesise a drug that has all the positive effects of heroin and cocaine and that isn't addictive I would be the first to  demand its legalisation.
You can assemble a car in your garage right now, but that doesn't mean that you have thee right to drive it on public roads. First it must be certified and registered and must conform to all local road-worthiness standards.
The same applies to weapons in most EU countries - it doesn't matter how and who manufactured them. 
You have to have a permit to own and use them and they must be registered.
Possession of an unregistered weapon is a serious criminal offence in many countries - that's why small-time criminals don't generally carry them, because they can get more time for illegal possession of a weapon than for whatever petty crimes they usually commit.
And actually one of the reasons (not the main one) why I haven't used drugs is because they're illegal.
I don't want any trouble with the law enforcement and there's absolutely no quality control.
And that's why I think that risks of their use far outweigh the benefits.
I don't even know where to buy drugs in my area - I'm that far removed from the criminal environment that surrounds drug trade.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:58:22
No I didn't, because I'm not an American and haven't even been in the USA.
But I totally voted for people who pass laws in my country. And here the vast majority of people want drugs to stay illegal.
Some people might not like it, but that's democracy. And the only way to change it is to convince the rest of the people that drugs must be legalised/decriminalised.
If you can't do that then it's better to move to a different society somewhere else.
And yes - I voted for the wars indirectly, because I voted for a party that promised NATO membership and closer ties with the USA. And they totally fulfilled those promises. That's why soldiers of my country served in Iraq and Afghanistan too.

Drug dealers create victims.
They knowingly sell substances that turn their users into addicted zombies that harm themselves and people around them.
And a lot of times they lie about the effects of drugs they sell.
And users' addiction is beneficial to them, because the users are guaranteed to come back and ask for more - they have to, because they're addicted and can't live normally without drugs.
Dealers also cut their drugs with random shit that makes them even more dangerous than they already are.
So stop this "victimless crime" bullshit.

What do you mean by "ending prohibition"?
Decriminalisation for personal use? ( I support that btw )
Or allowing heroin to be sold at the local supermarket right next to alcohol?
Also illegality is what keeps many people from trying hard drugs, because the high they provide isn't worth the risk of legal troubles, addiction and overdose.
I don't even know where to buy drugs in my neighbourhood.
I'm that far removed from the criminal environment that surrounds them.

The Greek government can't print Euros at will.

External debt means nothing.
If you have a lot of multi-national companies in your country then their debt will be added to your external debt.
One example is Ireland - a lot of American companies have their European headquarters there because of favourable tax legislation.
It doesn't mean that you or your country will have to pay it back.

You, bitcoiners seem to like the word "trustless".
And "trustless" means that you should trust no one.
Especially people whose identity you don't know and reviews that can easily be faked.

Abandoning the Euro and asking help from Russia and China would be like refusing to pay back your local bank and going to borrow from the local mafia loan shark instead.

He was never tried for that, because they had a lot of other shit against him and he's already serving 2 life sentences. No point to waste more tax money, because thankfully no one was actually killed.

He got a cut from every sale - that's the same thing.

Yes they will, but I do not plan to sit on a pile of money and do nothing with it.
All the "fiat" currencies are inflating to discourage hoarding and that's a good thing.

The difference is that it's possible to identify the guy on a street corner.
Good luck identifying a DNM vendor.

Some of those places are not that bad - especially if you have a lot of money.
Moldova or Serbia for example.
Even Russia or Belarus are better than life in an U.S. prison.

Investment is not the same thing as currency.

It's impossible to ban people from DNMs - so a dealer who just want to see the world burn can cause a lot of damage by selling people poisons or whatever.
There's no inspections, quality control or anything and no one to complain to.
It's extremely stupid to put stuff that's purchased there in your body.
And the seller who sold you the poison can then create a new profile - it's impossible to ban him, because there's no way to identify a particular tor user.

He's an idiot.
The EUR is a better currency than bitcoin will ever be.

I'm dead serious.
All of my savings are in Euros. And I receive my salary in them as well.
If I was stupid enough to convert them to BTC I would have lost more than half of my savings during 2014.
