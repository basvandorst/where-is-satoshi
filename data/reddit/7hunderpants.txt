The fair comparison is the bigger screen iPhone which is $1450....
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:04:54
Nope.....the top phone of Samsung is the Note 9....that's the comment that I'm replying to.
Also apple don't lower the price of their phone's untill they are superseeded by the next model.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:06:29
You could not be more wrong ....the note 9 was released at the end of August.

This is sexist and stupid. Gender does  not matter.
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:58:19
I don't give a shit about gender race or religion as long as they do what they are supposed to and well. 
Posts like this suggest women are less capable than men which is not true, women are just as capable.

@_date: 2016-12-12 03:19:18
But if I loose the phone I can always transfer to another phone , am I correct?

I have adjusted all the text as you said , now the mii band vibrates intermittently and will only show the bitcoin price when i press the play icon in the tasker app!! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:15:45

@_date: 2017-10-10 21:55:14

@_date: 2017-09-05 01:23:52
I think I did not input the text properly.i read over the instruction  twice.
It causes my mii band to vibrate intermittently, no bitcoin price!
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:39:51

@_date: 2017-09-02 21:16:46


Sounds ominous!! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:39:10
Removed , the band still keeps vibrating every few seconds. ( Just seen that the timer was on in the function app, turned it off and still no BTC price when I double tap)
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:52:34
