Hey Bruce - I attempted to add you on linkedin and twitter but have not heard back yet. A group that I am working on has access to a large amount of BTC's which they are interested in parlaying into a bitcoin ETF of some sort. Please message me if your interested in discussing the opportunity further.

Mr. Bruce Fenton:
I contacted you on linkedin as I would like to discuss some of the projects that I am working on outside of a public discussion board environment. I am working from Vancouver, BC at putting together a publicly listed Canadian bitcoin ETF.

Are you monitoring the results of the Vancouver ATM? They did $1 GROSS Revenue in business the first month.

One of the key problems with btc is the elitist techie culture surrounding i&gt;&gt; Stop being an elitist bitcoin prick.


t. If everyone who has btc stolen from them is told they are morons - its bad for the currency. I never did anything wrong - someone wrote a bot or hacked a computer or did something else that physically stole btc - they are at fault not me. All those people hacking and stealing btc are taking away from btc as a currency as well. The btc community needs to solve this security issue which will probably happen over the next few years.

HAAH - I wouldn't consider someone rich unless they had:
X,XXX.XX BTC - about a 1,000 BTC would be considered RICH.

Make no mistake - Bitcoin was not a "bubble" at $1,000. NEW NEWS CAME TO MARKET THAT CAUSED IT TO BECOME LESS VALUABLE - THATS DIFFERENT THEN A MARKET BUBBLE.

It's not good news that China is moving against bitcoin. Remember that chinese buyers have propped the price of bitcoin and took the price from a couple hundred bucks to $1,250.

Bitcoin goes from $1,000 to $100,000 per coin once it:
a). Gains broader acceptance in the market
b). Institutional money and old money begin purchasing it as a legitimate investment asset class.
Bitcoin goes fromm $100,000 to $1M per coin when:
a). some economic trigger regarding fiat currencies whereby populations in general no longer trust their government issued fiat currency.

best thing to do is install the blockchain wallet app on your phone. It allows you to scan in your public wallet key such that it monitors the balance. 
Note that this is the equivalent of a read only file - you cannot spend the coins, only "see" the balance of what's in that public wallet key. You need the private wallet key in order to spend it.

I think there may be a delay in Mt. GOX paying out the bitcoin as there's other types of delays!
