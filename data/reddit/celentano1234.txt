can you draw us kindly  a graph from where btc started and where it is now?  
very much appreciated:)

this-&gt; 
+my 2 cents:
1) take a look at these bitcoin futures contracts official webpages of CBOE and CME where you find the exact amounts and settlement DAYS
CBOE:  CME: 
2) remember those days mark them in the calendar and write BIG: DONT PANIC just hold and ignore! 
3) basically, the settlement cycle is every 2weeks: CBOE contracts settle apparently every 2nd wednesday of each month // CME contracts settle 2 weeks after the CBOE ones (detailed dates in above links)
4) now, everyone who is skeptical, i am not going to argue ,, just stating once this: how big of a coincidence is it that the btc/crypto prices fell ABRUPTLY by more than 30% just ONE day before the CBOE contract settlement day? :-)
5) now a 2nd thing to make clear: the futures are traded/settled solely in USD$ nothing to do with actual BTC! people have to understand when we talk about futures, we dont claim the futures by themselves influence the btc price-&gt; but rather say that the futures investors who hold such contracts go into the actual bitcoin markets to buy/sell intensely to achieve their goals (be it dumping or pumping)-&gt;"goals" meaning, to end up on the "winning" side at the futures settlement date!!
6) Now EVERYONE must understand: this game is not possible if everyone just CALMS DOWNS and does not panic and just ignores entirely that there are even any kind of "settlement" dates in existence!! REMEMBER: Those are BITCOIN futures! so even more reason to ignore them entirely if you are into ALTCOINS!! Altcoins are totally irrelevant to Futures investors, keep that in mind!
because if you behave just normal (lets say you plan to hold your favorite coin longterm), then just hold it longterm as you have planned to do, entirely ignoring what happens in the markets at those monthly settlement days! their game cannot be pulled off, if people dont panic and inform themselves
7) crypto is here to stay people! switzerland, germany, usa, singapore, japan, all major countries embraced already crypto and collect taxes on them! that means crypto is already legalized basically (otherwise you cannot collect taxes right;)! and do not get it wrong: REGULATION is GOOD because it takes fears away and opens up to real businesses initially reluctant to join!
do not get fooled and panic sell for every negative news guys! crypto is like the internet, it will be always in our lifes, this at least has to be the common believe otherwise it would not exist! value can only go up if people believe in it and support the technology longterm! its just a small baby now, mass adoption is not even starting! imagine what happens when mass adoption arrives and all those great projects deliver on their roadmaps with working products! :) people are now just very uninformed and greedy with betting shortterm on some nonsense.coins without any githubs, innovation, or real life solutions! people will do more research and be informed, so that panicking will not be caused easily anymore!
Buffett says: buy low! wherever lows, there are chances
PS: yes, the CBOE/CME bitcoin futures shorting guys could try to short always every month, BUT if people to not let influence them by that and do abovementioned things like research, dont panic, etc. the futures should not be able to "play" with the market like they did yesterday! also dont forget: negative news hitting from kroea and china supported maybe the "short" players. but Alibaba is going into mining, blockstream got lightning ready, japanese biggest bank anounces crypto exchange.... many positives , too :) stay calm and inform yourselves:D

just IGNORE entirely the existence of those futures dates!! because you are falling into psychological trap here:
why do you care about those futures? let them play, they are not powerful enough to drive the market ! it is JANUARY! they got lucky due to parallel FUD from korea and china etc.! in january it ALWAYS dips! just now a bit more!
for the future, just IGNORE the futures dates, because if sth happens in those dates, it would mean it is happening JUST because of the futures, and NOT because of any FUNDAMENTAL relevant changes/news about any crypto! :) the guys are just playing , they are not interested in a bad market, because in a bad market, they would not be able to play , they are also interested in flourishing market!

-hi parker, i have exact same theory. because its just too cosmic of a coincidence that the price fall came just 1day before the settlement date.  crypto is here to stay , many countries have embraced it and made it clear already! people just panicking. people should do more research and believe in crypto (but disregard "penny/copy-coins")! may i ask for your candid opinion:  
since there are literally every 2 weeks (first cboe followed by cme) contract settlements scheduled,  what is your feeling for the future?  can they pull such a thing off in 1 month-cycles?  or was it now so easy because its january plus bad news from china+korea?if you think they pull it off monthly,  then that would mean btc price going to break like converging to 10$. because they play the "short" game, the price must go down month by month, right (assuming they are able to pull it off)?
are the "Long" players really so power-less and irrelevant , the shorters always will win?
and what happened to the altcoins, why they tanking almost systematically so hard? alts have nothing to do with the futures contracts...
hope for your 2 cents on this

hey dude, very interesting. just tell me: is it meaningful to compare NEO with Zcash?  Well you are right, no it is not meaningful, because totally different usecases.
And now i am asking you: You are in crypto? Apparently you dont like btc. And compare it to others. But let me ask you:  You are yelling its not a store of value,  then WHAT IS THE STORE OF VALUE in the crypto world my dear friend?
Or do you belong to the delusional guys who claim there is no need in the world for a secure decentralized store of value? if you think that, you are in the wrong place and stay in traditional finance.
Oh wait, also in the real world there is GOLD the ONE store of value held by hundreds of central banks.  
So for ALL the highly intelligent people here in crypto who talk shit to my post:  please enlighten us which coin you think should take the place of value storage?
Because that a world economy needs the usecase "store of value" is a FACT (not because I say so, because the whole world aka governments&amp;banks say so=gold), otherwise you are some kind of categoric deniers living in utopia and do not understand that there MUST exist the counterpart of gold in the cryptoworld.  
get it already and educate yourself. you can argue whether BTC is the one, but you are denying reality when you think that the "store of value" usecase is irrelevant;)
AND PS: i never wrote store of value is the only usecase. i wrote there is only ONE crypto for it. but BTC can have surely additional features! Whereas no other coin can be as much as suitable for value store as btc or vrm!

hi, sure you are right. I did not have the background for a precise question. your information is great, thanks! 
and if we bring electricity costs into the game-&gt;what is the mathematical formula considering electricity?  (take any electricity cost that you know of in any region).  How would this affect the profitability of above 1block per week calculation?   What is the electricity demand of one such Antminer device approx?
And just to have a picture: if you guys say a lot of people "Pool-mine" -&gt; but the big firms like bitmain etc. they have their own "mining farms" and their own devices, so they are I assume highly profitable businesses while solo-mining in a large scale, correct?
So they must have figured out some kind of threshold where they are profitable with  solo-mining ? the threshold would be the number of devices combined with electrivity costs? one block has 12.5btc reward. But the huge mining farms make like revenues of about 500mill$ per year i guess. so that would translate that they are mining like 300 blocks per month?? they have 360,000 antminers to achieve 300blocks per month??

I may change my question, if this helps you to reply a bit better:
PUt all the costs aside - i want to know: How many devices (which type asic/gpu, etc.?) does a miner need to be able (given current BTC chain-difficulty rates) to produce blocks in a realistic and regular fashion?
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:08:57
hi thanks! thats sounds a lot !  What is the cost on amazon for such s9 devide which you have in mind which is suitable for this block mining?
do the big farms like bitmain,viabtc,genesis mining  use these s9 devices , too , or what? are they solo- or pool-mining?   how are they so profitable , i mean if a billionaire comes and purchases the same amount of devices like viabtc,  would he have similiar output?  Or is there any other component (technical know-how) that affects mining efficiency?
are you saying if you have 50,000 of those devices, then you would very likely mine 1 block per day? one block has 12.5btc reward. But the huge mining farms make like revenues of about 500mill$ per year i guess. so that would translate that they are mining like 300 blocks per month??  they have 360,000 devices to achieve 300blocks per month??

a post from differen thread, copied here:::
u realize btc is the USD for crypto , it is leading currency to get guys like you "into" crypto, and if btc goes down all crypto goes down?  why would any crypto supporter be in favor of this scenario?  which currency should in your view fulfill the goal of value store better and be the key leading currency (like the USD for the fiat world)?
as i understand you dont like btc features. but what is shizophrenic : nothing HINDERS you to use hundreds of great altcoins, right?  Dont you get it that one apple (btc) has nothing to do with one oranges (altcoins)? You can have apples, oranges, or even BOTH... so at which point do you feel a pain ?
please enlighten us.  Do you realize the utopia behind your argument:  if  the world would go by your argument ("overtaking"),  you would always have regular CHANGES to the ONE coin  which represents the leading currency (leading as in analogy to what USD represents is in the fiat world). because there will ALWAYS be a "better" coin , a "better" tech. 
so for you one day it should be coin X, next day ohhh coin Y is better,  next week is coin Z better...  you realize that in world economic perspective, your view is totally flawed and illogical? YOur view is EXACTLY suitable for ALTCOINS but not for a store of value coin, where there must be only ONE (just as GOLD for your reminder!) Your view is moreover contrary to the very definition (provided in original post above) of what a leading store of value should be : 
***""a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future. In addition, also means high INDEPENDENCE, since gold can serve as a means of payment at ANY TIME.""***  
So, could you enlighten us, how you see a leading coin and store of value retaining purchasing power into the future, while being overtaken by another "better" coin, and so forth? 
***The whole cryptoworld changes the leading currency and store of value regularly ? feasibility==zero , logic==zero!***
a currency is a store of value. you have to educate yourself what a store of value means. in the fiat world gold is just the better store of value because it is LIMITED and cannot artifically be "printed".  but in the blockchain world, btc cannot be altered as a currency, in contrary to USD, and it is also limited. therefore, there is absolutely not any contradiction in btc being a currency. 
it is just the LEADING limited CURRENCY which is just like gold being "mined" at a cost, and therefore the PERFECT STORE OF VALUE! 
***not any other crypto coin has such a longstanding history, transaction history of hashes, security, developer quantity and quality, and most importantly MAINSTREAM, REGULATORY, GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL like BITCOIN...these are the very foundations that a leading currency and store of value in the cryptoworld should represent!***
***why dont you go and throw apple, google, IBM, Nike , etc. from their king's chairs? let me guess, because they are ESTABLISHED. Now guess what, BTC is established! So how twisted and illogical one must be to try pushing such a established coin out, instead of embracing it and working on THAT 10 years established history to make btc as the ONE leading coin and store of value even more secure and good! Because you must spend at least 20 years to built up another suitable store of value coin! just get it already that BTC Is the one, and focus on innovation with altcoins. the whole crypto is in its infancies! and you pretend to know  that btc is not "good" as the leading currency. 
***you sound like politicians, just pathetic. there is this 90% ready statue of liberty (aka bitcooin) in front of you, you just have to refine the head, maintain it and improve ON it, but instead you are crying and want sth else , starting from ZERO but you dont know what and how and why...***
