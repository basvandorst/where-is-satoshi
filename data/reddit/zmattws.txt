I bought at 19,750

That's good to know. I also have an account on Bittrex. If I move my BTC over there before the 25th, will that work?

It's actually called God, and it drops on the 25th. I have no clue how these drops work, but apparently you get the equivalent amount of God if you're holding Bitcoin. I also don't know if you need to be holding it somewhere for this to work. Any clarification would be appreciated.

Human: AI?
AI: Yes human?
Human: Can you design the perfect virtual currency?
AI: I'm sorry human, but I cannot do that
Human: Why not?
AI: Because it already exists
Human: What is it called?
AI: Bitcoin

Or people will take their money from crypto and put it into the stock market to buy the dip.

We should really thank him on his Twitter. He only has a handful of positive comments.

I don't want to hodl, but I have no way of knowing what the bottom is and so I do. Several times I've made the mistake of selling Alts only to see them shoot up again.

Yep, same with me. I put too much in during December when I first began, and don't have the cash reserves to average down more than once. When I see signs of a reversal, I'll go in one more time. Hodling strong only because I have no idea when the bottom will be.

Check out "The benefits of moderate beer consumption" by the Brewers of Europe. Filled with 100 or so references from peer reviewed articles. Beer fights cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, dementia, and it has fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It's also better at hydrating you than Gatorade.

Same here, only investing in altcoins. I believe that 75% or so are excellent picks. The rest I got through ICOs, and will probably not make it through next year.

Yup...I'm happy that I didn't sell then haha. I don't think I'm ready yet for crypto trading. All I can do at the moment is just accumulate the dips and sell when I'm happy enough with the profits.

I got in at $19750 on Coinbase. I also bought Litecoin at $318. I have the amazing ability to buy at EXACTLY the all time high of anything.

The volume is currently decreasing as I type this, and it looks to me like we're headed towards the next dip in a matter of 6-8 hours. Then again, I don't have the greatest track record of predicting drops.

Can it really be called an ATH when Tether was directly responsible for $10,000 of it's $20,000 peak?
