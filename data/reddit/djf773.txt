Yes - it does... a small amount is good... a small percentage of savings diversified into various investments and various cryptos is good.  Not that I'm offering any investment advice.

Greed - hard to fight the desire of quick money.

To be fair 3 years is a long time for people who jumped in with all their cash... people who didn't RTFM!
But your right... it isn't a long time to hold but the reason it drops so suddenly and quickly is partially due to panic sells by people who dumped everything in.

Yeah - that works! :)

There is always a pattern - when you set the time frame right...

Sad that we have to rely on the Kardashians to help with public adoption!

BTC has it's own exchanges though.... 
BTC is Gold+++

Hopefully people have learnt not to jump ship and panic sell each time it changes direction!

Not to mention the cost of your electricity.

For those who want a TL;DR;
From their homepage...
$2/day IF you have a top of the line GPU like a NVIDIA GeForce 1080Ti.

Any documentation of real-world use-cases yet?  Anyone using it for anything that could be considered "consumer" rather than tech-only?  
As it stands it is still very tech heavy and a fair way from easy to use for the every-day user...

Always will be the first to move (Up or Down)... others to follow

Will be interesting to see this pan out over the next few months... more and more people using BTC instead of Gold as a store of value

Malta leading the way for crypto here in Europe - and most of the world.
Government being very open to discussion and very friendly to crypto projects &amp; startups at the moment... Could well be a very good bet for Malta.  Tiny country but this could give them a big place in the growing crypto future.
