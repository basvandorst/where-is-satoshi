I wouldn't be happy if I only bought in at the top, either. Lashing out about it sucks though.
But then, if one can zoom out, and realize what direction we are headed in with working layer 2 Lightning, I dare say holding past 19k again won't even that bad a wait. A guess: a few months, tops. Noobs should be DCAing right now maybe a little harder than usual.
In any case, gotta distinguish the signal from the noise.

Lightning network rolling out on mainnet (lightning charge). I know, it's more of a test/beta version, only for the few self-chosen nerds, so far. But even so. Huge news. Bullish af on btc again (still) now. And we get a dip too? Too good. But alts... yeesh. Bearish af on those.

How is posting it once "spamming"?
If you can't see a certain value angle in such opinions, i'm afraid I won't be explaining.

Uh... what exchange allows funding from credit card?

From what I could ascertain $500 is the standard 'instant buy' credit/debit weekly limit unless you provide ID verification. And it maxes out at $1000 a week if you do provide ID. Though this may be old information. So how much higher are we talking for a possible instant buy limit? And did you provide a DNA sample?

$500 a week buy limit... pretty hard to buy a dip that lasts hours?

Did you have to go through ID verification?
