Why should anyone believe the current draft's omission of Bitcoin and permissionless blockchains is any indication of the actual goals of the project when previous drafts mentioned Bitcoin and permissionless blockchains?  (Why should we trust you, especially when previous documents mentioned Bitcoin?)
Why is Peter's assessment with regards to the attacks that could be performed wrong?  (This isn't about trusting MIT or not - assume any malicious actor with a similar proposal.)
What bottom-line benefit does such a project propose for end-users of Bitcoin, or anything else?  Why is a centralized authority (be it for real-world identity or anything else) suddenly a good idea for blockchain users, public or private?  To contrast, what potential benefit or is there for non-users, such as the central authority, governments, banks, etc?  Why should users subject themselves to such exposure?
I don't have much mining power myself, but I would never consort with any entity seeking to do such a thing, Bitcoin or "not Bitcoin".  The whole thing is shady as shit, and the rapid half-denials and damage control aren't making it look any better.

Yes to both.
The Lightning Network consists of you committing a transaction on the blockchain to move an amount of BTC to fund a separate account.
Then you transact via that separate account in the Lightning Network.  It'll be fast! It'll be cheap!!!
Then when you're done transacting on the Lightning Network, you and the parties you've opened channels with in the Lightning Network commit a separate transaction to close out that channel and return your BTC to the actual blockchain, putting it back in your control.
This is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
