In a precedent-setting case involving an unlicensed Bitcoin business whose owner advertised and completed some transactions in Maine, a Detroit man and his company were sentenced in U.S. District Court for the District of Maine on Monday for violations of federal law.

I believe he updated the graphic App to show all the levels of fees instead of generalizing 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:49
The transaction fee? Oh wait maybe not... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:45
That’s a flat fee. Unfortunate BTC fees on any significant amount is outrageous.

Well congrats- hedge your bets if need be but imho BCH is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:14:05
Bitcoin Cash already has... check out their roadmap. Try sending a transaction and see the ‘fees’

Because you don’t have your private keys. They technically own it. Just ask yourself, what if Coinbase website is not available at the time you’d like to exchange or cash out? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:38
You’re right. We should just use floppy disks too.

Learn the tech.. you won’t find yourself making such dumb statements 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:44:33
No soup for you!

I didn’t say it was acceptable. It’s not.. that’s why I use Bitcoin Cash for purchases and transfers. Fast, cheap and secure. Unfortunately, most HODL’rs will tell you to zoom out and stfu.

I could care less what people choose to invest in. Handle your business..  we can check the wins and losses later.. when your polishing my lambo!

If you own that much BTC then you probably understand the tech behind it and what it means for the future adoption of crypto. Or you would most likely already own he BCH from the fork.. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:59:15
Doesn’t that make it the past then?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:15:03
Actually it is being worked on as we speak. There is a company in Kennebunk Maine called Exochain that is working on ‘votem’

Lol oh the irony.

Exactly my point. Thanks for choosing to illustrate it. Congrats

I respect roger for the belief and hard work he has put in to Bitcoin. One could argue that his advocacy has profoundly impacted the adoption of Bitcoin. He has very valid points that I’ve not heard anyone refute with any certainty. You may disagree with his current course but at least respect the fact he puts his money and TIME in what he believes. Can you say as much?
