Venezuelan here. I read all the answers and some are right and some are completely wrong. 
To answer the question, I have to say Venezuelans get bitcoins from two sources, first there are the people who mine, as some has said electricity is really cheap so people started mining, even with a low end mining rig miners get enough income to live comfortably, 100 USD a month will cover all your basic needs. This is very risky since the government has started to track  miners to extort them. 
The second way people get bitcoins is buying it. What a lot of people are doing is basically when they get paid they convert part of their salary into btc, the currency lose it's value so fast that 15 or so days later when they need money, they convert back to VEF and the money didn't lose its value . 
That leads me to this very good question "who would sell bitcoins for Venezuelan currency?". You cannot buy food, or pay for services inside the country with another currency, so people who live in Venezuela still need VEF. So miners will sell their btc to cover for their needs, people who bought btc with their savings will sell btc to pay their expenses, and finally another big group of people, including myself, who don't live in Venezuela but send money to their relatives, buy bitcoins in whatever currency they have and sell it for VEF. Venezuela has a very strict currency control and it's really difficult to send dollars in, there is no western union and such, so using btc is a really easy way to help our relatives inside the country.
To completely answer the question : not everyone knows what bitcoin is, and most of people can't afford to use it, maybe 10% of the population knows about it, and no more than 1% or 2% use it. These are not official statistics, just numbers based on my circle of friends/family.
