I was sending it from core to coin base. It shows up on my transactions list in core still

I thought it was suppose to drop after 2 weeks? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:16:58
Of course it is going to look like this when you alter the time scale back. This goes for many tech companies as we have moved toward a more technical society

At this point it's worth a try, I'll give it a shot after work. Thank you

So what can I do besides wait because it will never get confirmed with the fee it has. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:08:53
Always something to learn lol. Alright thank you! I'll be stuck staring at the block chain waiting for it to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:11:36
Ok so with the difficulty rising ever higher, at that point the fees would be incredibly high to make up for all power needed to break a block (this also is just assuming technology doesn't move forward and make more efficient mining)?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:26:35
Better then paying a smaller fee and waiting 15+ and counting hours
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:06:26
Wow damn, couldn't that theoretically get stuck in limbo forever though?

20 sat/byte.  Found out later this is a lot lower then the normal right now :/
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:48:16
Was at work:  Same here.

Completely honestly I'm not 100% sure. I use it as a wallet, ability to send and receive, and try to rep it up to date on the network but that's about it

Be prepared to buy*
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:14
No fuck you, panic. /s
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:09
If it is 6k tomorrow I'm buying more

The value of anything takes in part of how much it takes to produce (I. E. The electricity) then the scarcity and then the added value based what on people think it is worth

GDAX is owned by Coinbase IIRC
edit: Fixed*
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:06:22
Neither

As a college kid, I can confirm this. But I am not reckless and stupid an take out loans to by a volatile currency. What goes up must come down
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:46:54
Exactly why I'm asking here. I don't think 10-100 uBtc every day is going to get me anywhere

Idk, it seemed to me when reading it that the writer tried putting it in a negative light
