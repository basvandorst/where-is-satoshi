That doesn't really make sense.. people who can afford to eat well will want to eat well just as they do now. 
People do hoard their wealth now anyway, they just don't keep it in cash - but invest it in other assets better suited for hoarding. They still like to eat out in restaurants and go on holidays though even at the cost of missing out on some of that hoarding action they could be doing by converting the cash into an investment instead of spending it at a restaurant.

I think this is actually a very good point. Salaries could be based in USD but paid in BTC to mitigate currency risk.
The problem is mainly that people aren't much use to each other.. especially for 'over the internet' jobs which is where bitcoin would be most useful. I'd guess if most people examine their personal lives they don't really hire many people to do anything for them - perhaps a babysitter now and again or some kid to mow their lawn.. maybe a plumber one in a while - but none of these can be done over the internet.
So far we have things like mail order soiled underwear and cam whoring..  the occasional contract writer and graphics artist or programmer..  
hmm.. maybe we could see some custom school paper / 'custom essay' writing services..?
any other ideas?

Hard to tell from the article - but maybe he added one of the javascript bitcoin miners to their website? That would explain the possibility of 'users being exposed'...
