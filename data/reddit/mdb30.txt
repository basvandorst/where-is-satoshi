Plazmotech would throw a tantrum if he saw this.

hahaha, it's funny because you can't sell text, only someone that is greedy would do so, which is very laugh-worthy. You're soooo clever.....
Why is adding "o"s into "so" makes it more obvious of how sarcastic you sound, let alone using the word "so"?

I miss the days where "tl;dr" didn't exist, they were called a summary, and it didn't need to identify as on, unlike "tl;dr", it will ALWAYS be accompanied with a sign for people to scroll down.

If this apparatus runs on facebook, then I wish I'd be laughing.

I know how you feel. I had like hundreds of BTC years ago, I didn't cash them out when they were worth at $200 per. I've regretted not cashing them out, it's not like I'm going to be using them as a currency, who the hell cares about it? Thousands of dollar could have been mine, with no hard work, cheap expenses, all I did was play around with a "revolutionary" online currency.

Prostitution with other bitcoiners. Or anything but mining.

What do you mean by difficulty? More cpu usage from your rig? How does the difficulty of mining bitcoin varies?

Hahaha, you're so funny because you didn't when you said "get a fucking job", you didn't mean it. How clever, what's your next unpredictable retort, does it involves "sense of humor"?

You make no sense.
