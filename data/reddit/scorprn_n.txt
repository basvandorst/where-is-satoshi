Hi is there any place showing the BTC/BRL price? If I understand, I can setup a Brazilian bank as distribution so my Bitcoins will be "transformed" to Brazilian Reais.
At the top of the page I seed BRL/USD. So if the user of Bitwage receives in USD would be that "flow"?
Bitcoin -&gt; USD -&gt; BRL

I'm wondering if that would be a good strategy:
1 - Create a wallet using TailOS + Electrum
2 - Store the seed on a safe place
3 - Import the public on my pc (which has internet connection) using Electrum
4 - Create transactions on my PC (online) and sign them on Tails (offline)
5 - Broadcast transaction on my PC
I'm not sure how this would be safe, but I think it's a good alternative to people that don't want to pay for a hardware wallet.
PS.: the wallet is never saved on TailOS, every time you will sign a transaction you should restore it by using the seed.

Sorry, I just realized that my question doesn't make much sense since I don't receive Bitcoins but USD.

You need to understand that isn't always possible to go 100% on BTC. Where I live is quite hard someone understand BTC or even believe it's real, so sometimes you got to use cards or exchange BTC for money. I live "on BTC" since June this year but even when I pay my bills I have to exchange my BTC for money (I think bitwala has a service like that). I never paid directly in BTC, unfortunately

Hi there,
I'm Brazilian and from my understanding of the tax laws you can safely buy the bitcoins using your money.
You can still declare it on tax form that you taxes won't be issued against this transaction. The only moment the tax will be issued is when you sell the bitcoins. At this moment, a 15% tax will be applied on profits (the difference of buy price x sell price).
Of course you have the option to buy the bitcoins and don't fill the tax form with this transaction, but if we are talking about a large amount and you later want to sell them to buy, lets say, a car, you need to explain from where the car's money came from.

You just need to worry about if someday you will bring that money back to Brazil. For example:
1 - Buy BTC with BRL
2 - Buy Pesos with BTC
3 - Buy BRL with BTC
In this case is important to report on tax form the first operation, so you won't have problem at all when executing the third operation.
