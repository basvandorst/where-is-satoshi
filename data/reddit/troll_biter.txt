You are mostly correct.
Your time from card swipe to money in bank is better than usual - most POS / Internet merchant solutions are not &lt;1 day from card sale to funds in bank. But let's go with "next day spendable" -  that's still Visa doing in hours what bitcoin can do in minutes. But let's go on. 
It takes ~60 days before you are no longer liable for chargebacks.
From an accounting point of view, that money isn't 100% *yours* until that period is over. You remain at risk of fraud the whole time, and that costs you money whether you account for it or not.

Beautifully said. Agree 99%
Bitcoin XT is not an alt coin and shouldn't be labeled as such for the purpose of squelching debate. 
At this point it is no longer about 1MB vs 8MB. It's about providing users / miners with choice. 
The ability for anyone to write a superior Bitcoin client that cannot be blocked / captured by special interests is exactly why Bitcoin is so important. 
I would suggest unsubscribing from this sub and subscribing instead to one of the other Bitcoin subs like or at least until policy changes.

Exactly. The drawing is incorrect and reflects a misunderstanding of either terminology or Bitcoin itself.
Altcoins literally don't exist until after the fork occurs. No fork, no alt. If I'm wrong then can please point me to the existence of any altcoins created by XT so far. He can't because no alt coins exist.
After the fork occurs, then whichever client is mining the short chain will be producing coins not recognized by the economic majority. That coin will be the "altcoin" to Bitcoin, which is by definition the longest chain deriving continuously from the Genesis block.
Since XT will not produce a fork unless it has a mining majority, XT will only fork if it will produce the longest chain, and thus XT *cannot produce an altcoin.*

No, *you* reread section one. 
"or has materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy... of the United States"
You make it sound as though this document limits the President's authority. It does not. It is very very broad and includes all of those things you mention plus "whatever else we find threatening."

Bitcoin's promise is that the money and its rules and incentives will be determined by majority vote on the chain with the most work.
That is literally the only promise Bitcoin makes. Read the code! Read the white paper! Everything else is up to vote by majority rule on the blockchain. There is literally no other promise. 
If an economic majority wishes to make itself poorer by changing the inflation schedule, then they absolutely can and will do that. There is neither a prohibition against it not even the possibility of creating a prohibition against it. The **only** thing that prevents it is that a majority would not rationally choose to do this.
If you want Bitcoin to be different, take your own advice and start an alt. Or at least have the intellectual honesty to just be up front about your disagreement with the original design and intent of the blockchain and we can have this debate in the open instead of couching it in terms of the block size limit.

You make it sound like code comes from on high. I couldn't care less about Gavin or Mike or Greg or any of them. They don't control anything. Anyone can run any client they want. And they should.
That's how Bitcoin consensus works.

Only in North Korea and is "providing choice" equated with "hostile."
The changes are obviously hostile to the goals of the Bitcoin Core team. Whether they are hostile to the goals of *Bitcoin* are to be decided by the marketplace. If Core is displaced by another client because people prefer it, then the only thing that could be construed as hostile would be any attempts to thwart its free adoption.

The code that dictates that if ~51% of us don't like MAX_BLOCK_SIZE then we can fork the ~49% of you off the chain and there isn't anything you can do but complain. The same code that prevents Iran or IBM or you from capturing the code base altogether. 
It's not surprising that you are just now coming to grips with how Bitcoin works. You display profound misunderstandings of Bitcoin's design. Your autocratic tendencies, outright opposition to majoritarianism (a key Bitcoin principle), and constant attempts to revise original design are quite obvious. 
Man, if you don't like the way Bitcoin works, take your own advice, and start an alt.

Where I live, over six million people have access to 300/30Mbps Internet as part of their home cable Internet plan.
An almost completely decentralized (except geographically) infrastructure running full 20MB blocks could easily be completely supported if *only people in my home town* could effectively mine.

The problem is, the big moving van is one that everyone has a say in driving. Also since all the bills are small its hard to steal them all.

Big block Bitcoin transactions are still Bitcoin transactions. Payment layer transactions that settle in bitcoin are not Bitcoin transactions but transactions on another network using some other money. Whether that money is backed by Bitcoin is irrelevant, it isn't actually Bitcoin and users aren't transacting Bitcoin.

BIP 101 is necessary to preserve Bitcoin's inherent freedoms. Choice and growth are essential to the survival of the currency.
Every miner has a responsibility to reject Bitcoin Core in favour of any other alternative client not controlled by a cabal of special interests.

Then you are anti-bitcoin, though you may not know it.
These things are all contrary to the vision of Bitcoin outlined in Satoshi's white paper.

No. If Satoshi had meant for miners not to be able to change the consensus rules he would not have built an open permissionless system.
If the consensus rules are governed by any identifiable group of people then the entire network is trivial to capture. Just hire all the developers and pay them to rewrite Bitcoin. Hmm.
The fact that anyone can write a client and overtake the network through outright hashpower is precisely what makes the development process impossible to capture. 
I understand why you and your friends don't like this, because it threatens your perceived hegemony as the gatekeepers of Bitcoin. It is frustrating to learn that something you thought you controlled, you don't control.

He thinks "Bitcoin" is "the code that Peter, Greg, etc" wrote and anything else isn't Bitcoin, and that makes it an "attack." It's a common error. 
You can't blame him, most lay people don't really understand how Bitcoin's consensus / voting mechanism works.

Sidecoins != Bitcoins
Like we've been saying, you're here posing as helping Bitcoin while actually pitching an as-yet-to-be-developed alt.
I consider any layer that stands between me and my bitcoin as a direct threat to my money and I will respond as such.
I consider any arbitrary capacity limit to be a threat to my money and I will respond as such.

Actually I might argue that the minority chain isn't part of a network. Without majority hashpower, its just miners making blocks that don't mean anything any more.
All a blockchain can tell us verifiably is what the majority agreed to. It can't say anything at all about what the minority voted on. The reason for this is that a fork with minority hashpower is no longer tamper resistant. So the information contained within its blocks is no longer meaningful. Only the information contained in the longest chain retains it's original meaning, and therfore, value.

Satoshi clearly says that "any needed rules and incentives" can be enforced by a majority vote of miners voting with their CPU:


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work onthem. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
Seems clear from here.

So some guys get together and produce a document that describes the current protocol /consensus rules perfectly as they exist today.
What possible value does that serve?
**Actionable**  changes to the protocol are proposed through code and voted on by executing the code. Anything else is just moldy 20th century style politics masquerading as governance. It's irrelevant.

You have to consider the networking effects. You're thinking B-B like "importer - exporter".
But it isn't just B-B. It's B-B-B-B-B-B-C. Where the Bs are Producer /Distributor /Exporter /Importer /Distributor /Retailer /Customer. Maybe even some shipping companies in there too. The point is the value chain is much longer than just two companies. 
In each step there is competitive advantage in eliminating payment cycle times and transfer costs. And it isn't just cost: Bitcoin transfers in minutes what can take banks days. That time is money.
So the exporter has an incentive to get his suppliers to accept Bitcoin and on down the line to the producer. And the importer has the same incentive all the way to the merchant. And there are already well known merchant advantages for accepting Bitcoin.
Point is that the only value that any of the players in a fully fledged Bitcoin value chain *can* convert to fiat is their profit and overhead since most of their their variable costs are paid in Bitcoin. So then there is an incentive to pay wages in Bitcoin and retain some profits in Bitcoin.
You can see where this is going.
