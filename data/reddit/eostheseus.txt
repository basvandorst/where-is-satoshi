If allowing the banks to steal wealth from U.S. citizens is 'sophisticated' then yes, I guess we are the opposite.

I'd only be guessing if told you a certain month or year. Global debt is way larger now than it was during the gfc so all we need is one of the hubs in the global financial network to fail to trigger a collapse. Think a bank going into receivership (Deutsch bank) or a country defaulting on its debt (Italy). If you see news headlines stating something like this you will know the next recession has already begun.

The US will have stagflation, which is manageable as long as national debt is not outrageous. Unfortunately national debt is 21 trillion and can only go up. No one will want USD, bonds backed by USD will crash, the US will have a currency crisis. Banks will bail in. Depositors will want to withdraw their money. Banks will preempt this by 'closing their doors' to prevent a run. This will cause a correction in the global economy, definitely a recession, probably a depression.
