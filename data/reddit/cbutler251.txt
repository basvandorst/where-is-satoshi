So as of now... Googles beta testing is by far better than most...although, if you're just looking to make money, it can be made in every imaginable scenario using crypto currency. .. ~~Banks~~

Personally, I calculate myself losing anywhere from 2-5 btc... .2 being lost yesterday using shapeshift and jaxx. :(

Wait, won´t  all coins eventually find there way back to the original owner who lost them?

Here's solid advice!

Here's an idea from somebody who literally started at 0$ 4 years ago and found out the hard way...
 Buy bitcoin through coinbase or mycelium or a bitcoin atm. Now, the only thing about buying it from coinbase is that you have up your limits before purchasing that much BTC..
 Mycellium has no limits besides the seller selling. Bitcoin Atm has no limits either. So you may pay around a 2-7% fee which is ok but not economical unless you are already familiar with the ropes. So once you buy into BTC , whichever wallet or software you decide to run with, and write down the private, public, apis, brainwallet, etc.. ,  onto non-biodegradable paper and lock it away ( there are numerous ways to store your keys and if you are familiar with it, get creative, other than that you should always keep these alphanumerics hidden.
 Now you can either trade or store it. Personally, I would invest, store, read,read,read,and read some more.
 I jumped into the exchange without really knowing the math behind it and would steadily lose, lucky for me I was only trading in pennies until I figured out the math and value. 
Simplest solution... mining contracts through Genesis or another reputable mining company. Don't even mess with a bank but just buy the contracts straight through Genesis. Why? Because you will get a daily payout, you will have everything you need ( for the most part ), you will have support....AND you can mine other altcoins through x11 contracts, which is what I would be mining, allowing you to take to the exchange and sell for bitcoin.
If you follow the later of the strategies, make sure to ask around and question what you shall mine. :D Namaste~!

Aa are the only 2 problems I see when it comes to the sentence above.. "A PROBLEM WITH PROOF OF STAKE AND COIN VOTING IN GENERAL.... IT ALLOWS THE MASSES TO BACK THEIR / AND STORE THEIR   PROBLEM 1 AND ONLY ARE THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 11:22:12
No I didn't... I just through it alongside several other lost wallets! No worries. :)

First thing people will run to is bitcoin but I think the true value lies in satoshi.
