So who can confirm they havent sold BCH on peak this weekend with the intention to publish this news now?  
  
Its a joke theyre even holding the coins back!

You seem to have it all figured out then!  
  
I even said "Its &gt;EITHER&lt; ...". I believe the incompetence story is the more probable. Just playing devils advocate and tbh, there is literally nothing Ver &amp; Co could do that would even remotely surprise me.

Oh and how about the people that cant afford any security?  
  
Just because in america the situation is fucked, doesnt mean its everywhere. Most parts of western and central europe have a functioning police force.

Why are you talking about politics? Sure theres corruption everywhere, dont try to shift the focus.  
  
Im saying our police doesnt shoot people because they are poor, of color or for minor offenses. Concerning the western world, thats an american problem.  
  
We have already seen where private, uncontrolled and unchecked security forces with big money lead us with mercenaries in the middle eastern wars of the last decades.  
  
You responded to me saying that companies and people wouldnt hire a security guard that raped someone. There is precedent that they actually do. there isnt any more to this argument.

I see your faith in humanity is quite high.. Im sure there are people who would fight for rapists and murderers for the right price.

They are either incredibly incompetent or ridiculously smart. Maybe 2x was never supposed to actually happen and was part of the bch agenda?  
  
At least 2 crippling and at the same time easy to spot bugs that would prevent it from going live? What if its a failsafe?
