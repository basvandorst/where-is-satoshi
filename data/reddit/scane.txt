Well, it's The Economist. My personal expierence with them is overall great. They really do research and everything is written very well in my opinion. Thanks for sharing.

You can update but you must change the Bitcoin directory in the Armory Settings to the new one (C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\daemon). 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:21:02
Same problem here. Did you got any news about it?
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:30:23
Here is my feedback: It simply does not work. I added my credit card, tried add 10$ to my account -&gt; Error, please try again or contact support.
So I tried to add my Bank Account -&gt; "wrong bank code".
Can't share the enthusiasm at all...
I'm from Germany btw.

How and when does a transaction qualify as free?

I have read on bitcointalk.org that this is rather common and not an actual virus. I ignored the virus and continued to use Armory. You might just want be sure yourself. Never trust internet strangers :p

I can't find the videos he is talking about. Like the GUI one or anything.

Services such as Xapo and Circle are shit because they use Bitcoin not the way it is intented to be used...
How can so many of you really think that the standard Limitation of Liability clause that you find in every terms ever will rescue them in a court (or even is intented to) if they got hacked or whatever crap can happen? Of course everything in their "Vault" is insured 100% as the terms cleary state....... with or without shitty standard clause..  This community sucks.

Makes sense now. I didn't know you could create a public address yourself without getting the private key for it.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:11:47
Yes, no idea what those are and why I am getting them.
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:11:25
What is this address and why does it exist?
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:17:17
Thanks but who confirms or ensures that nobody knows the private key?
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:19:37
So do I need to update now to take advantage of this?
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:12:19
You should read the whole article. They point out the problem just as it is and understand that this bug is known since 2011 and is and should have been easily fixed by major players like Mt.Gox.

= exchange from BTC -&gt; $ = BTC Price Down
Neteller provides a fast service to change BTC to $. If you would like prices to go up you would need a popular service doing it the other way round.

So you are saying that Keynes was insane?
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:49:16
It does a little bit ;) thank you all.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:37:39
Hm, but there are a lot of very risky investments out there. Since when are central banks your financial investement guides? That is why I think it's a defensive statement. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:43:21
I was on the move but I still wanted to give you a complete answer.
I didn't get why you mentioned how many bitcoins you, if you were a central bank, might have would still not influence you about making a warning of bitcoins but I do now.
 All I can say to you is, I'm sorry. You are ignorant if you really think they warn you just to help you not loose all your money. Well, or maybe you don't know much about bitcoins, or/and banks. Whatever... You will see more steps against bitcoin in India yourself soon. And what is wrong with your behavior? Putting words in my mouth that I say RBI is corrupt and then blaming me for not providing any proof. You have read my comments wrong.
 How about you, give at least an example of your own points. Why do you think RBI would warn people of new currencies? Are you agreeing with the stated risks or what is your point, at all? At least explain yourself instead of "you got to be kidding". Next time just downvote if you have nothing to say in an argument.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:36:25
Yea, might be the case. It's a good point.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:32:40
German state owned channels are supposed to be not influenced by the state. I mean who knows and all but don't compare it to a china state owned TV channel I guess ;)

Much more, he lost about 290 BTC for the chance to win 0.16 ..
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:12:55
No you can't. Or at least I can't. I tried it and it always forces me a fee of 0.0001
@_date: 2013-07-21 17:38:36
I don't care which word is being used. Hording or saving. He just said that Keynes used the word saving and right after that that nobody sane would believe that saving is harmful to the economy. This is what I think is wired due to the fact that Keynes was encouraging spending instead of saving for an economy which is struggling. Therefore my question to him: Is he saying Keynes was insane?
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:23:22
I don't really get what it is saying because google transalte sucks. But there is massive sell off in China right now. Is it related to this news?

What is Tigerdirect.com and why am I being denied accesing their page?

Dear central bank of India,
Thank you very much for warning me of the risks in decentralized VC holding and trading. I have now fully realized that I am the only one responsible for my digital money. This really scares me, because even as an adult I think I am not responsible enough to manage my own finances. I will immediately change and let you manage this money stuff for me so I can feel save and asured that never again I have to fear robbery, hyperinflation, legal status or such shameless things as money laundering with the help of my savings. History has proven that I can safely lay all my trust in you!
Edit: Thank you for the gold! :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:53:18
This does not work. When you make a transaction after you changed the  fee in the preferences the client will inform you that you still need to pay a minimum fee of 0.0001. You can then either accept or cancel the transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:54:49
Never had any problems so far. I've been trading there for about 1 year now.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:27:04
Well I think that lower transaction fees make a currency more useful and therefor more valuable. I can't prove that and to do so or even to quantify the fee effect for the BTC/USD ratio you would certainly need a professional, if even possible. I don't think it is but I guess you may ask in @_date: 2013-12-02 14:36:56
This was simply amazing.
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:47:32
Really? OK.
A corrupt financial institute does not prevent, but rather increase "...potential financial, legal and security related risks.". Warnings by such institutes are therefore ironic.

Does Coinbase work outside the US?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:17:25
When I try setting the fee below 0.0001 and make a transaction it states that I'd require a fee of at least 0.0001. Am I doing it wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:29:59
Do you know any client that is not forcing fees currently? I tried Bitcoinqt, Multibit and Armory.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:10:12
Yes they have, it's down 100€ as of now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:31:01
If you are in the EU you can use 
They verify you by SEPA transaction of 0.63 €cent or something. Works almost instantly and you can start trading. Feel free to use my reference link above if you choose to register, else

I think I do not really get your question.
If I understand you correctly, you ask if banks are reducing the amount of money by fees? If so:
No, the money the bank gets by fees is simply their income. You basically give them part of your money for their transfer service. The money does not disapear but changes its owner.
Further more banks are not only not reducing the available money, they are increasing it. I only know the correct german term for it but you can call it "money creation by banks (not central banks)".
Allow me to use this example for an explanation:
Say you give 1000$ to your bank (your account). The bank now is allowed to use this money for giving out credits. They use 500$ of your money, and give it to Mr. B. You still have your 1000$, but Mr. B all of a sudden also can spent 500$. Those 500$ came out of nowhere (because you still can withdraw your 1000$ from the bank, not 500$ from bank 500$ from Mr.B) or in other words were simply "created" by your bank.
This is also the reason for if everyone at once would demand their savings from their bank, the banks would not be able to deliver and simply close/freeze accounts.
After reading yet again.... I think you are just asking if a currency able to do payments without fees is more valuable than one that has fees for each transaction. Leaving out all the other factors that may influence the value of a currency: yes sir, you are right. Right now we need a bank to do a transfer so we pay them to do so.
Please tell me if this answers anything at all haha

Do I have a vote as a holder of bitcoins? Or who does?
@_date: 2013-07-21 19:30:52
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:46:47
Hey man I didn't state anywhere that they are corrupt. Just that they can be and I explained to the question what corruption has to do with security concerns. 


This quote of me is independent of corruption and if I were this bank I surely would "warn" the people of India, too. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:47:31
No, they are warning of Bitcoin because it competes with their services and has the potential to make them obsolete. So, there is your gain. No conspiracy theory needed, sorry. Ironic is, they are warning with security risks which they too, fail to solve. **On top of that**, the centralized form of it makes it vulnerable to corruption, regardeless if it is currently, or not. Aaand as I stated, corruption increases the potential risks. Try again Mr. Obvious.
