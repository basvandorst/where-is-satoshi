BIGbtc.ca has purchased SKYHOOK ATM's and is excited to roll out a RENTAL program in Canada and soon in the USA. Merchants in Mississauga can view the SKYHOOK ATM at our upcoming  event July 8  Restaurant at Square One.  US Merchants can view the SKYHOOK in Florida in December at our  event  Restaurant South Fort Myers.
We luv ATM's and believe they are crucial to merchant adoption. 
Look for a press release from BIGbtc.ca in the near future.

CaVirtex is not a scam. Completely legit company. Also Vault Of Satoshi is totally legit.  Careful on LBC, connect with a hi profile user and stay safe.

Its great you're interested in the technology enough to reach out and here is the right place to start. There are some other FL Attorneys that have some breadth of knowledge in Bitcoin. I am unsure of how any of the crypto technologies will impact the legal profession. 
Check out another FL Attorney  ,  Chris is a pretty smart guy.
We are having a Bitcoin VIP Merchant Shindig in Fort Myers  Dec 16 if you are on the Gulf side join us to talk Bitcoin.
