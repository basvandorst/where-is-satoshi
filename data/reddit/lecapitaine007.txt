I've been following bitcoin for a while now, but it's just recently that I finally decided to invest in it (I know, I fucked up!).
Thanks for the answer!

Thanks for the reply!
Is this legit, is there a lot of people that use this as a way to make money, or is it more the type of things for newcomers that don't have money to spend on bitcoins but still wants some?

Thanks for the reply!
The main reason I asked, is because I'm still fairly new to it. So what do you suggest? Is it worth it to install Bitcoin-Qt (taking so long...) then use Armory as a cold storage. Or is the installation not worth it and just use a paper wallet?
Thank You!

Put in this way, I do believe it's a waste of time. Was just wondering if there was some type of way to make a decent amount through these websites. I guess not!
Thank You!

Yeah, I guess when you're new to it, it feels more like a game, trying to get anything that you can, but then you realize it is money and clicking on website for one hour for like 25 cents isn't worth it.
Thanks again!

I love this! Where was this?

He said he took about $50,000 out.

Can you guys wait for me?! I'm trying to reach 1 BTC before the space shuttle leaves.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:09:21
All I need for my first whole one is 0.70 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:53:54


Every time the price went up I had a choice to make, wait until it goes back down or buy more. I always bought more and until now it has been profitable. But who knows...

It's Kevin O'Leary stacking up!
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:35:43
Good luck. ~~If~~ When it makes it to the moon, you'll be able to buy back the whole block.
But for me I'm keeping it safe, buying "small" amounts every week.

$3800 WOOTTT WOOTTT
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:42:40
And when is that?
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:38:10
I'm a simple man. When I see "pm your wallet", I pm my wallet.

True. We had a similar place in my city. I tried going in last week and they're closing, selling everything (tables, chairs, etc.).
I think they are still operational, but online only.
Edit: BUT... I think the value with those places are in attracting new customers. Those types that are curious about the technology but afraid to make the first step.
These places make it seem more "official".

For real lol. Should I move on with my bitcoin-less life or is the bitcoin god going to bless me in this rainy day.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:25:51
Are you still going through them or you said f*ck it?
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:30:11
Shhh... Don't reveal my plan.
Just kidding. That't the Average-Cost Method right?
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:43:08
And baristas
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:25:52
Yes, that's the one I was looking for. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:11:51
Same. It would of sucked if I was day trading but I'm not, so I'm just gonna wait until it reaches an amount low enough and buy more. When it goes up, and it will go up, I'll be just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:37:31
Life changing decision.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:04:07
So we can buy more.
