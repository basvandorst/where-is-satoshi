Just look at the graph this time last year. There was a huge dip at the same time, then we built back up

I'm new here, is the other sub @_date: 2018-01-04 01:44:20
While I am whole heartedly against racism, I've got to disagree here. They're making a statement about appearance based purely on appearance. It's not like claiming Christians are hotter. That person just likes how that skin tone looks.

I'm up voting not because I agree, but beaches that's the most logical thing I've read on this sub.

So far, he's still right :(

Myself as well, you have my gratitude.

Provocative name, stating blatantly unpopular opinions, outright lying. Stop feeding the troll, folks!
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:43:58
I mean,  you still can.

Only within the bitcoin community for the most part. That means people will only hear about a service they don't use already or they do use and switch away.

Oh no, I'm only up 15% instead of the 30% I was expecting!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:50:57
I don't know more than the next guy, but it's pretty much analyzing the patterns, guessing, and hoping you guessed right. Knowing what you're talking about just gives you more tools to improve your guess and explain it better.

It's expected to continue rising. As to why not sell during peaks and buy again during dips, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:43:35
Forgot to switch accounts or...?
edit: I've been discovered. Better luck next time!

Nobody knows the situation like you do as we weren't there, but the way you described it, I think has you pinned.

Gemini hasn't looked at my verification since the 20th. Last month!!!

I don't get why people lose their minds everytime it dips. We didn't even hit 10k

I'm being told bitcoin purchases are currently disabled, is this a global thing? If so, how long will it last? If not, how do I fix it?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:51:10
I just got into crypto earlier this week. I bought $10 with Coin base just to satisfy myself and so I could start figuring things out on a safe scale. Since then I've learned coin base is on the higher end in terms of fees. Is there a less expensive way to buy bitcoin with credit or debit?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:04:35
You started with $100? or $10?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:48:26
Coin base was down for a little while last week and it usually takes some time to get your coin, but it's really as simple as using any other online shop.

I think he meant it's fiat in that it is based solely on supply and demand.

Wait so which one were you? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:14:46
Oh I misread that as up TO $40 lol
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:41:53
Made 6% ROI over 4 months. Happy, but I was definitely set up with exaggerated expectations

Then you're playing some really weird poker. What casino, tournament etc. is going to move everyone to a unique position every single hand?

Up more than $2,500 in less than a day. Here's to hoping this keeps up.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:46:04
There is a strategy that does exactly this. Hyper agressive players can play hands without looking at their cards (obviously they won't because that can still impact some decisions). They can do this by knowing exactly how to push someone out of a hand based purely on their past hands.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:45:18
They must have just implemented some kind of automation to do the entire queue really fast
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:02:59
You joke, but this could certainly be true now or soon.

Price just jumped $600 in about 30 minutes.

It already did didn't it?

You don't need to be a good trader to be lucky, but you have to have some amount of luck to be a good trader

This sub is for memes. Anyone who thinks otherwise is at risk of making a lot of bad trades (i.e. me 2 months ago)

No, you have to *buy* him. Then sell him when his family inevitably increases demand.
