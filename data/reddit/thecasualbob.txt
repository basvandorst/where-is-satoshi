Privateinteretaccess logs the shit out of you if you didn't know. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:30:18
Why the fuck would you want that. How can something that comes with a risk of losing your money can gain mass adoption? But of course, the speculants will say the opposite. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 09:42:44
I want some, umm... *sniff* you know... *sniff*... sushi.
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:31:19
I never stole anything, they were giving it for free. Thats like having a bunch of people take the free candy which are at banks and other places then making them deliver it all to me.
@_date: 2014-10-19 10:43:35
You could register there with any email, didn't need a valid email, the bot just made a bunch of asdhash accounts and such. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:14:43
I am. Sadly, I am.
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:35:06
Im not a fan of either or because both of these subs have their idiots and people with good opinions. People like post some good arguments, while others just troll because they got nothing to do. But the fanatics of bitcoin, uhh...
Hail Bitcoin!

Why is Bitcoin dying?
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:38:05
They are all real tho. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:13:20
Not decentralised enough, 2/10.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:05:10
So much cringe. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:52:48
He should return it to BCI with a deal that they change their name to something else.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:54:25
They warned long ago.
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:46:02
They can crash it as easily aswell.
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:02:56
Is it safe to use the wallet now? 
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:34:43
tfw a troll gets upvoted on @_date: 2014-10-31 17:42:51
Who is this ''Skype'' guy?
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:19:39
According to Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:48:49
Not everyone who has a bit of critical thinking is a troll. Without those people Bitcoin won't go anywhere.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:38:54
So random xdDD
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:30:25
Haha, okay, thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:27:43
Note that it always shows the prices only in Euros to me, and after refreshing it was all in EUR. Must have been some kind of a glitch.
Edit: Also the offer of that person is showing 0,74€, no idea why it showed 30.52 BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:59:21
Same here. :(
Being a 16 year old with $1850 in Bitcoin is a bit scary, because its all i got. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:51:27
Come on guys, this is the most obvious tip bait i have seen on this sub. Stop throwing money at him. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:43:56
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:52:07
I didn't invest it. Bitcoin is simply my only option for recieving payments. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:31:59
Someone isn't ''madly generous'' only because they don't tip 1% of a penny. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:35:34
HAHA DAE DECENTRA[LE]SED  FUTURE??
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:02:11
It says ''boot'' not ''cool''. What the fuck dude.
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:54:38
If someone dislikes a certain thing about this community, he doesn't understand Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:28:59
but the bitcoins wouldn't be confirmed by miners, right?
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:25:56
Just checking some.
Also, maybe there is a way i could check all the addreses for bitcoins automatically? 
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:22:39
bitcoin - cheap discounts amirite guise? just give us 40% of lol xDDDDDDD
@_date: 2014-10-26 06:58:39
Thing is, i am holding because it is the only payment system i chose to accept (not 18, never using paypal) and i have to keep the money a secret. Sucks, i know.

Im from Latvia, i remember it being on some news site months ago.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:45:16
Did i hear tips? 
@_date: 2014-07-20 08:07:03
Because of some geeks posting online? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:38:26
Ignore shit posts like OP. I tought the ''annoy the fuck out of every company'' thing was over.
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:29:48
Haha, i remember when i made a bot that registered on gambit.com and transfered the free 0.001 (or was it 0.0001?) to an account on which i cashed out after. Got 7 bitcoins overall with that. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:41:25
Fuck those pedophiles ar Microsoft, Dell and Newegg. Fuck them. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:16:19
Is that why people beg to chineese pools to accept it?
@_date: 2014-10-19 07:37:21
is leaking. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 09:52:53
In this moment I am euphoric, not because of any phony Federal Reserve, but because i am enlightened by my highly encrypted and secured bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-11 11:55:57
Whooooo, new cult members! 
ONE OF US, ONE OF US!
@_date: 2014-07-25 11:49:28
Sad that you will get downvoted, but you simply said the truth. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 10:04:05
Cringe. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:48:17
Implying that Bitcoin isn't crashing. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:56:30
Coinbase and Circle have an important role. That is where the average Joe is able to buy his coins. 
You can't expect him to go 100% anonymous, encrypted and scream ''DECENTRALISATION IS FUTURE, HAIL BITCOIN''. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:57:55
Yet a lot of ''hurrr durrr ponzi scheme'' is still there. Both these subs have their idiots.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:18:30
What is the link? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:39:27
Frankeh has solid arguments, Rub3X or w/e his name is, yeah no doubts imagining him making those retarded sounds while he types. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:05:57
You can still check somehow.
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:39:17
If the dollar colapses, will it matter how much USD a Bitcoin costs?
And what will it be compared to then? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:41:34
Sent from blockchain.info wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:49:54
Idk how to do that, sent it from blockchain, thats it. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:17:34
Shhhh, don't question the cult. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:14:19
Wow, thank you :)

I got no problem with homosexual people, but trans people make me sick.
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:35:06
Been waiting for more than 35 blocks. 
Have had transactions go through quicker with 0.00001 fee. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:03:35
And the award of the best cult member of this sub goes to... @_date: 2016-12-22 15:07:25
Hope that they will help sorting this out. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:56:49
Funny because i got $20k+ in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:25:37
Its an experiment. It is still a thing. Will it be a thing in 5 years? Who knows.
Dont believe every comment on this subreddit, a lot of people have a very cult-ish vibe here. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:53:32
Problem is the receivers blockchain wallet has no money. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:55:16
How does he dare to provide facts! 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:42:59
Yeah, lets put a link to bitcoin.com! /s
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:25:35
Yes it makes sense. 
He shorted BTC with profit. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:45:21
There was a mail.com exploit (worked on gmx aswell) where you could change almost any accounts password by simply playing around with the ''Tamper data'' Firefox add-on.

The marketplace is ''RAMP'' if i remember correctly.
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:24:56
gives solid advice!
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:15:11
''According to AML and KYC regulations, in order to increase your card limits, your documents must be verified''
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:27:57
Russians are heavily brainwashed, don't think that they will follow that mentality. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 20:48:11
all i would need is a visa/mastercard that i can put $10 in with BTC. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:46:30
Stop killing your GPU. You won't make any money.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:49:44
See, bitcoins can only be used to buy DRUGS!
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:12:46
Bullshit, signed up, added $10, made a card. 
Gives some error that its not possible to add balance to my card atm and after relogging and clicking ''top up'' it asks me to verify myself. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:45:06
of course.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:18:47
What i always notice in this sub, is bitcoin enthusiasts explaining bitcoin to newbies with such terms that all they can say is ''yes'' and not understand shit. 
John and Bob doesn't care how their banks work, they don't care what encryption it uses, whats the security, how the payments are proccessed, or the technical aspects of PayPal. They want to know if they can send money easily or no. 
That is it. Simple as that.
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:49:22
Atleast we know it, haha.

And how will you deal with cheaters? 
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:53:25
Wait, is it really that much cheaper for them to accept BTC?
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:30:23
And they do reduce violence for the average buyer and seller.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:36:01
This will help proving that isn't a cult!
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:28:29
Also, their shop accepts Bitcoin for merch and supplements, which is cool.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:14:58
Talking about CSGO. Also, a blacklisted cheater won't make someone get his money back...
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:29:51
Not that, i just couldn't find any info on what PayPals fees are exactly etc. Its like 3%? But i need to know for sure. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:43:08
I tought this wasn't just meant to be played with ''friends'', it could be anyone who wants to play for money.
