The cost of software development is real. SegWit is complicated, and a lot of companies don't want to support it. I would guess that they probably think adopting BCH is cheaper and more effective. We'll see I guess.

You CAN spend your bitcoins on some things. If you really want to support bitcoin you should get a wallet and a small amounts worth of bitcoin (few hundred?) Of money you'd normally spend buying things online. Whenever you want to buy a specific thing try to find a way to buy it with bitcoin before trying fiat.

You do realize that credit cards (and paypal) charge "competitive rates" of 2.5% to the merchants, right? Bitcoin's transaction fee is virtually free and payment processors like bitpay are incredibly low-cost (something like 1%-0.3%)
You've also never tried to wire money internationally. 10-15 business days and 30-100$ in charges and fees. It's completely ridiculous.


Bottom line is that if you have to ask, you don't really seem to understand the advantages of bitcoin over current modern payment methods. Credit cards and Paypal pretty much have the monopoly over non-cash payment systems and charge outrageous fees to merchants. Paypal often freezes merchant accounts on whims which can seriously destabilize businesses and are general dicks. More places accepting bitcoin means healthy competition and potentially lower charges for credit cards and so on.
In peer to peer money transfer (as in, non-business transaction); bitcoin is absolute king. How would you send 1000$ to a friend? A cheque? Online services often cost 5-10$ to do those kind of transactions. Cash is much more risky, who wants to carry that much money on them? 
You do seem to have good ideas, but if you don't get excited when big players start accepting bitcoin, you really can't see the bigger picture. That's like asking what the advantage of email is over regular mail back in the early 90s. Who *actually* wants to get a personal computer? It's expensive, new and scary. You need *internet*. It's just a fad.

That's not what that means. That simply means no capital gain or have to calculate the change in value between the time you get Bitcoin and use it to buy other things.
Basically how you don't pay capital gains or losses because the value of the USD (or EUR) shifts by the time you gain it/spend it.

No, and I wouldn't recommend it. The entire point of E2EE (end to end encryption) is that only you and the person you're communicating with have the keys to decrypt the messages. I looked at Owncloud and while they do encrypt data *in transit* (which is basically the same as https/ssl). They don't use E2EE, meaning that your data is sitting unencrypted on their databases, either that OR they encrypt the database but also keep the encryption keys.
What this all means is that if owncloud gets hacked, or gets a call from any three letter agency; your data is no longer yours.
Open source software and E2EE is the only way to fully take control of your information.
With Snowden's revelations, anytime you go through an untrusted (anything that isn't open source and/or peer reviewed) third party - your data can and will be snooped on by various governments.

"Btrash" actually has a lot of awesome scaling innovations going on right now, namely graphene  and optimizing the single-threaded aspect of signature validation. The two big bottlenecks of scaling Bitcoin (burst bandwidth for block propagation and CPU cycles needed to validate big blocks quickly). You should definitely check out the two talks from scaling bitcoin by Peter rizun and the other one for graphene.

I mean sure, but also the amount of money poured into the economy is also halved, assuming that demand stays the same, prices will rise (maybe not instantly - but they should). Block reward halving does not reduce demand for bitcoin, unless every miner stops mining and the network becomes insecure, which is nonsensical because as miners stop mining, it would become more profitable to continue mining. 
Can someone shed some light on why there is this concept of block halving rather than a more continuous function that would get us to the same result, albeit more smoothly?

No, but if your business model is to provide L2 solutions to users and businesses; wouldn't it be great to make sure that on-chain transactions are expensive. Your L2 solutions would then be a lot easier to sell.

No. But Blockstream's desire to control and monetize (through liquid and lightning network) BTC means they have no intention of scaling on chain and for ideological reasons they probably wouldn't either.
Also, shilling going pretty strongly in this thread, yikes.

Bitcoin only dies if people stop using it. The price has little to do with how alive it is. If anything this last year the decrease in price is only indicative of the slowdown in adoption vs. predictable inflation from new blocks being mined. It's simply supply and demand. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:09:25
The only flaws are within the platform supporting bitcoin trade (such as exchanges), not bitcoin itself (the blockchain).
Basically, in a video game, if someone hacks your account by guessing your password, or getting a keylogger on your machine, they can steal your items. Then you tell the admins, and if they're competent they ban the hacker and give you your stuff back.
In the bitcoin world, you let someone access your wallet, exchange account, etc. and you're done. You've lost it all, and you can't get it back, because there is nobody with the power to "undo" a transaction (aside from a 51% attack, but even that is only speculation)
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:38:21
I am not by any stretch a bitcoin expert, but it seems they do not understand the POINT of mining.
To my understanding, instead of having a centralized system to verify transactions (such as a bank's servers or google wallet datacenter(s)), every user who is mining is contributing to the processing power needed to encrypt/decrypt (hashes? I don't really know) and confirming these transactions. So instead of having google-esque data centers handling all the load, every user can act as a node and be remunerated for their CPU/GPU cycles by getting bitcoins for every block.
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like forbes is bashing that other article for the wrong reasons. Even if the global power usage of bitcoin mining was significant, it replaces a centralized system that could arguably drain more power.
Would a centralized system draw more or less power? Would it be greener? I know by analogy (I don't know if it's a good one or not) torrents are the most efficient way to share information as every user helps propagate that information down the network.

Right, I totally agree. The issue is that the entirety of your fiat money in your banking account is accessible online, through cryptography. Even if yours specifically isn't, most people's money is accessible online.
Honestly if that came to pass, the internet itself would collapse and we would be back in the 1900s and currency would have to be actual cash (which would also plummet in value) or resources like gold, silver, platinum, etc.
So you're right, but my point was that in the large scheme of things, quantum computing's effect on bitcoin wouldn't be noticed at all in the chaos.
Quantum computing is super exciting, but also super scary to think about.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:03:19
How would this influence bitcoin? More mining power doesn't increase the number of bitcoins mined. We know for a fact that the new bitcoins are predictable in volume over the next 100 years.
If quantum computing came into play, it would simply unbalance how the hashing power is distributed if only a few key players have access to it.
Another thing is that if quantum computing becomes feasible, it'll also annihilate any and all encryption and thus destroy the global economy.
Basically, if Quantum computing becomes a reality tomorrow, bitcoin will be the least of anyone's worries.

There are a lot of things that are un-hackable. HTTPS for example; it's somewhat safe to say that a large portion of the economy of today is fully reliant on modern encryption. AFAIK, what makes encryption possible at all is that there are mathematical operations that are easy to do, but very hard (see, impossible) to backtrack. My understanding of it is that it's much easier to bake a cake than to unbake it to get the original ingredients. The only known possible vulnerability to this would be quantum computers that would be able to trivially solve currently difficult (see, impossible) encryption calculations.
