Wow, ok, I'm not reading all of this idiotic shit.
I mean, just look at this




Seriously? How is someone that dumb?
Look, I'm assuming you were trying to make some boring-ass point about statism. socialism isn't necessarily statist. you people just reeeally need to stop acting like you know shit about things you've never actually studied. it makes you look even less credible somehow. a bit ironic since I'm not reading that shitmess of a thread, but seriously. If that's what you were getting at, just don't.

It really seems like nobody in this sub knows what socialism actually is. For that matter, a lot of people here have some seriously weird ideas about how capitalism operates.
I feel like you guys are the absolute last people who should be trying to inform people about alternative currencies.

I'll sit around and daydream all day while you're my workbitch! See, I'm an *ideas* guy. That means I'm allowed to be a useless piece of shit!

No, you apparently don't. Seriously, flipping through a History Channel docu on the dumbass bolsheviks doesn't exactly give you an understanding of the breadth of socialist movements. 
Please, if you're thoroughly uneducated on a topic, just don't. it's so tedious dealing with people who talk out of their asses about shit they've clearly never actually studied.

I don't think you know how capitalism actually works.
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:53:58
And how is that, exactly?
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:27:50

He's not actually a socialist. He's just *barely* a social democrat. By international standards he's not really that far left at all. Talk to any socialist and they'll say the same.

Jesus, you people are completely insane. Neither Paul nor Sanders are significantly better than Hillary or Bush. They're honestly not that far apart, ideologically.

Not backing up what he said (socialism is a very diverse ideology that isn't necessarily authoritarian, but whatever), but you're one of those special ed superstars who points out the Nazis were the national socialist party, aren't you?
