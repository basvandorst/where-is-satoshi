Cashed out at 16k, friend laughed at me when it hit 18k. Now I'm laughing at him. Cya Bitcoin!

Not to mention the only uses for it today are illegal sports books and drug markets. You can't market Bitcoin commercially with the block fees atm. Cc Processors don't even charge 15% per transaction so you'll never convince businesses to adapt to btc just to lose money.

So basically bitcoin had its most profitable event ever, and will be nearly impossible to duplicate it? Yeah agree, overbought is a good word for it, I think the average Joe was just duped. I don't think they will be stupid enough to buy that heavily ever again. There is less bullshit to peddle this time than before, they won't be so easily convinced. Without convincing a million idiots to invest, this coin is dead.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:11:48
Pump and dump buddy. Its called a pump and dump. Exchanges make billions, average joe loses it all. Welcome to the real world. If bitcoin was regulated like the stock market, we'd be throwing exchange owners in Prison, except its not. So its ripe for scumbags and idiots.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:15:28
Even if it was 10% how are you going to convince them that bitcoin is valuable? An invisible coin you are suppose to hold until the value increases? A coin that as the value increases, makes it even harder to spend since you get charged insane amounts to spend your own money. Any new possible bitcoin investor will look at the current track record and run for the hills if they are smart. Goodluck duping a bunch of idiots into buying coins again, and the exchanges know this. They made their billions, and are happy letting it die from here. They've known the true value of the coin and expected it to go to the mean again.

I'm self made dude, Presidents don't decide my fate or how successful I am in life. I succeeded under Obama, I've continued succeeding under Trump. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:45:23
The bubbles in 2013 aren't even relevant. If you think a 19k to 3k crash is the same as 2013 i don't know why we are even talking. Have a good one.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:56:24
My issue is, in an unregulated market that type of volatility isn't going to convince people to invest. Even if bitcoin rises, it won't be nearly as rapid of a rise. Bitcoin could sit at 4k for the next 10 years, where you eat your losses, or you pull out and invest it into something else. Bitcoin needs some serious adaptation, wouldn't it be smarter to pull out now and buy later? Nothing is going to shoot bitcoin up rapidly overnight, not in todays market. Even after diversifying, I wouldn't keep my funds invested into something that possibly has no recovery, I don't live forever.
Its alot easier to FOMO when bitcoin is $500, rather than 4k. Average person saw bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme, when it busted majority of its investors it lost that hype. Whats going to bring them back again, are people truly stupid enough to invest at 18k again? We don't know, its all speculation but I have my doubts.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:32:18
Trump supporters have negative views of bitcoin as well, don't be so close minded. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:20:10
Guess we'll see, might be able to buy a whole coin for $500 again soon. BOL to you, hope you don't lose to much money in the end. Maybe your right and im wrong, but speculation is a gamble.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:48:27
Lol, I've been into crypto currencies since before the FBI seized Liberty Reserve. I remember trading paypal for bitcoin when it was $6. You don't always know who your talking to on here, maybe you should take advice every now and then. Bitcoin was cool at first, anyone investing today missed the boat and is trying to reach for a pipe dream they missed. I'm not 19, I'm far older, I'm just hip with the lingo. Run for the hills, anyone still buying is crazy. There is nothing that will raise the value of bitcoin, nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:53:33
Nope, I'm just pro America. I support any President in office, I want our country to succeed. Everything in life isn't a partisan debate, bitcoin is bought  by idiots on both sides of the political spectrum.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:18:24
Oh so you provided me a link of someone being arrested for manipulating a regulated market? Thanks for proving my point. There is nothing put in place like this for bitcoin, yet exchanges basically run the entire bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:50:28
Why would it matter the age? You are investing your money into a pump and dump scheme but I'm the ageless wonder? You are a literal idiot by every sense of the word. Enjoy being manipulated by unregulated bitcoin exchanges. Not a very smart way to invest your money. Bitcoin is worthless unless you can convince the average joe its worth investing in. Everyone hodling coins is just killing it further congrats.
Edit: Lol read your post history. You just recently invested in bitcoin for the first time. Praying for a miracle buddy? LOL should have just put your money on black. Take the advice from the majority on here who got out before losing money, and fucking run for the hills.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:05:21
Or you'll end up like 99% of the other stories, broke as fuck and wrong at the end. This isn't a big short scenario bro, you are gambling on an invisible coin that is not backed by the government at ALL.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:12:19
Thanks captain obvious but people who invested little and got Big Bang for their buck can talk about HODLinf all they want. The people who bought coins at 9k - 18k are the ones selling and making the coins plummet back down to reality. This shit should never have been the price it is anyhow. It was pumped up by lies and exchanged coordinating to defraud idiots.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:49:57
I'm talking about the people who thought they could get rich quick and invested money they couldn't afford to lose. There is tons of those out there, he'll I've seen multiple posts today from people who bought in late and stupidly. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:36:00
I laugh when kids compared a 1200$ drop to 200$ as anything near relevant to a 10k drop. But my percentages! Idiots, sell this shit it'll never reach 19k again people have realized the pump and dump scam and are dumping. This is what happens with unregulated exchanges collude together to pump up crypto, they get rich and suckers lose it all. Best of luck to anyone who was gullible enough to buy a coin at 18k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:14:07
Thank you, people think investing 1k and having a coin drop 10k is relevant to someone investing 19k and having it drop to 10k. Not even slightly the same. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:18:30
Idk maybe I've been invested for to long but as soon as I saw it hit 10k I knew lots of people were going to lose money. Anyone who thought with modern mining fees that Bitcoin could maintain that ROI is gambling with fire.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:07:00
Think long and hard. What is going to make Bitcoin 30k? Supply and demand? Demand for what? A currency that you can't spend without eating insane fees or waiting hours. A currency so flexible that businesses won't dare receive funds in it for fear of losses due to variables. What is going to make it worth 30k? Convince me to rebuy in! If you can't, goodluck convincing anyone normal to buy into something that's tanking like the titanic. You can't just hold it all day and expect it to be valuable, there has to be signs of improvement to make it worth investing in.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:04:04
Bro people aren't trolling, we are trying to say open your eyes bitcoin is a fucking scam. Bitcoin exchanges pumped and dumped the coin for insane profits. They made enough money to allow the coin to die, and it will. Bitcoin has NOTHING to make it more valuable except perceived value. No one values bitcoin bro, its fucking worthless now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:55:27
I'm glad your sarcastic but there is believe it or not, people who actually invested 18k for one Bitcoin. People that saw the block transaction delays and people dropping Bitcoin in droves and actually thought it was the time to invest. It's satire to you but someone out there is feeling like killing themselves over this, and I really hope they are alright. Pump and dump schemes are as old as the Internet. Somehow idiots still fall for them.
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:33:19
Good question when your making a small amount of money, but the pump and dump didn't just affect bitcoin. It affected nearly every traded crypto currency so to put a dollar amount on the scam is nearly impossible. You are talking possibly billions of dollars. Would it be worth the attempt to do it again? Not likely, its like an exit scam but instead of just shutting down. You let the currency run its natural course, you let the true buyer set the perceived value. In which they are, and they are setting it at worthless. 
The scary thing is, if BItcoin does begin adaptation. Lets say we see some major movement towards crypto usage in the US. Where are you going to get your coin from? The same shady ass exchanges as before. Is it worth the risk to gamble your investments on something unregulated. What is going to protect the investors from the same thing not happening again? Hell, it 100% could, do I think it will. No, I think bitcoin hits 2k, sits at 2k for awhile, then eventually 1k, then back to a few hundred bucks value based on whatever the tor drug market values the coin since all the legit investors will be long gone.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:51
Majority of people in here are parading around .1 and talking about HODLing. Anyone with actual skin in the game isn't sitting around after a 10k crash. The exchanges colluded to pump up Bitcoin. It's what happens when you have a trade market that is unregulated and ripe for fraud. Exchanges make billions, suckers lose it all. That's how the cruel world works. Anyone who thinks any of those past "dips" are even comparable are retarded. You could add all those together and they wouldn't equal today's "dip". People are losing faith in Bitcoin and it's shown to be unreliable to anyone trying to actually purchase items with it. It's basically worthless to anyone who isn't HODLing (which in itself makes the coin less valuable).
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:30:35
Bitcoin is gambling. Look at everyone who bought in way over their head. House is getting rich while the average person keeps buying back hoping to get an edge.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:12
Lol noobs that cashed out and ddint eat 8k in losses. Yeah I'll take that badge of honor. I'll rebuy in at 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:12:05
Lmao. With those transaction fees you won't be decimating shit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:29
lol 19k to 8750. Oh its just a dip. Thats a fucking landslide. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:02:09
I've been convincing all my friends to cash out for months. They were all stupid like you and ate the losses. Goodluck recovering from this when Bitcoin has literally nothing else to make it more valuable. You people are gonna HODL till it's worthless.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:13:57
Cool. Show me people who invested largely in the previous 2013 dips. I find it hard to believe with how fast Bitcoin rose this past year that the majority of investors were early buyers. The past year had huge influx of sucker investors which pumped up the price. Now it's time to rinse and repeat hopefully for you all who invested late, if not you are in for a rude awakening. With the amount of large dollar late term investors this dip is a killer to their portfolio since no one invested 100k in Bitcoin after Mt Gox. So they aren't comparable.
