ETH is more capable now and further along in the development for scaling (Casper update set for early 2018 = PoS and sharding)

That’s not true. It’s quite valid technical solutions exist but developers refusing to move beyond ideological boundaries condemn it. 
Proof of Stake is something that every coin should be aiming for (unless they’re serving the interests of the miners). Yet the Core devs would never consider a change so radically different from their fundamental views of how things should be.

There's 3 CME circuit breakers.  7%, 13% and 20% moves from prior settlement date of the fixing price (determined daily with VWAP from 3:59-4pm london)
7% is soft limit, if lead month hits it then trading continues for 2 minutes under a restricted period (cannot trade beyond the 7% during these 2 minutes).  If it's still at the limit at the end of the 2 minute monitoring period, there will be a 2 minute trading halt.
After the 2 minute halt (or no halt if its below the limit at the end of the first 2 minute monitoring period), trading will resume with the new circuit breaker of 13%.
The 13% is a soft limit as well and mechanism is exact same as 7% first limit.
Once breaching the second circuit breaker (and after the monitoring period and any respective trading halts), trading resumes with the 20% hard limit.
20% hard limit breach results in trading halt on any trades beyond the limit for the remainder of the session.  Trading can continue/resume within the 20% limit during this time though

Since when is $10k “a lot” of money?  Pretty much anyone out of college with a full time job should have no issues with that kind of savings.

That’s exactly the point though. Consensus could very easily form that instead of a hard fork, another existing crypto already services the problem so why would the consensus remain with a fork to a new dev team to begin progress on the chain as opposed to simply moving adoption to an existing chain that’s already developed the solutions. 
The only reason is fundamental ideology. There are tons of coins with more cooperative development teams (ETH for example) and better technological solutions than Bitcoin right now. But the reason Bitcoin has remained dominant is because a large part of the “consensus” is ideologically driven as opposed to objectively driven.

Isn’t that exactly what QASH is doing with their Worldbook exchange?

That’s literally called hindsight bias and one of the major fallacies in portfolio allocation decision making. 


I’m willing to bet my whole book that there’s assets with better risk adjusted returns. 
Portfolio performance is determined by two metrics, alpha and sigma.

And why’s that?  They just announced their custodial ringfenced product. How are you judging their custody solutions which haven’t even launched yet?

The absolute level of an index isn’t what’s used by analysts to determine valuations in the equity markets. You look at multiples and yield.

Custody =! Exchange wallet

lol students.  The real world is very aware.  Come to any bulge bracket bank and you'll get 3/4 people aware of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is more well understood across the trading floor than the product of the equity derivatives desk I trade on.

This is mirroring with AAPL all over again.
