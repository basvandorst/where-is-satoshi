Very easy. For most asic miners.
You go on router and look up device address. 
Then you enter address in a web page, that will direct you to the device interface.
You can YouTube how to setup an antminer. 
You can Google "nicehash profitability calculator".
Then that will show, you almost all GPU, CPU, ASIC miners. 
If you click custom settings you can change the values.
For a bitmain S9 $25.62 Canadian per day.
If I go to custom and remove the wattage I have $28.71 CAD.
So it's about 3.09 CAD per day in hydro at .1 cents per kWh.
You can also look at whattomine.com
And enter your own in GPU and ASIC tab.
Hope this helps!! 
Happy mining ��

I had it planned out.
42-45 days it goes from lowest to highest. 
14days from highest point to get to lowest. 
And another 42-45 days to reach max.
November 2nd was supposed to be the turning point of the drop
Bitcoin cash fucked it up.
I bought more about 4hrs ago. And I'm up $60 so not to bad.
Just need to wait 3 months so I can make a new chart.

Yes so it be 3.09 CAD per day to run.
The S9 is around 75 decibels.
There is a video here that will show you how loud it is. 
Also there are many ways to lower the sound by making a box.

It is tax able only when you take out to cash.
If you remove .001 bitcoin you have to claim the actual cash value at the time of cashing out. 
The way the canadian government put it is, Debra is a babysitter and was watching John's kids. John had no money. John gave Debra 3 dozen eggs that where valued at $10 .
Debra can't claim eggs, but the value exchanged is $10. So Debra must pay tax on $10. 
There using this law for Bitcoin. So technically even if you don't cash out you still have to claim. But seeing how they don't know your address they can't tell. 
I would only claim cash.
