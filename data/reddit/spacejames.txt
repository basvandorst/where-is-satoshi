Play it in reverse and it's ripple today.

I bought one at 3k after the whole China thing but put it all into alt coins, and while their value has definitely increased I would have bene much better off keeping it as btc.

It will probably hit 25 k by the end of the day.

that feel when you bought bitcoin but converted it all to alts. Still have a decent return, nothing like this though.

Looking deeper into this, a day before this occurred I got an email from Poloniex support stating 
"Dear customer,
For security reasons we will disable withdrawals for all accounts without Google Sign-In.
Please click here to integrate your account with Google Sign-In.
Kind regards,
Poloniex Support."
The email address I recieved this from is "exchange.poloniex
which is clearly a fake poloniex email.

The click here leads to this 
Looks like there's a poloniex scam going around.

I'm glad I didn't keep all my monero and btc in exchanges but it's still a pretty shit situation. Good tip about using a separate email address for exchanges, I already did this but if I didn't then I could probably have risked my actual banking information being compromised.

Blockchain.info show that the wallet that recieved my stolen funds has only had 1 transaction processed. This is the unauthorized withdrawal from my Bittrex account.
Is there anything at all I can do?
