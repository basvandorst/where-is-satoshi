If you look at history, gold is at a speculative high today.   A 300 year history of gold shows an inflation adjusted average of $500/oz.   


That is a false statement.   Value is relative and markets can stay irrational longer than you stay solvent.   The gold's value is determined when you need to exchange it.   If you need to exchange it during a low value timeframe, it's value has decreased- not stayed the same.


I already proved this false.  Gold has even recently experienced drops greater than inflation.  


Very long term gold must go down because population growth will flatten and decline.   Even sooner will be asteroid mining which will flood the market.  
I'm not selling my gold and plan to buy some more.  But don't kid yourself thinking you can predict the market.   History says gold should be $500 / oz which makes the current price a speculative bubble.

It did drop in value even factoring inflation and therefore it can again.   Absolutely everything you claim are the same claims people made in the 1970's about gold.  It all sounds rational which is why I bought gold in the early 1980's.  Then it went down year after year for 20 years.  It lost value greater than the inflation rate.  For example if you bought gold at the start of 1980 for $600, it was only worth $400 in 1981 despite inflation only being 13.5%.
If you buy 1oz gold today for $1300 and in 20 years can only sell it for $1000, it has lost real value.   (And that 1oz would buy even less than $1000 worth of goods in 2038 because of inflation.)

You need to start googling before making provably false statements.   The ratio of gold to oil has historically been all over the place from over 30 barrels per ounce to under 3 barrels per oz.  
Look at the graph on this page, it's not even smooth trend but looks like a seismograph.   You can make an average out of the graph but the variance is so high you can't make any predictions from year to year.

If you buy a $1 coin and in the future can only buy $0.10 amount of goods, it is no longer a $1 coin.   I personally experienced this by buying gold in the 80's and then watched as it went down to 1/4th of what I paid for it over the next 20 years.   
It's no different than a paper dollar not being able to buy as much.   You still have that physical $1 paper bill but it can't buy as much as it did 20 years ago.


You specifically mentioned gold holding it's value long ago when it didn't.   It is more stable today but could still drop to 1/6th of it's current value as it did from it's peak in 1980 to it's low in 2000.   
In the very long term, gold is likely to go down in value because it is believed that global population will stabilize and then decrease once all third world countries have increased their standard of living like in Japan and Europe.

Gold's value fluctuated wildly before modern transportation.   The reason is that regional crop failures couldn't be instantly moderated by diesel ships, trains, and trucks.   This meant that your 1 oz gold that would have bought a year of food was devalued to a weeks worth of food or less.

That is beside the point that I proved your statement about gold's value to be false.   If you sell gold at low that is it's value.   History says it should be $500.  You believe hyperinflation is around the corner.  That's fine.  Until it happens gold is over priced from it's historical price.
