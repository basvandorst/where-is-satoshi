Have you heard of safe deposit boxes at a bank?

It's really very interesting to see the major financial publications start to show a serious and non-negative (or mixed anyway) point of view on BTC. 
Neat.  For my part, I've been asking small businesses where I live if they have considered accepting Bitcoin.  It's a fun conversation starter.

Well, offline storage ensures long term issues around backups and system security can be moderated and the risk reduced. And I believe there are places other than banks where you can get a safe deposit box. 
The point is, being able to store them in places where they will be protected from unauthorized access, as well as environmental hazards, such as fire or water damage.
Additionally, I might make multiple copies of each paper wallet and place them in a variety of locations to protect against physical loss or damage.
I don't believe that Bitcoin will get rid banks and other institutions of finance. Rather, I think they will transform into other kinds of things and people will see more diversity in the  kinds of institutions for financial services. 
YMMV.

What I'd do in this kind of situation is that I'd set up paper wallets to keep 99% of the coins offline. I'd keep not more than 10BTC per wallet or not more than 50 wallets. I would keep them at banks or other locations that offered secure storage of small objects. And I'd not mention it to ANYONE.

This thread is the first time I've heard of dogecoin. Huh. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:03:23
Yeah. My question usually starts: do you accept Bitcoin? And we go from there.

Hahaha.

Bitcoin. /pedantic. Sorry.

If we don't spend them, then they have no value at all. Everyone holding onto Bitcoin as a financial instrument is a ridiculous game. It's the kind of game where we will see them rise in value and rise in value and then collapse to nothing. 
So that means spending them. 
Or accepting them for services, as I am going to do with my photography.
