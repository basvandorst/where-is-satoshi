Food isn't primarily produced and maintained by 'fans of food', not really sure where you are expecting this analogy to go.
File-**sharing** communities are strictly non-capitalistic because financial shortages are the main reason people get into them, but also because financial incentives aren't enough to even get movie companies/record labels to maintain all of their content over time - establishing an altruistic community works a lot better

Well he admitted to founding the site, and his claim is that he handed it off and then it was handed back to him shortly before the bust
assuming Ulbricht's story is correct (I dont believe it, but i'll entertain it)
narcotics trafficking &lt;- this is going to stick
computer hacking &lt;- this he might get out of
money laundering&lt;- this is going to stick, as it is/was a function of the operation of the service
engaging in a criminal enterprise &lt;- this will stick because he was a part-time admin at least
conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent IDs &lt;- this sticks anyways, he got busted with these months before the FBI arrested him for SR
and it 'might' help in making the murder-for-hire charges in his Maryland case get dropped (as other DPR/Karpeles would be the one quilty of those)
