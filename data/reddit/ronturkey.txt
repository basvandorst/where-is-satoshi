I agree with his agenda. There are lots of things that I disagree with. I hate his exaggerations, I hate his half truths, I hate his need to be the center of attention. I pick apart the same things about past presidents. Jesus, nobody is going to be the perfect president for ALL of the people. Agree to disagree, all good, mate!

Hardly. I think he's completely wrong AF in this scenario, but I still support most of his agenda.

That's pretty fucked up? Are you ok?
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:19:03
I'm doing just fine. Give me something much worse than that.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:01:25
Everyone starts off as "the best of the best". If the CEO/owner/king/leader is not happy with the performance, then it becomes a 180 degree flip. I've seen it happen hundreds of times across multiple businesses. You think you are getting the best, but in reality, maybe they are weak and incompetent compared to their stellar track records.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:31:16
Negative. I support Trump. Just like anyone with half a brain, you stick to your principles and moral code, no matter what one person says. Trump is definitely wrong in this situation. I'm sure there are other things that I disagree with him on as well, but that doesn't mean I bash him.
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:21:47
Actually no.. it allows more manipulation than is already present in this space. With that being said, I'm accumulating, so I could give two shits less what the price does in the next few years.

I believe the 6500 to 3k was the capitulation phase.
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:17:26
Essentially, these are scams unless you manufacture yourself. Don't put it past any company to have one individual to steal your funds.
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:32:52
Yeah, in my world, misleading means fake news.
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:47:30
How many have you seen, in person?
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:11:40
No. Wrong. That is not capitulation. Capitulation is a selloff.
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:34:31
Hard to write? You write an s and a circle. Are you that incompetent or do you have no arms? 
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:23:53
Yes, you should absolutely put in more. Try to out in a little every week or every month. HODL!
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:53:29
I am not a fan of Bitcoin cash, but this smells and feels like fake news!
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:13:03
Imo, it's best to keep some in various places. If there is a back door on a trezor, or a desktop wallet, I sure AF don't want all my coins in one spot. There is definitely merit in an exchange acting as your hot wallet.

It is a scam. It's a scam for the smart and for the wealthy.
@_date: 2019-11-23 07:32:09
Don't forget about your tax liability.
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:11:05
Yes, as long as it's done every year, it keeps the exchanges honest. The crooked ones will go tits up. Additionally, this forces hodlers to learn more on cold storage and security.
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:00:01
What is more important for helping bitcorn? Is mining more important, or is it running a node more important?  On a complete random thought, could i point an old satellite TV dish into the sky to pick up Blockstream's feed? Anyone know of anyone that is doing this?
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:10:28
I've been using sats for about 6 months. It's really easy once you, "get it". With Bitcoin near 10k, it's been extremely easy.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:50:48
Where and how are you storing your keys?
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:29:17
I wish my mom was this cool!
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:40:17
False. Can't make money if you never sell. HODL.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:37:04
How much was your total?
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:25:09
Capitulation from 8k to 35k? That doesn't make any sense disphit. Capitulation is essentially "panic selling". Your example implies that it is "panic buying" which only exists in crypto, and is the complete opposite of capitulation.
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:03:50
Do some research and learn how to store your crypto where it is not at risk, if your exchange gets hacked. Additionally, don't forgot about ethereum and Monero. Bitcoin is currently king, but those are very good projects, as well.
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:05:41
How does that work? I can mine to a pool. I'm not running a node, right?
@_date: 2019-11-14 10:41:44
Fucking do it. I wish I had the balls to do that. You're young and have nothing to lose. Just stay single and never have kids and you will always have plenty of money.

Here is what I'm confused about. There is all this discussion about miners having the ability to Withhold transactions, even indefinitely, but can someone please explain how this actually works. In my world, a miner runs. It's just hashing away. Me, nor any of my miners, have the ability to do a damn thing. Please explain how miners have the ability to do certain things. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:08:27
Can you truly trust your wallet?

Good God. Im not capable of all those shenanigans.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:15:11
Rising prices with decreasing volume. That usually isn't a positive situation. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 08:44:47
Can you elaborate on the process, as I'm unaware of how exactly this takes place? For example: you withdrew 401k or IRA funds to purchase BTC (taking a penalty)? Or, in lieu of contributing to your IRA, you used funds to buy BTC, and then added that as a special investment for your tax guy to deal with?
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:45:49
I think it's Bitcoin wrapped in gold, or some verbiage like that.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:09:04
You ONLY owe taxes when you're too fucking stupid to know what you're talking about.

That's incorrect.

We should already be inside the blue bar that is one year before halving. Why isn't your chart updated for that?
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:10:06
Is it BTC or bch?
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:20:53
Everytime I transfer BTC, it shows up instantly. It might not be confirmed for 5 or 10 minutes, but it shows up right when it sent. Does someone have the % of how many times a transaction is shown instantly, but not verified. For example, if I send 100 transactions, I'm confident they will eventually be verified. What percent will not get verified?
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:02:16
How does a raspberry pi store the entire Blockchain?
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:02:39
It's done. Under 10k was the target.
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:04:38
Correct. I'm not mining Bitcoin directly because I'm not running sha 256. However, I'm paid in bitcoin to mine shit coin. This is a much better on ramp than downloading and setting up other Software.
@_date: 2019-08-20 08:08:59
Good for you buddy. I'm in the same boat. I'll eat peanut butter sandwiches everyday if it means I can buy a little bit of BTC each month.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:20:08
Makes sense. Do you have a link for this build. I think it would be a fun and cheap thing to put together.
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:08:10
Well my build is actually for CPU mining. My GPUs are just for fun.

@_date: 2019-08-04 14:31:11
Just buy from Coinbase or Cash App. At least you can withdraw and send it wherever the fuck you wanna send it. Once you send it out, don't send it back. If you make a large profit and send back to Coinbase and then cash out at Coinbase, you are on the hook for taxes for those capital gains.
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:23:20
Not really, definitely not everyday unless your looking at hourly or minute charts. I looking at daily or weekly, as it provides better data.
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:22:03
Create a BTC wallet that doesn't require ANY information. Have a friend send you 50 bucks worth and pay your friend in cash. That would leave no trace.

I compare it to using Word but not knowing how a computer works. There is not much of an incentive for me to run a node or try to understand how it works (initially). There is a pretty clear incentive to run some miners. With all that being said, I'm a weird person, so it's quite likely weird that I don't understand the intracacies of running a node. I haven't been down that rabbit hole yet. Still trying to figure it out

BTC was like 12k when I used BTC to buy it. I can resell it at near the same dollar amount as I bought it because it's still a profitable machine as it's fairly new.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:08:14
Tether up is converting your BTC into Tether USDT, which is reducing all risk in the short term. Basically, going cash, and waiting for a big drop to rebuy.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:20:40
And they require actual cash in your account, so you can't buy Bitcoin on credit and go into massive debt!

Does anyone run a casa node? Is the $300 annual subscription worth it? I don't have an issue with buying a plug and play casa node, but I think the annual subscription is kind of bullshit.

Nothing is safe, including dollars. They lose value every year via inflation, and the FED continues to print billions, making your precious dollars less and less valuable every year. Buttcorn is not safe, but it has properties that would appear to make it more safe than dollars, in the long term.

What miners are you using?
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:35:56
Update it.

Or it just means that more powerful machines have hit the market, and the price is at a nice equilibrium where miners can turn a tiny profit.

This becomes a scenario where the ASIC manufacturers take a fucking lesson from a manufacturer like Baikal. Baikal has miners that are 2-3 years old and are still profitable. Bitmain needs to be producing machines that are low power consumers. They need their electricity hogs like the s9 and s17, but also the 300 or 400 watt machines that can be used in home without major heat and noise.

ASICs are like having hundreds of GPUs. I can still solo mine, buts it would be pointless. So you think mining is what considers you an early adopter?
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:14:16
Yes they will. they simply need a third party than can immediately convert it to cash. This is becoming common and solves the problem of price volatility and potential risk.

Uh. Stay poor and maybe you won't get hacked.
