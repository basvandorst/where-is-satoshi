Seriously, you don't need KYC, Wiki. I'm glad to know this option exists but I still won't be using it with that caveat in place.

That doesn't make any sense. Coinbase not implementing SegWit hurts BTC, thus making Ver happy.

By what exactly? Miners were the ones who wanted to increase blocksize with 2x.

If this sub could muster a meaningful portion of "important stuff" it would make that other sub seem truly illegitimate. However with the tremendous influx of new hodlers, memes serve as a unifying rally cry. It's not going away until a crash (if it crashes) forces out the weak hands.

Yea! Off-chain scaling offered/controlled by centralized institutions! Perfect. FFS.

That propaganda exploited a weakness/deficiency. It offered a 'solution' to a problem, even if it was a problem they themselves help create. If the fees/TX times were low it would have no effect.

Internet is the defacto method for crypto, to suggest viable alternatives exist is silly . **IPSs know where you packets are going** if they want to promote or block certain exchanges they will. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:19:41
Aaah, my misunderstanding; good distinction. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:04:37
Let's be more honest: BTC's inability to provide an adequate scaling solution **now** is what jeopardizes mass adoption. The only reason BCH wasn't DOA was due to BTC's higher fees and slower confirmation times.
As others have said, attacks will never cease, you can only fight them off by offering a better product *when users want it*. BTC needs to deliver a product people want to use, not concern themselves with petty shit-slinging or elimination of competitors.

Implanted chips (RFID style) that sync with an app/scanner and requires fingerprint/optical/password/pin to access.

The revocation of net neutrality most certainly has a possible side effect on bitcoin. With ISPs having the ability to prioritize and selectively block traffic, they will see that the packets you're sending are going to an exchange, and they will block this traffic. Instead, they will ~~force~~ allow to you to use ComcastCoin or AT&amp;TExchange. Alternatively they'll require extra monthly fees to access your existing exchanges. 
And to all the people thinking "Oh this is an American thing it won't harm me", exactly how many nodes and exchanges are based in the United States? If all of them are suddenly blacklisted by ISPs and not allowed to interact with the rest of the world, don't you think that will  diminish the decentralisation of cryptocurrencies?

Make no mistake, without NN we're straight fucked no matter what.

There are always actors seeking fortunes who will confuse and manipulate to achieve their goal. There will always be hodlers who fight vehemently for which ever bag they hold. The only safe bet is to not invest more than you are comfortable losing, and sit the fence by diversifying your holdings, biased towards whichever coin you believe has the greatest potential. 
Edit: fuck it, if point A has been met (no more invested than comfortable losing) by all means go all in with whichever strikes your fancy- it's all a gamble at this point and you might as well swing for the fences.

Which of these upcoming 5g networks won't be owned by those same monopolies?

Your reply is entirely dismissive of the actual issue- new adopters who are looking for a usable commodity will not find it in BTC's current form. BTC's brand recognition is its saving grace in that regard. Clearly development takes time. My point is if mass adoption is eminent, BTC needs to provide a solution to meet this or they risk losing momentum to alts. By saying 'it takes time' and 'we're still beating it' doesn't address OP's point: jeopordation of mass adoption. You're selling a car with no tires and promising that it'll be worth it once they're delivered. People who want a usable commodity don't care about 'someday'. Provide it now or they'll find something else that will.

Nicehash has a minimum amount to pay to external wallets, 0.01 BTC I think, paid weekly. Until you reach that balance nothing will be transferred to your Luno wallet.

Not banned, just force users to upgrade to a "business use" package for an additional $xx/month fee.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:28:32
What's their incentive? That should be obvious, more cash. Promote Verizicoin (coming soon!) or whichever exchange pays them and strangle out the competition.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:00:51
I'm 100% with you- no jeopardizing the system for 'quick fix'. My possibly obstructed point was devs need to concern themselves with creating the solution rather than remaining caught up in the bickering and drama of 'negating competitors'. Providing that strong product is what will deflate competition.

Because there are use cases outside of day trading and speculation.

As a newbie to crypto, I'm stashing all my BTC in cold storage and heading down to the pub for a pint &amp; wait for this all to blow over. Any other move I make is bound to be stupid.
