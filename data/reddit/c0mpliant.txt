Central banks have differing powers and remits but one thing that's pretty universal is they have significant influence to get legislation passed related to financial matters.
Also, depending on the remit of the central bank they could make certain things illegal if it's already within the powers set out in its legislative basis.

Sorry but bitcoin is still only worth what people are willing to pay for it. You have no idea what the situation will be, a year, two years or twenty years from now.
Bitcoin is very similar to fiat currency in that regard. Its not backed by anything, it can't be used for anything else if no one thinks it has value. Gold for example, even if people don't see it as valuable for being worn as a display of wealth still has use in scientific and industrial processes.
The fluctuations in the value of bitcoin underlines this fact that you're only exchanging one form of fiat currency for another.
I'm not saying bitcoin isn't useful at the moment and it isn't worth what it is today but it's no more a safe bet than any other fiat currency. In fact, its probably a less safe bet than holding any kind of fiat currency due to the very fluctuations in perceived value that people are celebrating today.

This is the critical thing so many people on the sub seem to forget. It's supply and demand, not supply. The supply is fixed but the demand could change at any time depending on a wide range of circumstances. The real question people are asking about when they're talking about what will the value of bitcoin do, is what is the demand for bitcoin right now.
