I really wonder how much liquidity really exists at the price points.  I don't think it would take a very big sell order to move the market down at this point in time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:46
Not bullish.  At all.  It's telling US banks that they'll be seen as market participants if they extend credit for purchases of cryptos, that they need to treat them like cash--which means Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer compliance, and that people releasing coins are being warned they could be required to comply with existing SEC regulations regarding those releases.

Whatever cartel of folks was orchestrating this scam are starting to really lose control of it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:21:27


Um, no.  There was actually a much more straightforward use case for tulip bulbs than Bitcoin--you can plant them and they make pretty flowers.  Which is why they are still worth something today.
History is full of bubbles.  The South Sea Company.  Matchsticks (seriously).  The list goes on.

If you're going to sell at 5K then sell now while there is still some liquidity.

“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.” “The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.” “The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master – – that's all.”

Yep.  Reminds me of the housing bubble...watching that finally collapse was very interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:22
Laugh.  Bitcoin isn't EVEN a currency.  It is scam, a Ponzi scheme.  And it is going to zero.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:37:12
There's a reason why you don't hear this from the shills and pumpers--because when the value case is stated that explicitly the ridiculousness of it becomes apparent.
For example, what would prompt a massive transfer of wealth from the huge, distributed number of holders of sovereign currency to the tiny number of shadowy entities who hold most of the Bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:49:52
I was trying to do the same among some lunatics who thought passing money through Bitcoin would be a great way to generate extra spend on credit cards for miles and points.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:32:19
Yeah, the psychology now is people desperately trying to "make back" what they've lost.  Full capitulation soon.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:23:54
India?  The Indian government would never, ever allow external control of its sovereign currency.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:19:44
Please.  You moved from a "network effect" to "Facebook!" to try and make the case Bitcoin has value.  Facebook has value because it is a firm that generates revenue.  You know, shares of a company.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:47:51
I started to get interested in this when that piece came out showing just how incredibly concentrated Bitcoin ownership is.  Small enough that a cartel could control the supply of Bitcoin into the public market and vary that amount to move the price at will.  My guess is that what we are really seeing now is the collapse of that cartel arrangement and an every-man-for-himself race to the bottom as the rest of their holdings try to get liquidated.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:35:02
Fascinating.  So the underlying market is small enough that selling 65M USD/13,000 bitcoins worth would drop the value to $2000/Bitcoin,
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:22:14
Anyone who ever believed that the entire economic structure of the world would allow a handful of anonymous and shadowy hackers to generate a giant portion of a fixed token system and have that become the world's money supply is a blithering idiot.  Beyond all of the other issues with Bitcoin in particular and cryptos in general.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:41
It's nominal because it was generated due to a very, very small proportion of the underlying money supply circulating and then using that imputed value across the non-circulating part of the money supply.  Bitcoins were never "worth" 20K. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:53:06
Nonsense.  Bretton Woods finally, finally killed the specie standard for backing currency--and it took 30 years to do so.  Now you all think it is a "revolution" to go back to a currency system that is like the gold standard but even worse?
Why the fuck should the US, for example, want a bunch of Chinese Bitcoin miners to determine the money supply?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:04
Or even that many of us are old enough to have lived through the last bubble and saw this coming a mile away.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:14:40
Laugh.  I was once stuck in a little village in Namibia with Euros and USD and trying to get a bit of gas for my truck was near impossible.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:05
The "fundamental value" of a currency is related to the economic activity--i.e., the value of the firms--of the sovereign state that issued that currency.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:54:02
Um, you think that is positive?
Read the SEC testimony Page 5, esp. Footnote 11.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:25:13
They're seeing the happy wrapper and not paying attention to the meat of the testimony.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:54:11
What countries, specifically, do you think are going to see their sovereign currencies replaced by Bitcoin (or any other crypto)?  Actually, what countries are actually facing hyperinflation today?  Venezuela?  Ok, who else?  And are you seriously positing that Bitcoin will make its holders wealthy when the Venezuelas and Zimbabwes of the world blow their economies up?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:32:29
And thanks for a great example of the gobbledygook I am talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:48:26
Back in the dot-com crash we said that chart is the big "Fuck You" finger!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:08:18
Yep.  Once people begin to doubt there is a bigger fool the mania begins to subside.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:35:22


Tell me you don't really believe this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:58:05
That is a damn amusing list.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:13:17


You don't understand what "fundamentals" are.  Here's the "fundamentals" about Bitcoin:
It has zero intrinsic value.  There is no "fundamental" value to Bitcoin.  There are no earnings.  There is no profit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:45
Falling knives aren't at bottoms.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:50:07
Yep, the notion blockchain is more significant than Bretton Woods, just as one example, shows a shocking lack of knowledge about economic history.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:39:44


A lot more than that!  Shit, Global Crossing alone blew billions.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:19:05
Read that article.  See all the use cases that were proposed for the Internet back then.  
Cryptos?  The only possible use case is as a medium of exchange and they're even worse than the gold standard which takes some real doing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:35:12
What do you think the value of a real currency is derived from?  Gnomes in the caves in Zurich?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:41:32
Right but that doesn't have anything to do with a fundamental valuation of the currency involved.
Now, is there potential value in a FIRM that trades Bitcoin?  Sure.  But if Bitcoin itself has no value than that trading platform also has no value.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:13:24


What a tremendous load of crap.
It is a GOOD thing that the USD has seen that decline in value.  An underlying inflation rate of 1-2 percent is important for the functioning of a modern economy.  Deflation is absolutely horrible for an economy.  In a deflationary economy consumption collapses because goods in the future are expected to be less expensive in the future.  Holders of capital sit back and enjoy risk free returns from the deflation and do not have the spur of underlying inflation to invest that capital, starving industrial and technological development.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:55:34
You really don't understand that along with the AML/Credit Card language is a gigantic STOP sign to US banks?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:28:06


That is...simply not true.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:45:36
You're not confused.  It is a quite purposeful mix of technological and governmental utopianism DESIGNED to create an illusion of value.
There isn't even a patent value to the technology that could generate some underlying income stream.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:45:10


No.  The **nominal value** of mined cryptocoins might have been that high.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:09:13
Who?  I'll tell you who--the people squeezing the last bit out of the Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:00:24
SEC testimony, Page 5, Footnote 11.
They've told the banks that funds into and out of exchanges, especially coming from credit sources, have to be handled under Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements.
THAT'S the big deal.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:19:29
In the grand scheme of things it is a cheap lesson.  A lot of people are going to get dinged a lot worse.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:34:31
Think about it this way; does the profits that the bank interchange system generate mean the currencies being exchanged have fundamental value?
