Block size is a non-problem. And because of it the vast majority don't really make drastic changes, which up sets a few people on reddit.

2. How does the fact that I've only lost money in bitcoin invalidate my opinion on bitcoin(as you are implying).

as someone who brought his first bitcoin at 900+, I am not affected by this at all. The problem with bitcoin is we need some of the new innovative apps to come out which probably won't happen before next year so sit tight and enjoy cheap bitcoins for now :)

ok thanks, also its kBits k=kilo=1000 ei 1000  bits where as m=milli=1/1000, so mBits would be nano BTCs.

I don't understand, why would I get downvoted?
Also mBTC is kbits.

Don't worry bitcoin currently is probably only worth, about 200$. In order for it to have legitimate growth however we need speculators and the likes to try see how much the coins are actually worth and to excite new people who still haven't tried it. Furthermore, It also won't be before the US fed announces QE5 that people truly realize just how dire the situation is. When that happens bitcoin is going to see alot of legitimate growth.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:13:23
Just to make this clear you didn't hurt his business, the reporter did. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:25:48
Errm no, when i say 200$ I mean if the price was purely based on its usage atm and not as its uses as being speculative. Meaning that if no speculation occurred in bitcoins then I think a reasonably price of a bitcoin would be 200$.  
However I do think that the price of bitcoin(not based on its value of speculation) will be significantly higher in the future.
Also I first learned about bitcoins when it was 1200$, I brought some and even though I knew they probably wasn't worth more than 200$(maybe less) back then aswell, I knew that in the future they would be.

Why are we only trying to fix this based on increasing block size?, Shouldn't we look into increasing the number of blocks per 10 min (and lower rewards as well). This would allow a more continuous creation of blocks instead of large discrete blocks.

No.. security is based on the Hashrate of the network, in a 10 min span your block would be just as safe.

I think they will be worth the double(the actual objective worth).
So if we say a bitcoin atm is 1 good monitor then it will be worth 2 good monitors. However the dollar will be worth very little.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:06:28
So when you put 2 and 2 together that means you shouldn't accept my proposal blindly either.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:26:51
First off my point of the post was that no single individual should be the trusted all deciding entity. And I agree Gavin doesn't and shouldn't decide all when it comes to bitcoin but that still doesn't stop him for planning a fork.
 Secondly the security of the blocks would remain the same over a 10 min span.
Thirdly this was my solution I too am an individual my point was rather that we need to all have different solutions and then let the majority decide on which, not just have gavin schedule a planned fork.
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:09:38
Sure there is, but since its over shadowed by the speculation price it is only theoretical.
Here let me give you an example:
Imagine that you have a market of houses, you then have families looking to buy these house and they can afford to pay X. Now lets say your government has inflated the money supply and created a bubble in the house market. Now people will buy the house not based on their value X which the families could afford but rather on the price X*Y, where Y &gt; 1, based on the assumption they'll continue to go up in value. This price is the speculation price, and as we can see the X component which i dubbed "price based on its usage" is still there but only theoretically since it can no longer be separated from the actual price.
Now the reason why this is important is because speculation is only short term, and can often swing both way. Now I may have undershot saying its only worth 200$ but given the way this subreddit reacts to the slightest increase still makes me feel there are people who are only in it for the short term.

No, a more correct way of thinking of it, is there is one set of rules that everyone follows. Those rules determine when someone gets paid with new bitcoin. If someone disobey the rules then they are no longer acknowledged by everyone else. 


He didn't he just described the rules, his actual coding was considered quite bad.


How does anything become popular? word of mouth, public speakers etc.


All servers running a program that adheres the bitcoin rules are official server. As such if you yourself buy a server and install the program then you too have an official server. That doesn't mean you can do anything special though other than helping to maintain the network.


Digital signatures. The same you use when you go login to your bank.
A common misconception is that computers are required for bitcoin to run. They are not, you could technically have people doing the cryptographic calculations by hand, and send out their answers using pigeons.
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:01:47
Any miner who solves a block is allowed to determine whatever number of transactions that he wants to add. A miner can confirm 0 transactions, if that is what he wishes. Remember spending computer power also works to secure transactions in the chain below.

Yes, however this is known to be false taken the argument to extreme. Imagine a nation of teenage girls spending all they have. vs a nation of producer that only produce goods people want even if we assume they just gave them away to eachother(which they do given they all produce where the balance is sorted by who produces the best/most goods). From this extreme example it is clear to see why spending does not drive an economy.
The reason people are taught this is because government want to promote the idea that spending(the fun part) is what is important and as such they can just say they are promoting growth by spending tons of tax payer money. And noone calls them out on this because people was taught this wrongly.

While its really nice it is wrong on the very first paragraph.
It says Mortgage Crisis led to QE, when it is the exact opposite. Low interest rates and money printing(EI QE) led to the mortgage crisis.

My favorite: "Bitcoins is a digital currency you store in wallet on your computer"
I mean how dumb can you be???
Should be "Bitcoin is a digital currency stored on a decentralized global network of computers, your access to them is trough private key also known as your wallet which is stored on you personal computer".
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:31:15
LOL I like these explanations as they are overly complicated.
heres the thing:
You want to give your bitcoins to someone else.
What you do is you send to all computers in the entire network this transaction.
k? So now all computers in the entire network knows about you sending money to someone else.
What has to be done now is they need to archive this, so what happens is they put your transaction on a list of other peoples transaction. Since everyone can do this we need a mechanism that ensure only one computer does this.
To ensure only one computer does this, the computer has to solve a hard math problem, the problem is infact so hard that there is only about 1 computer that solves it every 10 minute. 
Once a computer has solved this arbitrary problem it sends the solution(also known as proof of work) out on the network, and if other computers in the network accept the solution then it validates the list of transactions(also known as a block).
As a reward for solving this problem the computer is rewarded some bitcoin(about 25). And this is what is referred to as mining.

Contrary to what OP and people think, the current fear mongering on reddit is actually a very healthy and good thing for bitcoins. Because without that we wouldn't be able to shake off speculators who don't understand the underlying value of bitcoins. And thus the bubbles would be much bigger. I didn't think bitcoins were worth 1000 dollar per coin today, but yet I still brought them at that price, simply because I didn't have time for the market to decide to drop. am I unhappy? no not really I still believe the bitcoin system will have a good prosperous road ahead of it. Personally I think there are still a bunch of speculators that are holding a large quantity of bitcoins and as such they will unload once the market slightly climb back. However that doesn't matter if you are long term bullish on bitcoins since the price should climb back up. And even if 1000per coin or 1300 as was suggest is the market price for bitcoins, then it will still continue to be a guard against inflation.
Fear good for long term of bitcoin. I believe It will drop further. Bitcoin fundamentals has not changed and are still sound.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:25:46
The intrinsic value of bitcoin is the value of people being able to transfer money. The reason why the drop occured is because people started to speculate that the value would increase, and thus any bad news will cause these people to sell off. The price should drop back to the value based on how much people use it to transfer value. Now this value might for now only be 200 and thus the value would drop to that.
This is very good for bitcoin since it shakes out people that didn't buy bitcoin because they thought it was a good investment.
