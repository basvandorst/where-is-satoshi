Is your "source code auditability" that blurb of javascript inside a modal on your homepage? I don't think many people will accept that as properly auditable at all. At least with Breadwallet/Copay there are direct links to github repo's with complete revision history and clear file structure and a visible build system.

Yo guys, I think we need to sound the alarm on this. There is NO WAY, given the current difficulty that this random previously-unheard of pool is legitimately solving this many blocks. Something is seriously awry here.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:45:32
So this couldn't happen today, for a few reasons. Mainly is that bitcoin (the process of running a piece of code to participate isn't well understood enough by enough people, yet). It would have to be be approximately as well understood as using a web browser itself, and we just aren't there yet.
Does every citizen of Russia download breadwallet or mycelium? Or do they download bitcoin-qt? 
Or does the Russian state buy up bitcoin using it's plummeting Rubles and then continue to issue paper money which is pegged to bitcoin?
How do they formally exchange their rubles for bitcoin if the Russian state chose to peg the two?
@_date: 2014-05-18 03:55:19
You're spot on, but if the exchange rate starts trending up, as it tends to do each time a new denominate-your-fiat-as-bitcoin service comes along, then will the users really be all that sad?
.... Until the inevitable crash.

do you have any citation for that? considering how hard engineers are working on making bitcoinj interact with tor, and that the functionality to choose a SOCKS proxy was added to bitcoin-qt bit later, this seems hard to swallow, albeit totally possible

Quoting "Bitcoin Internals" by Chris Clarke


The way that Bitcoin records ownership is based on an idea originally presented in 2005 by Ian Grigg called “Triple Entry Accounting”.[14] In this system, pay- ment receipts are not just verification that the ownership ledger changed, the receipts themselves are the ledger. It is called “triple entry” because the sender, receiver, and a third party all have a copy of the receipt and any single copy pro- vides sufficient proof of the transaction. Grigg explains how digital signatures can be used to sign the receipts so that they cannot be forged or repudiated. If Alice wants to send money to Bob, Alice creates a message that assigns a spec- ified quantity of her money to Bob and signs the message with her private key, much like a paper check. This signed message is the receipt of the transaction and anyone can use this receipt to confirm that Alice made the payment.
The third party in Grigg’s triple entry accounting system was a trusted authority that would issue money and verify that the sender had enough funds to make the payment. Bitcoin does not have any trusted authorities and must perform these checks differently.

@_date: 2017-02-02 01:38:49
In all the discussion over the years, this attribute of bitcoin doesn't get much play. When you die, if your wallet is encrypted with a password that only you know, your bitcoins die with you.
It seems in a sense that bitcoin was 'made for two' - if you have a life partner, the most crucial thing you can share with them is the password to your bitcoin private keys.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:30:42
Everyone's despair price depends on how long you've been in the game. I can remember the $30 -&gt; $2 crash, and I was DEVASTATED for buying at $18 and felt like a completely chump.
For people who bought at $800 despair is probably today's price.
The best way to price bitcoin is to think of the entire value of the network market cap (3.7B) and then ask yourself how much UTILITY &amp; VALUE is bitcoin creating? Is a global decentralized payments p2p payments network currently creating more or less than $3.7B in value?
Based on bitcoin's current usage (not a speculative investment) but as a real payments network, I think $3B is about right. You can buy a lot of stuff and use bitcoin a lot of places, but not a lot of people do, and thus the market cap sits where it is. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:01:10
actually you might be surprised to learn that bitcoin data in transit (as in over the wire) travels completely in the clear. bitcoin uses encryption for public/private keypairs to generate pubkeys and thus addresses, but it doesn't encrypt over the wire like pgp or the kind of thing that is being discussed to be banned here.

Thanks for bringing up technicals. You'll notice Bitcoin's RSI is above 70, and has been above 70 since May 27th. Short term breaks above 70 indicate an overbought asset. However, longer term breaks above 70 indicate a sustained bull market. It's quite unwise to sell into a bull market for any asset when it has a sustained (5+ trading day) RSI above 70, as it can indicate the rare of appearance of that mythical beast know amongst traders as alpha. Alpha, of course, is risk adjusted return, which judging from your comment, you don't get much of.
Some light reading:
 
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:34:54
History suggests otherwise. Selling at any time the RSI was above 70 in the last two years would've been a grave mistake.
Edit: Except for July 2015, when it went above 70 for only a day or so, which instead of a long term bull market is actually an 'overbought' situation and should be treated as such. It's the length of time that it remains above 70 that indicates the imbalance between buyers and sellers.

@_date: 2012-07-19 16:40:09
so if being redeemable in fiat paper coupons is the only way we actually synthesize scarcity in the current banking network, couldn't a bank theoretically 'lie' about how many electronic dollars it has on that network, and get away with it until it ran out of paper dollars (fiat floating coupons) ?

I'm asking -- unless all electronic currency is ultimately settled in fiat paper coupons -- what creates scarcity amongst this network? Couldn't I just endlessly enter electronic debt contracts?

You might be a little harsh here. I'm not too familiar with Windows 7 offline mode -- but I bet it just simply doesn't have an API for a web socket.

my post is longwinded, but in a nutshell, you could buy 1mb chain bitcoins, if there's a market maker, and sell 2mb chain bitcoins, and if somehow there was a switch back, the profits would be insane. It would be the largest re-org in the history of re-org being a concept.

It's been argued that it's a liability to the feasability of a nakamoto-concensus blockchain. The bitcoin network has a 'liability' to relay/propogate (by inserting into a block) your properly signed spend of that coin in the future, and holding that coin is a belief that such a liability will be upheld.

Bitcoin is a substitution for cash. So can you get a loan today in cash? Sure you can. It's up to the creditor to make sure that you are true to your debts. The same is true of bitcoin. I doubt anybody would loan cash anonymously, so why would they loan bitcoin anonymously. Similar logic applies.
