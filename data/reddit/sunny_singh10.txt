Maybe you should have show her the graph fro 2017 where BTC went from 800 to 11,500 it is at right now. 13x returns. 
Wonder what kind of returns her fiat $ is providing her

Thats my point. Lets not make fun of people that are buying fractions of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:39:24
Gotta realize that BTC is very expensive now. Not every has more than 10k spare just lying around to go buy a bitcoin. 
I see mBTC term is going to be used very often now.

LOL.... 
1. I think the 46k you are referring to I think was the 16.02 BTC. Just FYI 16*4k (price per BTC)=64k and not 46k.
2. When you get info off the blockexplorer, it the the info about the whole block, not just my transaction. The whole block contains 16BTCs, and my traction is a part of that block.

Mempool started growing last night at about 9 pm. 
The blocksize has grown to almost 1MB now. 
But the confirmed TX is still down:
what is going on?
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:52:13
Was doing some research on this and found:
So, the % error is (lambda/n)^1/2. 
I understand why you put n=2016 (number of observations), but lambda the mean, why did you take that as 1?
Also, this % error, what does this signify?
Sorry if I am not being the smartest.
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:39:06
So that means full nodes broadcast some "name" or some other information to say this node x is run by Coinbase or Bitmain?
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:53:56
So follow up question:
"malice (e.g. a miner attack)"
Why would a miner do this? This means miners ledger wouldnt be updated and all the POW done by the miner for the next block could all be a waste because the TX it would be processing in its block could already have been processes int he block that it rejected. 
Rejecting blocks for the mining node only makes sense, if it stops mining too?
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:11:26
This is a great book. Reading through it in detail. Thanks
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:54:52
What happens when a Node rejects a block that has been accepted by other Nodes. (This obviously will happen when my node is not synchronized with the network and ledger isn't updated).
Does my Node periodically check (i.e every 5 mins because there is no guarantee that there will be a block every 10 mins) with its peers that its ledger is updated?
What I am trying to understand is if my node goes out of sync with the network, how and when will my node recover using its peers?
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:14:43
So, I looked at the tx ID 
So it says Segwit enabled=True
But the script sig is still a part of the input and scriptpubkey is still a part of the output. 
I thought the whole concept of Segwit was moving two fields (among others) out of Inputs and outputs, and creating a witness script that isnt taken into consideration during the hash of the TX is being calculated. 
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:43:33
They are working on both. Plan is to get segwit, then lightening network. Then 4MB blocks, then 6MB blocks by the end of next year. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:00:10
Just fyi, I have been using the bitcoin wiki page to understand bitcoin. So, that my source of info.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:39:54
Ahh, ok that makes more sense. 
Am I correct in stating this?
So if n=2016 then % is 2%, but if n=4 then % is 50%.
And we dont want the % error to be as high as 50%. The lower the % error the more close we are going to be with the difficulty adjustment wrt to the network hast rate avg'ed out within the last 2016 block?
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:33:22
Wont it be less than 2% if it is not 2016 blocks, and is 2 or 4 blocks. 
Just curious as to why 2016 number was chosen, and not something smaller?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:52:36
Gotcha, sorry for being dumb and not using the correct terminology. 
Thanks for all this info. Appreciate it.
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:33:08
So, here is a real life example decentralization and trustlessness will solve. If you go on twitter, you see KimDotcom and Assange constantly complain how their tweets are being "banned", because they probably dont have the same political direction as twitter CEO does. With a decentralized systems, there will be no CEO, and there will be banning tweets because they dont match CEOs political ideas.
 
Another example, the shooting that happened in San Mateo at youtube HQ. The complain was that youtube algorithms were intentionally reducing the priority of this individuals videos. 
Another thing that wouldnt happen in a decentralized system.

How is this not obvious:
He said "BTC is not a security"
He didnt want to talk about Eth or any specific token. 
Eth was a security during the ICO process, but now it has a working platform, and it isn't a security. 
Same goes for projects that have working mainnets. 
They arent securities anymore. 
The new ICOs will all be securities. 
Projects that have gone through the ICOs process, but dont have a working product will be the ones that will be in the grey area.

@_date: 2018-06-15 08:30:11
So all full nodes are not equal? How do full nodes in the network decide this is a full node run by a miner or an exchange, and I will listen to this only. Do these nodes (exchanges and miners) broadcast some message like that?
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:52:16
Perfect!!! thanks for the info. Great explanation. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:59:46
I love BTC, and this it is the future. But to be accepted as a world wide currency we will have to fix these ridiculous conformation times. 
If I use venmo, and I receive $. I can instantly re-use it, for any other purchase. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:12:30
Done, thank you. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 10:18:04
Ahhh, ok. This just got clear. 
So at a protocol level all nodes are equal. (Mining, non mining, hosted by exchange, or hosted by me).
But Economic impact of mining nodes/exchange hosted nodes going rogue will be more to BTC.
 
Am I correct in stating that?
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:38:03
Nice explanation. Made things clear. 
Let me know if I understood this correct:
Block comes in. Full node checks the hash for previous block hash, and if it doesnt match its own ledger, then it pings its peers to download the latest block and then accepts the new block. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:08:12
Better, I think I understood it right, but didnt relay it correct. 
Even new block has a "previous block hash", when the new block goes to the FULL node, Full Node checks the previous block hash on this new block, and if it matches then the node knows it is in sync with the network. If it doesnt match then it checks with its peers and syncs the parent block it is missing.

I hates how 8mb blockchain was created in a haste without basically nay testnet. Been lucky that there havent been too many issues with replay protection and other. 
Technically I am against 8mb big block. 
I am in for 2mb blocks, but not in an attack method like 2X was, but a well tested way.
BTC is almost not affect by Mr Ver.
But BCH will go up in price once it is listed on coinbase.
We will have to live in a world where there will be BTC and BCH, we all just need to make peace with it.

If you looks at other countries they are encouraging BTC. US just passed a law that one doesnt have to pay taxes on a BTC tx under $600. Australian govt is looking into positive things with BTC ..etc..etc...Everyone else will accept BTC more if the Chinese govt bans it.

Ohh..come on!!!! Now Paris Hilton!!! These ICOs need to be stopped. They are robbing noobs and when noobs lose thousands of $, that gives crypto a bad name. 
I am all in for limited regulations for ICOs, where they have to have a working beta model to have an ICO. 
In for the regulations US and Chinese govts are applying on shitty ICOs.

Yes, when people say the market cap of crypto is about say $300B. Doesnt mean $300B has gone in. 
It is usually 50:1 or 40:1. So lets say 50:1. That means $6B has flowed into crypto. 
Same will go the other way too. If 10B comes in, then technically market cap should go up 500B.

The people in India who have $ in banks will not be the big time market movers from India (even in the future). the middle class (the ones those are the highest % that use banks dont have the $ to buy BTC). The main $ in India is with the top 1% and with the dirty politicians. And those guys keep the money in cash, and off-shore. 
I would assume if there ca be a OTC trade desk in India for the people with illegal $ that would flourish. Other than that India will not be a big market mover even though it has a huge population. 
That because most of that population is dirt poor, and the middle class is just getting by (not having enough $ to through around on crypto)

I was curious about BTC and BCC: 
So BTC total market cap right now is about 40+Bil with coin trading at about $2500. BCC "futures" is supposed to be around $400. 
Now when a chain split occurs on Aug 1st, does that mean the market cap is going to be split into two?
i.e if BCC is trading at about $400, then the price of BTC should drop to $2100 (to add up to the market cap due to the split).
Am I correct with this analysis?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:19:35
BTC about to hit $2900
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:56:33
Here is my understanding of the fork. Suppose post fork we have BTC (Bitcoin) and BTCC (Bitcoin classic). One owns 10 BTCs as of right now, does that mean post fork one will own 10 BTCs and 10 BTCCs? And then can make the necessary movements? Trying to understand how the existing funds will work.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:45:34
Looks like BCC will be a shit coin. That will be sold of asap, and will crash and burn. The future prices has already dropped from high 500s to high 200s in a few days. Not looking good for Bitcoin Cash
