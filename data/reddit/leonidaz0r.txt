But the transaction count was not high. See here

That is interesting. When did fees start to be set dynamically?

This is quite ironic retrospectively, after the cause has been determined. You were the only one circlejerking here ;)

Any idea why the demand was up at the end of 2013? It was when MtGox crashed. However as the transaction count was not high, there is not really any more demand.

You are correct. I found it in the release notes of version 0.10.
Thanks a lot, that explains it. Therefore we can expect the fees to rise until we get bigger blocks or something else to scale better.

The blockchain space in 2013 was not nearly filled, there was much more supply, than could be filled in any way. The situation just does not match. Clients were not even aware of the market until February 2015, where the market was introduced with Bitcoin Core 0.10.
The other commenter was right.

That are monthly averages and actually it seems to have happened over more than a month

Answered on the wrong post, see one level up.

Any group of people can create a channel factory in layer 2. Just find a few friends and do it, nothing centralized.

A group of nodes is called a "Channel Factory". So the new layer is basically the "Channel Factory Layer".

Thanks for pointing this out.
