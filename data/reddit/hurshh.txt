What would stop me from printing "bitcoin bills" and selling them to the elderly as bitcoin when they really are just scraps of paper? Nothing. And if thwy dont know how to use the internet (the people you are making this for) then they will never even know they got scammed until they try to spend the fake money. The very fact that you are trying to make this for people without internet is exactly why it wouldn't work. And if you make it for people  who DO have internet and btc knowledge,  then they would simply not buy btc in paper form because that defeats the entire purpose of btc.

Bitcoin core is not BTC. BTC is just bitcoin.  Bitcoin core and bitcoin cash are different than btc

What this guy said. Yes these actually produce. If they didn't than nobody would be mining. There is some info on how to mine in the info on this sub. I don't mind myself but my friend does and he makes money even when he's paying for electric. So you should be able to make quite a bit more with free electricity. People are shutting you down because MANY MANY people have tried to get free electricity from work/apartments and it backfired. If you feel confident that isn't going to be you,  then go for it!

I watched the whole thing.  No btc was mentioned

A YouTuber with over 250k subs made this video and in it you can see at the start that he is messing with BTC (Obviously fake but its to show why he is making this) kinda need. Not something I would ever use though.  At least 250k more people will see that BTC logo tho!

Wow... reading through that 5 year old thread was eye opening for  me... really put Things into perspective for me.

use a bitcoin atm
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:07:47
1. Buy a Ledger s nano.
2. Sell the btc on robinhood. You can't withdraw it from there. 
3. Then use the money to buy btc using coinbase pro. 
4. Then withdraw the BTC from coinbase pro onto your ledger s nano. 
5. Profit because you now own your own Bitcoin for once ^.^

Coinbase is not BAD its just not ideal. For beginners its just fine. For someone like yourself who wants to learn and get started coinbase is great.  Our recommendation is that you learn how to get BTC off of coinbase sooner rather than later. The sooner the better. 
The reason for that is because by having the btc on coinbase you are not in control of the btc. Coinbase is in control. Kinda like when you keep money in a bank. Sure the money in that bank is yours but in reality the bank is the one who has the money. Not you.  
A secondary reason is that by having the BTC on coinbase you are supporting a big company being in control of part of the BTC economy. The less control they have the better. The more people who control their own btc the better. Keep BTC decentralized. 
TL;DR coinbase isn't bad, but keeping btc off coinbase is good.

This is terribly written... bathroom humor and pure bias. I'm not a supporter of BCash at all but the article did not need to be written like this. The charts speak for themselves that bcash is dying. He didnt need to discredit himself by making such trashy and biased remarks through the whole article
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:11:39
For me it's not the price. Would happily pay it if it took less than half a second to do. But ain't nobody got time to be paying a fraction of a penny every time you want to read a Reddit post... open it up see a paywall and move along to the next post. You undersetimate the laziness of people in general. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:56:55
Awesome stuff.  Commenting so I can come back later when btc  hits 20k again lol

Can I buy a small stack of the largest bills you have from you OP? I can pay in BTC of course if you would mail them to me.
