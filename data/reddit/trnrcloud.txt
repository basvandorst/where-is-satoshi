"Enabling "Post Only" when creating a limit order will ensure that your limit order is posted to the order book and sits on the order book to be charged a Maker Fees if it is filled. If any part of the order would execute immediately due to its price when arriving at the matching engine, the entire order will be rejected. This is useful for ensuring that an order is not subject to Taker Fees, if desired."

I'm sure the bitcoin hack that occurred a couple of hours ago had an influence on this. I started small with $100 and basically could have sold at $402 right before it crashed. :(

I don't think BitCoins will ever be worthless. Depending how much and when you make the purchase, you can lose money. Regardless, it's probably a good idea to invest something into BitCoins especially now that it's fluctuating between $15k and $16k after reaching $19k 3 hours ago. I'm sure it will go back up eventually.
I started with $100 and don't know much about investing. Just started out last week. I made about $300 buying/selling. It's not much but it's $300 more than I had invested into it.

Eventually, a new cryptocurrency will emerge in the form of 3 different currencies that will help balance each other out. We'll all have to have these new wallets embedded into our hands in the form of a chip(Similar to the ones Credit Cards now have.) that will hold these three currencies(maybe more?). We would need this to buy and sell goods and it will probably be created, or started, by a die hard deep web fan that will want to brand the currency as WWW for world wide web (666 in Hebrew).

I tried posting earlier but got filtered out. There's a youtube video explaining there was a huge BitCoin Hack maybe 2.5 hours ago? I'm sure it's affecting a lot of these sites.

Hope I placed this in the right spot. I haven't seen a post about this yet. But thought this may be helpful to know.

I believe it's up again? I can't tell. There's no buying or selling activity. It's currently at $16,299.99

I honestly don't see that anymore secure than an online wallet since it's an app. And as SharkLaserrrrr stated, it has to be connected to the internet.
I use the Ledger Nano S. I prefer this over other wallets. Simple to use and set up. There's also YouTube videos that show how to set one up. Only issue I had is the cost, which if you look on Amazon, you may find a good price.

Keep getting the "whoops" screen when I log in. I like how it always says "Minor Service Outage" regardless of what's going on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:43
yup...I'm getting the "Whoops!" page. But it's okay...It's only a Minor Service Outage....

It's up now.
