You're welcome. One more tip for you: If you do any buys/sells at GDAX, do them as Limit Orders to avoid trading fees (Market orders have a fee, Limit orders are free).
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:59:15
Go to GDAX (on the web). It's owned by Coinbase, so if you're registered/verified at Coinbase, you can login at GDAX. Then transfer your coins from Coinbase to GDAX (click Deposit at GDAX, pick Coinbase as funding source). Transfers are free and instant back and forth between Coinbase and GDAX. 
At GDAX, you can trade BTC for ETH or LTC (or buy/sell any of them). And if you want to transfer your coins out of GDAX (to a wallet or any other address), it's free. GDAX pays the fee, so it costs you nothing.

ETH's huge bull run is what immediately preceded this massive crypto sell off. I'm not suggesting it's singularly to blame, but it's certainly not any better behaved than any other.

So true.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:55:36
This is my feeling. I think there will be some initial craziness just because people are a little panicked about it, but other than that, I don't think it'll have any major impact on the market.

Just to clarify, I didn't buy $16k worth of BTC, I bought some BTC *at* the $16k price.

If you look at the upward slope of the price chart over the past two months, it had a fairly steady angle to it until the last week of November. By "natural progression", I mean projecting that original slope out to now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:57:22
^ This.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:15
I tried day trading today with $150's worth of BTC just for fun. It was very tough and very intense trying to see a trend starting and then jump in before it reversed (especially with how crazy it was today). I ended up with a small gain before calling it quits. The main thing I learned is that it's not just about timing, there's also some luck involved. 
If you really want to try it, I'd suggest doing what I did and just use a small amount to test the waters. At least that way it's not devastating if you lose it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:03
Correct. Buying low and selling high is tricky business, though. Be careful out there!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:18:47
Yep. I guess now we know those price alerts can't be relied on for timeliness.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:20
I think a pretty $5k drop right at the time that lots and lots of new people were getting into it is definitely going to set it back a bit. As for the division (I assume you mean between btc &amp; bch), I agree that that's one of the worst things to happen to bitcoin in general, but people new to crypto don't even know about that. I don't even get why this battle between the two coins exists. They're *two different coins*. Each one should just stand on its own. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:52:42
I think January is more likely for 20k. You never know, though; we could be up there a week from now.

You can invest in bitcoin without paying any fees: Deposit fiat money into GDAX. Buy BTC using limit maker order. Withdraw BTC to your wallet address. Fees paid: 0. 
Where fees come into play is if you want to move the btc between exchanges, send btc to someone else's wallet or buy something using btc as the payment method. I hope the ability to move btc around like that will improve next year, but for people who are investing/accumulating to hold for a while, fees are not even an issue.

No. On GDAX, you have to deposit the money first, which takes about a week to clear. But once you've got money there, your BTC (or LTC or ETH) is available in your account as soon as you buy it. And if you do buys/sells as limit orders, there are no fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:04:37
It's like transaction purgatory. It's where bitcoin transactions go and wait to be added to a block by miners.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:20
On Coinbase, you can buy using your linked bank account as payment method and then they hold the bitcoin for a week while they pull the money from your bank account. You can also buy there with a credit card.

Doesn't Gemini charge a fee for every trade (even limit orders)? I found their pricing a bit confusing when I read about it, but that was my understanding and it's what's kept me from trying them. I like to do small day trades, which I can do on GDAX without any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:26:54

@_date: 2017-12-25 06:44:36
How is it funny? New buyers enter the market all the time and the advice doled out to them is always: *best time to buy was yesterday, second best time is today*. But everyone who bought above 14k is screwed right now and everyone who bought above 10k is at risk right now, even if it's only temporary. That's a lot of people and a lot of money on the line. Whether they can afford to lose it or not, it's not "fucking hilarious".
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:04:44
1. Move them to GDAX first, *then* to your wallet so there won't be a fee for the transfer. 
2. Copy and paste your wallet address into the withdraw field and then *double check* it. 
3. Don't panic if it takes 2 hours to show up in your wallet.

Most of my buys are under $9k, but I've got a recent one at $16k. It's definitely painful to watch the price drop after a buy, but yeah, it'll get back up there and continue to grow over time. I don't even know why, but I've been enjoying the roller coaster ride too.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:05:18
No, I'm not in a loss because I cost averaged. But people who bought bitcoin later than I did are definitely sitting in loss positions and I just don't get how anyone could find that funny. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:32:50
I'd actually be surprised if it didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:31:49
Not sure why you're having trouble with the settings section, but all it has is your profile info: name, email address, type of account (ie. individual) and your daily withdraw limit. Then there is a section for security settings and a section for payment methods. Both of those simply link you back to Coinbase to set up. 
So just set up your bank account stuff in Coinbase. Once you've got that done, you can just click "deposit" on GDAX and your bank account will already be listed there to select for your funding source.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:40:52
No. Not having any problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:03
If you didn't even have to explain to your wife and kids why most of the furniture went missing, I don't think they're going to be phased by your poor financial decisions ;)   
But yeah man, the price will rise again. Could be a week, a few weeks or even a few months, but it'll climb back up there. Just sit tight and find ways to tighten your budget in the meantime. And please don't ever put your financial stability (and that of your family) at risk again. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Everyone in here believes bitcoin will continue to rise over time, but no investment is ever a sure thing.

It's always disappointing when the price drops after a buy, but don't panic. It just climbed too high too fast and the price is correcting and building support for a slower, stronger climb. It'll get back up there. Just HODL.

Attack isn't really the right word. It was a manipulation by people who are wealthy enough to do it. Free market and all that, but the sad thing is how much damage it's probably done to crypto newbies (who likely got scared right back out of it). Stunts like this set back the hope of mass adoption.

I keep a small amount of btc on GDAX to play with when the market's dropping. I only make tiny gains by selling and rebuying, but it's fun and keeps me from panicking when prices are going down. The rest stays safe in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:24
Move it from Coinbase to GDAX. Then either use GDAX or transfer from GDAX to the exchange of your choice.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:56
I've made .00044! LOL. I've managed to gain with every trade, I'm just only playing with a tiny amount for fear of losing it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:47:04
No one knows, but if you want a guess, I think it might go as low as $12k. Around $11k is where the buying frenzy really seemed to go vertical. A "price correction" would presumably bring it back down to where the price would be had it followed a more natural progression. And my estimation on that is $12k-$13k.    
Of course, I could be completely wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:55:28
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:21:29
It actually would be. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:47:55
Sounds like you bought on Coinbase with your linked bank account? If so, the price was locked in when you bought it (meaning you'll get the amount you bought at the price it was when you bought).
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:49:38
There's no reason to be. Coinbase is good for getting started because it's easy, but once you've gotten your feet wet, GDAX is the way to go. It's the same company too, by the way -- GDAX is the exchange and Coinbase is like the brokerage. You do have to prefund your account on GDAX before you can make a buy there, though. And make sure you do *limit* orders for buying or selling to avoid fees (market orders do have a fee).
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:11:57
I don't know about other exchanges, but on GDAX, there are no fees for limit buys/sells and no fee to transfer your BTC off of there to your private wallet.

Use GDAX instead of Coinbase. GDAX is Coinbase's trading platform -- same company, so once you're verified  on one, it's easy to jump over to the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:18
I've been wondering about this too.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:23:31
Coinbase is actually a great entry point because it's easy. They do charge fees, so you're not going to get the best price, but for a first small dollar buy, I recommend it. Once you've got some bitcoin and want to trade with it, buy more or transfer your btc out to a wallet, sign into GDAX (Coinbase's trading platform on the web). GDAX has no fees to transfer btc out and no fees for buying and selling if you do it as limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:09
It was 12/11, but I think that was an estimate by CME. 12/18 is now a firm date.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:39:58
If you have fiat money deposited at Coinbase, you can transfer it to GDAX instantly. You hit "deposit" on GDAX, pick Coinbase as the source and the money transfers from Coinbase to GDAX instantly. You can move fiat or crypto back and forth between Coinbase and GDAX instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:10:31

I think it's genuine. A lot of noobs (like me) started at Coinbase because it was the simplest entry into the market. And once you've got something there, it makes sense to try GDAX before venturing out to another exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-02 06:36:10
We all would, which is why no matter how hard it might crash, the price will climb back up fairly quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:35:29
Yes it's normal and done for privacy. If you use the same address every time, someone could look it up on the blockchain and see all the transactions attributed to that address. 
I use bread app and that provides a new receiving address every time too, but you can still reuse a prior address if you want and it'll work. I assume this is typical of all wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:04:18
Yep yep. I'd been thinking there'd be a dip into the 6500-6700 range and when it got down there today, I was so bummed I didn't have my money available yet. Ah well, I'm still pretty new to buying bitcoin, so I'm sure it's not the first missed opportunity I'll experience. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:33:01


Yes. If you do a maker limit buy/sell, you avoid fees. 


When a buy is executed, you'll see the BTC show up in your GDAX account instantly, so if you wanted to immediately turn around set up a sell order, on GDAX you could. And vice versa.


I've not transferred any BTC *to* GDAX, but transferring BTC out of GDAX to my wallet has taken about 1 1/2-2 hours each time for me (and it's free -- no fees). If you transfer it out of Coinbase, though, they charge a fee (except when transferring between Coinbase and GDAX -- that's instant and free either way).


It takes about 7 business days for bank transfer of USD to get into Coinbase/GDAX. I don't think you can transfer USD from there to another exchange. You'd have to either withdraw it back to your bank and then deposit at another exchange or buy coin and transfer that to your wallet on another exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:18:37
Me too. Sitting here waiting for the next dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:22

I'm going to assume op meant 3/4 of the money he had for investing (meaning money he could afford to lose), in which case, yes, that's a good strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:21
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:54:47
The price is locked in the moment you "buy" (on Coinbase) even though you don't actually get the BTC until your payment clears (which can take up to a week). So whatever fluctuation happens in the market (up or down) during that wait time doesn't change your purchase price. 
If you already had money in a GDAX account (or any other crypto exchange), then you could make an instant buy of bitcoin whenever you wanted at whatever the price it was at that moment. But if you need to deposit money first, the price of bitcoin could change dramatically in the days that you're waiting for your deposit to get there. Maybe the price would drop and you'd be glad you had to wait to buy or maybe it'd go up and you'd be bummed that you had to wait.
One other thing to note is that Coinbase and GDAX are the same company, so if you have cash or coin on Coinbase, you can transfer it instantly over to GDAX to sell or buy more if you want. And if you do transactions there as posted limit orders, there are no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:19:38
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:43:28


Correct. The exchange will have a "wallet" that your bitcoin sits in when you buy it, but until you transfer it to a wallet that you hold the private keys too, it is always at risk. 
I can't help with quadrigacx and Trezor questions, but I'm sure someone else can.

^ That's your problem right there. And I think most newcomers feel that some extent. It's a heightened FOMO, fueled by the regret of not buying sooner. I'll call it ROMO... regret of missing out! 
And there's also the noobie thing of obsessively watching the market because it's new and exciting to you. But every increment upwards, just makes you anxious that you don't have more in bitcoin yet. You might feel like you're way late in getting into bitcoin, but keep in mind that you're way ahead of the vast majority of people. 
And for god's sake, don't take out any more loans! The market could take a dive and then your obsessive desire to buy more MORE MORE could turn to massive depression. So take a breath, stop watching the market and go do something else for a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:15:16
Okay, thanks. It took a week for my money to transfer when I did the   instant buy method with Coinbase (lock in the BTC price and then wait to get it while the money transfers). I'd *hoped* pre-funding my USD wallet this time would be quicker.

Coinbase/GDAX is safe to use, but DO NOT take out a loan to buy bitcoin. The market is flying high *right now*, but could take a downward turn any time and stay low for months. Could you afford to have your investment tied up in a loss position for any length of time? How would you make payments on the loan? This is why you should only invest what you can afford to lose. 
If you want in on bitcoin, start setting some money aside -- a little here, a little there, and maybe you can buy some in a few weeks time. In the meantime, you could register at Coinbase and get verified (so you'll be ready when you do have money to invest).

Just for fun, I bought $1's worth of Bitcoin from an ATM a little over 2 years ago. Recently came across my paper receipt, so I downloaded a wallet, scanned it in and holy smokes, my little $1 was worth $11. 
"Wow, I'd wish bought more when I spent that $1, but oh well, I missed the boat and it's too expensive now."
Next time I check, my $1 was worth $18. 
"Holy smokes! It's still going up! Why didn't I buy last time I checked it?!"
I finally came to my senses and have bought $1000 worth over the past week. Late, yes. Regrets, plenty. And my investment still much lower than I'd like, but hey, it's a start and at least I'm in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:23
That's why the price won't leave the 9000s. Until a meme exists that can top 9000 vegeta, we are in bitcoin stasis.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:41:47
Yes. I think you can buy as little as $1's worth through Coinbase, but make sure you look up their fees first. If you're buying such a small amount, it might not be worth it to use them and you might be better off just buying paying a higher rate at a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:33:49
I have the same feeling (or maybe it's just my hope because I'd like to get another buy in under $7k). I was sitting here watching the price dip a few a hundred tonight and thought, nah, this isn't the dip I'm waiting for.

If you want to be ready to sell, keeping some on an exchange makes sense. I have a small amount sitting on an exchange for that purpose. You just need to be aware that you *could* lose them all if something catastrophic happened to the exchange, so whatever you intend to hold for a while should be in your own wallet that you hold the private keys to.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:02:34
GDAX and Coinbase are the same company, so the simplest thing is to hop over to GDAX, login there and do a limit buy (market buys have fees, limit buys don't). If you already have USD sitting in Coinbase, you can move it to GDAX instantly (on GDAX, click deposit and pick Coinbase account as the funding source). Also, it's free to transfer your bitcoin out of GDAX to your wallet. If you happen to have bitcoin still sitting at Coinbase, you can transfer it to GDAX then to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:47:35
Actually, they do ask for your bank username and password if you pick a bank on their list. To get around that, you can pick "other" (even if you see your bank on the list) and then it'll ask for your account number and routing number instead of login and password.

And what about when it crosses 10k? 
Sure, there might be a correction, but it will climb back up again. Or, there might not be a correction and that hair-below-10k it's still sitting at will look like a missed opportunity. Flip a coin and make your choice.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:20:46
If I didn't already have a bank transfer pending, I would've too. Sometimes those fees are worth it to seize an opportunity. Congrats on your buy!
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:41:52
Ask again later
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:44:55
No, you can't buy instantly with your linked bank account like you can through Coinbase. On GDAX, you have to already have the USD in there. 
You *could* transfer USD from your bank to Coinbase and then move it to GDAX, but you can also just transfer USD from your bank directly to GDAX (click "deposit" on GDAX and a window pops up for you to select your bank account to initiate a USD deposit from). 
Just be warned that whether you transfer money from bank to Coinbase or from bank to GDAX, the "4 days" they'll say it takes is wrong and it usually takes a full 7 *business* days. If you're really antsy to buy, it can feel like a looooong week and there are times that you might wish you'd just paid the fee on Coinbase to do an instant buy. But if you're in this for the long haul and planning to do regular buys for a while, getting a money transfer routine going makes sense.

Coinbase sent out an email on Nov 1 that said: 
We wanted to remind you that the upcoming Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16 and will result in 2 bitcoin blockchains. 
In our effort to make Coinbase the most trusted, safe, and easy-to-use digital currency exchange, we are working to ensure we maximize your benefit from this event. So, following the fork: 
Any user storing Bitcoin on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the new Bitcoin2x asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required - we will automatically credit your account. If you have 5 Bitcoin stored on Coinbase before the fork, you will have 5 Bitcoin and 5 Bitcoin2x following the event.
Coinbase users will be able to trade both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x shortly after the fork.
Coinbase will disable buys, sells, sends and receives for Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x approximately 24 hours before the fork. We will re-enable them following the fork once it’s safe to do so.
For a detailed timeline of events surrounding the fork please see our blog post and FAQ. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:28:45
Congratulations! 
I wouldn't worry about storing a small amount of bitcoin at Coinbase. But in general, it's not a good idea to let them or anyone else be the custodian of your bitcoin. If you move it to a private wallet, *you'll* have the private key/recovery phrase, making it *your* bitcoin. 
People always recommend hardware wallets, but when you're just getting started, it's a bit much. Just get a mobile wallet for now. Bread App is a good one if you've got an iphone, but there are plenty of suggestions floating around here for both android or ios.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:44:11
On Coinbase, the price is the price. If you want to set your own price, jump over to GDAX (Coinbases's echange platform). On there, you can set up a limit buy in which you specify your price. Doesn't mean you'll successfully make a purchase at the price you want, but you can always cancel a limit order that hasn't executed yet and try again with a different price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:02:34
What ducksauce88 was saying is that you can do an instant buy on Coinbase with your linked bank account as the payment method even if you haven't transferred any funds in ahead of time. There's a 1.5% fee to do that, but the buy price gets locked in. And of course you don't actually get your bitcoin until the funds clear (about a week). It doesn't help you right now since you have a money transfer in progress; just an option to keep in mind in case you want to do it that way in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:39:43
"3-5 days" in Coinbase time usually means 7 business days in reality. If they cancelled your order on the 20th, the money will probably be back in your bank account on the 29th. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:41:15
I got that a few times last night while trying to set up a limit buy order.

Yes, that's an "off chain" transaction ID that's internal to GDAX. I don't think you'll actually find your transaction on the blockchain unless you were to transfer it off of GDAX (to your wallet, for example), then search for the address you sent it to.

Have you already done ID verification on Coinbase? If not, maybe that's why they're asking for more info to get set up at GDAX (although I've never heard of them asking for employer info and can't imagine why they'd need that!). Here's their help page about registering: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:02:53
Hope so. I couldn't partake of any tasty dippage this weekend because I'm still waiting for my bank transfer to post. It'd be nice if there was another dip when my funds are available.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:07:00
Yes, if you buy on Coinbase, your buy price is locked in, you just don't get your bitcoin until the money from your bank transfers in (which generally takes a week). You have to suck up the Coinbase 1.49% fee when you do it that way, but if you want to take advantage of a current price, it's worth doing.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:50:09
This is a great idea!
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:39:22
The thing with Coinbase locking in the price is when you make an instant buy with your linked bank account as the payment method. In doing that, Coinbase essentially reserves the bitcoin for you at the price you "bought" it at and then pulls the money from your bank account to cover the sale. Once they receive money, they put the BTC in your account. 
With GDAX, you can't make a buy that way; you have to transfer money into your account first. But once you have money in your account, you can make a market buy instantly (although there's a fee for market orders) or set up a limit order to buy a specified amount of BTC at a specified price (that doesn't exceed how much money you have in your account). If/when the market meets your price, the buy executes and your bitcoin is immediately available in your account.

The last few small dips, I hesitated hoping for a bigger price drop and ended up missing out. So this time, I grabbed some at 7890. If it goes lower later tonight, I'll buy more. If not, at least I didn't let a dip pass me by this time.

This is the mindset I need to adopt. I keep waiting for *just* the right time to drop the money I have in-waiting on more BTC. But I enjoy watching the exchange and following the news, so I'd probably do better in the long run and have more fun if I made smaller buys more frequently rather than larger buys spread further apart.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:48:23
Yes, it's normal. It generally takes a week for the transaction to complete and your bitcoins to be available to you. The alternative is to pre-fund your Coinbase account by transferring money from your bank account. That process takes a week too, but once the money is in there, any buy(s) you make with it would be immediate.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:35:07
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:51:07
At this point, I'm kicking myself for not buying at the $7100 mark! My money deposit missed the big dip last weekend and it was around 7100 and climbing when I could make a buy. I thought, eh, I'll wait for the next dip. D'oh! It's gotta dip eventually, right? RIGHT?!
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:41:37

No. I sent from GDAX to my wallet last week and it didn't show up in my wallet for about an hour and a half. Then it said processing for about another half hour or so before it was complete. Fear not, it'll arrive eventually.
EDIT: Oh and I don't recall if mine showed up on the blockchain as soon as it showed as "processing" in my wallet or after it was completed.

In 7 days? I really think it could go either way. The buying frenzy that's driving up the price so fast could lead to a sell-off from people looking to cash out some profit. But beyond that? You will more than double your investment.

Some have it, others want it! Well, that's the market value side of things anyway. But its intrinsic value comes from the fact that it's a decentralized, trustless, deflationary currency, the transactions of which are logged into a public ledger (the blockchain).

It's not theoretical, you can buy it or sell it right now for "real" money. Or you can spend it like regular currency at some places that accept it. But I think most of us are buying it and holding it as an investment because the price has shown tremendous growth over time. Like any investment, though, it's a gamble, so it's not wise to buy in with more money than you could afford to lose.

Beginning of April (well, any time between now and the end of the first week of April). I think we're in a symmetrical triangle that, as of now, will end on April 7th. But the break out (could be up or down, though I think up) will likely happen before then.

The whole reason for the HODL meme is stop people from panic selling during volatility. Selling and rebuying lower is fine. Selling because you want to cash out is fine. But if your intention is to hold long term and then you panic sell during a drop, you risk chasing the price back up and buying back in higher. So if you aren't good at trading or don't want to trade, you should just hold.

I think if low 6s were coming they'd have been here by now. The push downward has been relentless for weeks (save for the pumps, but those were only set ups for dumps). There probably just aren't enough weak hand panic sellers left in the market to fuel the momentum needed for a new low.

@_date: 2018-03-30 04:30:28
I'm definitely not feeling any sense of fomo. But in terms of selling and rebuying, I prefer to keep trading my way down incrementally rather than sell it all and wait for a bottom that won't be known except in hindsight.

It could go up or down because either formation is in play. But based on the trading formations right now, you can see that if it goes below 8250 but stays above 8190, then it's much more likely that the price will rise to 8400 in the short term rather than fall to 7900. Chart reading isn't perfect, but it can give you a good guide of what's likely to happen. And even if you're not into trading, it can help steel your nerves for holding when you understand some of the ups and downs of the price.

Just want you to know that you're not alone. Plenty of us are completely underwater because, well, we just wanted to buy bitcoin and were naive about the whole crypto market being massively inflated at the time. Yeah, we could've sold on the way down, but hindsight is 20/20 and how could we know how far this would fall (or still will fall)? Don't beat yourself up. It's a loss for now, but it'll eventually come back to whatever price you paid. It's been to 19k before, so it's sure to get there again (I'd guess within a year). Hang in there, okay?

@_date: 2018-02-02 07:34:04
It rose very high, very fast last fall and the price has been correcting downward for the last several weeks. Technically, that price correction is done now, but when you add some panic selling into the mix (*lots* of new people entered the market last fall) and some price manipulation by rich guys, it doesn't necessarily stop predictably. So we're sort of teetering between going even further down or leveling off soon and beginning a reversal.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:29:01
Lower. But I think it's highly unlikely that everyone who entered the bitcoin market over $999 is out and planning to stay out.

Anyone else feel like they'll be the only person left holding bitcoin when this is over? It can't sustain any upward movement at all because literally everyone is selling.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:44:59
Patience is fine, but holding in a loss position for 4 years wouldn't make any sense at all. If it was *really* going to take that long to climb back to 19k (it won't take anywhere near that long), it would make more sense to sell, even right here at the bottom, put the money into stocks and gold for the next year or so and come back to buy bitcoin when it crawls out of that hypothetical 4-year grave.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:46:03
Would you pay $100k for a bitcoin right now? How about $11k? Whether you believe in fundamentals or not, every investment is driven by its market value.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:00:45
Based on what?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:44:11
I think bitcoin is too big now to stay in the doldrums for a long as it did before. I don't mean that in the "too big to fail" kind of way, I mean *lots* more people know about it and too many have bought it for it to stay low for too long. As soon as it starts showing real signs of ticking up, people will start jumping back in.

No. Might it? Sure, but it doesn't *need* to. It already had a 70% from the ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:55:15
When you expect it, it probably won't happen.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:43:02
Every leg down, I think we get another wave of people cutting their losses because they assume it's still going to go lower and they can buy back in then. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:22:12
I figure that's already factored into the current fall. But you're right, it still is an unnkown.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:06:33
Mine is as of today. I started buying at 5.6k, but was putting in a little every week or two. By the time I'd finished putting all the money into bitcoin that I was going to, it was over 18k. I remember hesitating to put more in when it crossed 11k. It started going up so fast at that point that something just felt wrong. But being new to the market, I didn't know any better and quickly replaced that thought with *the longer I wait, the more expensive it will be*. And instead of holding back, I just continued to buy until I'd finished putting in all the money I'd allocated for it.

Buying $635 worth of bitcoin at $8248 would get you .077 btc (.07698836), not .77 btc. If you then sold it at 10k, you'd make $769.88, so $134.88 profit.

Nothing but a tired meme now.

Not before a huge sell off in the 16-20k range first. *Then* it'll be onward to 20 then 30 and beyond.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:38:38
I don't know about *high profile* people, but I saw a couple posts last night from people who'd said they'd hold long and ended up selling. Maybe they were more recent holders, I don't know.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:50:00
I'm right behind you. I made buys in Oct, Nov &amp; Dec and had planned to hold for 1-5 years until it would either be valuable for spending or selling. It already stings knowing now that I bought at what turned out to be the beginning and end of a massive bull run. But I've traded my way to a better cost average, so I'm sticking it out and staying with my plan to hold.
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:24:50
I think we're just used to seeing it go down (also the drops are small these days).
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:48:20
Because they think the price is still going lower.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:19
No. Why would anyone jump from one crash to another?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:47
This. I get so tired of people who say if you're upset about the price dropping, it's because you invested more than you could afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:45:10
Ah well, it was nice while it lasted. We're below the lowest correction point now so there's nothing to stop it. It will go down until the btc-rich people who are driving it down are done with whatever their plan is. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:07:31
I feel like there's a "buttcoin" joke in here somewhere.

It's felt that way for a week now.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:48:42
I don't know if we'll drop more or not (overall sentiment seems to be that we will, but I'm not convinced from looking at the chart). If we do, though, I have 8500 pegged for a potential low. I've had that marked on my chart for a while now because it's the range we hovered around in after jumping out of the 5900 dive (and before we had that little bull run to over 11k). It's also a point where the 50 and 200 EMA crossed (on the 1 hour chart), which is apparently significant, but I don't know enough about that stuff to know why.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:01:14
Of this, I have no doubt.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:34:21
Yeah but you saved a whole month of daily misery. And *next* month, it'll be better than today. Has to be, right?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:01:25
If they kill bitcoin on Good Friday, will it rise from the dead on Easter Sunday?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:41:25
I'm not actually comfortable with losing anything, though! Afford, yes, comfortable, no ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:59
If all the speculators were out of bitcoin, there would be no one in bitcoin. Even those who bought it for $.10 or $100 were speculating (and many of them sold, profiting hugely over the past several months). My feeling is that this push to the bottom is more a desire for a do-over than finding a real value for the technology.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:50:54
I'll be happy if we break through 8300 today and hold it. That would at least get us out of the down trend of the last 9 days. But I'd certainly be happier if we broke 9k!
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:49:50
This is when looking at a chart can be helpful. The tight range of trading can help you figure out where it might go next. It's either forming a bear pennant that could take it down to 7900 or it's forming a falling wedge that could take it up to 8400. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:45:31
Never underestimate the power of FOMO. All it takes is a few days of the price rising for people to want back in.

My husband thought it was silly when I started putting money into it, but then he started hearing about it on the news, talking about it with coworkers, reading about it and next thing you know, he wanted me to put more money in. So we did, then it crashed. But because we're both very bullish on bitcoin long term, we're holding and riding out the storm.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:03
Where's the bottom? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:04:04
Wish I'd gotten in sooner, of course, but I made my first buy last week when it was at $5600. Wheeeeeeee!

More pics of my costume:
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:39:37
That's me!
I wore the costume Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights at Dragon Con and the response I got from other con goers was *amazing*. There were high fives all over the place and lots of happy shouts of "Bitcoin!" and "To the moon!" One person even said "I bought my house with you!" 
While I was standing at a corner, waiting to cross the street on Saturday night, a passing car stopped, put down the window and yelled out something like "Bitcoin, yes!"
The costume only elicited one negative comment the entire time: "You ruin people's lives." (Someone who bought high, sold low?)
I had a blast wearing this costume! I'll post a few pics I've got of myself in it once I'm home and have a moment to sort through my camera.

Not much memes and entertainment during a market crash.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:59:59
My analysis is that between now and mid April, the highest price we'll see is 8k and the low will likely be the much-anticipated double bottom of the Feb 6 low at 5.9k. After that, we'll finally shoot up hard and fast through the downtrend resistance line from 19k and hit 9.5k. This will mark the end of the miserable bear market.

I use breadwallet and was going to try the new buy feature, but it requires you to enter your bank user name and password. No way would I enter that info.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:14:44
Yeah that was a little odd that we got bad news after bad news after bad news and then *poof*. I tend to think, though, that it's really just market sentiment that determines whether news impacts as OMG BAD NEWS SELL! SELL! vs  *Whatevs, I'm still buying.* There's been a rumor since last night that Binance was hacked and it didn't seem to have any impact at all. A few days ago, a rumor like that probably would driven the price down $2000. When people are nervous, they react differently than when they're relatively calm.

GDAX. There are no fees for buying and selling when you do a limit/maker order. It's also free to transfer your btc out of GDAX to your wallet or another exchange (they pay the transfer fee).

I thought the idea of a deflationary, decentralized digital currency was pretty cool and was the beginning of the next era of money. Then I saw how expensive it was (and was continuing to go up), so I figured if I wanted to buy some, sooner was better than later. I made incremental buys over the course of several weeks last fall (which turned out to be the worst possible time to buy bitcoin. At that time, I wasn't thinking about it as an asset for trading, but rather a future currency that was still finding its value. Now I know better -- that it's an asset for trading and has all the volatility, bubbles and crashes of any speculative market. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:38:36

Unless we're in the middle of a bull run! I dollar cost averaged from last October thru last December. I would've been *much* better off had I put all my money in at the first price point in October.

Support levels are prices that have held before (strong support would be prices that got hit several times and held). Resistance is the opposite -- they're price levels that bitcoin tries to get through and can't (or climbs above briefly before falling back down).
