Thats not exactly a new idea.
If I am not completely mistaken, rich people are able to gain residence permits in Canada if they are agree to invest certain sum of money. For example buying an expensive house. This is why the housing prices in Toronto have sky rocketed, as rich foreigners keep buying all the apartments, but dont actually live there.
Also if you are wealthy person, you will find it  a lot easier to get a green card in to USA, then if you are for example a dirt poor peasant from some third world country.

The lawyer later explained her "About 1 year statement or more" statement. It was never meant to be in anyway shape or form a accurate time table, an more of a vague "I really don't know how long it might take, please dont get your hopes up until I have more information".

The idea of "Recruit X number of people, and you get a % of their profits" is a common element in most pyramid schemes.
It is something that looks like logical and perhaps even a good idea, but in reality it quickly falls apart, due to the simple fact that it requires impossible number of people to join the pyramid.

He is specifically talking about the "True Believers". The fundamentalists. You know, those who reject any and all criticism of Bitcoin, who believe that there are sinister plots by The Establishment to destroy Bitcoin.
Basically the wankers who are so Enlightened By Their Own Intellect that they have poured their life savings in to Bitcoin and when they cant spin bad news in to Good News, they resort to repeating old sayings ("Blood on the street...", "First they ignore you" etc etc).

Oh Coindesk, you were so close, yet still so far.
Scandinavia refers to Norway, Denmark and Sweden This is because those 3 countries have shared history / language / culture. It is a term which specifically excludes Finland, so proper term for the article would be Nordic country.

Sorry about the nitpick.

Believe it or not but when person commits credit card fraud, the cops tend to have **a legal duty to investigate**, and you cant just "press charges" if they have a god damn valid warrant.


As a matter of fact it is, if the police have a reason to believe that he knew the credit cards were stolen, and still used them to buy stuff then yes he does "have a problem". The law is pretty clear on this.


Oh for love of.... This doesnt even deserve a response.

Well yes there are.
In short, America has massicely increased its oil production in few years. We are talking of multi billion dollar investments.
The problem is, it is expensive to produce oil in USA. The price needs to be 60 - 70 dollars per barrel just so American companies dont lose money. In future the cost could be lowered if tech improves enough.
The USA oil industry is serious threat and a competitor to Saudi-Arabia.
On the otherhand, it costs 14 - 20 dollars per barrel for Saudi-Arabia to make profit.
Saudi-Arabia is refusing to cut down the oil production so they can crush the USA firms.

Your article is intentionally misleading.
Ross is facing 2 trials. One in New York and one in Maryland. This is a widely reported fact.
New York trial focuses on drugs and money charges and Maryland trial is focused on murder-for-hire charges.
This is also another widely reported fact.
According to your article, because is not charged with murder charges in his upcoming trial (**IN NEW YORK**), that means that the charges have been "dropped".
This is false. Because he is still being charged in **MARYLAND**
 I dont understand why this is so confusing to so many people. Literally every article that I have read has specifically said that there are 2 different trials, each focusing on different crimes.

Imagine it this way. This is not a perfect example and english is not my first language, but I hope you understand what I am trying to say.
Person (lets call him Ross) claims that he does not own a car. There is a car sitting right outside of his house, and his neighbors have seen him driving the car everyday to work and back, but Ross claims to know nothing about this car.
Because Ross does not own a car, he does not have to pay car insurance, incase of accident / theft.
One day evil thiefs steal the car.
Following the theft, Ross calls the insurance company and demands that they pay him money, because the car is stolen.
Ross still refuses to claim responsibility for the ownership of the car, he publicly states that he has never owned a car in his life, yet still wants the insurance money for the missing car. 
Should the insurance company pay Ross ?. Is Ross really victim of a theft, when according to him it was not his car which was stolen ?

That is not what Benjamin Franklin said, and you have completely missed his rather important point.
The complete quote is:


I have bolded the important parts of the quote. In order for this quote to make sense, lets give some context:
When Mr.Franklin said this quote, he wasn't talking about general "muh American  Freedoms !".
In 1755 there was a power struggle between the state assembly of Pennsylvania and the Governor of the state.
The assembly wanted to raise taxes, so the state could properly fund a militia and defend the frontier against Indian / French attacks.
The Governor opposed raising taxes, because that would mean that the extremely rich Penn family ( who owned most of the state and the governor ) would have to pay their fair share.
Instead of paying taxes, the Penn family proposed "lets not raise taxes, let our family to raise our own private militia that we will use to protect the whole state. We promise. For reals "
Mr. Franklin sided with the assembly, because in his view the **states right to raise taxes** in order to have a proper, well funded militia ( **essential liberty** ) is more important then allowing some private citizens to refuse to pay taxes and instead to have their own private militia that would be supposedly used to protect the whole state ( **temporary safety** )
So yeh, your whole quote is about how important it is for the State to have the right to raise taxes if its needed.
Also I think its bit silly to use (completely butchered) words of a 18th century man to support your 21st century political ideals.

Also according to your website, Franklin said his famous quote in 1775. Unfortunately Wittes has traced its origins to 1755.

Force did in fact communicate with the agent in charge of investigation in New York. 
The agent in New York was certain that Force was attempting to sabotage his (New York) investigation, made a official complaint against him and urged his (Force's) superiors in Baltimore to investigate him.
It was that complaint that started the investigation, which eventually led to the arrest of 2 corrupt agents.
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:29:11


The lead agent did in fact know the two corrupt agents. Because he suspected that the two (or just the one) agents were intentionally trying to sabotage his investigation, and he made a official complaint and urged the other agency to investigate them. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:54:19

They admitted that he started the Silk Road but after couple of months left it because it was too stressful.
They then brought in his friend who testified how Ross had told them how he quit Silk Road after 2 - 3 months.
And after that prosecutor read part of his personal diary that basically said " Today I lied to my friends that I am no longer involved with Silk Road. The fools believed me. Haa haa".
It was quite brutal.
