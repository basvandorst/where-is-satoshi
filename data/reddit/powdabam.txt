Anyone want to explain this tech?  What prevents me from recording and replaying someone's wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:29:26
This is why the new irs rule is unenforceable.   Recording the value of your mined bits at every given point is impossible.

Send me a link to this program that  calculates all this automatically so I can fire my cpa, I want my 4 Grand filing fee back.  As far as your 2nd grade comment, I'm not referring to the math at all, I'm referring to the amount of math.... I'm sure in second grade your treacher never gave you homework with a million equations to solve.  Since you are suggesting I file my taxes correctly this year, show me the tool that is going to go back and solve the trillions of taxable events I had last year and stop being an ass hole while you're at it, have a little civility.  Before you muster another ass hat remark to save your internet pride... go read what I originally wrote and then your responses.  I clearly am concerned about the false tax I filed that needs to be resubmitted by next week.

7 is used through out the Bible and represents God.  6 represents man.  3 is also a number used to represent a whole, thus the trinity.   777 is the trinity.   666 is man pretending to be God or "sitting on God's throne", as revelation puts it.   666 is the number of man just as revelation says aswell.   So 666 is just man thinking he sits on God's throne or rather he/they no longer need God.  The " sign" of the beast isn't a number, it's simple man rejecting God entirely.  We are making our way there :)

Apple's own technology recognizes blood flow so a severed finger wouldn't unlock the phone.  Bernie would need to be a walking man to work the wallet.

No panic at all.   No one in their right mind went to an exchange and created a taxable event because the irs told them they were already in a taxable event.   The irs news is more like, ok that sucks but im already stepping in the poop.

What is dumb is they want you to Report the value of the coins at the time you mined them. .. but coins are mined in fractions of a coin.   It would take ten lifetimes to keep track of a single mined coin since it's 8 decimals.   Imagine having to report the value of each dollar you earned this year but the value at the time of each earned dollar.  Its even more complicated as that since it's a fraction of those dollars. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:06:40
The fallacy in your logic is comparing btc to usd when btc is meant to be a world currency controlled by the people and usd is an american currency controlled by 1 government.  So unless the us has plans to give up control of thr usd to a world government then you are already supporting a currency doomed to be replaced.  See bitcoin didnt rise to 1200 out of speculation alone, it rose by oppressed people buying it up in hopes it would one day save them from their 1 government's currency.

Really?  I mine ltc which means I will be paying taxes on literally billions of small taxable events.  Assuming excel is this magical, who will decide the value at any given moment of my litecoin?  See we dont have to pay taxes on usd adjusted for inflation, but with a crypto measured by thousands of world currencies we do.

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:03:10
Since bitcoin is measured to the 8th decimal do we have to keep track of the coins as they come in fractions or is the irs only saying full coins?  Seems like an impossible law to follow.

This is a great concept that needs more support.  I split my coins into denominations and it would be nice to have a sum of those somewhere...like a bank.
@_date: 2014-02-02 07:34:27
People are spending bitcoin at places like overstock and tigerdirect. These companies immediately dump their btc back into the exchanges for usd. This will push up supply and only get worse as more companies jump in. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:32:43
I acknowledge it was over valued.
I remember as a child watching channel 5 news as they explained ehat email was and began to mock it.  I asked mymother about it and she explained that usps was the largest parcel service in the world and the US government would never allow it to be replaced.  I remember vividly the dotcom bubble and all the I told you sos.  I learned early in my years that old people, like yourself, are stubborn and to this day, many of them still dont own a pc or tablet or smart phone.  I wish you luck with your government controlled, single country currency.  My currency is only measured in usd in your country.  Bitcoin is here to stay, I just ask that you not be such a blockhead 5 years from now.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:22:35
Is it really cheating when the irs puts out an impossible rule to follow?  I have to figure out the value of all the coin I mined last year and coins are mined in 8 decimals.... that's millions of values I need to figure out. ..is literally impossible to compute in my lifetime let alone the next couple of weeks.

Well he obviously doesn't understand economics.  Competition will always produce better results than 1 object, forced or not.  Look at the stock market, it used to cost hundreds of dollars to trade large stocks, now its a few bucks thanks to competitive exchanges.  The usd is only the problem because government.  A one world currency only works if the people control it and even then, multiple currencies would be better.

Completely off topic but entire skyscrapers have burned to bones for days and not fallen...white smoke, caused when a fire is dwindling,...did not bring wtc 7 down.  A building collapsing perfectly into itself by fire would be the 1st, in a long history of skyscraper fires, to ever do so.

Yes but charts measure those events and those stats, if you think I'm implying an up and down line on a graph can control value you are wrong.   I'm simply stating the trend is up.

@_date: 2014-02-07 15:17:31
You know the usd didn't always exist.  It takes a community that accepts it and then that grows.  1st btc will be mass adopted as a median of transfer like Overstock and Tigerdirct have done.  Once enough companies people use it for a median, they will eventually use it as currency.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:25:28
Coins are mined in fractions, not full coins, so you'll be sitting with the irs for a while to figure out the value of every decimal at every given second.

In all honesty, you have no clue what you are talking about.  You could easily say the same thing when comparing USD to the Euro...or any other currency for that matter.

LTC actually has a lot to offer BTC, you should jump off your high horse and look into it a little deeper.  That fact alone that it's a hedge against BTC, improves the currency as a whole.
