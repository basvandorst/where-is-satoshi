correct the news we get through main stream media television channels has never been so bad or this un-reliable.

YES! GE is in debt, but that's not a problem when you own the company (Synchrony Financial) that issued the debt. In fact, that's how you print money... but that's a whole different story. 
Point is, the best way to buy bitcoin at a MASSIVE discount is to have a "failing" company buy it for you first. BTC's price has already capitulated for this market current cycle, but GE's stock price has not. Once it does, Berkshire is going to swoop in and grab up a large amount of preferred stock similar to their APPL holdings. This will allow them to see profits off of their crypto bag in the future without ever having to sell. 
Anybody paying attention would know that CNBC has bashed GE &amp; BTC at almost the same rate over the past year.

How can he say all bulls are bearish when he's obviously still bullish?

I actually don't. I'm just stating 'what if' for those that do to help them understand that satoshi owning a portion of btc is pro and not a con in my opinion.

No, Why would you say that?

I wouldn't call myself an OG cause I jumped in during the last correction and therefore never truly felt the impact of that anger / depression market psychology cycle. I do remember the day bitcoin dropped below $200 down from 1.2K during the last correction tho . I had probably been invested for about 4 months prior to that and even at that time I knew that the chances of me getting that steep of a discount again would be slim. In my head I thought that this price made absolutely no sense.
This time around when the price fell violently from 6k to 3k I almost felt the same way but in my gut i still knew it was justifiable. Yes, I felt anger and currently a whole lot of depression,  but it was more so because I felt as if I had suddenly been exposed and humbled lol. All the technical analysis bullshit and HODL optimism I had been preaching to my friends for the last 8 months had just shown it's true value out in the open for us all to see.. which is damn near worthless. This makes sense to me because I'm sure thats the same amount of exposure and humility that most of these ICOs needed to feel in order for the bad projects to be weeded out. 
I'm still waiting until the time where the price doesn't make sense to me. I don't know what that price will end up being given I don't know what the overall financial climate will be in the near-future. We're in some pretty crazy times bro. I can say that if the price dropped below $2.5k today - the price would no longer make sense in my head. YES I would be even more depressed and angry, but I would also be calling everyone I know and trying my best to get them to invest even the slightest bit of their savings RIGHT NOW at this very moment.
