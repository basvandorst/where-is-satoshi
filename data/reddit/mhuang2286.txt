There is so much wrong in your posts I don't even know where to begin. Many Bitcoin full nodes exist solely for the purpose of relaying blocks and transactions without the wallet even enabled. Having these Bitcoin full nodes in data centers with 1/10/100GigE  pipes and direct peering to tier 1 bandwidth providers, internet exchanges, and dark fiber is essential to the backbone of the Bitcoin network and prevention of threats like DDoS attacks. If every bitcoin node was run on a personal laptop hooked up to a residential Comcast line, the network would be shit. See things like this:  Also even with the wallet enabled, I'd argue that a data center with physical security, biometric access, N+1 redundancy, fire suppression, etc.. is more secure than the average person's home. And if you're really paranoid and don't trust the hosting provider just encrypt everything and backup the private keys. But if the US government trusts AWS and the millions of customers that use DO, Linode, Ramnode etc without any problem, I think you'll be just fine.

It’s not the volatility it’s the huge exchange rate per coin and therefore huge fees

The api is so laggy and shitty though. It has like a 75% uptime and most of my requests timeout to it after 15 seconds.

Why are you two so quick to hate on a company simply because they are related to a bank? I would much rather have the option of having a VISA bitcoin debit card than not. And guess what, you need a bank to issue a debit card. And it's not like they're forcing you to buy their debit card... that is a decision for the consumer to make...
Coinbase has made it easy to buy and sell bitcoins in the US, created an easy-to-use online bitcoin wallet, created a bitcoin exchange, and its employees are actively involved in the bitcoin community... "I hate Coinbase with a passion" simply because there are some centralized elements of their business which **need** to be centralized in order to function just doesn't make sense to me.
If you want a company like Coinbase to be successful, the executives can't just be hiding in the corner away from big money screaming "muh decentralized cryptocurrency fuck banks fuck the u.s. dollar fuck visa ayy lmao"... that will get the bitcoin community nowhere.

lol Newegg is a multi-million dollar company... I doubt they will want to go through a tiny third party like Bitpay to process the huge amount of transactions they will be having. They will probably design their own in house bitcoin payment system. I'm sure they have the money for it.
Bitpay is great for small/medium businesses but when it comes to the scale of Newegg or Amazon it just won't cut it. And the entire point of bitcoin is to not have to go through a third party to get your money. I'm sure big retailers will want to take advantage of that and have control of the bitcoin directly.

I think Amazon and other big retailers will adopt bitcoin once it becomes more stable. Right now I think it's still in the "testing" stage and everything is flying around.

Hosting is always going to rely on someone and EC2 will allow for on-demand scaling to user load. Bitcoin being decentralized has nothing to do with this.

I would be able to do it for you if you trust me. 
I've been a redditor for a while, have a verified paypal and ebay, etc. 
Note that Paypal is reversible and I could screw you if I wanted to, but I wouldn't waste my time charging back to get $20.
If you're interested PM me.

I'm predicting either an instant 50% jump or 50% crash. May the odds be ever in your favor.

Things to never say in 1. Bitcoin is crashing
2. Bitcoin is going down
3. 1 and 2
