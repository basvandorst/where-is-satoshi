Fucking ridiculous.

Jesus is a scam and he never ate a taco.

I'm curious how much *they* lost in this fiasco.

A politician that uses emotes? This is a man of our generation!

Probably, they'd just throw around 10 or 20 instead of 5000.

Is that why it's **MtG**ox?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:20:40
Yessssssss, not it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:58:05
In my defense I knew it started as an MtG site, but I *am* the last person to see the significance in the name.

Does it grow on its own?

He clearly owns a few coins himself.

It's only safer from a logging perspective. If a web server has an access log, the query parameters will be logged along with the document that was requested. Not so with POST.

Don't think there is such a thing as insider trading here, unfortunately.

I'd be more scared of someone listening in the middle than somebody using my computer. Not that either is good, but I feel that given these two evils, I'd take passwords in a URL over no HTTPS.

I was going to for financial advice, but it seemed a bit far-fetched. This is perfect for me!

You should applaud yourself for only dropping 1% instead of half.

10 cents now could be much more in a few months time.

That actually exists?

Soooooo... I was just adding to your message. All I'm saying is that it sucks that we can't throw this person in jail, assuming they did something wrong. I'm not claiming that he's acting righteously or something, or that everyone should do this because it's legally allowed.
