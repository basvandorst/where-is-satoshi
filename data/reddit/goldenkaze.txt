Cmom, you should know by now that a 100trillion dollar is worthless, it's what you can buy with it that matters. Who cares if you make $10K a year, if you can buy a home for $15K?

Not even God himself could stop FDR from destroying the US economy.

People recognize that something like $BYND which went up 50% in a day could easily collapse, but when bitcoinn does it, it's because of solid fundamentals. If it goes up easy, it can collapse just as fast.

Bitcoin and Fiat dollars are the same, they both do not have a store of value. 
You have to have faith!!!

Isn't the reason to buy Bitcoin because the government can't manipulate it?
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:15:57
A major reason was the US government lied (gasp) about their gold reserves and the French called their bluff.  But even then, a loaf of bread costs about exactly the same in terms of gold as did other commodities which are similarly priced. And of course capitalism by design is deflationary. 
The invisible hand of the free market always wins. 
It's a rock fact.

Inflation is so, so, so much worst when you fix for the fact that corporations and capitalism are inherintly DEFLATIONARY, despite this they *still* manage to raise the cost of living by &gt;2% per year. The government, like any other parasite, will continue to suck the blood out of the host, until the host dies. Expecially if the host is too dumb to figure out that theyre being slowly killed, and let's be real the direction of the average voters thinking seems to reflect that based off recent political debates....
The average cost of home going from 3.5x the median salary to 6x the median salary despite of deflation by capitalism is terrifying and homes are more luxurious than ever.

There was a guy who knew of silver price manipulation by Futures markets that predicted the closing price of silver for several weeks. He used it as evidence and got the banks fined.

Because he'd be searching for Satoshi in Japan when we all know he's actually a britbong.

Because BTC is transferable in any currency, people can sell their Argentina Bitcoin for USD or Yen

How did Chinese people Ponzi scheme 200K worth of bitcoins?

Gold &amp; Silver are in a bull market with strong buy the dip support. Bitcoin has been sliding.

"cyber gold", cyber gold is tanking when the 2-10 inverted!!!

Why are gold &amp; silver continue to punch up but Bitcoin keeps sliding?
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:31:01
Gold has made all time highs this year in cad, euro, yen, aud, only the USD is being stubborn. That's mostly because only USD pays a decent yield. Lots of inflow of USD into assets.

But if you invest your rent money wisely, you just paidna years worth of rent.

I ask again, why does gold &amp; silver go up in the perfect environment to bet against fist as we are in the perfect storm, but Bitcoin keeps selling off!
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:23:47
Because no one believes in Bitcoin, the current rise is due to no one selling their Bitcoin, everyone is buying and holding with the expectations it goes up again. That's when all of you hogs are gonna get slaughtered. Congratulations on buying some bits though, real smart investment in the "the greater fool" economy!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:43:26
Gold is going parabolic as of late
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:20:34
If it's a store of value, why does the price fluctuate so much? 
Art at least is real, Bitcoin is just a bunch of bits on a hard drive. 
You Bitcoin bugs will find out the hard way that in a get rich scheme, the people that got rich already took off like bandits with you holding the bags!!!

Bits have no use, at least I can jerk off to some ancient Greek statues.
