Yup, I paid the other day a new house with the doubloons that my grandpa left me. I believe one of my ancestors was a pirate. So happy gold is still accepted by real state agents!!

All those companies founded since his mate died and he got hold of the stash... If you look at what they say he spent on the companies and computers and divide by the price of bitcoin when they were founded you get ~ 700k coins...
I'm willing to bet he sold the coins "off the chain" with a private contract and used the money. No wonder the tax agency wants to have a world with the guy.

Do you have reasonable assumptions about the difficulty increase?
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:44:08
I posted this [elsewhere]( maybe it's wrong though:
After ~ 4 (=log(1.2)/log(0.86 * 4)) EDAs, such base difficulty will equalize profitability at current exchange rates, and one EDA won't cut it. This will probably take ~ 10 days. Once it happens 2 EDAs in a row will make BCH block frequency 4 times faster than the current rate of ~35 blocks per hour, effectively beggining BCH's exponential spiral towards low difficulty and increasing inflation. A halvening will happen much sooner than expected, speeding up the spiral. Perhaps instead, after 4 or 5 such double EDAs miners will have to switch so quick from BTC to BCH and vice-versa that maybe things will equilibrate.

Further explanation:
Yes, bcash now oscillates between an upper and lower difficulties, the EDA lowers the upper difficulty by 20%, and miners trigger it in a sequence of 6 in a row, so that lowers the upper difficulty to 0.8^6 = 0.262144. On the other hand, blocks are mined very quickly for any given 2016 block adjustment period, which increases the difficulty by the maximum possible in a period (4x). Now 0.8^6 * 4 = 1.048576, almost 1 but not quite, so after several of these cycles, the upper and lower difficulties will drift upwards. These cycles would last around 3 days (first one was longer but they will shorten eventually as miners get more efficient at shifting between chains).
Assuming (big if), that price ratio stays more or less constant, there is now around 1.2 advantage to mine BCH in the lower difficulty phase. When the 1.2 hits 1 (probably earlier), due to the overall difficulty increase, not even the lower difficulty will cut it and miners will trigger a second difficulty adjustment on top of the current one, lowering the difficulty by ~16x over the higher one of the time. This will accelerate even further the block frequency (making the halvening come even faster) and lower the period of difficulty fluctuations by 4. If this happens, I expect the BCH price to plummet and make this a non-issue by then.

Actually I believe it was Sergio Demian Lerner et al who found ASICBOOST. Bitmain patented it first for China (I guess copied the original patent). So not even that.

I was thinking that this may be the endgame of this attack, to achive a flippening in time for Coinbase's listing of BCH (first exposure to the masses) in January.
