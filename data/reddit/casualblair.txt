I agree, but the point I was trying to make is that all currencies have the same basic problems inherent in value: fluctuation. People seem to think bitcoin is immune to inflation because there is no supply problems but they ignore lack of supply problems and fluctuating demand problems. All currencies experience this, whether gold or seashells. To call bitcoin immune is naive at best.

Money is a measure of value.
Value is a human perception of worth that varies by individual and society.
The price of bitcoin is a measurement of its value.  
Ergo, bitcoin is subject to the same forces all currencies are.
The amount of people who run their mouths about bitcoin being immune to inflation or deflation is impressively bad.  This is what I'm referencing.  Inflation is not just supply, but also demand.  People seem to skip this.
Thus I was impressed to see someone talking about value in .  It seems rare.

Never expected to see this comment in The amount of people preaching the currency with no idea about how value works is mind boggling.

It's not.
When society shuts down because no one has anything they need from work to food to electricity, what use is money? I give someone my money but they can't do anything with it because they can't get what they need either. If I give the electrical company money but get no electricity, it's useless. If they try to hire people to fix electrical problems but these people can't use it to buy anything, it's useless. If the ports all shut down and there is no stream of food or other supplies, then there is literally nothing to buy.
Money has value when we say it does my mutual agreement. If you can't trade time for food because there is no food, why bother monetizing time?
