Ok, this is my time to shine.
I wrote a book about physical bitcoins, to which Coblee actually contributed some images. 
I'm shocked that there are this many of these gold coins; as far as I knew previously (and is stated in the book), total mintage was below than 10.
The book is almost 300 pages, and 1/3rd is available as a free eBook on my site at 
You can also see the book on Amazon:
Don't underestimate the significance of physical bitcoin; its a great bridge to help others understand cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-01-04 06:30:47
Yes, I'd agree that it's a well established word and concept by now..
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:35:32
Im with ya :)
that said.. i like the idea of having a honey badger on a physical bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-04 06:45:39
It wont come cheap, but they exist.
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:01:17
Depends on condition. Maybe 1.5 BTC
check out  for detailed info about he coin!
@_date: 2016-12-27 07:27:48
It is a guarantee.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:13:42
Is this something you are producing in quantity?
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:43:11
It certainly would, but it becomes a matter of scale. very difficult to coordinate 30 color books and 50 B&amp;W books. I do intend to make the ebook available for a lower price on Amazon, however.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:24:41
The pre-order would be a paperback (perfect bind). The reason for the high-ish price is two-fold:
1. This will be a color book. 200 pages of color photos
2. very small print amount; likely under 50
@_date: 2015-07-19 21:13:46
While I appreciate the watchfulness of the community, I am a very reputable individual. See the book order thread at

@_date: 2017-05-27 01:24:26
Perhaps, it will also cause the physical bitcoin community to grow!
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:32:53
it depends, but you should be able to get a brass 1btc coin for 1.8-2 BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:30:19
I answered this elsewhere on the thread. they are called 'double errors' and only 5 were made.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:03:05
Not necessarily doubles, but they do have a premium attached. some might add 20%-50%, while a rare one is 20x the value of the bitcoin inside.

If you give me your stuff in a situation where a reasonable person would expect me to return it to you upon your request, you would still own it.
When you put something in an exchange, are you gifting that money to them? The exchange provides a service for which it charges a fee, and it is implied that you can deposit and withdraw at will. The user owns the bitcoins and the law supports that. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:16:52
Please, stop with the BS. Bitcoin is getting a larger user-base, and 99% of people don't think like that.
If I give you my car, a bar of gold, or a $100 bill with the reasonable understanding that you are only holding it for me and will give it back to me when I ask, then I still own it 100%.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:32:14
Fortunately, those have not shown up yet. When they do, chains of ownership will be important. I imagine that I will be offering verification/certification services in the future via 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:46:14
I refer to a coin known as the 'double error', of which only 5 exist. 2 have been 'found' and 3 are still out there (it is statistically reasonable that one of them has been redeemed).
Check out the free ebook on  there is tons of info there!
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:51:22
The way I see it, Casascius coins (and other physical crypto-coins) will almost certainly keep significant value, even if the underlying currency were to fail. They are a relic of the early days of crypto-currency, and I believe they will be valued for a long time.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:22:56
Looks familiar ;)  
I feel the public would more like the coin representation of this image:

This page explains it:

@_date: 2017-05-24 12:09:21
I'd be interested to learn about what you saw.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:49:47
You sure about that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:34:48
I dont have a specific chronological timeline, but my book mentions the dates that most mints began operations.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:18:05
We need symbols. The symbol of'btcoin' is a digitized coin with a 'B'. The closest physical equivelant of that is a Casascius coin, r a gold-colored coin with a B. Similar things are true for other crypto-currencies.
Also, physical coins holding digital curencies (or atleast themed after them) will not go away. On the contrary, they will become more an more popular. I await the day that some country's mint strikes a coin that has some mention or reference to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:48:35
There are actually over 50 manufacturers of 'physical bitcoins'
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:59:41
The premiums are about 1.2x on the VERY low end, while 2x or even 3x are possible with 1btc coins. 0.1's go for about 10x, while a 25 BTC coin might net you a 2-3btc premium. If you happen to have a very rare 1btc coin, it could sell for 20 BTC!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:23:58
Actually, his face already is on some! ;)
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:55:20
Correct. There are a few different types. Wit htheearliest Casascius coins, there is no window, only the first-bits are printed onto the hologram. There are ofcourse hundreds of other coins not made by casascius
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:02:13
They sell now and then. Expect a 2-3 BTC premium. I do broker sales.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:19:26
I wrote a book about them
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:08:18
On the contrary, I believe physical bitcoins are the easiest, most tangible way to introduce someone to Bitcoin. Not everyone is technically minded enough to grasp a concept like bitcoin without 'help'. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:57:52
If you have kept the peeled hologram, it is worth more. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:56:07
About 52,000 BTC is stored in Casascius coins
@_date: 2016-07-09 11:29:54
Thankyou, I really hope that is the case. The book has plenty of history about crypto-currencies, which is often reflected in the physical coins along with the ideologies, views, and 'culture' relating to the rise of crypto-currency.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:05:56
"Physical crypto-currency is worthy of study because it is evidence of the notable technological and social progress relating to the continued development of a new system of value. The concept of a digital currency that is based on mathematical principles is simply revolutionary, and will in one way or another eventually reshape the world and society in which we live.
These coins are the artifacts of that future."
I've been in touch with the curator there by the way, great guy!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:28:54
Thanks for your support! I bet you will love it!
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:23:45
Are you active on the forums? I'm going to assume that we already know each other, and you are aware of my work with 
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:12:48
It's not the most efficient setup, but basically a potential buyer would email me as instructed, and I would then act as a middleman to arrange shipment of the coin from the owner to the buyer. The main difference between those with a price and those without is that there is no negotiation process for a coin that already has a listed price.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:33:39
I try to share my work as much as I can ;)
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:26:28
I know someone willing to sell the 1000 coin, 1000 bar, and at least an unfunded 500 bar.
