Relevant: 
With open-source development, the developer is able to create apps and content from an unsecured personal computer. Worst case scenario, Coinbase users are nervous that the unofficial app could potentially allow their personal information to be stolen or lost. Some even fear that Vilcsak himself may try to steal their information; however, there are no indicators to support the theory.

Also, what no one else has said, please unload your Walther. Hang on to your BTC for 24hr. The price you bought for will hit again in the next 24 hrs. If you're not feeling great about it, cash out 40-90% and let the rest sit for a year. You'll either be rich or lose half what you left in, but you'll be alive. The world keeps spinning friend.

I bought in at 700 and felt dumb because there I was, in that moment, paying the most anyone was willing to pay for BTC. 
I didn't want to buy in at 700, but I wanted to buy in,  in the long run, there's not going to be much of a difference between buying in at 700 and in at 1000, good or bad.

Regardless on how you feel about this, give the guy an upvote for the thread, this is his chance to get resolution. He'd probably be a guy that would give an upvote if someone else here made a plea thread. 
Also, my vote is to email them and ask what it will cost to get your coins back. More than likely they want to make sure all funds collected currently clear through before determining what bitcoins you get back. Bad thing for you at the moment is that bitcoin is down so you're going to get less BTC back. 
Last thing, I'm not a financial advisor or guru, but I am in the banking/financial industry, and if you're over drafting your MAIN checking account you might want to reevaluate what portion of your money you're putting into BTC. 
Either way, good luck getting your coins back.

I think lending could be successful with bitcoin if lenders are made up of pools of people with similar risk aversion.
 It could be like a kickstarter page, a farmer in need of supplies could request a BTC loan, he'd post his need, expected return, collateral (if any), and investors expected return. A group of individuals with similar risk aversion will back a borrower, the larger the pool, the smaller amount to chip in and the more even the spread of risk.

@_date: 2013-11-23 22:44:33
No I don't want it. 
If it is to be a viable currency then BTC must be used at the Sotoshi level, if they are used at the Sotoshi level those with a large number of BTC will be very influential. I wouldn't have it any other way though, at some level of wealth there will always be those with vast quantities. I would rather those in control have been early adopters who understand BTC and its intricacies instead of an organization operating for a profit.

I just bought from coinbase, my justification is that I'm paying a convenience fee for being able to ach my BTC. I looked at mtgox and localbitcoins and their prices are more in line with coinbase.

The assumption is that each wallet is used one time. You wouldn't do a "withdrawal" from your offline wallet, you'd create a new offline wallet and transfer whatever BTC's there that you hadn't transferred to the USB.

As soon as someone figures out how to move small transactions (.20¢- $10) to new users in an easy way (no bank verification or hoops to jump through) that person is going to be filthy rich. 
There needs to be a tool that will allow the average person to purchase a fraction of a bit coin by sending a text. The charge for the BTC would just show up on your phone bill. 
There needs to be a push for "short term BTC" funds that can be reloaded with a text or a transfer or something, and then a "long term BTC" wallet that is much more secured.

What part are you at? Bank account verification? If so, you'll have to skip the instant verification and do it the old school way - two deposits will hit your account for a few cents, then you have to go back into coinbase after the deposit and verify the amounts. I tried to verify instantly and was met with the inability to do so. So, I confirmed the deposits the next day, made a purchase of 1 BTC and am now waiting until Wednesday the 7th the receive my BTC in my coinbase wallet which will then be moved to an offline wallet. I am in the process of verifying my cc with them so that I can buy same day. My plan is to operate out of two wallets. An offline "savings account" and a "day to day" wallet that I will be refilling from coin base. 
Sorry to type all of that out, it actually helped me to lay it out and make sure I have my mind wrapped around what I'm trying to accomplish. Hopefully it helps someone else out, or someone can correct me if I'm doing something incorrectly.

Recently I've just been watching for gaps of 8% between markets and buying through coinbase, I know that this isn't related or a dependable way to invest. But, so far, as mtgox goes up, it pulls the other markets up with it. This will probably burn my ass, but it is working at the moment(probably just because BTC is going up in general)

It may be an honest look for a way to experience BTC. I was in essentially the same spot a couple days ago. I don't think that we (I say "we" in a way to encompass all of us who have been in the game for a week or less), I don't think "we" would really baulk at the idea of spending 5 or 10 dollars to experience BTC. 
A perfect set up would be to have a group of "power users" in the side bar who are willing to sell 5-7$ worth of BTC for a $10 PayPal transfer.

I feel like this is too scripted. The conspiracy theorist in me doesn't want to believe that a government somewhere didn't have something to do with BTC. It's the perfect move for a government in a state of financial hurt to replace its currency without it being "their fault". 
 "are you disappointed in the government? Buy bitcoin". 
90% of people are disappointed in government. It should have pretty wide adoption. 
Either way, Bitcoin will raise in value. Either it isn't a government system and will flourish in freedom, or it is a government system and it will flourish whether it wants to or not, with media manipulation if needed.  To the moon! (Holy shit, another moon conspiracy)

I know you got fucked, but those 12.7btc are going to be just as valuable as 13btc one year from now, if their worth a ton, congrats, if their worth somewhere south of where its value is now than it really is only a swing of 250ish dollars. This early in the trade game, and this early in the chaos of BTC, you'll end up with nearly the same results. 
Last thing and ill be done giving my 2¢, it will all even out in the long run. 
Good luck and here's and upvote for visibility.

i just read the reviews for coinjar, one mentioned that coinjar stole from a cutomer and to google:

Those of us with a few extra bucks owe it to the community to help those interested find the path of BTC in an organic way. Lets spread the seeds. $.25 goes a really long way, never before has such as small amount of money been responsible for sending someone on a quest for knowledge.
edit: also sorry for the video as the topic, not in this for karma (as evident by my 1 karma total :)), but the video really does help explain a lot! off to try to give my first bitcointip

I'm not the authority on this, but I'll try to regurgitate what I've learned in a few days. 
Find a machine you are 100% certain is uninfected with any spyware malware. (Not 99%). If that means wiping an old computer and reinstalling os or Ubuntu or Linux (I'm unfamiliar with Ubuntu and Linux) then do that. Go to bitaddress and save the page (right, the whole page) to a thumb drive. Turn on your newly cleaned computer, boot it to what ever os you are using, open your thumb drive, (during this whole process make sure you stay offline, no wireless or anything). Generate a wallet from bit address( you can a lot of them so you don't have to replicate this process every time you want a cold wallet. Now, print to a printer that is not part of a network. Those pieces of paper you've printed have now only been seen by you. Take the public part of the wallet, send a test payment to it, view it in block chain from a live computer. If you are the deposit in the blockchain address you know that it works. Now, figure out the best way to protect the private key that only your eyes have seen. You can put it in a safe deposit box, cut it in half and store it in different locations, etc. 
But, remember, this is like cash buried in a field. If you die or become incapacitated your money will remain buried. Make sure you have a back up in place, give a family member a key to the safe deposit box (also, remember to chose someone who will know what to do if the find tour key. Don't chose someone that's just sees a random string of digits and throws them away. Have instructions on what it is and how it works. 
Good luck! Have fun!

You have two options now that's it's done, dwell on it and make yourself sick, or move on, pick and choose your financial priorities very carefully over the next couple years and build your balance back up in your savings account. A lot of people start over with much less and they're able to do it, you can too!
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:44:39
Not only that, but if you can do it on a credit card with points back, you are making money while you exploit the point system.

As you pull your BTC back into cold storage, someone else just bought their first fraction of one.  Crazy how you're both in such different places in the process. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:49:03
also, i checked out that other thread you were posting in, and i think that the user who mentioned that it could be legit and a great marketing/PR move for a new company that is dealing in BTC and gambling on it continuing to rise, take a loss now, make it up on the backside multiple times over. This could be a new strategy that aggressive merchants might start to market to the btc demo.

It was a tongue and cheek comment, but my point was to highlight the benefits of an unregulated currency. The majority of users wont be silkroadies, and comments like mine wont become the common BTC consensus. I made a blanket statement, but it was to draw importance to the independence of the currency, that with BTC in an unregulated environment allows everyone to operate on their own level of morality, the government has less of a chance to step in and make decisions about how your money is spent. 
In the big picture, i think your comment makes sense, but i think that the push away from silk road and BTC for drugs has already happened and are now the minority transactions. I dont see BTC regressing into a black market currency (i could be 100% wrong), but with the adoption into the media and masses, I think BTC is on the cusp of legitimacy.

I guess my argument is that the adoption of bitcoins into more of a main stream currency could have a positive effect on LTC induction into the market. 
What I'm speculating is that BTC will be a wealth vehicle, while LTC will be the day to day crypto for the everyday person. I know that I've missed the boat on profiting on BTC, I don't expect LTC to grow like BTC has, but if I'm in a position to be an early adopter of LTC than I might as well try!

If you still have your personal key you can find your wallet backwards at bitaddress. (Sorry, I may be confused with what you're asking, you may have lost your front end client on android, but as long as you have your passkey somewhere you'll be able to find your wallet, you can import your key to coinbase    
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:20:41
Right, it's a powerful tool. So why, or how, would some other crypto fix something that's not broken? 
You're asking if people will move away from it, but why would they? Because its popular? That would be the reason to continue using it, because it is working. 
Edit: sorry! I was not seeing it as such an uneven distribution of world wealth. I was reading it as relative wealth to other BTC holders. My bad!!

Right, but when their wallets contain 1000's of BTC, and the world is operating at a Sotoshi level, when further coins are needed (as demand increases) the biggest of the share holds will sell their coins off. They are the supply, and when demand dictates more coins needed, those with the most BTC will sell further coins into the market. Market corrections have to happen organically. The deeper and deeper the BTC get divided the more and more influential power those with an excess will be able to exercise. The largest accounts will be able to change market value if they decided to make large movements after the BTC market is stabilized. Basically, future movement of bitcoin will be determined after bitcoin is stripped down to an 8 decimal medium of exchange.

"Everyone...getting on the bitcoin bandwagon".  (Sorry, I don't know how to quote on alienblue)
When you say everyone, remember what a small, small percentage that actually is, the people talking about it today are still early adopters. Bitcoin is still a baby on a world wide scale of "everyone".

Quick, what's the best way to get a bunch of people to buy into a new government facilitated paradigm shift? I'll give you a hint, it's not the way the new insurance market for the affordable care act was rolled out. 
Is it strange that there wasn't much said about BTC until the Feds had taken down SR and secured a good share of coins. The SR was beta testing for how legit BTC was. The group of people who are early adopters, and early users, not even the early speculators, but the early users are some pretty ingenious people. Why not let them be your lab rats for the BTC project. Those early adopters are probably 10-12 years ahead of the general public, that gives Gov more than enough of a head start.
