Ledger X’s only advantage is the mobile app. You're not tied to a computer. But yes, others are worth checking too.

Thanks Stormjib! It would be an option I guess

There’s no invoice with DropBit. You can send and receive sats using phone number or Twitter handle. I should’ve mentioned it in my post. I’ve got 100 sats in BlueWallet but can’t send them to myself because of it.

This video looks like sponsored by Visa, Master Card, or PayPal ��
But since February I’m only spending Bitcoin, and it’s near impossible right now to survive by paying only with Bitcoin!
I had to take unpaid leave, and since the beginning of the year (February) BTC is what I use to pay for bills, food, rent etc. NO, IT’S NOT POSSIBLE TO SURVIVE PAYING WITH BTC ONLY! Yes, caps. 
You constantly have to exchange into local currency, and it’s super expensive. The losses are approximately $1000 per BTC @ $9000 price. Every gift card you purchase will charge you fees. Small fees for BTC transactions but high fees for gift cards and such. If you ever find supermarket accepting BTC it will probably be luxury with ridiculous prices. Regular people can’t use it as they would use credit card. It’s inconvenient, very inconvenient. 
I tried cards like Revolut, Monese, and Transfer Wise to load with BTC. They will work if you’re in the same country, but if you’re traveling then your card will often be blocked. My job was travel related and I’ve done 20 locations/countries in the past two years, BTC payments during that time were 2 - 3 transactions every 6 months. That’s because few locations accepted BTC. 
So far the only use for me was transporting large amounts of money through the border without declaring it, sending money abroad (depending on the location and exchange rate), investing in Bitcoin, and making YouTube video about Bitcoin, which will bring you more revenue than the Bitcoins spend during the video!
I don’t care how many downvotes will this comment get, but no, it’s not possible to survive paying with Bitcoin only. It’s fucking annoying and pain in the ass!

Just received and sent back the sats. Thanks! ����

Thanks u/BashCo! Yes, it wouldn’t make sense asking Lightning or Bitcoin usernames questions there. 
Btw, one of the comments here said that I’m trolling. Since you’re one of the mods here, if you believe that, you can remove my initial question. Otherwise, just an average Joe here — some things I know, some things I don’t.

Wow, really extensive information! Thanks exab!
The only thing that surprised me here, is Vitalik Buterin being part of the Bcash community. Now it makes more sense now why Ethereum choose Bcash. And when they announced Ethereum 2.0 will be running on Bcash blockchain (I’m not familiar with all the terms, you get the idea), ETH price dropped maybe $50. I assume Ethereum investors are not very happy being connected to Bcash. 
I don’t think any of the two — Bcash or ETH stands any chance against Bitcoin. Every coin has some kind of control or monopoly, where Bitcoin is completely independent. At least this what it seems to me. 
Anyway, thanks again for the info.

Thanks! Exactly the info I was looking for.

Well done I guess. Will check the sub when I have more time, because the more replies on here, the more curious I get.
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:34:28
I will :) thanks
