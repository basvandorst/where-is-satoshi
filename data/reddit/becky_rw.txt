You didn't have $75 in a wallet.  You had some bits, that you had bought earlier.   You can trade those bits with someone else, anywhere else, and they can keep them, trade them, or turn them into whatever currency they happen to pay their taxes or suppliers in.   All for much, much less than what the banks charge to do it irreversibly, and much, much quicker.

I still don't get what's so horrible about a $1 fee for what the thing does.   Just driving to the grocery store costs about $3; sending a bank transfer overseas is much more expensive.    I know people have this weird notion of it being paypal 2.0 or a Credit/Debit card, but its just not.   
It is a really interesting way to hold value for diversification; its really cool for near-instantly sending several hundred/thousand bucks to someone else on the opposite side of the world with no chance of interference, reverse, or bank hold.
Buying a cup of coffee?  local fiat, its not evil, and is what the merchant has to pay their taxes in anyway.

Doesn't seem like an unreasonable statement of the situation.  
A path to consider, if hard fork is how it plays out.
BU becomes separate from BTC.   two chains split, segwit then adopts on the BTC chain, the BU large block adopts on the BU chain; and then the market decides the value of each.   
As long as Bob the User can safely go from 1 BTC(2016) to 1 BTC(segwit chain) + 1 BTC(unlimited chain); then all seems fair enough and well within the principle.

You shouldn't assume bitcoin is anonymous.  Its simply obfuscated at a fairly substantial level.   What it is though, is a method of transferring value that does not rely on 3rd party consent or trust at a reasonably low cost.

Treating a dangerous disease with an inexpensive, effective, and quite safe (as medical treatments go) therapy, is neither drastic nor radical.  Some of my trans friends object to the use of the word disease or mental illness, but I tend to think its fine.   I have diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, standard geezer diseases, I take a pill or shot, they cause minimal disruption to my day to day function.    Same deal here.
Also not knowing is VERY common in psych medicine; patients react differently to different psych medications and no one has the faintest idea why; some current medications don't even bother to attempt to find out why they work, "they just do... sometimes... maybe."   
Plastic surgery of various types are performed all the time with little controversy, and most pay themselves.   I see no difference with grs or surgery to remove gyno.  User should pay in full.
I'm a free market kind of person, so I'm sympathetic to your point.  You are deluded though if you think cost would ever discourage the step that bothers you most, HRT, because it is extremely cheap, and really requires no additional medical contact than what you'd normally do.  Endo's get involved because its easy and profitable; but nurse practitioner can prescribe this junk by eyeball with no significant risk.  Even the T level check is essentially routine for someone complaining about screwed up response to T type things.
Now, I have really bad news though; if you'll pause to think for a sec; if the US goes to an NHS type system, it will be the left that puts it in place; and when they do, they'll likely cover the whole array of transgender care, so not only will you get the privilege of paying for a bunch of bottom surgeries, you'll get to do it under threat of the IRS taking everything you own.   lol.   don't worry, they'll take a bunch of my money too...   This step is probably inevitable; you won't be able to do a thing about it.
Happiness, hmmm, I dunno.  Unless someone creates a drug that can rebuild that inner chunk of brain that reacts to sex hormones, the only way close to happy I can get is with an anti-androgen.  If I use an anti-androgen, I absolutely MUST use a substantial amount of estrogen; and thus, you have HRT.  Happiness seems vague and distant though;  so I settle for being content and peaceful; truly comfortable is my long term objective.    And HRT grants me that path for the first time in my quite long life.

Agreed; I don't see the big deal.   I've transferred USD from Scottrade to Coinbase, and from Chase to Coinbase; so the government folks already know everything on that form, and much more.

That is true; and its also something I don't support; it seems to me the fairest and safest approach is to start a blocker as soon as there's a problem.  (would have been age 5 for me, T activated ALL of the adult receptors in my head at that point, leading to, interesting effects that would be essentially illegal to describe, and were very unpleasant to experience); they can sit prepubescent till 18 and then make up their own mind.

That's NOT how it works.    What is true, is that they can not, under any circumstances, take a bitcoin you received in the wild that has gone through a gambling or drug site recently, and turn it into USD.     And to be honest, any US based exchange that does permit that activity is certain to have a fairly short lifespan, or be completely co-opted by federal investigative efforts, using it as a "ground truth" for inputs and outputs.

You're obsessed with wiki.   pubmed is better, but you gotta use it from a university library to get access to the full journal articles.
That said, I can explain a specific type of the intersex/transgender phenomenon.
During the brain's early development, the part that responds to sex hormones is laid down before the fetus produces much of anything.  Mom is supposed to figure out boy or girl, and if a boy, fire some T at the fetus to sensitize it a certain way so its compatible with normal male T levels.  This almost always works.   Almost.   Almost kinda sucks when you're the oops.    
By missing, you end up with a brain that's setup for female(default) levels and sensitivity to testosterone living in a body that produces 10 times as much.
All kinds of really gross and annoying mental health issues arise as a result, and they are all very, not fun, and not sympathetic.
But there's a simple, cheap, easy cure.  Works like a champ.   Turn off the T.  Add a little E to replace lost aromatase production so the bones don't fall apart and you don't get demntia, and you're golden.

@_date: 2016-11-03 13:06:28
I think you're reading China quite wrong here.   If I were to think the PRC party guys had interest one way or another in bitcoin; it would be that they want to prevent it from getting wrapped up into SWIFT style controls, where the Atlanticists can dictate who you're are allowed to do business with, and who you are not. 
Basically, on this point, I trust the PRC far, far more than I'd trust the US or UK.

No, they didn't report a $730 capital gain.  They reported paying you $730.   You have a matching inventory cost, or basis value, depending on how you report it.   Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = Income.  You pay tax on the $30.

Cute, you know a couple words, and have an erroneous understanding of what causes a penis to grow in the first place.  An expert in the making.    
You also do not know whether any particular body has XY in all cells or not.  It is sufficient to have gonadal production of testosterone; you can have a bucket ton of XX cells in your body and still have a penis and still produce adequate testosterone.
If humans were 100% XX or XY and always had matching hormonal exposure from mom in the womb; your world view would be somewhat more accurate.

As to docs, you are in error.  MOST of the time what you write is true.  Some of the time... well, not so much.   All kinds of crazy screw ups can happen between the fetus' genetics, and the mom's endocrine system.

The truth of the matter, HRT is dirt cheap.  Seriously.   In the US, you swap one blood pressure med for another one that is very cheap; you switch from watching sodium, to watching potassium, and you take estrogen which is maybe $4-$10 a week depending on form.   These drugs are cheaper than my copay.
And you seriously picked a plan based on HRT ???   Free market choice is an amazing thing.   I can see a plan barring the use of like Lupron for HRT because of its cost; but that's not generally what is prescribed in the US.

It read more like to me that they were getting the whole batch as opposed to specific individual details.   They should go after tax cheats, but I don't think that is the primary objective here.
Doing your transactions in bitcoin does not relieve you of your tax obligations, though it does make it substantially more complicated to comply with the tax code.    Its that last part I think they want to fix before bitcoin increases it penetration in US retail and individual transactions; like selling an old car for instance.    If you depreciated the car on your taxes that you bought in dollars and then sold it in bitcoin; the accounting is non-trivial.  
Basically, I think they are wanting to re-type it from an asset to a foreign currency, and then everyone just uses the existing foreign currency rules as is.    But they can't just do it because it sounds like a good idea.

I have bought some stuff, I don't know that it was NECESSARY to use bitcoin to do it, but I wanted to see how it worked in practice.  
To me it seems pretty cruddy for buying coffee at the shop down the street, but really pretty good for paying a non-USD, non-VISA/MC proprietor in any random country.  Fee is very low, guy doesn't have to trust that I'll rip him off with charge back later; transaction speed from my btc wallet to his local paper currency is VERY good.  Seems very well suited for purchasing stuff between $100 and $1000 value where its easy for the customer to trust the merchant, but hard for the merchant to trust the customer.   
I don't really care for gambling, casino style, so I'm not going to waste any value trying that out.  Same with the other "sinful" usages; but I can see how the trustless nature of the transaction does feed into that problem.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:23:53
So to buy one from each, you would have about $4 greater cost in using coinbase, but more assurance the KYC rules have been followed.    That doesn't seem like a sufficient difference to use the words "ripped off" to me...  And to be fair, circle's KYC adherence may be just as good, I dunno.     Seems like going ballistic over the difference between one brokerage that charges $7 a trade and one that charges $9 a trade.
Seems to me the hate towards coinbase has to be coming from an ideological perspective, not a value perspective.

That's good.  Sent a link to one.  If you're familiar with pubmed then you can stick "fetal development brain gender" in the search box as well as I can.

What they describe is not a bad thing per sea, its a feature of fiat currency; the dollar is meant to do that.    You don't want inflation TOO high of course, because then people can't receive X value and the spend X value soon after at near the same purchasing power.   But inflation MUST be positive for the fiat side economy to work properly.  Otherwise, the best investment becomes stick physical cash in a vault and guard it with a shotgun; thus collapsing GDP.
Bitcoin works more like gold or silver, an asset that you can't just arbitrarily change the amount in circulation, where small, predictable "mining" additions are added over time to the overall pool, so its value in purchasing power is vaguely known over long periods of time.  Bitcoin is better than gold or silver, in that you can put $100 worth of it in someone's pocket half way across the world in minutes at very low cost.    Its weaker than gold or silver, in that it makes a poor Apocalypse Zombie Currency; but I have a cutting katana and leather riding jacket for such an eventuality! :-D

Hard for this to happen in the US/EU as bank debit cards are so simple to use and easy to get, and payroll deposits generally become available funds on deposit or soon after.  
Whereas with bitcoin, I queue up an $xxx purchase on an exchange via ACH and it takes a week or so before the btc is in the exchange wallet for me to distribute to a personal wallet.   
Maybe this isn't a big deal for a speculator making a buy to hold; but to make the step to its potential for retail use it has to become quicker, cheaper, and easier to initially fund.
OTOH, in btc's defense retail wise, once in a wallet it generally moves faster from wallet to wallet to wallet once its in btc format. ie, you buy widget and pay vendor, vendor has the actual btc to spend for widget parts usually in minutes, not days, and can send that minutes old deposit to his supplier, regardless of the supplier's location or local currency as soon as a couple confirmations are in.
That initial funding step really needs work though...

You also miss my point about how the bitcoin would be used if I made a similar purchase; the Thai kid wouldn't even be in the loop, never would have access.   You'd pay to an address printed on a business card, or address in an email message.   The owner would get the bitcoin with no intermediary.

bitcoin is never worse than cash is now.  A rich guy now might carry a couple hundred USD in cash, a debit card linked to a checking account with 10k+50k overdraft; and a credit card or two with 50k-200k of credit line.  The rest takes days, or even weeks to transfer and settle.    
The thief can easily rob the couple hundred USD at gun point, and the rich guy will be annoyed, and the thief will probably think he made a great score, usual end of story.
If the rich guy is a show off that enjoys display behavior, the thief may try to get cash from an ATM, or use the credit cards if really unwise.   But still, the rich guy is basically unharmed financially.
Bitcoin will not change that dynamic.   A thief can force me to give him the $30 worth on my phone in a manner of seconds; the $x hundred on my Surface can't get gotten to in under a full minute (that's a long time to hang around pointing a gun at someone btw...); but he'll have to wait to bank hours, walk in with me to the bank (or whatever 3rd party secure physical storage exists in your future), sign in, and get to my safe deposit box, to get any significant stash.    All of that is COMPLETELY unrealistic for a stick-up.
The thief will get $30 or a few hundred at best, and call himself incredibly lucky.

What in the world would make you think a $12k IOU for an asset that is easily and routinely traced to questionable activities, issued by a company that absolutely MUST strictly abide by US banking regulations, is a good idea?
The company is doing exactly what they have said they would do, and exactly what they are legally required to do.  How does that make them a BAD company?
Coinbase seems a great and easy company to buy bitcoin with, and transfer that bitcoin immediately to a wallet you control.    OTOH, it seems absolutely insane to me, to transfer ANY bitcoin acquired in the wild, TO coinbase for conversion to fiat or worse to hold for any length of time.  That just can not work; if one nibble of one transaction went through the darknet'ish sites for illicit or questionable products, there is NO WAY coinbase can consent to convert to fiat, and pretty much MUST lock/freeze/close the account.
@_date: 2016-10-10 17:59:44
With paypal/visa I have a large currency conversion fee.   Are you volunteering to pay it for me?   bitcoin's transaction fee is far less.
You're also missing the point; the 15yr old is the CASHIER, not the owner of the store.  Not the person that payed to print their little business card.   Just like taco-bell, the clerk takes your card, charges the right amount and then gives you the taco; then takes your card number and sells it on the dark side.     No different here; the cashier/clerk gets the order and fills it, he has no reason not to fill it, and if he doesn't I'll call (or now email) and complain; but he also has no ability to steal anything else.
nb... I'm not pimping bitcoin, I frankly don't care which blockchain currency is available and works, and would love a US government initiated system with full tracing, zero anonymity, but the same class of nationless, low fee transactions.   I'm not holding or investing in any of these, just keep enough to spend on stuff I want from people I want to buy from wherever they  happen to be.

I have three separate wallets (online, 2pc &amp; 1 mobile); If I spin up a clean vm, install copay, import and give it the 12-word phrase for the mobile, can I then send the bits from the original mobile wallet to another address using that vm?

I would think if you are only buying and selling bitcoin that originated to you from coinbase; then coinbase is probably pretty trustworthy.
If you receive coins from the wild;  say while on safari you sell some brand name golf balls that normally have ridiculous import duties to some dude from Mozambique, and he pays you in bitcoin, but those bitcoins two transactions back were used to buy or sell drugs, that 0.1 btc worth of greedy arbitrage could get your entire holdings on coinbase permanently frozen.
So as long as your coinbase coins are all coinbase derived or sold; probably pretty safe; but if you want to use them as merchant or consumer, transfer a chunk off to an app wallet on a phone or laptop and do all your in-the-wild capitalism from that wallet...   AND DO NOT TRANSFER THOSE BACK TO COINBASE.

There can be some interesting accounting hickups; as you are essentially bartering; so you have to think of it as accepting one non-currency asset in exchange for another.

We don't see it in the US/EU so much because our current infrastructure with banking and debit cards and such are really very efficient and slick.   I do carry some cash, but rarely use it; even to buy a 50cent orange, its easier to slide the card through the reader than to fish out a buck.
However, try to get the same efficiency internationally and things get a little expensive; try to do it internationally with a small retailer in Changmai that can't even take visa/mc; has no web site or aggregator... well, forget it.    Till bitcoin.   I very much can send him 400 baht worth of bitcoin and end up with a book in my mailbox in a couple weeks, without paying $40 to a bank.   Compared to the last time I did a similar trick with a bank card?  Identify theft out the wazoo (I reconcile daily, so no harm, but dang, that was annoying!)

Whether its $20 worth of manga, or a $5 magazine/single, or a $3 electronic part from doohickey China; I order them, they show up.   That's the way its always worked for me.

And why do you care if I or someone else solves a problem with bitcoin?

Normal is where the government issues treasuries and private parties and other governments purchase them.   At the moment, the government is basically holding its own loans, basically an indirect monetization.   eg, an atypical means of creating new money, as opposed to the normal means of regular fractional reserve lending.
bitcoin seems to be operating as it has been previous, eg normal.
normal &amp; not normal should not be equated with good or bad; but rather a simple excursion from prior practice.

But you do bring up something worthwhile.  Meaningful sums.   If its a meaningful sum, I can do an international wire transfer, and the fee becomes a reasonable percentage.
Bitcoin lets you buy a $5 book or $30 hat from someone thousands of miles away, from someone who may have a crappy banking situation or even none at all.   If its a $1000 purchase, I'd do a wire transfer from my bank; no biggy, the fees become a reasonable percentage of the cost.
The point is about SMALL purchases.   One off situations.   I'm not hawking bitcoin's awesomeness or whatever, I'm describing how it is useful to ME.
As to paypal, the particular instance occurred before paypal had substantial history, and I'd never used them before for an international payment; not sure if they even did the currency conversion thing at the time.  Can you even look up what paypals' policy and fees was in year-x for converting to currency-y?

thanks; I kept having this weird thought that the 12-word seed was an encryption key used on a physical file to recover as the backup; as opposed to the wallet ID/addresses being built from the 12-word itself.    So the backup isn't so much a stored transaction log on the computer, but rather a newly rebuilt wallet and list of transactions that are generated by the 12-word seed.
This really is a pretty cool piece of tech.  Hope it hangs around for a while.

Maybe not replace, but certainly provide an equally potent alternative.

The way the world's banks defused this depression kept us away from breadlines and grain rotting in the field; but also locked in an enormous amount of monetization.    Basically balancing the deflationary pressure of the depression, against the inflationary pressure of monetization, in order to create an environment with non-negative inflation, so the basic farmer doesn't spend $1000, get a perfectly good harvest, get $900 revenue, and then lose $100 in the process of paying off the $1000 because of natural deflation.   The process can destroy the industrial ag economy and leave shelves empty even when more than enough grain is grown.

Its just a floating point number; its divisible down to how far the market wants to divide it; what matters is:  Can all fiat millionaires own enough bitcoin to be able to near instantly put a year's worth of living expenses for their brats in nearly any country they want, at nearly any time they want, with some degree of irreversibility. 
The answer to that question, is, and likely always will be, yes.

Certainly.  Having 100% exposure on BTC would be nuts.   Having 0% doesn't seem very canny either though.

You're just trolling,   what $3k/month home burns only $100/month in electricity.  Mine's paid for, but even when it was running at $1000/month mortgage, the electricity was about $250/month.   
As to your snide comment about Ohio, if you're a native Ohio resident, and you like your state, what's wrong with staying.  Basically, you've created a bad retirement plan that guarantees that you're a slave to your house till the day you die.    I think I'd pass on that plan.

Well the manga were sent from the store, and received undamaged. (I've physically been in the store, fwiw)  But the cashier with the card number of course helped himself and friends and could have made off with a bunch in fraud were I not watching.
With a bitcoin transaction, again, I could lose the amount of the purchase; but that is the limit of the exposure.   Acceptable risk for a legal product that is essentially unavailable in the US. (though availability has improved in recent years for this sort of thing, which is nice).
And fine, "my friend" is my s/o; bought as a gift.   Why do these specifics at all matter to the use case of international purchase of modest sized retail goods not typically available at local or US/Amazon style markets?
I don't like Doraemon, I do like plenty of other manga, and wouldn't mind saying it was for me, if it had been.
In the end, you seem to hate the idea that bitcoin could be used to purchase legitimate goods, from merchants outside the US controlled banking system.      I personally think its a really cool property of the bitchain concept, and look forward to a US treasury sponsored version of bitDollars or something that transacts as easily  with someone in Kyrgystan selling hats, just as if I'd walked into his shop and handed him the appropriate amount of the local currency; without PAYING CHASE or CITIBANK an extra $40 for the hat!!!

It would depend on where you live.    I could see 10 coins buying a generic 1500 sqft house in Texas not THAT far in the future....   Buying a large house in San Francisco otoh, not so much.

Depends on what you want with regard to health care.  Are you willing to tell a doc, "no, I don't want that service", or, "No, I don't feel that service provides adequate value."    
Learn to say "no".  Your healthcare will not cost millions.   You will still make it to age 80 or so.... most likely.    You want to really do something about your health? Go walk more.
As to mishaps... Most folks have some kind of policy with deductibles and max out of pocket; they really do work as described.   Most folks with $1mil in assets have pretty decent policies that run $10k - $20k / year, maybe a little more, and if they are professional employees may also have that coverage paid for by their company or at least with pre-tax dollars.

Bonds are safe(ish), but have very low yield.  Having diverse investments, including some high risk ones, is perfectly normal.

Something that strikes me as curious, couldn't some core developer be sitting on code that could be quickly pushed to make their software accept the ChinaCoin bigblock blocks to hold the chain together, and THEN hardfork a segwit+bigblock+pow change at the PoW adjustment point?
Even if the bigblock code is garbage, segwit isn't, and without the asic cheat in play, hashrate shouldn't concentrate again; thus a meaningless change in base blocksize, segwit, and honest pow algorithm are all "fixed"...
Any reason why that can't happen?
