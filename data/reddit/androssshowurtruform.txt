I get what you’re saying. Using the amount of bitcoin sold (.33 in your example) and calculate the gains on that amount.
What if he bought at several different times? So his cost basis is $1000, but let’s say he bought half at 500 and half at 1500...what price does he base the “gains” off?

But has he actually realized any gains? He’s withdrawing his initial investment at 0 profit.

Dude that water analogy is so clearly void of understanding. That couldn’t be farther from what I’m trying to do. It seems like you are saying you don’t understand what the benefits of crypto are over fiat? There’s plenty of information online and ppl that can argue the merits way better than I can. 
It’s not about getting rich, it’s about changing the way we do financial transactions. Profiting is definitely a perk though.

Calm the fuck down everyone. This is a hot/cold storage issue that's it. From CoinBase's website 
"Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage." 
With most of the community pissed about how yesterday went down it's no surprise lots of BTC being moved to other exchanges. Coinbase can't keep up with a big shift like this because again, only 2% is accessible at a given moment.

Lol let me stop you right there. BTC is the most widely legitimized coin and to +95% of the population is synonymous with crypto. 
BTC has it's issues but at this point it's still everyone's first entry point into crypto. For that reason everyone should root for BTC to succeed - and i mean EVERYONE - because when BTC succeeds crypto as a whole succeeds. 
The coin trashing is like going back to the 1990's and arguing with people who are on the fence about the internet, the merits of Internet Explorer vs Netscape navigator. Shut the fuck up. Let them get online first and then worry about which browser they use later. If we really want blockchain to get mass adoption shut the fuck up with the in fighting. 
Can we stop shooting ourselves in the foot with the coin trashing please?

Your logic is flawed. You don’t like beer don’t drink beer. I don’t care. But that doesn’t mean you have to constantly shit on beer and try to prevent other people who are thinking about it from trying it. That makes you an asshole. Same goes for alt coins as well. 
If someone new to crypto asked me about it I’d probably tell them to diversify, buy a couple different things and don’t put in more then they’re willing to lose. I wouldn’t badger them into a specific coin or turn them off to the entire thing by bringing up drama.

its about data dude. FB core business is selling you to advertisers. Think about what information they can extract on people using their coin, particularly when they tie identities to transactions. Supporting BTC or other coins doesn't offer that.

Lower case assange has publicly said he doesn't like hillary and preferred Trump. He then timed/encouraged the subsequent release at a point he felt would be most damaging to her campaign. There's evidence of this in Muller's indictments and subsequent report. 
Lower case assange can get fucked. Wikileaks started cool and with good intentions but has become a bankrupt shell of itself.

Be honest with her. The longer you continue to make financial decisions that effect both of you without telling her the more you risk her being resentful over it. 
I can't see her being mad given she's coming up on $1m. If you have disagreement on how to spend the money/how much to sell, guess fucking what that's part of being married. 
Personally, I'd sell what ever I need to pay off all debts, including home mortgage. From there you can decide how much additional cash you need/want access to and sell that. It's unlikely your wife will stop working, but if you're able to pull out an extra $100K so she can quit her job she fucking hates and find a new one that makes her happier...isn't that why we're all here...Because we believe in a new system that fosters financial freedom for ourselves and loved ones?

When something has less than 1% adaption it’s never down. It’s either up, on sale, or drops to absolute fucking zero. Considering there’s too much black market appeal and distaste for banks crypto will never go to zero unless the government steps in (really doubt it).
So we can refine our terms to bitcoin is never down. It’s either up or on sale.

Your logic is flawed. Withholding of documents is not the litmus test for an organization being politically motivated. The deliberate, politically motivated seeking and releasing of documents out of assanges public political alignment and distaste for Hillary Clinton is proof enough.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:55:09
Do your own homework dude. This will be the last time I do it for you. Google is your friend. Here are examples ONLY from the 2016 election. I could go on. Like i said, do your own homework.   
1) Assanges wikipedia page: "The timing of WikiLeaks' DNC E-mail dump (aka the "Guccifer 2.0" hack) were released only after Clinton had all but secured her party's nomination, and not during the primaries, or before [Bernie Sanders]( dropped out. This timing appears to be intended to hurt Clinton's chances against Trump in the general election"   
2) Associated Press covering Muller indictments.  
"Over the next several weeks, WikiLeaks requested any documents related to Clinton, saying they wanted to release them before the Democratic National Convention when they worried she would successfully recruit Sanders supporters.
We “think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary ... so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting,” WikiLeaks wrote."  
3) Same AP article describes how Trump campaign was in contact with Wikileaks throughout the summer of 2016.   
"“Assange — what’s he got? Hope it’s good,” Boyle wrote to Stone.
“It is,” Stone wrote back. “I’d tell Bannon but he doesn’t call me back.”
Hours later, Assange held a news conference in which he appeared to waffle on whether he would release additional documents about Clinton.
Bannon reached out to Stone: “What was that this morning???” Stone chalked it up to a “security concern” and said WikiLeaks would be releasing “a load every week going forward.”
By Oct. 7, the Trump campaign was embroiled in its own scandal. The Washington Post released audio of Trump bragging about sexually harassing and groping women. But within hours, WikiLeaks gave Trump’s team a break.
The first set of emails stolen from Podesta’s accounts popped onto WikiLeaks’ website. Stone’s phone lit up. It was a text message from a Bannon associate.
“well done,” it read."  
4) Other source: WashingtonPo article about the special councel's indictment of 12 Russian military officers [  
"**June 22, 2016**. An unnamed organization, later indirectly identified in the indictment as WikiLeaks, reaches out to Guccifer 2.0 (apparently over Twitter) to request he/they '\[s\]end any new material \[stolen from the DNC\] here for us to review and it will have a much higher impact than what you are doing.'
  
WikiLeaks subsequently requests any information about Clinton over the short term because the Democratic convention was approaching, after which Clinton “will solidify bernie supporters behind her.” WikiLeaks notes that they think “trump has only a 25% chance of winning” so “conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting.'"

This. 100%. I used to support Wikileaks when it was about transparency. Now it's about politics.

Selective transparency is not transparency. It’s manipulation. Transparency is great but wielding it as a weapon for political purposes is detrimental. Political manipulation and propaganda under the veil of transparency is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Assange can get fucked. He sold out.
