If I buy a pair of pants with bitcoin from Overstock, then send them back for a refund, and during the time they were in transit bitcoin's value explodes to 30X, would I get to have 30 times the value of the pants returned to me? No, I would probably get USD back for the value of the pants.
It would be fair to receive an equivalent value of Zimbabwe dollars if Zimbabwe dollars could be easily dumped for an equivalent USD or bitcoin, or if I lived in Zimbabwe. They are not easily convertible so it isn't a good analogy.
It is true that having to convert the BCH sucks, since there will be fees for the transactions, but it is more fair than having to give you far more money's worth of bitcoin than you ever put in. When you traded your bitcoin for a service, you effectively sold off your bitcoin. You don't get to expect to benefit from bitcoin's growth anymore.
I'm sorry though. It does suck.

I'm not trying to be contrarian, but if Overstock had lead in their trousers and had to do a recall, and the sudden trouser shortage pushed the price of trousers way up, they would probably give me back what I paid, not the new value of trousers.

I hate Ver as much as the next guy here, but this sounds relatively fair. You paid $298, whether paid in bitcoin or not, and are getting $298 back. Sucks that your investment didn't pay off as much as expected, but at least you're not getting scammed.

Can someone smarter than me explain why he (or them) would want to do this? The price is hugging the wall consistently, which would seem to suggest that if they bumped their sell price up they could profit more. The price just seems too stable to be making money off this by some weird strategy.

That guy appears to have been a nut.

Well, that's just your not valuable opinion.

It is flawed because there's no reason for a solar roadway when you can have a solar roof instead with a fraction of the effort.

You think that the government might try to kill you for calling John Oliver propaganda?

Except bitcoin's going up today....

I don't think it's clear what's happening in this image. It looks like some guy in a lizard suit, standing on some weird boxes, lifting a rich ape. Not godzilla bitcoin vs. banker king kong.
Why isn't the lizard dude an actual lizard, rather than a guy wearing a lizard suit? If there was other buildings around and indicators of scale, then it would look more like a monster fight.

I imagine that as soon as any amount of those coins move, the price of bitcoin will drop dramatically. It might not take many transactions from that wallet to influence the price significantly. I also imagine that as the tech gets close to the point that it is possible to get the keys, whales and institutions will automatically be checking the highest wallets every block to determine if the price is about to fall because something's moved out of them, effectively dropping the price preemptively.

I didn't say it wouldn't be dropping tomorrow or over the next week or year. I just stated the truth that TODAY, the price is going up. So the title isn't right.
Any other statements of fact you want to argue against?
