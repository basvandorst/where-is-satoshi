What dip? 1btc = 1btc. There won't be a dip in total supply for another year or two right?

I dunno... The infrastructure is also falling apart. It's getting less decentralized all the time.

I'm trying to buy bitcoin through Coinbase, but I'm failing miserably. I've done two transactions, and both were rejected due to being "potentially high-risk". I asked support what's the problem and what I need to do to continue, but they didn't help.
Has anyone had similar problems with Coinbase?

Don't listen to the haters, keep accumulating more crypto, just don't overextend yourself in the short term. Everyone claiming to know which way the price is going is only fooling themselves.

Considering the rising strength of the U.S. Dollar, sideways movement isn't such a bad thing.

It may be the Daddy Mack, but until recently IOTA did not follow its rises and falls the way other altcoins did. Why should we have to pay any transaction fee at all?
