Ah. I thought he was having an issue with converting to fiat... which, now that I think about it, is completely stupid. My apologies.

I'll give you points for being more mature than your other posts came across as, and if the deletion thing is true then that's odd - perhaps because of downvotes or something, idk. Either way, I think if there was something shady going on, the telltale sign wouldn't be the creation date of the sub.

What shit.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:14:32
The more you know! Thanks for the insight.

I think they're saying, if you're worried about BTC-e taking your coins, transfer them to a different wallet.

Feels shady as fuck? Good, then piss off and let the rest of us continue without your idiotic input.

This. I see it as needing four major steps.
**1.** *A bitcoin-accepting (or exclusive?) auction site comes along, and gains foothold. This could take well over a year though.*
**2.** *They integrate with existing Bitcoin infrastructure such as Coinbase or even exchanges directly, allowing for higher liquidity of BTC.*
**3.** *Integration with fiat-management companies (credit-unions, banks, smaller e-commerce businesses at first) to allow smoother transfer between local currency and global currency**.
**4.** *eBay/PayPal cave and incorporate Bitcoin into their services. Elon Musk is an extremely smart man, and if BTC reaches the penetration needed for the above to occur I cannot see him allowing PayPal to sit on the sidelines of this. Instead I predict PayPal (attempting at least) will eventually be equipped to transfer Bitcoin in the same manner as fiat.*
*I get the feeling that this smooth transition of money idea will be a huge change-up for the world economy, but may never happen due to the intense amount of political pressure that it will come under.
**Note:** as with anything Bitcoin, the probability of my predictions being correct lie somewhere between 0 and 1.

Add useless bullshit to your post, expect useless bullshit in return.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:33:15
Holy fuck what.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: hell no.

CoinJar mate, by far. 2% buying fee, 1% selling fee.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:41:06
So there's that, too.
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:40:09
Working on it...
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:50:07
Problem with coming off as a know-it-all asshat?
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:49:10
I know that, but you can store BTC on there to trade with.

Let's not get too ahead of ourselves, m'kay?

Wrong subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:50:37
It's because you ran in screaming "HOLY FUCK WHAT THE HELL WHY IS IT HIDDEN JESUS THAT'S SO SUS". A simple "Can anyone explain why..." would've received much more positive responses, I'm sure.

Can back up OPs experience with CoinJar. All around their service is fantastic. My first few deposits and withdrawals were with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, with an avg. deposit time of 24 hours.
For NAB (National Australia Bank - same as OP) my first few deposit times were ~2 days, meaning if one intends to catch any dips they'll need to have fiat in CoinJar ready (also, CJ matches to BTC-e's price I believe, meaning they're consistently AUD$50-100 under Mt. Gox!). I've so far had one 15-minute deposit time, when I did the transfer around 10pm at night on a weekday.

and then turn your head to the side... 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:34:52
I'd say the easiest way is to do a bank transfer, which if done with NAB can sometimes result in you having your bitcoins within 15m. The *quickest* way though is to do a cash deposit at any NAB branch (you don't need to be a customer to do a deposit) - it's the most likely chance you have or receiving the coins before you're even home from doing the deposit. If not, by 10am the next business day at the latest.

Upvote because I sincerely hope that was sarcastic.
I don't hate bitcoin at all, but unsupported claims of 50-150x increases of price alongside supposed news that a world-leader will back the currency is huge and requires something tangible if it's going to be looked at as anything but lunacy.
