Hardware wallet....
Keys and passwords are microscopic and can be stored literally anywhere, 100 trillion dollars of bitcoin could be put just about anywhere meaning it has an infinite amount of protection vs thousands of pounds of precious metals

You need only invest minor focus for a few minutes to figure out how to store and use cryptocurrency

If you didn’t care about price you would hold your money in a better crypto than BTC lol, there are many better coins if we look at crypto as only a currency and not a store of value, shut up idiot I know you’re refreshing your portfolio value 100+ times a day.

Your money is stuck in Robinhood, can’t be transferred through BTC only sold and through a 3-7 day verification and withdrawal process, do not use robinhood for crypto investing if you want any control over your investment

10 years from now you’ll have a slightly older lambs than most others who bought in sooner

Coinbase is a 1.49% flat fee so you would have saved about a dollar and change buying through them

I just love how much logic and history these price predictions are based on

Well you’ll pay the difference based on fluctuation but if you’re waiting on the withdrawal from Robinhood to hit your account that will be a few days, and in that time the market could fluctuate wildly in waiter direction, also factor in coinbase fees which depending on the amount you’re buying will likely be around $5

Don’t, you should be very afraid of missing out

Pure speculation but if I were you I’d wait for a correction, there’s a chance of breaking to 12 15 and 20k but there’s too much risk IMO to buy significant amounts right now when there’s a good possibility of a healthy pullback
