I assume BFX will use personal gain acccumulated till now to lower the margin lending/BTC holders losses am I correct?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:34:25
are the other major exchanges notified and willing to not process the hack coins?

As a margin funding provider, even if this approach will hurt I wish to know exactly how much personal bitfinex capital will be put in to lower the haircut.

Thank you for honesty. I think people need to know the fund % loss and if there's any chance you will not got insolvent.
PS :. I have an account with margin lending

hey any news?

You may not be able to identify the single coin, but you can track movements from wallet. They are already doing that at this very moment

i home you will not hit margin lenders for 100% of balance. Also... Are the major exchanges cooperating in avoid sell hack coin on them?

I am sorry, but I kinda hope you will not fully wipe lendings acccount to cover the hack.

I am sorry but I really can't see how a 70m transaction can't get a phone call to the CEO of BFX saying "should we fo this?"

I personally think the IOU is a very good idea, even my boss is kinda OK with that.

Well then I think :

I actually withdraw FIAT  without problems. Very much delay for large amounts of money there. You have to plan carefully for profiting, possibly using  currency pair chainging too for denying the standard withdrawal fees.
