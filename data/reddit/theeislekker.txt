Well yeah I get what you mean but BTC are mostly used to avoid currency controls and to store wealth in a non conventional way. For that application transaction time isn't very critical. Trust in the technology is way more important and first mover privilege means BTC is the most trusted and will continue to be the most trusted cryptocurrency for a while. 
I think you are still thinking in the old paradigm of BTC as currency, but nobody ever wanted to use it in that fashion, apparently so that's a bit irrelevant.

The core value was that it was decentralised. Everything else was secondary to that.


I'm pretty sure that was never a stated goal.

Who are the "powers that be"? The politicians will be retired by then. The rich people will get even more capital mobility which is extra super fine for them.

As somebody who used the NHS and am now paying out of pocket for sub-par health insurance in the Netherlands, I sorely miss the NHS. 
BTW, did you know that paying out of pocket for health care insurance doesn't exclude the possibility of being put on a waiting list? I can tell you from personal experience that it feels a special kind of "nice" to be paying the health care insurance bill monthly while you have been waiting for months to see a specialist.

The price of Bitcoin makes no difference, unless you are trying to use it to speculate in which case, you are doing it wrong.

"Double spending" has no meaning without decentralisation. 
The whole problem is, "how do you get to have a decentralised currency without some fuck trying to double spend their coins"? Decentralisation does not accomplish the goal. Decentralisation creates the problem of double spending in the first place. It's mining that accomplishes the goal.
You know literally nothing about this. You should stop posting.

You cannot deny that cryptocurrencies were crucial for ransomware to emerge as a type of malware. That is not to say that Bitcoin is bad because of ransomware, but this is an unpleasant side effect of cryptocurrencies.

Why have the libertarians on here been consistently negative regarding the government's approach to bitcoin?
Your predictions were wrong. The government doesn't fear bitcoin. They embraced it and legalised it. Maybe, just maybe, there is something wrong with your world view. 
Also I wonder how many of the same legislators are currently "insider-trading" on Bitcoin, knowing fully well that any positive news drives the price up...etc. 
Oh and one feature of Bitcoin that people have not brought up yet: Bitcoin is a great means to receive bribes from lobbyists. 


As if rich people ever feared a new way to avoid paying taxes.
