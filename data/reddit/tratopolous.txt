Oh, For sure. I'm not saying there aren't problems with coinbase. I just had a good experience this time. Which is rare tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:27:15
I bought in my biggest at the 16k mark on the way down. I was pissing my pants on the dip but HODLing paid off. TO THE MOON!

A Buy wall is when somebody puts in a large order at a certain price and the sell wall is the opposite. So today I am seeing a stairstep Sell wall pattern. It is odd. Every $10 price point there is 100 Coins for sell. ([around the $15,150 range](
This doesn't help predict the price movements tho. It takes a good bit of buying pressure to break walls like that but it has happened before. And Sell Walls tend to prop the price up a bit but again, I've seen them eaten in a heartbeat. The other thing is, most of these walls are managed by bots, so when the price works its way up to a sell wall, there is a good chance the bot cancels the order and moves it to a higher price. Same goes for a Buy wall. We all want to buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest.

lol I know the drill. I just like to watch the exchange because it is interesting. My HODL is Strong.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:54:03
I've never seen walls set up like that before. What is it for and why would somebody do that?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:17:58
It is interesting to say the least
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:48:10
yeah, the fact that Coinbase screws you with barley a warning. They normally charge you above market value by a couple of percent. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:55:03
No, GDAX you buy and sell on a limit order. So you can say you want to buy 100 BTC at $0.1 and it'll just sit there until it is filled. That is extreme but I normally set to buy a few hundred lower than current price and I don't sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:53:17
I think Ether is really hurting everything else right now. I expect ether to correct in a few days and BTC will pump again. But your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:52:20
Bitcoin won’t make a good currency until it stabilizes. Rising at 1-5% a year (basically the opposite of inflation). So the end game is for bitcoin to stop rising. We just have to find the actual value first. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:10:23
This looks like a very good day for BTC. Id love to see 17k but Im betting we settle around 16.7k ish
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:46:52
Yeah I just hadn't seen the stair step wall like that before.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:18:47
I see alot of coinbase hate but I just wanted to tell a story in their defense. My wife's car broke down the other day so yesterday I sold a little BTC on GDAX and sent it to my bank around 10am. Expecting not to get the money for a week. My bank account received the money around 4pm yesterday. So when anyone says BTC is not liquid, I have proof that it is more Liquid than my normal Savings account which takes 3-5 days to transfer. While I don't like some Coinbase/GDAX things, this was a nice surprise.
Sidenote: I have other saving not in crypto that we could have used to fix the car. I don't have money I can't afford to lose in Cyrpto. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:28:52
It isn't alt money. At least not all of it. Etherium is still bouncing near ATH and there is alot of new money in Ether. Plus, BTC jumped 10% and most alts were hit with a 5% ish fall. So there is some new money coming in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:34
Coinbase is fine, It will lock you in at whatever price. Just know that it will not show up for a week. If you start trading large amounts and want liquidity or lower fees, go to a exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:15
lol pretty much. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:03
oHHH SHITTT there goes the wall! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:52:30
Anybody’s guess is as good as mine but I see lots of walls pop up that are propping the price. Yesterday at 13k today at 14k. It very well could drop back down soon but I honestly don’t think it will. When it dipped hard a couple days ago there was a 1k buy wall at 10.2k on GDAX but it never got there
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:09
It is taken from the amount. IF you buy $100, you are actually buying $97.01 and 2.99 goes to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:40
14K ceiling busted!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:42
Thats how I started. Now I am a addict
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:23:09
I don't know what is going on right now with the BTC price since it keeps going up but when I look at the exchanges, There seems to be alot more selling pressure. I guess alot of buys at market value?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:42
Yes, It locks you in. I wouldnt expect it to show up until the delivery date tho. Conbase sucks about that
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:44:48
Dec. 28th I believe
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:25:46
So for the B2X fork, will coinbase/GDAX support B2X immediately or will we have to wait six months before we can get the B2X? I wasn’t around for the BCH fork so I don’t know how it works
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:41:59
Whoever it is, it keep the price fixed at a price point. Or trying to at least. The volume is low today so a 300 but wall is enough to bounce it. It’s interesting to see. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:27
Same, I'm still guessing we hit 25k before the new year
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:04:03
My reason is so I can see my total value on my phone. Also everyone says not to leave coins on an exchange as if GDAX is less safe than Coinbase. Honestly I don't know. I just like to see my cyrpto balance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:31
I bought $1000 at 16,900 a couple weeks back. The HODL is strong in me.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:32:07
But to answer your question, yes you can buy $1 of bitcoin if you really want. Coinbase has a $2.99 or 1.5% fee depending on which one is more. After you get your feet wet, if you want to buy more there are better ways than coinbase but it’s great for beginners 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:11:32
less than 1%
Actually, less than 1% of my total portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:12:31
Come on! crack that wall!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:18
Can anyone explain buy walls to me, I am pretty new. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:08
Yeah I had read that. One of the reasons I’m not super trusting of coinbase but I don’t have a computer and so my wallet options are limited. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:08
It is probably there, Coinbase gets alot of shit on here but it is probably the most trustworthy exchange. Fees and transaction times suck ass tho
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:16:02
Picked up a load at 16k thinking that was the dip so same boat. I’m sure by mid feb we will be fine. I’m hoping mid Jan but we will see
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:44:21
Somebody wants the bounce to be at 12,500
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:42:07
It’s odd. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:46:58
why does this happen?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:09:54
They were doing that yesterday too. Somebody or some group is picking up a lot of coin while trying to keep the price from spiking 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:27:57
but will this be the bottom or not?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:27:26
You guys think this is the bottom or more dip to come?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:26
nice walls being made. Think its uphill from here
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:32
You buy from a bank draft. It locks in the price but you wont see the BTC in your account for a week ish
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:38:51
I love watching walls break on exchanges. I don't care for the boring stagnant times but when the price is bouncing all over, its fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:18
based on the sell walls I have seen, you should look at buying closer to 10.3k as somebody has an order for 500btc at 10.2k. I think it may dip again but not below 10k. No way the whales let it hit 50% drop from ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:25
it just bust a 400btc wall. shut up and go away
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:15:47
I bought LTC when Charlie announced he sold out because that proved to me that he wasn't in the cyrpto world for the speculation. I thought LTC would take off when everyone realized the creator isn't trying to get rich, just make an impact on the world. Maybe I was mistaken but I still think it is undervalued right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:48
If you used a promo code from a friend, coinbase will give you and your friend each $10 the first time you spend $100
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:29:05
You lost fees for sure, but the rest was probably just a move
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:29:30
Somebody is really pushing right now
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:44:35
I recommend starting small because if you care about the money, it will force you to learn about the tech behind it and then you will either get hooked or pull out. I won't say its a safe investment but you will learn for sure
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:48:01
That’s what’s odd. It’s done that several times today
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:43:35
GDAX is owned by coinbase, or the other way around. Whatever, They work together. What I am doing as a small time BTC investor, smaller than you will be. I do all my buying and selling through GDAX now to save on fees. After I buy/sell, I transfer to my Coinbase wallet. That transfer is instant and free. Also Coinbase has a decent app so I can check my investment on the go. When you want to get more altcoins or get more involved, you'll probably want to use Kraken and Binance or some others. Coinbase and GDAX are great to wet your feet. 
PS. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
