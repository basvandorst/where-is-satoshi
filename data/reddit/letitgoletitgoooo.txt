The free market at work. Maybe what you are looking for is a regulated product by a centralized entity?
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:52:31
He got his coins back?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:52:13
I see you support wannabe murderers. Nothing surprises me anymore here. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:21:31
Yes, we were able to read it in the original post. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:56:43
I take my words back then. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:43:28
You just want a free product while pretending you represent the community while nobody has an idea who you are. Did i sum that up correctly?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:13:44
Jesus Christ. You are sitting behind a computer right now. Stop fucking around and help the fucking guy. Stop telling him to contact people. He has been doing so for many days already. You fucking asshole. 
Just this reply alone already made sure i will never touch your shit site. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:44:55
So you don't have a single example of a paid shill here. No way. Didn't see that coming. Such a suprise. 
You 16 year old conspiracy nutters are all the same. Every single one of you. 
I also noticed something here. When someone is losing an argument they suddenly move to talking about your account's age. As soon as they do that you know they are getting totally frustrated. 
By the way do you realize the world works with time zones. Your monday morning is a different time elsewhere. Google it for more info. 
Hilarious all these people downvoting me. Yet not one of you can point out a paid shill here. You are angry at me for saying there are no paid shills here, you downvote me to "punish" me yet you fail to show me 1 paid shill. God, your life must suck if you downvote people on the internet because you don't like what they are saying. What a sad, sad fucking life. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:39:11
I shall make the sarcasm clearer next time. I really thought it wasn't needed here. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:09:50
So basically you have no idea and just pull random dates out of your ass at which something possibly might happen. Ok. 
And what banker/government attack??
You are very young, aren't you?
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:21:53
A pump. It comes before the dump. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:13:12
"Marijuana Flower Buds" as in weed? Pot? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:26:52
He had control of his own life. He and only he is to blame. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:04:47
What does this possibly have to do with Bitcoin??
And of course downvoted without an answer. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:51:28
Well a lot of companies actually started to accept Bitcoin in 2014 but after 6 months found out nobody uses it to pay and simply removed it. And they forgot or couldn't be bothered removing blog posts, footers. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:44:59
Really? Interesting. How do you know?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:58:16
Let's try this again. 
Are you seriously saying "the banks" are paying people to troll this sub?
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:19:09
Someone in this thread is downvoting hard. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:03:59
I read the first sentence and realized you still can't point out one example and stopped reading there. So don't bother replying anymore. I won't read it. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:14:04
Good for him. I got an anon pm claiming how they held his coins because he was a criminal and LE would be involved. I guess it was Cryptsy doing damage control. 
Was there a new thread about it when it got solved? If so got a link maybe?
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:29:11
Should have. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:18:15
Maybe he should fix the banking system first and its billions in fraud and money laundering. Plenty of work to be done there before focusing on something tiny as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:16:33
Thanks for reposting 3 days old news for the 40th time. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:23:54
Yeah, just take a look at your post history how you did not want to spam. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:50:07
Jesus dude. It's a scam! S-C-A-M!
He isn't gonna answer shit or fix anything. Because it's a scam. Not fixing things and running off with the money is what scammers do. 
Get back to reality. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:31:59
I don't really understand you? Are you saying the banks run an "army" to troll @_date: 2015-02-04 16:42:56
Uh what? Were you supposed to reply to me?
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:59:44
Welcome to the free market. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:58:44
What part of my post is trolling? I'm serious. Where am i trolling? Or is this yet another case of i don't like facts so you are a troll?
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:46:43
There is not even a hint of evidence that Bitcoin will do well during an economic crisis. Neither is there any evidence that Bitcoin's price went up because of Cyprus. Zero. This is based on nothing but your believe and hope. And so far pretty much the rest of the world outside this sub disagrees with you. It's kinda insane how people like you act like it's some kind of certainty that the whole world will move to Bitcoin. 
And downvoting people on the internet you don't agree with is as pathetic as your life can get. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:30:33
Those "estimates" are completely useless. Stop fooling yourself. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:50:08
They don't really like to talk about such things here. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:14:20
Yo dude, pass me the Marijuana Flower Buds. I'm gonna make a Marijuana Flower Buds cigarette. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:13:36
It was an easy to recognize pump and dump. Easy money. 
Can someone tell me the reason of all the downvoting? I assume i said something horrible and i must be punished for it?
Here is where i called it yesterday by the way. I take it you guys will now downvote that horrible, horrible comment as well?
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:13:38
Do you realize not every one here is a druggie and knows what you are talking about. An url or explanation or something would help. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:21:07
Sure kiddo. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:23:51
You shouldn't hope so because these low prices and dropping down even more is extremely bad for Bitcoin. 
Or in your little fantasy world do you think you will buy coins at 100 and the week after we will go to 1000 just like that and you will become rich?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:37:11
Ok, i'm not sure if you are just messing around or not. 
Are you seriously saying "the banks" are paying people to troll this sub?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:31:07
Will they ever learn? How hard can it be?
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:47:38
Do you realize he knows nothing more about the price than my 6 year old cousin? He can say it will come back down but that doesn't mean it will. 
Yes it could, it could go to 1, it could go to 1000. 
Your first lesson today is to stop listening to other people who are as clueless about the price as you. NOBODY here knows what the price will do. Really nobody!
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:14:32
Over the last year i've seen many posts about how processor x enabled Bitcoin and 1000's of companies can now accept it. Everytime it was amazing news and moon time. Well, i don't have to explain you how that worked out. 
I doubt it will be any different this time. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:02:00
He has known about this matter all the time already you tool! He already replied to him in another thread a day ago. My reply still stands. He's simply stalling again for whatever reason he refuses to tell us. 
Believe me, he is very aware of the fact that they're holding his coins hostage all this time. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:43:22
Not this shit again. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:50:02
And this is somehow relevant to Bitcoin of course? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:24:03
He's right. I saw many arguments like that. Many. But of course we're gonna deny that now right?
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:40:36
God, that was a hilarious read!
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:28:29
You already posted this earlier today. Why again?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:15:20
The way this site works is that your reply gets posted below the post you replied to. You can stop quoting every post. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:29:51
Here's a thought experiment. A small city would already be too much to handle for the blockchain. Forget about countries. 
Maybe you should ask which village will move to Bitcoin first. We'll go from there. 
Edit: the downvote button is not for "facts you don't like". 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:56:13
And the only answer that is not allowed here. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:48:46
You will lose your money. I can guarantee you that. You also won't listen, do it anyway, lose your money and hate yourself. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:54:49
Because it once did accept Bitcoin. That site should update their listings. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:06:14
It's you're. And it's. English isn't my first language. I sure hope that's the case with you as well. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:28:31
Many here prefer fantasy land. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:20:47
Look up the transactions per second limit. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:18:34
Even a 6 year old is aware of this. But we're talking about their druggie hero so all common sense gets thrown out and ridiculous excuses are made. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:50:18
You're irritated that he doesn't want to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:01:44
I assume most wallet developpers aren't 16 year olds. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:09:52
Because you didn't notice it the rest of the world doesn't either? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:30:13
I assume people have learned by now. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:58:52
Yes it had a lot to do with that. 
Get your head out of your ass. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:59:38
There should be a seperate sub for posts about bitcoins dissapearing. It indeed is magical internet money. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:56:58
You didn't recognize a ponzi scheme? You just thought you we're gonna get rich quick without working right?
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:43:20
Tons of people who use 2fa get their shit hacked. Sure, it's an other layer of security but not that much as many here make it appear. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:22:40
Free market as Bitcoiners wanted. What is the problem again?
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:58:18
Get real. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:00:10
And this has what to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:54:26
So what if they do? And why is it so unbelievable?
They use dollars, maybe rubles, maybe Bitcoin, maybe sheep. That's how the world works. People pay and trade stuff. Yes even possibly with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:15:11
So Bitcoin relevant. Like the 20 other completely off topic threads posted today. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:01:07
We already been through this. The conclusion was that Gates is old, clueless about technology and irrelevant. This was after he mentioned he won't be using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:20:39
My prediction as well. Less and less people seem to be interested. I ran a little online coffee store. From about 15 transactions a month jan last year to pretty much 0 a month this jan. 
I also don't hear people talk about it anymore. And if i do it's negative. 
The current price of 220 seems too high for people wanting to buy. 
So not much to look forward to this year. At the moment it's nothing but a pump and dump controlled by traders. 
To all the downvoters, feel free to explain where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:46:19
Do you have any idea how drugs is produced and transported? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:39:36
Every day i see the craziest off topic posts that are somehow always relevant to Bitcoin. Circle jerk wise of course. 
But when the message is negative nothing ever has anything to do with Bitcoin. Funny how that works. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:53:52
Banks and governments aren't afraid of Bitcoin. 
The low price is a result of nobody buying coins. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:24:57
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:12:49
Let's try this again.
Are you seriously saying "the banks" are paying people to troll this sub?
Can you just answer the damn question already? What's the problem?
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:36:26
You should start writing for a sensationalist magazine. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:48:46
You can't be that stupid. Seriously, tell me you are just trolling. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:55:19
Traders. 
Hilarious how i'm getting downvoted. As if traders aren't completely controlling the price at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:25:45
99% of these merchants probably haven't seen 1 Bitcoin transaction.   
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:58:22
I stopped paying attention to phishing mails about 15 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:13:51
Yes. And it isn't Bitcoin. Get real. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:35:27
No, i'm truly curious how Bitcoin fits in this story. Because i know nobody here is naive enough to think Bitcoin will take over as a world wide payment system. That's obviously just insane. So what is it then? For some reason nobody can answer me. Just downvotes. Because censoring people they don't agree with is one thing that bitcoiners are very good at. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:34:00
Unless they post positive news of course. Then the same news site is upvoted to the mainpage. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 05:07:14
"I'm need long list of really awesome Bitcoin videos mostly for India, and for Pakistan"
Hilarious. Good luck finding even 1. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:11:12
Yo Cryptsy, it would be smart to tell us why you are holding this guy's coins hostage. This is very bad press for you. It might cost you a lot of customers. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:01:03
Not a bad article. But yeah i get it. Any article that doesn't fully praise Bitcoin and points out its flaws instead is FUD. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:12:09
The people involved with the drugs. Couldn't you figure that out yourself?
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:08:54
Still waiting. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:53:38
Don't worry. After they sell a bunch of these  useless contracts you might get your money. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:27:35
I noticed 1 thing Bitcoiners are really good at. And that is trying to censor everything they don't like. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:49:38
Do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:32:31
This just happened? 
I just look at some relevant subs (i guess, not familiar with them) and found nothing. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:59:31
Unless we only know half the story what exactly is being laundered? Just send the guys coins back. He isn't asking for dollars. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:04:12
Just buy 10 dollar worth and you'll have more than you make with those sites in 6 months. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:37:05
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:40:03
Not at all. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:08:26
Your non stop spam is getting very annoying ni'mmgonna report it from now on. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:02:31
Good thing NOBODY on this planet is dumb enough to deal with this company again. Right??
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:51:48
I just can't understand why it won't go mainstream. Why don't people want to use this system?
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:26:51
Do you realize there are 196 countries in the world that all have their own tax rules?
@_date: 2015-02-06 01:54:59
We found out about it the first 50 times it was posted and from the top thread on the mainpage which has been there all day. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:59:18
No matter if you have the right id or not or if they trust you or not what right do they have to keep your 180 coins?
What stops them from just returning them to you and close your account. Scammy. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 03:08:52
Yes please. And after you explained that you can tell me how this post is relevant to Bitcoin. Thanks. 
Why don't one of you downvoters answer me. Apparently you know something i don't. Enlighten me. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:34:31
Here an example of how customer support works. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:14:38
Fuck banks, fuck regulation, fuck laws!
The price is going down! We need regulation!!
Edit: He quickly changed his post after my reply. He first typed that we need regulation because of the price dropping. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:36:03
Occam's razor tells us that it's more likely that banks don't give a shit about Bitcoin and if they wanted to stop it they could do so by snapping their finger. Use some common sense man. 
Show me ONE example of a paid shill here. Just one. Don't type a fucking book again avoiding my question. Just show me ONE paid shill. That's all i ask. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:37:43
Again i ask you what exactly will happen in 2017. You're telling us to buy now because something will happen in 2017. So what will happen?
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:59:09
So Bitcoin is really just a get rich quick scheme? That's odd i keep reading here how it's not about the price. 
Anyway, why don't you explain to us what exactly will happen in 2017?
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:42:15
Uh yes. Very likely. What's your point?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:56:10
No way you are implying this was all made up. No way. Nobody is that retarded. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:42:14
Sidechains don't exist. 
Right now the blockchain wouldn't be able to handle a small city fully using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:47:30
Delay? Because it somehow is a sure thing Facebook will start using it?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:51:22
This guy has been spamming this virus domain for 2 days now and the url is still not banned. Why?
