I could speculate... what if the actions taken do not meet the legally required actions that they needed to take, and by sharing information, open themselves up to enhanced liabilities.  Perhaps they say something that they think is true now, but it turns out isn't true, and someone relies on those statements to their detriment.  Then they might open themselves up to even further liabilities.

The person put an envelope in a machine and said "This envelope is full of cash", so the computer credit's the account *provisionally* until the bank verifies the envelope is full of cash.  When the envelope turns out to be full of expired Twix coupons, the bank rescinds the provisional credit for the deposit.

Get 1,000 people in a room.  Some have apples and want money, some have money and want apples.  Poll them all and ask them, how much will you pay for an apple.  How much will you sell an apple for.  Line them up in order of their price they select.
Some people at the back end will only pay $.01 for an apple, some people are willing to pay $1, a few people are willing to pay $1.50, but a LOT of people are willing to pay $2. and only a teensy bit of people will pay $5 for an apple.
Apple sellers want to get the most dollars for their apples.  They will sell as many apples as they can to the $5 people... but soon the $5 buyers are satisfied and don't need anymore apples.  Now if you want to sell your apples you can sell them for $2.  There are a LOT of buyers at the $2 price... you can comfortable sell $2 apples all day long.  You may want to raise your price to $2.05 if you want to try to entice them to pay more, but if they wont budge, you are forced to buy into their wall if you want to sell, and no new buyers come.
When a sufficient amount of sellers come to the market, they may even satisfy the demand of all the $2 apple buyers, dropping it down to the $1.50 per apple price, and if they are all satisfied the price will continue to fall until a buyer is found.

What property qualifies for a Like-Kind Exchange?
Both the relinquished property you sell and the replacement property you buy must meet certain requirements. 
Both properties must be held for use in a trade or business or for investment.   Property used primarily for personal use, like a primary residence or a second home or vacation home, does not qualify for like-kind exchange treatment.
Both properties must be similar enough to qualify as "like-kind."  Like-kind property is property of the same nature, character or class.  Quality or grade does not matter. Most real estate will be like-kind to other real estate.  For example, real property that is improved with a residential rental house is like-kind to vacant land.  One exception for real estate is that property within the United States is not like-kind to property outside of the United States.  Also, improvements that are conveyed without land are not of like kind to land.
Real property and personal property can both qualify as exchange properties under Section 1031; but real property can never be like-kind to personal property. In personal property exchanges, the rules pertaining to what qualifies as like-kind are more restrictive than the rules pertaining to real property.  As an example,  cars are not like-kind to trucks. 
Finally, certain types of property are specifically excluded from Section 1031 treatment. Section 1031 does not apply to exchanges of:
    Inventory or stock in trade
    Stocks, bonds, or notes
    Other securities or debt
    Partnership interests
    Certificates of trust

Thanks.  While it is an easy answer, it is not an obvious answer.  Laws are tricky.  There are over 27,000 pages in the US Criminal code, an additional 10,000 pages of administrative regulations that have force of law, but were not passed by congress.  500 internationally treaties that exist that may obligate you to act, or not act in a certain way... and then various state, county, city regulations too.  It is quite nearly impossible to say with certainty that any action, or lack of action is legal or illegal, or what penalties may be imposed upon you for that action, or inaction.

I want to see 2 big-money groups come onboard.
1st.  In the USA, I want to see wall street.  Lets get Fidelity, and Vanguard, t. rowe price to start offering funds that own BTC, and you can put your IRA, 401K into them.  I don't want to see any non-traditional accounting tricks, leverage of this or that.  I want to with-hold money from my paycheck to buy BTC in some sort of tax-sheltered vehicle.
Lets see some morning star funds that own ~5% of their holdings in BTC (or whatever amount is prudent for the plans objectives)
2nd. I want to see nations hold a portion of their reserves in BTC.  Some nations have trillions of dollars in reserves.  If they moved even 1% of their reserves in BTC as a hedge, or an investment against their USD denominated reserves, that'd be a huge boost.  I'm talking about: Saudi Arabia, Germany, Russia, China, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Norway.  It would be a panic inciting event if they started doing that for the dollar, but huge for BTC.  And once one country started, the value of the USD would drop, and even more people would be inclined to do it.  It would be a race to the bottom, and the USD would devalue incredibly fast.  It would be a global catastrophe in the short term, but the world banking system has had this band aid on for a long time, and its time to rip it off.

What is to stop the following scenario:

Then X months later, i buy my coins from my friend for market value and immediately exchange them for goods/services at market value.
All of my transactions from cash to btc, and then from btc for goods/services were done at fair market value, but I had no realized gain or loss.  right?  My friend would, but that is his obligation to whatever entity he owes tax to.  right?

A group of people agree that the 'rules' have changed.  Once a majority of people agree to this change, the old chain of transactions is forked into 2 new chains... one that is considered 'valid' by the majority, and one that is not.  If the majority of people feel that bitcoin's hard limit of 21M needs to be changed, then a change to the code can be implemented, and if adopted by the majority, it will take effect.  If some random dude suddenly says that BTC now caps at 100M, and no one else agrees, that random dude will have his own fork that no one else agrees with, and therefore will not be valued.  But if everyone else agrees to the rule change, it will be accepted.

Yes, but do so with the same caution, and care and education that you would invest in a stock.  You wouldn't buy AAPL without knowing a little about Apple inc, their product line, their management and their financials.  Similarly, you should educate yourself about cryptography, and the finer points of the Bitcoin protocol. Read about how to secure your coins, read about what has happened to others when they failed to.  Read about past, present, and potential speculation on future Bitcoin regulations both in your country, and in the big players (US and China) to see what that means.  Bitcoin is still volatile and vulnerable to many threats.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Make sure you take any advice here with a grain of salt (even mine).  We're here because we believe... that doesn't mean we're right.

Depends on where you got it from.  I know Coinbase has my Name and address and all sorts of info on me.  If they report to the IRS, they'll know about me.
On the other hand if you mined all your coins, or bought them via local bitcoins with a Carmen San Diego disguise, and throw-away email addresses behind 7 proxies... sure, the IRS probably doesn't know about you.  Just like they didn't know about Al Capone's dealings (oh wait...)  
And even if you did do everything via local bitcoin, and never moved the cash into a bank account, and lived exclusively a cash lifestyle, the IRS still might wonder where an average Joe like yourself found the money for that new corvette (DMV registrations), or the trip to mexico (passport stamps), or that new house (County recorders office records) on your meager salary.  
The IRS isn't the Navy Seals, they're not going to come into your house and kidnap you.  Even worse, they're a bunch of math nerds with a hard-on for making you pay what you owe, and demanding proof.  IRS audits are uncommon, criminal prosecutions are exceedingly rare... but its a silly risk you take.

Hold on a sec... repayment of loans only partially extinguishes the money that was created by the loan.  Accepting that all currency is borrowed into existence and lent at interest, the only way to repay it is to pay back the principal and the interest.  The interest portion doesn't exist yet, and itself will have to be borrowed into existence.  There is no possible way in the fiat model of borrowing to existence to extinguish all debt.  You can control how fast the debt grows, but you can't reverse the upward trend of debt creation.  Eventually it will spiral out of amok.

Made me realize, that if someone like me can get flustered and nearly make a mistake, how many end users are not ready for BTC until it gets polished enough that mistakes like this are not a problem.  So many opportunities for improvement still exist.  Lets see what happens in 6-12 months.

I could see it hitting that easily.  Maybe not consistently, but peaking at that very often.  Imagine a worldwide bitcoin economy.  How many transactions on/around black friday?  Or during the holiday shopping season?  How many transactions on the 1st/15th of every month (payday), how many on the last day of the month (rent/mortgage due)  Lots of transactions could reasonably clump up to make mining during 'peak' times profitable.

With a public ledger I can see (almost) up to the minute what a company is making over what period of time.  No risk of insider information, no competitive advantage to be had by some information leaking about a competitor.
Unless corporations start 'washing' their coins in mixing services and sending them to different addresses.

It really isn't all that hard.  If you were buying a load of BTC with cash over the course of months your bank accounts would likely indicate it.  If you had an account with $10k in it, and over the course of 3 months you consistently withdrew $3k more than you deposited in cash withdrawls, the court would ask where that extra 3k was going.  That would look abnormal if your previous lifestyle showed an average income of $8k per month and $7k in expenses.  To suddenly have several $3000 withdrawls each month for 3 months with no explanation would look odd to the investigator.  Under oath you'd be asked why you took that money out.  
The attorney could subpoena your email address, and your computer to search for indications of fraud.  Perhaps they also go onto localbitcoins.com to see if any of the buyers on their recognize a photo of you and the seller could testify to the fact that they sold you coins, heck, they even have the blockchain info to prove it.  Maybe during the course of the BK the lawyer gets wind from that you are hiding assets and she remembers you saying something about bitcoin, so the lawyer puts a plant out locally to sell some coins to find you as the buyer.  
Way better to lose some money than to spend time in jail.

A question I asked on another post, but I'd love your input:
"What is to stop the following scenario: As a law abiding, tax paying citizen, I buy 100 coins on coinbase today for $500 per coin. Then immediatly sell these coins to my 'friend' who lives on a boat in international waters, but gave me his public address, for $500 per coin. There is no gain there (right).
Then X months later, I buy my coins from my friend for market value and immediately exchange them for goods/services at market value.
All of my transactions from cash to btc, and then from btc for goods/services were done at fair market value, but I had no realized gain or loss. right? My friend would, but that is his obligation to whatever entity he owes tax to. Right?
Now, say my 'friend' is not a human, but a boat with a computer, on it?  Or is a satellite orbiting our planet?  Or a cow with the QR code branded on their hide?"
I'm not trying to be argumentative, but it seems like these are obvious scenarios that don't even remotely break the law, but would result in a net-0 tax liability.  Why would everyone not do that?

I had fun.  About 2 weeks after I found out about Bitcoin I found out about BTC Gambling.  I figured it was a 100% scam, but fun is fun so I bet .01, and won.  It took about 30 minutes for each roulette spin to process and verify, so I never really played a lot, but enough.
One morning, I was about to head to work for a saturday (overtime) shift, and I decided I was going to go big.  I bet my entire shift's wages, so either I was going to work all day for free, or I was going to double it.
I left for work, feeling super anxious about how the bet would end up, and when I got to work, i checked, and I'd lost .2 BTC. SHIT.  Sonova.  God, why was I so dumb... etc. etc.  The whole day I was kind of down, and realized that the feel from losing was way more powerful than the thrill of winning.
End of the day I come home to my computer, and my BTC balance is .4.  It seems that I had mis-read the website that I'd bet on, and I'd actually won.  So, essentially I was taught the lesson of how much losing sucks, without actually having to lose.

When you sent them from coinbase, what you really did was tell coinbase to send your coins from their wallet that they control to bitlaunder.
Then bitlaunder sent the coins back to coinbase, but coinbase doesn't have any way to know that they are your coins.  What OP means to say is what you should have done differently is sent them from coinbase to a personal wallet running on your computer, and then from that wallet to bitlaunder.

It would be toxic if it was assessed as having a risk factor of N, when the risk of default on the underlying assets is more like, 10(N).  or 10,000(N).  
For instance, if I had a piece of paper (a contract), that said I'd trade you 1 gallon of gas for $3, but you could only redeem it between November and December of 2020.  You can buy as many of these 1 gallon for $3 coupons as you want, each of these coupons costs $5 per pack.  Today gas is worth $2.40.  So long as gas doesn't go above $3, I make money.  If gas goes above $3, you save money (make money).  You could buy 1,000,000 of these contracts.  I can sell them all day long, none of us actually have to buy gas, we settle in cash.  If gas stays around $3 (or less) I have no problem making good on the contract (paying you)... But if gas goes up to $15, or $100... or it runs out and you simply cant source new gas... then what?  Sounds bad, but wait... it gets worse.  these gas contracts, we packaged them up, just like they did back with home loans in 2006-2008... its a mess of interconnected risks, each one leveraging more and more upon the prior funds. 
But now, don't call it gas now, call it "DB_package_tranch405277832783_DBFund_8837rx9_teir-3"... how much is that worth... who knows... who can tell what is even inside of it, its a bunch of wizards in a tower, slapping value onto the side of it... its the emperor's clothes, but no one is calling the derivative-emperor naked... yet.

Imagine two worlds, one with regulated Electromagnetic specturm access, and one with free-for-all spectrum access?  Which would you rather live in?  I'm normally a smaller gov't is better type, but I'm on board with spectrum regulation.

Could it if the store ran their own node and offered free wifi to BRoadcast txs. The store could keep it in the mempool pending the next block that has room.
Slight modification... each store, or group of stores could share this load, it starts to sound like off chain settlement.  Each store could do so for a minimal fee, include it in any common store POS point of sale system.  Get too many fraudulent btc tx double spends, run your own node, and ask customers to send coins on your network.

I'd always thought it was, because "they" is 3rd person gender-neutral plural, where he is 3rd person masculine singular, and she is 3rd person femenine singular.  He or she would be proper, but languages change over time.  Non-english speakers... do you differentiate your 1st/2nd/3rd person, or gender pronouns?  
*edit, made statement reflect it was my impression this was the case, as it seems there is plenty of room for debate.

The "hacking of lost coins" currently has to describe the "guessing" of the private keys.  I forget the actual math, but it was something along the lines of if every star in the observable universe had a trillion earth sized planets, each full of sand, finding a GUESSED private key would be like finding the 'right' grain of sand in the universe.

I actually spun this wheel about 100 times.
I can't find the link anymore, but someone has a website that has a list of all public/private keypairs, that URL link to blockchain site that can tell you what their balance is.
I spent about 30 minutes hoping against hope for that 1 in a bajillion chance for that payoff.
I can't even find that website anymore, so I can't play anymore.  but it was like playing the lottery for free.

A court order can compel me to turn over my bitcoins just as easily as they can compel me to turn over the box of $100 bills i buried in my backyard.
Also, not turning over a private key (you can argue that a private key does not constitute testimony, and therefore doesn't warrant 5th amendment protections) when a court orders you to could result in contempt charges and jail time.  As long of the prosecution can show that you knowing where/how to access the btc is a matter of fact.

I spun "the wheel" several times, but landed only on unused addresses.  I was hoping to land on an address pair that had a [substantial] balance in it.

Except, I did it, like 50 times, so I'm practically guaranteed to win next time.  Right?

If you mined solo, you could possibly never make anything.  The network hashrate is about 7000 TH/S.  Most of these guys are pooled together to increase the chance that they 'stumble' upon the next right answer 1st.  Once someone finds the next right answer, everyone stops and starts looking for the next right answer.
The chances that your 200gh/s miner will find something before the rest of the world hashing 35,000 times faster than you is slim.  Sure, there is some chance you could get lucky, and get that 50btc reward... but it is unlikely.
The solution would be for you to become part of an existing pool.  When your pool finds a reward, you get a percentage of that pool.  It leads to more predictably frequent payouts.

The lack of chargebacks is one of the best features imho.  Obviously in OP's case, it sucks.  But having certain confirmation of a transaction with no doubts about it, is a huge advantage.

I had to fire-wall block bitcoin gambling at my router to help restrain me (i have a problem).  I started just .01btc and won fairly regularly, and dabbled in the .05 and .1 bets too.  I was up ~.25 btc when i decided i'd Bet a whole 0.2 btcs and WIN BIG.  
I spent all that morning on the drive into work anticipating checking the transaction when i got to work to see if I'd won.  I got in and checked, and it still hadn't posted.  I checked again and again waiting for it to update... Then i saw the next spin of the wheel and I lost.  The whole day sucked.
I felt awful, it wasn't more than I could afford to lose.  "It was just play money" i would tell myself, but i still felt dumb.  I got home after work, still depressed, and feeling bad.  I hadn't told my wife.  It wasn't like she'd be mad or anything, but it would be a dummy move.
I get home, sit down at my computer and lo-and-behold, I'd actually won.  I'd misread the charts when i got to work and I'd doubled my money.
Happy ending, i learned how much it sucks to lose, without actually losing.  And I blocked bitcoin roulette on my router to stop me from doing anything dumb again.

One gains knowledge by asking questions.  Share the knowledge.  If the question asked was, "I invested my life savings in bitcoin, and now i want to know what it is", you could ridicule, but this person is just trying to learn.
