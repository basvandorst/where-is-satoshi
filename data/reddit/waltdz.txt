I honestly can't tell if half these comments like yours are serious or not. You are either very good at sarcasm or very good at avoiding Reddit!

All I see is *******!

It's just a joke sorry to get your hopes up :(

Ok thanks I'll try them. Couldn't use glidera even if I wanted to because I couldn't get through the registration process within the bread app either...
Edit: of course for some reason I can't access gemini's exchange either right now! Is this a sign from the crypto gods

I'm hearing good things about BREAD app...you want to be sure you have the private key/paper wallet pass phrase. So sites like coinbase aren't good because you don't have access to that. But I'm just getting started too, so I'm also learning!

I don't think dice roll adds any additional security. As said, it's not about the unsolvability of the code by brute forcing - it's the fact they would physically have access to the literal code by stealing it. So the brain excryption (swapping letters, etc.) is the only true solution as it wouldn't exist physically at all. (Unless they torture you/mind-meld lol)
Generating your paper wallet/PK on a machine that has never been and will never be connected to the internet is just as secure as writing a dice roll on paper, and that way you don't have to sweep to network connected app.
At the same time, could there be some malicious code in the generator that could enable someone else to generate the same keys and somehow automate checking for/transferring balances?

I will report and thanks for the heads up. Is there a resource to research which of these investment sites are ponzi? Do trading bots even exist?

If your computer is already compromised paper wallet generated on it is not secure. Unless it's generated on a system that's never been connected to the internet you can't be sure.
That said, I agree with the idea that security should scale with the amount of bitcoins held because it makes adoption less daunting.
$10 - exchange or online wallet, small risk
$100 - something like bread or a paper wallet generated from the Internet
$1000 - hardware wallet
$10000 - airgapped paper wallet or something more secure that I don't even know about because I'm still new lol
That also means moving your coin as it increases in value, since a lot of people lost money that was at one time insignificant but grew over time after they forgot about it. 
Also, not sure about bread with the whole 2x thing. I think I will move to a paper wallet for now.

Ok cool that makes sense. But as far as my recursive acronym suggestion what do you think does it have legs or what 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:02:58
How do you read this kind of chart?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:16:09
Oh ok! Thanks that makes sense. If it's never connected to internet afterwards or during there's no way of data breach. Would that qualify as an airgapped machine then?

I love Bread but their position on 2x is unsettling because there is the potential for them to convert your bitcoin to 2x (do I have that right? Can anyone clarify)
Just to be safe I would move to a paper wallet temporarily and head to the Winchester for a pint until this all blows over.

Send a small amount to the wallet.
I'm also wondering if there's another way without having to potentially lose coin through the tx fee or if it doesn't work for some reason.

You forgot the /s because what you just said is a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:07:20
Oh I love that! I thought it was more an adopted misspelling like "teh" which is cool too because internet history.
What if we made it a recursive acronym like GNU so the first H actually stands for Hodl?? Funny right?
