Just a bit of feedback, there's no Btc/gbp in the list, but you have eth/gbp. Is this an oversight? Also the currency selection closes every few seconds (at least on mobile)

Thanks for the reply, it makes sense.  
But this means anyone who is looking to profit on the LN has a big headache of a problem to solve. They need to find some very generous party that are willing to lock up BTC for a long time - with seemingly no benefit to them.

I think you pick your own seed, though I've never bought a nano or trezor I don't think anyone would truly trust a pre-printed seed. There's no guarantee that no one saw it

I sold my white partyhat for bitcoin! It was back in august when bitcoin was about £3k. I managed to get just over half a coin for it, well worth it in retrospect!

I've seen a lot of people mention Johoe's site when the subject of how much to spend on fees comes up.   
They have received a few donations over the last few months, but the service they're providing to everyone is worth so much more.

I was in the exact situation a few days ago, though I was using electrum. I found that the subsequent transactions were not broadcast until the unconfirmed transaction was confirmed (even after a few hours they never appeared on the block explorer websites). I ended up bumping the fee of the stuck transaction which instantly deleted the 'queued' transactions, so I had to remake them. I'm not sure which aspects of this behavior is unique to electrum or if it's the block chain rules 
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:29:32
There's no such thing as an Electrum username. Electrum saves a wallet.dat file to your computer and then you encrypt it with your password. If you think your wallet.dat has been lost or overwritten that should be OK because Electrum forces you to write down your 12 seed words when you created the wallet. You can always re-create your wallet from those seed words.  
Once you're in, there is a tab which shows all of the addresses that electrum generated for you (there will be 10-20+). Finally check that the coinbase transaction was sent to one of those addresses in the list.

Can you elaborate as to how you tried and failed to recover from a seed?

If someone gives you an email / username, you can check that against a list of leaked passwords, which you can then attempt to use in every major crypto exchange. Got it.

I love that the polarity axis ranges from -1 to 0, implying that neutral sentiment is the best it gets

Ah, that's a really good one. I guess any time-bound event where you're expected to make multiple purchases fits the model quite well. Once you check out, you settle the balance.  
In a similar vein I can see Theme parks working too.

But don't you think it's wrong to advertise a low price, and then switch it to the real price just as someone is about to make the purchase?   
Even when you account for the Coinbase fee, you get less bitcoin than you're meant to, because they can't possibly respect a price that is so below the real market.

I like it, what decides the size of the panels?  
As for feedback, some of the tall + thin panels can be hard to read because of the continuous line breaks. I'm not sure how it could be resolved though. Hovering over them isn't too much effort I suppose

I used to play Runescape for several years (hence the name). There is a somewhat sketchy market for trading in-game items for Money / Paypal / Bitcoin.  
In mid 2017 I quit the game and sold all my items for over 0.5 bitcoin. It was the best way for me to stay anonymous.

They get publicity out of this. They're also unlikely to lose the funds unless they're careless.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:10:09
The public key is calculated with the private key. So actually if you lose your public key but knew your private key you can recover your funds

As the mempool cleared and exchanges started to consolidate their UTXO the number of UTXO will go down. A high amount of UTXO isn't necessarily good - it's a sign there's a lot of funds stuck.

Coinbase (specifically GDAX) is arguably the best options for people in the UK in terms of GBP-BTC conversion and how long it takes to get started.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:24:51
How long does it take for a transaction to get removed from the mempool? I didn't even know this could happen.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:00:06
I might have done a bad job at describing the situation. It's not a trader dumping anything, it's Coinbase adding hundreds of pounds to their 24 hour price graph. If I overlay the two graphs you'll see that they stay in sync right up until 1AM, at which point coinbase rockets up, and stays inflated throughout the day.

The bitcoins would be instantly spendable by the receiving node. They don't have to wait if they want to purchase something, or if they want to convert the coins to fiat currency using a lightning enabled exchange.  
If you want to go back on chain, perhaps to secure the funds in cold storage then the wait wouldn't matter so much.

I assume you're just trolling, but if not... Stating that bitcoin has changed +1.6% in the last 24 hours when it actually went -1.1% is extremely deceptive.

I don't understand what the big deal is. An address which has a high balance and has been actively transacting this year just sent 85,947 BTC to a new address. I would also imagine both the origin address and destination are owned by the same person.
