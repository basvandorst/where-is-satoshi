You have indeed done your homework, though $0.03 kWh is almost impossible to find these days due to supply/demand in Washington state due to influx of data-centers. The massive cooling costs for mining farms also drive up power usage. I know of no-one that pays under $0.06 per 1000W of mining equipment (including cooling). 
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:48:09

Another pointless class action lawsuit. When are people going to realize that when they pre-order products in development they are paying for DEVELOPMENT! Not booking an existing product.

I would argue that Bitshares have proven nothing to date, but that's a different discussion. And while you of course can argue that the hardware manufacturers are toxic, it is an industry driven by the consumer. If no one would have ordered from the manufacturers, then they would not be mining.

It's not about 'gambling' it is about using a Bitcoin address for which you do not control the private key as deposit address! No one should do it, and Coinbase are just following their security routines.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:34:15
The entire model of PoW and the investments therein secures the network.  Bitshares (and other coins just like it) are just offshoots that tries to solve a problem that does not exist. Once the mining reward trends towards zero in PoW mining will have as function to simply secure the transaction system and grown will naturally stagnate.

Are you perhaps referring to the Litecoin pumps and dumps that he supposedly orchestrated sitting on a large stack of coin?
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:37:04
Without access to large amounts of USD/EUR I actually think that establishing a bottom and giving yourself $12+ million to push price up with is a fairly decent idea. It instills trust in $300 bottom (wall eaten) and provides a large chunk of capital to the holder. Worst case, price keeps falling and whale buys back lower or simply sits on $12 million in capital. Remember, my 'theory' rests on the fact that he is a early adopter with 100k+ coin and he wants to stay anonymous so no OTC trades.

Bitshares is just the 'pump coin of the week', don't worry there will be a new one in a few days that 'Solves all the problems ever with everything'.

No. Money is saving your life. What has happened is that Bitcoin has started actually being treated as money. Which of course is AWESOME!

Because if we want main street adoption of BTC as a payment system, dark wallet is literally working against our own agenda by making lawmakers and companies see it as a 'crime currency'. 
Not saying dark wallet isn't great, but not a priority for 99% of the market.

I have one and it does what it's supposed to. Easy to use and store paper wallets on demand with open source backend.

KNC is not the only company with sponsored articles on Coindesk.com. You really cannot be gullible enough to think they don't do articles for payment..

Well look at that. Didn't see the comment.

Butthurt Dogecoiners that are somehow surprised that their copy-paste coin was copy-pasted.. Oh the irony..

The issue here goes much deeper as well. We all know that Cex.io (Ghash.io's partner) is running a completely rigged trading platform with no price correlation to actual buy and sells. I am pretty sure that this plays into their unwillingness to raise fees.
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:23:18
That was my first thought. ARS have been almost suspiciously Pro-KNC all through their issues and problems all the while attacking every other ASIC manufacturer. I'm not saying CoinTerra has done everything right, but it's par for the business and not by any means unique to them. From what I hear they are also processing refunds, though slowly.

It's gone up in price a little since 2010..

$40 million in Bitcoin, if sold over the open market to pay the fine could actually have contributed significantly to price drop over the last few weeks.

Both CS, Starcraft and DOTA2 is on the roadmap according to founders. They are a small company though so fastest way to get your favorite game integrated is for talented developers to use the API to create their own lobby!

The only thing brilliant here is raising 1700 BTC out of thin air.

Well, I think everyone realizes that at the center of all is greed. Which I can say that sometimes I think all the manufacturers are getting a bad rap. After all, the people orders (should) know by now it's a gamble. You are literally backing a development project, so what is surprising about not getting timely delivery?
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:45:57
Actually, probably a fairly fast way to get the clap...
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:26:11
I am mostly arguing that there are several ways of circumventing traditional consumer law when selling high value electronics in a highly experimental space. 
Claiming 'loss of profit' based on delays for example is almost certainly a fruitless argument. 
I would also argue that especially when it comes to larger contracts it is 100% viable to sell a product 'as is' or 'non refundable' if we are talking a development project. This is part of the reason why military budgets tend to never come in at target.

This is of course exactly what is going to happen. People will contact them with some random images of a 'broken box' and demand an immediate replacement and keep 6TH/s of mining power.

Following the address origin the cons are pre-2012 so it's fairly likely that he either mined them at extremely low difficulty or purchased them for sub $1 and very recently realized he had them, so I think 'finding' is pretty close to the experience. We are not talking a savvy investor here.

I have heard about that website and their tactic of of basically just extorting website owners to get off their list. I have never heard of anyone not getting paid out by casinobitco.in and their Bitcointalk history seems to agree. 
I also have no idea about 'needed my information' that the website talks about since i have used casinobitco.in and have never been asked for any identifying information. Seems 'Sam' is taking out of his ass.
Also wondering about " Every submitted report is thoroughly verified before being posted on the website. So you can rest assured that every SCAM report you read on this website is TRUE and VERIFIED." since none of the 'SCAM' accusations have any examples of why the site is a scam, just bad copy. 
Edit; Yeah, Bitcoinscamreview.com is ironically in itself 100% scam. Every 'review' is simple click bait and bad SEO to get hits from 'bitcoin scam casino' and no proof exists of any of the accusations.

Of course it's highly unethical to 'burn in' for longer than say 24 hours. That is however not the same things as illegal and a stupid thing to focus on in my opinion.

If you post links to sources that require registration you should be banned. Period.

Even if Bitcoin becomes the predominant currency paper money will still be used for a VERY long time. Cash becoming obsolete is still many years away.

Bro, you obviously have no damn clue about the legal framework of consumer law. If you are in the US and they are in the EU there is exactly NOTHING you can do about late delivery of your NON REFUNDABLE product purchase.
This community crap is also just stupid since everyone signed the same Terms of Service (non refundable product! doh..) and the only reason anyone is unhappy is greed.

Official leetcoin.com representative is commenting in the thread.

I hope so! Would be a lot of fun playing the Bitcoin community. Another perk is that at least in theory, it's legal within the US as it is considered skill based gambling as opposed to casino games.
