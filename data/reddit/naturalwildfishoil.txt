also many people have become millionaire with crypto but that has nothing to do
the truth is that Bitcoin is the best way to save value today, better than the peso, the dollar and even better than gold
what happens is that the people who print the money (at their whim) do not want competition

 1 mil btc makes logical sense for a variety of reasons. Do you think on mars trade will be done in $ usd or yen and not satoshi’s??
The harder argument would be trying to explain why 1 million united states dollars wouldn’t equal atleast 1 bitcoin. it will probably take 3-9 more years
