Great to see that. Maybe environmentalists could actually try and increase this, rather than combat crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:15:00
Yea. 
No facebook, no instagram and other time-killers. No bragging and asking for crowdfunding. Only hard work and a lot of time invested in something they believed it. 
But welcome to 2018.

You blew it hard here. 
No one wants to hear about the stock market. That's the reason why some of the people are here in the first place, to escape from that centralized place where hedge funds and investors with billions win - while others collect what remains besides them. 
Just because Bitcoin is stagnating it shouldn't mean we should move to stock markets. I can't even understand how would you think about that.

Volatility? Not really. 
This is actually booooring. No grand decline or growth, only a few 1-2% increase or decrease per day. Feels like the stock markets.

I wish I have some of that Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:21:35
This is nothing new and I don't think this happen only in China. 
Its a general problem that we need to understand and find a solution to it. Bitcoin is one of them, but hard to use by non-technical people. Plus, there are scams almost everywhere. But on the other hands, the bank scams you upfront with some high fees. Its up to the user what decides: 
a) Keep his money in bank and pay the fees
b) Keep the money in BTC and deal with volatility

Thanks for the tutorial!
 I recommend you to put that in a file on Google Drive or similar and help the people that have this issue from Quora or other similar website.

And if you own like 1 million of them, you're probably Satoshi Nakamoto.

Its hard to implement this technology now. It will take a lot of time and work and 100% the people behind it will find a way to benefit from it. So, there's not such a need for it there, especially if people can't manipulate the votes as they wish. 
Plus, they'd need to educate a lot of people. People not familiar with technology and the process will take a long, long time.

They barely do. They got the first profit in February this year, I think.  Check their stock evolution, it says a lot about Twitter and their poor management. They will probably be called ' Yahoo  in a few years.

Its amazing to see that the network hash rate is growing even with this decline in price. This means that some people  see the potential of it and decide to go long term.

Good for you for not being a "weak hand" and believing in the project. 
Now go and read more about it to see it will really be 8 grand again. Really. Everything is about documenting yourself. 
People that catch Mt.Gox's fall were probably asking if it will be $1,000 ever again.
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:24:27
You forgot about "Bit Coin" 
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:27:59
Great, so its time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 09:01:55
Use DuckDuckGo. especially for crypto. way better.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:55:58
Usually, that's a good sign for the price and also for the miners. Let's see if this one would be the same.

In 2018 maybe. Last year was a complete mess.

Didn't know you can buy coke without seeing a creepy guy in a parking lot at 2AM.

This scam never gets old. 
Saw an address that received around $1000 in a day doing this. I wasn't even feeling sorry for the people falling for it. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 14:51:10
Oh well, sounds perfectly trustworthy. 
10/10 would let him install a miner on my PC.

Hey, I think it would be better if you use imgur for creating a list like this. It would help us to look trough it easier. 
Thanks, have an upvote for the hard work!
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:25:08
But they don't block the thousands of accounts impersonating Elon Musk and scamming people. Amazing!

I don't know what you smoked, but I don't want some.

For more, actually. Paid for some services a while ago, the company worked with CEX.io to exchange the funds and didn't require a +1 -2% because of the rate. In case the price would drop over the next half an hour, it would be their loss. That was amazing! 
And another one that worked with Coinbase or a similar service that wanted +5% in the BTC price. The product was around $700 and the normal price was around $650 - so they were asking for around 12% for paying with crypto - which was insane. 
Also used it to gamble, there are some sites that gives you 10-20% instant bonus upon deposit is you pay with crypto. 
The improvement? Tell your favorite merchant to implement Bitcoin. Show them how and why it would be a great idea. Make them understand that there's a need for that. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:46:19
Probably 0 because you would have kept those on Mt.Gox.

How did this pass the spam test?

Not one of them, but have an italian friend who did. 
He was passionate about cryptography and codes that cannot be decoded since 2005. He found out about Bitcoin in late 2010 from a forum he was reading at that time. Decided to mine a bit for fun, then to buy some and so on. Sold them at a nice profit at the time and kept some on a paper wallet that he put in a book. 
Focused on other projects, moved to another city and found out about it again in 2017. Good news? Bitcoin was over $4,000 at the time. Bad news? His wife sold most of his books as he 'wasn't much of a reader'.
PS The book was 'Divina Commedia'. It cracked me up when he told me.  
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:01:57
I don't see a need for that. I think we have bigger issues that we need to solve first. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:38:40
He may be right, but I'd rather drag my balls trough broken glass than follow his 'tips'. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:51:50
True, but there are some people that are traders - not HODLers. Leave eToro for them. 
PS Even if I don't really like eToro so much - their new ad is amazing. [HODL](
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:36:40
And store it on the Mt.Gox. Right?
