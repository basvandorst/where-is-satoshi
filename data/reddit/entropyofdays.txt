I have said many times that the adult industry will play a major factor in consumer adoption, as they have with other consumer technologies.
In fact, a couple of weeks ago I talked to a couple of fellows at the Bitcoin Center who have porn industry vets on board to create an alt-coin from scratch specifically for the adult entertainment industry (none of that 'sex-coin' abomination). I wasn't interested because I run an above-the-neck business, but you can be sure that it's in the works.

I was hoping you'd say that. We *don't* need another web wallet. We *do* need well-designed software wallets.

Is this a modification of the QT wallet? (looks to be so, based on the placing of the tabs)
I think it looks gorgeous; clean and elegant. I believe that easy-to-approach aesthetics are going to be key to driving consumer adoption.

I disagree. 
1. The transaction fees would only have to increase with lower block rewards only if adoption stayed static. With widespread adoption, miners can make up the income by economy of scale. There's no extra computing cost for processing extra transactions, only a computing cost pegged to the scaling difficulty of the network, so the economics of being a miner in the 'post-miner' bitcoin network will depend on what happens to the network hash-rate after the block reward halves a few more times. We don't even have to worry about another halving until 2017, at which point scaling adoption should give us a good indication of transactional income.
2. Exchanges already implement KYC/AML with a lesser associated overhead than banks. Why? Because their KYC/AML isn't built on top of an aging infrastructure. Even if Coinbase isn't federally-compliant (yet), you can be sure that they are doing their due diligence for KYC/AML. My intuition is that with exchange competition (there are a bunch of exchange startups in the US getting VC funding right now), we'll see the creation of more sophisticated, automated KYC/AML that will decrease overhead (especially as the result/consequence of the reporting mechanisms being written to deal with current IRC guidance)
3. This is a non-starter. We already have built-in escrow by way of 2-of-2, 2-of-3 multisig addresses. There's no need for institutional escrow anymore; all two trust-less parties need is a third-mediator who doesn't have any of the overhead of having to actually hold the funds/goods being escrowed, and they only need to mediate in the case of dispute resolution (which you can't factor into the cost of a simple transaction).
4. You're right, but you can rent penthouses in NYC with bitcoin, so who knows?

In a system that engenders competition by it's distribution, when has a service ever held coercive power over a consumer? There's a reason why services and utilities are broken up across America into de-facto monopolies; otherwise, consumer choice would create competition and drive service-appropriate pricing. By the relatively stochastic nature of hashing and the distribution of blocks, it would require miners/mining pools colluding together to push TXfee prices up. There is **no** mechanism for a miner to **demand** higher transaction prices; likewise, there is **no** need for a consumer to **pay** higher transaction prices. What you pay for is ostensibly speed toward the first confirmation.
The 'race to the bottom' is the story of bitcoin mining, and it will continue along that trajectory, especially as ASIC design reaches the limit of 5nm chip fab in the next decade. After that, there are no more gains to be had, and network hash-rate should stabilize. 
And, yes, many expect that [algorithms and software will soon replace labor]( in the [legal sector as well]( Some radical solutions, such as [universal basic income]( are being proposed, which would render the employment rate irrelevant.
If a computer can do a better job faster and with more efficiency than a human counterpart, I reject the notion that we should hold on to anachronistic notions of employment. For what, nostalgia?

1. In which case, your argument is such that every miner must get 'x' income, and will demand transaction fees to compensate for increased competition. The thing is that miners can't coerce transaction fees. A pool can prioritize including a transaction in a block based on transaction fee, but they can't demand the inclusion of 'such-and-such' fee for a transaction. Transactions are broadcast to the network with or without a fee included and are picked up; miners don't create a contract for processing with fees. Considering how non-trivial a double-spend is once a transaction is broadcast (even if it's not confirmed by a block; remember that miners and other clients will reject spent TXIN), waiting for a confirmation is *not a big deal*.
2. I do disagree with this statement. There is no guarantee that the 'cost' of compliance won't be subject to the same technical solutions we already see in the Bitcoin sector. This is a known unknown.
3. Multisig escrow is safer than extant escrow because it's mostly trustless; the escrow party cannot run away with escrowed assets, unless colluding with one of the other parties. It's trivial to implement a 3-of-3 multisig, which prevents collusion.
Multisig is already being wrapped up in a pretty and consumer-friendly package. Why do you think that such a solution is not relevant to 'non-geeks'. When you create a monetary protocol, you likewise create the possibility of an application layer that abstracts the use of that protocol.

I post as [RPConsulting]( (formerly EntropyExtropy).  I wouldn't call myself a must follow, but I update on a lot of what's going on in the NYC bitcoin scene.

Don't pounce of them too hard. I'm still active with Quark, as are many people. We're still doing what we can do. That's what we owe to the people who put their money in quark. While I'm astounded at the blind jingo-ism who think their brand of 'x' can't do anything wrong, there's nothing wrong with trying to defend something you're working on/for/towards.

I'm hijacking the top thread just give my 2 cents. I became a dev of Quark two weeks ago because I wanted to help turn that ship around. A lot of honest people put their money into Quark at Bill Still's direction and I thought that it could be saved.
I pushed for an audit of the blockchain ( and what we've found ( is incredibly disheartening. We lost a very dedicated member because he became convinced, like I have, that, not only are the fundamentals flawed, but the development, or lack thereof, of the project has been carried out in a very, very shady way.
I went to bat for the Quark project not because I believed that what Kolin was saying was true, but because I was willing to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, all of the quantifiable metrics have proven it to be just as it is. And it saddens me to say that, but it also bolsters my resolve because the community came together to, a) fix what could be fixed, b) prove what should be proved regardless of project allegiance.
Unfortunately, there is no 'fixing' the Quark project. Both Kolin and Max have disappeared again. 
I want to point out that there's no problem with having alternate cryptocurrencies. If anything, the crypto-development community must mirror the Linux development community; forks and small projects experiment with features that the mainstays (in this case, Bitcoin) can't because of their industrial adoption. Cryptos are a good thing; scams and pump-and-dumps are not.
To reiterate another subject I've been outspoken on, the cryptocurrency development community is currently transitioning between amateurs tinkering with hobbyist code to professional development teams releasing and supporting a product. This is the nature of the beast when the product you develop is money; when people invest their money in your product, you become morally and economically beholden to supporting that product. Crypto development **has** to forego the current amateurish production values and in-fighting if there is ever going to be a hope of validity in the eyes of the established business ecology. That's not to say that cryptos can't be a radical force for equity and change in the world, but at the end of the day, *someone* has to use your product, *someone* has to accept it in lieu of fiat, and you have to navigate the juridical and political frameworks that are going to provide the context for the world you're working in. Cryptos right now are lightly legislated; in a year, I doubt the same will hold true. And developers are going to be the ones on the hook for that. It is for *this* reason, if no other, that I have slightly distanced myself from the Quark project, because all attempts at solidifying forward momentum into a professional, functional development trajectory failed.
It is also for this reason that I'm of the firm opinion that cryptos must be *transparent*, but that's another conversation altogether.
edit: I'm willing to talk more in depth to people about these issues should they want.
edit edit: I also want to say that the community came together in an astounding way to kickstart development, only to be, if not in word than in action, rebuffed by kolin and Max. The folks over at the quark forum have dedicated an inordinate amount of time on a volunteer basis doing what should otherwise be paid development (in PR/Branding/Graphics/Bug fixing) and it's an absolute shame that none of the 'large holders' of quark came out of the woodwork to support them. That says something.
edit edit edit: Following this post, my account on the quark forum and my access to private quark project forums was rescinded, a move that could only be mad by Max. Keep it professional, Max.
