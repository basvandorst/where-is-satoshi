I use paper wallets. My method is more old-school and complicated but I have not been hacked so far.
- Download a paper wallet generator (like  and save it to a USB
- Download and install Tails (
- Boot your machine using Tails and plug in USB with wallet generator
- Generate paper wallets on Tails
- Save PDF files of wallets in a TrueCrypt 7.1a container
- Save container to a USB / Upload to Dropbox or Google Drive or send it to yourself via email for backups.
I think my coins are safe using this method, and I sleep well at night. 
Furthermore, I split the TrueCrypt container's password into multiple "secrets" that I've given to different people. If I were to pass, my folks will have enough "secrets" to reconstruct the password and access the Bitcoin.
It's complicated and a pain in the ass, but it's a fair price to pay for more safety and autonomy.

I haven't read much on BitCache (not a lot of info available atm) or seen anyone mention this, but wouldn't this also be a way to handle DRM for legit content?
I own a movie, that movie is tied to a bitcoin tx and only I can access it. I can then lend it to a friend, sell it, etc...
This could be a pretty cool way to distribute content for indie filmmakers / content creators.
All I see is talk about scalable bandwidth, but I don't see that as a very exciting feature.

Anyone can fork Ethereum so its cost/utility ratio is questionable in the long run. Why would I use Ethereum to process a smart contract at $X if someone forks Ethereum Cash Classic Gold and lets me do it at a lower cost? It's a utility blockchain, not a store of value blockchain like Bitcoin.
Mining incentives will get all out of whack with PoS, where entering as a miner will require purchasing tokens from a previous owner. Sounds more and more like a ponzi.

With Ethereum switching its mining to Proof of Stake, how would that work? There is no more hashrate in that scenario, and forking is essentially costless at that point.
Besides, if hashrate and networks are what counts, Bitcoin's RootStock (RSK) may be a better alternative, no?
At this time, I can't think of many things that I need secured and made immutable by a high hashrate, besides money / a store of value. But that may change. 
I'm still not convinced there's a market willing to pay premiums for something they could fork and run just as well (kind of happening already with private corporation forks of Ethereum, Proof of Stake will only make this easier).

I like the project, and they seem serious about it – but I see two major issues with Monaco.

- Regulators will have no problem taking it down once they decide they don't like it.

Silk Road removed violence from selling and buying drugs. Whether you approve of drug use or not, the reality is that many people engage in those type of trades. Removing the violence factor was a net positive for the world. 
While there is some evidence that Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) did hire a couple hitmen, there is no evidence that it was Ross himself. DPR was a moniker used by the site admins, Ross wasn't the only one. That accusation was only brought up in court to tarnish his image, he was never convicted for it (because there is no evidence). 
The people fighting the war on drugs are the ones who belong behind bars.
Ross is a genius, not a criminal.

Schnorr signatures come to mind. CoinDesk did a pretty nice writeup on what that entails: 
SegWit was a first step to allow all these new solutions to work, so we should focus on getting exchanges and wallets to support it in order to speed up its adoption. LN is pretty cool though, and already has 3 separate implementations by 3 different teams. Network congestion should drop progressively as these solutions are rolled out to more users, but it won't happen overnight.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:22:16


None of these alts would exist if it wasn't for Bitcoin. Easy to criticize it when it's the Bitcoin devs doing all the work of figuring things out and standardizing cryptocurrency technology (i.e Schnorr signatures).

Is anyone forcing these people to do drugs? No, it's their own choice.
Silk Road provided a review system and relied on seller ratings. It was much safer than buying fucking fentanyl-laced shit off the streets. THAT'S how people die from drug use, so fuck right off your high horse and don't try to pretend you care about their safety. 
Ross is a brilliant mind, you can easily find proof of that by doing a little research on the guy. He would do far more good for society as a free man than locked up in a cage.
There was no human trafficking or other fucked up shit that actually caused harm to human beings on Silk Road.

I don't think anyone here expected the SolidX ETF to be approved, so the price drop is just speculators selling the news and trying to make waves. It didn't drop much, it's oscillating in the same range.
BU isn't much of a threat to anyone paying attention to what's going on. Considering the recent developments, a hard fork is more and more unlikely.
Regarding China, I haven't really been following. The POBC's visit to exchanges last month did show that the Chinese were mostly gambling with Bitcoin on fee-free exchanges, and volume was artificially pumped. So maybe what happens in China doesn't matter much anymore?

Agreed. Not too worried about the price, I don't think the ruling changes much as far as Bitcoin is concerned.

Sure you can. You can sweep the funds (using the private key associated with your cold storage address) to a wallet and spend them. All you need to do is to scan a QR code.

On a separate note, this morning my mother (who lives in France) said she spotted a Bitcoin "thing" at the local "Bureau de tabac" (they're small stores that sell magazines, cigarettes and lottery tickets, etc... at just about every street corner in France).
She said the Bitcoin logo appeared on some touch screen in the shop. She asked if they accepted Bitcoin as payment, and the store owner had no idea what she was talking about at first, and then said he didn't know what it was exactly because they hadn't received their training yet. 
I'm guessing it's some kind of ATM or a system to refill prepaid cards. 
I hope to find out more soon, but it's pretty exciting considering it's not in a big city and these stores are everywhere and all carry the same stuff.

The app sends the seed to a third-party server, it wasn't a keylogger. It shouldn't do that, neither does it need to.

In addition to a written backup (preferably split into 2 or 3 parts and stored in separate locations), you could use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) to encrypt and store your word seed.
SSS let's you create multiple "shards", and select a number of shards to combine in order to recreate the original message. You can store these shards on separate USB keys and distribute them to friends and family members for backup.
That way if your house burns down, you can recover your seed from these keys.
 is one implementation (download the site and run it on an air-tight/offline computer if you decide to use it).

I love Richard Heart, but his bearishness was pretty pathetic after predicting $20k last year. Watching his stream was essentially watching him cry about how alts were the future and Bitcoin was dead and he got screwed.
For someone that was pumping Bitcoin a few months ago, it was pretty shortsighted of him.
I still follow him pretty closely, he has some really good content on YouTube and I enjoy his perspective on things other than Bitcoin, but take his cryptocurrency advice with a grain of salt. No one knows where Bitcoin is headed, you'll always be your best judge.
I know people who sold BTC at $500 in 2015 when it was climbing back up and never bought back - so take solace in knowing others have screwed up way more.

Then don't use a centralized exchange?

Not an excuse. They knew this was coming, and they've been shitting the bed every time for years. There comes a point where excuses don't work anymore, and we're there.
*Would you keep using Amazon if they went down anytime there was a sale on a item? Hell no you wouldn't. That's their loss. Coinbase knows they have server issues, but they didn't address the problem.

Fair enough. At the end of the day, their company's inability to scale and meet customer growth has cost me $$$$ – multiple times.
After several years of doing business with them, I expected their systems to improve. That is apparently not the case.
Gemini didn't seem to have any issues during the dump, so I'll be taking my business there until Coinbase gets their shit together.

Their platform constantly goes down for hours when the price crashes... it's been happening for years.

This is SO good. Well done. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:08:53
Ah, so it is possible! That's good to know, thanks.

Depends on how tech savvy and comfortable you are doing this. But a Tails disc, a paper wallet generator downloaded from Github onto a USB, and a Truecrypt volume is how I use to do it before finally getting a hardware wallet.

Looks like an interesting read, I ordered it. Thanks again!

It's amazing how many people still think any new coin can just outperform and overtake Bitcoin. That ship sailed over 5 years ago.

Doesn't solve the buy/sell issue...

My 65 sat/byte transactions took 6 days to confirm (it was large, 1000+ bytes). Definitely not reliable. But I wasn't about to pay $180 for a tx...

I see you're just as much a scientist as you are a philosopher.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:53:26
Correct. Also, why can't buy a fraction of a stock? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:27:01
Kind of sucks they're only reimbursing ETH/USD though. Guess you're a second-tier customer if you trade with Euros. 
Can you spell B-A-I-L-O-U-T again?

Because he's an asshole?

Yes, you will be serialized and tracked so you don't accidentally money-launder yourself.

As the inventor of hashcash (which Bitcoin uses), he's slightly more important than what you're suggesting.

It's been sharting for the past week. Shart-ICOs clogging the bowl. Needs a plunger.

It's a real psychological barrier for some, which I think is why other coins have been pumping like crazy lately. Normies don't look at the value-proposition, just the price in hopes their coin will reach unattainable heights.
They'll get burned eventually.
