The most obvious advantage being: you can trade BTC/GUSD without an exchange. Just change back and forth using tradingview charts, keeping both safely in your chosen wallet. Provides an exit for traders. It's useful as flarck!

But, responding to your original query, if you use cloud storage to store an encrypted file, it's as safe as the two layers are which are protecting it, in this case, the strength of security of the cloud service itself, and the strength of the password you use to encrypt the file. Some password which are over 12 characters long include capitals, numbers and special charters would take centuries to crack. So you'd be fine unless quantum computers are ever perfected.

IMHO I think using a paper copy of a wallet is absolutely frakking insane. Just get KeyPass and put your seed words in an encrypted file with a high difficulty password. Send it to yourself by secure mail, keep it in the cloud, whatever. If someone finds a password scribbled in the edge of a notebook, they have a password to a file they don't know exists. If they find a bunch of seed words, it's pretty instantly apparent that they've just found a shitload of money.

Apologies, I didn't mean to be so rude. I just wanted to suggest using Keepass, which is a software password manager, to store your keywords and passwords. That way you don't need a hardcopy. You just need to remember a weird password, and maybe have that written down and stored safely. You can email all the wallet details in a highly encrypted file.

I'd rather my grandma doesn't keep her own keys. She already lets any old youngin' in the hood help her with opening the door when she got the groceries.

I bought it because I wanted to sell drugs at 1.3k, then saw it go up to 3k in a few days and decided it was more profitable and less risky to simply hold and trade bitcoin.

No, they just spend unconscionable amounts of money on clothes that look "poor" but in truth are made "prestressed" by Armani, et al., and cost thousands.  
Of course, they don't buy this stuff for themselves, though, their image consultants buy it all for them.
