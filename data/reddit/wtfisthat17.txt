Dont transfer in BTC like period. Unless you have to. It takes a fucking CENT (1 penny) to trade like 20$ of LTC and less than 10 minutes. Try that with BTC you're paying 5$ fees minimum and waiting 15-20 minutes and if its a shitty hour that could be 30-45 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:02:43
Why the fuck are people still screwing around with BTC... Ffs the fees are so stupid its completely un-usable as an actual currency. Nobody in their right minds will pay these exorbitant fees to go grocery shopping. Stupid as hell. GO TO LTC 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:38:36
Like a millionaire ?  Ive only been in crypto for a few days.. but I can only imagine lol.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:07:22
I havent honestly transferred LTC lately but Im sure its exponentially cheaper. And Im positive it took less time then your (or any of mine for that matter) BTC transaction. Takes 20 minutes for BTC and like &lt;5 for LTC. Soooo... yea ��
EDIT: Yea I just checked. It literally takes .00000309 BTC (.000226 LTC) or 1 CENT to transfer a little more than 15$ LTC from coinbase. Im pretty sure It would take less than 10 minutes for it to go through as well. Soo LTC = faster and exponentially cheaper. I understand the fees arent nearly as bad for larger BTC transactions but seriously, anyone thats like me that isnt a few hundred dollars (atleast) into BTC is gonna be hurting from those fees. BTC is literally as "useless" as gold, it has little use as anything but a way for whales to keep their crypto balances safe.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:24:58
I dont recommend investing any amount of money into altcoins until you have a pretty extensive knowledge and enough knowledge to make reason for buying into one, but I have noticed that while BTC is constantly making all these "all time highs" only weeks apart it is not nearly enough time for some of the cheaper altcoins to adjust. So basically when trading BTC for an alt coin, you can get more of said alt coin by trading BTC for it if it still hasnt gone up with the price. 
Im probably doing a horrible job of explaining what Im trying to. I bet the alt coin market is a good forex trader's absolute dream... 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:29:03
Im still cringing. Stupid analogy is stupid. Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:06:29
Why btc at all??? That shit is expensive it should be going downhill. LTC is still cheap and easy to transfer, basically no fees compared to btc and has value. I dont understand why btc is even going up anymore 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:33:02
What kind of analogy is this supposed to be? It doesn't make much sense.. cringe.

Get a wallet and own your own keys, you'll get some weird shit like dividends over the years. Crypto trying to mirror the stock market I think its absurd but still, own all of your private keys (dont keep it on an exchange)
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:12:53
I'll try make it easy for you bro..
VTC is a good price RN.
XRP is cheap, but honestly I wont touch it with an 8 and a half foot long pole. Fuck that shit. 
Cant go wrong with some Doge coin
Some more expensive coins
LTC - Ive held 1 LTC since 42$ (I have limited funds.. My entire stake in crypto is about 120$, it would be less if I hadnt bought LTC when I did)
XMR (manero), big privacy coin.
Couple others I cant think of off the top of my head. Just pay attention to market caps, thats more important than the individual price.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:09:11
Im agreeing with you.. And I hate how fucking nosy reddit is. Anyone Think Im really only 3 weeks old? I dont know why post history matters when 99% of the time the posts are completely unrelated in any way to the discussion. Just something that doesn't happen nearly as often on any other forum Ive been to compared to reddit.
I think very low of anyone that brings up anothers post history in an argument. Lowest thing you can resort to (unless the post is actually relevant to the discussion, again 99% of the time that is not the case)
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:56:02
Sorry. Have to remember their are people like you who actually dont listen to everything their told. Best of luck. Maybe add a discussion flair or something (if thats possible) seems your seeking that more than actual advice.

Im sure he does, and thats why I think its still worth a read. But not because of his past predictions to something pretty unrelated to crypto, as the headline suggests.

Dude it tells you on their site it will take a couple days. Add a credit card for instant buys. Banks take a while to process ACH transactions. Amazing how many people cant read. It literally says it will take a couple days everytime you buy with your bank account.

Its the dude who bought a pizza all these years ago, that bad decision converted into good Karma and he won the lottery today.
Really though Is there a screen shot? I believe it but just for kicks I wanna see that in the market history. And did he get every bit of it at 3620? I dont watch bitcoin much but the biggest sell wall Ive ever seen was something like 1 or 2 mill $USD worth of XRP on Polo (was probably more since BTC was &gt;$4,000 and it was like 300-400 BTC at the time). If one or a few entities just got 10m of their crypto instantly bought on an exchange I cant imagine how they'd feel. Imagine withdrawing that much FIAT? I hope they get paid timely too. (Also I assume this mustve happened on GDAX, because the fees would have been stupid high otherwise)

Had to re-read that, sounded like you meant you'd sell your BTC and then your home to buy more BTC lol Id sell some shit if it went to $2k also 
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:19:13
China made you sell your bitcoin? I really feel bad if you got stopped out but if you sold willingly you can fuck yourself*
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:59:35
Lol, no need to apologize. But tbh I feel you, like a lot of the time I have to restrain from engaging in the content here. Its really a double edged sword between fun and entertainment and seriousness and the fact people are heavily invested in this stuff. I think you may appreciate the ripple sub reddit more than this one, if your interested in learning the more financial side of things. For whatever reason people with previous trading experience in things like stocks flock to ripple like geese. Probably due to extremely successful marketing, which tbh if your Ripple, you could hire a monkey to do your marketing and be extremely successful. 
But If your more into the tech good luck learning anything here without effort. Better off wading through white papers and crypto developer sites.

This is essentially the goal of a good forex trader. Im glad I learned what forex was before getting into the altcoin market. Its literally identical strategys just near complete different market factors. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:47:43
Some exchanges make it easy to trade BTC without much verification. Poloniex I believe only requires the last 4 of your social, and a phone number to start trading and be able to withdraw BTC (no FIAT). If you want to trade FIAT however thats where sites start requiring things like address and photo ID to avoid Credit Card fraud.
So if your just wanting to trade crypto, you should have no problem with no photo ID. I wouldnt go to sites where your buying and selling directly from a 3rd party unless you want to cash your BTC out for fiat.

Hmm.. I know what LN is essentially and that it solves scalability but Im still extremely confused. I dont get how whats being shown in the video has anything at all to do with LN.

I digress a bit, their not “20x” the hassle, but all these garbo atomizers everyones glorifying are not as great as their being made out to be.. Most will last a week at best, while the cotton degrades in a matter of days as does the flavor.. The only thing I enjoy is an RDA with any kind of flatwire coils (I use “catterpillar” coils) and it works great but is a pain to maintain as opposed to tearing some plastic and lighting up. Again, Im NOT justifying tobacco or saying the maintenence of an ecig isnt worth the obvious benefit. Im just arguing that 


isnt a viable answer to tobacco products imho. Unless your a non smoker here to shame people who actually smoke. Which Im guessing atleast half of you commenting here have never even touched a ciggarette which is good but annoying that you think you know anything.

@_date: 2017-09-04 20:22:43
I meant market caps for individual coins. Each coin has its own "market cap" which is basically determined by the amount of coins in circulation vs the price per coin. This is important because the amount of coins in circulation varys greatly. Its why XRP is top 5 coin by market cap and less than 50¢ per coin. 
While ETH and other top 5 coins are worth up to or over a hundred/few hundred.

@_date: 2017-09-16 21:30:26
Sorry that was kind of FUD I have to admit.. Even if BTC hit 2k$ it would not stay there for long. I just have this ominous feeling in my gut that what happened yesterday was just the market around China reacting. China has a few more weeks til their exchanges close. I doubt the majority have sold yet.. Some will wait for a better price some will wait until the last hour and some might even hold regardless. BTC is not recovering right now, its pending. It will Recover after China leaves or go up into another Bubble if they dont.

Dude, you guys new to crypto, need to download the forex app! There is one that allows you to trade fake currencies for practice, Im not saying you need to learn forex, but the app has an outstanding tutorial on the basics for things like candlestick charts.

I know Im probably not the only one to ever mention this.. but this comment is getting old. E cigs are 20x the effort than a pre-rolled/packed cigarette.
