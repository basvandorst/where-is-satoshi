Its like this.
Customer gives shop owner some bitcoin(s).  Those bitcoins creates credit from that customer until further notice.
All the time that the customer is in credit he get cofee until his credit runs out.
Apps are for machines. We are human.

The negotiations for the transaction should be processed by humans rather than automated processses.  
You might make a link that formats an email message as an invoice.  With a bitcoin payment string ready for the customer to manually make the payment using thier own software.

The official who has been given the job of recovering USD from confiscated bitcoins had better know what they are doing.
Dumping into one exchange would create an artificially low price.  You might be accused of profiting from your own imcompetence.

The power of bitcoin is removing the tyrany of payment fees.  The idea is that payments cost nothing to process.
Transaction fees are dead.

Gox may be forced to act in compliance with orders from the people who hold thier assets.

You could have an account with a well know bitcoin exchange and have two yubikeys linked to the account.

In holding the assets of Gox, the American government is extracting compliance with thier agenda.  
Solvency is not the issue, independance is.

Then I want the Fat man to sing.  And sing out just exactly what is going on.

How about the Movie of "Reamde" by Neal Stephenson.
A virus blackmails gamers to pay a ransom in virtual currency.
Not bitcoin but It might as well be.

Do you think these are the comissions for relaying transactions faster ?
Not a very popular option to enable for most users.  THink Gox wanted to make it compulsary.
