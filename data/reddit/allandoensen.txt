(1) I do not think it would be too expensive for the attack, the state actor does not need to by all the blockspace, they just buy enough to inflate the fees into an unusable value. People still have to send. 
(2) This attack makes even more sense if you are amalicious miner with significant hash power - as you get paid back in the fees that you are increasing. 
(3) This is about an issue with BTC. It has nothing to do with bcash.
(4) Should not core investigate this sort of thing and look to finding a solution for this sort of generic attack?

Groundhog day: It is 2014 all over again....you had the halveing in 2012 &amp; in 2016, then the bubble that pops in early 2014 &amp; 2018....it is just supply and demand re-adjusting...come back and buy some more in 2020 during the halving when the smart money does it; you could then have your lambo by 2022.

memory too short it is...look at 2014 for guidance.

If coinbase can do this with incompetence, imagine what a state actor can do to bitcoin with malicious intent....
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:09:07
How high would fees need to get for you to consider it broken? And could a state actor do that using the same method?

links to the court docs and btc addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:47
this.

And you cannot move the tokens out of finex till the split...so finix can just nick your BTC like they have in the past. I smell scam here. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:36:11
Just wait 2 weeks and you will be paying 3 times higher anyway. Welcome to the world of exponential fee increases.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:43:29
If you sell your BCC or BCU back for BTC, yes you can move the BTC off...then you are back were you started, holding BTC before the split.
I find it interesting that BCC+BCU &gt; BTC by around $40. The sum of the parts is worth more then the whole.

Even if the code was ready to go today, there is still the issue of merchant adoption. In bitcoin the adoption process has taken 8 years to get to now - LN will need to duplicate that and it will be a slow process as well. You cannot just flip the switch to vaudeville on this one.  
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:31:54
I read a lot of code, and I write a lot of code, it is what I live for. My observations are based on my deep technical study of the topic and my 30+ years of development experience. They are a very sound observations and I do believe they will stand the test of time. But instead of deriding my technical expertise, how about you take a position on the actual question posed? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:57:25
To clarify, I mean LN will not be used by the average bit-coiner before 2020. The code needs to be designed, tested and deployed. Then the merchants etc need to adopt that code in their payment gateways. That takes many years. Adoption is the hardest part, what merchants accept the LN network or plan to support it?  
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:50:37
but the empty block helped me get a conf...so it is useful still. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:18:51
Is a hub like a bank?
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:43:20
Looking at the code and the implementations my guess is that LN implementations will not become mainstream until at least 2020. There is a lot of design and testing left to do before they will be usable by the average bit-coiner.

Maybe you could build that replay protection into core? It needs it considering segwit2x (NYA flag) currently has about 95% of the hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:56:23
true. Stuck much and a massive arb between gox and everything else. What a crappy time that was.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:31:33
Nahh, I am a holder since 2011. Sold all my BTC over the last 24 hours. I am now just alts and fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:24:18
The repo was moved and those 'early' stats were lost, so your data is wrong. And counting commits over actual amount committed is also a fallacy. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:37:21
yes, that probably works until the fees go up another order of magnitude. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:44:41
Dr Adam Beck in the time machine says I am telling the truth. There is no lie here. Open your eyes a little more maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:15:04
A few of the key core people have stated that a fee of $100 is acceptable. I gave up when the fees exceeded the price of a cup of coffee. Can your business still function with fees that high? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:27:30
The change takes time, up until recently the fees on bitcoin were ok. It takes time for people to swap, when they do they do not come back. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:52:27
Does it sell coffee?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:09:09
The alts are up and btc is down...People are moving to alts after the failure of 2x. A lot of people supported 2x, they are now selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:05:08
Lol, cannot win an argument so you conflate two separate statements that I have made? I did not lie. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:00:02
If this really was a big deal then the great programmers at core would have built replay protection into core to protect us from this sort of attack. That has not been done by core so this must be a non issue.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:43:27
But only (recently) has bitcoin had high fees. The swap to an alt takes time but the flows are already visible. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:49:23
low fee, that wins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:58:41
Maybe you could point out what he said was false? Cause it looks correct from how I understand it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:09:40
As a long term holder (2011) I regularly look at BTC to see if it still has a use other then as a speculative asset. This is because it's 'other uses' hold it's price up when the speculative bubbles have busted. So people should have a good hard look at if bitcoin continues to maintain it's promise on why it exists. Just holding it with the hope of profit in the future is a fools game.

The LN network has been 'a few months away' for about 4 years now...That is the very definition of vaporware. And I have personally reviewed the whitepaper and current multiple code implementations. What they have built for LN is not going to work. Do some real research and open your eyes a little.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:09:46
I would not use bitfinix. There is a good chance it will go the way of Gox. There is also a good chance that it will go the way of BTC-e. Neither is a good way to go.

It is a sad day when r/bitcoin's favourite fanboy is the dude that first forked the bitcoin code base.

How do you open a channel without paying a fee? How do you close a channel without paying a fee?

Or people have moved to Alts and are not coming back...this could be bitcoins slow death (Hearn)?
