Well this is exciting and terrifying.

Awesome! Greed felt like it had taken over the space the last year or so.  Glad to see this.

Up vote for perfect Leeroy Jenkins reference.  Well done!

I tend to agree, but when I overheard some futures traders claiming that CME market could drive down spot to 1500 I just had to understand the mechanics of how that would work.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:22:53
That is exactly what I needed to read.  Perfect.

Litecoin is a great guitar player.

What is this and how does it work?

The Bitcoin Sherpa.

The Ledger is about forty bucks and I see no reason to not use the Ledgers.  
Another cheap option is an old smartphone that no one uses.  Factory default it, then update it. Install a wallet. Then, only connect it to the wifi when you want to make transactions.  Other than that, it can sit safely in a closet or safe somewhere shut off.  The plus side to this is that you won't carry it with you everywhere and you can still use the QR / Camera to make transactions.

Yes, I'm talking about flagging for specific features for sure.  But more than that I'm talking about sharing the load for development.   Certainly we &lt;group x&gt; shouldn't just run new rules live - like BU did/does - but instead write/release their own version which flags for whatever features the organization deems important.  
This isn't really all that different than what happens now with the one exception that each organization would be signing their name publicly to "This is what we run and what we'd like to see everyone run."  
It just seems like a really bad idea for all these companies to rely on one organization to release the code which is the cornerstone of their business.  Fulltime developers at each of these companies ought to manage their own public github page which is an almost mirror of Core.  They ought not enforce new features, but they also don't have to wait for Core to make (what is often) a political decision.  
I feel as if there are some legal issues here also.....but I don't know.

Mine just went through.  Gives some insight into the inner workings of how coinbase handles transactions.  Or not....

Do you have a txid?
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:27:27
Yeah, I imagine everyone is getting their coins off exchanges today.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:23:29
I didn't realize that Bitpay did that.  But this is exactly what I'm talking about.

^This made me laugh.  I like this guy!

I have this conversation daily.  I've resorted to calling Crypto-Trading "Bingo" and I no longer try to really explain my position.  That is, unless I feel the person asking is actually interested in why I think most Alt-Coins/ICO's are doomed.

The disconnect is probably in my mistaken understanding in how development works right now.   
The goal here is to pull the political focus away from core.  I feel that the entire world is waiting on core to upgrade the block size or enforce BIP148 or in some other way decide which direction the protocol ought to go.  But I think that's probably a bad place for Bitcoin Core developers to be.  It's almost as if they manage a security/commodity/currency - and that has real legal ramifications.

I hadn't considered it sitting for that long.  But, you make a good point on that.  I was thinking for a year - ish until the guy could afford a proper Trezor (or Ledger).  Thanks for the tip.

The 21 library is open and, I believe, uses python.  There may be some techniques in there you may want to incorporate.  I will be following your progress.  Good luck, sounds like a great project.

It's a paper wallet. With the master public key QR code on the front and the private key QR code on the back.
