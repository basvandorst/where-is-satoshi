Welcome to the fascinating world of Bitcoin :)
* Make a secure backup of your Electrum Seed (write it down, put it in a safe).
* If you buy Bitcoins on an exchange, move them immediately to your wallet.
* Consider buying a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger, Digital Bitbox) if you want to store many Bitcoins securely.
* If something sounds too good to be true (especially regarding alternative cryptocurrencies and investment opportunities) it probably is. Don't invest any Bitcoins your not willing to lose.
@_date: 2016-08-14 08:06:25
oh really, then tell me a Bitcoin company that does as much for Bitcoin like they do?
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:09:07
It's like a turtles race..
@_date: 2016-08-19 12:38:16
Take it as a cheap lesson.. always google something like "shitcoinname scam" before you buy.
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:09:13
The transaction fee. I said nearly free, not free. The market will set the price.
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:07:24
The insurance company probably has so many lawyer they will never have they pay if they decide not to
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:38:00
I'd have said Lightning enabling instant nearly free micro transactions for everyone everywhere but ok, Kim has better marketing. I mean the Mega thing must be brilliant. He already made one tweet about it. Who cares about the details.

Hardforked it back to his wallet
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:07:31
seems he accidentally made a PR to the wrong code base
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:41:27
It's looking good.
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:26:06
I was just joking.
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:05:04
For most it's actually not about the hard fork or block size, it's about power. Some think they should have something to say without actually contributing
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:01:07
That's sexist.
@_date: 2016-08-21 09:51:03
In most non-US countries with a stable currency I'd say Bitcoin is accepted more often than USD.
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:24:48
This guy is a extrem bullshit talker. Liberland is great, but we don't need him.
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:11:57
Most people here are pro-progress. Most alternative implementations (e.g. libbitcoin afaik) agree with the roadmap core has too.
I don't see much innovation coming from the others.
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:49:13


How is that related to PoS vs PoW? If you don't want to trust the signatures of the developers you can build the software yourself. Problem solved.
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:39:00
Technically this would be so easily doable with Colored Coins (with paying dividends, voting, etc.) but not knowing your shareholders is a problem in most legal districtions afaik.
Which is very sad. Imagine you could invest in 100 early stage startups, just 10 Dollar each. They get 1000 investors investing 10 Dollar. 1 out of 20 startups is successfull. Win-Win situation :)
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:23:37
And? Coinbase is not responsible for you messing up things
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:13:45




Great! I hope GreenAddress, jonasschnelli ( and breadwallet ( will work together to make the best possible, plattform independent C library for Bitcoin wallets :)  with SPV, lightning, etc. integrated

I don't know what he is paying per kwatt.


They're running 24/7


Probably unlikely. There is enough space left and I don't think you can get a better deal somewhere else.
@_date: 2016-04-17 15:30:59
The village with the farm is right next to the biggest dam in Switzerland (maybe even Europe, not sure) and they made a special deal with the electricity company back then, so the power is cheap in this village. Rest of Switzerland it's not.
I think Guido (the operator) is also open for co-hosting of miners, if someone needs a secure, save and profitable place in Europe to put his miners.
@_date: 2016-04-19 09:39:25
Any good ideas?.

I think it's just bad taste if you say your competitor is dead (no matter how it is - here it's clearly not the case). Very unprofessional. As if Apple would say Samsung is dead.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:16:17


I hope it will really be more or less anonymously, even through they're working with centralized, US-based services.
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:57:30
They don't care about their own law and contradict themself (because of the orders from the top I assume).
The arrested people for illegally leaving Croatia to Serbia (going from Croatia to Liberland), then they arrested the same person for illegally entering Croatia from Serbia (when going from Serbia to Liberland).
The law exists to suppress the normal people and protect the ruling class.
@_date: 2016-04-09 08:54:20
Sure, but I always pay the same, I never get discount when not using a CC, so in practice I get something back.
@_date: 2016-04-24 10:13:09
If you followed the project closely and/or have been there you'd know he is a stupid scammer. So support Liberland, just don't support this self-appointed "president".

Smart Contracts are in Bitcoin since day 1. Touring completeness is not a requirement for something to be a Smart Contract.
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:05:10
We're still waiting for them to reveal their real business model
@_date: 2016-04-21 21:12:10


Yes, that's the case. Full node is maximum security, but for most people SPV is enough.
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:27:57
It's a first step
@_date: 2016-04-24 11:48:30
Learn about Bitcoin. Then you know about Blockchain technology.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:45:10
Regulation is probably only a problem for the other two places. But in theory the government in Korea could force the investment company to put pressure on Kraken to go into a certain direction
@_date: 2016-04-25 09:38:23
Well, it's not so easy to make money from implementing things like CT or CoinJoin. I'm sure there are several ways, but those might also be difficult to pitch to VCs
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:54:44
That's because they want a 5 star rating from you.
@_date: 2016-04-14 07:43:58
I know at least one company that is working on it

Compared to what? They lose much more money with Credit Cards (fee + chargeback).
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:14:16
Who in your opinion should decide the direction of an open source project if not those who build it?
And don't say "the community", because there is no way to say who is "the community" and who isn't. I don't want a project that is run by those who scream the loudest, and no developer would contribute to such a project.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:25:26
Which 'standard'?
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:40:23
Bitcoin companies are nearly all startups, so I guess that's unlikely. Ask banks etc. and just say Blockchain instead of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-13 10:32:07
It's funny, Kraken is based in SF, does most of it's business in Europe / in Euro and it's biggest investors in Korea. Sounds like they can be affected by bad regulations in any of those regions..

He can create new ColoredCoins / Altcoins from thin-air
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:05:16
This guy, the self-appointed president, is just talk.
We, the Liberland Settlement Association ( - an independent association not related to the "government", actually tried to settle there. However, we got put in jail by the Croatian border police. That was against their own laws, since Liberland is not Croatia.
Then we settled on the border to Liberland in Serbia, to get to know the region, won the trust of the locals and built our network for some months. We even took part in a local festival where team from the 3 Danube nations there  - Serbia, Croatia and Hungary - compete with each other, as a team from Liberland. So we're pretty successfull convincing the local people from the idea.
Now we're waiting for the curt cases we have with Croatia to settle, to force the Croatian government to make a clear statement on Liberland. Guess this will take some more months.
@_date: 2016-04-15 10:49:27
Would be a dangerous bet since miners can influence it.
@_date: 2016-04-08 10:55:08
This cards are cool, but if I don't use Bitcoin anyway (goes trough the CC payment system instead) why should I pay 0.5% fee instead of getting money back or other benefits from other CC?

More options is always good. Banks are already doing that themselves.
Not everyone wants to hold his own crypto currencies.
E.g. there are investment companies who own crypto but don't want to store it themselves.

Hi, I just applied for the Bitcoin Association Switzerland ( on your website, a non-profit run by volunteers promoting Bitcoin (we organize events with 300+ attendees, create videos from the events, talke to regulators &amp; media).

@_date: 2015-12-02 10:50:37
IMO very unprofessional to shutdown the service on such a short notice. People who build apps on top of chain now need to spend their December porting their code to an alternative instead of spending time with their family or working on the other things that were actually on their roadmap.
I'm not effected, but at least now I know I wouldn't use any service of that company for the future.

yeah, no.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:11:45
That's only possible with the help of the government. Money earned by hard work, intelligence or luck is not robbing, money earned with the help of the government is. More government (what Bernie wants) is not the solution, but more problems.

Why does it matter who brings up the question?
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:55:28
Found one\^
Do you even know how the situation looked like before Blockstream? The Core Developers working for Blockstream worked on Bitcoin Core in their spare time, only Gavin and Jeff had a salary for working on Bitcoin.
Instead of criticizing Blockstream for hiring developers to work on Core you should criticize the other startups with millions in funding for not doing so (Coinbase, 21, etc.)
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:14:27
Maybe, just maybe, people had other plans and have other things to do in December and weren't just waiting for this to come around.
The number of idiots must be really high then, looking at all the developers using the Facebook, Twitter, Google APIs.

If you activate pruning your node stops relying blocks, which would decrease the needed bandwidth a lot. If you still want to have a full-node for security just set the pruning limit to 50GB.
If that is not enough additionally set -maxconnections=XXX.
Regarding the bounty: I don't think anyone wants to work for a bounty that is not collected upfront. I wouldn't want to relay on ~20 different people to get the money when the job is done.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:59:37
hm I don't know, but you should be able to calculate that with something like this:
Size of all blocks from last month + size of all transactions from last month = maximum traffic use per connection per month (+ some minor ping pong, requests for node list etc.)
edit: you asked for bandwidth.. I don't know a good rule for that.
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:22:53
True, but the value of Fiat currencies only go down so still a good idea long term

There is no advantage using a Bitcoin bank over holding your own Bitcoins.
You still have to keep the username / password to the Bitcoin bank secure, same with a private key.
But with holding Bitcoins yourself you have fewer risks. Also there are many solutions like Hardware Wallets and Multi-Signatures which don't exist for Username / Password.

Why do you think someone, other than reddit the company, has the right to take this sub from him?

From the release notes:

I buy stuff because I need / want it, not because I think tomorrow my money is worth less. And 99.9% of the people do so because they don't understand inflation anyway.

I takes 15 years for a citizenship afaik.
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:08:02
Maybe you could turn it off for a week or so to give us a break :D
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:51:30
Well that's why some Core Devs are working on splitting out the consensus code so hopefully one day next year that code will have it's own repo, bindings &amp; packages, and very strict rules for changes. Which makes it easy for alternative implementation to use.
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:39:46
As always, blame the government.

Why split our energy if we can move forward as one to make the world a freer place?
@_date: 2015-12-16 11:46:41
Would you be willing to pay someone to implement this features? Or put some money in a bounty? Or write some code?
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:00:21
The cool thing about free market currencies is that you can use some other currency if you don't like this one. Nobody forces you to pay taxes with Bitcoin

Of course, everyone that actually works on those Private Blockchains knows that it's bullshit, but that's where the money is right now.

You can convert your Starbucks credits back into Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:11:46

This is not a BIP at all. No technical information how to do it. If you can't find a technical solution for this pay someone to do so, then it might get accepted as a BIP.


That's already the case. If I don't like a feature I wont build / activate that part of the code.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:57:43
If you activate pruning it would not relay blocks.

Those are the Bitcoin implementations / development teams I'm aware off
* libbitcoin
* btcd
* haskoin

* Bitcoin Knots
Certainly more than one, and they are all unique from code base (except the last one). Unlike the Bitcoin Cash implementations which are basically all just clones of core.

And why not? Any logical argument?
If pruning enables people to run a node that couldn't or didn't want to run one before, how can you be against it? Those people will not go and run a full node.
And anyway, if Bitcoin Core wouldn't implement it this doesn't mean others couldn't (as a Bitcoin Core fork / patched version or in libbitcoin / btcd / ..)

It's better to have a pruned node running instead of no node at all. For your security and for the network.
If disk space or traffic is a problem, a pruned node is a good option.

Makes it possible to make a transaction that is valid immediately (will be mined) but where the outputs can not be used before time X.
Unlike nLockTime which can not be mined and will not be relayed by nodes before time X.
E.g. you could make a savings Bitcoin address where you send money with CLTV so that you can't spend your own money for the next 12 months. Forced saving.
@_date: 2015-12-12 15:31:16
Right now I think you can only build CLTV transactions manually and send as raw transactions with Bitcoin Core. As always, wallets will need to implement the feature, and I assume for most wallets it doesn't have highest priority (there is so much to do for wallets already and most wallet companies / projects don't have massive manpower / funding unfortunately).

For the Bitcoin network to work it also needs a majority of the nodes to act honest. So every node that acts honest based on the policy set in Bitcoin core that relays transactions (as pruned nodes do) helps the security of the network.

I looked into it. It's not possible to do the crypto-secured trading with FIX, since you have to sign every transaction/trade with your private key (plus other things that are in the contract). The idea of FIX is to have very small and fast transactions, it does not provide a scheme for our trading (since all of our transactions are encrypted with the servers publickey).
What you can do is build an exchange where you securely store the funds with OT on an account and automatically move them to a (not OT secured) trading account when you make a order (e.g. Limit Order). There FIX would be possible for the trading part.
You maybe could add some security to this by signing an OT smart contract when you move the funds to the trading account (e.g. for a time-limited order to automatically get the money back, which forces the trading engine to sell).

Regarding Facebook, that's more a general problem. I think people who are concerned about their privacy will know that, if they link their FB account with their reddit account their identity is "public".

Nobody would trust a wallet that is not open source.
Closed source and Bitcoin is a oxymoron.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:44:33
That what's more a bad example.
What I wanted to say is that they can push Bitcoin in a direction they want to. Everytime a tiny bit, so that most users don't care and upgrade. But all together they would not accepts it. We call that salami-tactic, e.g. all politicians do it too. 
For that reasons, having just one implementation and being open source is not enough.

@_date: 2014-08-29 07:36:37
Generally a good idea, but I don't think the companies (yes, there is more than Conformal!) working on btcd need your tips. Better put them in other alternative Bitcoin implementations like libbitcoin (Darkwallet backend and more).

More competition in the ATM space will solve that.

WTF, don't tell newbies they should have IOUs instead of real Bitcoins.
Move you Bitcoin to a wallet where you hold the private keys. I'd recommend you to buy a Trezor, that makes holding Bitcoins in a secure way very easy.

OT is not a coin which you can buy, so nothing to speculate with.
Bitcoin 2.0 is for me technologies that build on top of Bitcoin or rely on it, giving it extra features.
Bitcoin is a tool for some stuff, we need more tools for other stuff (e.g. exchanges).
Nobody promoting OT will directly profit from it, but everybody who uses Bitcoin will profit from having better, nearly trust-less exchanges and other cool stuff.

If you only look at the price maybe. If you look at the technical progress we have (e.g. HW wallets), many new players on the Bitcoin market (startups and new merchants) and I'm sure also the adoption was big this year (difficult to prove). And this are the things that will make Bitcoin a long-term success.

Maybe if you do a SEPA transfer or so, but you can't send money from Europe to Japan within minutes. And also, if you make a bank-transaction at night they will hold it back until next day.
And it doesn't take 30 minutes per se. It depends on how much security the receiver wants. Maybe 1 block (10 minutes) is enough, maybe even just the transaction (if it is a small amount).

ATM one of my concerns is that the 99% of the full nodes are Bitcoin Core nodes. We need more diversity for security and that the Bitcoin Core devs can't controll the network (sure it's open source and one could fork it in worst case, but better don't even let us get there).  Setup Obelisk (libbitcoin) or btcd notes!

btcd also needs less resources than Bitcoin Core.

Wow, they even have a priest to convert people into Bitcoin believers!

Crypto contracts (legal and finance): opentransaction.org ;)
@_date: 2014-12-24 13:54:40
na sorry. There are enough Bitcoin open source projects that do something usefull with donations.
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:02:34
Real men don't use web wallets ;)
Well, exchanges are also kind of a webwallet.. you could use European exchanges.

Ubuntu is not the only Linux. Pick the UI you like. There are like 5 different choices.
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:06:52
We could do it like a lot of the other new projects in the Bitcoin space, make a lot of noise, and then release half-backed software or still have nothing ready long timer after that. That might be good if you need money at the beginning or like attention, but not very helpful in long-term.
We're interested in getting developers in, contributing to the OT code or writing applications on top of it (lots of opportunities here). Not so much on average Joe yet.
And agree, those talks were awesome. It annoys me that the BitcoinExpo guys need so much time to release time.
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:25:32
who cares.
Seriously, stop upvoting this circle marketing campaign.
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:39:11
Doesn't matter if they know it already now, every additional merchant improves the chicken-egg-situation.

Real men don't need investment advice xD
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:18:15
Step by step ;)
First we take the easier steps
@_date: 2014-07-18 08:21:16
The developers are spread all over the world. And it's a FOSS project.
Do you know where Debians home is?
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:27:01
I was very disappointed when I was in a Swiss Chalet in Canada and couldn't order Fondue, Raclett or any other Swiss food. That's a scam too :/
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:59:45
I'm in the US maybe ones every 1.5 year, so I'd like to have a number there that doesn't get deleted after not using for 1 year. And I'd like to pay with Bitcoins!

@_date: 2014-03-20 22:44:50
Because I believe in a open web, free software and open standards and try to avoid flash and other non open stuff. No open standards means no real competition possible, no competition means monopoly and no progress.
I'll try that, thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:42:41
lol, a bibel for you sir
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:21:19
At least stealth addresses should really be a standard for each wallet. Sad that many wallets are not even working on it: 
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:26:10
Yes made I mistake. Though he is talking about iTunes.
I don't see the connection to breathing or conference talks?
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:29:54
Or opentransactions.org, opentransactions.org/forum, otblog.net,  on freenode for more infos
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:24:04
Software is great, one can update it.
Nobody can update paper after it was printed.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:43:54
Nice. You should run an alternative full-node implementation like btcd or libbitcoin for the diversity of the network.
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:18:24

@_date: 2014-05-11 09:49:40
They pay one guy. Only one guy to work on Bitcoin Core. Not very impressive.
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:00:49
You are right, that's one of the many words which is used wrong over and over again.

Signing / using a key without manually checking first opens door for man-in-the-middle-attack.
If this would be easily solvable we would have solved it for PGP.

So nobody is using it for something real expect Vapetropolis?
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:46:41
Linux server are also easy to use! :)
But stick to what you like most.
Guess the people in  on freenode (libbitcoin guys) could help you.

I didn't have one sale with Mycelium so far, and I'm selling at marketprice +0.5% :(

lol, yes sue a company that was forced to do something from the government.
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:24:23
Hm Windows Server? If so, why not Linux?
Or do you run it on your desktop?
I think they (btcd and libbitcoin) should both run on Windows too, but it might be a bit more difficult.
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:47:41
Cool thx, but I doubt more than one full node on the same IP is usfull?
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:04:52
Make sure it's all open source, front- and backend.
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:28:34
Time is not a problem, we are having events every months, so if possible we'd like the new ones. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:21:41
It's easier to have such a discussion on a mailing list (which is what they are currently doing). Easier to follow and comment on every argument.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:11:31
Oh ok, I've missed that. Thanks for the link.
I like the service and it's easy to use, and since they fixed it there is no reason not to use it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:00:20
Apple sucks. That must be the reason. They want all people to move over to other systems.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:30:51
Great. Same for libbitcoin and btcd please, we need diversity in the network ;)
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:31:54
Yes, should be obvious.. I'd never trust a non FOSS app with my money.
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:09:56
If I could buy more Bitcoins with my Bitcoins I would, but I got no old-school money ;D

He's a known early adopter, having nodes running at the ETH since the ancient times ;)
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:25:50
Developing Bitcoin -
That's why we must support and use alternative implementations. Use libbitcoin (Clients: DarkWallet, AirBitz), btcd or others. And/Or setup an fullnode with those.
Like there is more than one implementation for HTTP there must be more than one for the Bitcoin Protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-15 14:23:33
Haha thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:44:04
Congratulations! :D
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:54:23
Setting up both of this alternative implementations should be very easy. If you need help join 
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:20:42
Get a job where you get paid in Bitcoins (there are a lot of those, you just must be willing to move for most). Ask your boss to pay in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-12-18 09:01:27
Strange internal communications you have..
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:26:04
That's like saying China is the leader in soft drinks because most Coca Colas are sold there.. what's important are Bitcoin startups. These numbers would be interesting (an leave exchanges out, they have 0 innovation..).
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:54:26
Please choose an alternative full node implementation like btcd or libbitcoin, that helps even more.
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:47:43
You know Circle is a Trojan horse by the US government?
@_date: 2014-12-25 14:28:32
Yes, no source code, no names, no whitepaper but already asking for donations.
I think the idea is cool and I'd maybe contribute (code or coins), but not if there is nothing.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:26:24
Manufactured in the US.
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:19:01
I hope you run an alternative implementation like libbitcoin or btcd, this would support the network. We need more diversity, even Gavin said that on his Keynote in Amsterdam.
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:52:58
Groups that already use Ƀ:
Honey Badger!
Not really relevant members.
Guess I'll just try to avoid them. Hopefully Lamassu wont print this symbol on their ATMs, would confuse newcomers.
@_date: 2014-05-13 08:15:11
Ever though about contributing something instead of just waiting? I heard it might move faster when more people help working on it...
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:11:43
I'd rather pay 100k to a developer doing something usfull for Bitcoin than paying a lobbyist.

@_date: 2014-11-20 15:07:33
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:19:50
Lol. Sure they do. It's so obvious
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:07:28
I would pay for an alternative implementation full node. E.g. libbitcoin / Obelisk or btcd nodes.
@_date: 2014-08-21 12:07:43
G+. It's more technical than FB and Twitter. More interesting content.
And meetups on meetup.com
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:53:28
They provide a open source thin-client server (Obelisk) like Electrum has. Where you sign the transaction on client side and send it to the server to send it to the blockchain. You can pick between various servers, also switch between them for different tasks and run your own. Airbitz and DarkWallet also use Obelisk.
The protocol should not be to difficult (ZMQ and packed in JSON or so afaik), and they have a Python and C++ client side library.
You want to create a wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:09:07
Spotify vs Simfy (or however the second one is called) pls

Most important Bitcoin Startup for mid- and longterm.
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:24:41
Number of commits = Importance of the developer / contribution?
Development doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:05:36
Please have a look at libbitcoin. It's very well structured, the main developer (Amir) answers fast for help and the Bitcoin-Communtiy really needs alternative implementations to decentralize the development and that we don't rely on only one implementation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:53:44
Hm the new notebook I want to buy costs 150$ more on Overstock than on Amazon, but it seems like I have to buy it on Overstock
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:37:06
Yeah, he just built and contributes to libbitcoin, sx, Obelisk, Electrum, the Bitcoin Protocol. So much fail
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:30:11
I found the Toronto one way more interesting (the talks) from a developers perspective.
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:52:56
Maybe because in every thread there is at least on guy promoting Dogecoin? Annoying
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:03:21
It would help even more if you run an alternative Bitcoin implementation like btcd or libbitcoin ;)

@_date: 2014-06-01 07:10:51
A good example why does Coinbase-Pages are dangerous.
If you want a nice URL/Key-Value for your Bitcoin Address, use Namecoin.
At least in theory coinbase could just changes someones Bitcoinaddress and link it to there own. Bitcoin is about eliminating third party trust, so why trust Coinbase with that?
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:05:29
it's not only our price that rises and drops together...
@_date: 2014-07-18 07:11:33
Well, using the FIAT money is also common sense, doesn't make it good.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:58:25
There is no reason for them to do so. If they do a 51% attack the Bitcoin price would drop so much, they would lose way to much money.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:08:49

Doge does things like this because of the marketing. Bitcoiners because they think it's the right thing to do.
@_date: 2014-08-22 07:15:08

But open source is voluntary, that is the freedom you don't have with left or right government. I can join a collective open source project or fork my own and lead it as a dictator.
@_date: 2014-08-01 08:48:58
Still true.
It's a bit Trezor specific, but it applies to every good HW wallet.
I got mine two days ago, and I feel so much saver with my Bitcoins now.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:11:50

I requested a SEPA withdraw of 16k€ on the 4. January too and received it also on the Feb 25.
I still think they are solvent (otherways why should they have done that?) and I really dislike all the speculation the people are doing before we have a official press release from MtGox.

If it is for Firefox it will probably be easy to create a standalone version with Mozilla Prism.

Don't pay taxes. Makes live easier and cheaper
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:57:22
AFAIK Bitcoind (Bitcoin Core) uses leveldb since quite some time. libbitcoin also uses leveldb, but I think the internal structure is different (the blockchain of libbitcoin is a bit bigger ATM, but Amir is working on replacing leveldb backend with some specific blockchain db he wrote, which should help a lot).
Thanks for the tip!

Electrum is not SPV, technically. It's a thin-client which needs a server.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:59:45

@_date: 2014-07-10 19:47:42

Hm I just checked again and I think you are right, it uses Berkeley DB as blockchain storage (but libbitcoin doesn't) and it uses leveldb for some caching.

You have to use a computer ONCE, to update the software. After that not anymore.

The server knows only the first of the parties, the other one contacts them encrypted (automated).
Fully decentralized CoinJoin will be implemented later, e.g. with Bitmessage.

@_date: 2014-07-07 14:27:23
I don't want to trust the closed source HW of my notebook (for sure it has a weak random number generator, built-in keyloggers etc.). This looks like a very good alternative.

What's the name of your company?
Are you not capable of running your own Obelisk server and rather trust a third party providing this service?

Nobody is in charge about the nodes (and miners) software other than the ones that actually run the nodes.
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:54:27
Because it's still difficult to store a bigger amount of Bitcoins secure and accessible.
Waiting for more hardware wallets, better multi-sig support in wallets etc. There is a lot to do before we get more ready for mainstream.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:01:00
I do it with my mobile phone since I am to lazy to enter the priv key by hand.. But that's totally insecure :/ hope someone has a better way
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:49:23
Sadly, a lot of them suck. Way to high fees and lots of personal data required. But this will change with the magical thing called competition :)
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:10:53
I like Ethereum, but it solves different problems.
If you want speed you will go with OT. If it needs to be 100% decentralized you can use Ethereum. Also, OT voting pools will support multi-signature secured Bitcoins in the OT system (e.g. for exchanges).
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:27:59
Go and make your fork of Bitcoin if you don't want to have a consensus in the network before applying big changes.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:46:07
Is it a problem to tell which one?..
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:55:44
But you then tell them that those addresses belong to you are related to you somehow.

You donated, you didn't buy Amir as a working slave.
Nowhere else you get that much code, community work etc etc etc for so less money.

I'd rather have an external open hardware device.

OT doesn't care about what kind of asset / currency you issue / use / move around, it's always irreversible and cryptographic secured. 
What the problem with Fiat is, is that you have to trust the issuer that this Fiat really exists (there is no multi-sig and public blockchain for Fiat ;)), so the best thing you can do is having some kind of security for it (e.g. Bitcoins in a multi-sig (voting-pool) smart-contract).
The one who has to deal with reversible transaction is the one who buys / redeems OT-Fiat-Tokens from the Fiat issuer. There is no cryptographical solution for that, as the old Fiat system is just broken and relies on 3rd party trust.

Right, those question should do it.
I just though for a centralized service it is more difficult to provide a way that they can't log it for sure, but of course that depends on the implementation. AFAIK the coinjoin impl. of DarkWallet gateway knows about the one party that initially starts the coinjoin (not the others that join later).
Guess the server would also have to have some random delay, otherwise it's quite easy to log who connected and which mixed txs went out on the blockchain within that time (depending on the amount of users on the server and txs on the blockchain at the time).
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:01:49
That would mean the 3000 diff is pure Wallstreet speculation and not real growth in adoption and usage.. not sure if that is healthy

It's not voluntary if you have no choice.


I have to move? What gives those people calling themself government the right to steal from me just because I live here? My ancestors have been here much longer than the current thefts and the thefts before.
I already live in a place you'd call a tax haven (grow up here). But when is slavery not slavery anymore? 100% taxation is slavery but 5% isn't? By what moral standards do you set this percentage?

Thanks for your feedback.


What is a 3rd party server for you? How much trust is the maximum for you? Remember: You always trust your hardware and your operating system anyway. With our next Airbitz release you'll have the option to use your own Electrum-Server instead of using ours, which I highly recommend for very security concerned people.


You can have thin-clients with e.g. Electrum-Servers that don't 'parasite' the network but only the servers that voluntary provide this service. Most mobile wallets use that instead of the classic SPV that relays on Bitcoin full nodes.

The "problem" with Bitcoin Remittance is that it has no big impact on the price:  One party buys them, sends them to the other country and it gets sold again immediately.

Helping people in need can be done much better on a voluntary base (=Voluntaryism) than by taxation (big government stealing money from some and give a tiny part to others - leftist dreams).

Somewhere there is a blog post from Gavin about why we should push alternative full nodes, but I can't find it ATM.
But simply said: If there is a bug in bitcoind, and 99% of the networks runs on that, we have a problem. So it would be better to have three or more implementation, all with about 30%, to spread the risk.
And it also splits the power over Bitcoin between different developers.

No options since there seems to be not enough demand. Also, that would be quite expensive. Would you be willing to pay interest for storing your fiat money? Most people aren't.

It's all of the above.
Libbitcoin Libraries:
* libbitcoin (system)
* libbitcoin-blockchain
* libbitcoin-build
* libbitcoin-client
* libbitcoin-consensus
* libbitcoin-database
* libbitcoin-explorer
* libbitcoin-network
* libbitcoin-node
* libbitcoin-protocol
* libbitcoin-server
You can use those to build your own full node or just on client side to build a Bitcoin Wallet / service. For that you probably want to look into libbitcoin-client.
Libbitcoin Applications:
* Bitcoin Explorer (bx) - Bitcoin command line tool
* Bitcoin Node (bn) - Bitcoin full node (only)
* Bitcoin Server (bs) - Blockchain query service (and full node) --- Like an Electrum Server
The servers interface is ZMQ (so no RPC or HTTPS like Bitcoin Core. It is a full bitcoind replacement (even more than that).
You can find more information here:  and on the Github Wikipage of each project.

Doesn't matter. They have nearly no nodes (with the correct data) and those who are there are mostly controlled by a few individuals (was easy to spot when the bug happened, all went down and up again at the same time).

Just changing a number in the code doesn't give you any voice in the discussion.


It would give them more weight in the discussion if they would contribute some other things instead of just demanding one change the way they want it and do nothing else for the project (in terms of code). And they can contribute it in Classic if they don't want to discuss with the core devs (which would give them credibility in the bigger eccosystem - also core if they think the contribution makes sense).


Linux and nearly all open source projects proof that's not the case.

For transactions:
* You can configure your node to note rely it (ok, need to change source code)

Censorship can only be done by government with force.

Since nobody is forcing those rules outside of their private property (outside reddit) it's NOT censorship, but house rules.

There is nothing that needs to merged into the Bitcoin network for stealth addresses. It only needs to be implemented by the wallets.
The problem with all the wallets is that most of them only support the basic features that would be possible with Bitcoin since years (just look how few of them have multi-sig implemented). The reason so far for this is, I assume, that it is very difficult to make money with a Bitcoin wallet (or that nobody found a good way to do so yet).
But if more people actively ask for it wallet would maybe focus more on it. See the stealth address tracker from :

Just because you can do something in a certain (blockchainy) way doesn't mean it makes technically or economically sense to do it.
You can be enthusiastic about a technology without building something with it. And there is enough things for developers still to be built in Bitcoin too if you want to work on your free Sunday - outside of core.

Exactly. Everybody can be part of the voting pool (if they get accepted by the rest of the pool), it doesn't have to be an exchange. It's just that they need an incentive to be part of it (e.g. for exchanges by getting trading fees), otherwise they have no reason not to collude and steal.

The companies that are part of the voting pool have their server contract and the voting pool contract on their website.

You need to send the second tx to other nodes immediately.

Maybe Bitcoin over Bitmessage, e.g. one (or several) public channel that always publish the latests blocks and one where people can send their signed tx and random nodes will pick it up?
I didn't really think this through yet, but since with Bitmessage one can receive data without others knowing about it (since everyone receives everything) this might be a easy Tor replacement?

Yes. But it just shows that 0-confs aren't secure. That's why I'm for replace-by-fee. It's a fake security people assume right now, and RBF would make certain things possible that aren't possible right now.
IMO best way for smaller things to proof it's not a double spend is something like  the coins are from a Y2-out-of-2 OR X1 output, where the owner holds one of the Y, a third-party that is known for not double spending because it would lose all reputation the second Y one and the X1 is the backup key for the owner. Similar to greenaddress.

Of course, nothing is as secure as the Blockchain itself. But it's a trade-off between security and features, cost and speed.
Also, compared to what we have now, where you trust one single entities, voting pools are much safer.

I don't know how he would use nLockTime to set spending limits. 
But, AFAIK there is no wallet with a GUI that supports nLockTime. You can use the Bitcoin Core RPC interface to manually build your tx or wallet-tool, which is part of the bitcoinj library.
Unfortunately most wallet lack many features that would actually be possible (nLockTime, Stealth Address, CoinJoin, even Multi-Sig is still no standard). Probably because making money with a wallet is difficult.

You can already double spend now. Just send the transaction with a higher fee to the miners directly and they will mine that (or you rely on their good faith that they will take the tx with a lower fee because they "saw it first").
IMO the solution for 0-conf TX is multi-signature (e.g. 2-out-of-2, or X + one of the five Y) with a service that auto-signs but doesn't auto-sign unconfirmed double spends), not first-seen.

Maybe for a super node with lots of connections. But even then, I think you'd only need a good amount of RAM to keep those connections open or so, and no ASIC (you only have to validate a block every 10 minutes and 7 tx per second, so no problem for all CPUs). But I'm just guessing.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:09:59

I'd have to check the source but I assume when a node sends a invalid block to another node (and a block over 1MB is invalid for a core node) it will probably disconnect from that node immediately.
So you might connect to XT Nodes at the first start because you got some XT IPs from the Bitcoin DNS seeder, but you will never get any other XT IPs from other core nodes, keeping the networks pretty separated.

I see the testnet as being for developers to test with a network that is close to the mainnet before releasing software on top of it.
If you change the testnet to behave different then the mainnet people can't do that anymore.
Why not try on your own testnet instead?

51% doesn't mean you find every block, it means you find 51% of the blocks. So if you mine empty blocks that would mean more tx fee for the rest of the 49%, people paying higher fees to get their tx in.

If there would be a company that wants to use a triple-signed-receipt system it would be pretty easy to write it from scratch with the basic features (transactions only, that covers like 90% of the needs).
But seems like there is no demand. Or nobody understands it. I joined Monetas to make that happen based on OT. The management fucked it up. However, if anyone starts a new triple-signed-receipt system I'd happily join and help out.

Since you say you are not a developer you should first talk to some developers with extensive Bitcoin knowledge to see if your idea should be done on a completely new blockchain or if there are better alternatives (usually there are).

If you want to start a company I'd go with the free hosted services in the beginning (just make sure you don't have too much of a vendor-lock-in).
Github / Bitbucket for git, Google App Engine or Heroku for websites and maybe additionally a free hosted DB (depends on the DB you need).

You could also run a libbitcoin-node or btcd node instead. Then you'd support decentralized development even more since unfortunately they aren't run by many people atm.

I doubt the new people joining know or care about SegWit.
Reasons the LiteCoin price went up is because Bitcoiners both LiteCoin. Pumping an alt is easier - usually it's money from Bitcoin moving there. Bitcoin price going up like currently means new money coming in. New money doesn't care about Segwit, they join because Bitcoin is already useful for them how it is now.
Ofc SegWit would still help a lot long term by making Bitcoin more usable, but I think it's influence on the price will only be really effective ones it's activated.

Trezor will become cheaper with time / more competition (e.g. Ledger).
Ofcourse most of the population can't check the source code. Neither can they check the actual Bitcoin Core source code. But at least you can pay somebody who is independent to check the source code for you, which is not possible with closed source HW. And if it is open source you can be sure there are some hackers or university researchers that take a look at it if it handles money.

Optionally you could use another Bitcore server if you want to keep using Copay / Bitpay wallet (but afaik nobody is running one atm) that supports Segwit / UASF.
I was considering running a public Bitcore Server but usually there is no interest because the setting is very hidden and most people don't care (beside that it's also quite some cost).

Depending on the country it's expensive to have many small investors compared to a few big ones. E.g. in Switzerland you'd have to go to the government for every shareholder to register which costs you money and time every time.

I don't think this is almost nothing. What are your contributions to Bitcoin Core?
Also this (and the Github profile) doesn't show comments / review on Pull Requests, Issues, Mailing List and IRC discussion, etc.
Why do you think someone that contributes to Bitcoin Core has to do it 100% of his time, or a certain amount of commits per month? I'm sure if you go and pay Peter for working on Bitcoin Core we will do even more work. And do you think Bitcoin developers don't have to eat?
What's your purpose with this topic?

Great work!
It is a problem, but also, when you use other non-SPV thin-clients that have a client-server architecture the server knows all your addresses (blockchain.info, GreenAddress, Electrum, DarkWallet / Obelisk, Airbitz, etc.).
For both kind of architectures (SPV and client-server) there are solutions to this problem, but I think right now nobody implemented any.
Using SPV clients is still a good idea, it makes you independent of any server.

PoW is the only consensus mechanism that has proven that it works. And nothing else looks like it does. Even if it does it can still be done as a sidechain (without merged mining ofc).

I disagree. Bitcoin is a way to free people from the oppression of central banks.
For now not everyone has the technical knowledge to store their Bitcoins in a save way (wallet UX/UI, HWs etc. still have a long way to go). I rather have those people buying Bitcoin certificates (which is no different than storing Bitcoin on Coinbase - just that the counter party risk is much lower because it's a real, old and big private bank) than keeping their money in fiat.

Core Devs should maybe make the minimum-relay fee for OP_RETURN TX much higher (e.g. 5-10 times as high) as for other same size txs.
For timestamping using a standard like opentimestamps this still wouldn't be a problem, but might stop people from doing stupid things.

Thanks. Since you are already running a Bitcore node with UASF you should consider installing the bitcore-wallet-service to serve Copay wallets

Yes. Or a voluntary group of people owns it.
How do we protect the environment right now? We don't. It's a big failure. Corruption of government makes it possible to destroy nature if there is profit for the man in power through guns (aka politicians, or those who actually control them).
In a stateless society, if I want to keep the nature clean in my neighborhood I'll start an association and buy it. Noone can just come and claim it's theirs and that the "public needs" justifies that we have to build a coal power station there.

If you own Bitcoins you have an incentive to have a good, decentralized network. But you don't get a direct revenue from running a full node.
It helps significantly. Having the majority of the full nodes controlled by one entity would also be bad, it's just less likely to happen to with mining pools.

Yes, it's a JPG. You can see it when you use the Entropy with your computer.

How to get your full node(s) one Microsoft Azure for free:
1. Setup a website that looks like a startup / start a startup
2. Register as startup at 
3. Get up to 5 times 120 USD free credit per month for 3 years (can't combined the 120k, it's per account)
Maybe it depends on the country if this works for you or not. I've registered with BizSpark and all they did was checking my website (back then I didn't have a commercial register entry because you don't need one in Switzerland as long as your company does less than 100k per year).

You can see on the blockchain that nobody else bought this particular leak (since there were no transactions made to that Bitcoin address before).
Of course there is no way to make sure he didn't sell it also to somebody else off-market (selling the same thing on Darkleaks twice would be more difficult, since you can at least verify a part of it with the part you can encrypt from the beginning).

What part of their API are you actually using? 
Bitcoin Core has a built-in REST API: 
Which can be extended if there is a need (and someone willing to do it). So every node can be a API like Blockchain.info etc has. If one node is down, just use another one (in theory, right now I think most people don't have the port for the REST open, but if they know about it we could maybe change that).
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:56:03
Starting with the next release (0.10, headers first change) it will sync much much faster (about 3h).

That's the keyword. Otherwise you have a vendor-lockin. Remember when Chain turned off their API with 1 month notice?

Any plans to open source the server software too?
Would be great to have some kind of standard API for Bitcoin Blockchain Querying, maybe some REST API with websockets for subscriptions.

How to get free Bitcoins in Step 1: Create topic about how you just discovered Bitcoin and you think it's fascinating!
Step 2: Create topic saying you just bought your first Bitcoins!
Step 3: Create topic saying you set-up / run a full node!
Step 4: Spend your free coins on hookers and cocaine
I don't say this applies in your case, but topics like this are super useless.

That's surprising. AFAIK you need a license for pretty much everything in Nevada otherwise

You should run Bitcoin Knots with uasf flag. It connects to UASF nodes first

Please tl;dr:
I'm not visiting the front page of the internet to have to read the full internet

Hi can you set your bot to start this topic when the Monday starts in the first country (UTC+14)?
It's was already 11:30 in central Europe and much earlier in Asia.

I'm wondering why the small pools like ConnectBTC, Kano CKPool don't signal for anything (
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:52:20
Why does it not enable BIP148 by default?
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:10:28
But will the SEC go after the ICOs where the company is not based in the US? If so, how?
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:42:12
Only if you include the scams.

Not sure, I doubt he actually wants BU, he just doesn't want any change to keep collecting high fees.

Would be cool to have something like OIN ( but for Bitcoin, where all Blockchain / Bitcoin companies contribute their patents to.
Also, please get in touch with UBS / Alex Batlin ( Thanks!

The PBOC is watching :O

Roger Ver?

Isn't 0.08 way to high for Chinese miners? The website probably lists consumer prices.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:00:37
Great :)
Thanks for your efforts.

See the last section of their press release (it's in German, but Google should be able to translate that into English if needed): 
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:13:02
They already prove that it works. It's up to the wallets and exchanges to integrate it
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:39:51
I heard atm all hardware wallets are sold out for months..
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:32:18
ah yes, sorry. It's per account in your Bizspark program 120 USD free credit. So 5 times 120, but per account, can combine them in one account.


It worked for me.. I don't work for MS..
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:00:24
They did a ICO before it was "cool"
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:20:28
It's good news that something is happening. It needs more then agreeing to the postulate, they also have to make laws (if needed, but I don't think so, clarification and a clear statement from the government is probably enough) and vote for this.
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:16:14
There are many exchanges in the US, they just don't have any volume. Yet another exchange wouldn't fix that.

This is cool, but I don't consider Bitcoin as ready for the mainstream adoption. What desktop client should your grandma use? All of them are in active development (still 0.x version). There is still no hardware wallet (Bitcoin Trezor etc.) available to use Bitcoins from an malware infected PC (which are &gt;50% of all PCs). Only the mobile apps are ready IMO.
I would have waited with this project another half year.
