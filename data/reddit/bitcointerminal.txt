Multi-signature scripts set a condition where N public keys are recorded in the script and at least M of those must provide signatures to release the encumbrance. This is also known as an M-of-N scheme, where N is the total number of keys and M is the threshold of signatures required for validation. For example, a 2-of-3 multi-signature is one where three public keys are listed as potential signers and at least two of those must be used to create signatures for a valid transaction to spend the funds. At this time, standard multi-signature scripts are limited to at most 15 listed public keys, meaning you can do anything from a 1-of-1 to a 15-of-15 multi-signature or any combination within that range.
Multi-sig is also very useful as a "zero-trust escrow" for example: let's say you are the seller of an item and you go to bitescrow.org you then setup a 2 of 2 transaction where you insert your multi-sig key and then you give the buyer the transaction invite code which allows the buyer to add his key and an address to send the payment to. the payment is then held in this escrow account until the buyer receives the item. Assuming the buyer is happy with the transaction then both the buyer and seller will both sign the transaction with their keys which releases the coins from the escrow 2 of 2 multi-sig address to the sellers Bitcoin address. Technically the buyer could screw over the seller by not signing the transaction after receiving them item but this wouldn't be beneficial to the buyer as he/she would not be able to take back the funds in the escrow address as it would require BOTH buyer and sellers multi-dig keys.
