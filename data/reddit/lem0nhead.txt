Maybe you don't need to store the full blockchain, but you would at least need to download it all (and downloading ~20 TBs isn't trivial). But I agree it might be acceptable since it only needs to be done once.

Hm, TBH I don't see routing as a big issue. I wasn't aware of this need, but we solved routing on a bigger scale already (the Internet).

My point is that with current technology adding 5 TBs/year to the blockchain is not feasible (at least if we care for decentralization).
Besides, commodity HDDs aren't increasing too much anymore; now that pretty much everything is "on the cloud", people's storage needs are not increasing as they were, so I don't see why notebooks would start comming with 100 TBs HDDs 5 years from now for instance.

Removing APIs won't stop automatic trading, it would just take a few more hours of development.

Yes, but that's a risk. If it costs $5 to create a block, it costs $30 to create a 6-blocks reorg.

I don't see how this address the problem. I mentioned before to support 1 billion people opening/closing channels each 3 months we'd need about 100 MBs blocks.
You're saying we could use Litecoin or other coins. That's fine, but their combined storage would still be around 5 TBs/year.

This doesn't address my point, but it's a fair view. Have an upvote.

What makes bitcoin special though? My understanding is that LN can (and will) be enabled on multiple coins (LTC?)
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:40:48
The topics you mentioned basically only explains how LN works.

If you're talking about miners, then yes, they will get centralized (I mean, they already are).
But if we talk about full nodes, AFAIK they don't need to keep UTXO and it's ok if they take 1 minute to validate a block. So storage is the biggest problem for them.
EDIT: and I don't see how pointing out OTHER problems makes your argument stronger.

I'm actually happy with the discussion so far.
In any case, do you recommend some other place to discuss this?

Let's consider I overestimated the number by a factor of 2 then; the problem still exists.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:32:24
Then wouldn't we have a bigger problem (low miner's incentive)?
