I only see, that they use this for verification. What am I missing?

Germany, but I would've heard about this. Would be that awsome :)

Is there someone that saved his wallet.dat? Current price makes it rentable to brute :)
If I'm able to crack, I'll send the uploader 50%.

This was the point wich kept me from buying. And I thought I was the only one thinking this way.

I'll have a look at Kraken. I'm using SEPA right now, but it's to slow for me. The bitcoin.de Bank would be an option to think about, but the avarage exchange rate is overpriced in my opinion.

I also would buy a house. But a month afterwards I could have bought two. A year later maybe 10. 
My problem is: If the price is high enought to buy a house, I might evantually be tempted to buy one. But afterwards I don't own any BTC anymore. So I better prevent myself a few years from accessing and by that time the price could be high enought to buy a house AND still own some BTC :)
Haha, no I don't believe in fiat. I have 90% BTC and also use a BTC credit card for spendings like you do.

As I understood it from  "Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain.", it's about when the tx will be minable and not about when it's broadcastable.

As I stated that wouldn't be a problem for my case, as I could save the signed tx and broadcast it after the locktime has passed.

Awesome, thank you! CLTV would solve the hard fork problem and still lock my funds as I wish.
Would it be, that if a hard fork occurs the funds on Shitcoin XY would also be locked, right?

I already do it physically (even if it's not time based) using a cryptosteel + lock + keys thrown away. Like this I need a side cutter to get to my coins. 
But, let's say a BTC is worth 100.000 $. In this case my temptation could be to high and I might break the lock (or the time lock safe) to dump those coins, missing out the 1 Mio $ + pump afterwards :D

Would also like that. Switching is not possible as Mycelium is the only Trezor wallet for Android.
EDIT: I'm wrong! GreenAdress also supports Trezor on Android! Awesome
EDIT2: Well ok, but you can't set custom fee on GeenBit
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:46:58
Should be true. I also thought about this and that wouldn't be a problem for my case.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:13:08
I actually wanted to delete the private key after tx signing to be unable to spend before the time has passed. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:41:53
To prevent me from dumping essentially
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:59:36
I did'nt think about those. Good point, thank you!
Shitty future hard fork ICO's preventing my hodl strategy, as I'd like to dump those.

I'm also getting no reply (mail, support center, twitter, facebook, ..). I've paid using Sofortüberweisung (direct payment).
