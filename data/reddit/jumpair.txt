Both you and the OP could be right ;-)

TL;DR - be prepared for anything, in which case HODL

B-b-b-but Mooooom!

To be fair, he believed in it since early days.

It sounded like Max Keiser of Keiser Report - check it out on YT
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:21:22
Mr Keiser, long time!

Not your keys, not your coins. Hopefully people get educated before jumping into this derivative bullshit.

Could expand on this please? What would this look like in pratice and why? Thanks

We don't know
Saved you reading 100s of out-of-ass TAs
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:09:08
Thanks for the answer.
Would that theoretically be a change resulting in only, e.g. gpu or cpu mining algorhithm working? If so, why is that not done? 
My guess is there are other more pressing matters, but to make a change like Monero did would be interesting to watch unfold.

They should ask that famous hacker Mr 4chan.

Ah, the elusive Bitcoin Cyclops.

Thank you, shall we all buy bcash instead? ;-)

What do you mean it's gone?!?!

Even better, read about hardware wallets or cold storage and move your coins there. If you want to invest higher amounts, it's worth the cost of a wallet.

Transfer £ to Coinbase (Faster Payments), deposit £ from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro, the same parent company so no fees, buy btc on Cpro as limit buy, no fee.

Just watched Dirty Money on Netflix about a certain bank laundering drug cartel's hundreds of millions for years. Bringing this up regarding crypto makes me laugh.

My understanding is that the fees miners get from confirming transactions could be compared to banks receiving fees for offering banking services to customers.
A bank getting bailout for screwing everyone over for (near)criminal behaviour and millions losing their homes/savings etc. only because they are cosy with governments or are "too big to fail" is difficult for me to put on par with miners.
