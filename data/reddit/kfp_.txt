I don't agree it is that valuable. Bitcoin is the valuable application of about 10 billion USD.
It is just the technology supporting crypto currencies.
So far i gave seem more hyped blogs and twitter quotes than true applications outside crypto currencies.
I feel the hyped shouters have no understanding of concepts of trust, mining incentives, techniques, to validate what other bloggers shout.
Banks trust central banks, and house owners have more trust on a notary than a technology they don't understand.

If that's all, all the fuzz in this treat is more likely scare people, than a well informed warning with the right timing.

"Do you have a smartphone with you? Great, ill show you." Take your phone and give them some.
Best way to get people started, and from there I bet you they start asking questions.

What is the difference between value and intrinsic value?

Bitcoin is not used by general population. I don't think segwit will make any difference to that.

Molding security product to be multi-purpose is not a good idea.
Each time you want to look at your password, you look at your bitcoins.
Keep the money in the safe, and the food in the fridge.

Impossible, with a 1mb block limit it would take ages for everybody to do a transaction.
If would be a slow slow slow walk, not a run.

Bitcoiners are not smarter. And be careful, a lot here think bitcoin is the jesus that will safe this world from evil central bank money. that way of thinking makes it difficult see the current system with clean eyes. We do have healthcare, education, and technology progression.

I don't know why explanation of this system almost always has a cloak of 'hidden' and 'conspiracy' on it.
It is not conspiracy, or hidden, nor secret.
This is just our money system, with its pro's and con's.
Just explain it, with its risks and benefits.

I understand (almost) everybody here disagrees, but the scary outcome is indeed that non-government regulated cryptocurrencies might be abandoned somewhere in the world. It is not that unlikely to happen.
She doesn't strike me as a dumb person, i guess she really believes or at least like the ideas she is posing. 
Take this to learn from, not just to ridiculize.

Might become true, in a sad way.... The dollar might crash

Besides funny to laugh at, it shows bitcoins and related concepts are to difficult to understand for the masses.
The script writer thought it was best to use that wrong phrase, maybe because he didn't understand the concept himself, or because he know 99% of his viewers won't understand the correct version.
The movie dope was accurate, so there is hope!
