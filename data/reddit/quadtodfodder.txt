&lt;noob&gt; doesn't all the mining put downward pressure on the price?  Surely the amount of mining going on now is greater than ever before (a miner rig that isn't on is losing money, right?)  Mass awareness/interest is at an ebb at the moment, so doesn't that plus all the new coins explain at least a bit of this?&lt;/noob&gt;

I know reddit is not a monolith, but I feel like in a recent "I lost my coins" thread, Trezor was bandied about as the "this is what you *should* have done" option.

I hold that if you draw a line through the non-bubular bitcoin price over time, you it goes straight through $30-$40 today.  I AM NOT AN ECONOMIST.  But I am waiting for $40.

Th price of a cup of coffee would only have doubled over those seven months, paid in bitcoin!
However, if you had bought coffee on the dip, you could have made a killing.

Coinbase is a "real company" that runs "real code" using brand new technologies such as version control.  I'm not saying it's infallible, but they have the basics of professionalism down at least.
Gox did development on live code which was stored in a database(?!?), and had exactly one developer.  "special kind of fuckup" are truely the most choice words to describe the situation over there.

Ok, I see the quote.  Now tell me where satoshi indicates s/he is ancap or built BC explicitly for/due to anCap.

I sound like a Canadian, but I'm not.  I don't see why we're getting all up in arms about this.  All I said is that (IMO) there in nothing explicitly ancap about BC and that ancap is fringier than BC.  I am sorry if this enrages people, I thought we were doing discussions here, not trolling r/econo-atheism

I'm not sure who yo're quoting or calling a dick - I'm just stating my thoughts on the subject.  No need to get upset or call names.

Because AnCap is more than those two words combined.  
Ancap is a fairly specific way of running society.  Bitcoin can work well under vanilla democratic capitalism, scando-socialism, somali-chaos - whatever.  
Also Ancap is pretty fringy and Bitcoin (IMO) has a lot more potential to be a mainstream force in society.  Tying it to AnCap ultimately hinders BCs acceptance into the mainstream.
To put it another way: it is a lot more likely that BC becomes a force in democratic capitalism, than that it ushers in a state of anarcho-capitalism.
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:00:51
Yes I am aware that doesn't like ancaps.  Because BICKERING IDIOTS!  Plug the fucking hole!

I mean it is technically true - if you evade a legal issue long enough, to the point of running away from cops in the end, chances are you'll get shot at.  
That said, donutmuncher seems to have bigger issues with society than bitcoin exchanges and how they interact.
*edit - after thinking about it for a second, perhaps donutmunchers concern with bitcoin is directly related to his larger issues with (and hopes for) society.

My "model" said it should drop to $40 when it was at $70, so I waited.  Then I was waiting for a dip after silkroad at $200 to get in.  Now it's at $500 *after* a crash. 
I don't know if I have the stomach for this much success.
@_date: 2013-07-22 22:51:54
Oh my fucking christ.  This isn't supposed to be a holy war, I was just weighing in with my opinion about ancap in the sidebar.  Perhaps a simple downvote would suffice, or maybe a few words about why you disagree, instead of a two day flame war.
It isn't my thesis for crissake.  Go take a cold shower.

But if you compare this chart to the total transactions, you see that this means *most* of the day to day volume is gambling, which seems un-good to me.  
And further - that the gamblers stopped playing for the moment.
