People are pissed off they have been stolen from yeah and a lot have been demanding authorities be involved/audits/whatever else. They also realize the situation is complex and there is a chance of losing everything. If I lost access to 100% of my belongings and I can get back 64% immediately instead of 0% for years with a possibility of even less than 60% that's a good thing. Am I happy about the overall situation? No, but it sure has hell beats losing everything. Also accepting 64% of your stuff back doesn't mean all investigations have to stop, they are not mutually exclusive. In my example I would sure as hell keep investigating the burglar after getting 64% of m stuff back. People are unhappy they got stolen from, but they realize getting 64% back is the lesser of the two evils at this point. Investigations can still happen after getting majority of your money back.

Reading that guys responses in this thread he is pretty delusional.

I love that you "grammar nazis" act like you hate doing it, but you obviously love nit picking peoples reddit posts. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:12:46
You're such a delusional twat its hilarious. Maybe you can sick your "legal team" on all of us redditers as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:29:19
Who exactly is saying "THANK YOU !"?
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:47:48
Isn't it because they will buy them back at $1? Like you can trade it to someone else for a discounted price but then BFX will buy it back from that person for $1?

stupid question with the phone wallets, like Bread, if the phone were to break say get dropped in the ocean for example. You would just need to use your secret phrase to open that wallet on a new phone right? The Bread wallet confuses me a little, its not stored somewhere  else like coinbase is right?

You keep up pretty well? What that supposed to mean? you are talking like you have been in this situation a bunch of times. How many times have you dealt with an exchange being hacked and closed and then waiting for it to re-open? Coming back online is a big deal for a lot of people and you don't see why they would be pissed if the 2 hour notice happens while they are asleep? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:14:28
Definitely a lot less in Utah due to population size differences, but we do have a lot of tech companies in this area, "silicon slopes", and a lot of more tech friendly people that goes along with that.

Man there are some loonies on this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:05:56
This was such a horrible move for their company. Lets take this 20 year old who seemingly doesn't even have full details on what happened/is happening, stick him in a teamspeak interview which turned more like an argument that he wasn't even close to winning. The whole teamspeak announcer thing made it seem even more amateurish as well. Everything just came across as really unprofessional and he didn't seem to know wtf was going on. That's really not how you want to portray your company when trying to repair you image. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:24:33
Yeah I feel for you guys on that. I didn't have any money in Bitfinex but I know if I did I would want to be one of the first ones getting it out, as its probably going to be a crazy time. So them giving a 2 hour notice is pretty bull shit. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:26:30
Right? Even if the whole company is going down in magnificent flames, you usually see the CEO step up and try to calm everyone down.

will do, is there an app for it on IOS?
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:21:54
None of those things = "thank you". I honestly don't know what to tell you if you haven't seen that shit either, maybe you aren't looking? Because I and everyone else have seen it. Also it would be "64% is better than nothing" which it literally is, 64% is better than 0% which was a very real probability of this situation. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:17:41
Thats what I'm curious about. Shouldn't they be locked in to having to pay $1 for each token? Like other users can buy the token from someone looking to get rid of them for less, but then BFX would have to buy it from the other user at $1 per token.
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:37:02
yea I agree, but didn't catch it when I wrote it. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:28:09
This gets asked to the people who had a lot of money on the exchange, in 90% of the threads here. Pretty much every time the answer is going to be they used it for trading.

There was that guy on here the other day who was talking about using his "legal team" against them. The jackass had 12k total on the exchange and didn't seem to understand why no one was taking him seriously, it was a great thread.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:07:12
ITT OP getting butthurt because people are telling him what an awful idea it is. Also, OP telling people to go away after posting on a public forum. This is golden, delusional OP responding to everyone a well, can't wait for my turn.
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:46:22
No its not, its being real. 64% IS better than 0%. You can acknowledge that and still not be happy about it.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:29:10
no one "has" to talk so IDK what your crying about. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:32:00
According to users in this sub lately it seem that everyone who doesn't agree with them is "shilling"
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:39:07
Generally that statement refers to making bad trades/investments or market tanking, I still agree somewhat, but it's a bit more of a bitch if your money gets stolen due to negligence of a company.

Not to mention, taking Apple to court would be fucking expensive. I don't even want to know how many lawyers/ how much resource they have.

Why would he do this interview, when he seemingly has no actual details on the information? The amount of "i'm not sure" "I don't know" etc was pretty bad. Also, why the fuck is the teamspeak voice going throughout the whole interview. IDK the whole thing just came across as a mess, not a good look while your trying to repair your image. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:48:16

Yeah I've actually been using it for a little while and quite enjoying it. Although I kind of defeated the purpose of it a little bit by withdrawing the money from it recently and put it in to bitcoin. I'm still keeping the app though as it helps me set aside money that I would otherwise end up blowing through.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:37:13
Yeah maybe I misread but I was under the impression coinbases new fees were going to be more expensive than other options. I will check out local bitcoins, although I think I may dislike the aspect of having to meet with people when I want to buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:20:50
lol I always find these comments funny, talking about Reddit as if everyone making comments in other threads are the same people with dissenting opinions in this thread. Reddit is filled with different people ofcourse there is going to be contradicting opinions...
@_date: 2016-10-19 04:39:14
This guy has had his videos debunked every time. I'm not a video editor but probably something like asking a question to get a certain answer then editing that answer as something to another question. Also just taking things out of context playing one part of a statement and then cutting it. Reality TV shows do this sort of thing all the time. Look there is some bad stuff in there but its hard to know the extent of what is in context and what is out of context or edited when its coming from a guy who has been proven by a court of law to fake videos in a similar fashion. This standard being applied to him isn't because he is on the "right" its because he has already ruined his reputation. He should be able to release the tapes and prove everyone wrong if he wants to be believed. Its like a case of the boy who cried wolf.
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:06:46
Just as a heads up to everyone. The guy that created that video also created some other videos which were found to be heavily edited and set up to be misleading. IIRC he actually had to pay $100,000 after being taken to court.  I am at least taking that video with a grain of salt unless he decides to release the unedited tapes. The last time he made a video and the unedited versions finally came out it was a far different story.

Yep Trump supporters seem to be spamming that video in every sub I visit today so I try to shed a little light on it. It could be completely legit, but with that guys track record I'm not gonna take it at face value, I will reconsider if the full interviews are released. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:41:15
Just looking at different best selling lists for places like B&amp;N and Amazon and it doesn't support what you stated. Although I'm sure you will move the goal post again like you did after the guy corrected you on no one reading books.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:04:25
Right? They have consultants on the show so they can at least keep the hacks in the realm of possibility even if they depict it in a much simpler way for the viewer. This guy is just one of those people that thinks complaining makes him so much smarter than all the plebs.

He's saying your initial proposed chain of events wouldn't kill it. Then you responded "follow the chain longer" but he problem with that is its your made up chain so he can't really follow it.

Well from my like 0 experience, I believe it only refers to "expert witnesses"  . Like for example we need a medical expert to analyze the injuries compared what is claimed to of happened. "In my expert opinion, that bruise would take a fist size 5 inches or larger" or some shit like that. I agree though that can still be shady as hell. Again However, I have 0 experience, but this is reddit so my comment will just piss some lawyer off and they will comment with a more accurate answer.

Yep you can use a program/proxy to control the communication between their server and your machine where you switch out the session ID assigned to you with the session ID of the user your trying to hack. I learned out to do it on less secure web pages so not sure if it would be done a different way on that website.

There's no real best way to learn coding as everyone is different. However, as many people will probably tell you. You will learn the most from doing your own projects. You could try codecademy or sites like that to get the basics, then start doing your own projects and use the internet to solve problems you get stuck on.

Wow man, the guy was asking on opinions for the best way to do something and you took that as a chance to try and tell him how stupid he is. Then you got butthurt when he corrected you? just gtfo.
