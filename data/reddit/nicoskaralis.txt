tl;dr: you can get import your seed words on electrum but you can't take the seed words from electrum anywhere else
Electrum does not use bip39
The words electrum gives you are a modified version of bip39 that are specific to electrum, they have a different checksum and a way to check word list version
My advice: open electrum, send all btc to a different Wallet and import that Wallet on electrum

Because I'm having problem understanding what the code does 
I just want a step by step explanation so I can follow along and understand what is going on

My advice, please take it with a grain of salt, also very technical
Get your recovery seed and go [here (bip39 decoder)]( get all your keys and create a tx manually
I was getting a fee close to $50 to send $20 (I believe the same reason as you).
Managed to confirm a tx with fees close to $0.03

Although that video is good for a beginner to start understand Bitcoin addresses I want to generate an address manually (using programing scripts but without a public library)
I want to understand which technics are used, which methods are called, parameters, etc

Not trying to be political here, but given the current state of politics on US, I have to say: I can imagine
