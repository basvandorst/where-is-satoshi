As someone that could drop dead on short notice, a family to support, and a computer illiterate wife, I choose Coinbase 10 times out of 10.

Just checked xe.com....  Dollar is stable/gaining against other currencies.  In this case it's Bitcoin.

People in it for a quick buck are a great service to the system.  The reason you can jump it at any time 365/24/7 and buy or sell with a small spread is because there are lots of people doing short term trades.  If these people didn't exist, then the value of the overall system goes down.

Yes, but it depends on the wallet.  For example, those with BTC in Coinbase didn't get access to Bitcoin Gold, but will get access to the 2x coin.  I think there are some threads around here dealing with wallet compatibility.

I'm guessing the 2x coin will be worth about $500, and that Bitcoin will drop about $500.  But you'll own both.
Just my guess.

It went down about 20% a couple weeks before when the prefork chatter hit a peak.  (it recovered within days)  It dropped $200+ pretty quickly after the cut off time.  It did go up in the days that followed.

Passing on Bitcoin access instructions to someone can't/won't understand it, in a way that doesn't open up even bigger security holes, is a bigger risk to me than bank risk.
Coinbase isn't Mt.gox.  Their vault minimizes the risk of a hacker stealing all of my funds in the "traditional" way.  They're insured against mass breaches.  And when I die, my family can access BTC through a death certificate, etc....  I also noticed their customer service increases significantly as you hold more with them. (for better or for worse)

It dropped a few hundred in the days leading up to Bitcoin Cash....  which was about the same value that BCC was trading at when it launched.  I don't know for sure that's exactly what it was, but it made sense to :D
