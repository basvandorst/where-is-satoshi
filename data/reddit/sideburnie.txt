Yep! Check out a live demo of our control panel at  (click the "try a live demo" link).

Yeah, I agree that's definitely possible. We can all hope. Seems they continue to mine, either way (which would seem to imply that they have something more recent than their original 55nm build?):  (they're "pool 34")

We'd be happy to help! Our HashCenters are mostly hyrdo-powered so they have almost no carbon footprint--making them very environmentally friendly. They're also 5-10x the efficiency of a traditional datacenter with a peak PUE (power usage effectiveness) around 1.03. You should feel confident that HashPlex has the environment in mind when we build our HashCenters.

If you have a window there's no need for a contractor. :)   $110 per killowatt of heat output. Nearest competitor (Antminer S5) is ~4x that.

right, that's one of the things I was trying to point out--that they can't actually build something for mining that will be profitable that runs out of the home--it's not possible to build an ASIC that is that much better than the competition... especially if you have no means of IP protection. I really look forward to their contributions otherwise (they do have a dream-team, so to speak). I just don't want to see them further tarnish the face of mining by yet again leaving retail consumers "with the bag."

Thanks! Yeah, as a person who also had an apartment full of SC Singles, I can empathize.

Because a user of the phone will pay for it directly or indirectly, and 21 will benefit from 75% of the mining power. That user could have spent that money on mining power that actually generates a profit by sending it somewhere it will flourish:

according to the FT article, 21 has planned to take 75% of mining revenues ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯:

I worry that neither of these can be the case. The design for a SHA256 ASIC is too simple, and if you ship it publicly (which Bitfury has stopped doing), too easy to quickly reverse engineer. I worry that they will have at most a 25% (temporary) advantage over their nearest competition through capital thrown at 14nm NRE.

Rates: We charge $99/kw-month. If you reach a threshold of at least 30 kw, we discount to $89/kw-month.
Profitable: At 8PH difficulty and $800 exchange rate, an Avalon makes 10x our price per month, and a KNC Jupiter makes 100x our price per month.
The Customer: Our customers can now rest in confidence that they have the best long-term hosting solution: they never have to worry about security, internet downtime, heat, space, or doing maintenance or equipment reboots ever again.

No I hadn't seen that! Thanks for sharing. Super high efficiency &amp; low emissions systems like fuel cells are really cool and actually pretty cheap incrementally when they run on natural gas (like Bloom's), but they have high up-front cost. I think few solutions beat the cost and environmental friendliness of hydro-electric power.

We have experience ranging from hardware engineering for Apple and Microsoft Surface to datacenter design for Facebook to enterprise web software for Google and Facebook. I think most will consider automated reboots to be within reasonable purview. We currently run BFL and KNC hardware and will be running all others as they ship to us (cointerra, hashfast, bitmine, etc.).
