my proposal would be to mine the transactions too and divide the block reward among the guys mining the transactions and the block. the update would be coordinated trough the extra nonce. this is a free space for the miner to put a message in. if x nr of blocks in sequence have the magic number in the extra nonce the switch is made. further more to prevent a blocksize issue, introduce a consensus block. this block holds all current balances. the block is introduced every x nr of blocks. in this way not all blocks need to be downloaded to calculate the balance at your adress. for safety the miners should download the blockchain further into the past, like 1 year or so.

1 Spending isnt always good in the longterm. It should be done when needed. This means more and more people will make or do things that are actually needed. Also lets call it saving instead of hoarding.
2 True bitcoin is volitile but thats because its still young. People with a lot of money can cause up and downswings now. As the marketcap grows the group up people that are able to cause this shrinks.

@_date: 2014-01-04 00:53:57
It can be done but has issues. Say there is a trustworthy entity such as a bank or government who owns the private key but gives out the note with the public key. The note can be verified by checking the blockchain. In return for a note the entity gives you the bitcoin. Now you just got to deal with a centralized organisation and counterfeiting, just like 'real' money

I would say the bitcoin average is your go-to exchange. Also you need to export all your adresses ever used, at least for the first year. And keep track of the coins you have used for reporting already. This can al be automated in an exchange. This can be a USP for an exchange.

FAQ says: What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred instantly and securely between any two people in the world. It's like electronic cash that you can use to pay friends or merchants.
What are bitcoins?
Bitcoins are the unit of currency of the Bitcoin system. A commonly used shorthand for this is “BTC” to refer to a price or amount (e.g. “100 BTC”). There are such things as physical bitcoins, but ultimately, a bitcoin is just a number associated with a Bitcoin Address. A physical bitcoin is simply an object, such as a coin, with the number carefully embedded inside. See also an easy intro to Bitcoin.
How can I get bitcoins?
There are a variety of ways to acquire bitcoins:
    Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.
    The most common way to buy bitcoins are the Bitcoin Exchanges
    There are several services where you can trade them for traditional currency.
    Find someone to trade cash for bitcoins in-person through a local directory.
    Participate in a mining pool.
    If you have a lot of mining hardware, you can solo mine and attempt to create a new block (currently yields 25 bitcoins plus transaction fees).
    Visit sites that provide free samples and offers.

Tell them about agents and the device2device economy. Its about the concept of ownerless devices. As bitcoin does not require you to register with your identity anybody can own them. Not only people but also devices. Say for example the google automatic car. If this car can own and spend bitcoin it does not need an owner to pay for gas, insurance and repairs. Why? It can do it by himself because it owns bitcoins. Now imagine the gas station is automatic too, it buys the gas in bulk from autonomous trucks transporting gas and sells them to the cars. Here is a new economy absent of people. Of course you can make this idea work with just about anything drones, farmbots, refridgerators, bicycles, furniture, webservers etc. Use your imagination! I think this will create a very cool sciencefiction like aspect to your course.

What about mining individual transactions in a way that blockrewards are divided among the people that mined the transactions inside the block. It wouldn't prevent the 51 attack but does take away the incentive to pool.

Yes! it is possible, this is what you need to do:

4. Buy bitcoin enough for pay back + bonus
5. Keep the rest of the money

Since bitcoin enables devices to own money, they will be able to spend money. A quadcopter could for example buy products from a farmer robot and sell them to your fridge which in turn sells them to you

payment was really fast as in instant. nice to see it works this well :-)
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:37:53
Well not only can they take money, they can now spend it too
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:13:03
why dont you just remember the private key this is insane

Its an intermediary for 10k+ restaurants
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:36:13
Well maybe those things do not necessarily need to have owners. Maybe the fridge just 'lives' at your house.

The problem with national currencies is it's bassically a security risk. What if some other country wants to fuck up your economy, just buy that currency =&gt; deflation, nation starts printing money so inflation, mass dump it all again =&gt; hyperinflation. Boom fucked up the country without bombs. It's safer for governments to all just have bitcoins.

It's easy just use the blockchain.info API, it's JSON
 
example php:
 $hash = htmlentities($_GET['hash']);
 $url = "
 $ch = curl_init();
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 0);
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30);
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0);
 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0);
 $jsondata = curl_exec($ch);
 if (curl_error($ch)) die("Connection Error: ".curl_errno($ch).' - '.curl_error($ch));
 curl_close($ch);
 
 $arr = json_decode($jsondata); # Decode JSON String
Also check the bitcoin deamon api
 assuming you're able to install it on your hosting platform

Yeah spending is the best, holding it leads to declined merchant acceptance. In order to stimulate the bitcoin economy exchange fiat for bitcoins just before you spend them. Merchant's be like whoah bitcoin sales goin up, I need to tell my merchant friends about this!
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:38:23
why does the database need money? would it be centralized? why do the miners get to vote. Why do you want to encourage spending? Cant you see its making the earth die! gg&amp;%53gfdk

The manipulator intentionally cause priceswings to happen. Speculators cause them because of greed and feer.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:40:58
Thats nice, if you buy from a cheaper exchange just to spend it on food you basically get a discount right?
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:35:45
We'll deal with it when the problem is there. Lets take over the world first.

I did the small debt thing today and gave my gf and mom 0.5 bitcoin. At the office I keep harassing people with price updates and asking them if they bought any yet. Managed to get at least 6 people to buy bitcoin. Most of them want to buy but think the price is too high.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:44:49
cause = massive increasing hashing power. Bitcoin took 4.7 yrs to reach 1Ph in just a couple of months after it reached 5 petahash.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:21:58
Why the fuck do people keep asking this question, why did you buy it if you don't know what 2 do with it? Do you always just buy some random shit and then ask yourself what to do with it?
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:29:18
engrave the private adress into the trees, then watch your money grow

What would you pay for an ounce of gold you couldn't sell again? That is the intrinsic value of gold.

The only way to solve this human rights problem is to automate the production of all our basic needs(energy, food, housing, clothing, water purification, etc) and give the product away for free. Bitcoin is NOT going to solve any of it by itself and might even make things worse.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:47:05
no we are goin vertical man!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:40:52
make it a fun site like 9gag but for bitcoin humor and make it so people can tip good jokes!
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:02:45
if you are a s-curve guy put them in multiple paper wallets for offline storage. Best is to make dogtags with private keys. Place one half of the private key on dogtags from company A and the other half on dogtags from company B. Or just buy the dogtag embosser yourself so you can make them yourself. Store them in a safe place like behind electrical sockets. A safe is the first thing a thief would steal. 
If your a bubble guy cash out and do what you want with the money.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:16:04
well looks like there's some serious issues in the mining software. Is there anyway we can help?
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:08:02
and you shall be rich because of this!
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:03:11
I think its normal right now considering the recent massive increase in hashing power. A more powerfull network means more value and thus higher prices.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:45:46
there is actually an api in bitcoind 
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:29:51
convince me this is not the s curve
