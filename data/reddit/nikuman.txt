I actually had all of my crypto money in bitcoin until a couple of weeks ago and then did some research about the whole block size debacle which opened my eyes to the very strange religious-like fervor that some people have for bitcoin/bitcoin cash. That combined with the enormous fees and long confirmation times have made me sour on bitcoin, and I'm sure any one of those things have made others sour on bitcoin as well. 
The fact is the only advantage bitcoin has is first mover advantage - people are starting to realize other coins have more potential as currency, stores of value, contracts, etc. in combination with lower fees and faster transfer times. Bitcoin may be able to catch up with some of the coins with updates or forks, but by that time it will probably be too late.

I am thinking it will bottom out at $4k-5k. All the bitcoin crashes lose 35 - 80% from all-time high. ATH this time around was about $20k, so 80% off would be $4000.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:22:29
This isn't about emotions, it's pure numbers. The op said it had dipped "tremendously" since he bought at 15.8k, because for him, it had gone as low as 11000 since he bought, or more than 25%.
You responded it had gone from a 1530% gain to 1500%. Please tell me you understand that those figures are totally irrelevant to OP.
Let's take it to the extreme to illustrate the point. Suppose bitcoin crashed tomorrow and was suddenly worth $10. By your line of reasoning, it's wrong to complain about that loss because it's still up 2000% from when it was worth 50 cents. You see the problem now?

Obviously the experience doesn't match what everyone says. For some reason, the transaction keeps getting broadcast. Instead of everyone saying that it should drop in 2 weeks, perhaps someone should explain what's going on? My guess is nobody really knows except for the bitcoin developers or wallet developers. Clearly, there needs to be better mechanisms for unconfirmed transactions. Ideally, they should drop off in a few hours if they don't confirm, not 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:37:24
No one cares about the gains from January 2017 if they just bought in at $15k. Most of the new people who bought bitcoin in the last couple months are speculators who hopped on a bandwagon to try and cash in. They are going to be disappointed if it doesn't gain.

Wouldn't that require having a string of characters that's the same in every address, and then making sure all other cryptocurrencies do the same and all agree on how to handle it? Seems like too much coordination between too many players.
Some do have messages that say sending to a non-BTC address could result in loss of funds.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:27:50
I did sell mine. I think bitcoin is gonna hit 10000 again before it hits 20000. The fees and transaction times are a real bummer - if it wasn't for that, I'd probably still have some skin in the game. As it is, though, I've moved everything from BTC to other coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:32:18

They didn't really lose anything. If they sent money to your closed account, they got it back.
If you got back the same amount of Bitcoin that you tried to sell, then someone else paid for it, not coinbase. Lucky for you, the price went up during those 7 days
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:50:57
Everyone judges from where they bought it. Someone who bought at $3000 is up 500% about now. On the other hand, someone who bought in at $16000 is down about 6%. The only numbers that matter are how much it cost when you bought it, and how much it's worth now.

Not all cryptocurrencies have fees. Congestion on the system is due to not enough transactions being able to fit into the blocks at their current size. The bitcoin community has been debating this problem for years. Bitcoin Cash or Bcash, was forked because some people think increasing the block size was the only solution (Bitcoin Cash has 8MB block now compared to Bitcoin's 1MB), while others have proposed solutions like Segwit and Lightning Network to handle more transactions without forking Bitcoin.

The technology of crypto is here to stay. An immutable ledger has a lot of value, and that value is only just beginning to be realized. It's difficult to know if any cryptocurrency will get widespread usage, but many of them will surely get niche usage beyond what we have today.

I was hoping BTC might be doing me a solid with its long confirmation time, but no, the price has dropped $4k since I put my transaction in. I still think it's gonna drop to around the $5k - $7k level and then steadily leak value until the next bubble.

yes it could, you don't need everyone to sell for it to be worth zero. And some people may be using suddenly relatively, just like bitcoin "suddenly" shot up to $19000, even though it has been climbing for months.

This is a gamble that the price will be more than $50000 by the time the option is. If it reaches $50000, they still lose money. If it gets to $100k though, they can buy all those bitcoin for $13.75 million, and will have made an easy profit.

I don't get the bubble denial. It was an obvious bubble. It came and went pretty quick, but it was a classic bubble. And bubbles certainly don't usually go to zero. The real estate bubble in mid-2000s is a good example. House prices skyrocketed and when the bubble burst, houses didn't go to zero - they just went back to a more normal trajectory from before the bubble. It's not a knock against Bitcoin to have been in a bubble - it's a result of greedy investors becoming irrationally excited about making money. Bitcoin as a technology is still there and still attracts investors as before. Just like houses today still attract many investors and people still make money investing in real estate.
I can understand your optimism about bitcoin, but when you deny basic observations, you're not doing yourself or Bitcoin any good.

There's a long history of beef between Bitcoin users who want bigger block size and those who wanted block size to remain small. Which led to the Bitcoin cash fork in 2017, as well as the creation of two different subreddits. Judging by comments in this chain, most people don't know that history, and so they just call people names and pass on misinformation. The truth is, proponents of Bitcoin Cash have some good arguments, but let's be honest - most people just care about the coin price, not technological debates.

Remittances are only really useful if someone gets paid in bitcoin and the receiver can use it to buy most of the things they need. The fees in converting fiat to bitcoin are pretty close to using traditional means for remittances, and can take just as long if not longer. I haven't heard of many people getting paid in bitcoin - it would require a massive shift in thinking and some long-term stability for that to happen in a meaningful way. To my other point, we can buy many things with Bitcoin, mostly retail merchandise, but there aren't many places you can pay rent or buy groceries with bitcoin directly.

I think the recent bull run has triggered enough interest so that 4000 is a new low. A tipping point was reached so that all major investment banks are getting into crypto which will result in slow long term growth as more and more people buy in. It's still volatile enough to see 10% swings (the swing amount will also get smaller as more people buy in), so unless multiple damaging events happen in quick succession, I don't think it is getting much lower than it is now. On the downside I don't think we'll see quick swings upward either, unless major positive events happen.

I think you mean deflation.

Both numbers are helpful. Many people don't care/understand satoshi per byte - they just wanna know how much it will cost them to send money without doing any calculations.

Cryptocurrency market could crash to $50 billion in 2018, some experts have also said.

There was a post exactly like this a week ago.

It's way more difficult to make a claim about a debit card transaction than a credit card.

Ahem..  I'm a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but to call people illogical when there is obviously an impact on card prices is being a bit obtuse. Nobody is attacking you personally. These gamers have different priorities and view the crypto craze as an opportunistic gold rush fad that will fade away with time. There is some negative aspects to this growth after all.. huge energy consumption for one is very disconcerting.

it's negative?

I worked fast food once, half the employees were lazy bums, the other half did 95% of the work

haha what? driving an economy? bitcoin is still not useful for much. There's a lot of potential, but the amount of resources it's using is not in line with its current importance, which is very little.

I don't think the author understands what "on-chain" means. Bitcoin Cash made block sizes bigger so that everything is still on the blockchain. Lightning Network moves transactions OFF the main bitcoin blockchain to side-chains. 
They also said that Bitcoin fees are essentially lower than Bitcoin Cash, when the average transaction fees yesterday were $2.15 for bitcoin and $0.19 for bitcoin cash, about 11x less.

Investing already has terms for this, you know.

cut the bullshit. No one has any idea where this thing is going. It could rocket backup $3k tomorrow or drop $3k just as easily. It may be worth $100k in a couple years, or $0 in a couple years. It's literally just guessing at this point.
If you want a safe investment, pick something else besides cryptocurrency. If you are not risk-averse and are intrigued by the possibility of a big payday, invest in Crypto.
