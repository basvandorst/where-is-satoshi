So we've been on the moon the whole time already O.o

Great idea
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:45:03
True if it's worth anything at that point
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:37:21
Yes true, good point. However I'm wondering what will happen when bitcoin goes to let's say 1m$. How do we know there are no bad actors and how could they impact bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:40:02
Nevermind I'll wait for others to reply. As with most things the price today is based on the projected price in the future, if not it's being controlled by someone/something. I'm trying to understand what the bitcoin ecosystem will look like when it's bigger and how it will function. As I'm trying to understand my risk and this fascinating market. Yes, they could only sell each bitcoin once, but with a big supply they could be able to profitably affect the market and increase their supply, something I suspect to be happening now. This UN report about North Korea hacking exchanges in the past (Mt gox?) just caught my attention and got me worried. Thanks for your replies

They do not control the money supply though. (people (CT) could argue against this I guess) . But it would be extremely difficult if not impossible for the wealthiest 1%  to affect the price of a dollar or euro. Controlling assets and money supply is something completely different, I think, and has other implications. I'm trying to understand this. Big accounts, I think, do matter and  who the big accounts are also, for this reason. What if they have bad motives.

Ok so what improvements have happened the past 2 years with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:57:54
The weather on Mars doesn't concern me. The weather on Saturnus doesn't either. Equal or fair distribution concerns me cause it effects the price of all other bitcoins. Big accounts could act like central banks in the best case scenario, in the worst they could make it worthless.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:51:48
Could be true. Haven't seen any "commie" countries succeed. One could say that's caused by bad leadership and wrong incentives, but I guess that's talk for another place. The scary thing is noone knows who they are and their motives. This is my problem. Check out the link I added at the top.

Thanks a lot for your in depth reply. Most I've known about but some I have not, I will definitely check everything out. I don't think most of these tools are being used a lot but I could be wrong and I'm probably not looking in the right places. It does not really matter to me. I understand the significance and importance of these updates and the research, but my main concerns are that I think this is not really useful for most people and wont be enough for Bitcoin to onboard new users and to keep its edge against other cryptos. Im not saying Bitcoin will fall or become worthless, but these developments won't attract new users and are also not targeted to do this. This development could be used in other projects, but more importantly other projects with more use cases will attract more users. My opinion could be changed on this, just not convinced now.

True. Exchanges are a big part and are not really a concern.  Except if theyre not secure. What would happen if binance/coin base were hacked for 250k bitcoin? Like Mt gox and everything goes to one person. 
I do think and know that there still are individuals that own big %, does anybody have a breakdown? I know there was this breakdown circulating on bitcointalk a couple years ago, can't find it anymore. 
Noone knows the motives of unknown whales and I don't want to assume they'll act in our best interest. I'm not trying to finance North Korea for example.
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:03:48
Thanks. Will look in to this and research it more. This stuff kind off gets buried on reddit. Your reply adresses my problem exactly :)  Looking forward to the updates, and to see what people do with it, I guess time will tell. 
Btw your replies deserve a post of their own as I think most people are not aware of this/ is not talked about enough. And generally I think discussion on this sub and Bitcoin twitter should be focused around this more than the beefs with ethereum/bch/whatever. I guess people are just too invested/love it too much. Last question: why do you say/ imply Ethereum is not decentralized? (serious question)
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:47:30
Yes updated
Edit replying to your edit: yeah I agree, bitcoins impact is undeniable. But compared to other crypto I don't see why it won't loose it edge over time. They have nothing going for it besides the fact its the first.
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:13:27
Yes but that doesn't mean that doesn't create a risk to big for most to enter.
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:35:51
Yeah so it could only be worse than I stated above?
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:13:49
They don't control the money supply. I think
I could argue that a system with players owning %s like this, &gt;1%, is more unequal than our current system

Welcome to the party
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:18:18
I'm just asking a question no need to get offensive. Let's say 1 bitcoin is worth 1Million Usd.
 What I meant was that big accounts could act like central banks by increasing or decreasing circulating supply. Which affects the price per unit. Central banks, generally speaking do this in a controlled manner. Think about what will happen if Satoshis, 1mil btc will move?it will drastically affect the price. This is why.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:31:31
My point is, how could bitcoin be used by everyone (in the future) , if there are people with bags that big. $ or %gdp, however you want to formulate it. If these actors are bad, the consequences for btc holders could be extremely bad. Or not, I'm trying to explore this.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:38:52
True, but what if this is their way out
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:43:50
I agree with you that's why I'm discovering this topic, to make sure we're not going down the same path or an even worth. There are people in governments, or could be in the future, that act in the interest of the people. Privates controlling the money supply however would be much worse
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:45:46
Why would that matter.(being exposed) And people know what's going on, they just don't care cause it doesn't impact them that much. It's all about the money in the end
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:10:00
True, but if one would want to use this (bitcoin) financial system one would be in the hands of the big accounts. Which directly affect our money/investments/savings/loans.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:45:24
Im just a skeptic. I love bitcoin, just love the discussion about the future of it. Which way is this space going? I haven't seen that much big things happen in bitcoin since Aug 1 2k17. Just fights
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:09:35
Top keywords lol

Actually you could use bitcoin since like 2014/2015. Burger King only got added on there in 2017
