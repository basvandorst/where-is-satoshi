ok comments are welcomed if you can elaborate. my life has been affected by bitcoin. It could have been a different technology behind that wouldn't matter. I had plenty of use case in mind and was finding blockchain very interesting but it's never essential and you probably can always do better without it; Excitation is about bitcoin price;

Because I never wrote something before and I have no audience. People say it's good but not many share it. Just wanted to make it easier.

You have between 200 and 400M monthly user going to coinmarketcap.com. Imagin 100M people above the world accept bitcoin as good as gold and want to have a long term exposure of at least 2000$. That makes a price at 12500$. So as long as bitcoin isn't going away a price in the 5000-15000 range is quite cheap. Each time it reaches a new level, some cash out and that put strong pressure on the price. We went from around 500-1500 to 6000-21000 and many have cashed out for a while, it will be soon the end of the adjustment and the price will soon move upward again. Keep saving money you really don't care about and you're perfectly fine. Once people start to auto save monthly price will really go up like mad.

400M is nothing
