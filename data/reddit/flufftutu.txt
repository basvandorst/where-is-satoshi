Wood is also competing with gold. It has much more use cases, and it is in much higher demand. The only thing making gold more valuable than wood is scarcity, and psychology I guess.

Also, money, assets and stocks are being conflated all over the place.
Bitcoin is money,
Gold is an asset that used to masquerade as money.

In about 2 hours, the price per coin would be about $50k, after 6 hours we would be closing in on $100k.
In a single day, the fiat economy would be completely ruined. All companies without exceptions would be going bankrupt. No services would be available, and the grocery stores would be swamped with doomsday preppers.
All in the name of some massively overpriced bitcoins. A price that would be coming back down once you run out of paper

There is a reason I called Socialism a utopian idea. There is no path from here to there that doesn't result in authoritarianism. And even if there were, there would be no way to stay there without a totalitarian regime, inevitably consisting of completely incompetent fools.

There are some people who are open to things like that, but they are few.
I remember one guy at work just after we had a bitcoin ransom virus running rampant on our computers. He asked me how I would go about acquiring bitcoin in order to pay the ransom.
I told him something like "They can forget about my bitcoins, I'll rather give them my data"
He realized I had some bitcoin and kept asking me about where and how to buy some. Long story short, he bought in at ~$900 :)

As far as I remember, Electrum will allow you to "recover a wallet from seed". That's how you recreate a wallet. You need to do this for each of the wallets you have phrases for. You can give them new names in the process, it doesn't have to be the old name.
That said, if you want better security I would suggest you encrypt each wallet with a strong password and type that password down on the same paper as the seed phrase (Yes, you are going to forget that password pretty fast, even if it is an easy one, which it shouldn't be)
Spending coins will be less convenient now that you have to bring out the password, but security is better. 
Now, if someone manages to steal your wallet file they will have to crack the password in order to gain access to your coins. So again, the password should be very strong. The problem here is that you may not know that your wallet has been stolen, so the thief will have all the time in the world to crack it. 
When using Electrum you also want to make sure the computer is not compromized by viruses and such. You may consider using a dedicated computer for this, maybe a Raspberry Pi.
If you consider storing a considerable amount of money, you should be getting a hardware wallet, and also a cryptosteel or something similar.
With a hardware wallet, stealing the key, or hacking the computer is no longer an issue, now all you need to worry about is to make sure the seed doesn't get found or stolen.

I think a lot of people are thinking this, unfortunately it isn't that easy. Those countries are 100% capitalist countries. Free markets and private properties.
Socialism and communism implies that the government owns basically everything. Private property is not a thing. Every value produced and every invention goes to a centralized, top heavy bureaucracy that doesn't produce any value at all. A handful of incompetent people suddenly have a huge amount of money, food, real estate that needs to be redistributed. 
In a society like that there is no incentive to improve, or to do a good job, or to invent anything. You get nothing in return for doing that as it is all confiscated and redistributed. You don't get to decide where or how to live, instead you get a flat with 2 bedrooms after waiting in line for 8 years, _if_ you have 2 children.
Since there is no incentive to thrive, the amount of value and food produced goes down steadily over time, until the famine starts running rampant all over the place.
Medicine is constantly out of stock, and the quality of services and health care inevitably drops.
As the economy gets worse, politicians will start to cut and save on everything they can find, resulting in food getting rotten long before it reaches the people that needs it. Eventually, only a privileged elite gets decent food and resources.
Socialism is a utopian idea, only advocated for by people who has spent their entire existence in academia, or in the corridors of political power.
Not to say that capitalism doesn't have it's own set of problems, it certainly does. 
At the end of the day we need to find an equilibrium where concentration of power is kept in check. We need the resilience that a network provides.
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:47:33


First of all, we want to be able to afford it, and we can, easily. As I described in the comment above, socialism is not a cost-efficient way to get there.


We can easily afford this if we have competent politicians with real-life experience as well as experience from working in private sector.
In short, politicians job is to plan and organize common infrastructure, and to upheld fair competition and an even playing field for corporations. As the decades following WW2 shows, 10-15% income tax would be plenty to make this happen. Right now, massive amounts of tax money are spent on wars, bail-outs, corruption, inefficient buraucracy and secret projects hidden deep inside the conglomerate of three-letter agencies.


They could pay 10-15% taxes on their profits, but a better idea would be to give ownership of the company to the people working there. Skin in the game is something that works, and it is perfectly in the realm of a capitalist system to do so.

Here is what Trezor says about seeds


The conversion from private key to seed, and back, is a well known procedure and can even be done manually if you do the math yourself. Once you have the raw private key you can definitely import it in other software wallets, like Bitcoin Core for example.

Unlike capitalism, socialism and by extension communism are inherently parasitic. 
Every argument coming out of that camp is ultimately about how much and how fast to extract resources without killing the host.
The host is of course the free markets and the production of value. If the host dies, so does the communism.

Well, as a model I find capitalism to be a much better starting point than any other ideology. What we have now is the end stage of coroprate capitalism, which is terrible, and a result of concentration of power and resources.
This is also the issue i have with EU, rather than a centralized circus of fools, it should have been a network of strong, independent self-sovereign nations. EU should have been about using technology to create efficient and robust communication between units in a resilient network, not to concentrate power and to create a totalitarian regime of self-elected fools.
@_date: 2019-10-11 23:29:10
To add to this, organization is key. People in general are terrible at it, which is why we keep tagging along being abused by sociopaths rising to power.
Bitcoin could play a key role in breaking this bad cycle, along with the right tools for organization, boycotting products and refusing to work for a tyrant, no matter the cost.

Sure, but it depends on how you see it.
If you are invested in the blockchain, you follow both ups and downs. It just sits there. Personally I find it more unlikely for Bitcoin to crash than fiat.
(To be clear, I'm not arguing the current price is the right price to get in though)

I got the impression he created the password himself, from reading hes comment history. He even remember most of it
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:55:05
As I understand it he only needs to brute force the passphrase used to encrypt the key
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:31:33
If we are talking about a regular passphrase it should be doable to brute force it. But you shouldn't stress it. 18btc is plenty, but 7 days may not be realistic, especially since the most secure way to do this is to write the code speciffically for this problem, on a computer that is not compromized. It will probably take some time.

This seems to be what he needs. How does it know the decryption is successful, prefixes and checksums?
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:13:41
I think he has the complete encrypted private key, what he is missing is a small part of the password.
Look at the decrypt function here
If that is correct, it seems relatively easy to brute force the missing part of the password. Just keep trying possible password combinations until you get a wif that starts with 5 and produces the correct public key.
If he is infact missing part of the encrypted key, it's a different story I guess

@_date: 2019-09-18 19:06:26
The key might be complete, possibly missing the checksum at the end, or not.
Most of the passphrase used to encrypt the key is also provided.
Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems doable to brute force a small potion of the pw
