OK there is a link from Cuban travel site:

I wish he bitcoin would stay where it is for the next 3-5 years.
This would turn away the speculators and give the bitcoin back to the merchants who offer goods and services.

Great post, thanks.
The message is: BTC is or should be worthless for speculators. Anyone motivated by greed should go away. Real merchants are welcomed

If I can have all transactions of the planet in my living room it is not decentralized.
Scalability will be an even bigger concern as citizens of previously poor nations are now getting credit cards and e-banking.

I like your answer, haven't thought about side chains.
If two side chains want to exchange value, they will exchange BTC, right?

True, technology advances, but Third World nations are now all going on-line.

This is an excellent explanation. Thank you.
But a scale related to the transaction vloume is badly needed. For example:
up to 10 Satoshi expire after 3 months, whether spent or not.
up to 1000 Satoshi expire after 6 months, whether spent or not.
up to 100 000 Satoshi expire after 12 months, whether spent or not.
What do you think?

Chargin a % or BTC revenue would put you in danger of the death by starvation. 
To be fair, I always explain to the prospects that this is a marketing exercise in the first place which, in a case of restaurant, might get 2 or 5 customers per year. The owner will get some nice smiles from the passers by and even more smiles from the web community, which, however, is unlikely to fly to the restaurant.
Street businesses, unlike on-line business, can hardly profit from bitcoin implementation.

You are right. A BTC payment is so much sloooower then credit card. Can you imagine the faces behind you in the supermarket line when you keep waiting for the confirmation from 6 or 12 servers? (The checkout staff might actually like it)

Because the payments less handy then cash and slower then credit card.
A simple test:
You have cash, CC and BTC wallet in your pocket. How would you pay an ice cream? A hotel bill? A new laptop?
