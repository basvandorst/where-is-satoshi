So you only talk about bitcoin? But you're not allowed to talk about the price? God, you guys have gotten so uptight since the last time I've been around these parts. What do you talk about? Books?

Yeah that's because the language filter flags "Bitcoin" for some reason. Search my username EnvidiaPro. Luckily "BTC" isn't flagged.

I like cross play with Xbox players, but they aren't taking care of the PC side of the game too well. There has been a lot of big mistakes/leaks lately from Turn 10 and that has us worried about Motorsport 7. I'm sure it will turn out ok though. Luckily the game has run great on my system and get anywhere from 60-120FPS. Some people have a lot of issues for no apparent reason, but I understand there are so many different configurations of hardware and not everything is going to play nice with every game, especially since they locked the down tight with on the fly DRM decryption which I HATE. Can't even get into any of the game files. Not a fan of the microsoft store at all. Really wish they just put it on steam. They shouldn't try to compete.

I am ADDICTED to it. Such a fantastic game. While I love sims like Assetto Corsa with a wheel, Forza Horizon 3 is a great game to sit back with a control and do some racing. Just don't use a wheel. The game's FFB is TERRIBLE. As a PC player I'm very happy to be able to finally play the Forza series. Really looking forward to Forza Motorsport 7 on PC. I will even be able to import all my liveries since I spent the first month I had the game trying to figure out how the hell people made such logo's. Now it's second nature to me. I spend A LOT of time making logo's and liveries. It's really satisfying. I've made it to the Elite painter status so far.

Gotta love assumptions based on no ground at all. Reddit style! Congrats, you are now qualified to post in @_date: 2015-08-31 09:54:51
Amen brother!
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:29:16

Who attacked what?
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:47:16
Should have, but I'm new. Do you have any idea how I can transfer that amount or even slightly more if I have to? I tried withdrawing $3 from a bitcoin pool I used years ago, but it wouldn't let me! It's crazy. I don't care what the fees are on that $3 even if I can get the money I need. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:14:04
I actually made a mistake. The price was 0.02804515 and I sent 0.02804510. So would that be 0.00000005 that I owe? Right? I copied the price from the wallet address, but looking at the escrow shows the extra numbers. God that is SUCH a small amount!
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:21:02
I did and they told me to wait for the order to auto cancel....
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:33:08
Can i give you an address and give you reddits honor that I'm pay you back ten fold when I get paid this week? 
@_date: 2019-04-01 20:25:42
I meant that I accidentally sent 0.0280450

I'm trying to earn coins on coinify and EVERY survey disqualifies me!!! I'm answering them truthfully! AGH. All this work for a fraction of a penny.

Yeah well this hasn't been the experience trying to buy something with BTC. I guess it was my mistake, but why am I being prevented from sending a measly 0.00000005 BTC to complete the order? People are stupid and they will make mistakes like this. I don't have the money to buy the minimum amount of bitcoin even though I can afford 0.00000005 BTC. So now my order is just sitting there incomplete in escrow.

I'm not seeing it as confirmed though. If you click the link above there are still 0 confirmations. I've used this address about 10-20 times and it always reaches 1 confirmation within 15-30 minutes. There is something seriously wrong with this transaction. I've never seen multiple transactions on my unconfirmed page like that. It always only lists the one transaction that I sent in the unconfirmed, not 4 separate transactions like it's showing. I still can't send BTC either. Still get the same error message.

Man I remember when mining slush with my gaming computer making 0.1 almost instantly. Oh the good ole days
