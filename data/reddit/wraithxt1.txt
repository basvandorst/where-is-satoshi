I'd like to see how he came across that many coins, and if he's cashed any out yet.
It's a bit disheartening, honestly. Here I sit scraping my cash together, proud of my whole FIVE fucking bitcoins, and this guys tipping thousands. It's interesting to see everyones reactions to it. Of course everyone wants to have their dream come true and get an outrageous tip, so everyone is trying in their own way to catch his eye. Seeing this makes me absolutely positive that if I ever make it big...I wont tell a god damn soul.

Watching this happen live is absolutely infuriating.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:29:48
Congratulations! Enjoy your new life, and dont forget to stop in here every now and then!
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:51:40
That's not a bad set of links,  perhaps add something about mining and a description of relevant information about how bit coins work?
This is all info wed be compiling into a wiki/FAQ.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:30:33
Same here, then again I only purchased two coins from them.
@_date: 2013-04-06 07:39:16
So you're stealing power, got it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:02:30
There's no trend. Its a volatile market right now, its moving up but we are in uncharted territory on several fronts.
He's right, no one know what the next step it. It could keep going up, it could crash tonight. Can you really gamble with your mothers cash? Its something you really need to think about.

This subreddit is BEYOND a circlejerk, seriously. It's way worst than a penny stock forum with the constant shit comments because at least on those forums you cant downvote other opinions.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:14:25
Found this picture of the guy.
After he made that comment I've been reading his comments in this voice 
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:03:25
Certainly considered that. I figured it would be more fun to use them for actual products. If I can't do that odds are I'll be doing exactly what you suggested.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:42:20
Odds are I wont be there long on Sat since I have to drive home, but We can try to meet in the morning! Are you on the Amsterdam bitcoin page?
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:31:24
Spot on. A wallet for girls? Get out of here.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:11:09
A quick search didnt turn up much. I'm not sure what those stickers would even be called. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 10:05:17
I'm not sending a copy of my PASSPORT to some third party so they can "verify" my identity. How about coinbase just lets me send my bitcoins they way they had been doing for months before they decided to screw me over?
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:14:20
Exactly, whenever I see this shit on my front page I know to check the current price of bitcoin to see what it's at.

You're asking us to agree you should take your moms money and put it on the roulette table, on black.
No one wants your mom in tears because baby boy just lost their life savings and now mom has to live in pain.
Make it a smaller sum at the very least. I agree with the other posted that you're very emotional right now. Step back, think it over and come back to the idea. Just imagine what would happen if your gamble(and it is a gamble) falls through.
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:52:15
Hook me up too! I'm in Tokyo as well :D
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:00:15
I think bit coin will continue to rise in the coming weeks. That having been said, i think this is an awful idea. The risk here is putting your mother in debt, or having her not be able to afford her operation. Put your own cash into it if you believe it will go up and help her that way.
Too much risk...don't do it.
@_date: 2013-09-10 00:57:12
I'm moving to the Bitburg area of Germany in a week or so, I'll definitely make out of there!
Do you have many local places accepting bitcoin in the area?
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:27:33
How much did you lose before you won? /jealous, as I've just started mining again and only have .02 BTC. tempted to try my luck as you did
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:45:12
That sounds incredible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:53:21
I'm glad you at least saw some reason. Good luck, see you during the next bubble!
@_date: 2013-04-26 09:27:22
Reshare this somewhere they cant take it down from! It was a fantastic interview. There are a few people I sent it to who really want to see!
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:21:50
Either way, I think the blockchain QR code idea is great.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:21:03
I'll be there tomorrow with some BTC if you want to show some Americans about!
@_date: 2013-04-06 06:44:30
Good question, but had to downvote because of incorrect meme usage.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:38:21
That's an extremely good idea.  I'm willing to buy the domain and host the wiki if were serious about going forward.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:55:43
I've made four transactions with them. Each was fast and had no issues whatsoever. I'd recommend them!
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:14:22
I certainly cant afford to be down THAT many BTC right now. Glad you did well though, what a crazy time this is...
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:10:37
No one can answer your questions. The potential for growth is just as real as the potential for a crash. What happens if hackers discover a flaw in the software and everyone sells out? There are a million factors in the price of bit coin. You need to be considering other safer methods to help your mother. 
If you do this, make damn sure she understands you're taking a real risk. Have you heard people saying time and time again "Don't invest what you cant afford to liose"?
You *cant* afford to lose that money.
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:58:59
Holy hell dude. Do some research before getting yourself into trouble. The key is doing some research yourself instead of posting here asking for everyone to help.
Everyone figured it out on their own by reading....you can do the same.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:43:41
That's pretty comprehensive. I'm not sure a reddit one would bring much to the table for newbies. Perhaps just a FAQ would work.
@_date: 2013-09-08 06:00:28
I just used Mycelium twice at a bar/restaurant last night and it was instant. Very convenient, confirmations started rolling in within a minute or so.
@_date: 2013-08-29 07:39:45
That's not an excuse. If they're overwhelmed they shouldnt be wasting time on reddit.
I'm unable to access my bitcoins on coinbase because I'm outside the US, and refuse to send my drivers license or passport copy to authy to verify my identity. So now my bitcoins are useless to me until I can get back to the US. Too bad I dont live there anymore. 
Their support got back to me in two days with a "Sorry, cant help you".
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:54:39
You're not bad at it, it's just a bit played out.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:35:35
You'd think somewhere with as many people coming through would at least have somewhere to spend them! Oh well, maybe in a few years!
I still haven't made a real face to face bit coin transaction yet, I was hoping I'd be able to find somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:43:26
And you're downvoted for pointing out the truth. This fucking subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-30 01:28:58
This guy is a blatant shill for litecoin. He comes to ask a question and instead argues for litecoin throughout the thread. 
Bottom line: Its bitcoin for people who missed out on the early adopter phase of bit coin and are now trying to ride bitcoins coattails. If you want to be a part of that community, go for it.
