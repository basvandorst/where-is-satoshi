I swam in the ocean with in iPhone 5. After that I bought a Samsung Galaxy S4. I have NEVER felt so free. I can do what I want. The marketplace is essentially 100% open. I can do what I want with my phone. I will not be buying Apple phones again. Now if I can only get my wife and kids to understand why the iPhone sucks.

Where do you guys buy from? I use coinbase. They will arrive on Dec 11th it seems. I assume my price is locked from the moment of purchase... (it's a bank transfer)

Yeah I actually thought about that myself when I was posting. Good advice.

I have no idea what you mean... when people say bitcoin is in a bubble, they mean the currency by default.

Why this time??? I just saw the tanking.

I loved CoinBase's instant buy... recently I opened up a Vault of Satoshi account. Once I have money I will try buying there. It seems really awesome and I was verified in just 5 hours so it's off to a great start!

I also just purchased .30 bitcoin. Pretty excited. Although I also purchased 750 USD of XRP (ripple). It's purely a gamble on how high Ripple can go though.

Hah. Probably not. I guess it you look at it that way, this is really weird.

You missed a KEY part of the story. How many did you have?

AWESOME!!! I have never eaten at this place but I often walk by it when I am in Korea! Now that I have bitcoin I will totally spend it there!!!

Well said... I only joined the bitcoin world 1 week ago and purchased .3 coins. Now all I do is read stories about bitcoin it seems. I wonder if it would survive the U.S. finding a reason to make it illegal. It seems they have a lot of good reason to do this.

I bought yesterday, and it says .3 coins at the old price purchased. It says I will receive them on the 4th. I assume I will actually get the .3 coins at the price I paid... does anyone know?

Where do you buy from? I am coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:43:09
Is it your family?
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:41:44
Ahh I missed the "a".
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:38:16
Yeah but coinbase is still in units of BTC so I had to type in .7 to purchase. I don't want to think in mBTC if I don't have to!

Hmm. I have been on reddit for a few years. It seems that subreddits are for certain topics. I thought posting here about a bitcoin purchase was legit. What do you think the subreddit is for?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:35:34
People made it look like, or people thought, China had outlawed bitcoin. They made it illegal as a currency, but basically are going to treat it like a commodity... like gold. Which is actually good news. It seems that a lot of Chinese dumped and then other people panicked at the drop.
