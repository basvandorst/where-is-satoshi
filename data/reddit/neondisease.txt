"Fuck your due process; we're taking your shit and we can murder you if you try and stop us."
Ahhh, land of the free!

It's unusual, yes. But what is ILLEGAL about carrying cash? 
What law REQUIRES you to keep your money in a bank? Can you be sent to jail for closing your bank account and taking all your money home to hide in your mattress? It may not be wise, but unless there's a law against possessing money, the cops had no right to take this guy's cash.
And if they suspected he was up to something shady, why the fuck didn't the cops arrest him or even write a ticket???? They didn't even have enough evidence of wrongdoing to support a citation, yet they had enough evidence to rob this man of every penny in his possession???

Yup, "innocent until proven guilty" is a lie. The right to not be deprived of property without due process is a lie.


Yup, this is the "freedom the terrorists hate us for".

On that note: 
I always wondered how people who get exonerated after wrongfully spending decades in prison don't find and kill the people responsible for putting them there once they get out.
You can't steal someone's whole life and expect them to "just get over it".

especially because getting your money back will probably cost much more than the value of what they seized, meaning you're already at a disadvantage right from the moment you're accused.
Nobody is gonna spend $5,000 on a lawyer to recover a wrongfully-seized $200. And the cops know it.

Yeah, a confession kinda negates the whole "presumption of innocence" thing.

Cops can't be bothered with trivialities like "the truth" or "facts".

That's because I didn't buy it, I could make Bitcoin crash to $1,000 by tonight by simply spending a little bit of money on it this morning.

And just think of all the taxpayer resources that were wasted on this fishing expedition.
Burglary, assault, and rape victims are waiting for justice, meanwhile the cops are harassing people who have not broken any laws.
