33k in February sounds laughable until you see a chart like this...but I'm honestly just hoping to hit 20k.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:55:02
Simple solution, go back in time and buy pre 1k!
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:43:16
ETH is also near an ATH. 
Today is a good day. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:04:39
Good news for Bitcoin and any other coin they support. Bad news for all the people selling right now. 
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:02:08
Somehow this worked...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:53:01
Meh I haven't bought since it passed 13k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:42:33
They're jumping ship for anonymity reasons, which is why Dash and Monero have grown so much in 2017. You can no longer be anonymous if you want to purchase BTC through an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:46:19
Fuck coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:25
Honestly didn't think we'd be here until May or June.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:42:42
25K Pls. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:27:16
I think Ver is piece of shit. 
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:01:11
Saving this.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:48
14k plus now. The inevitable crash when all the get rich quick schemers drop out is going to make a lot of people sad. A lot of people are making piles of cash right now too though. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:48:30
Translation: I have a shitload of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:16:31
Washingtonian here. I can't wait to buy my legal weed with Bitcoin and Dogecoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:33:55
Just came in to say he's not wrong....and to read the whole article. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:50:59
Yeah, I'm all for personal liberty, until it becomes an issue for your neighbors and the general public. 
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:50:33
Eh, it's a lot more confusing, and requires more capital, but I wouldn't full on call it a scam.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:47:57
If course they're enslaved to the dollar, that's what we're all paid in. It's pretty hard to convince someone to take the money they've earned and invest it in crypto currency when most of the population still has no idea what crypto even is.
I wish more jobs had investment options other than a standard 401k or pension.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:54:36
Lol if we 100% by the end of the month I'm going to start research into time travel.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:19:03
What can happen will happen.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:24:04
Bought then, buying now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:26:50
Fuck I remember the first time BTC hit $100, and then quickly went back to $60 lol. That broke a lot of backs.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:17:13
Cuz he only bought 1 Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:51:10
Lol OK.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:01:21
I'm amazed at how many people get really into crypto and don't know this. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:29:28
I'm hoping it doesn't crash too hard after 10k. I'd hate to see a lot of the newer buyers jump ship because of a bad couple weeks.
Then again I'll gladly buy again at 7k or under... 
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:53:14
A lot of others are just ico scams sure, but several actually do more than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is just a store of value, there's nothing intrinsically special about that.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:28:04
"I bought in summer at 11k, please my kids need Christmas presents."
@_date: 2019-02-07 07:04:56
Not having ETH is pretty stupid tho.....
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:24:41
Every coin follows BTC, the entire crypto space flows like one giant investment.
BTC is only worth the most because it was first, there's nothing spectacular about it.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:24:49
Lol decentralized my ass, Bitcoin is susceptible to the will of a few whales, and participating on any reputable BTC exchange requires my ID and banking information.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:22:22
You think they just make cash out of nothing when people like OP want to withdraw? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:38:16
Exactly. It's almost as if Bitcoin is worth as much as people are willing to pay...or what they believe it's worth. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:44:49
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:35:40
1. Yes and no. It's easiest to get cryptos from exchanges, but you can also buy them directly from another person.
2. There are exchanges that take CAD, I'm American and don't know the best ones, so do a bit of research and decide what's best for you.
3. What you can realistically afford is the right amount to invest. No matter how much you put in BTC will always go up in percentages, so you'll always gain. Buy, and hold. Don't be scared of a dip, hodl it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:31:15
Hold BTC, use fiat to buy altcoins cheap, then if any make a surge transfer to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:01
...but when? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:35:10
Wipes brow. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:25:20
Lol no. I'd wait until 10k. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:28:51
Well there isn't much of a difference. Just buy what you can afford. If you can only afford a couple hundred a month do it. If you can afford to buy 5 coins now, do it.
There isn't a bad way or bad time to buy. Buy, hold, and only dump if you're comfortable with what you'll get. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:10:53
Buy any amount and hold. Or keep buying what you can realistically afford every month, and hold. If there's a dip or crash don't panic, Bitcoin has always recovered.
Dump it when you're comfortable with the profit. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:49:53
Sounds like it was written by a 17k investor. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:52:26
Good thing I have a whole *checks* 1.8 BTC then.  I can retire on time! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:12:02
Eth, and Litecoin have both seen a bump recently too. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:40:21
Not even back at 9k yet lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:46:33
I mean you're still feeling like shit if you bought in November/December.... 
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:26:17
It...it worked. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:57:29
IT'S ALMOST AT 8000!
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:08:11
pffffft who is this clown? I'm scared crypto will degrade the US stranglehold on international law, please make it illegal!
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:47:06
War is good for the economy :\ 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:39:20
I agree that it'll eventually crash, I just don't see it happening this year...I hope. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:08:00
I really need to start investing in bitcoin, it's like the world's simplest stock market. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:41:27
3btc should at least be 1.5k I think you'll be good...hell I wish I had that much to my name right now :\ 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:20:35
This right here. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:23:54
Nobody cares. Ouya will accept bat guano at this point. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:56:41
But it provides jobs, increases production and labor, requires massive spending on technical programs, and generates technology. 
Granted, we could do ALL of those things without killing people for no good reason, but war is a pretty good stimulant...which is probably why America has made it a national hobby. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:44:25
Rephrase: War is good for the economy...if you win. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:18:39
And to think I nearly bought 100 BTC a couple months ago when it was at $32 USD :( 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:42:46
I can't wait until the market crashes again and I can buy some for $30 again! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:11:15
Oh gawd...not the "all taxation is theft" argument -__- 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:22:45
The Silk Road isn't very happy about this price explosion recently...well actually all the sellers are ecstatic, but everyone else wants to kill the sellers.
