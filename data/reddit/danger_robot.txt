I bought in for just a very little bit after the 1K crash at right around 850 so I'd say all things considered that's a pretty accurate read. After that however panic seller flooded the market and it crashed hard so while I was upset I still feel I bought in where the real value should be at today if it wasn't for the gox incident.

Guys if the city of Louisiana can't build a *SMALL* flood wall(est to cost billions of dollars) to help protect the city from flooding because of erosion of delta waterways that travel through most of the city who the **FUCK** is stupid enough to think we can build a much bigger wall across the ENTIRE southern US border.
*Seriously* are Trump and the retards that voted for him really that fucking stupid?

And there is... Counterparty is a layer on top of bitcoin that functions just like that lol. Not to mention the full scale universe of altcoins that are gaining wide adoption. The fact that I can exchange it for any other major currency today with absolutely zero hassle is proof enough. 
How is bitcoin not a usable currency? Maybe if you're a backwoods yokel that might be true but for anyone even halfway interested in crypto it's been a widely used currency for years now.

This show is by a wide margin my favorite TV series I've ever watched. Eliot is a complex character and how the show mirrors the real world makes you become engrossed in his world and what's at stake.
