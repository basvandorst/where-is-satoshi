What causes rapid adoption? Desperation.

Take it to the bank ;)

If you look at the 5 year, there was about a 1500 dollar dip over the course of a week before the 20k run. I’ll wait for it to drop to 7k and reinvest before the weekend. Got out at 8,5 after two attempts failed to stay above 9k.

I’m a fan of your trolling. Keep it going.

Not bad.

It’s not about convenience. It’s never been about convenience. There’s a reason why Satoshi will never reveal himself. Protection. People want him dead because bitcoin is a way for people to survive economically without any centralized controller. Bitcoin is a steady, reliable, and uncontrolled currency. Satoshi knew another recession was on the horizon, possibly bigger than the 08 one.

They somehow forget to recall that Pablo Escobar and El Chapo had crates upon crates of USD funding their empires.

CrynanceCoin, amiright?

Right, but that’s how institutions like ETrade and TDA are going to do it. Rather than handling crypto, they let a subsidiary do it for them. Trading futures will increase the price regardless. They do the same thing with gold. You’re buying the value, not the actual gold. Doesn’t really bode well in the near term regarding adoption, but that’s coming slowly.

These are institutional investors. It’s not tens of thousands that are throwing 20 dollars into it every two weeks.

Centralized banks? IMF? World Bank? Federal Reserve? I love how you scoff at me saying “establishment” and then use the term “Wall St” in a similar fashion. What will drive this price up is those ‘shady’ ‘Wall Street’ institutional investors in pin stripes suits protecting their interests...not normal joes.

Watching the media talk about Bitcoin is like watching Congress talk about social media.

Anyone have a feeling like the bears keep driving BTC prices down to consolidate before TD Ameritrade/institutional investment hits?
Go down to “How to trade bitcoin futures on TD Ameritrade”. Says you have to have a *25,000 account minimum*.
Tens of thousands of investors with at least 25,000 in their accounts (potentially)? Yup. Buckle up. May see some drops into the mid 5s again though before the exchanges open for crypto.

What do you mean, why? You think the elites want to have a stable world currency and not fiat they can rig to make countries go to war or to cause country-wide recessions at will?
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:43:59
I doubt this will be a glowing summary of bitcoin. Establishment is pro-fiat.
