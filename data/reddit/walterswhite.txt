For playing blackjack I would recommend using betchain. I was actually playing blackjack on there a few hours ago. 
If you want to just gamble some btc and have fun I would recommend satoshismines. Be careful though that game can get addicting very quickly.

I faced a similar dilemma a few weeks ago, I found myself looking all over the internet on how to reinvest my bitcoins and I came across a promising site based right in Delaware called GigaCoiner Innovations. I deposited a small amount of btc about 2 weeks ago and have been earning a 4 percent interest rate every day since. I also love that you can withdraw your earned interest immediately which I have done twice now. I did have a problem a few days ago because my most recent deposit wasnt showing up but I emailed they customer service and the rep after 2 emails fixed it to the correct amount. If you have any questions feel free to dm me. 
P.S  reddit I have no affiliation with the website just a happy investor

What volume? Look at the monthly charts, the volume keeps going down as interests keep going down.

So what happens if you want a refund in say 2-3 weeks?

People who see the downtrend and all the bear flags and don't want to keep losing money. Hodlers are getting rekt right now. Would not be surprised if we break down even more before we get a bounce back.
