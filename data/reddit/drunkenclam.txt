I think we all know it isn't ideal, but there's a large segment now that can't appreciate what coinbase has achieved. They just haven't seen anything worse than coinbase.
That said, coinbase has a serious customer service problem, and that affects all of us indirectly.

It requires some patience. First purchase has to clear before you can make more purchases, so make the first one count. IF it gets cancelled by their fraud bot, send an e-mail to support and ask to be whitelisted. They will complete the original order if you ask.

SR provided escrow only (dispute mediation). They were never involved in exchanging. I don't know how big vendors handled exchanges.

Yes, but very few people want to use it as a currency right now. A BTC China survey of its users placed it at 5% of users. Gold isn't very useful as a currency these days, but it still has value. Same with bitcoin. 75% of BTC China users were there for investment/speculation. Bitcoin has massive potential as a currency, but it doesn't have the infrastructure or 'market cap' to support it yet. If we build it, they will come, but they won't come until it's built.

No. They'll still be able to initiate debits and credits with your consent (via ACH), but they won't be able to check your balance. That *might* increase the odds of your order being canceled by their risk algorithm, but that's just speculation.
