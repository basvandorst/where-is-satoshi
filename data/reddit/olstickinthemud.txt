Is it "actually" on the rise or is this another mass pump and dump move? I ask because all the other alts to BTC are also on a fast rise these last couple days.

Slow and steady? Its up almost 3k in what four or five days? Im skeptical that this may be a mass pump and dump operation.

All it needs to hit is 18k and I am even on the two grand I threw at it!

A year ago every crypto currency expert was claiming with certainty BTC would be worth 30k 50k 80k by the end of 2018 and that we would be able to use it everywhere. Yet here we are with BTC nearing a 3k value and a few crypto exchange kiosks in dark corners of malls.

I agree and believe crypto has a promising future, but it is still a long ways away. Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin etc just had a really unusual introduction to main stream pop culture. Over night everyone suddenly knew what it was. But no one really knew what it was and its purpose. Everyone missed the point and the value exploaded then imploaded as a result.

Thats how I feel. I got caught up in the buzz and sank a few grand into crypto and cashed out when it started to "correct". That was sheer luck and I look at it as a gamble. I think right now its split between a small pocket of people who legit want it to be a viable form of universal currency and then the rest who want to use it to make money under the current system. That to me is the failure of crypto. Also its proved over and over that it needs regulation and this wild west method just makes it a open easy world for scammers.
