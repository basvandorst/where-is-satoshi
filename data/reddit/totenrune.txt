I will be interested to see if it happens.  I just have a hard time seeing mass adoption since banks and credit cards already provide for the needs of average citizens.  Mobile phones filled a new need for instant communication, access to the Internet and whatever.  Bitcoin, while having some really interesting points, is kind of in competition to what people already have.  Who knows.
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:49:17
I'm not sure about the volatility these days but the other 3 are significant issues.     
@_date: 2016-04-10 16:28:02
What does the bitcoin ecosystem need to support growth?  A far, far better system to safeguard investments and wallets.  The system will stagnate at the experimental level unless it can attract average joe users who don't have to worry that one slight mistake or malicious code will cost them their investment with absolutely nobody to call or help.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:51:21
I suppose it's possible but I notice in the other threads about this topic that Greek bitcoiners still meet few people who have even heard about bitcoin let alone are interested in investing.  
  
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:57:08
Yep.  If enthusiasts with detailed knowledge get their bitcoin ripped off on a depressingly regular basis then I know I'm screwed with just a casual understanding.  I play around with tiny amounts but could never invest any serious money.
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:46:56
I understand your argument but you unfortunately make micropayments sound like a horrible idea.  Look at the amount of people who demand free things on the Internet now and steal pirated movies and music.   I don't think you will be able to convince that crowd as to why they need to take their free browsers and now start paying for content,  even if it's a fraction of a penny.
@_date: 2015-12-05 03:52:37
I would think banks would be very reluctant to trust large sums of money to bitcoin though.  I could see them developing their own blockchains since they have ultimate control over the core programming but bitcoin might still be a bit new for the more conservative banks.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:37:32
I see bitcoin settling into a specialized service for a niche market, specifically things that are typically purchased where anonymity is critical for buyer and seller.  I honestly don't see bitcoin providing the average customer anything new or useful that they don't already get with credit cards, debit cards and ordinary bank accounts.  Because of that I don't see a massive expansion situation within 3 years.  
As far as the barrier to entry yes, it is a critical problem that needs to be solved.  When I first pitched bitcoin to my wife she said absolutely no when I got to the part about no recourse or safety in the event of a mistake, theft or hack.  I suppose a centralized company could create an infrastructure of safety and ease for average customers but then you get into the question of why would anyone reinvent the wheel.    
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:12:40
This.  Bitcoin us going to have to create a lot of infrastructure around itself to give consumers the critical need of protection and ease of use.   Right now it has potential but is nowhere even remotely close to some mass adoption stage.  
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:30:04
This.  I honestly have no idea how bitcoin is going to get traction in the average user market after reading these convoluted lists of how to do even simple things with bitcoin. 
I know it's still early adoption but there is a long way to go yet.
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:37:59
I was under the impression that most bitcoin given away doesn't get claimed, this perpetuating the scam mentality from the uninformed general public.  Might be best to just be patient and let the infrastructure grow and let customer's come to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:59:09

Comparing bitcoin to the public not understanding SMTP sort of glosses over the fact people were never expected to invest their hard earned money in Internet protocols.  If bitcoin is to succeed there will have to be far more public understanding, acceptance and trust.

So Bitcoin is very popular with not much of a community?  How exactly does that work out?
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:36:58
I agree it's an interesting experiment.  I personally don't think Bitcoin will become mainstream since there are too many risks to users, especially theft and online scams.  I do think that eventually a business or government will create a new digital currency with customer support and safeguards that will make digital currency go mainstream.

How would a decentralized communication system allow proper voting?  Honest question.   It seems the decentralization would lead to more abuse and manipulation since nobody will be there to moderate or control the debate.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:49:44
It makes sense to keep merchants interested and the community growing.  The kiss of death would come if the current merchants who adopt Bitcoin see few people use it as a payment option.  Eventually current merchants will shrug their shoulders, drop the whole thing and move on.  New merchants will be reluctant to start accepting after hearing stories of low interest from the old merchants.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:13:40
Right now it's their number one thread. 
I believe the OP since its a fairly mundane story but yeah, it essentially boils down to "Guize!  OMG! It took a WHOLE YEAR but I finally heard another human mention Bitcoin!"
I respect the enthusiasm but it comes off as rather sad that this is a debate worthy event.
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:17:51
With respect, why is it "meaningless" for nightwatch4 to point out the price of Bitcoin has slumped today?  I personally find it very interesting this is occurring 24 hours after the first major advertising campaign.
Might or might not be a significant issue but I think it's worth discussing.
 
 
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:43:13
Thank you for setting that up.  I will be curious to see where Bitcoin goes in a year.  
I was genuinely interested a year ago but ultimately didn't invest because of fears of losing all by theft.  Too much risk and, quite honestly, too confusing.  I would invest if the US government regulated it and it were easier to navigate though.
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:10:52
Bitcoin will never get into widespread acceptance without consumer protections.   Period.   People have to have some way to recoup losses from scams, theft, hacks and fraud.
I was prepared to invest until I found out there is no way to get your money back if you get defrauded.  Screw that.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:10:21
The author does seem to make a lot of sweeping claims about market forces.  Pretty much everyone who made guesses at the end of 2013 got their predictions wrong.  In the fast pace of cryptocurrencies I would have a hard time believing a quarterly prediction let alone a full year.

I have been lurking here since December when the price was spiked.  I almost got into Bitcoin but held back and, quite frankly, am glad I didn't buy in then watch the price crash for the next year.  That being said I read this site every day to see where Bitcoin is heading.  I'm very curious to see if the idea of decentralization catches on or the GOX and Moolah kind of repetitive scamming sours the average person on the whole idea.

It does seem to be a Catch 22.  Bitcoin desperately needs merchants for growth but, let's be honest here, merchants don't have much customer demand or see much use right now.  That's why things like the football advertising are a good idea.  More in the public need to be out there asking merchants to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:12:16
This post is a dead on accurate explanation as to why Bitcoin customer adoption has flatlined.  Strip away the huge number of empty wallets and questionable transaction volumes and you are left with a smart, hard core base but most regular people simply not caring or seeing the need to jump in.

It can't hurt though.  Bitcoin user adoption is rather stagnant and the majority of people (in the US at least) either don't know or care about it.  A training course may be a good way to educate people, especially considering they will then be asked to invest their money in buying bitcoins.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:33:47
You have a solid point.  I think most westerners are absolutely inundated with ads, especially online, and most of us filter or ignore them out of habit.  A product or service that intuitively works and fills a need is worth far more then just another ad.

I know this is a debated topic but I would like to understand the disconnect.  The charts show soaring acceptance through transaction numbers yet few in the general public still have no idea what bitcoin is let alone use it.  I guess I would expect more people involved at this point.

I'm not trying to be skeptical or anything but I honestly don't get these assurances that decentralized blockchains will become widely accepted over the current centralized control.  I think many consumers will have a difficult time moving from the idea of a central entity safeguarding and controlling their money, documents or whatever to a vague decentralized plan.

I think the biggest flaw in the "it's just likes the Internet argument" is that the Internet and email solved a need.  It sucked having to go to the library or ask a friend any time a simple question came up so the Internet and Google searches was an intuitive solution to a problem.   Crypto currencies have a much vaguer need.  Send money to relatives in Kenya?  Maybe a need but how many people in the western world want or need this?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:18:15

I seriously considered  buying in at the $1k mark.  I got sucked in with the "to the moon" euphoria and didn't want to miss out.  I pitched it to my wife and got a solid "no fucking way."

There is a danger in not advertising though.  I personally think it's dangerous to simply assume widespread adaption is inevitable and a sure thing.  Look at the people today know about bitcoin but don't see a need or use for it.  Throw in misinformation and you could have a product that just fills a niche market and nothing more.   
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:22:14
Yeah, as desperate as the Greeks may get I'm not sure how ready they are to jump into bitcoin right now.  It could be a case of jumping from the pan into the fire with the bitcoin and altcoin volatility. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:40:55
Yeah,  arguing price doesn't matter does come off as kind of desperate.  How will bitcoin enthusiasts attract new users while trying to explain how the value dropped from $1200 to $170 (or lower)?
It seems like bitcoin was a hard enough sell to the average user before the crash.  Now the sales pitch just got harder.

There unfortunately is too much financial incentive right now to fake transaction numbers in the effort to make it look like more people are using bitcoin.  The sliding price and merchants reporting little interest speaks louder than questionable transaction stats.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:23:09
I would love to know how much of the current transaction volume is this.  My suspicion is that some holders, hurting with the huge price drops, are increasing transaction volumes to make it look like there is more interest and activity then is really going on.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:15:31

I see your point and guess it's a balancing act.  It just seems odd to me when bitcoin companies embrace (or are forced to embrace) centralized authority and regulations since it seems in direct opposition to the original intent of creating cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:28:36
Yeah, Xapo paying old guys to talk up bitcoin won't really do much for the price in the short term.  It may help respectability in the long term but people need to be actually using bitcoin to move the price.

I would argue more an issue if not catching on rather than dying.  It's been years and most people (in the US anyway) either don't know about bitcoin, don't care our don't want to bother learning how to buy any.  That may change one day but right now this a simpler explanation that some subversive government shill attack to destroy bitcoin.

Seems to me to be a case by case basis.  Religion and politics, or topics treated by someone to that level (like a healthy few in the Bitcoin community) are most likely a waste of time.  Even if your argument is completely right they will just hate you for not believing the same dogma they do.
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:14:24

The article points out that $375 million has been invested in bitcoin  companies this year.  Honest question,  has any of that led to any tangible growth or expansion in the infrastructure?   I guess I'm wondering where the money is going.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:47:41

Yeah, bitcoin is a much cleaner, efficient way to move money from A to B but I think many will have a hard time trusting it once they find out there is no way to fix theft, fraud and user mistakes. 
The banks and clutter in the middle of the diagram are create less efficiency but provide a valuable service of fixing problems when an issue comes up.  The modern western customer just expects that kind of service to be available nowadays.

I have a real hard time believing banks see bitcoin as their number one enemy when so few people even know about it let alone use it in any way that impacts banks.
Someday bitcoin may be a threat or even rise to a level to be a primary threat but let's be real here, bitcoin is still primarily at the limited enthusiast level.  
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:05:03
I would suspect so few people use bitcoin that it makes it difficult to keep customer service representatives trained.

@_date: 2015-09-11 07:15:37
That's kind of what I'm thinking.   A business that created their own blockchain would be able to control the updates, fundamental changes and whatever.   I may be wrong but I don't see large businesses simply rushing into bitcoin without having control of the core programming.

Exactly!  Just because cryptocurrency enthusiasts see the advantages doesn't mean people won't freak out when the find out there is no way to get their money back in case of a mistake, fraud or theft.

I concur with everyone else urging you pay off your debts first.  Bitcoin price has been stagnant for months and I doubt we'll see a repeat of the the massive, fraudulent manipulation (looking at you MtGOX) that led to the unsustainable 2013 bubble.

The majority of Americans don't give a crap about what Snowden did.  The guy proved massive, questionable surveillance on citizens yet people lost interest after a few weeks.  Thus the reason the government still conducts mass surveillance.

@_date: 2015-04-13 20:02:17
Lofty goals in the article but the community is nowhere near adoption by the general public.  Forcing it on people now, when scams, lost coins and theft is rampant is a bad idea.  Negative stories spread like wildfire and perceptions are difficult to change.

Honest question here.  Over the past few years I have read about these apps that will come sometime in the future where people use bitcoin without knowing it, boosting the overall use and price.  How would these apps differ from current, established payment systems?  It seems to me that even if someone builds an app they are just competing against monolithic names like PayPal or the glut of current, small websites.
@_date: 2015-09-13 19:57:31
I think bitcoin will have to first attract interest and users in first world countries with access to computers,  mobile phones and the internet before any kind of traction can start in third world countries. It's kind of silly at face value to think someone struggling to survive and get basic food and water is going to be interested in a high risk internet investment.

Who cares if they side with Snowden if they don't care to do anything about it?   What difference does it make if they support his actions or hope he dies in poverty in Russia?  It's all the same - Americans found out about the spying, collectively shrugged their shoulders and went back to the TV.
I would guess that Snowden probably hoped for far more than people to "appreciate " what he did then go back to the status quo while he lives the rest of his life in Russia.

What free market?  This is one man declaring himself president of a barren stretch of 3 square miles.  I fear some people think this tongue-in-cheek declaration of a "country" is a real entity.

Hey, Armstrong PROMISED they won't use these legal patents against smaller, competitive companies.  What could go wrong?
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:46:05
Not only zero examples of companies who are doing this, but no explanation why any "financial startup" would want to do this.  Come to think about it I can't think of a dumber business model than for a small, new institution to loan money to high risk lenders.

That was my first thought as well.  Gavin comes off sounding kind of petulant, as if he would rather the entire system fail than admit his XT idea hasn't been well received nor anywhere near consensus.

I would argue that most credit card users are aware there is a large amount of fraud and theft but they want, even demand, the protection the credit card companies provide them.  I'm not too worried if a get fraud charges on my CC now because I know one phone call will get the charges reversed, my old card closed, a new card sent in the mail.  Bitcoin at this stage in development is unfortunately pretty much SFYL.  
I respect the libertarians idealism of everyone being their own bank but think an overwhelming majority of first world people don't want or care about that.  Right or wrong they want the comfort of knowing they can rapidly call someone to fix a theft or screw-up.

That actually is the best explanation of price fluctuations I have read in a while.   Far more informative than goofy chart interpretation or assumptions that a small news story is moving price.

Well, the bill says the state shall accept a third party payment processor to handle the payments.  It sounds the same as the bigger business names that accept bitcoin - in the end they really accept cash and someone else deals with the bitcoin.

I was confused about that point as well.   What is the purpose of an encrypted phone where every transaction is then visible on a public blockchain?

Probably not a consumer technology for widespread global adoption or some of the loftier goals I've read of replacing all fiat currency.  That being said I think it's definitely valuable for niche markets used by people who are willing to spend the time to learn about it and accept the bitcoin's risks for the gains of anonymity.   
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:55:02
The number of people trading bitcoin is still pretty small therefore normal buy and sell orders will cause relatively big fluctuations.  It's not so much manipulation as it is normal market forces in a small trading world.

The people warning of just another pump and dump cycle did seem to get quickly drowned out by moooon and estimates of 700, 800 or 1k by the end of the year.

Calling bitcoin a "megatrend" doesn't seem like a position the typically conservative Goldman Sachs would take, at least not at this early stage.   I would like to see the information directly from them an not an unsourced comment next to a stock Goldman Sachs logo.

Do these machines just take customer's money for bitcoin or do they act like a traditional ATMs and give out cash?
@_date: 2016-05-01 19:41:46
How about using the money to market bitcoin so people will actually use it or give you something other than a blank stare when you mention the name?
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:37:39
Sounds like they are trying to do the right thing.  Making it difficult for criminals to offload stolen coins benefits the entire bitcoin community.  If everyone just sits back, shrugs and says "sorry for your loss" then who knows how many people will avoid bitcoin out of fear of theft?
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:46:13
Not to be a pessimist but let's be honest here, this isn't really big news.  A bitcoin company, Noble, decided to lease a trading platform similar to what is used by big traders.  You can't really expect a valuation increase over something so relatively trivial.
Yes it shows the bitcoin environment is maturing and at least one company is using the same technology as the big traders.  I just don't think it will get anyone to run out and buy bitcoins in and of itself.

Um, I'm not sure enthusiasts would agree with calling bitcoin a financial black hole.  :)
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:25:10
Eh, it sounds kinda scammy if the name bitcoin needs to be hidden already, like Scientology or Amway using alternates so people don't immediately tune it out.
If the foundations are sound then bitcoin shouldn't need to be embarrassed about its name.
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:10:31
The problem with creating bitcoin banks is that people will increasingly ask what the point of bitcoin is supposed to be.  We already have fiat banks with efficient, safe, easy to use services.  The question will be why bother switching?

I've last track of how many people have expressed their frustration at going to a businesses listed on Coinmap only to find out they stopped accepting bitcoin months ago due to little our no sales.  Maybe more use will prompt people to update more often.

So the bitcoin trading company Nobel agreed to lease Nasdaq's X-stream technology for their specific trading platform.  Honest question here, how is this embracing bitcoin?  To me it's kind of like a random company using MS Word and then arguing Microsoft is embracing the company.
Some of these articles are so over the top, so loud in shouting "MOON!," that it makes me wonder what is specifically happening and what actual impact it has in the community.
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:19:34
Let's be honest here, bitcoin will never reach a significant level of adoption with the mass public until there are assurances and safeguards that one screw up will not permanently and irreparably cause you to lose all your money.  I understand wanting to be a purist and reject the state at all levels but it's not going to happen for most when money is on the line.   
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:15:38
Honest question here, how exactly is a group of banks looking at the feasibility of a private ledger "embracing bitcoin?"  I understand they might like the idea of a blockchain but even if the banks do create their own system I can see little to no impact on bitcoin other than bragging rights of being the inspiration for the bank's new ledger.  Am I missing an indirect connection?
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:25:00
To be fair to the businesses though they seem to get little to no actual bitcoin sales.  I can't blame them for opting out after a few months.   The push needs to be for users to actually spends their coins rather than sit on them IMO.
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:18:24
What about the constant accusations of mining companies creating artificial trades to inflate volume?  It would seem a better gauge of adoption would be people and businesses actually using it which, by all anecdotal evidence, isn't that great right now.

Appreciate it.  It sounded like that was the setup but I didn't know for sure.

A little over 2 years ago I set up my PC to mine and that alone was turning out about .25 bitcoin a month.  I ended up stopping it after a week since it was a constant drain on my computer though.  I looked at a mining rig but figured the rapidly increasing difficulty would make it a bad ROI.
@_date: 2015-10-03 14:44:46
That is a fair argument.  I see the potential of bitcoin but I guess I'm just skeptical of these charts showing huge increases in trading volume.  If they were true I would expect to see more people using bitcoin rather than getting blank stares when the topic gets brought up or reading about restaurants/businesses dropping it due to low/no users.

Well, if we are truthful the real problem is that most people wouldn't have the slightest idea what they are looking at.  You could bold and underscore "private key" and people would still ignore it.

In this case staying in fiat isn't really a delusion.  It's just far simpler, efficient and safe to use fiat, credit cards and debit cards.  You really can't get pissy at people who stay using the better system right now.  
When cryptocurrencies matures in a few years things will likely change but right now there is a lot of room for development and expansion. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:10:47
Exactly.  I'm not too impressed with bills that push to make it easier to throw money into the gaping maw of the tax/spend machine.  Get back to me when a state specifically does something to expand crypto innovation or ideas.

Yeah, I'm having a real hard time believing almost 10% adoption in 12 months when other polls show a huge section of the US population don't even know what bitcoin is.
I can see smaller, tech savvy companies trying it out with a third party like BitPay but 8%?  Not likely.

Considering the huge price slump and MTGox fiasco I don't think 2014 was a good year for people to be learning about bitcoin.  It's rather difficult to change people's opinion after they decide something is bad or not for them.
