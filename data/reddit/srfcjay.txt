How do the hardware wallets work, they store our bitcoin and when we want to sell bitcoin how would we go about it using this?

I'm new to bitcoin so sorry if this sounds a bit dumb. But when this device stores the keys, if I go to sell bitcoin to an exchange I will be able to sell it for the price that it's currently worth when it rises yes?

So it’s basically impossible for me to be profitable mining bitcoin then? What ways to other miners stay profitable?

So would you recommend keeping them on my trezor then after the fork wait till I’m clear on how to sell my B2X?

I bought in September at €4000 2 days before it dipped to €2500. Feels bad but I just held and watched it bounce back ever higher. We will be fine just HODL

40k is how much I’m willing to spend to set it up if the full rig starting off costs 20k to set up fine I was using that so if people had any other suggestions to would know what budget I had.
Also I did look it up and it says each one would be profitable. But I was looking for someone who mines for some pointers on mistakes etc I might make setting up and stuff something a calculator will not tell me.

I’ve explained it to them, they know the risks and they would still rather take the risk with some money in bitcoin then putting it in the bank with poor interest rates.

I bought 4 coins in September at €3800 the day before the dip. The next day they were worth €2500 each, couldn’t believe it but kept the faith and the price bounced back and I’m up now. So just HODL

Thank you, that’s much handier I was hoping I wouldn’t need 1 tresor per person
