Stupid analogy. We are buying more at discount and the amount of bitcoins we have is either the same, or rising (with decreasing unit price). So all is good.

Nothing is changed. The amount of satoshis in a wallet is the same. Why all that drama?
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:28:08
It could be better to offer to pay for a trezor that will be shipped directly from SatoshiLab. Otherwise I would not trust the device.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:10:22
Lightning Networks will even further facilitate that. Plus Litecoin could help further.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:37:31
Do not forget to try with a tiny amount of krypto. Create a wallet, write down the seed, send a tiny amount of crypto there, delete the wallet. Install it, restore from the seed, see if it runs smoothly. Make copies of the seeds and store them in different good places. Be paranoid.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:18:58
Repost from another thread: ShapeShift is now boycotted by all normal users. Shapeshift got in bed with Roger Ver and his shitty btrash, used the scammer's terminology: Bitcoin Core instead of Bitcoin, linked the scammy bitcoin.com web etc. Use other services.

@_date: 2018-03-22 23:30:48
If it is on your PC it is not a hardware but a software wallet. Do not forget to write down the seed words—it is the most important thing. If something happens to the pc's HDD, you can still access your crypto through restoring the seeds on another computer/mobile phone/Trezor.
But. Trezor T allows for creating the seeds, entering passphrases, PIN protection—all of that without the info ever leaving your Trezor. So it provides the highest safety standard for now.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:05:32
not "bitcoin forks", but btrash's forks.

What is the exact proces of defragmenting and consolidating dust? One simply creates an address, and manually sends all the small amounts from different wallets to this one address?
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:20:33
I don't get it. If you do not sell, your bitcoin balance is the same.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:31:23
Not yet.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:08:11
Oh, I see. So I have to send everything to one address and then send the sum to another address. Then it will be consolidated. Thank you for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:38:12
You were a victim to bitpay's suckiness.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:02:48
It is a whole point of bitcoin, that you can send and receive it without third party. You are your own bank. And remember, not your keys—not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:48:39
Thank you kindly.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:17:23
If you have a bigger value stored on exchanges etc (i.e. not your keys), then get a Trezor One, move it there. When Trezor T is available—buy it, generate a new wallet and move to a passphrased account there. Trezor T is a marvel. But for now only available as preorder (finished) or at ridiculous prices (and not safe) on ebay.
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:57:11
Trezor T.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:32:46
Don't hate. But no love here, because of btrash support.
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:58:42
And what about passphrases?
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:16:14
I would suggest Trezor T as a wallet.

What seems to be the problem? The number of bitcoins you have is the same. Just wait a year or two and the fiat will get cheaper again.

You can mine ethereum/equihash stuff on Mining pool hub, and autoexchange it to bitcoin. I guess it will take about 7-8 days to get 10 dollars worth of bitcoin. Beware of minimum withdrawal limit though. May be better to autoexchange to litecoin, then send it to gdax and exchange for bitcoin.
