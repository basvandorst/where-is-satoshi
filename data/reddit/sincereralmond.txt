Is it odd that I was just talking to my co-workers about this? They aren't very investor inclined... I suggest it will happen soon, but is soon 1 month, 1 year or 5 years? From the looks of it I call it about 1 year max...

As a starting business owner online; I have looked at the benefits to both stripe and paypal...
My funds get a frozen all the fucking time using payapl on very small transaction for up to a week. 
Both stripe and payapl have the same transaction cost, but strip is deposited into your bank account in 24 hours.
Paypal is more renowned for its secure pament methods, but the sellers hate the shit!

Something is wrong here, who has asked themselves if this is morally right? How many more rights will they strip from us until we say, enough is enough!
