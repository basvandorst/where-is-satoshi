because the hipters do not think and they think about themself as being GODS.
also, do not ignore that Bitfinex's owners can run with money and the so called hacked it can be dust in the eyes
we are talking about 60 mil usd. that means around of 15 mil each partner from Bitfinex.
It's not bad for 3 years of "work", right? I don't count the profit they made until now. :)
You can live a luxury life with these money without doing anything else.
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:24:56
correct ! This is what Bitfinex is doing and they earned +30 MIL USD in few weeks :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:00:53
Yes, it's better than zero, of course BUT how can you let the things like they are? I mean, someone has stolen 36% from you and you say" well, it's okay...that's it " :)
did you see any  financial statements/external audit and a detailed walk through of how the 36% dumbass tax rate was calculated? 
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:17:06
They won't because they are afraid of SEC :)
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:16:49
is it not amazing? they steal over 36% from 70 mil usd(aprox 23 mil) and they will continue the business.
nobody did any complaint. flocking like sheep! they are scared that they will lose everything if they do that:)
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:28:57
The company is from Hong Kong so any legal and normal company would announce the local law enforcement.
 This one (the police from HK) will contact other law enforcements from other countries if necessary.

I am making money since e-gold was alive. have you been born at that time, kid? :))
20K per year is OK for a kid . you have some pocket money for a movie and to impress a 18 years old girl  :)
I am just amusing how many brain washed are using BTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:18:14
the evidence is that Hong Kong police didn't receive any single information from Bitfinex about this so called "hack", Bitfinex didn't say a word with who is "co-operating"
"The theft is being reported to — and we are co-operating with — law enforcement."
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:46:22
"Offering Illegal Off-Exchange Financed Retail Commodity Transactions and Failing to Register as a Futures Commission Merchant" 
Please read "Offering Illegal"...
CFTC is a civil law enforcement and that's why they only order fines. Why did they fine Bitfinex? " For Offering Illegal Off-Exchange Financed Retail Commodity Transactions"
I hope it is clear as it's clear that Bitfinex doesn't own any financial license for their business. This is illegal too. By running an illegal business it makes your company to be ...illegal 
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:12:06
what's the amount that Bitfinex does have in their bank accounts? this would be a question because part of these funds belongs to the company. that means they can minimize the cut by covering the missing amount  to less than 36%...
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:44:55
CFTC is not a criminal law enforcement. it's a civil institution. 
MTgox was forced to deal DOJ because Karpeles itself had problems because it ran an unlicensed money transmitter.
so, any legal company would announce something like " we are working with the local police..." or anything like that. :)
Bitfinex said "law enforcement" . which one? from Zimbabwe? this is not a secret.
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:35:11
the whaleclub members are protecting the Bitfinex morons...
that's why you will see a lot of fishy posts who are defending the crooks.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:48:38
how can an illegal(not licensed) company to announce the police about this incindent? 
 the first question would be : 
"are you authorize to act as a forex/broker/exchanger?"
Bitfinex along others well know exchangers(Kraken, Poloniex, BTC-e, OKcoin and so on) are illegal services and they will never go to any authority to complain about anything.
Yes, Bitfinex owners will run with your money. Why? Because you used a shitty exchanger, with no financial license.
you didn't care about that and now, you are despaired that Bitfinex is playing with you.
BTC-e will be next. I saw people who are saying "BTC-e is an old exchanger and reliable". OK! Soon, they will cry on forums :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:18:56
sue them if you are not satisfied. it's your right
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:24:16
there will be brain washed who will continue to use this scam called , Bitfinex, even they lost a lot of money with this "inside job"("hack").
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:25:26
true !  of course, you won't sue for 10K or even 50K because the lawyer will cost you the same or more :) 
BUT there are so many with +200K...
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:44:57
they are buying valuable time while you are on reddit instead of filling a complaint with your local police or Hong Kong police.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:41:30
where did you see that? do you have any contract where it's written that Bitfinex will buy the tokens with 1 USD per token? :)
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:45:56
withdrawn the real funds from Bitfinex and then sue the morons from Bitfinex for the rest of your funds converted in tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:16:24
Phill P. said that NO WAY. So, they won't buy anything.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:11:56
great post! there are still people who THINK !
Bitfinex is a gang formed by ex HYIP runners and ex LR users. They are not novice at all.
They are coming from a world where "scam" is something natural. They stole 70 MIL USD and there are no complaints with law enforcements. More than that, I see "THANK YOU, Bitfinex"  LOL.
I think many from the brain washed who are posting here, have no clue what it means 1 MIL USD not 70 :)
I know that many won't believe me but this is the true. Same with BTC-e. They will be next. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:58:54
you would demand too if you would have millions in a shit hacked platform :)
Bitfinex didn't file any complaint. they are an illegal business who is running an illegal(unlicensed) forex/broker.
the police would start with them...
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:54:22
Bitfinex got a fine from CFTC for Offering Illegal Off-Exchange Financed Retail Commodity Transactions and Failing to Register as a Futures Commission Merchant.
In short, Bitfinex is an illegal company not only in USA. 
US was the first who took action but similar laws are in almost all the countries. 
All the forex/broker companies MUST be licensed.
That's why Bitfinex doesn't allow you to trade if you reside in US
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:14:52
I only see WORDS without any document/proof. do you see something else? :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:42:10
by paying a fine it doesn't mean that you are in compliance. 
I don't see Bitfinex registered with CFTC. that means compliance . :)
CFTC is a civil law enforcement and this is the most that they can do. to issue fines, warnings.
I won't argue with you because it seems that it's useless but in short "Any Bitcoin exchanger/broker MUST be MSB(have a financial license) in each of the US states if it wants to make business there "
Bitfinex doesn't even have one.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:41:08
right ! :)
the people behind Bitfinex, the real owners are not so novice. they are buying valuable times. they learn from MTgox and others how to avoid the "problems". 36% cut from 70 mil means around 25 mil USD...they made it overnight. 
now, they offer you "tokens" LOL... They laugh of you so hard because you deserve that IF you really accept their shits
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:39:53
they cannot ISSUE share to public at all :)
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:14:52
Willy bot is in action; fake volumes as usual. 
all the exchangers are doing the same but some of them have common sense and they limit these volumes... :)
Bitfinex has nerve and they are pumping the transactions...
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:49:41
those who accepted the "deal" with shit tokens. i didn't see any real legal complaint until now. i didn't see VOICES to demand an external audit, I didn't see MENS :)
Instead i saw, whining sheep "36% is better than nothing, maybe we will recover the rest in few years"
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:32:31
very good. this is what a normal people should do.
more than that, if you are in HK, make the complaint in person not online.
Bitfinex will distribute the loss with all its clients LOL  
So, the ones who still have BTC in their accounts, they will give it away to "others".
I am wondering what it will happen with the clients who had millions in their accounts :)
will they receive like 10 BTC? :)))
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:18:37
you are VERY lucky. you can go in a bar to drink for that. 
I know people who lost hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2016-08-13 19:50:14
OKcoin is known for their shit business(with fake volumes and price manipulation) and also, all the chinesse exchangers are somehow out of law. 
1. no financial license as it's required by the Chinesse Law.
2. china gov banned all the financial institutions to deal with companies who are using Bitcoin. normally, the banks from China should ban all the chinesse exchangers.
@_date: 2016-08-01 10:14:48
well, there is a seed of truth. cryptoshit is hard to be understood by the common persons.
try to explain to an average person(I am not saying to a stupid one) about miners, sha256, exchangers,wallets and other things and you will see their reactions.

what's the Bitfinex's BTC account from where the funds were stolen? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:11:45
of course, there is an expensive lesson that you cannot keep money into an UNLICENSED, ILLEGAL company.
on the other hand, if you are daily trader, how can you make money if you don't have funds into your account?
many of these people were used on real FOREX companies where you can keep millions without any problem.
nobody is stoling them. :)
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:40:50
the Bitfinex's clients are like sheep. they are afraid of losing what? they lost 36% from their funds already. Withdrawn your funds and file a suit. The court will reveal all the shits that Bitfinex did during the years(market manipulation, inside trading and so on).
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:21:40

The complaints must come from Europe and HK too.
Bitfinex is based in Italy.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:26:17
there is NO ongoing investigation from Hong Kong police. Bitfinex lied.
How do you know that 119K BTC lost was equal to 36% of total deposits?
What's the Bitfinex's BTC address from where the funds were stolen?
Bitfinex keeps this things as being "secrets". Why? :)
We are talking about 70 MIL USD hack and Bitfinex wants to earn over 20 MIL USD(36%) from this. More than that, to run the biz as usual. :)
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:06:31
one of the Bitfinex's owners is from Italy :)
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:07:22
Bitfinex is earning time now. They are transferring the money from their bank accounts, they move the BTC and they are talking with you...why? because they don't want the people to make complaints with police, etc...
As long they are in contact with you, many of clients will feel in "safe"...somehow...
Normally, this is what any Bitfinex's client should do; to file a complaint against Bitfinex and Bitgo.
Don't be fooled by "Zane Tackett"(if this is his real name) &amp; Co. You won't see any money back or you will see peanuts.
They are not novice and they know how to scam :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:18:22
you are right. Bitfinex did an illegal thing as many other exchangers. 
Kraken, Poloniex, BTC-e is doing the same. They will be next.

Bitfinex is a PURE scam. There was no hack. They will get over 20 millions from their customers and they continue the business like nothing happened.
Their clients must be idiots to leave the things like that.
Bitfinex said that they already contacted law enforcements. What law enforcement? :)
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:43:55
their clients should be really, but really stupids to not file lawsuits against Bitfinex after they withdraw 64%. 
That means someone will take a look over all the shits that Bitfinex did during the years.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:34:48
too bad that there are not many persons like you here.
most of them are blind people. they don't investigate and they take everything as they are served :)

@_date: 2016-08-08 13:16:49

@_date: 2016-08-08 08:27:00
great point ! they accepted - 36% LOL
One with one million will take less than 700,000 USD. You must be very, very idiot to accept that till the end. Yes, withdrawn the funds that they offer you and then sue their asses for the rest of the money.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:59:23
 Bitfinex has partnered with BitGo  a  YEAR ago (June 04, 2015) !  CFTC warned against Bitfinex a MONTH ago and their investigation has started in Oct. 2015 so long time AFTER Bitfinex has partnered with BitGo.
So, Bitfinex changed their "security" process BEFORE  CFTC started the investigation against them.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:27:51
then, we should take as word of GOD all Bitfinex is saying. 
if they say "it was a hack", we should believe them even they didn't provide any single evidence for that.
if they say "36% cut", we should agree that this is the correct number, right? :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:23:44

@_date: 2016-08-07 21:28:25
Bitfinex made claims without any "facts"/proofs so... if you are Bitfinex client, hire a lawyer and get your funds back(without any dumbass tax) as soon as possible. Bitfinex has money in their bank accounts.
if you are not, then make searches, but the things together and you will see the whole image(maybe).

@_date: 2016-08-09 10:06:12

@_date: 2016-08-08 23:10:41
very good point but you will find almost no supporters here.
once Bitfinex is under investigation and their records are open, many illegalities(like market manipulation, inside trading, money laundering and so on) will be discovered. :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:16:04
FBI? What does have FBI with Bitfinex? Bitfines jurisdiction is Hong Kong.
FBI will redirect you to the local authorities. :)  What a lie ! 
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:55:11
great point! indeed this is the truth.
of course, there are some angry people who lost a lot of money(those with millions) and I am sure that they won't solve the issue on the legal way but in...other way :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:36:27
they will buy it when it's around of 0.1 or something. nice "deal", right? 
you steal 27 mil USD after you cut 36% from your customers funds and then you recover the shit tokens that you issued for almost nothing. in short, Bitfinex will make around of 30 mil USD within few weeks. Not bad at all. :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:14:24
Wrong.  CFTC issued an order filing and simultaneously settling charges against Bitfinex for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and for failing to register as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM).
So, they are not regulated by anyone. They are an illegal company. :)
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:59:44
i don't need documents to see the reality. MtGox did the same and more, they manipulated the price with their fake transactions at over 1200 USD
all the chinesse exchangers have fake volumes, Bitstamp the same.
Bitfinex is well known for inside trading, fake volumes, price manipulations and so on.
How can they be  exchanger when the most of their clients withdrew their remaining funds?
Did Bitfinex present any hack evidence? Any audit, any order book? you (as a sheep) believed their words. then, do the same in my case, kid.
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:50:14
the same evidence that Bitfinex offered,"words" . 
aren't they enough? :)
 Bitfinex didn't even offer the BTC account from where the funds were stolen.
Bitstamp did that from the first hours when they were hacked...
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:24:06
because Bitfinex doesn't have any financial license for their illegal business. also, CFTC just put them to pay a fine for that : 
Of course, Bitfinex needs licenses from Europe, Hong Kong, etc....too but...it seems that they don't care about regulations, insurances, clients and so on
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:17:35
the vocal people are those from Whaleclub. they know the crooks from Bitfinex and that's why they are posting a lot of non senses in order to cover the shit, this HUGE scam.
Where is the external audit? Where is the name of the law enforcement name who is investigating the case?
Bitfinex issued illegal securities(tokens) by breaking all the financial laws. They stole 35% from ALL their clients.
This is the truth !
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:37:04
behind closed doors the owners are counting the money(cash/make it rain) from the bank accounts and they are agreeing who to split them and where they can go after that in order to live a luxury life :)
WTF cares about clients? they made tens of millions and they will run with tens of millions.
yes, maybe they will give back peaneats so that they can buy valuable time...but that's all :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:26:34
the alternative doesn't exist for Bitfinex gang and other similar exchangers.
yes, whatever bitfinex would do, people would still be angry because there is no hack. is it? okay. any proof? none. only words.
facts: Bitfinex runs an illegal/scam business without any license, this fact was certified by CFTC.
the alternative is "to be honest", to run a legal business with all the proper licenses.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:53:12
Most of those who contribute are feeling compassion for Bitfinex. They are like consoling them with a nice touch on their heads  LOL
Wake up, people ! The owners made millions of USD profit by doing inside trading, market manipulation, so called "hacks" for which they didn't provide any proof. They said that they cannot name any law enforcement. MORE, Potter said " I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVOLVED!" haha.....
Why not, should be the next question. Nobody asked about that.... . What a joke !I mean, it's a robbery. Any legal company would say: "we alerted X or Y  law enforcement". It is NOT a secret.
How can you feel compassion for them? It's like you keen a HYIP(ponzi) :)
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:28:22
why do you put such smart questions? be a sheep like many others or a shill. :) 
it doesn't matter that Ledger Labs has NO relation with an accounting company/auditor because many idiots will believed that.
of course that Bitfinex won't appoint a real auditor because all their frauds made during the years....will be revealed.
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:35:27
great point ! of course, it's an inside job. a well planned one.
Phil Potter is one of the shit Bitfinex's owners  who admitted that he is doing inside trades. He earned millions from that. Bitfinex owners can see the other orders from their orderbook and it's so easy to manipulate the market. :)
As you can see, there are so many stupids who are still using Bitfinex.
Bitfinex owners came from the HYIP world and they know how to manipulate people :) 
Is it not strange how can omeone  send money to a shady, illegal company with a bank account in Taiwan, with no real office, only to trade....BTC? it's an up side down world.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:37:57
there is no ongoing investigation in Hong Kong yet.
Bitfinex did not announce any law enforcement. The reason is well known. They run an ILLEGAL forex/broker. 
They have no license, no insurance, no nothing.
Once you announce the police, they verify you in depth. Do you think Bitfinex wants that a law enforcement to check their order  books to see all the SHITS/SCAMS they made during the years?
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:44:20
LOL. yeah, right! Then it will be NO Bitfinex anymore.It will be a legal company :))
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:40:10
their friend. 
A start up software company is making a FINANCIAL audit. Another fraudulent thing. 
A financial auditior MUST be certificatied to do that. Not even an accountant can do that. The accountant must pass some exams in order to become auditor. WTF is Ledgershit? Bitfinex's friends ! :)
Let the lawsuits come ! 
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:37:27
this is what I am saying , 
"64% is better than 0% " is a "THANK YOU Bitfinex"
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:30:34
in order to be a forex/broker and money transmitter as Bitfinex is, they MUST have a financial license so they are illegal.
let's not forget that many exchangers are/were in jail because of running unlicensed money transmitter in USA(having clients from USA).
CFTC  will take action against Bitfinex again...this is not a problem. More than that, I think SEC will do the same.
Those who are still using Bitfinex are without brain. Bitfinex can be closed anytime(overnight).
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:09:41
CFTC is like SEC, a  civil enforcement authority while  FBI and police are criminal enforcements :)
Yes, CFTC  and SEC can order a fine but it's a civil one.

this is happening when you are using an UNlicensed financial exchanger. Do not use such exchangers ever. 
Even you are charged more with a licensed one, use it. You rather pay more than to have your money stolen by someone like Kraken or others. Don't believe that other exchangers are not doing the same. They do...
All the exchangers MUST have financial license. It doesn't matter the country. Almost all the countries have laws/regulations/licenses regarding to financial services.
they are illegals but they are saying they have "terms". WTF terms can you have when you are OUTLAW? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:24:43
it's a hipster who thought that it's a god. same with the others from Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:08:27


yes, FUCK the clients. move the money from their pockets to "your" pockets  :))
@_date: 2016-04-25 10:34:04
as long these exchangers are not regulated, they don't have a financial license, they can do whatever they want. 
that's why they like to be in shadow. they report to nobody, there is no audit...nothing.
 they can manipulate the market as they want and the clients/community is on "silence" mode. :)
Willy bot is in action.

CFTC Orders Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex to Pay $75,000 for Offering Illegal Off-Exchange Financed Retail Commodity Transactions and Failing to Register as a Futures Commission Merchant.
So, per definition, Bitfinex is a shit illegal company.
More than that, Bitfinex is not licensed as money transmitter, broker, forex in any country. Again this is ILLEGAL

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:03:15

"Even if the manufacturer ( claims that it runs open-source code, how do you tell whether it is actually running what you compiled?" Verbücheln said.
with other words: MANY developers worldwide are working in their free time to a project, in this case, Bitcoin. That's why it's called OPEN SOURCE.
These developers can put anything they want INTO  the code source: ".... that some pieces of open-source code are so large and complex that even a dedicated community of developers may not detect a malicious addition."
SO, your system can be clean BUT what your Bitcoin application can be "infected" even you download it from bitcoin.org
Advice : do not keep your funds into a system like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:25:56
they will use whatever is necessary.
i am thinking that Bitstamp could be an "inside" work and not a real hacker :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:57:30
most of the so called Bitcoin exchangers will close their business.
everybody is selling and the last ones will pay the bill :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:51:02
in short, Bitstamp lost around of 5 MIL as the rumor was from beginning.
Now, you can start with suppositions whether BitStamp will give any money or not. :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:44:55
rumors that the Bitcoin is like dead. the so called miners are already closing their "shops", people are selling, no new (fools) newcomers  :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:54:45
Bitcoin = scammers, drugs, hackers and few dreamers and speculators
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:45:44
it might be the end of BTC as you know it. FREE :)
I doubt that many people will still use Coinbase if they get any license. That means these people are hypocrites.
They say " we want de-centralized services, no documents" but they will still use a licensed exchanger who is FORCED by law to report you :)
My question is: why would someone still use BTC for trading when you have many normal brokers/forex where you can trade in the same conditions as you will trade with Coinbase (tones of papers and transactions reported) :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:32:05
correct. now, we will see if they want to cover the loss.
they made a LOT of profit.
They have 2 choices:
1. keep the rest of the money (A LOT. i think they have over 10 MIL) and close the biz
2. cover the loss which is not small at all.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:00:57
coinbase is operating illegally at this time. they do not have any MSB license. 
also, it is not the first one with license. Bitpay has license in Georgia.
License = a lot of papers. Their clients are from the BTC community. BTC want anonymity and not centralized services.
Coinbase licensed= you will be 100% reported to IRS, FINCEN and others. 
Let's not forget how many US exchanges are closed and the owners in jail for Unlicensed Money Transmitter.
Example: MT Gox had their very first problem when 2 MIL was seized because they had a branch in USA and they operated without license.
Bitstamp's owner is in jail for 2 years for Unlicensed Money Transmitter. There are many other cases...
Yes, Coinbase has a lot of money but they are/WERE outlaw.
In short: Coinbase is operating without financial license since 3 years ago !
Conclusion: they can be closed and jail time for owners anytime....even they will take licenses tomorrow.
Yes, these are facts not bullshits. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:20:36
it is not new the exchangers arrogance. they pose like being Trump or other billionaire when they are so kids who will be beind bars soon.
they are operating without any license. they are not MSB so they are outlaw.
Bitinstant's owner is in jail for that. What's the difference between Bitinstant and Coinbase? None. :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:43:05
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:10:16
I think they may be banned in USA. Meaning that all the payments coming from Bitstamp are rejected.
see: Commonwealth Bank is said to have blacklisted Bitstamp
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:21:00
Bitstamp in the today news : 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:46:48
Even so, Bitstamp MUST have these money in bank, right? I think most of these money came from bank deposits.
So, Bistamp "lost" 5 MIL worth of BTC but they have USD/EUR in bank. They are full covered.
Their clients must ask the money back asap. Anyway, their bank will froze their account shortly.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:36:38
the 10 MIL stockpile doesn't belong to Bitstamp.
This is the client's money. :)
BitStamp is compromised even they cover the loss.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:28:11
Bitcoin is DEAD !
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:09:31
payza = egopay
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:18:48
it came up this information :
Bitstamp lost 18K BTC. 
That means aprox. 4.7 MIL USD
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:57:52
yeap. 5 MIL lost. I have doubts that BitStamp will cover it.
They said that "actively engage with law enforcement officials"
That means a police investigation = bank account frozen(at least for now).
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:44:05
yes, I am sure that will these terrorist attacks a Bitlicense is missing when there are laws for that in USA
The MSB law.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:18:36

The lastest statement from CEO Nejc Kodrič :
[i]"Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their bitcoins held with us as prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9am UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full.
On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC.  Upon learning of the breach, we immediately notified all customers that they should no longer make deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses.  As an additional security measure, we suspended our systems while we fully investigate the incident and actively engage with law enforcement officials.
This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.
We appreciate customers’ patience during this disruption of services. We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days. Customers can stay informed via updates on our website, on Twitter ( and through Bitstamp customer support at support

In August 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new rules regarding insider trading (made effective in October of the same year). 
Under Rule 10b5-1, the SEC defines insider trading as any securities transaction made when the person behind the trade is aware of nonpublic material information, and is hence violating his or her dutyto maintain confidentiality of such knowledge. 
 A person is liable of insider trading when he or she has acted on privileged knowledge in the attempt to make a profit.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:47:47
The question remains : What's the difference between Bitinstant and Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:55:29
these exchangers are manipulating the Bitcoin market. of course they have inside information but because nobody cares about that, they can do whatever they want with your funds.
They are like a gang. Bitstamp has processed almost all the big exchangers orders until 2-3 months ago.
Make a search and you will find their connections.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:47:54
"Because most of these exchangers are ran by amateurs, hipters who think about their self that they are GODS.
That's why these things are happening. Look to their behavior. They think that they are a corporation; same as Mtgox or Moolah did it.
They dream to be millionaires overnight and they are because of ...their clients who do not make their due diligence.
 They have conferences where they explain how a biz must be done...and a lot of bla bla... 
Look here :    
This is a common behavior for almost all these "exchangers". They are "busy" people, full of the word's problems.Nobody can understand what  burden they carry but in essence they are some kids who saw a lot of money in their hands. 
They are full of vanity....they know better than anyone how the "things" are in the financial industry even they have 25 years old. 
They develop so called "scripts" on  knees and saying "it's the best, the safest"  even they only tested them for 1-2 weeks.
A real software it's tested for months and even so you cannot declare it as safe.
That's why all the hacks are happening. The greed and vanity will bring down all these so called exchangers.
Unfortunately, their clients will pay the bill."

it is not the FIRST. Bitpay has license in Georgia :)
it's not a such big deal what they are doing. I am just curious what fees they will have after that. The compliance is terrible and it's eating a lot of money. :)

if they don't like authorities, why do they sue the exchanger? 
Sue= asking the authorities to do justice  :)
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:24:56
all the exchangers have FAKE volumes. that's why :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:26:38
 A court = authorities
do you want a non reversing transactions or do you want a contract?
this error is normal and it must be adjusted. if the bank will credit your account with any amount by mistake, they will take it back; same here.
again, do you want a free trade(that means NO  court, no law OR regulated trading which means law) ? :)
that mistake(transaction) is not part of any contract. the funds doesn't belong to the client.

very true ! why do you say it's a fake news or sad? he says the facts and you have to admit it:
"There are speculators and traders who make markets in things like Bitcoins.  They don't care about the underlying value of anything. 
 All they care about is the value right now, and the momentum of the pricing.  If something looks like it is going up they buy it, simply on the hope they can sell it for more than they paid and take a profit on the trade.  
They don't see the things they trade as having stored value, because they intend to spin the transaction very quickly in order to make a fast buck.  Even if value falls they sell, taking a loss.  
That's why they are speculators.
Unless you are a professional trader, or you simply want to gamble, stay away from Bitcoins"

@_date: 2017-10-04 19:53:30
Bitfinex is a fraudulent company and they are pumping fake USDT to BTC. They are making a very bad thing. It's a crime, in fact. 
I don't see that someone is so reluctant to them but you are toward to a man who did you....nothing :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:40:35
BTC market seems to be a chain of fools and idiots.  LOL
I am wondering how can you come with these ideas. 
WOW !  :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:22:31
Bitfinex is a FRAUD.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:46:38

@_date: 2017-09-15 14:50:26
Huobi and OKcoin  will close their shit biz:)
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:14:27
yes, very true !
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:39:58
add this to the many other shits that Bitfinex did during the time and you will get the whole image about who is behind the so called "free BTC market" :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:22:31
Bitfinex is a FRAUD.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:37:31
i can trade like that on any real forex company.
try ! :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:16:36
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:56:37
digits on a screen and only the kids can believe that BTC market cap = cash  :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:02:55
another stupid.  LOL
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:58:28
trust Bitfinex and Wex.nz   LOL
all the BTC is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:22:18
as you have an opinion, others may have to. 
learn to to respect that  :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:10:59
a shit unregulated exchanger is talking about "plans of China"  LOL
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:00:58
right. it doesn;t exist.  monopoly tokens
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:06:50
hodl, hold, moon, buy, BTC is gold.  these words belongs to a HYIP, ponzi... 
 are you brainwashed? LOL
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:55:11
this is how they are making money the shits from Bitfinex.
someone must be really idiot to use their website.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:52:56
Bitfinex was a fraud since they started. a gang of shits
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:55:05
only based on speculation = bubble
China is dead, Bitfinex is dead (no currency deposits since 8 months ago), many exchangers have the same problem but ...somehow, BTC is going up . it's really odd :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:29:33
this is a great news!
the shit must be removed. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 00:25:55
there many people who earned from this :)
it's the same shit as with BTC. opportunists are earning. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:16:22
@_date: 2016-10-02 00:19:10
who is charging the big BTC exchangers who are doing the same? fake volumes and market manipulation? :)
all of them are doing that
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:01:34
BitMEX = unlicensed financial company = a shit like many other exchangers  :))
@_date: 2016-10-11 23:28:06
Bitfinex continues to be unlicensed... so, ILLEGAL
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:46:59
how can it rise when many exchangers do not accept bank wires and they cannot send wires? :)
the bots are on work :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:35:43
you gave your details to a gang LOL. 
you should provide your IDs only to licensed exchangers.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:38:50
same with a friend of mine.a withdrawal made 3 days ago and...nothing...
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:36:35
it's just a bubble and price manipulation as usual. no real money :)
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:38:28
it will be down shortly.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:25:25
everybody is free to do whatever he wants. :)
you have your interests, other theirs 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:29:57
FINCEN registration means nothing. they must be MSB. where are they registered as MSB?  LOL
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:26:18
because it's a shit not bullish. :)   
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:32:53
it is not a new industry. 
virtual e-currencies are since 20 years ago and they are regulated. 
BTC-e was a shit, who did a lot of shits. of course, there are many others like them. all will be closed.
there will be no BTC without regulation for exchangers.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:32:56
i may say that you are a shill too...
the people can express their opinions and you have to accept them as others accept yours. it's called freedom. did you live in N. Korea for a long time or what? :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:03:51
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:57:10
it's all about money. "you" do not count :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:59
they are coming in your dreams..
Amazing how many kids are around...
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:29:20
you won't . don't use shady exchangers next time. use a licensed one :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:25:42
the exchangers MUST be regulated by having a financial license.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:11:06
almost all the ICO are scams. it's a new trend. "let's offer virtual tokens to idiots" .
HYIPs were the past, ICO is the present :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:16:40
full of kids here...
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:08:48
hard fork is 100% in either way.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:55:46
fired means the devs have an employer who is paying them. who is he? :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:34:41
Willy bot is used by all the exchangers ! :)
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:58:33
who cares about that? money talks :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:17:13
the exchangers will be regulated. that means financial license as it is NORMAL.
it's for the client benefit to use licensed exchangers. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:19:24
and he is working for...whom? how did he pay the bills, whores and cars? :))
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:38:12
a normal decision 
@_date: 2017-07-07 11:07:15
so, there is company who pay these developers and the developers are doing what the company is saying :)  it's something normal.
the company as any other normal business, have an interest...to make MONEY :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:06
you are brainwashed or a real stupid :)
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:33:30
a split will be GREAT. a lot of money for many people :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:53:16
Yes, Bitcoin is = black market around of 80-90%, (including drug dealers, hackers, etc), few dreamers and speculators and YOU, an idiot :))
is this something new?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:57:12
you are drunk or high for sure :))
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:13:21
PAID contributors:) 
all the have interests and the money are the primary goal.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:19:52
who cares? BTC needs instant transactions so that it can compete. 
otherwise is just a bubble pumped by shills, BTC media which is own by DGC (who owns many other exchangers) :)
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:17:54
who cares about that? we all care about cash :)
hard fork will bring a lot of speculation, the price will go up and down. so, this may bring you extra money :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:02:39


you are brainwashed  LOL
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:54:35
keep using shit exchangers(without a financial license) and you will lose your funds in the end.
avoid all the exchangers without financial license !
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:50:04
hard fork is about to come. it will be nice. more money, much more speculation and so on  :)
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:40:49
hard fork is expected ! :)
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:18:46
nobody pays with BTC    :))
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:18:14
kamikaze! many brainwashed people  :))
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:56:34
hahaha. you must be very stupid to believe these things. BTC-e won't refund anything. :)))
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:20:09
"take advantage of anonymity" ...yeah I don't want the gov to know that i eat eggs and broccoli :))
pfff. many kids around.
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:19:12
another e-currency will appear in few years and many of you will forget about BTC
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:55:43
BTC-e shit is down. hahahah
That means to use exchangers without a proper financial license. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:48:02
BTC is already controlled it. the big exchangers, BTC media and miners have the shame shareholders :)
so, dont' come with this shit about "controlling" when the control is already owned. :)
look how the exchangers are manipulating the market with their Willy bot.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:20:21
because the programmers are stupids and they don't know how to do it to be safe :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:03:21
Uber operated in BA only :)
Uber is illegal in Argentina as Xapo is too. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:54:53
who is "here" just for fun? :) everybody wants cash
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:06:44
money talks for ALL. don't pretend that you care about "concept" and not about money. the rest of your words are shit :)  I don't care what you think about me.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:07:29
ICO = the new HYIPs (a new version). It's a pure scam.  :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:15:36
a competition should be fair. the taxis are paying alot of money on licenses, insurances, taxes etc and the Uber and its drivers not. 
where is the fair competition here? :)
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:49:42
all the exchangers are manipulating. see the chinesses...
they have traading bots and they pump and dump the price. :)
you must be stupid or brainwash to think that someone is buying so much BTC or selling so much BTC.
use a real forex company like : 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:23:07
first, get a decentralized mind :)
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:17:29
please show me the link  where is saying that 
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:08:34
yes, this is the way. it's very simple and efficient. 100% you will get the funds back. 
Coinbase is a financial licensed exchanger, a real MSB in almost all the US so...you will get the funds back. No worries  :)
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:47:26
Bitcoin mining is banned in Venezuela so it's lie when someone says "Bitcoin mining is huge in Venezuela".  :)
It's only propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:23:47
all the big miners and big exchangers have the same investors. don't be a kid to believe that BTC is not centralized :)
you are just a puppet in their hands. try to speculate as much as you can and then live your life out of this shit, called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:29:54
fork is GOOD.  :)
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:46:51
don't use it if you don't like it :)
full of kids here !
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:26:31
it is the same with ALL the exchangers. You are buying from THEM  :)
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:17:04
Poloniex is an unlicensed MSB so....you should go to FBI not in court. :)
They have no financial license in US so...
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:50:50
bots at work :)
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:15:23
hard fork is more than welcome :)
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:35:55
he is working for...whom? :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:27:45
who cares? don't like it? do not use it ! :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:22:02
hard fork is coming... :)
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:53:44
Bitfinex doesn't have any real office. HK is just where their company is registered. I am wondering how the price is going up while Bitfinex have their bank accounts frozen, the chinesses exchange have strong AML, BTC-e lost their bank accounts too... :)
it seams that the big exchangers are manipulating the market as usual :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:42:34
Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in every business in the cryptocurrency space.  :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:52:53
who are the...leaders? let's name them and let's see their interests :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:25:22
hard fork will come ! 
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:51:38
because there is a cartel who doesn't want to lose the control :)
they are saying a lot of shits for kids and brainwash people...
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:52:53
hard fork is coming :)
an alt coin will be created.  
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:20:53
this is happening when people are using UNLICENSED exchangers.
Kraken is vocal in media but it doesn't mean they are legal. No way! They have no financial license in USA not EU.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:06:06
XAPO is a fraudulent company. They are "based" in USA but they have no financial license(no MSB). 
That's why they can "afford" to treat you like a shit. You cannot do anything. Withdrawn your funds from them asap
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:15:31
both of them are illegal in Argentina.
Uber/its drivers do not have transport license and it was banned by Argentina's gov and Xapo doesn't have any financial license anywhere :)
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:55:16
the hard fork is unavoidable
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:23:41
being registered with FINCEN means nothing. you can register yourself with FINCEN but you are NOT an MSB.
Poloniex must be registered in each state if they want to do biz as exchanger. They are not even registered as MSB in Delaware... :)
Poloniex, Kraken and others are doing the same illegal thing. They are unlicensed money transmitters. It's scary that the people are using them without looking to this thing. :)
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:31:35
most of the miners are doing the same or the bribed the directors of electricity companies :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:25:00
stop using an e-currency like BTC if you are not prepared to lose OR use financial licensed exchangers.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:21:39
meaning hardfork, shill :)
