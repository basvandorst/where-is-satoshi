There are tons of people who are bullish. Know what they have in common? They all hold BTC.  It's in their best interest to pump.
Very rare to meet someone who is bullish and don't own any BTC.

I take it back. the price includes 1 BTC pre-loaded. So it's not as expensive as I thought.

what makes zero sense are your comments.
"No Money? You have *no money* and you are knowledgable about bitcoin? I seriously doubt it."
Since when does being knowledgeable about bitcoin equate to having money???
 " "Bullish on BTC but prefer other assets". So you don't diversify into assets you are bullish on? "
One can be bullish on many assets but it doesn't mean they have to invest in everything.  Unless you're the 1%, you diversify into assets you are most comfortable and bullish on.

Can't stomach the risk
No money
Prefers other assets.
Why do I have to explain this?

Can't agree more. You give up your privacy when you use banks. I moved to another country for work not long ago and the bank in the country where I was from said I can't own an account if I'm not in the country. So I requested to transfer my funds to my new bank. 
To do so I had to submit a bunch of forms to prove my identity, source of income, reason for transferring. To top it off, all was done by snail mail and they charged me $40. 
I was with this bank for more than 15 years and yet they treated me like a suspicious criminal. 
Then I had to go through the same process with my new bank in order to receive my OWN money.
They needed to know where the money was coming from and requested 3 months of bank statements to prove source of income. 
I sent them 3 redacted versions just showing only the information they needed but they wanted to see the whole statement. I told them to duck off. They finally gave in.  
I really hate banks for for their fees, outdated processes, lack of empathy towards customers.

Totally agree. Think we'll see 7.2-7.5k before going higher. Have my buy order at that level.
