This FUD is laughable when you consider CME/nasdaq are obviously seeing dollar signs. You think they aren't regulating this? Nah, they'll just jump straight into the most volatile market in history without a battle plan right?

One obvious technological winner? You're talking about Litecoin yeah? Or ETH? What about NEO?  
If BTC is crappy enough to get overthrown that makes Bcash crappy enough to not be the overthrower.

Dark times ahead. S2X fork (estimated middle of nov) might create enough confusion and market doubt to make big changes.

Your acting like no one with any significant power would ever short Bitcoin? So many people stand to gain off of a BTC crash.

There's some shenanigans you can pull off by moving everything to gdax for free but I'm not sure if you can get around the transfer fee.

That doesn't mean r/bitcoin should support every random scamcoin. I think most reasonable people here see the advantages of something like ETH that has real technical capabilities.

THE GDAX RED CANDLE IS INSANE.

You can most definitely outlaw math. The U.S. gov makes cryptocurrency trading illegal. ISPs are forced to report all blockchain activity. The price plummets. The banks hire all the blockchain programmers and centralize everything making it taxable and trackable. We all start trading JPmorgancoin.  
As someone who's hodling, that's worst case scenario and not very probable. But it's possible.

There is no single thing. More people are learning about it and investing. Banks are wising up. Hedge funds are using it. Famous investors are praising it.
