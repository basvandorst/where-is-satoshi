aaannd its gone. Bitcoin has failed mainstream acceptance. Who in their right mind would invest into something that can suddenly dissapear and go offline? 
 Bitcoin - A few people got rich but the majority lose.

I don't blame them, bitcoin is  used to purchase illicit drugs and is illegal in several countries.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:03:15
Bitcoin is illegal and immoral. People are sitting on a pile of digital coins and luring newbies into the scam funnel. They buy in with the hope bitcoin will increase in value.... sound familiar? Here I will give a hint, it starts with P and rhyme with Ponzi.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:59:31
Biggest scam in history.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:17:24
If the winkelvoss twins are smart they will sell their coins while they still can. bitcoin is going nowhere, it has been banned by Apple and since every company copies Apple others will ban bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:28:02
Finally, more and more people in r/bitcoin are realising the truth. Bitcoin is broken and can never go mainstream. It is illegal, it is slow, it is insecure, and it is immoral. 
Great post and you can bet your bottom dollar the bottom of this scam will fall out soom. People in the future will read about how bitcoin was the biggest scam in the 21st century. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:50:56
Its about time the goverment banned bitcoin. After all, bitcoins main use is for purhasing illegal drugs.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:51:24
The lesson here is that bitcoin is NOT secure. Look how easily this poor chap was scammed out of his bitcoins. And he was a computer literate! How do you expect non techies to adopt bitcoin, or 95% of the free world?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:45:08
Yes they can and they will. Do you really think the Fed is going to let anything threaten their bread and butter? No doubt bitcoin is currently in their crosshairs, and they WILL pull the trigger. The Fed is the hunter and bitcoin is the deer.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:54:02
What's the point? Bitcoin has filed for bankruptcy, and your imaginary coins are worthless.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:27:23
Mt.Gox wont survive and it is foreshadowing the fate of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:53:39
bitcoin is dead. it has lost steam. game over.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:58:01
Yes it does, they could orchestrate a 51% attack and mess up the network.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:15:18
Because it has no place in the real world. The only advocates of bitcoin are those who already have stockpiles of coins. Lets be honest, the only reason you want to see bitcoin succeed is so you can benefit directly from it. Ask yourself, how many supporters of bitcoin are there that don't own any coins themselves?  
Truth be told, bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. People with coins are trying to get others to buy into bitcoin with the promise of growth in the future. Even here on reddit there are advertisements telling people to [join bitcoin]( 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:28:48
You just threw away your future. Later this year when bitcoin is worth less than dust you will stare at a blank wall and wonder what you were thinking.
Do the right thing, get on your knees and beg for your old job back.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:03:55
me too, but this time it is banned by apple. RIP bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:51:36
While you're at it, why not ask if they will accept pieces of string or buttons.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:37:23
every tech company nowadays copies apple. they are industry leaders and they baned bitcoin, others will follow suit.
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:25:04
Bitcoin is one big scam. A decentralized currency can never work, it is backed by nothing. Fiat currency works because it is backed by the government and that provides trust and stability.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:03:01
Wishful thinking. bitcoin can't survive long, it's the very nature of a Ponzi scheme. Eventually people realize it's worth nothing, and backed by nothing, and the scam collapses. A few people got rich, but the majority were taken to the cleaners.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:42:34
Technically it does. Bitcoin's main use is the purchase illegal drugs and to launder money.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:01:51
Now people can order food and it takes 2 whole minutes for the transaction to confirm. By the time the payment has cleared their food is cold and soggy. Thanks bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:31:05


Until your house burns down, then you are SOL. You will be on the street broke and pennyless begging for a nickel.
The irony is if you had used fiat currency instead, you would be insured and protected. Bitcoin has zero protection.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:16:20
Apple is the leader in the technology sector. They banned bitcoin... what does this tell us? Bitcoin has no place in the tech sector. And if for some reason Apple decides to incorporate cryptocurrency, why would they use bitcoin when they can just as easily make their own "Applecoin".
Apple has far more reach, marketing avenues, and deeper pockets than bitcoin. If they decide to make  Applecoin it will be the end of bitcoin overnight.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:44:52
They posted his home address which is questionable. It will probably attract thieves to break into his home steal his bitcoins.
This is a big reason why bitcoin is a very bad idea. It is very easy to steal. And if your coins are stolen you are SOL.
Fiat currency and credit cards are much safer. If a thieve steals your wallet and maxed out your debit/credit cards you are fully protected.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:32:23
And the biggest idiots are the people paying $500+ per bitcoin. There is no patent nor anything proprietary that is protecting bitcoin. Yet people are shelling out hundreds of dollars... for imaginary coins? **I smell a scam**.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:48:10
So the bitcoin community is essentially blackmailing Apple? This is unethical and illegal. I won't be surprised if Apple wages war on bitcoin, and if they do, you can kiss your precious bitcoin goodbye.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:41:34
Mass adoption will never happen, at least not with bitcoin. How can people trust bitcoin when every exchange/wallet either steals them or eventually gets hacked and stolen? Since bitcoin is decentralized there is no one to govern/regulate it, and theives and hackers are flocking to it.
The only safe way to keep a bitcoin is a paper wallet completely offline locked in a safe. But that defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin, isn't it supposed to be a currency? Why not just buy and store gold instead? Ask anybody on the street if they would rather buy and store gold or bitcoin, 100% will say gold.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:26:07
Exactly, and this is no doubt one of the many nails in bitcoin coffins. Try explaining bitcoin to a regular Joe haha! It can't be done. There is Youtube videos explaining bitcoin and they is complicated as hell.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:30:26
This argument is lame. Bitcoin is illegal and should be banned.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:35:56
It is. There is zero chance of bitcoin reaching $10k. People got that number from extrapolating graphs, but that is not how markets work. If they did then every Forex trader would be wildly successful.
Like it or not, last November is the highest the price is ever going to be. How do I know? Have a look at Google Trends. Bitcoins has already trended (last November) and is slowly losing search volume.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:13:59
Bitcoin is illegal and used to evade taxes. You can bet your bottom dollar uncle Sam will collect and when he does you will wish you never downloaded a single bitcoin. He will thrown you in jail for money laundering and tax evasion.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:09:44
Oh please, you don't give a rats ass about satashi, you only care about your bitcoins being worth money. When bitcoin goes bust and your pennyless on the street, will you still thank satashi?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:52:31
And bitcoin is the biggest Ponzi scheme of them all. Psst, it's worth nothing, but let's convince people to buy it! The perfect scam.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:51:22


It's him. Did you even read the newsweek article? He said "I am not involved in bitcoin anymore". Then later the associated press interview he completely changes his story claiming not ever being involved with bitcoin? Then mysteriously his p2pfoundation forum account posts "I am not Dorian" after being stagnant for years?
He is obviously playing dumb and trying to lose the heat from the media.
Also, the email comparison argument floating around means nothing. People write differently in different situations. In one email he is casually writing about his hobby trains. In the other email he is seriously writing and announcing something he has been working on for likely years.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:03:20
The funny thing is the magic beans are more legit than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:59:34
Because it IS a scam. Let's look at the facts. Bitcoin is inherently worth nothing. **The only value it has comes from people promising it will be worth more in the future**. The early adopters stand to gain and everyone else loses.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:09:35
Why would anybody trust bitcoin at this point? Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:03:01
He isn't wrong, bitcoin IS a bubble and will eventually be worthless. It is just taking a longer than usual because people are stille pumping money into the scam. Bitcoin is like a digital version of Enron. People thought it was blue chip, but in reality its worth nothing.
