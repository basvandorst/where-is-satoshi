Yes, but I don't see that as a problem. Whatever works for a critical number of people. "Life finds a way".
Some know this as "necessity is the mother of invention", others conceptualize it as "mutation and contextual selection", still others see it as "locus of stability as an emergent property from the interaction of dynamic variables in a multidimensional dissipative system".
IMO Satoshi understood this from all of those points of view. He would have had to.

Yeah, since when does the "honey badger" need a lawyer?

Yes, this is the crux of the matter.
There are only a few core characteristics of the Bitcoin protocol, designed to work in synergy with human psychology (basic individual incentives), that gave rise to the phenomenon of bitcoins as money.
One of those characteristics - massively distributed proof-of-work - stopped working over 2 years ago with various instances of &gt; 50% centralized control of hashing power (actually, that should be more accurately specified as &gt; 25%).
If one agrees with this assessment, one must also reasonably conclude that all other secondary and tertiary core developments ("BIPs") would be put on the back burner and this primary existential threat to Bitcoin's perception of value addressed immediately and exclusively until the problem was solved and correctly implemented.
That has not been the case. BIPs implemented over the last 2 years seem to deal with incremental improvements such as simplifying multi-party key signing or making it easier for businesses to request payment.
Many people, initially drawn to and invested in bitcoins and the idea of Bitcoin based on these core characteristics, have asked "why"? It seems to me that the questions keep cropping up because their questions have been summarily dismissed or the answers have been unsatisfying.
At this juncture, I find the probability of an alt-coin taking over Bitcoin's value proposition, in spite of Bitcoin's current dominance in network effect, to be growing by the day. ZeroCash seems like a notable prospect.
One interesting thing to keep in mind about a groundswell of doubt and dissatisfaction with Bitcoin governance: unlike the quagmire experienced when shifting fiat to bitcoins, transferring value from bitcoins to an alt-coin is fast, easy, cheap, and can be done from anywhere in the world.
Sound familiar?

The drawbacks (loss of confidence in the monetary vehicle) have always been apocalyptic throughout recorded history. Always. There are thousands of examples of loss of confidence wrt faulty money over millennia, without a single exception. Beads, Cowry shells, unbacked inflated fiat (Weimar Marks / Zimbabwe Dollars), massively debased metal coinage, etc.
A monetary vehicle collapses when the masses lose confidence in its primary characteristics - the characteristics that promised fungibility, a reliable medium of exchange, and above all: a reliable store of value.
The mass's perception of Bitcoin as a store of value collapses when they realize that the system can be gamed. Your insistence that the major players must rationally adhere to some one-dimensional game theory is naive.
Bitcoin currently has a "market cap" of about USD $7B. This is equal to approximately 2-3 days of QE (money printing), and from just one jurisdiction (the USA). Bitcoin penetration is a threat to their eyes, but currently a bit player. It would be effortless for the Federal Reserve to co-opt the majority of mining power with untold riches of instant fiat money.
That is just one vector that can compromise the success of Bitcoin, but there are several others. The bottom line here is that they all depend on compromising the lynch-pin of Bitcoin: massively distributed proof-of-work.
This should be obvious.

That is correct. The rest of your reply is not. What's your point, and how does it address what I explained?

petertodd, pure gold. Haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Much respect dude.

Yep, he stabbed Satoshi in the back by going to the CIA cuz he thought that would be bragging rights. Satoshi disappeared right after that. Facts matter. Judge accordingly.

When there's no one left that remembers.

Wait, I just changed my mind... the best quote is: "Foundation: I don't understand. Satoshi: I know."
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:16:21
Yeah, that actually caught my eye more than the prediction of the Foundation's demise. Ideals spring from ideas, and ideas are indestructible.

Gavin has been on the board of the Foundation from the beginning. He sat through all the meetings and voted on all the issues. At any time he could have blown the whistle like Olivier did for the membership and the greater Bitcoin community. Why didn't he? 
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:33:40
Thanks! I'll check it out.
@_date: 2015-04-11 04:23:59
That was very wordy without actually addressing the points.
Are you saying the Foundation board acted with due regard to their fiduciary duty to the membership in particular, and ethically towards Bitcoin users in general?
You avoid the multitude of legitimate complaints. It seems like deliberate distraction/hand waving. This is variously termed "debating tactics" or "Sophistry".

Bitcoin and its blockchain are two sides of the same coin. One cannot exist without the other. Its blockchain's value lies in its security, but that security is bought by the incentives to miners embedded in the value of a Bitcoin - whether that comes from mostly block reward (now) or mostly fees (future). They are two aspects of one functioning system.

Flip through posts over the last 2 years:
and you find many instances where the Foundation's own members frequently charged the board and executive with lack of transparency, lack of focus, misallocation of resources, deep misalignment of individual/industry interests, and even predicting the current troubles - including proposals for splitting up the Foundation.
When these complaints weren't simply met with silence or dismissive hand waving, the Foundation seems to have routinely accused them of being trolls and malcontents, sometimes censoring members and deleting forum posts.
So now we see their own members were right.
The real belly laughs come when you recall that the Foundation's most over used byline is "Member-driven organization".
I can't see the point of putting time, effort and money into reanimating this corpse. For substantial and lasting change, you would have to get rid of the current cabal (Olivier excepted), completely rewrite the bylaws, etc. Might as well have a new group start fresh, modeled after existing and effective grass roots orgs.

No, follow the link. It was a fictional narrative by a Bitcoin Foundation member, apparently used as a literary tool to criticize the board and executive.

I read a lot of his posts in the last couple of days. I don't think it's magical. I just think he doesn't give a fuck about the usual things. Sometimes that affords clarity ;)
