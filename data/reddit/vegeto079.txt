No, I understand your point of view. I did in the first place. In this specific case you seemed to quickly discard the idea that they could have a different (legit) website besides businessname.com.
Reminds me of back in the day when I tried out Adventure Quest. Someone told me it was "battleon.com". My first thing is "wtf is it doing there? maybe this is a scam". But that doesn't stop me from checking it out, doing 1 second of Google research, and never caring about the URL again as the website is legit.
Perhaps if their website gains enough traction it will enable them to purchase snapcard.com from it's [current owners](
For now, though, searching "snapcard" shows their website as the first result, with "bitcoin" in the title, which is enough for me.

That is a very important matter to the average person, imo. It's a psychological barrier. I suffer from it myself. I plan on doing something similar as once I do get back my original investment I can stop worrying about the price so much because my original stake has been reversed.

Buyer beware: You have to use their included software (and have it running) just to play their games. It's not simple to use and I didn't like having another program needed to be ran just to play the darn game.
I had to use this site to purchase Hexic Deluxe for PC - I wanted to play it badly after playing it a while back on the 360. After looking a while and not finding a way to easily buy it (even torrent it) I eventually went through this site and bought it.

Ideally the saving part would all be under the hood of some software that downloads a selection of websites that you choose to opt into, then it just acts like a browser for the files. If you don't choose any given website it'll just ignore that section of the broadcast. Or depending on limitations, just grab it all.
I'd say it'd be a one time long download then browsable forever, and optionally updatable at any time you want the updated information.
This is just my take on the idea though.

OP asked for how to secure coins "easily", not 100% safe. Sure, NSA and elite uber hackers can steal our stuff, but they can also rob my house. These are things we hope won't happen, but might, and generally are out of our control (prevention-wise) without going full tinfoil hat.
His advice works perfectly fine - it fits OP's question of asking of an "easy" way to be more secure than just having btc on a market.
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:49:14
If this was honestly true, they would be using it to make millions of dollars, not post publicly, right?

@_date: 2016-05-20 19:45:54
Yeah of course, I didn't mean to underplay the situation. That money is the difference between sleeping on a broken bedframe and sunken bed to a nice new frame and bed, I haven't been able to pull together the money, so this helps a ton.
The whole situation is surreal, especially since I don't make 38btc in a year, that amount of money freaked me out when i saw it. Thought the receiving email was a phishing link.
@_date: 2016-05-21 04:57:21
No, I don't. I'm lucky to be living without having to pay very much rent right now. 
I've had some decent paying jobs for my entry level qualifications but several have fell through rather quickly, and in succession. My job right now pays well (well, more than I've made before) but it's part-time so I'm back to minimum-wage levels in the long run, and still paying my car just to get to work.
Current job says I might get fulltime after evaluation period, I'm really hoping on that, as I do like my current job.
Most of my current money just goes into paying bills, debt from the inbetween-jobs times and general living - I live a little better than I should food and entertainment wise based on my income, but not by a lot, I'd rather be in slight debt and happy than sitting around eating ramen. If this job pulls through I'd be debt free in about a year, no more than 2, so it's not too bad.
That's a big reason why it was difficult to send back the money and I felt the need to say something somewhere about it, it was kind-of eating at me. $17k would completely turn around my economic life right now, I'd be completely debt free and can stretch the worry-free for a good amount of time. But for a plethora of reasons I couldn't hold onto that type of money. Seeing how it could help my life makes me think about how it could wreck someone else's and put them far below what I'm dealing with economically, and that's just one reason.

@_date: 2017-07-30 09:05:22
You own a bitcoin like you own anything digital. Everything on a computer is math and stored numbers.
e: Someone want to post an argument instead of just downvoting?
As I see it, I own a bitcoin just as much as I own a game on Steam. I don't technically own anything, it's just a service that agrees that if I log into it, they'll let me play that game. Bitcoin is a service that agrees that if I "login" with the private key, I can send coins to another address. Just because you don't have the login password doesn't mean it wouldn't belong to you.
Neither case "technically owns" anything, but we can agree that it implies ownership, and in the case of the law, would probably be transferred to kin/spouse if it came to that situation where it was in question.

It'll hit zero at some point in the future, the question is when, and if it'll be during our lifetime.

I like how either side can read this and agree.

She technically owns them though, you don't have ownership of the blockchain.

If you could flip like that without flooding the market with your 100,000,000 Bitcoins, you deserve it!

It would've said it'll arrive instantly. If it didn't say that it's not going to. He could have purchased it just slightly before the instant thing started, so he's still waiting on payment verification.

But as for decent sums, especially if it goes up even more..
Ah well I might as well just get a cheap laptop and follow that other guide.

In the "customer is always right" atmosphere that markets have, I doubt it.
I remember reading about a new tech where you use your smartphone to scan the items in your basket as you shop, then when you're done you go to the checkout lane, they confirm that you got everything that you got, you pay and leave. No scanning at the register necessary. It was deemed too unfamiliar or something iirc, so didn't really happen, but if it did that could be implemented with bitcoin semi-easily.

Could you really blame them though? From the viewpoint of someone delivering pizza, a 5 dollar bill is much more usable (and therefore useful) than a paper wallet. The average Joe still doesn't have much a reason to pick $5 in BTC over $5 in USD. Perhaps if he would give more money via BTC than USD then it would be worth their hassle.

I used [this]( once in the past.

Why so expensive though? I was looking at around the $50-$200 range. I literally don't need to use it (minus storage) so would half-decent computing power even matter?

Yeah, damn those animated gifs, they've ruined everything! Back in my day the gifs were static and  everyone involved was well-behaved intelligent adults!

Not really plausible for a supermarket where you often decide what you want at the store.

I actually have an old shitty Android phone laying around, so I wouldn't mind using that. How would I go about that? I understand how I could do it (via other guides) using an offline PC, but is there a guide to having an offline Android wallet?
Or am I over-complicating it and you just mean via an Android wallet app?

As the guy who stocks bread, this is bologna. Rotation has one purpose: to sell the nearest-to-expiration items, while preventing the fresh items from being sold. Not that that's a bad thing - it only makes sense. We can't afford to throw out bread at the end of every day, that's a lot of shrink.
Once it's near expiration enough that we must mark it down or rid of it, we do just that.

Ah, I used to get .02btc/24hr around that time, was wondering if you got it recently since difficulty is way too high. Last time I tried mining it was so slow.

He purchased it to begin with, which (on a very small scale) helped bitcoin become what it is today.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:41:13
Actually kind of a good point, no way the person would know the difference. Wonder if there'd ever be a way around that.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:39:01
I recently used coinbase, and while I heavily recommend them, it wouldn't let me purchase under .1btc, which is around $50.
You have to consider bank fees too, I know they charged me like .15 for that and about a buck for a percentage rate based on how much btc I got. Still a very small amount, but something to consider if you're going to do a lot of small purchases.

I can't seem to turn off the tickers myself, even though I don't day trade at all, just in it for the long run..
Reading this (and the comments) made me realize I should probably temporarily block myself from at least the tickers. It's kind of taking up an unhealthy amount of my mind. And hell, I don't even have that much money in it.

Is there no way to put in a sell/buy order for specific prices? I imagine that's pretty important to the game, rather than having to go manually buy/sell all the time.

The pizza place had no knowledge for the transaction, one guy gave another guy 10k btc, then that other guy bought him two pizzas with a card.

So if I'm understanding this right:
Reformat phone&gt;get bitcoin app (via internet or perhaps just usb transfer an APK)&gt;transfer coins to phone&gt;leave phone off/airplane mode
Then if I want to transfer, I could just connect it online and transfer my btc like normal, then if I want to put some back on it, repeat the process?
Would this be as secure as an offline computer? Obviously anyone with the phone could access my coins but that's a given. But I suppose I could probably make backups just the same.

Because it's "bitcoln talk" instead of "bitcoin talk". Thankfully it was suspended, I didn't expect a thing clicking it..

It probably just uses Math.random or a similar pseudo-random number generator! We need true randomness.

I'm still hitting myself over buying pizza for [0.2662btc]( even though I know people have bought for more. At least you got a few pizzas too, I only had one!
I remember it costing more in btc even at the time than it would have in USD, but I did it out of convenience (and to try it out).
Especially when I just bought about that much btc for a nice hundred. Bah!!

Of course, likely it'll pop before I sell.
