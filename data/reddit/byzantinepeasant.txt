The "red zone" should be marked green: finally we're starting to develop a fee market! 
The "green zone" should be marked red: too much tragedy of the commons if the limit is that much higher than demand.

Every expert now agrees that Satoshi's "vision" was flawed.  Bitcoin can't scale.  We need to focus on digital gold and censorship resistance.  
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:41:35
Yes, this is where development should be focused.  Not coffees on the blockchain.

I've been around since 2010 noob.  Just lost my account and needed to make a new one.  k thx bye.

When Gavin explains something it is always in a very simple way, like he doesn't grasp the underlying complexity.  When Peter Todd explains something, it doesn't even make sense to me (e.g., treechains) so I think he is very smart.

Bitcoin is governed by the CODE.  It is not governed by the laws of economics.  Old paradigm thinking like supply and demand needs to end. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:28:12
The other speakers seem more knowledgeable about bitcoin too.  
Yeah, and what was with talking "command and control" regimes wtf?  The block size limit is not a production quota because it is enforced by the CODE.  The idea that it would lead to the things he talks about at the end (in an abrasive tone, I agree) are preposterous.

You're lying.  There has never been censorship and there has never been attacks.  Moderation of OFF-TOPIC content is NOT censorship.  Defending the network against rogue nodes and miners is NOT AN ATTACK.  You're purposely framing it in a sneaky way to make is SEEM like it's similar to the USSR or something stupid like that just to cause political drama and fragment the community.

These guys are experts who realize that Satoshi's vision has failed and the bitcoin can't scale.  
Name one expert who thinks bitcoin can be a payment network?  You can't because they've already come to consensus that bitcoin can only be digital gold.

Isn't bitcoin about leaving behind the flawed economics thinking that caused TBTF, the problems with fiat, etc?  Hearing this speaker talk about relying on supply and demand to create an equilibrium is the same flawed thinking all over again.  Bitcoin needs to be governed by the CODE and not by the randomness of supply and demand (if that concept even applies to bitcoin which I don't think it does).
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:45:47
Yeah, and he LIES and calls MODERATION "censorship" and and calls DEFENSE against rogue miners and nodes "attacks" (see his comment below).
This entire talk is a joke of psuedo-science (LIES) and polarizing rhetoric (more LIES) dressed up with fancy animations and pales in comparison to the other REAL RESEARCH presented at ScalingBitcoin.  The conference should NOT let him present in Hong Kong.

Right, bitcoin is digital gold.  Kill 2.0, kill coffees on the blockchain, kill 0-conf and everything else besides bitcoin's function: decentralized censorship resistant digital gold
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:29:16
That's because they do no more.  People who formally studied economics no less than nothing because of how wrong it is.  
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:49:28
Gavin was good for bitcoin at the beginning, but now it is time for him to move over and allow real experts like Peter Todd (and LukeJr and maaku7) to run the show.  These people understand what's critical:
1.  Bitcoin is not a payment network, it's digital gold
2.  0-conf is 100% unsecure (need RBF)
3.  Decentralization is more important than coffees on the blockchain
4.  Things like BitPay and tools to pay for things with bitcoin are bad.

You big blockers will try every trick in the book, won't you.  The block size is already to big and we can't risk more cetranlization.  
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:10:31
Why. Do you disagree with any of those for points?
