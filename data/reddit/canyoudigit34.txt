I meant for tax purposes.

the link to the transaction detail or my coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:57:30
so they are tax deductible and part of the cost basis?  
can we put them on schedule A as investment expense?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:04:32
thanks, I will give that a shot.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:19:35
is it possible that I entered the correct deposit address but it somehow didn't go through?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:12:32
do you know what does unspent means?
I only have two wallets and uses three exchanges....I checked all of them.....
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:27:05
if it's not one of my accounts....I most likely got hacked?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:38:56
it was not all at that time, but pretty much all......
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:53:49
I don't know if you 
but if you do, how do you enter the transfer fees?
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:20:11

@_date: 2017-12-16 03:40:56

it would be funny if Satoshi had sold off all his bitcoins at like $300.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:29:14
thanks, I do remember reading his thread.
however, his answer wasn't very clear on trading for altcoins.  He was saying exchanging for altcoins might or might not be like kind exchange.  So i'm not sure if there is an update on that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:37:00
you can hit her.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:51:09

@_date: 2017-12-17 03:13:55
I'm embarrassed to say....I'm a CPA. lol  an inexperienced one though.
I haven't seen any client with Bitcoin questions yet and IRS hasn't been very clear either. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:08:29
I have a foreign citizenship and address, but live in the US right now.  Not looking for tax evasion, just looking for higher profit.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:14:01
hello, do you have any idea on how to import that?  So by doing the import, there is no fee?  does it transfer all my altcoins as well?
Sorry, I don't think I'm advanced enough to understand the link you have.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:27:53
you are saying if I go to Ledger's setting and change the Fees to "Slow", it will be much cheaper?  Do you know how much cheaper it will be and how long does it take to confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:16:03
ok, thanks.
that is very annoying, since it seems like a lot of altcoins can't even be bought with USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:53:49
hi, i'm looking into this coinpot mining thing...can you explain what is coinpot facuets?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:06:51
sorry, I'm going against your advice and want to give my sister a small amount of bitcoins as a gift.  My question to you is how to do give them as gift?  paper wallet?  any recommendation?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:00

hi, can you send me tutorials you used?
I just ordered a Nano S, but I don't get what Segwit is still and how I can transfer from my exdous wallet to Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:20:20
why are so many people think it will cost a big correction though? there must be reasons behind their assumptions? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:26
I'm gonna get screwed....
I had limit order at $9,500 few days ago....

@_date: 2017-11-22 03:04:35
hmm....that's a good point
a lot of people seems to think the Thxgiving bitcoin discussions will boost the value though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:52:08
how much of a dip are you hoping? below $8,000?  7,5000? or 7,000?
