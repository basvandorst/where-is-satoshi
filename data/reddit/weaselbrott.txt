Looking into your comment history, there is a lot of angry/aggressive anal and ass references. I am sorry for whatever struggles you face in your life and hope you're able to overcome them, I really do. Therapy is a great resource.

Dude, its currently 14,390. Sounds like a discount!

Not a professional here,  but IMHO keynesian economists like Krug are at the core of fiat economics/psychology. Spend spend spend, inflate inflate inflate, HODL nothing so we can perpetuate the whole collective debt and rigged system. This guy is a bozo on a pedestal.

Crayon and Captain. I like your style.

pretty sure you can pay for someone to do that with some of your pocket change from that $1M BTC... I would take the BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:47:07
I just did the same now, a day after the dip I watched happen and was hesitant to buy in on... just HODL and it will all make up within time.

That guy on top, I'll bet he would like to know he was on the top of the mountain. Uuuuuuuge!

This will forever be my favorite meme
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:55:11
I caught this too. He has also spoken openly on [bitcoin here]( His good buddy Warren has a very different belief on Bitcoin. I believe that Bill Gates reading Blockchain Revolution has more to do with distributed ledgers in business systems and less to do with Bitcoin specifically.
