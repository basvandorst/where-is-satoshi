Best strategy is an methodical rake. For example, rake 5% out of BTC for every 25% gain in BTC price. Set up a spreadsheet to calculate your rake points when you INITIALLY invest, then stick to it no matter what happens. You'll end up taking some profits off the table so you can sleep at night, but will still own a big chunk of wealth in BTC if it shoots to the moon.

Your charitable giving, with no expectation of any type of benefit whatsoever – even a tax deduction – is inspiring. Thanks for all the donations and inspiring others.

Yeah, and consider this: if you opened a Coinbase account and then transferred $20K (worth of BTC) from your own wallet to Coinbase, then decided you were really interested in converting to USD transferred the BTC back to your own wallet, then Coinbase has to report all of your information to the IRS – even though you never converted from/to fiat. I consider that overreach, but they didn't ask me.

Oh good lord is that complicated. Just like your overly complex Proof of Logo tutorial. Good fan fiction though. Cheers mate.

My question is more about using a non-traditional (not FIFO) specification; in this case highest-price first-out. That means I have to track the lots myself. These are transactions across exchanges and on personal (not exchange) wallets. I believe for investor (not institutional) held stock certifications, for example, if one is trying to claim specific lots of certs then they have to track/sell that particular stock certification ID or something. I'm not sure how in the world that will apply to BTC.

When trading in/out of alts (to/from BTC) it is advantageous (at least in the case I'm looking at which has some older BTC acquire dates) to use a highest-price first-out lot selection technique versus FIFO. What type of paperwork do I need to keep to prove to IRS what lot selection is being used? I have everything documented in a spreadsheet, but I'm wondering if that would be enough. In particular, I haven't tried to isolate which BTC addresses I'm transferring in/out of on my personal wallet to match the taxing lots since that would be a *massive* pain and I consider BTC to be fungible. Is that predicted to be a problem?

You are thinking the gov't is further along the crackdown curve than they are. If Chinese government were to this point wouldn't they already be forcing all the miners to mine on the bcash chain? As it is now bcash / btc hash very clearly follows the predicted economic model:   The centralization of mining in China is definitely a concern, and hopefully with Japan entering the market will help improve that. If Chinese gov't were to start dictating which fork the miners are allowed to process on now then I think the only choice would be for a PoW change.

My prediction is the same, but I think the timeline for  6, and 7 will be very compressed. It will happen in just a day or two. Miners aren't going to mine the less profitable coin for very long at all. They are in it for the profit and have electrical bills to pay.

It was most likely bitcoin/2x related. Lopp isn't just an engineer working on bitcoin, he is an outspoken and vocal one.
