Oh, come on now. Don’t interject reason and reality into our outrage! /s

You can add your keys to something like the Blockchain iOS app.

Not relevant. It’s more like gold. At a basic level the intrinsic value of gold is the cost to dig it up and refine it to a usable level. (Assuming of course there is a market.)

A woke monster. The best kind!

The intrinsic value is the value of all the computing systems that make up the infrastructure needed to support it.

They’ll need verification but   does that.

Just give him the paper wallet.

I don’t know of any way to do that nor how viable it would be. Each conversion from fiat currency to crypto currency has its own fees. 
Probably more viable to simply accept crypto currencies as payment.

Blockchains depends on full nodes to function. If there is no economic benefit to running a full node, then why run one? It seems risky to only have miners running full nodes.

When you sell it, you pay taxes on the gains. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:41:25
Yeah, except the creation of anything of value takes energy. By definition. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:39:43
Only buy and hodl. So far no taxable gains.

ATMs are pretty pricey. Maybe 6% or so. Exchanges, in my experience, are lower. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:19:27
Thank you for your sacrifice.

If it’s a wallet, just create an account on an exchange (e.g. Coinbase or Gemini) and send the bitcoin to the exchange. Then you can cash it out.

Somebody screwed up. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:27:39
Transfer charges were pretty high at one point. If you’re not paying attention to the fees, yeah, you could lose it that way. (Not criticizing you. I’ve done it on a few transactions when I was clicking fast and not paying attention.)
That would be my argument.

You wouldn’t mine bitcoin with those. You could probably get .9-ish ETH per month. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:35:42
There is. It costs more so that fits your situation. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:00:05
I’ve thought about that. I think the idea has merit. What’s needed is someone or some group to set up the wallets, print the signs, and handle disbursements. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:05:07
That only applies to 2018 taxes and later. Not 2017.  The law wasn’t retroactive.
