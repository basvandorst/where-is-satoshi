We're still over 1000. I'm still happy.

I wish I'd bought in 2015, but I was too cautious. Recently I bought at 780 on the way up and sold at 876 on the way back down, so I'm good. When it stops dropping I'll buy back in and join the "HODL!" crowd, lol.

One of his points is valid, comparing btc to an ounce of gold is invalid. The total value of all bitcoins should be compared to the total value of all gold, or 1 oz of gold should be compared to 0.00318875 btc.

I bought 0.3 at $300 then panicked and sold again at about 400. Now I bought a whole bitcoin at the start of December 2016 and there's no way I'm going to sell it. Maybe when it can pay off my mortgage.

Let's pretend it can. What would that achieve?
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:21:47
If you bought 200 worth of btc at 1050, roughly .19 BTC, and the price rose and you received .18btc. Then you would have something to complain about.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:14:38
Post me cash and I'll send btc when I receive it.

Many people don't have a retirement plan beyond "have enough money to stop working". A real retirement plan need to include lifestyle, what will you do with your time when you've retired. People need a project/hobby/club, something to give their life continued meaning.

Yeah, I'm going to stop watching shortly, check back in a month and see what happened.

I was just trying to make a point. Anyway, I live in Australia. I've never heard of anyone counterfeiting our notes. Also it is easy to take them to a bank or something and have them checked.

Is that 100,000 Princes in Nigeria will accept your bitcoin to help them flee to your country, whereapon they will shower you with ~~gold~~ bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:22:05
I looked at the chart and $935 is $50 above ~885 which is my rough guess at the average for 10-18 hours ago. I was going to say "big deal", but that's about 5% in 3 hours, so "Wheeeee!"  
Let's wait for a rise/fall to last 24 hrs before we post more roller coaster pics. Please?

I meant at the very start. Wasn't one of the first transactions 10,000btc for a pizza?  
Actually I never thought of this before but it should be easy to find out the top 100 wallets and how many btc they contain, right? Not that that would tell you the top 100 btc owners, as they could have multiple wallets.  
My point was that btc would suffer less criticism, like being falsely accused of being a pyramid scheme, if there weren't a small group that had a large percentage of the total bitcoins.

Because you should always trust someone who says "Trust me"

True words.
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:00:33
So does that mean we're likely to sit here for a while, or do you think it could go lower?
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:59:46
Yeah, sure, I'm not saying the people at the start shouldn't have a few thousand bitcoins, but I'm guessing there are a quite a few with 10's of thousands, or maybe even someone with a million bitcoins. Who knows? If those people ever cashed out it would cause a huge drop in the value and while they hold the distribution remains too skewed.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:20:11
Just thought I'd leave this here:  
In 2013 there was 171,300 metric tonnes of gold in circulation. There are a maximum of 21,000,000 Bitcoins. If you take today's gold price of US$1,152/oz, and divide the total value of the worlds gold by the number of Bitcoins, you get US$331,471/Btc.  
So I'd say the price of Bitcoin is still very cheap.
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:07:10
No not really. imho too many btc were released too early, so a few people have disproportionately many of them, but apart from that it's an excellent trading token which is no more like a pyramid scheme than cash money is.

I've learned a lot reading your posts, and I agree with this statement more than the title. :)  
Edit: Do you have a blog or anything?

I'm glad I sold 0.3BTC about a year ago. It made me more certain about keeping the rest.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:27:39
It starts with the same two words, that's slightly.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:18:29
Translation: Bitcoin is gaining momentum and we're concerned that it might go mainstream.

Title says 'teach me like I'm 5', then post says "full understanding".  
I'd propose that a 5 year old couldn't fully understand how bitcoin mining works.  
Pick one or the other.

Not that I would ever actually do it, but what if he put his wallet address in the paypal description? Then the seller could post a link to the bitcoin transaction. Would that not prove he received the btc?
