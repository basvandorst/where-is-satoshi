WTF is going on?

Don't worry there will be always someone who will sell 1 BTC for a price of the moon. So, don't worry about multimillionaires.

By that logic people without 10k don't have 500k no?

Congrats man! Wise decision. I wish I had enough right now to sell and buy a house. In my dreams :)

Well I have 0 BTC will it help me avoid hack attacks?

You only sell when you need to buy something and don't have enough fiat, otherwise HODL!

I'd pay 10k just to receive 500k lmao.

It's not a mass adoption. When we gonna see mass adoption 1 BTC will probably worth $1M or more.

I regret not buying it earlier.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:11

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:29:34
How much have you got if not a secret?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:08:59

@_date: 2017-11-27 12:55:30

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:25

Is binance any good or should I use kraken instead?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:12:20
Off topic, what is the best and easiest site to buy altcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:15:32
What about my already created wallets in other apps. Is there any way to import my addresses into the new app?
