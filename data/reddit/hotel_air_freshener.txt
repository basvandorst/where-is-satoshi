It’s a multi billion dollar unregulated market.  This is  a once in a lifetime for experienced traders and unwise to tread into at this point... unless you like wild 5-30% fluctuations with your money on an hourly basis.

If you’re playing with house money, you’re still gambling.  The utility of 1M$ is much higher than effectively wagering it any further.

I agree.  I'm seeing too many people these days that are investing emotionally, especially in this sector.  Money shouldn't be tied so strongly to your sense of well being.  Bitcoin is facinating, but I'm starting to get suspicious that the positive intentions of the creators and early adopters has been/is being manipulated.  This is no longer what it was intended to be.

The 100k windfall may put you into a different tax bracket thereby totally shifting your tax burden for the year in which you declare the capital gains.  Talk to an accountant is my point, it’s not entirely straightforward as your typical w2.

BCH isn’t at 9k yet,  none of those sell orders are executing.  Every other exchange has it mid 3s except Coinbase where you can’t actually get that price.

I'm with you. We're with you.

This is the currency of the times. Carries the promise of social equailty and the ruthlessness of capitalism.  Wildly volatile and fueled by mistrust in the government.

I used to like bitcoin before it sold out and went corporate. I used to watch it at cbgb’s back in the day but now it’s so big I just think it’s too full of itself now.

It's a valid point. You go to /x subreddit to hear people with views who are in line with x/subreddit.  You're not going to find people who are bearish on bitcoin in this sub. When the bitcoin movie comes out, they'll sift through all the "hodls" and "to the moons" for people that were thinking rationally. We were here, and we tried to speak up but we were downvoted. 
It's up a *thousand percent*.  We're on the moon already. Take some profits crazy people.

Traveled down the road and back again.

That is absolutely not true and will get someone into trouble.  Short term/long term capital gains have different tax implications.

This is a very bold move by coinbase to solidify the stability, and most importantly the value of BCC.  This was essentially done like a stock split except there would have been a mass sell of BCC immediately following the fork.  Coinbase knew this would disrupt the value of both coins if it came to pass and if BCC can hold value it's better for everyone.  This staggered approach will allow a 6 month lead time for BCC to gain traction as an alt coin.  
Additionally the more BCC increases in value, the higher the fee is to cash it out.  This is a massive win for them and hodlrs in general.

Hey bro, if you have a cool mil and a half to throw around at BTC, cheers.  I'm guessing you did well enough at life to have that kind of cash as an investment.  But If you worked for a hedge fund or something, you may have lost your job over this.  Not exactly the wisest of investments.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:39:56
Every few months they give out forks to eat your lobster with.  One of the perks...

Hopefully a bitcoin possession is never a misdemeanor.

Or they're testing the market.  If it's not off it could still be on.  Could be a good way to root out institutional investors and futures speculation.

I agree totally, biding time so people can move funds and getting ready for the currency changeover.  The germans (rightfully) wont lend more and the Greeks don't want to lose their culture to repay a bank loan.

There is a massive latency issue that needs to be addressed before we hit any higher.  Coincrash preceeds system crash as always.  Non consensual hodl. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:27:01
Well yeah but you can't drive a bitcoin...yet. Just look for the next move.

It's obviously a parable. It's the father, son and the hodly coin.

I would keep a journal with your notes in it and then leave some in a library in Venice, give some to Marcus Brody and keep the rest in Alexandretta.
