Never lose if you never sell at a loss. 
We've had, what, four ATH this month alone?
Up up up.

Fees. 
Hell, fees are arguably more profitable already.

Yes.

I have an account on LBC in good standing, same name here as there. 
Send me a message, I'm willing to work with you.

My transactions tend to be in the $100 range - it'll be a long time before I have to think about any shenanigans.

The USPS is pretty good about delivering their parcels.
And the myth of postal employees looking for money in your Christmas cards is without merit; it's common knowledge, especially to postal employees, that Postal Inspectors are constantly on the lookout - to include setting traps to see if an employee falls for it. 
No one is going to risk federal felonies for a handful of twenties.

It's funny, after one guy above suggested Excel... I realized I could cook something up on Spreadsheets.
I went back and found my buys from whereever I bought my coins, and I went to Pax/LBC to track my sales.
Future transactions will be in a better order, but this solves my overall issue of "How much am I making?"
Sadly, I've had a few transactions outside of the marketplaces so they're "off the books" ... so I had to account for them pretty inaccurately, but they work.
This is, of course, just an example.  My official records have me at $47/day, which isn't too bad at all.

It took five hours for the confirmations.

All that would happen is US institutions stop providig easy ways to get coin, but coins were used long before any sort of official recognition took place. 
The value would be affected in some way, but it'd still live on.

Paywall. Boo.

You could do Cash In Mail to some American, but the delays would be pretty frustrating.

All of Amazon, 15% off.

If coinbase behaves like PayPal, they'll leave your account in the negative and eventually sell your debt to a collection agency for you to ignore.

Clear net purchase service. 
Purse.io works for Amazon (and I love it so)
But how about a service that I pay in coin and it then makes a purchase for me on some other site?
Anonymous online shopping even with merchants that don't take coin.

Find an American that'll sell you coins for cash in the mail. 
There are a bunch around. 
Hell, I'd do it but everyone looks at me funny when I offer.
(hint: it's an offer)

You're not counting the $500 worth of product. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:25:25
Sure, if you want your coinbase account closed.

You'd still have to pay income taxes on wages earned in your home state.
