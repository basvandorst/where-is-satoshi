call me stupid, call me dumb call me whatever you want
 
I went and deposit into coindouble.com after seeing their post here ( shortly removed by the way )
I am reading various ponzi / scam alerts about this and overall just negative....
 
I am well over 20 hours in and everything goes flawless, so basically my question is
why are threads like this removed from here within seconds, and why are sites like:
 
from badbitcoin.org
 
Why would somebody want to double your bitcoin? Seriously, wake up. 12/26/15
 
saying this about them, while my experience is positive ( for now )
I am by no way involved with coindouble.com
 
All I can say is their email support does work I got fast and very helpful replies , and they do pay out, so I dont understand the negativity around things like this
I mean does it not need like some kind of prove before a company like this is being trashed

this Guy is a total scammer, tried to purchase from me thru Mycelium. Told me his coins were in escrow with Mycelium and was willing to sell at 30% below market value. I still have the screenshots and all
The reply from Mycelium :
Hello Marcus,
no - there is no such thing as an escrow. Good thing you have asked - there are always people trying to scam others.
Localtrader is only meant to find others and meet them face-to-face and exchange cash, as all other payment options are reversible while bitcoin is not.

Its designed for a safe storage long term,
keep your coins on them and have a smaller amounts on your phone or pc wallet for daily use.
I would not trust hooking up my trezor on a "public" machine. 
I would suggest to use the trezor only on your own Pc, but maybe Im wrong. I am very pleased with this device the only bad thing I can think of is the Usb cable what comes with it, its an absolute crap quality cable.
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:23:57
They banned it and came up with their own, I do see some activity on localbitcoin but not much. They do bitcoin meetings and what more here in Quito. I believe the ban is more for merchant and accepting then anything else. I mean what could they possibly do If you own? And I do own way before the ban.

I am very proud to say that Ecuador is added because of me!
I ordered last October and shipped by regular mail.
That took them 8 days and I received it in my office.
I wonder if more people here in Ecuador have one by now
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:48:38
Yeah I would think the lower Bitcoin is the more orders you should accept, but hey thats just me.
Beside that you can also setup merchant accounts with a "set" time value, that way you never lose and never gain and change it back to fiat
I wish you the best of luck
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:45:53
I have the same question basicly.

Ops post sounds like an excuse and trying to explain and defend. There is no need, it is very clear that the cost of development needs to be paid and could go down slowly depending on how many are sold. Copying a product and therefor eliminating the complete develop and research cost will off course result in a cheaper price. This being said I stick with my product from my czech friends. Their product rules, their support is excellent and their shipping outstanding. Paying a $119, for a product what gives you this kind of safety should not even be an issue.

First thing I did is bought a Nokia Usb cable what is in my opinion a really high quality cable.
Imagine people like myself who are far from Bitcoin experts can have this device at and transfer in a easy and secure way to their Hot wallets or 3rd parties and in case of damage or loss order a new one and recover your entire coins with seed.
Something good have to be said on those things as well I believe.

Coinbase treated me really well, all my buying transactions went smooth for high value during a period of 7 months. Then a sale came and suddenly we had a little hick up and the sale never went thru. Then I received the following mail:
Hi  
Last week, we experienced a rare issue while processing deposits for some customers. While these deposits were delayed, we can confirm that they are now in transit to your account. Depending on your bank’s deposit policies, they will post within 2-4 business days. 
Given that Monday, September 1 is a US holiday (Labor Day), we expect that you should receive these funds in your bank account no later than Friday, September 5. 
We understand that this has been inconvenient for you and would like to sincerely apologize. Going forward, we have implemented several measures to ensure this does not happen again. 
As this was entirely our fault, we have credited your account with a refund of your transaction fee ($557.81), PLUS an additional $557.81. This refund has been credited to your Coinbase account in bitcoin (2.19665578 BTC). 
Again, we are very sorry for this issue. We appreciate your patience and understanding while we work to perfect our services. 
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
If that is not a great customer service then what is...
also all my questions concerns I had in the past were answered quickly. Coinbase also had questions towards me due to high volume purchases, I have nothing to hide answered their concerns and we were back to normal.
I read negative and positive things related to Coinbase, I only and only have very positive history with them.

Yes there are "some" traders, when I set op a coffee place accepting Btc they made it illegal like a week later and had to close down that payment option. I think that selling Items in stores or where ever cannot be done with Btc but trading is perfectly legal.

went to the Clearance section, chose 3 items. Went thru the whole thing like color, size, qty and then it said "out of stock" you might want to mention this. If you need an example :   chose color and size leave the qty at 1 and see the result. I did this with 2 items more and had the same results

none....op is just trying to let you sign up, 90% of the links posted here contain the same shit of signing up. Many articles here you cannot read the past the 1st 10 lines without signing up.
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:05:33
in my opinion a PIN option doesnt harm, I use it on myCel wallet as well. It can be a watch wallet only, but some people like to keep it private for their eyes only like myself.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:40:26
is this US only?
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:58:37
Another one for you: Just downloaded the Update. After putting in the Pin code, then exit ....then excecute the app again it just opens without asking the PIN. This tells you that the app never really closes if you do not kill it manually. Also If you re open the app , enter settings and Uncheck the PIN it does not ask you for the old PIN in order to deactivate.

I am using it after mytrezor lite did not scan the block chain anymore, the people from Trezor guided me to this app. Works good, on android 5.1.1 even though the app asks you if you want to exit it still runs in the background. Other then that, works, and a very nice clean UI
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:47:46
Yup, and saying 0.24 Btc is a lot for OP that can be , but putting it all on the line with an online betting site and saving on a couple of cents in order to get it there in a normal time does not make much sense either. Im done here.
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:13:40

@_date: 2015-02-21 03:30:03
stay away from them as far as you can, here you have a nice example :
Marcus, Your account came to my attention after a recent large bitcoin transaction. I have reviewed some of the prior questions asked of you and I have reviewed your account and website. I need to learn a bit more about the source of funds used to purchase bitcoin. You have purchased approximately $+++,+++ worth of bitcoin and if I read the previous emails correctly you are using revenue from your flower sales to fund these purchases. With the price of bitcoin steadily decreasing that seems to be an interesting strategy. In August and September you conducted some large buys of bitcoin. Can you please provide a bank statement showing the funds showing how those transactions were funded (the buys in August and September of 2014)?
Also, can you explain the strategy behind using your corporate revenue to purchase bitcoin. Are you sending it off coinbase to someone else? Are you buying bitcoin for someone else? In general how re you funding your US bank account while you are in Ecuador? As part of our due diligence requirements and state examinations we have to be able to show that we have a full understanding of purchases made with bitcoin. Especially with accounts that have done so much transaction activity in a short period of time.
If you are buying bitcoin for other people it would be helpful if you could explain your process for doing that.
Until we can get some comfort with the level of purchases on the account I have restricted the ability to buy and sell bitcoin. Once you send in the requested information we’ll review and discuss next steps.
Respectfully, John

This was 2 weeks ago, after my replies with none being answered I emailed them: After receiving not only an insulting email from a fellow named "John"
but also this person did not even bother to respond any further and treating like I am some kind of criminal you may hereby close my account for all I care.
I do not need this kind of treatment.
regards to John and we are done.
Also this has not been answered, I am very much done with this company who represent themselves only with 1st names and no additional contact information

It is not bullshit, or I wont even post this. I do not understand that I did to receive this treatment. yes I purchase large amounts, but its all paid in full with USD clean after taxes. I cannot decide what I am doing with my savings it seems.
