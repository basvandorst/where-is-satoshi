You’re buying but you’re sure it’ll go down. 
It sounds like a bad plan...

Can you explain what you mean here? 
Does this mean there were lots of sales of bitcoin this morning and then the price shot right up.

Would anyone recommend consolidating investments to bitcoin or is it worth having a spread of crypto?

Millions?! How were they allowed to borrow so much BC? 
I remember when I was a kid, I used to bet lots on football (soccer). You’d start out with, say, £10 and bet on there being no more goals at about 88 minutes into a 90 minute match. 
The odds were tiny but incrementally, by betting all your winnings, you could get quite a bit in the kitty. 
Then someone would score at 90 minutes and you’d lose everything... 
This seems similar.

I realised about 3 weeks ago I needed to delete the Coinbase app and stop checking. It’s been making me miserable since I bought in late December. Not looking at it every day was a complete help. 
I checked in the price today by chance (there was a link on BBC) and it’s the first good news in ages!
Been looking at it and checking back regularly like you.

Ohhh so they ended up with less money than they started?
Tough gig :(

Well. I’ve learnt something today.

That sounds like a UK Broadband supplier.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:14:49
Man, I didn’t really understand any of that.

Agreed. 
Problem is a lot of people will lose a lot of money before it’s accepted and trusted.

New investors: these days invest for fun.
Never get bought in like this person. 
Hopefully you’ll make some cash but that’s the gamble.
Sell if you like and don’t be pressured to ‘buy the dip’. If you look at the post history of this site, you’ll see people said that at 9k 8k 7k 6k 5k 4K and they’ll say it at 3 2 and 1.
