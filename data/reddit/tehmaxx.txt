He isn’t though, this isn’t the first time it’s crashed and it’s not the end of crypto.
John seems like the kind of guy that doesn’t realize he has to invest for retirement and has to work till he’s 70 because he couldn’t save $50 a paycheck at 25 because investing is a “scam”.

None of what you said is anything but opinion based conjecture.
Warren Buffet has lost over a billion dollars while investing in something he thought was a good idea, the biggest difference is he had 90 billion more. Using him as a baseline for your investment portfolio is idiotic at best and treating crypto like a stock is even more evidence that you have no clue what the fuck you’re talking about.
People like you with their bad “advise” came along and “sided” things like this before and still can’t explain why the person that bought into bitcoin at $50 made a “bade choose” when bitcoin is still at $12,000.

You’re trying to convince a person stuck in the past.
Technology for them isn’t improvements on something that exists, it’s something new. 
These are the same people that can’t grasp why supersonic passenger air travel is needed because “air travel is already good and super sonic already failed once”
They want something crazy that’ll never instantly develope, advancements or improvements on existing tech isn’t a logical step for them because they’re technologically illiterate but too ignorant to realize it because “I know how to use computers” 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:16:03
Well you likely isolate yourself from the people who use it as currency.
The guy that bailed on it and posted on the BTC sub about getting out and paying off his debts like his house are the best examples of those.
The investors in it that Hodl it are no different than someone who didn’t cash out their Investments when the recession hit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:26:59
Oh so you mean the technology is making advancements?
Much like bitcoin is an advancement in currency?
You mean to tell me you make minor leaps instead of large ones? Like we are doing with green energy?
Who would have thought!?

Your point is unnecessary and irrelevant. 
Your edit after my reply is cute, adding a 200% more text and completely changing the meaning of your initial post.

You can cry “liar” all you want because you’re lying and need to shift attention, idgaf but it’s clear my reply was to a post that you completely changed so that people replying would look silly.
Your projections and insults just undermine your cowardice.

1 year old account that only screeches about very specific things in threads at random for the life of the account.
If you could aggregate the comments that account posts in you could probably find a single user that’s also present in those threads and be confident that it’s his real account

Because it’s more likely the guy that is railroading politics in replies to another guy that didn’t say “liberal” or “republican” at all in his post is closer to that projection as hominem attack than me.

Which is fine if he made profit, he got a ride and that’s all that matter.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:53:08
Well the idea with stocks is to buy in a valley and sell at a peak so that you have more capital to do it again when it valleys again or to walk away from it completely.
If it dips to 7k and I buy 100,000 worth and it spikes to 8k again.
14 coins worth 7k turns into a profit of 14k which means 2 more shares the next time you do it.
Doing this over and over is much more profitable than doing it once and sitting on it for a year and affords you a large gain when it peaks at 9k instead of stopping at 8.5.
But yeah if you bought in at $1 for 1BTC then sitting on it until now likely made you pretty rich.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:15:27
How would you fail? You can’t just wait till it valleys by 1k and buy in and wake for it to jump again? Are they impatient? Does it not work like a stock in that it’s easy to buy/sell?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:14:58
You don’t have to watch it all day, alerts on your computer or phone can manage this.
Day traders don’t camp one stock and they do it to make money. There aren’t many jobs that allow you to make 14k in a day with only 100k in liquid capital.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:30:19
Except both Uber and Airbnb are flirting with regulations and on the verge of being killed off in various municipalities.
The bitcoin can also be seized by governments like so many have in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:28:37
So could you buy it like a stock and ride the 1k gains and valleys?

It was artificially inflated by a small group of people, once those people bailed on the market the price was obviously going to plummet. All you’re seeing now is bitcoin returning to its actual “value” which will be slightly higher than what it was before it was put inside the rocket ship.

Reddit and investing advice is hilarious.
“Just buy low and sell high!”
“It’s only a loss if you sell!”
“If you’re losing money you’re doing it wrong!”
“That guy sold too soon, he’s dumb”
