I know it works better than keeping btc on any exchange, that's enough for me to buy it
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:17:50
When you're a beginner, I'd highly suggest you to use an online wallet for bitcoins, for example blockchain.info. You don't have to run any programs on your PC 24/7 and you see your bitcoins instantly and can spend it instantly.
Bitcoin core is for more advanced users or developers.
@_date: 2016-08-22 20:20:10
It's been down for a while now 
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:59:18
Yes your funds will be visible in your wallet after this is synchronized. They are happily waiting for you
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:56:40
Bitcoin core + new user
Not the best combination ever. Is your wallet synchronized with network already?
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:21:09
Just saw it, looks awesome
@_date: 2016-04-19 04:59:18
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:33:44
Numbers on the left side aren't accurate. If I hover mouse over the graph, it says about 200 MB
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:29:36
Not really. There is a possiblity of finding a private key of that address.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:42:47
It's a valid bitcoin address like any other, so why impossible? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:10:07
Hmm I see, weird. I haven't seen any transactions containing more than 1 address in a single output
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:14:41
It would be much easier to implement, if it had full support in the Bitcoin Core node.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:31:47
Because you used low transaction fee
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:45:04
You would have to wait 2 weeks for difficulty adjustment and then you could mine blocks on your laptop ez pz
// my bad, would be a bit more than 2 weeks lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:01
If you are dealing with hundreds of thousands of $, you probably want to be little more cautious
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:04:45
If I'm not mistaken, soft forks are basically optional updates. How would you force miners to actually use something they wouldn't benefit from?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:30:20
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:42:28
You are totally wrong. GUI is not the only thing that's missing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:05:15
Each output is one address
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:33:42
What does that mean? But anyways, I can see not all of those are "puzzle".
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:02:48
I'm not begging Coinbase but Bitcoin Core development team if you didn't notice. And btw, I do own a hardware wallet, but it's not very suitable to use in a shop that sends transactions daily 24/7
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:28:24
There have been some collisions found already.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:45:18
I don't think it's possible to create 1 output containing 2 addresses. 
 (line 335)
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:40:19
Yes. Miner can choose even 0 transactions (if you dont count coinbase tx)
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:52:00
Please, Bitcoin Core, release full support for segwit already. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:06:40
Do you mine Bitcoin with GPUs? How is that even possible? Maybe I can recommend you mining some altcoins and later if you wish, exchange it for BTC. There's nothing much you can do about your current situation, it's a normal behaviour of all wallets which can't be prevented.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:28:12
With the current situation it may take a while. There are currenty 100 000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool 
This is a good representation 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:34:05
it's sad
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:50:19
You have sent 7x bigger transaction fee than neccessary. It would be "just" $23, because you have used many inputs
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:33:47
If I'm not mistaken, it is a valid bitcoin address. However, guessing the private key is virtually impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:21:09
Even if you use same address for receiving 7 transactions, there would be 7 inputs which would make transaction size bigger. I'd suggest waiting until situation with bitcoin gets better, also, use only Segwit addresses in the future to reduce fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:28:17
Maybe this:
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:37:25
Actually, it doesn't really matter if 1 person mines Bitcoin or the whole world would. Difficulty always adjusts itself to mine blocks every 10 minutes. You can help by using Segwit.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:08:02


Damn I run Bitcoin Core wallet, am I at risk?
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:54:52
Wow, I can't even count how many unconfirmed outputs before there are. 
There are like 100 of them that needs to get confirmed first before your transaction can get confirmed
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:26:58
Point of this wasn't how long I'm going to wait, but that bitcoin.conf didn't affect my fee. And fixed that already
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:25:38
I use automated system which set fee on start at 0.0001
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:48:09
I'm not sending these transactions manually, I've been using "settxfee" command, but how do I change it to use recommended fees
@_date: 2016-03-04 18:54:59
I'm not sending transactions manually but automatically with javascript code, which should just make recommended fee or at least it should listen to my config 
btcclient.cmd('sendtoaddress', bitcoin_address, amount, function(err, btc_tx, resHeaders){ }
//I've edited fee in GUI and will see what will happen now
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:10:14
I assume the oldest one has a bit lower fee, but still 36 hours is a bit too much, I heard bitcoin transaction gets rejected after some time, is that true? 
Also I'm using bitcoin-qt and is there any feature to adjust fee depending on size of trsanctions?
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:11:50
There's nothing like that in any library, I've been using settxfee before, but that's just not good.
Maybe you're right that bitcoin gui could override the bitcoin.conf settings
//I just tested editing setting in GUI and you are right, I can type whatever I want in config, but bitcoin-qt will use settings from GUI, thanks I didn't think about it that way
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:39:26
Are you new to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:45:29
A friend of mine is having a same problem, most likely blockchain has some issues
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:39:34
Just Bitcoin Things.
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:26:35
I'd be interested to see some data :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:53:53
Does Xapo keep balance in your card in Bitcoins or directly on deposit it convert all bitcoins to usd?
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:43:10
We can see $300 tomorrow, we can see $1300 tomorrow, do whatever you feel like it's worth
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:03:24
give txid
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:31:44
What do you mean?
//I know what fees should I use, I'm asking why Bitcoin Core doesn't know it even close
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:15:03
So now you expect apoligize or what? Kids who can't afford to lose are laughing and they are the first ones who sell after a drop, it's been always like that and will always be like that, don't get bothered
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:27:56
It's been running for 2 weeks at least
//for some reason it say "Uptime 7 hours" on bitnodes website, but I'm not aware of restarting the Bitcoin Core in any way today
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:12:03
I'm trying to implement some sort of system to my business that would accept 0-conf transactions under these conditions. I'll be happy to lose 0.5 BTC and learn more things I don't know 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:43:09
Well, I just used CPFP method, which basically cost me 2x more.
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:42:18
There's been several people making post about enormously high fees in Bitcoin Core in the past.
I have no settings affecting fee in bitcoin.conf
I'll send you the debug file in PM
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:19:21
Hmm interesting, seems like there's no possible way to accept 0-conf tx as merchant in secure way
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:51:07
Not that much benefits, I will basically wait for more updates.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:07:22
Unfortunatelly failed, but I think you're trying it in a good way
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:11:09
It's a typical bcash troll, don't mind him
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:49:34
I forgot to specify, second transaction must be send to different address. I'm not sure how RBF works as I didn't study it in any way
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:38:03
Oh you just won :) 
I've sent 0.5 to you

I'll be happy to lose and learn more about this
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:41:39
Oh thanks for info.
However, I'm really curious how could merchants with tens of thousands of dollars could accept 0-conf deposits on their services. It's coinbase feature that you can accept 0-conf transactions
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:05:53
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:52:13
If I'm counting correctly, your first transaction fee per bytes in satoshi is only 56, current fastestFee in the API provided is 80
//my bad I saw bad transaction
//your double spend just failed
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:36:16
At least $300 / btc will be easy 
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:41:13
I messaged you :)
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:28:16
Doesn't matter how many miners are using full RBF, if I just see any that transaction one to the merchant is RBF, I can just not accept it. Correct me if I'm wrong
But how can I possibly protect myself from CPFP transactions? I can never actually know if the buyer won't use this method.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:24:15
Failed again
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:57:01
Use Dogecoin for lower fees 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:09:10
That's what I what told when segwit support was shifted from 0.15.1 to 0.15.2. Segwit2x has been called off, so what made them delay segwit support for half a year?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:34:29
It's not only GUI. It lacks basic things like generating segwit change address and segwit addresses without the need of creating non-segwit address first.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:03:35
You are wrong. Segwit GUI will come in half a year in 0.16
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:28:58
0.15.2 is finished and doesn't include anything regarding segwit
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:05:13
Wait for 0.16
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:50:28
I've been using them for a long time and expect some downtimes, never had issue. You can set custom fee and if you really want, even export your private keys and do whatever you want with your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:46
How do you want exchanges, payment processors and wallet adopt segwit if Bitcoin Core doesn't even have full segwit support? Wait for Bitcoin Core support, then expect people to actually use segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:59:52
Basic things like generating segwit addresses without needing to create random "normal" address every time. Generating segwit change addresses. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:11:56
Not neccessarily. You can't generate only segwit addresses by default, you can't make segwit change addresses.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:53:13
You missed it
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:08:11
Next version means 0.16?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:08:22
So export your private keys to another wallet
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:10:07
Most likely in a few days. You can keep an eye on this  [ 
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:41:12

Easy way to transfer millions with $0.04 fee lol 
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:03:00
I mean, I know blockchain is down pretty often, but usually there are atleast past transactions and it says 0 nodes connected, but now it says nodes are connected and there's literally nothing on the site, blank site.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:32:50
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:49:20
Seems like a very nice progress. My 0.14 node says 290 sat/b for 6 blocks and 0.15 says 51/31 sat/b. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:40:44
Currently, even 30 sat/b fee would be enough, which would make the fee of 226 byte transaction $0.38

First of all, Bitcoin is not mined with GPUs, but ASIC chips. Basically, it works somehow like this:
More ASICs mining bitcoin = more difficulty = harder to mine
Less ASICs mining bitcoin = less difficulty = easier to mine
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:13:29
Mempool just got cleared, check in some blockchain explorer if your transaction got confirmed or not. For example here:
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:28:40
This might help you.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:02:07
Thanks I didn't know about this, at least something
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:25:38
Do you have transaction id or at least address where you've sent the bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:15:37
I believe most merchants use such services because it allow them to basically accept Bitcoin and receive US$ without worrying about Bitcoin price volatility. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:29:49
Well, would be fun to leave them with all of their coins on their chain alone and hardfork from them and reverse all of their purchases on the new chain
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:51:15
We would let them buy all the bitcoins and then hardfork from them. gg ez
@_date: 2016-10-10 04:36:21
Yeah, just to be safe, you know
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:56:55
You are actually wrong, there's no 1 MB size cap since Segwit, but 4 MB of weight is the limit.
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:07:14
Man, but we should wait for ALL confirmations
@_date: 2016-10-08 18:46:44
He needs to be verified (send ID and be at least 18 years old) on Opskins in order to cashout via BTC.
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:20:35
This is a problem because if any merchant accepts bitcoin payments, he waits usually for at least 1 confirmation. And buyer needs to wait several hours for his bitcoin transaction to be confirmed, which is totally uncomfortable for both. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 09:38:04
Does this happen only on blockchain or generally with all BTC transactions? Because same happened to me yesterday and still isn't resolved after 14 hours.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:08:36
How long it takes to receive payment from that site? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:57:28
Isn't it 19% + 17.2% for health care? So would be 36.2% in the end 
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:04:33
I used my wallet right in blockchain.info
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:41:09
I have same problem man, sent ~$2200 but it's still unconfirmed, I don't have the BTC, but the other side doesn't have it too. Could you possible help me somehow? I'd really appreciate.
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:24:47
Sorry didn't really understand that part as I'm not native English speaker. Thank you anyways
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:19:05
Just took a look at the Circle and they required phone number verification and there's $300 weekly sending limit, and if I want more, they want my documents lol. What's the point of anonym bitcoins then ^^ 
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:04:44
I used my wallet right in blockchain.info, I'm glad it's confirmed now
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:45:48
Guys, does anyone know any similliar more reliable wallet than blockchain? I need something simple, fast. I took a look at blocktrail but that's just too simple, the value of BTC aren't refreshing in realtime, there are like no settings at all, it's rounding my BTC, but I want to see exactly how much I have, no possible of making more wallets, not any statistics, nothing at all. I also tied MultiBit, Electrum, Armory, noone of them fit my requirement lol. They are either too complicated, or too simple.  In those wallets I can't see how much US$ is my BTC worth in real time so I'd have to use another site to check it all the time. I know, I'm difficult guy.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:48:55
Thanks a lot man, I really appreciate it, the other guy just confirmed he received the BTC. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:29:13
Someone commented but I cant see it :/
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:14:50
I don't think the issue is in the fee, or is it? Why would it has 0% network propagation?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:03:22
I guess Bitcoin pools can include specific transactions to blocks if I'm correct.
@_date: 2016-10-30 11:46:08
Just another day of blockchain. Unreliable service as hell. 
I've been testing some things on blockchain for a few days now, and every single day it was down for some time.
