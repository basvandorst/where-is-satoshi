Thanks Swag!

I'll play if you play Swag!

Ok, I guess the site isn't frozen, but it says my funds are in play when I am not at a table. I can't even sit down.

They haven't even had one single real money hand yet, how are they a major site?

I don't think the site is specifically targeted at US players as they offer deposit options other than bitcoin for the international crowd. Bitcoin deposits for US players is the loophole to let them participate.

Yay, Infiniti's up! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:54:51
Is anyone going to sit down and play? C'mon people, Infiniti is finally live!

Read that earlier and it all sounds great. I understand that you're still in soft launch, but c'mon, throw a freeroll or something out there before Jan 1 instead of just saying, "after 2 years of anticipation and beta, we're finally open, come on over." Why aren't you or Gavin on the tables tonight? Why as of this time are there only 5 people logged in and nobody on any tables? Get on the forums. Scream if you have to that you're now live. Open a few SNG's. Hell, unlock all the options on the client. For as long as you were in beta, you should know if they work or not.

I'm not hating Swag, been waiting as long as anybody and am genuinely excited that Infiniti is finally live. As much love as I have for you and "Toad", how can Infiniti be considered a major site when the most people I've seen on there all night is 7, and not one real money hand has transpired. I hope he is from the future and you guys kick some major ass, but after a 2 year wait for live poker, you still have to prove that you're a little bit better than what's being offered to be considered a "major player." Again, not hating, I can't wait to deposit, but give me a reason to come over from Seals.

site's frozen

You're right. I guess we'll have to wait and see what they offer after the official launch. I know that if I had the option to play on Pokerstars, there would be no question where I would play because of the traffic alone. Competitive rake, a good tournament schedule, fast cash-outs, and obviously a decent size player base might make Infiniti a nice alternative for international players. We will see Jan 1 I guess.

Rub it in why don't ya'....lol. This site will never be Pokerstars, but it can be a nice, niche alternative for those looking for something different. Again, we'll see.
