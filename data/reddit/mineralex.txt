They actually gave that 90 Ghs.

I dont think all cloud minings are scam as I am using CloudMining.website myself and they are paying consistently. I can show Tx id for their payment proof. I checked that their average return is 90% of the theoretical amount. That, I guess, is a good sign.

It is now up and running fine...

True that they are paying well. But, after AM hash fiasco, I do not trust any other mining firm.

Sorry. Could not understand your wording.

Donate FIAT, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is too valuable to be donated. I have learnt it in the hard way. Years ago, I donated 1 BTC.

Can a Miner manipulate the winning?

Guyz, GBminers is backed by GainBitcoin Ponzi. Actually, GB = GainBitcoin. There has been lots of discussion regarding this on BitcoinTalk, but these scammers are desperate. They dont have a fraction of the hash rate they are selling. If u think about investing over there, please read these 2 threads beforehand...

Polo already requires email auth on each and every login from desktop. Dont they need such a thing for app users?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:58:40
I dont use the app. I access Polo from desktop.

Rather than gold/fiat I'd suggest him to buy some hash power. It costs just 8 BTC to buy 10 Ths at  So, he might buy 30 Ths with 24 BTC and hold on to 1 BTC. I think, this investment strategy will be fruitful in the long run. According to  he would be making 2.02 BTC per week with 30 Ths.

This is a fantastic idea to cheer up a sad market.

Any source to back this claim?

I heard Bitmain employed FriedCat in their Israel office. Can we get him back now? He stole 21 BTC from me.

Is block.io giving the private keys of the multisig addresses generated with their wallet?
