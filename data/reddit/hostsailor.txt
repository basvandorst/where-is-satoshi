As a side note, servers are physically located in Netherlands.

We are pretty confident that many out there are cheap, but we are more confident that their features aren't as good as ours, we offer all in one, check our features they will make the difference you're after.

Yes, shouldn't be a problem.

We do not understand why would you post such a lie on here? there is no such complaint/issue in our ticketing system for the past weeks, and this is most certainly not how we operate, we would never falsify paperwork, nor do we ever have such reputation, you are falsifying this story, and you haven't even mentioned one true word within your claim.
And to prove that to you, there is no such thing as buying 1TB and finding 200GB, because bandwidth isn't physical like a hard disk or RAM, its just a number we use to count your bandwidth usage that you can use to download/upload, also we do not have any server with 799 USD a month with addons that we sold recently nor did we sell a server worth 4794 USD for 6 months, and if we did you better show us a screen shot instead of writing full lies, so paste us some proofs about your claim? because from the start of your claim to the end, its pure none sense and lies.
When you pay a provider 4794 USD, its hard to believe that they would give you a VPS worth pennies instead of giving you a real dedicated server, and on top of that you claiming we didn't give you 32GB ram but 4GB ram, I mean really how stingy can a provider be to do that to you, and to ask you to wait for a month, just one big lie, and you didn't act it well.
