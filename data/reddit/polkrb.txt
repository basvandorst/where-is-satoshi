Doesnt matter. The point was that no specific party is leaning pro or against bitcoin. It depends on specific people.

Yes, and I'm 100% in BTC.

Not true. Russian gov hates RT news. RT bashes everyone and it's very independent.

Fuck no. I live in Colorado and want to go somewhere warmer :)

PussyCoin will rule the world
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:24:05
Why not :)

Really? RT stands for Russia Today. It's an independent Russian News Channel.

Because bitcoin is so much better and more valuable than fiat, I prefer to keep bitcoins until I spend my last dollar. If I have dollars in my pocket, I will be spending them first because they inflate and will be worth not more than a piece of paper soon enough.

It's a good test to see what might happen if anything... If something bad, it better happen to namecoin than bitcoin.

Apple already blocking all bitcoin related apps in AppStore. This is crazy.
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:07:49
Correct. It's Russian-created, but now Worldwide news outlet. I like that they are very independent. They are like open source of news.

Al Gore: I'm a Big Fan of Bitcoin

No he didn't, but it doesn't prevent him from saying what he really doesn't believe because he's got a nice paycheck from someone who's interests he is defending...
