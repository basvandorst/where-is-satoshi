He did it as an Early xmas present to his best buddy Roger.
I sent my bcash off gdax and already exchanged.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:16:47
Bcash and what it represents is not why i started buying BTC, i cant hold it no matter the price trend.
Bcash is everything that is wrong with cypto its the wall street of cypto basically.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:11:32
Think I will raspberry pi this for sure
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:48:39
Let's not,  because there are better coins out there if you look to transact with than bcash. If that's your only purpose. Like litecoin my preferred choice.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:06:10
This like trumps bastard son.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:16:59
New kids on the block sing im forever blowing bubbles .
Makes sense to help create a bubble than invest in one.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:04:59
One minute they upvoting posts that say bitcoin will change the world order, fuck bitcoin cash etc. 
Next they selling for a lambo. The sooner this flock sell out the better and the good news is theres post after post of these people. 
House sale funds deposited with JPMorgan, congrats glad you reached your 'moon'.
Congrats you sold an asset likely to out perform all others. An asset that could give you a ticket to a moon shot. Now sit on the side and watch.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:53:02
Nice little site, cool project. I think I'll probably raspberry pi a lightening node as bitcoin needs it. Not working well as a currency right now.

Getting kind of sick of these posts, again and again and again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:48
As I mentioned before I think they will stagger the ability to sell and move to stabilise the market. I probably would of held it but the bcash team are such massive twats.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:39
Tried selling, wont let me, tried to move out and exchange but is sat on processing list. So you cant actually sell or move the funds.
You get a transfer id, but no hash on gdax.
I reckon they are going to stagger withdrawls and ability to sell to stabalise the bcash value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:16:19
Makes sense, two way traffic !
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:02:16
 Bitcoin bastard
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:00:53
Lightening will soon make cash irrelevant. We need it though quickly  and thing above $1500 for that shit is a win in my book. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:31:20
Wrong  deluded and want bcash to succeed. If you think litecoin is expensive or slow to transact with you are correct to not want to talk about altcoins. 
Bcash has a large market cap because it was given to people for free and they are storing it, if it want a fork it wouldn't even be a top 100 coin because it does nothing that needs doing and that hasn't already been done.
What's more the 'CEO' of this coin is a total tard, as well as the other 2.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:04:18
Because your wrong and bcash is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:52
I agree litecoin is better than bch for transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:28
The issue is with the mempool which is also being spammed. The release of lightening will make BTC simple evolve into something alot better, whilst keeping the greatness of the code that exists.
When it comes scaling wont be an issue and micro transactions will add a new element. I personally cant wait. Then BTC will be a coin i can use all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:27:14
problem is fees to move the funds, its not working as a currency. We needed a solution like yesterday. Consumers will choose what more efficient and easier. That has to fiat right now if not litecoin, fuck bcash.
We need everyone to move to segwet
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:12:19
just meme it
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:40
Im moving it to another exchange and swapping it directly.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:48:26
You replied to you own question almost, segwit would help loads but no ones using it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:48
Its not a bitcoin a REAL bitcoin is worth about 11x the value of that coin.
Think of a intel celeron, for 11x the price you could have an i7. Thats the difference between a real bitcoin and bitcoin trash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:34
I got rid of my bch today and exchanged for another coin, i also prefer to use a provider that offers more coins and has less market influence.
Im not out of cypto, i just want to be out of coinbase.

Push for segwit and use that, solution is there but no one's using it. Have segwit on nano s never had an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:10
Heres to gav having long healthy life.

I used binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:29:56
I dont know what the fuck you said, but im upvoting that shit and nodding at the same time !
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:56:37
Really good and easy to use
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:12:19
Plus I dont see it doing anything that litecoin already did. Btc needed lightening like yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:35:31

 Q/ went to Bitcoin.com and they recommended Luno.com. It says I have 1 Bitcoin TRASH in my wallet. Is this the real Bitcoin or did I just fuck up?
A/ You fucked up !
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:28:05
Ether is exposed to the same attacks as BTC, and isn't primarily a currency coin, also as ether gets more expensive so does using sits resources which is shot in the foot.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:56:14
What kid of hardware requirements to run a lightening mode ?
Are you talking raspberry pi and bandwidth here ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:27
I couldn't agree more with your comments sir.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:54
It wasn't long ago I was saving up all week to buy a cassette either. There are a lot of not long ago. 
Bitcoins proven itself. It's not going away, the higher it goes the more stable the price.  The more stable the more it will adopted as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:17:47
will recommend bcash for them then. Hopefully price can fall to about $1 so they can afford a whole one.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:54:23
Guys bitcoin can change the whole worlds financial structure.
BTW I'm out ordered a lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:07:48
love the way you say bitcoins, alot of people dont even have a bitcoin, price is $17,000 in case you didn't notice. 
I basically skint my arse out just to get 1 whole BTC and its christmas, Soon enough the people who have 'Bitcoins' is not going to be many if people keep cashing out.
Ive basically got way to excited and invested to much (probably) but i believe in the tech and think things are only really getting started.
just saying my 2 cents.
To have 'Bitcoins' your so lucky. To sell out to buy a house, a car, all that shit i just dont get it because people are buying in now and this is what you have been holding for all along, and your pussying out at the first hurdle. 
Next year will be bigger and better, the balls only just started rolling.
Im not cashing out shit all, in all the way.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:27:40

Bitcoin was created by Putin Dictatorship, who has a master to everyones  master keys.
If that happened, it would be bad.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:09:19
I use segwit, but coinbase seemed to still give me a rapey transfer fee. ? I thought they supported it ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:42:03
I buy Btc, Eth, LTC, XVG and XRB but im not buying that BCC shit ever, nor does it deserve a place on my Nano S. Its a proper definition of a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:49
Trying to with draw bcash to another exchange but stuck on order no hash, likely they will stager ability to sell transfer to try and stablise any price moves and keep movement off the bcash mempool.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:26:33
Hi, if you look at this trademark its registered a text, your using it in a logo i presaume. 
More importantly the trademark is not filed under the category for apparel.
So they have no right to tell you to stop selling t shirts, if you are using the original bitcoin logo.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:56:22
Used segwit on nano s other day funds arrived rapid and cheaply 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:39:50
Little more difficult when not USD based, as currency moves could pose a big risk.  Also fees etc etc. 
Now I'm at 1, I can just get bits here and there. I think litecoin could do well as a currency it's stable, but bitcoin is where it's at investment wise long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:50:29
Up vote this shit
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:45:26
Pump and dump !
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:46:32
Hi i use a nano S, but basically you just a create a segwit receive address and use it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:45:43
The first time i used a segwit address the other day, i was really impressed at the speed and cost.
So this is why i questioned, almost the need to bitcoin cash.

@_date: 2017-09-28 10:04:24
As i understand the ledger is stored on the bitchain which is protected by the 12 wordphase and hence there could be unlocked via any client who has the words ?
Can anyone confirm. I have ordered a ledger Nano S regardless but just wanted to be sure. As i have all my currency held in coinbase and not looking to sell anytime soon, and my spending is quite small.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:22:00
This is a brilliant idea !!!!
