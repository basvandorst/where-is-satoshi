I've seen quite a few of them

Also I'm with 3 UK banks, they all do it. This is a perfect example of why we need bitcoin. You think you're an expert because you travel "once or twice" a year..

No, google will ban any ad that has misleading URLs. it's happened to me before when I attempted to use google and had a spelling error in my URL.

Yeah I use it on fiverr frequently.

I tried this with like 25 cents and it took 3 weeks to arrive. is there any way to refresh your wallet?

sharedcoin thru blockchain.info?

You spelt statement wrong on your mission page.
"Mission Statment"

And all those people who've gone over the code with great attention to detail just missed it completely?

Can you think of any reasons thye nearly always transact 13.88 bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:32:22
It's quicker and easier to *buy* bitcoins in nearly every country outside the US. However it's easiest to spend them in the US. Go figure...

edit: Glad to see other people beat me to it.

Googles own rules state that they will not allow adverts that do not show the correct URL, so how that got past their filter I don't know

If I put 1btc through sharedcoin I'm usually one of multiple people doing a transaction of exactly 1btc.
How would they possibly know who's is whos?

overstock still won't deliver to many countries even if you use bitcoin so there's clearly no fraud risk to them.
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:05:41
why would it be a concern to me
@_date: 2014-06-18 05:41:50
Yeah, but it works most of the time...i.e everytime until this one.
It's just annoying.

Last time I used it it was for a 1btc transaction, and like 3 other people put exactly 1btc through at the  same time. The simplest solution is to always do round numbers I guess. 0.25 .5 or 1btc. If you launder 1.3872 bitcoins its gonna be pretty obvious when that minus the fee comes out the other side.

The visa exchange rate is usually pretty good, if the banks weren't always giving me grief I'd never bother with actual currency exchanges as they rarely are any better. Only exception being over £5000 or so when you buy it online and they deliver it the next day, but I forget what that service is called.

That doesn't matter, the website that it pointed to was not blockchain.info so they wouldn't allow it to display the blockchain.info link. They must have gotten some advert manually approved and then changed just a small part of it to slip past the automated approval system. That's the only way I can think they'd have got it past google
