You're a moron if you think it's a bad idea to build on prior work.

Fuck Blockstream

The only thing that can be taken from that comment he linked is that they are rational software developers.

I'll be happy to use LN when it actually works, until then, lets all shut about it?
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:11:04
Yeah!!1 Let's point our mining farms there, guys!!!

A bunch of reasons... but the main on being that it introduces a lot of complexity into the protocol just to solve transaction malleability. Now there is block "weight" and special discounted transactions...

steem has 3 second blocks and has the biggest market share of all cryptos by transaction volume, but bitcoin will never get that because then core's off-chain solution they spent many millions developing would be worthless
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:21:33
Why's that? They are already doing more transactions per second than Bitcoin, and some of those transactions are huge (entire blog posts)

It's not less secure.

Their project goals may be different, I don't know, but they both still function as peer-to-peer electronic cash system :)

Well if you believe in the tech go and buy some now. If you're right you can make a boatload of cash.
I personally believe SegWit is a piece of garbage and it being activated is the beginning of the end for Bitcoin (core)
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:40:45
You may have to accept higher fees until November when bcore becomes an altcoin and 2x activates.

I need an arrow to "You're a moron" leading from that bubble...

This "FUDSPAM" could just as easily have been Blockstream to push their "scaling solution".

Throwing spike-mats on the highway does not cause crashes. Only drivers not stopping will cause crashes.

I suggest anyone unsure about the miners role in the network to educate themselves by reading the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](
And then have a look at [this thread]( where the blocksize limit was discussed.

Hey UASF ~~crazies~~ supporters, you should go bet on it activating! You can get some really sweet odds! Triple your money and get SegWit activated at the same time, WIN-WIN-WIN!

Ignore these insane UASF circlejerkers, here's the real stats:  
I think 50% will be a tipping point and we will finally get the blocksize increased. Better late than never right?
