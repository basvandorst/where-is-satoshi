Utter bullshit.  A bald faced lie about the joys of buying bitcoin.  No BTC exchange in Argentina means the writer prefers to send his personal ID to another country, to people who can`t even secure bitcoins and expect his information to be kept secure.  [all in an effort to avoid his legal and moral obligation to pay his fair share]

April 2013 I was googling "steal electronic money from internet nerds"  .  The second result was an article about the Winkelvos twins --   (they have made about 50mil in 1 year.)

The most shocking thing is how few people at this conference look like people in the "money" business.  A convention of bankers/realtors/insurance people look a certain way... these people look like... potheads.

The real anger you see is the acknowledgement that corporations are about to take over bitcoin.  The IRS ruling makes sense in this context.

This is great- imagine the taxes the miners/mining pools will have to pay.

6300 ars/btc. And .13 ars:usd = 819USD/btc?  You must be joking.

You mean the vast majority in the world.

(US gov't must dump all the seized silkroad bitcoins before Oct 1 2014, crashing every market.)

IRS sub ruling in the article: Bitcoin miners would have to report their earnings as taxable income with a value equal to the worth on the day it was mined. If they mine as part of a business, they would have to pay payroll taxes as well.

suddenly the very public blockchain isn't such a great asset.  I love that miners have to pay taxes.

You seem to believe that exchanges are charities.  They are organized frauds.  Every bitcoin exchange took their FAQ from a nigerian chain letter.
