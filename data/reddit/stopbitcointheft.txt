Hey, thanks for linking this for me.  Let's just hope Coinbase makes some improvements.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:51:05
I'm sorry to hear about your e-bay story as well. Until there are better ways to track crimes on the internet we all have to be so careful about these phishing attacks. I use Gmail as well but this phishing attack slipped in through a fake google search bar on my browser google chrome. I thought it was real, typed in coinbase and their page came up coinbase.us. It's unfortunate for me, but I hope I can help increase awareness for others. Thank you for your support.

Thank you for the support. The website has been taken down thank goodness. It was Coinbase.us. I was directed to it through a google search bar that I discovered to be fake afterwards.  I see that always typing the web address yourself is definitely one way to be safer. I hope Coinbase also implements some of my security concerns also for the sake of their customers.

Good strategy, the internet is very dangerous
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:56:55
I think that losing customers to Bitcoin theft is worse. Security won't lose customers in my opinion, I think that would be a feature that would increase customers if anything. Nobody wants to invest in a company that is just being formed with lack security measures

I want people to be aware of these loop holes, with such a new company their is bound to be mistakes but I think it is so important to hold them responsible for protecting their customers. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:45:47
I appreciate the support. I hope the helps increase some safety for everyone.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:42:37
I think this would be a great safety feature also
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:50:47
I agree that this would be a great safety "optional" feature.  I think that there is nothing bad about having more safety. A few people have been counter arguing that it would limit users but if the safety features were optional I see no harm whatsoever. If you don't like the features you don't have to use them.

Where were you able to find the Coinbase chat? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:27:19
Sorry not purposefully, it was coinbase.us I have reported the scam site federally as well as to Coinbase. Yesterday the page was taken down thankfully.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:00:13
It was a mistake on my part. Typing it into a search engine to bring up the website instead of manually typing the URL
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:27:18
Good information to know, thank you for sharing
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:34:07
That should be required, I don't know why the phisher was able to do this without some kind of hold being placed on the account. Seems completely unreasonable. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:06:19
Thank you!! Doing that right away. My goal in this is to help other's if possible. I know it's too late for me but I don't want anyone else to have to suffer like I have for not knowing.
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:46:55
I had just received them and they were going to be transferred soon. Hindsight, not a good reason. It's a lot of money to me too. Big bummer 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:08:30
I appreciate the support. Thank you
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:35:26
I'm glad I could help. Thank you for the support
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:02:07
I was not pleased with their response, a very generic e-mail over a day later. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:52:31
It is extremely easy to steal digital money. All Bitcoin dealers are aware of this including coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:29:31
Hey, I'm that user you were referring to. Thanks for stepping up for me. It really sucks how little was done to ensure the security of my account. I feel that coinbase could have taken stronger preventative measures, they also could have been better with their response and solutions. The matter feels unresolved and this has been a significant financial setback for me. I just hope they can [make these changes]( as it will surely happen again to someone else. If they want to be market themselves as a large and safe business this shouldn't have been an issue for me.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:55:18
The website came up when I googled it from what I thought was a legitimate searching tool
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:57:49
Good consideration for extra protection.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:08:01
I keep looking but maybe I am just missing their opperating hours. It's good to know that is there, even if I have never been able to use it. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:14:27
I agree they are a good company but still young and growing. I hope they make the appropriate changes to better support their customers protection. In my opinion that is number one priority 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:45:09
See edited post for info. It was a false URL that I was directed to from a fake search bar
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:51:54
I'm the first user on your list.  After having thousands of dollars stolen it is unpleasant to be accused of making up a significant financial setback during an already difficult time in my life.  I'm also not out to headhunt Coinbase as you say, I've said positive things about them, but I still feel there are unaddressed issues here.
I've shared [my story](
) with compelling questions and no one has had a good response to them.  Specifically,
there currently isn't a great multi-signature option or a 2fA that lets you know whether the request is for login, account changes, or withdrawal. However, there could be an option for email verification to withdraw funds. 
When the attack occurred, I believed I was logging into the legitimate site. Well, it was a fake site and it compromised the login and the 2FA.  An option for Email withdrawal verification would have prevented any phishing attack of this nature. The user would have to verify the withdraw from a completely different account/login screen.  Limiting foreign IP addresses is another optional feature that could be offered. Even if Coinbase doesn't feel this is a a feature they want to provide it should have at least raised one of many red flags in their system.
  I reported the fake site to Coinbase and the site has been removed.  Most likely Coinbase contacted the domain host and had it taken down.  Good on them.  What sucked was when I was first attacked it took 24 hours before they responded to my emails. The attack occurred during normal business hours of operation in the US.
To conclude, these are legitimate problems.  Coinbase has not offered solutions that can prevent funds from leaving a users account without permission. They are also very slow and difficult to reach when there is a problem.
[Here is a screenshot]( I took a week ago from my account of the theft in question.  It is the best proof I'm willing to share without revealing my own privacy.  The attacker's German IP used was 46.165.211.195
  And yes, this is a throwaway account. I don't want to tie this private matter to my regular account- might I ask why you are using a throwaway?
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:44:12
Thank you for the support and the advice . I added how I came across the site to the original post because I was getting asked that alot.
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:57:41
I watched the third party steal through the real coinbase site while there was nothing that I could do to stop it. No safety features that allowed me to protect myself even within the first minuet of it happening. No customer  service contact until a day later. Yes third party is the bad guy here, but nobody cares about catching the bad guy or doing anything to protect future customers from future bad guys and that if frustrating. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:00:09
So by your standards the coinbase sight is not safe and everyone who has purchases there is asking to be stolen from?
