you should have used a paper wallet and an actual safe :D

You do have to have a  EUR/USD Wallet on Coinbase but it doesn't need to have money on it in the beginning.
I'll add the percentage for prices soon, for now you can only use hard values
You can fake a buy for the bot easily:
1. In your config.inc.php file set "SIMULATE" to true and save
2. Start the trader bot and tell it to buy some btc with the buy command
3. Set simulate to false again and save
Then your bot will think it has bought the amount you set in step 2 and can sell it later
It will not re-buy or re-do a transaction

it should work with CAD if you set it up in the config.inc.php if coinbase supports CAD. Please let me know but in theory it should work

I started end 2015 and bought a 1000€ pc (mainboard + ram + cpu) with my earnings and still got a few hundred bucks left in BTC.
The only "problem" with this is obviously that you need large investments and a lot of time for this to pay out well. Otherwise you will only earn small amounts which will be even less after fees

no but I was able to buy a 1000€ computer with this method and still got a few hundred bucks left. Did it by hand until now

Oh I see, that sucks! For the same reason I hate Stripe (payment system) they allow you to use multiple payment methods but in Austria where I live they only support credit card which makes them rather useless.
Didn't look into kraken yet but I'll check if the API is easily adaptable

yep, that's a good takeaway from my story :)

I'm so humbled that BBC picked up my story. If anyone wants more details, here is my original blog post:

I didn't mention it in the blog post but I had tracked him much more than that. I was scanning old leaks from big sites and found multiple profiles of him. Some connected by his IP, some for using the same passwords on all sites.
