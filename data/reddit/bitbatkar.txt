I feel like there's no way a significant portion of fiat-users won't get screwed in such a transition, like &gt;25% at least. That makes it hard for me to believe that people will willingly opt into crypto beyond a certain point, i.e. we'll have parallel economies at best.

But you'd be poor in the crypto world for all the money you had. This problem comes up long before you're the last person, and at a certain point it seems those who are still stuck in fiat will just stay there since the price of admission to crypto will be too high. I don't think there's a way to transition beyond crypto being a parallel economy to it being the dominant one without inviting at least some of the problems of fiat (such as governing agencies) into it. Doesn't mean there's not, or that having a parallel economy isn't already a great feat, I just don't see how that transition could occur. Maybe epic-scale FOMO making everyone just placing market orders for whatever their fiat will get them.

I could definitely see economies becoming crypto-based over paper/digital money as we know it now. I meant crypto as "everything not state-run AKA fiat 2.0". I think the generic issue I outlined above stands whether or not government money becomes crypto-based. That's an interesting idea to have varying inflationary rates for government issued money though. It'd probably work out to a couple percent difference and be the new way bonds and such work.

Where does your employer get bitcoins with which to pay you?
