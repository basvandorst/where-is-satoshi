So now you have two wallets with the same bitcoins in them ?

subscribe  (is 9 letters long)
@_date: 2016-04-15 10:51:42
Because it's a long 'o', which is more typically spelt with two.
Roomba, Bamboo, blooper, and &lt;grin&gt; loose.

I've watched The West Wing. I know exactly what the deputy press secretary's job is, and would not believe a thing she says.

Is that the best argument you can come up with ? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 10:55:09
And for the layman, bitcoins are "IT guy" things too. The *last* thing "IT guys" need is more badly defined words that their customers are going to be using willy nilly.
For goodness sakes, use a word that doesn't already have a strong established meaning in a related field
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:05:37
Since you're being a bit(*) more polite now, I'll respond appropriately. The multiple existing meanings of the word bit, as listed on the freedictionary page you linked to, refer to meanings in the area of acting, time, tools, horses, pieces, and of course the basic unit of computer storage.  Also refers to money, in terms of two bits being equivalent to a quarter dollar. 
Bitcoins, to the lay person, are either a computer thing, or an internet thing, and they're so well unknown to most at the moment, that I really do think that the difference in meaning of the word bit, as in the existing computer/internet related usage, and the word bit to refer "computer money" or "internet money", is a very fine distinction that will be missed on a lot of people. Not just, as you  suggest, people who are easily confused, or are below average intelligence.  That's just insulting to half the population of the world (who are, by definition, below the average intelligence)
And don't forget that many many people are already confused by anything to do with computers or the internet. Adding another potential source of confusion, which could be easily avoided at this point, helps nobody.

So, you really have no argument, other than insulting people who disagree with you.

You're is an abbreviation for 'You are', right ? So.. .it's you are ... youare.. you're ..  there's still a change in position of the speaker's jaw from the 'you' position to the 'are' position, at the apostrophe.
With 'Your', there's no such movement. It's a single syllable that sounds like "yaw", but not like "you're"
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:18:50
Because it's the wrong word, it makes it harder to read, and it's not even the same sound as the correct word

yeah...... so what software do I install to detect if my computer is being bugged by Amnesty International ?
@_date: 2014-09-01 10:52:10
Sa-toe-she, with emphasis on the second syllable
'to' as in 'Tokyo'

Making a grammar mistake (missing comma, and it's "it's", not "its") when correcting someone else on their grammar can be embarrassing
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:46:50
Agreed. Crazy idea. The word "Bits" is also used to refer to throughput in networking, commonly used to refer to the platform an operating system runs on, used in cryptography, colour depth  (32 bit), and I'm sure in many  other places too. It's certainly not an "IT guy" vs every one else scenario.

And in tomorrow news - the Guardian reveals the shocking discovery that water is wet.
This is not news. It's not even an article. It's someone complaining that the blindingly obvious happened to them, and they're raging to the media to compensate for feeling stupid about not expecting that.
Obviously in this day and age, a bank's branches do not carry, in cash, the entire balance of everyone's bank accounts. A bank operates by investing the funds that people store with it, and then returning some of the gains made as interest earned, and using the rest to contribute towards the costs of running the bank. The rest of the costs are recovered by charging fees.
It is ridiculous to think that if you have 12K in your account, that you should be able to walk up with no prior warning, and walk out with 12K in large denomination notes.  Nobody uses cash any more. He could have had a cashier's cheque written for the full amount, or he could have given notice that he need a large sum in cash (in which case, questions would probably be asked, and the police notified as a matter of course)

In my experience, they aren't helpful at all. I live in NZ, and they weren't willing to accept a PDF of my power bill (it has the words 'online bill' watermarked on it) which is just insane in 2013.
And then I found out that the only way to get money to them is via western union or similar, which can take weeks.
So I went with localbitcoins instead and found someone who would do it via bank cash deposit.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:14:32
I feel for you.. I went through the same thing a month ago, when a BTC was only about $400.    Initially tried to sign up with mtgox, only to discover AFTER signing up that they don't accept payment by credit card.  That then led me to do some research on that subject, and I realised that since bitcoins can't be revoked, any form of payment that can be reversed creates a gaping hole for abuse/fraud, which is clearly why they don't accept these things.
And after sending mygox my scanned utility bill and other supporting documents, they rejected me on the basis that the bill didn't list my physical address.. in fact it did, it was just on the side bar of the PDF, and they hadn't bothered to look there. I pointed that out, and they said nope, won't accept it, so I said well, I can't use your service anyway, so you may as well just delete the account, and then they got all apologetic and tried to convince me to use them.. for what.. how ?  totally impracticable - I would have to do a western union transfer or something like that, pay all the fees involved, and still not get the BTC for days afterwards.
So I found someone on localbitcoins that would accept a bank deposit in my country, and even that wasn't without problems..  
So yes, been there, done that, I now own 0.997 bitcoins, or something like that, which are now worth more than twice .. maybe 3 times, what I paid for them, and now I'm stuck wondering if I should spend even more money to get more or not.
