It's important to remember that most fiat is also digital.  For example, only 3% or so of US dollars are printed.  Ironically, and AFAIK, those are the only government issued dollars, the rest are issued by the Fed.

This is the best talk I have seen on bitcoin.  Awesome.It's also nice that Andreas addressed the whole 51% / GHash thing.  Thanks for recording/uplaoding.

There are huge businesses (i.e. central banks) that are fundamentally motivated by money and who see Cryptos as a threat.  Them sacrificing a few hundred million, even billion makes sense to save their multi-trillion dollar businesses makes total sense.

OK, so full-on theft of coins from existing wallets into other wallets would be possible, even for old transactions.  Bad deal.

I think this organisation deserves some attention under the eye of 'Ponerology' (the study of evil).  Polish psychiatrist Andrzej Łobaczewski believes that we the masses need to figure out ways to protect ourselves from these and other slime that hold abusive power over us / the planet.

The problem is the parasitic nature of our current financial system.  It is based on getting something for nothing...in other words interest/usury and money printing/inflation.  This something for nothing model has to go.  The middle class is being destroyed.  More people are living in desperate/futile struggle and the elite money monger power abusers are consolidating wealth/power more and more.  We the masses have to protect ourselves from them.

Good, let them 'investigate'...and let them miss out.

They could easily be bought out behind the scenes by those for whom this kind of money is absolute peanuts and for whom it makes sense to sacrifice this money in order to save their real business (i.e. parasitic fiat debt money usury interest, etc., which is worth trillions, even hundreds of trillions if you consider the derivatives bubble stands at over a quadrillion.  These hardware costs are nothing at this point for them, but the threat of cryptocurrencies is very real to them.

OK, so if an attack happened at even say 80%, although there would very likely be a price drop/collapse, the coins that exist can't just be disappeared out of the ledger / ones wallet.
One could continue to hold and hope for a solution and subsequent price recovery.
Good to know.

Ripple is a scam central banker coin.  It's not a crypto-currency.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:05:49
Yes, I agree with Andreas...Ripple has loads of problems relative to legitimate cryptos.

How does a crypto being backed by a fiat make it MORE stable?  The whole reason cryptos are increasing in value is due to global flight from parasitic fiat.

This is a fantastic discussion that discusses both the strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin.
