I feel this article wants to put some blame on user but shoves it completely onto Kraken. They did a good job writting it, still user fucked up and not just the one time like they stated. 
I believe Kraken should be held accountable to some level but not to say it's their fault user lost 43k. 
Seriously, who puts 43k on an exchange in hopes to get rich without 2fa on literally anything, not even your Email? At that point, user fucked up every day since creation of his Email. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:02:28
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:19:55
No you missed the mark. You needed funds in Kraken account before the fork to be credited on Kraken. Now it's too late. 
You can still import to a wallet I believe.

What if it doesn't?  What if it falls and dude panics and sells at a loss with negative views about Bitcoin because of your shit advice?

Use Dollar Cost Averaging. Or dollar averaging cost... Or whatever the order is.
Basically buy a few now, a few later, and a few after that. So if the price does fall after you buy it, you can still have cheaper coins. If it goes up atleast you got a few in while you could. 
Just avoid tether.

The great thing about bitcoin is that it doesn't just work off a whole number. You say not everyone would have a stake in bitcoin, that's not true. Down to the 0.00000001 satoshi, bitcoin works just as it does for 1. The fact that some people hold large amounts of coin doesn't matter because it doesn't effect the actual product of bitcoin, albiet might be able to move the market a bit, but not really. 
There are problems when you use fiat and use statements like 'everyone should have a stake in the currency'. When dealing with dollars that is just printed up as needed, it's creating an inflation. Yes you can use pennies but that doesn't work the same as 0.00000001 satoshi, especially with finite number, you'll always have a deflation. 
When bitcoin is worth over 50k, it'll be easier to see the currency side of bitcoin when you transact in 5000 satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:00:14
These posts just don't stop do they? The people who asked at 1k 2k and 3k are all at a profit. And if you're referring to the recent drop,  it's only down 15% and eagerly waiting for a bounce. If it went to 6-7-8k would you care?

Tether is claimed to be pegged to US dollar and is used to prevent going back to fiat for tax reasons. However tether states they will not buy any tether back, which leaves exchange trading for it. 
If you're buying bitcoin for investment, you should not have to worry about exchanging it ever for something, and when you do sell out you should just buy back into fiat and pay taxes. If you want to trade it's better to use btc as base currency and trade alts against it. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:49:31
It makes complete sense. The buyer can just open a chargeback. You now lost your btc. Don't use PayPal.

Feelings aren't what great decisions are made of. Unless you have some technical analyses going you should stop that. 
To prevent spending too much you can buy some now, and if it goes down you can buy a little more. Alternatively though, if it goes up then that average gets a little higher.

First you won't be making 100k a month. Second I'm going to stop you right now and say that if you're here asking about trading cryptos, don't trade cryptos. You will lose money. 
The best strategy I can give to someone who hasn't even purchased crypto yet is to purchase it, and just hodl it. Unless you are actually a seasoned trader and know what you're doing I don't recommend doing it. 
This isn't a get rich quick scheme. These are investments, some into your financial future, some into the tech that we all believe will run the world one day. If you don't know why Bitcoin is here you have even more research to do. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:17:39
Ages huh? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:56:15
It's called investments for a reason. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:45:32
Aye I tell people if they have too much doubt to not even worry investing. Because after that point, and when your first dip happens you will most likely panic and let emotions control your decisions. 
Only invest what you are willing to lose. If you don't want to lose 3k, only put in half. Profit comes from risks and we're playing the riskiest. If I were you dude I would put all that in. 
That's just me though. I'll see you when we hit the moon.

The fact that you're calling Xrp 'ripple'.  As far as I'm concerned until ripple requires banks to use xrp, they are separate entities leaving xrp with nowhere to go. And the centralization... Horrible.

Plot twist! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:00:05
You need to start looking at your bitcoins as the decimals they are in rather than their worth against fiat. 
How many coins did you recieve from said vendor? If you took 150$÷(Whatever price you bought at) does it = your amount of coins? 
If not then yes, vendor ripped you off. If yes, then it's just because the price fell and we all need to wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:19:29
What wallet? Because that's clearly not the case with most transaction processing so you're probably starting off buying and dealing with the wrong sites and apps. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:45:31

Thanks to atomic swap, litecoin will be my every day use, which will be just as adopted as bitcoin.

I can't believe that would have worked. That's some old runescape armor trimming shit.
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:53:46
I did about a months research before buying my first coin. You should learn and understand where bitcoin is headed and why the price is falling right now.
If you don't know what coinbase is you definitely need more research. 
But in the end, if you plan for long term investing any time is a decent time to buy.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:26:38
Yes that is a viable option, I am doing the same. However please keep in mind you are trusting your funds to an exchange which may or may not go down at any time.

If it's a wire transfer, the time on those can always be quite long. ACH goes through quickly, which is why I don't know why kraken doesn't support that.
This is the only thing I could find about wire limits if it helps you.
"You will not be able to submit a withdrawal if it puts you over your current daily/monthly limit. The daily withdrawal limit works as a 24 hour sliding window. So all of the withdrawals from the past 24 hours are taken into account when calculating the limit. Monthly limits are based on a 30 day window.
If a withdrawal fails due to being over limit, you must either make a withdrawal that does not exceed your current limit, or wait until a previous withdrawal expires from the sliding window period.
You can check your current withdrawal limit under Funding &gt; Withdraw &gt; (Currency) &gt; "Maximum withdrawal".
Withdrawal limits are a required part of our regulatory compliance measures. "

You should educate yourself on why btc is at the price it is and future events pertaining to btc. McAfee isn't wrong, Btc will definitely go up. I doubt 500k but to say btc won't have growth from here is nieve.

At the time of the split, whatever btc you hold in a wallet is how much bcc you can claim in a bcc wallet. If you do not hold any btc at the time of split you cannot claim bcc.
If you do not hold your private key or never import the key into a bcc wallet then those bcc will be unclaimed.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:42:21

r/litecoin won't take the shit r/Btc tends to come up with.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:42:55
Any exchange or wallet supporting the fork will only give you 1 Bcc for every 1 Xbt you have. No extra Xbt will be given out, since that has to come from somewhere and the exchanges probably don't want to give out free Xbt like that.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:45:57

If the amount of bitcoin you received is the same as what you paid for then the 10% might be the websites fees for using them, on top of network fees which should lower. Try looking up the websites fee policy, they should have one.
If it's not that then the loss in price is because btc/usd fell. Which is okay, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:10:04
Bitcoin Cash Bcc is the coin of BitcoinABC.
viaBTC is only allowing people the trade futures. Which means those users must trust viaBTC to freeze their Btc until Aug 1st, but they get to trade Bcc futures.

I especially enjoy the r/litecoin sub. A bunch of great people with a lot of knowledge and willing to share. Litecoincore.org shows the litecoin 2017 Roadmap which shows you future events. Definitely a good investment regardless of bitcoin finally getting Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:18:58
Bitcoin will fork meaning a new coin will be created, Bitcoin Cash(Bcc) the coin of BitcoinABC.
If you hold Bitcoin before August 1st in a wallet that you hold the private keys to, you will have access to Bcc. Certain Wallets like Coinbase have stated they will not support Bcc however.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:04:52
I definitely know how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:49:22
I was thinking buy Ltc on coinbase and using shapeshift in a wallet separate from coinbase. Other than that get verified on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:09:38
I've actually had really good experience with support tickets. Normally I got an email from them within 2 days and was solved fairly quickly. Unlike other exchanges where I've literally been waiting almost a month for a response.

If Btc forks, anyone holding Btc and their own private keys can have access to Bcc in the same value that you have in Btc. Unless you really believe Bcc can succeed, you can throw those coins up for trade and get Btc. Free money.

@_date: 2017-07-24 15:52:24
It might, it might not. My point being is that having btc before or after is irrelevant since btc will be fine and prosper. The only question is if you want BCC so you can sell it for free btc?? Right?

I would suggest in 3 sessions.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:09:09
Always a good time to buy if you believe in the tech and community. I highly suggest you take anything you see from reddit with a grain of salt. Do a lot of research into what you're buying and why. Is it just for money? Do you want to see btc in the future maybe alongside with litecoin or some other crypto that is changing the world's financial system?
Bitcoin could go to 0 just like that. But then again it probably won't. You know?
I would buy... but I gotta wait for the ol paycheck first. ��

Before fork you have 1 btc.
After fork you will have 1 btc and 1 bcc.
In order to receive the bcc though you need to import the private key of the wallet that holds the btc into a wallet that supports bcc.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:03:02
You have 1 btc before the fork. After the fork you have 1 btc and 1 bcc. The bcc was given to you thanks to the fork. Sell after.
