This is the type of integration that connects with average jo's like me. A familar use with benefits is what the mainstream is looking for. I think more of this type of slick conversion will help drive adoption, pity its not in the UK yet.

Yes I agree, that's why they should be made to run with enough reserves so they can fail without bringing down the whole system and economy with them. If nothing changes next time there will probably be no bailout money for them and your prediction will come true.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:57:43
Now you know why they split :D
@_date: 2015-12-04 11:59:30
Hope this is just the beginning, the purse strings need to be cut.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:14:14
Good article with sound reasoning IMO.
@_date: 2015-12-04 12:50:01
Agree, should have never been the case we bail banks.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:31:01
Sounds great, if it could happen next year that would work great for me, many thanks ;-)

Been thinking this myself, especially with micro-payments. Guess they are just watching and waiting to see what works, then just buy the company and integrate it into their existing services. I also reckon they feel crypto is still too much on the dark side for their liking.
@_date: 2015-12-02 11:44:38
I need at least 250K a coin, so I predict that. Don't ever remind me...
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:56:03
Competition has to be fair for that to work, which it is not - if you believe otherwise you are misguided. People are not fair and life is not fair, hence the need for governance, the rule of law and in the beginning the Magna Carta, to try and redress that balance. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:48:15
Sorry but it is a well documented fact, and your theory of a conspiracy for more power is just that in this case. If you have documented proof that was the case please share.
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:11:41
True. I agree, and that's another can of worms....
@_date: 2015-12-09 10:36:12
Fuck, LOL, every time I see this :D
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:13:23
Well at least they are validating the blockchain's integrity, that has to be a plus for Bitcoin in the long term, especially when people understand they have a real choice and can do what the banks can do for a lot less.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:09:15
Chances are if you could live for a 1000 years, you would still meet your end a lot sooner through misfortune.

I think you will find that the precursor to the [Welfare State]( was WW2, when the establishment, for once, felt truly indebted to the working man for saving the free world from tyranny.
Why the down votes on a fact?
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:19:34
I agree, but the big boys getting on board is a great start. I think mobile and console payments are where crypto can be strong and will succeed.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:02:08
The internet of money, sounds like an idea ;)
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:13:57
Lets hope they all drop their guard over the blockchain, then the real deal can flourish.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:06:39
No 6 is the way forward IMO.

Why have more than one type of car, computer, cereal, shirt, social network or fish?
@_date: 2016-01-13 09:44:24
If it happens, people will resort to other forms of non-traceable exchanges of value when needed. Trading is older than cash.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:49:40
Too true unfortunately, Bitcoin will be no different, but it may open up some more opportunity for others along the way.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:18:39
Thought Santander was one of the blockchain friendly banks, seeing as they are developing on it themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:47:48
Thanks for taking the time to explain this. My knowledge is pretty basic on this, and can get tied up pretty quick trying to follow these processes through, however my feelings are that bitcoin is starting to wobble with all the uncertainty and infighting that is going on at present. Confidence in a currency is all important, that much I am sure of.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:03:38
I have thought this too for a while -on demand at a granular level: 1 song play, 1 episode, 1 series, 1 movie, 1 channel and/ or 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. Might be more suitable for mobile users.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:16:17
Imagine being able to watch just 1 show/ episode, on demand, on your mobile with no signup.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:21:37
Fidor, thanks for that :-)
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:36:34
Is that Google ads, or something more like ad choices? I do get the same issue with ad choices following my searches, even though you unsubscribe it just keeps coming back. Reminds me I need to sort an ad blocker :D
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:13:00
Googles ads are not really intrusive in their search results, and are easily ignored as far as I'm concerned. Sorry mate, but think you are barking up the wrong tree on this one.
@_date: 2016-01-23 10:40:10
Fair comment, uncertainty doesn't help IMO either.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:10:50
Any excuse!
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:30:52
Thanks, that's what I thought, but as I'm not that technical I wasn't completely sure.

I have read that to, however I believe he has dipped his toe in IBM after hearing how good their customer retention is supposed to be.

People have short memories bob.

They knew what Greece was about before lending to them in the first place. More bad judgement from bankers.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:40:30
I agree with your sentiment that there are a few at the top who are opportunistic vultures with no scruples, but being able to orchestrate such a convoluted plan seems a little far fetched. They would never risk their own position on such a long bet. That said if it does play out as you describe, I'm sure they will happily shaft everyone along the way to ensure they get a profit, and still sleep like babies at night.
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:37:20
Isn't the situation more about choice, you can have a centralised option within the decentralised system? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:51:36
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:32:30
Well, I can't say I know the truth of the situation, but the bankers do hold all the cards, which is why IMO they can make poor decisions based on short term gains. So I guess we are both saying that they control the narrative really when it comes down to it.
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:49:44
Been using Coinomi for a few months now and have to agree. Ease of use on multiple coins plus Shape Shift integration makes for a useful wallet IMO. Hope it can produce more great features in the future.

To be fair governments and federal institutions are all reliant on big money players to make things happen, they are the one true constant, politicians are just passing through.
@_date: 2016-02-03 09:34:03
Worryingly this line of thinking seems to be gaining traction with more and more countries. Blanket policies for all to stop a few, pity they weren't so forthright with big business and their questionable affairs.

Not just Millennial's, previous gens also been fucked over by their peers.

Love stuff like this.

Ironically they may also enhance the validation of bitcoin's blockchain in the end.
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:48:17
Yeah, straight to the nub of it, unlike my attempt.
@_date: 2015-11-27 11:39:08
You may be correct for some but not all. Plenty of people understand and are pissed off with the banks, the problem is it's systemic and people don't feel they have any credible options. Many would happily give the banks two fingers if they thought they could, and maybe one day they can.
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:37:12
Lost out a little myself, so understand, but the old adage of "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose" is still the best advice. It's a long game at best for us mortals with a big chance of bombing out to 0. Just make sure you're in a position to enjoy the ride whatever the outcome.
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:37:55
There gonna blame sunglasses next, because they cover your eyes and help you see better in bright sunlight. Truth it's just the usual knee jerk response from politicians trying to look as though they are doing something positive, but ultimately ineffective.

Gay porn is a better choice from what I've heard.

Great idea. A card game app on the same lines is something I have thought about before, just between you and your friends.
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:13:33
Banks need the competition from fintech to straighten them out, to push them to provide value and service to society while making a living. Banks won't disappear because plenty of people are happy with them, and that's good because it's all about real alternatives and choice. It also won't solve the issues of greed that are inherent in financial services, but it might just help make things more transparent and fairer for more of us. Here's hoping anyway....
@_date: 2015-11-22 17:29:22
I'd like to see it go further with integration of your social media and contacts, and then also the option to cash out for gift cards or phone credit. I'm probably being unrealistic at this stage, but I think this is where we need to be to get mass appeal. Just my 2 bits.
@_date: 2015-11-13 17:42:24
If small amounts are used and kept in the browser, say under £10.00, then it should allow for things to developed while minimising risk, a bit like contactless card payments now. I hope this happens soon.

Donald Trump?
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:40:17
I agree, transparency and trust through identity need to be an option at least.
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:22:46
Yep! too true. Another (older tech) analogy would be Betamax vs VHS video cassettes.
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:52:36
Sounds like the most plausible answer to me.

Ooooh! those wretched altcoin thingies....it will take me the rest of the week to undo my panties now :-(. Just goes to show people like centralised thinking even if they like the idea of decentralisation, I think??

I printed a paper wallet as a pdf (offline of course) then stored it on a key. I then printed a couple of copies and laminated them.
