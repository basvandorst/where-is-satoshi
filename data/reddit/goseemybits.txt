We don't make people wait for one conf. We accept and take many things into consideration when accepting the transaction into our system. If it fails those checks then we wait for 1 conf.

 currently largest Bitcoin. Only cam site for adults. We been around for 6months.

We are doing something similar! Check us out when we launch and follow us on twitter [

We use the actual Bitcoin core daemon, and the last step is converting to fiat currency. This allows us to do more trust less things ;)

Partnerships can be sharing of code, doesn't have to do anything with doing it for them. I don't want to handle their money. I don't want to handle any money. I just want to teach how more powerful Bitcoin is than just a payment system. That is all we want to do. Payment system for Bitcoin is for the lazy!

Using your logic with the V-block engine, it would be more like, hey I can use the building blocks of a V-block engine to move my car company ahead of everyone's company. Agreed only a few will do it but those will be the visionaries. But at some point it will be the standard and every car company will be doing it. Same can be said for bitcoins, it will be the standard of payments for the internet in a few years, then people will see it and use it to gain ahead of their competition. 
We are talking about using bitcoin beyond just showing address and accepting payments. Payment processors in a few years will be used daily not for every payment, when the price is a be more stable.

Thank you for the changetip! Plus the adult industry doesn't understand bitcoins and thinks it is some magic internet money that is too complex for them to understand. That is why we built this and trying to take that complexity out of it.

We have a good standing with google and other sites that report on that stuff. Make sure you see the green lock. Then you will know you are on our site :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:29:43
To be honest, more wallets need to implement the payment channel or impulse.is protocol so we can do it in a decentralized way and blockchain secure.
We have the framework for it and ready to launch it.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:08:20
No she reach the goal :) The next goal is already set if you want to see it again.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:59:18
Can't because of regulations, we would have to put up over $150K and that is just for the USA. We are looking into making that happen better with 3rd parties and make it easier to get cash from bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:13:50
well tip her and get her to do things ;) Is here to please :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:05:46
Trust me, the things we can do with bitcoins are game changing in this area. This is just a proof of concept to see if people are willing to get bitcoins and tip. Plus we only launched last friday so we are working hard to get everything where we need it to be.
Problem is more of the adult industry not accepting it, that where the community can help us the most!
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:37:40
We support this but using a payment processor is not the correct way. It doesn't show how bitcoins can solve many issues in the adult community. This is lazy and only benefits them in charge backs.
We will be reaching out for a partnership and show them how Bitcoin can make their business model and relationship with the models stronger.

If I can inject, yes flash gets a horrible rap for security flaws, but to be honest if you keep your flash up to date and you use trusted sites, you will never have trouble with those flaws. 
We as a cam site have developed a HTML 5 version of our site when we first started, the problem comes with doing private shows and gateways to videos. It is very difficult to do that in an html 5 player. Flash is the only way we could guarantee our models private shows are in fact private from non-paying customers. So why we don't think you will change your mind, there is good reason to use flash in this case. In 99% of the other time we be using html 5. It is the limitation of the software.

Largest Bitcoin cam site here 85+ cam girls... We have gotten personally 200 cam girls wallets and gave them some coins. No Bitcoin cam site holds enough traffic for them to make a living why leave $75k on the table for something that could pay off later. Cam girls have a huge turn overs so short terms goals are better than long term goals.
One of our models uses our site as her 401k she does it thinking that money made from it will not be spent and in the future she will have a good savings.
Shameless plug: [ from wallet to model ;)

Gratz! If you need any help let us know we like to help out in anyway!
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:41:27
How is this forking? We currently work with some of the other bitcoin cam sites on some cool things, so we not opposite to working with Xotika, but they clearly have slandered our name, also they have done no research in calling themselves the first bitcoin cam site, which isn't not true.
So yes the bitcoin cam sites don't liked people that just lie so easily like that.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:47:05
Yes he did!

Thank you for this information we have added them to our [wiki](
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:32:03
Can you send us a screenshot of what you are seeing? We can't find any pages vandalized. We just looked at all of them.

2 independents, we are the 1st or 2nd depending on how you counting. We usually teach models about bitcoin before allowing them on our site. They can't accept it if they don't know how to use it. We have been around for over 7 months [proof]( we have a decent amount of models. We don't hold user balances unless you use our user affiliate program. I don't know why our site doesn't get press it is probably cause we don't spam reddit all day. :)
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:10:12
Thank you for your opinion about our site, but we aren't focused on design we are focus on delivering privacy and best streaming experience using bitcoins. MFC is doing well with their site, so design has nothing to do with it.
We been around for over 6 months and currently by our research have the most verified models in our system. So actually that site is a replica of ours ;) we just don't attack them and don't spam our site, we actually go outside the bitcoin ecosystem to pull in users. 
Now on to the sites since you probably work for them... like the other guy that got banned so you probably are him.
Two factors go into a cam site... One is the ability for models to make money. Second is the impulse buy. Guess what no first time users to our sites will ever purchase bitcoins in seconds and be able to use them on our sites. You can integrate with an exchange, but goseemybit's tipping model doesn't allow that. We took the harder way... we don't hold customer balances, wallet to model.
So while you guys advertise you probably aren't going to get that many users from outside the bitcoin ecosystem, which will never be enough to even make a 1/10th of what cam models are used too. Even thou we don't have chargebacks, and less transaction fees.
We have been studying this a lot and have a lot of data to support this.
@_date: 2015-07-23 04:02:27
Look into [ we don't allow users to hold any balances on our site. Our solution is wallet to model :) You only tip what you want and rest stays safely with you :) We been around for over 7months and while we don't get much press cause we focus on teaching our models about bitcoin instead of spamming about our site. 
The only balance we hold for users is there affiliate link earnings. Sadly we have to do that way but that will probably change in the future.

Welcome and it is great to see more porn sites adopting bitcoins! 
We had the same moment and we hope to be bring it to the cam side of the industry!
Hopefully we can work together in the future to make sure more porn sites adopt bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:12:28
To get a money transmitter license if we wanted to do exchanging of bitcoins to USD for the models. Plus getting a bank to partner with us would extremely difficult being an adult site.
That is why we are only going to use bitcoin for the foreseeable future and integrate with 3rd parties that would make it easy to get local currencies for the models.

Actually most cam girls make better livings then the average american salary. Not only do these girls have to be great actresses but they have be equally good entrepreneurs. Not only marketing themselves but managing their time as well.
Just cause you are happy with a 9-5 job doesn't mean everyone is and these girls can better their lives by doing this, then shouldn't they be commend? If this was a poor person, that started a multi-million dollar company we would be giving them an award. Instead we attack them, and make them feel ashamed. We treat them like we need to help them or save them from their own decisions when in fact we should get in touch with our sexuality and realize it isn't much different from stating a company or brand.
Also isn't self-dignity different for each person? Shouldn't we respect each person's choice in what they consider their dignity? It is people like you that is running our government and feel good about making the moral decisions for other people. Isn't this why our country was founded in the first part because other people were making decisions for groups of people.
So just be the trolly troll you are and run along you have no clue what you are talking about.

Hi, I actually been speaking to many porn sites about why they don't accept bitcoins. There are really two main reasons, first one is that they would have to teach the models how to use bitcoins. That is one of our barriers as well being a cam site. The second is that teaching their demo how to use bitcoins. Most porn site's the demo is 35yrs-55yrs old not really the most tech friendly demo.
Some people in the porn industry have used bitcoin, they are mostly looking into putting it in the backend, to move money around, not really to accept it.
Also since I have people's attention, something that would help a lot is to get payment channels into wallets. That is something we have been heavy campaigning. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:03:53
This is amazing! Maybe we should work together or something! We are also in the porn industry. Welcome to the bitcoin club!

Why do you feel it is inappropriate? These girls are making a living like you and me. Why should they be subjected to "moral policing" from you or anyone?
It is actually a great place for newbies to learn, how to use bitcoins. By seeing something they like and training themselves to spend a $1 to show appreciation. It shows how easily and quickly bitcoin can be spent without asking for an email or private information. For too long appreciation has been showed thru clicking a like button, it is now time to use your money to support other people making a better tomorrow for themselves.
