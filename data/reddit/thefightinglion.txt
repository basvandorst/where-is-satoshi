The gold standard was effective until 1971 in the US, and 1973 by the IMF. That was "Traditional" since it had it's origins from the Bank of England in the 1690's and our current fiat system has been in place since the 70's.  I was not disagreeing with your point, just saying it was a misnomer since fiat in its current form has been around for less than 50 years, therefore is NOT traditional. You should spend more time reading and less time expressing your uneducated opinion.

Not a great idea. I'm with you on wanting to know the spendable amount, but I wouldn't worry about Satoshi's coins. If he/they are alive, they will want Bitcoin to succeed and would know moving those coins would cause chaos and have a negative effect on Bitcoin adoption.

You will get smart answers for both sides of the argument. I am a finance professional and have been for the past 14 years. There are a lot of unknowns in the Bitcoin world that makes predictions harder then in other markets with more coverage and publicly available numbers. We know the transaction volume, but some argue that a lot of what comes out of China is faked. Without knowing the real number of transactions, the amount of coins all major miners need to sell to cover costs, an accurate number of users, and not knowing the rate of user growth it's impossible to give you true insight. That being said, the most basic concept of supply and demand would suggest, assuming demand remains consistent, the price should appreciate.That doesn't mean it's going to the moon though, much of it may already be priced in. Hope this helps :)

A general rule of thumb is to allocate no more than 5% of your portfolio to speculative investment. Although, I personally believe that risk should vary on age (proximity to retirement) and wealth should also be factored e.g. A younger person or some one who has already reached their retirement goals can take on more risk.

It depends on how you see Bitcoin. If you see it as an investment 5% would be the logical amount if you consult any Certified Financial Planner. If you see Bitcoin as a useful currency with venders acceptance growing exponentially then that question would be like asking what percentage of your capital is in Dollars, Euros and Yen?... If you reach the 5% mark and don't feel entirely comfortable exchanging a larger chunk of capital for bitcoins I would recommend looking into the app lawnmower.

Hi, I have worked in finance for the past 13 years, successfully I might add. There are a ton of technical holes in your theory. That being said you are ignoring the fact that Bitcoin will half its mining reward in July, putting a supply constraint on the market. If you want to be good at finance, you need to look at everything not just a single technical theory.

I have worked in finance with equities for the past 13 years.  I can tell you that the halving in July will be bullish for Bitcoin. How bullish? No one knows. But a simple supply constraint (3600 coins mined a day to 1800 coins a day) will always push the price higher. Some will argue it's priced in, but they do not have enough market experience to realize most money is dumb money not smart money.

I believe eventually MSATs will be more relevant, just not yet (still too early). I have three Lightning Nodes (same team ;)). And yes larger purchases are in mBTC and that was established before Lightning existed (though not necessarily before theorized in 2015), however if you look at the vast majority of current stores and games you’ll notice that at this point in time the vast majority are priced in SATs. SATs is the most relevant. Go feed some chickens, you won’t be paying mBTC.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:31:09
Where is the proof that Coinbase is low on funds? They grow about 2000 users a day, even small purchases have fees. I think you're stating your opinion and not fact. Also, Gavin didn't want the limelight so he gave up his role... Seriously doubt this is an ego thing, he just disagrees with Core and doesn't want Bitcoin to die. Stop being a Core Nazi and let the miners and nodes vote for what they want by choosing it for themselves.

Gold worked for 2000 years and like Bitcoin is deflationary. The Fed convinced everyone using Keynesian economics that they could get rid of recessions. In 1971 we went off the gold standard, and had a recession two years later in 1973. We had a recession in the 1990’s and then the Great Recession in 2007/8. The truth is human behavior is cyclical, just like we have bear markets and bull markets we get recessions (on the gold standard or on fiat). The only difference is that on fiat the government secretly taxes your hard earned money so you spend more. But in truth you spend based on your personality and lifestyle, not due to inflation. Only now thanks to inflation people have less, and most don’t have enough to cover an emergency. Does that stop low income people from buying Nike’s or splurging on something they want. No. Deflationary money is not the problem, the lack of financial knowledge is.

It’s like this: Originally it was thought you could have a good space program using single engine rockets. But after years of testing, they realized that a functional space program would need rockets with detachable boosters. Well, Bitcoin has moved on from the single rocket vision realizing that you can still accomplish your mission by learning and moving forward with new technologies (e.g. Lightning Network), while B Cash is still holding on to old tech, because they are stuck on their principles, regardless of limits of the technology.

I recommend running your own Lightning Node. You can do so for cheap with the Raspibolt or RaspiBlitz projects, both on GitHub. If you’re looking for a more plug and play style then you can buy a Casa Node for $300, but they aren’t that customizable, unless you know how to edit the config file. You could also buy a Lighting in a Box for around $500, which is great if you have a store or LApp, and want to receive payments. If you’re looking to just play around with it there are a number of apps for Android and a couple for iPhone like BlueWallet. Hope this helps! :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:11:28

There is definitely a numismatic premium, especially if the hologram has never been peeled/redeemed.

Without an incentive, why would people mine? Bitcoin is the incentive that is needed for the Blockchain to work. It is possible to mine for another token, but there needs to be some incentive for miners, especially if you want a strong network.

I would like to see game apps that use Satoshi's for in app purchases, with the ability to purchase Satoshi's in game (like you'd purchase any other in game item). The games should also have the ability to send and receive bitcoins, like a wallet. This will help with adoption if the game is popular, like angry birds, since the game will also double as a wallet. Once you get people using bitcoin, even if it's within the confines of a game, they will see how simple and easy it is to use and will be able to see how they can use it easily for purchases outside of the game as well. A big problem with adoption is that, to the uninformed and non tech savvy, Bitcoin seems more difficult to use then it actually is. This would help make it more tangible for new users.

They are not more secure, I’m sorry you should educate yourself, before you make false claims based on lies.

Personally, I don’t look at investments the same way I look at gambling. If I gamble, I know how much I’m prepared to spend before I go and I consider my loses the cost of a few hours of entertainment. If I invest I spend hours doing research, think about my choices, my price targets and how much I’m willing to loose before taking a loss. I mean no offense, but be careful with your money. Choices involving your hard earned money should not be taken lightly. Also, be wary of gambling, it is an addiction to some. :)

Bitcoin is still in it's early stages as a currency, eventually the government will step in (like it or not) so that they can get their cut (IRS) and require the exchanges to issue 1099's. At that point I'm sure another branch of the government, probably a cyber crimes division, will investigate and prosecute theft. However, if statistically speaking it's as effect as current law enforcement many crimes will go unpunished. That being said, Bitcoin has had a lot of media attention and a lot of VC companies are investing millions into the space. I'm sure in the years to come we will see great advancements in both security and ease of use... Just be patient.
