I am following this sub for a reason.
I want reasonable and serious analysis, opinions and news about BTC but recently most posts I see is jerking the BTC off as if it is a god and will save the earth

So how is the system gonna fail ?
You should never forget that everything in this world is dictated by the big players, mostly banks not politics.
Do you think the Banks will let this happen thus getting their power taken from them ?

I don't think it's already time for them to do something since the BTC won't take over in the next decade or for even longer, the older generations of this world which trust in their currency needs to die first.
By then, maybe, BTC already died out to some sort of other krypto currency .
I am not saying krypto is bad, I also think krypto is the future of currency but it will take way more time to implement this form of currency into the whole society and world.
A currency is only strong if the majority supports, buys, sells and accepts it as their new trade good.
I see so many people in this /r saying 1 BTC will be worth ATLEAST 1 milion in the future but no one is actually talking about when this will happen and what it takes to change in the world for this to happen.
This will eventually happen in like 20-30 years, wow.
