Important read from a conversation with a core dev:

Yup, can see that now. My bad. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:18:22
I have to be honest, I did miss it a little. 
It's definitely better than the doom and gloom of late.

Not sure what instances you are referring to but bear in mind for them to facilitate exchange of currencies (USD/XBT) it may indeed not be legal without them gaining some sort of special licence. 
And if people do decide to try it may be in breach of their t&amp;cs.

You can call it 'The Bitcoin Cafe'

I'm curious about this too. In a month or so I'll be looking to buy a new studio flash set up and it would be great if I could do so with bitcoin.
I'll let you know if I manage to find anything, though I think at this stage we might struggle. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:09:40
Bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Perhaps I misinterpreted something but it was asking for my address for postage. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:57:12
I've never heard of them tbh, but anything that gives bitcoin a step towards legitimacy here is great in my books.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:26:11
Their money is trapped there so they're probably just trying to make the best of a bad situation. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:11:22
Everyone here is only thinking about those that are based in the USA.  Remember this is a global movement. 
I think companies such as Neo &amp; Bee stand a very good chance in the European market. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:41:53
But what if the bitcoins are hidden *inside* the puppy? 
I say get killing, you will probably find them before any one here does. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:10:00
I'm not sure why people were expecting them to announce withdrawals today, they never said they would. They knew people were expecting an update and so they provided one, and they did so quite effectively for a change. Now we know what the hold up has been and what we should expect when their *new system* is operational. 
Also to the extremist gox haters: if coins are worth less, their owners are less wealthy and therefore trade less value and pay less in fees. They will be wanting to see a recovery soon and will likely do their best to aid it. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:49:44
Couple of questions from someone not overly tech savvy (likely to not make much sense) 
Is it not possible to have the network automatically limit hashing power or whatever you would call it and effectively cap a pools growth? 
Alternatively is it not possible to record the bad transaction as it happens on the blockchain and then exclude anyone who gets caught red handed from the network? 
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:23:02

Dammit Gox, this is why we can't have nice things! 
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:29:04
It could pay to call it internet cash instead of money. I can already very easily send money using the internet, bitcoin is more like cash you keep with you and give to people directly without needing any other involvement.
@_date: 2014-01-31 09:44:49
They denied my first 3 tries over about 2 weeks from starting so I just spammed them with everything I could find with both my name and address on, I think about 8 or 9 in one email. They approved me 2 days later. 
This was about a month ago. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:02:05
You are presuming they have enough to pay everyone back. I would personally steer well clear of gox entirely. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:30:32
I've always used mtgox for no other reason than I already had an account. I've never really had any issues with them though after seeing this I can see the people who run it must really have no idea...
and I've just created a bitstamp account. Hopefully verification doesn't take too long, I suddenly feel an urgent need to get out of there. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:18:41
I do not trust online wallets for more than what I wouldn't be sad to loose. I am using cold storage atm but I'd like something that is easy to access at any time but not stored on the internet.

@_date: 2014-02-09 21:28:12
Thanks for the response, it appears I clicked the wrong button when I first got to your site and was being asked for my address, hence my confusion. 
It appears I have some reading up to do on all of this. Would you say that my laptop that I don't download silly things on and with updated antivirus software (Microsoft security essentials) would be adequately protected for such a process? Please bear in mind compared to many here I'm a bit of a tech noob. 
Thanks again.

How on earth are people supposed to stream movies without the internet?
Also not to mention I'm in a developed country with internet etc. but no sign of Netflix anywhere on the horizon ... 
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:03:33
I think it looks less like a scam than it did yesterday, and more like a legitimate business that hit a serious road block. I think we need to give it a few weeks to see if there are any significant steps being taken to amend the situation.
I personally am going to step back from the fud and come back in a week hoping for the best. And if you're right I'm gona have to give this whole bitcoin thing a miss. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:04:21
I'm not a complete noob, I have grown up on computers I've just never had any experience delving past the surface which some Bitcoin services require. Right now I have my holdings in cold storage on multiple different forms of usb devices which I don't trust long term. 
I merely say that I'm a noob as I'm no good with tech lingo and need things explained in a more simple manner than a lot of people here. 
That said I fully understand the risks involved and appreciate your concern. I try to be as sensible as possible about what I do with my computer but if I lose my holdings I might be pissed off for a week or so but it's not going to cause any substantial damage
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:31:59
Seconded. Leave the poor bugger alone. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:31:06

Is snapcard available outside of the US? Sounds like an awesome service! 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:27:30
Every time I set up a 2fa I also write down the key by hand. After scanning the key I also punch in they key I wrote down to check it matches the codes on the scanned. 
Doing it this way protects me from any form of hardware failure and also from the small chance of theft if I had recorded them on my computer. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:56:20
These days with my credit card $80 can be spent (as many times as you want) by just waiving the card near a device, no signature, no pin and no option to opt out.
While the technology is getting more 'efficient' I feel like we are going backwards with security for the sake of saving a few seconds a couple of times a day. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:55:41
I'm not sure I'd personally compare these 2 things
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:57:08
hmm... maybe there are exceptions to this. I don't think you could put a spin on the kind of publicity mtgox is getting right now.

Sounds like the perfect time to be drinking to me

Well with Kim Dotcom's "Internet Party" potentially entering government this year (or at least trying to) John Key would do well to appear a bit more tech savvy. We've been seriously lagging behind the rest of the developed world in technology infrastructure for a while now.

Plot twist, mtgox to open withdrawals in the form of trading cards only. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:06:53
I don't understand this, the deadline is for 3rd party processors to cease transferring yuan to the exchanges and as far as I'm aware they all stopped a while ago.  So how will this deadline affect anything?? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:09:46
This will never happen. Kim Dotcom does/says anything to stay in the papers. (I'm a New Zealander)

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:19:50
Just deleted my old account, I suggest anyone without money in there does the same. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:06:49
Would that be insiders? I can't even look at the trading page yet 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:50:50
They've explicitly said that withdrawals will start again soon, it's very positive in my books. 
It also explains these Chinese hacking posts, hackers have probably been able to access these accounts for a while, people have only just found out due to the new notification system. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:26:24
From what I can tell he's trying to speed up transactions which are considered relatively slow due to the 6 verifications needed by having a method of pre-verifying coins so they can be sent and received instantly. 
Whether this is the solution or not it is an issue that needs to be dealt with eventually. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:08:00
I sincerely hope BTC value has a meaningful increase before the end of this fundraiser for the sole reason that I want him to end up with more USD.

An option for you may be as simple as presenting a small QR address, people would not need to click anything. For people in the know it would be as simple as pointing their phone at the screen, for others it may go completely unnoticed. 
I completely understand what you are saying about it possibly being distracting, however it would be sad if that was the sole reason you chose not to implement something so simple that could be quite beneficial in the long run. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:47:47
Definitely. Having somewhere to go that can tell you directly if a service is trustworthy or not, with user experiences etc giving good advice will help fight against people including newbies loosing wealth and reflecting poorly on bitcoin. If it had proper traction it could really help the community. 
It definitely couldn't hurt. I'd use it if it was around, it would be a lot easier than trawling forums and reddit. 
Perhaps this could be something that blockchain.info could do? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:54:24
While I agree what she did was disgusting, I think we as a community should not lower ourselves to the same level. We are better than that  
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:02:34

Any other week this news *might* have had the slightest impact on the market. In the current situation there's no way it can associated with any market movement. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:40:44
I see it more like two services collaborating (one stores, one provides the payment solution) in order to provide the legitimacy and ease of use required for the general population to see it as something that is actually useable. 
The key two differences for between this and a bank are that the user keeps full control of their money and that there's non of this fractional reserve nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:59:33
I'm not saying I support them, in actual fact I have never used their service so I neither have an opinion or care about them at all really, but I would imagine handling such vast amounts of money in so many contexts and currencies would attract massive regulatory scrutiny in a manner that would create endless policies and drain a lot of resource. I can't imagine it would be an easy job. 
Now if you're just talking about customer service then I have no idea and am probably completely wrong.

It is important to note you should use archival quality paper for this, not standard photo paper. 
However if you're referring to emulsion based photo paper, unless you have your own darkroom you will be trusting a third party to print this for you and their systems can easily hold onto the files.

In regards to your comments on auditing, this is from their last investor update, " We voluntarily subject ourselves to external audit with one of the Big Four audit firms", even though this was mentioned in the context of mtgox i still feel it's applicable. 
Also they do have a product, they are just doing the foundation work to ensure its implemented as well as possible, and they held back during the gox collapse so it didn't impact too negatively on them. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:30:49

Another precaution could be for exchanges to allow you to lock in a withdrawal address. That way you could move as much as you want when ever you want and not risk losing a single satoshi.

@_date: 2014-01-06 21:04:34
To be completely honest what initially caught my attention was the guy who turned $30 into $1m, so I did some quick research and jumped in at $250 for a quick buck. 
After doing so I naturally started noticing a lot more and learning a lot more about Bitcoin. Now I have a fairly good understanding of how the protocol works and believe in it's utility, I couldn't be more happy about the decision I made. I wouldn't be surprised if many others followed a similar path. 
If I do sell, it won't be for a long time. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 05:20:47
Nope. 
Every 2fa I have set up so far has at least given me the option to view the actual key, if not just display it next to the QR code.
It never gets seen by anything except my eyes and google authenticator.

@_date: 2013-12-17 00:21:22
One way to answer why is to point you at your last sentence there. 
Another is because people have seen its potential and there would be no better time to get on board, every time it's gone down, it's gone back up. I know I would buy more if it dropped that far, in fact I kind of hope it does so I can, I just don't think it will happen. 
That said, I fully understand I could be completely wrong.

Before you do too much work on it make sure it won't just be removed by Apple. They don't seem to like Bitcoin too much.

I feel you bro, where I am I only know 1 person that knows anything about them but he thinks they're a bad idea. After that I swear to god absolutely know one has even the slightest clue, when I start trying to explain I may as well be speaking Chinese. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:13:21
Is it officially recognised as currency by default though? Or are you looking into options?

Jesus christ, I just opened my chart and I'd somehow changed it over to bitstamp without realising. Nearly had a heart attack D:
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:58:00
I don't think that's quite possible. I would be very surprised if we see sub 500.. anything close to 200 would see a massive influx of buyers imo. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:37:33
Oh, so just what you'd expect then really? 
I'd really like to see some merchants here to start adopting btc (apart from mega) to show people it is actually useful beyond drugs and money laundering. Someone like Mightyape could definitely benefit from it as a payment system.

Newbies who buy low are very rarely upset, it's the newbies who buy in bulk at the top end of a rally that end up upset. 
Tbh I'm kind of a newbie (7/8 weeks in the game) and I'm very far from upset. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:23:02
And what do you expect the reason for said crash will be? 
I have seen way to many people predicting a crash by what seems no other reason than there one once before.
I personally think it'll be bumpy with some hefty ups and downs but the support and infrastructure are way to strong to see anything overly significant. 2c

Keep it. Worst case scenario is you loose $45. You will gain at least that value in entertainment watching this craziness unfold. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:48:12
That can't be comfortable... 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:44:24
I definitely wouldn't recommend btc to anyone with a weak heart.
I've been through 3 dives now and while I know it always seems to recover, it still raises my heart rate seeing that line turn vertical. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:50:52
I appreciate your point of view but completely disagree sorry 
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:59:07
Sounds good, I assume I can have more than 1 back up too?
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:48:57
You just made my day. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:22:32
Do you ship internationally? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:02:09
I'm in NZ too, what tax do you currently need to pay and why? I know nothing about tax

Unfortunately I'm working and can't, best I can do is read on my phone

One of the main banking groups down here, ANZ, is currently being sued by 40000 people for basically ripping them off on a daily basis. I feel safer with bitcoin thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:03:49
Considering this drop is based on a rumour.. if it proves true, what happens when it's officially announced?? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:51:56
My girlfriend is starting to get annoyed ⊙﹏⊙
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:14:28
Yes but a few accumulated tips can easily add up! It's a great incentive to to not post crap for the sake of it

Doesn't Singapore have the highest number of millionaires per capita? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:54:55
I don't like that last sentence... 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:39:38
I was lucky with my timing and I use a small exchange that doesn't respond too quickly to the rest of the market, gives me a little window to get in ahead of the game. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:04:01
Or in the news where I live, "Bitcoin, the hackers currency...." 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:56:20
Thank you for showing that man there are good people who use Bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:13:17
I'm entitled to my opinion as are you. I just wanted to offer a word of advice to someone who just assumes it will just give him riches
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:35:03
Yep, it's also in desperate need of a clean up so I'm going to wipe it and start afresh.
So if I back up the Wallet.dat how do I use it to get my coins??
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:34:07
I really wish this was a thing 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:52:32
It's a widely used site in China (and ranked 17th in the world) adding information regarding btc to their website, linking it in their main menu bar, apparently. 
I don't know anything about the site myself but people have been saying it's the Chinese equivalent to Yahoo.
I haven't had a chance to look into it myself but if it's all true it very good news. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:45:49
And/or beyond 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:21:30
Well yes sure it is investing, but some people need to be reminded it might not give them everything they dream it will. You put money on the line and you might lose it, which (for some people who just dive in head first) isn't so different to gambling. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:46:53
Or high loss

The XE currency conversion app does this

I think this is such a great feature being able to reward people for providing insightful conversation whilst being a great way to get the word out. Needs to be done more in the major subreddits cos nothing gets peoples interest like free money. I just wish I had enough spare to contribute. Nice work OP :D
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:04:59
Any chance of a brief summary? Or at least whether there was a positive/negative tone? 
I'm unable to listen but am very interested. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:22:45
I joined 2 weeks ago, probably in that massive spike there near the middle.
SO GLAD I DID.
Thanks Reddit for giving me the confidence to invest my small amount of spare savings in this magical internet money.
I don't have much bitcoin at all and I was just gona jump in for some quick cash but they have since doubled those savings and now I'm stay for the long haul.
Much love guys.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:44:21
Not sure if you would be at all interested but if you could in anyway give NZ a kick up the backside to get something like this going it would be great. Bitcoins are basically unheard of here. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:43:00
I own an S4 and it's been nothing but a pleasure to use. I've even dropped it in the ocean before, still works fine.
