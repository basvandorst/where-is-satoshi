No, I don't.
Aggressive law enforcement against drugs has resulted in increased purity of product in many cases because by doing so, they could fit more product into smaller shipments or smaller spaces, etc.

Is the supermarket or state store likewise responsible for the negative effects of alcohol addiction just because they engaged in a consensual arrangement to sell alcoholic beverages?

Rape has an actual victim. Rape actually hurts someone.
The sale of a product like marijuana or cocaine OTOH has no victim because the transaction is consensual. The seller voluntarily agrees to sell and the buyer voluntarily agrees to buy.

None. And I find the question irrelevant.
Libertarians support liberty. Diversity is inherent in this concept. We're not like the Republicans and the Democrats where there is a lot of unity on some basic issues. Liberty encompasses a wide range of opinions about a wide range of things.
This is because it places the individual first. We can disagree on what flavor of ice cream is best but we can agree that you get to decide which flavor you will buy and I will get to decide which flavor I will buy.
Being a libertarian means putting the means first, not the end. That results in a huge number of widely varying outcomes. The drug-free family that goes to church on Sundays and sends their kids to Catholic school can be libertarians just as much as the atheist potheads who aren't legally married and unschool their kids - as long as neither makes a habit of violating the non-aggression principle.

The purpose of juries is not to uphold the law but to see that justice is done.
If the purpose of juries was simply to rubber stamp the judge, prosecutor and legislature, then these would be kangaroo courts.
It's when we practice jury nullification that the legislators know that they need to change unjust laws. See Alcohol Prohibition and the Fugitive Slave Act for two recent examples.
Talk to your congressperson? Vote him out of office? Have you tried actually doing that? Let's be real. We have to grab at every chance we can to make democracy work.

The charges against him in NYC do not include the murder-for-hire allegations. All of the charges against him in NYC are victimless.
There is an indictment against him in Baltimore for one of the murder-for-hire schemes. Just an indictment, no charges filed AFAIK. And indictments are trivial to procure.
No one appears to have actually died as a result of the alleged schemes, not that that excuses them, if they actually happened. And the other 5 alleged schemes are MIA.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:57:09
I personally don't care that much about Ross Ulbricht. I don't know him.
But I do think it's wrong to cage someone when he isn't accused of any real crimes. These are all bullshit crimes with no victims.
I was framed by US Marshals in 2010. I faced 8 years in a cage when they lied and lied about me. They destroyed evidence, too.
So I won't be surprised if the FBI is inventing the murder-for-hire charges. Their only half-case is with a guy they have over a barrel with drug charges, too. That guy will say the Ross Ulbricht is Adolf Hitler if they ask him to.
So I'm standing up. That's right. Not ashamed to admit it.

Drug addiction sucks but I don't create a victim just by consuming a drug.
If I do something stupid or destructive as a result of using the drug, then that can create a victim.
Plenty of people manage drug use, both legal and illegal, without creating victims.
You can not stop people from producing, distributing and consuming drugs with a police state. The US government has proven this over the last 80 years. What you get is a runaway police state and the highest incarceration rate in the world.
Drug addiction is a medical issue that needs to be handled by civic institutions. Throwing people into cages, sucking them dry of money, taking their jobs away and ruining their lives with criminal records does not help. It only makes two problems where before there was only one.

Do I believe bad drugs should be accessible? No. But what I do know is that creating a police-state-prison-industrial-complex-prohibition mechanism around them is worse than the problem it tries to fix.
I agree, we should absolutely frown on unlawful and self-destructive activity. I just don't think this is government's job. Even if you do think it is government's job, then government has proven itself incapable of doing that job. We need new solutions.
I can absolutely blame society's response. Just because one person does something wrong, doesn't mean I should then respond with something else that is wrong. Two wrongs don't make a right.
I have a child and I know people who have lost their lives to addiction, so I understand those concerns. I just think that this current "solution" only makes the problem far worse without solving the original problem.
Yes, I am absolutely willing to take that on my shoulders as a matter of principle because I believe in people. I think that with more drug treatment and education options and with drugs being less taboo, that it would take the wind out of the sails of drug addiction.
Sure, some will fall prey. But some already fall prey.
Thanks for your reasoned reply.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:18:48
Upon further research, I see that an indictment is effectively the same thing as charging, so I stand at least partially corrected.
Still, it is my understanding that this lone indictment is not being pursued.
Also, the alleged victim is not just alive but also facing drug charges related to Silk Road. That guy will sing whatever tune they like.
Also, the feds regularly manufacture evidence. So I remain skeptical.
Finally, this indictment is in Baltimore. Not NYC. The focus of our campaign is NYC. And Ross Ulbricht is not even the focus of our campaign.

I spend a lot of time in my home, have done so for years, however there is a mental difference between voluntarily enjoying your home and being forced to stay there.

I'm actually investigating that right now. Any recommendations? Update: 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:21:14
Everything that Ross Ulbricht stands accused of right now is nonviolent.
He is not being charged with any murder for hire schemes.
No dead bodies have appeared in connection with the murder for hire allegations.
If in the future he is charged and there is convincing evidence, then that is a separate matter. Right now, the only thing before us is, should a man be caged for decades because he facilitated consenting adults getting substances third parties don't want them to have?
I say that a lot of people out there don't like the drug laws and if the fact of jury nullification is hidden from them, then our democracy can not work.
Let's give democracy a chance to work.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:39:32
We're not defending Ross Ulbricht. We're attempting to inform of the public of their rights so that fewer people will be caged and their lives ruined over victimless crimes.
Most people incarcerated today are minorities. Most people incarcerated today are in those cages for victimless crimes.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:48:32
Even if Silk Road is Person A or B, it doesn't change the fact that the transactions are consensual, voluntary and harmless.
Libertarianism is a lot of different things to different people but at its base it is about valuing liberty above all, about respecting individuals, their human rights and their right to self-determination.
Libertarians are almost entirely unified around the concept that the first use of force is unacceptable. Defensive force is ok. Fraud is essentially the same thing as a first use of force.
So we're big into fairness, respect, nonaggression and honesty.
Not every libertarian is prototypical, far from it. But those are our most basic values.
My libertarian values fly in the face of everything that is common in the US today. If I wanted convenience, I would not be a libertarian.

In the meantime tho we have all victimless charges here which deserve a hearing on principle, if nothing else.
Also, this case has implications for future digital freedom:
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:02:55
Given that this thread reached at least the  position on r/bitcoin, I think you're in the minority there.
Ross Ulbricht is accused of being the person who pioneered the Silk Road, one of the first and largest enterprises to use bitcoin in a big way, an operation that added a lot of value to bitcoin and has helped the currency gain wider acceptance.
If people want to cage their fellows for victimless crimes, so be it. But I know there are many people who don't. They are eligible to be jurors. I want them to know about jury nullification. I want to encourage them to nullify unjust laws.
I've been doing this for almost 5 years now and I will continue doing it. This is a great opportunity to inform hundreds of thousands of people in the New York area about jury nullification.
This is a principled enterprise. No principled enterprise is ever pointless.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:37:53
Clearly it's not a separate issue since you yourself admit that is a tool in the fight against money laundering.
It's an example of how attempts to control bad guys result in massive inconvenience (at least) for regular, law-abiding people.
It's pervasive in the society now, all of these attempts to control and monitor every single human being out there in order to catch a few bad guys.

I agree that all of the above, alcohol, nicotine, drugs (wait, gotta have my caffeine), can have detrimental effects when used habitually or in excess. Pharmaceuticals, too.
And there should be civil society institutions to help people caught in addiction.
But when you turn it into a government matter, then you want to use government's awesome force to impose your values on other people, thus raising you above other people.
Equal rights and a republic are out the door.
Freedom means being able to do things that are self-destructive or that others disapprove of.
If someone gets drunk, tho, and then causes damage to property or person or commits fraud, then those acts of violence are legitimately criminal. But not the getting drunk part.
Anyway, we already tried prohibition and it was such a national disaster that folks managed to repeal a constitutional amendment in record time over it!

Actually cocaine has been used medicinally.
Coca-Cola still grows some coca, some of which makes it into the final product in some fashion.

It depends on why you vote not guilty. If you think he or she is guilty but you think the law is wrong or is being unjust applied or for any reason at all, then that is jury nullification.
If you really think he or she is not guilty, that's not jury nullification.

Great question. As far as I could find, there are 6 allegations. One of those has a related indictment in Baltimore. The other 5 are MIA. The lone Baltimore indictment has not been charged, so there isn't even an active case against him there, as far as I can tell.
And the government doesn't claim to have actually identified anyone as having died as a result of these claimed schemes, not that that would excuse the murders-for-hire if they actually happened.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:24:19
It's voluntary in the sense that no one is forcing him.

Jury nullification is an essential democratic check within the monarchic institution of the courtroom, where the judge rules like a royal sovereign and both he/she and the prosecutor are employed by the same entity - a serious conflict of interest.
Jury nullification is a safeguard that people have fought hard for over hundreds of years, from the Magna Carta of 1215 to William Penn in 1670, John Peter Zenger in 1735, the fugitive slaves of the pre-civil-war era and during Alcohol Prohibition.
Without jury nullification, juries are simple rubber stamps in kangaroo courts. That defies all reason and sense.

I just don't think that using government is the right way to handle it. Government is too brutal and one-size-fits-all. Government attempts to get some people to do what some other think is best for them has tragic consequences that affect us all much more than drug addiction does.
Drug addiction requires a civil society response, a strong one, much stronger than now. Not more government.

Ross Ulbricht is accused of being the person who pioneered the Silk Road, one of the first and largest enterprises to use bitcoin in a big way, an operation that added a lot of value to bitcoin and has helped the currency gain wider acceptance.
Also, the laws and regulations on bitcoin are not yet fully settled. So jury nullification is an important tool to protect bitcoin users and entrepreneurs when things go wrong.

I don't consume drugs. I don't even fill prescriptions and I might have a beer every 6 months or so.
Ross Ulbricht is not my hero. Ross Ulbricht is an opportunity to educate the public about jury rights.
The charges against him in NYC do not include the murder-for-hire allegations. All of the charges against him in NYC are victimless.
There is an indictment against him in Baltimore for one of the murder-for-hire schemes. Just an indictment, no charges filed AFAIK.
No one appears to have actually died as a result of the alleged schemes, not that that excuses them, if they actually happened. And the other 5 alleged schemes are MIA.

Consider the [Crossing the Chasm]( concept for a moment. Before Bitcoin can cross the chasm and go mainstream, it needs early adopters. 
Libertarians, including agorists, ancaps, etc, are the early adopters. We are the small but passionate group that is largely pushing bitcoin to the point where it has a chance to cross the chasm.
To renounce libertarians right now would be foolish as it would cut the legs out from under bitcoin. Of course, that would be impossible to do in a practical sense but you get the idea.
I'm not saying libertarians are 100% responsible for all good things in bitcoin, far from it. But libertarians do constitute IMHO the most consistently passionate group of early bitcoin adopters and thus are the key to propelling bitcoin across the chasm.
It's foolish and self-destructive to try and whitewash bitcoin, its past or present. Just deal with it and move on. If is not the place you want to send new people, then create your own ideal gateway into bitcoin for new people. Problem solved.

(1) This effort is about ending the prosecution of victimless crimes in NYC in 2015, not Ross Ulbricht.
(2) Ulbricht's charges in NYC are all victimless in nature.
(3) The lone remaining murder-for-hire charge (out of the original 6) is still a charge and unproven. It's in Baltimore, not NYC.
(4) Do you really think the government won't get the business associate and supposed target to say whatever they want? They have him on a cocaine charge.
(5) Do you really think the government is incapable of or unwilling to manufacture evidence? Of course they are, they do it all the time. US Marshals did it to me in 2010. It's SOP for these people, especially when they really want someone badly as they do with Ulbricht.

Sure, I was arrested and jailed for pamphleting in front of a courthouse but they didn't charge me with anything related to that. They framed me.

I've previously been clear that violence is not a victimless crime.
Back in the 1940's hanging black people was a victimless crime? During WW2? You've got your facts wrong.
Also, jury nullification was used just as often to support black people, if not more, than it was used to exonerate white people. Look it up.

Of course. I know and have worked with Julian. He was there with me when I was tackled, arrested and ultimately framed in Allentown in 2010.
Your article only provides evidence for what I said, to wit:


Again, I previously suggested that they can and will harass you, as they did to me, but that doesn't make jury rights pamphleting illegal. It just means that those with a vested interest in continued mass incarceration are going to put up a fight.
Of course it was dropped because he targeted people in general. I said in my previous comment that that the definition of jury tampering is so narrow that it doesn't apply to general pamphleting.
All you did in your comment was provide evidence and support for what I said previously.
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:02:46
Of course it does. And your dispassionate perspective is wise.
However, when it's your behind in the hot seat over a victimless crime or framed and facing thousands in legal fees and years in a cage, then we should have a chat about passion and objectivity.

Glad to hear that. I am psyched, too.

Absolutely not. None of our materials mention any pending case nor do we attempt to tell jurors how to vote. We simply seek to make current and future jurors aware of their power to nullify bad laws through the jury box.

That's really good advice.

(1) This effort is about ending the prosecution of victimless crimes in NYC in 2015. We started 2 weeks before Ulbricht's trial starts and we plan to go on many months and years after it ends.
(2) This is a professional effort, not amateur, as I think our marketing materials and the finished products demonstrate.
(3) This is in NYC and has no relationship with Ross Ulbricht or Baltimore.
(4) Ulbricht's charges in NYC are all victimless in nature.
(5) The lone remaining murder-for-hire charge is not being actively pursued by prosecutors and is based on the testimony of someone who they have by the balls with a cocaine charge. He'll say anything to reduce his time. And, finally, it's not as if the government never manufactures evidence. Also, innocent unless proven guilty.

Jury nullification is how legislators receive the signal required to get them to repeal unjust laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act and Alcohol Prohibition.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:32:07
Agreed, except I don't think they can actually bar anyone from engaging in the first amendment activity of pamphleting potential or even actual jurors.
Jury tampering is the crime they could try to pin on you, but the legal definition is so narrow that it won't stick if all you're doing is handing out standard jury rights pamphlets.
For jury tampering to happen, you have to actually communicate with a sitting juror and try to sway their vote on a specific case.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:47:18
Yes, there is actually, in the case that the law is unjustly applied, for example, or for extenuating circumstances.

This is the inherent nature of the institution of the jury. 6-12 people get to judge the law and the facts. They can not be punished for the verdict they return.
If they are punished, then we have kangaroo courts and juries become rubber stamps for prosecutors and judges. This eviscerates all credibility of the justice system.
The jury is only as perfect as the human being. Not perfect but the best we have at the moment.
The justice system is built on the idea that it is better to set 12 guilty men free than to cage 1 innocent man. There is good historical reason for this. It's as American as applie pie. I don't seek to change it. I do support more private, polycentric law, however.
At the present time, with 86% of federal prisoners in those cages for victimless crimes (2011 stat), the pendulum has swung far away from these founding values. Judges and prosecutors have lots of tricks up their sleeves including pre-trial detention and charge-stacking. Judges routinely edit a defendant's defense and bar them from mounting a complete defense. Instead of a presumption of innocence, we now effectively have a presumption of guilt.
So if a few guilty men go free in order to keep a lot of innocent men and women out of a cage, I'm not that upset about it. In fact, that's the way the system is supposed to work.

The point of jury nullification is whatever you want it to be, including getting people out of jams they shouldn't be in. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We're all affected.

Do you also feel that those who sell alcohol, cigarettes and coffee to alcohol, nicotine and caffeine addicts, respectively, are engaging in crimes?
What about those who sell computers to internet addicts? Xboxes to video game addicts?
Whatever your thoughts on Ross Ulbricht and victimless crimes, the fact remains that this case will have an impact on future digital freedom and jurors need to know about the long-suppressed fact of jury nullification in order to get the best outcome possible.

Not usually. The ankle monitor devices they use at the federal level may give you a small bit of access to the area around your home but I wouldn't expect much.
In my case, I had a small backyard and I had access to about 1/3 of it, maybe 4-6 feet, before the monitor would sound.

Besides the AMA information, the most important and relevant piece of information in the article IMHO is that we still have no ETA on foundation historical financial transparency.
I understand that you have undertaken a big job and personally commend you for it.
At the same time, I think it only fair to ask for more specificity from the new head of the foundation on the question of transparency and to highlight the fact that the community is not getting that specificity.
As a sidenote, why can't you call up the accountant(s), get the past 880s and release them today?
I also wonder if the 880s alone will provide the level of transparency people are seeking. I'll wait and see but I think a lot of people would like to see more than that and very soon.
I stand by everything in the article. What I have written is accurate. I'm very meticulous about these things.
My goal is to report on the bitcoin space and that's what I'm doing. Again, I personally commend you for stepping up and I wish you the best.

Thanks for the update on the forms. I corrected the article on that point, linked to them and am reading through them.
I didn't expect you to produce complete transparency on day one, only an estimation of when you expected to produce it.
This is accounting that should already exist so I still don't think it unreasonable to ask for an estimated delivery date. I think it's significant that you're not willing to set a goal for yourself on that count.

OK so Roger Ver screwed up once in his life - I'll take that as a hypothetical for now given that I don't have the time or interest to research his case - and that means everything he does from then on is worthless? Is that the argument you're trying to make?
Because I definitely don't comprehend any sense in it. All I see is a campaign of character assassination against a guy that evidences good intentions in the bitcoin community.
