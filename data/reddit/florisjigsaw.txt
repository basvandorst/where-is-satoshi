Why would I be an idiot? I'm looking for a semi-serious argument about this funny idea...

Ah ok, that's indeed a new perspective. But isn't bitcoin only until 8 digits divisible?
Let's just get hypothetical here, we're in it to conquer the world after all;) What if bitcoin would become huge, like being on par with the dollar and the euro. And all is stable and we're happily spending it to buy groceries and other every day stuff (I honestly think that's the far future of cryptocurrencies, whether it be bitcoin or something else). So at some point there's just only one bitcoin left and it can only be divided into 100 million pieces. 1/1,00000000 of a bitcoin is the smallest you can get at that point, am I right? So just for arguments sake, is that small enough to not overpay for a loaf of bread? And if these divided bits are getting lost too.....?
I'm just saying that, depending on the number of stupid people forgetting their bitcoins (and I'd argue there's a lot of stupid people around:p), we're going to lose bitcoin at a certain rate over time.
It's not a big deal really, just a funny thought about bitcoin going to end one way or another.

I know. But it is a small part of the printing process though.

It's busted as being a myth here, but it's not really. If it were endlessly divisible it wouldn't be a problem, but at some point the dividing ends and I don't want some future generation having to pay a minimum of 200 dollars for a bar of soap;)

Ah that would be a great solution!
