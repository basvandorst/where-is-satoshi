So what does this changing the spokesperson mean? Just an other dilly dally tactic? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:56:59
Yes, i was using clef. Reset my passwrd and logged in with userid, it worked.

What is the thing that is evident is that the whole theft happened in the backend by withdrawing from bitgo using admin as the sender. But I have had my system logged in all the way until you suspended the system and there was no indication of any reduction in my balances or positions till the end. Only bitgo shows a withdrawal about 5 hours before you shutdown and even at shutdown time your front end interface did not show any reduction in my holdings. Simple question is if there is a theft should you as an individual logged in user be not able to see your wallet balances?.. If they are intact on the screen at shutdown time, then does it not mean that you guys are reconciling our balances after the fact and incorrectly reporting. Something seems very faulty the way the whole system is designed.

This means after the fact or behind the doors, anything can happen right?  What you are saying is that you do the balancing on the blockchain after the fact that a transaction happened which was user initiated. When I sell or buy on your site on margin, it is immediately reflected  on the site.. So are you saying that if someone steals from my account, it is not immediately reported?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:42:57
What is even more suspicious of the way you guys have designed the system is that - I already sold the 60 margined longs in my account and changed my positions to ETH  on margin with the 20 BTC remaining in the trade wallet. If your updates to blockchain were chronological and timely, there was no way you would have let him walk away with 80 coins which was later in time frame. So deep ly buried someone has more or less changed the code in your own back end code to transfer the coins to another external address. No one else will know the exact amount of coins and empty the entire coins margin+wallet unless the hack was deeply buried in the code. And this definitely is an insider job imo. I am hoping you will pay for   it if you guys messed it up royally.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:29:30
It also seems like the theft was not just the coins in the trading wallet, but also included the BTC that was in the margin position. I about 20 btc in trading wallet and about 60 in the margined long position, so they would have been able to take the whole 80 coins in total?  That is what the trace tells me as they took more coins than even what my net balance was worth.. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:27:34
Yes, it is better that you allow only withdrawals and no trading on your site for foreseeable future until all this settles. Otherwise it will cause a lot of commotion and volatile trading which will affect the entire bitcoin and crypto community. If you are well aware of the consequences and take care of not jeopardizing your clients any further that will be a great favor indeed.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:38:41
So the admin initiating the transaction is that the way the hacker got funds. Can you check and let me know?
This kind of admin initiating such transfers cannot be our customer problems right?  Should you not reverse such problems and make us whole again. 
These problems were entirely at your end.

What do these ifinex shares mean guys? Is that a token or a security much like a stock market share? How do propose to float it internationally?
In reality I would not want these iFinex shares unless they are equal to an ownership in the company and the company has no plans to go public in any stock exchange using other financing mechanisms. The iFinex shares or tokens should be one for one same as the highest values preferrred shares or common equity/shares in the company.
Knowing you have such a broad market base it could give good valuation for your company, if you come out clean and have a clear intention of working out with your customers and making them whole again.
Also how about giving some loyalty rewards going forward and make it more attractive if you want to retain or attract more business?
Does this also mean that after this settlement all our remaining asset positions will all be in USD and we have to get back into new positions? Or will they be left in whatever earlier btc/ltc/etc/eth positions we had as they were?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:59:03
What I see has happened was that - though I changed all my BTC coins on margin to ETH longs on margin and  was seemingly settled on the site immediately, the system let the hacker take away the original BTC coins from margin position which should not have been even available there. Total timing problem of you guys doing updates and keeping track of balances in your back end wallets or settlement systems. Front end you got it covered but on your back end where you manage the physical coins you got us throroughly screwed. This is pretty much a fraud to show things were all correctly done on the front end site until the instant  of shutdown and later on having to discover that you guys have us screwed in the backend.

No information yet. Are we opening up soon today?

They do know the exact number bitcoins held by them and by their clients from within their database. The same database that handles the trade engine and front end  view on their site. So it is not like it is a totally decentralized system. They know who is lending to whom, how much they lent, how many coins each person possesses on margin or exchange wallets and how many long or short in margin positions. If they did not know their total coins inventory and everyone's trade position they never could have figured the damage and come up with a compensation plan. This plan probably puts them ahead of the curve at the cost of their customer's funds even. Unless you press them hard, they are not going to give the idea of total positions long/short, total coins in exchange, their inventory and how much funding they have provided themselves. (btw they did not lose 70% BTC, they seem to have lost only far less than 30% BTC and we the customers are funding for their continued paychecks and loss of revenues and so forth.

What is legally the right thing to do?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:44:47
The latter.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:30:34
You cannot assume that they lost 36% of tokens in their hand. What if it could have been much less like 5% and they are making money off you looking at how weak you guys are now?
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:04:42
Yes, a total explanation is needed. BitGo has a hand in this or the management of BitFinex and their code may have to be blamed. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 06:10:24
Are you just saying you are trying to feed some fodder for the cattle to make them wait a little more? Just an other announcement and no settlement in sight yet?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:52:42
No clef works. You need to go into your account settings after logging in with your username and password and activate clef again. 
Your problem may be related to your access alone and better that you write to support to resolve the issue.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:22:49
That is why it is an insider job.. May be management wanted to bail out themselves?
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:16:31
My bitgo account shows there was a withdrawal by admin that kind of wiped out all my balances. It was not something I authorized.. so wondering is this due to the hack. Did the hacker withdraw funds using admin as the withdrawer? Here is the log:

I got 2 vague transactions (transfer of BTC) initiated by Bitfinex that were detected by BitGo in the last 12 hours. 
Who is initiating these transactions? The site is not open for trading and why this happening?
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:00:36
Zane, when you reopen the site, I am expecting to see the same positions I had open as updated on your site at the time of your shutdown. Because nothing was stolen in front of my eyes, my BTC balances in trading wallet were intact. I was logged into the system all the way until you shutoff and have a snapshot of that even. So if you throw up some other numbers than my closing snapshot, then it  will be a different issue altogether that you will have to answer. Do you guys intend to work on reconciling against our records or is it just an ad hoc adjustment with no explanations needed from your side? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:28:16
What we need an accurate accounting of where from the 36% CUT is calculated? They owe an explanation for the accounting methodology used in calculating this 36% fully and transparently.
What if what they lost in hack was only 10% or 5% of the holdings and now trying to make extra money out of everybody in exchange for raising extra capital for themselves? 
Also they need to provide an explanation of the current capital structure and how the BFX tokens offered are valued in the total valuation structure. 
If they do not provide these explanations, then it will come to haunt them legally later down the road - because this could become a bigger theft which will have the most adverse consequences for Bitfinex.
I hope you guys get my drift.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:55:03
Thanks for coming back Zane. I thought Stephen was filling in your role now. Can you please provide an update if anything is going to come out today?
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:05:09
Loss adjustments for BFX were done on Aug 2nd at 6pm. Same day as when they shut down. Does this say something? How did they plan on doing it the same day?
Look into your reports under BTC history or other coin history and you may see what I am talking about. Here is how mine looks on btc history:
Extraordinary loss adj of 0.0xx BTC for x.xxx BFX @ 604.06 on Exchange wallet
0.00xxx	0.00xxx	
02-08-16 18:00:00
Extraordinary loss adj of xx.xxxx BTC for xxxx.xxxx BFX @ 604.06 on Trading wallet
xx.xxxx	xx.xxxxx   02-08-16 18:00:0
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:01:26
You nailed it right. It is their software fuckup and they should pay for it and not force on even those who lost their BTC. From all the forensic analysis (as a reputed software developer), I can say very confidently that it is their own internal funds transfer engine that has done this fiasco.. More than likely some internal dissenter who had done this. There is a built in delay between their front end and back end on how fund settlements on your transactions are done. I sold my BTC and bought ETC both on margins at same time few hours before the hack. The entire activity logs I have shows the settlements. But some how when I look at Bitgo log it shows that the hacker got away even with the sold away BTC.. This means they have a delay in adjusting their internal customer wallets against the blockchain and the wallet at Bitgo. The hacker operated entirely on their entire backend to move funds away that should othewise have been settled from looking at the front end. This is another massive database management error in my opinion and not  a theft from single isolated wallets. The fact that this was systemic across all accounts and would have sucked out everyone's BTC was the reason they entirely shutdown the system. Either Bitfinex goes with a socialized system of equalizing losses against all BTC holders and puts up the money required to make their customers happy again. Bitfinex would not want to be Mt. Gox and hopefully its executives considering the legal consequences would do the right things to come out of this predicament. Only time will tell how this plays out.
