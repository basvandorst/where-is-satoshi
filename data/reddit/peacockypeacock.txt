This seems to just be an indictment of banks in the US to be honest.  In Europe setting up a bank account is super easy - you can do the whole thing online.  The only information they need is some personal information like your address and employer.  Basic accounts have no monthly or transaction fees.  You don't need to link the account to an outside service - you can immediately send cash to any other bank account with no fee.

Hasn't gold been sitting around $1,300 for years now?

At some point if the price is low enough it isn't worth the cost of electricity, regardless of how many BTC you receive for mining.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:58:57
Still need to mine the materials to build all those GPUs.

That this is wrong:


Literally everyone knows we will see sub $6k again.  I am seeing it right now!

The companies driving the Nasdaq to new highs in recent years largely didn't exist in 2000.  FB, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, etc.  are newer (or in the case of AAPL were nothing before 2000).
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:22:21


I mean, you could say that today but you would look a little silly, no?
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:19:17


You don't have to guess that Bitcoin will be below $6k again, it is below $5k right now!

Ah, sorry.  Missed that.

I hate to be the one to break this to you, but the price is under $6k right now.  We will see prices under $6k again literally the second after you read this comment.

This makes no sense.  You are better off taking the money you would spend on electricity and just buying BTC directly.

Counter-argument: Bitcoin's proponents are the type to publicly state they are stealing their arguments for an MBA presentation from random people online.

Not really.  Many modern scams work by getting people to authorize transfers themselves.  Banks won't reimburse you for that.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:51:07
No, even if the difficulty adjusts, if price is low enough it does not make sense to mine.
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:04:36


So am I: 
"But the banks say they cannot reimburse customers who have mistakenly authorised payments to fraudsters."

$470 billion is the entirety of Russia's foreign currency reserves.  What kind of retard thinks they would invest all of their reserves in BTC?  Like, how does someone even type that out and not realize how ridiculous it sounds?
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:33:07
As always BTC tanking and pulling DOGE down with them :(((
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:51:04




Great, so you understand my point.  Many current scams work by having people authorize the transaction themselves by tricking you into thinking it is a legitimate transaction.  Banks won't refund you for that.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:40:27


Several - they all said TA was for retards.
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:28:15
That is one you really don't want to rush unfortunately.  Very high chance of aggravating the injury if you push it too quickly.  
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:24:07


And buying illegal stuff.

Equity market is happy about the company selling its money-burning retail business.  Stock is still down 70% so far this year as its bets on crypto have all proven to be money pits as well.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:01:49
You aren't wrong, you are just making a point that is completely irrelevant to the discussion.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:54:16
I view this less as a negative of crypto and more a negative of many of the startups in the space.  Even if you believe in crypto, a company should recognize that prices are extremely volatile and your working capital needs to be stable.  Keeping too much of your capital base in a volatile asset is just bad management.

Will be interesting to see how the Bank of Japan responds to the next crisis.  Interest rates are at 0% and they already own like all of the government's debt and a huge chunk of the stock and corporate debt markets.  Do they literally just start printing money and handing it to people on the streets?
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:38:33
If that service accepts bitcoin but is paying the restaurants in DKK, they must be immediately selling all of the bitcoin they receive, no?  Can't imagine that is great for the price.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:34:39
This is likely driving increasing selling pressure as entities liquidate their crypto holdings in an attempt to keep the lights on.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:26:50
The comparison was to stock markets though.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:24:18
Still need gold to make bling my man, you can always buy drugs with cash.

Bitcoin is way, way more volatile than the stock market, market cap is irrelevant.  It is down about 13% over the past week, S&amp;P500 is down like 1.5%.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:51:18
But he is claiming all of these people bought in at prices that were substantially higher than they are today.  Plus buying a trading platform or fund is much different than buying crypto directly.  Those assets can make money even if crypto does poorly.
  
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:03:47
It has only dropped below 4200 in like the last two weeks....
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:49:02
Bitcoin will never go away completely, but if a bitcoin is worth less than a penny does anyone really care?
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:47:38
Bitcoin is down 2.95% over the past 24 hours.  So stable!
