Now now, this is a man who wants to see BTC success due to one most important fact many of us overlook:
SPENDING THEM!!!!!!!
See ya next month Drew, we are going to KILL IT at the DDP ;)
 &lt;- if you don't know, check it. we will change the world, hand in hand, right along with Bitcoin (plus we accept bitcoin donations for those who believe in our mission!)

That's just awesome!
I've been calling for a bit now that Virgin would be the first to accept Bitcoin for flights, that it would likely happen next fall sometime - and at that point BTC would explode far beyond the reaches of any naysayer fence sitters who were "waiting" - that's another conversation altogether.
At this point, the part of my statement with words unsaid has come true. Now for only the part of my statement that was originally intended to come true :)

Hopefully this doesn't segue into a black Saturday.

I do this all the time "Do you guys take bitcoin" - "Do you KNOW about Bitcoin... google it!" and then usually "How come you guys don't take Bitcoin"
I "coin" it up most places I go, for fun, thought and inspiration to what could (and will if enough do) be!
A recent post I made on twitter that I believe will come reality one day:
"Sorry we don't accept Cash, Debit or Credit"
Ever heard this? No? Soon, you're gonna. It's coming..

The jerk store called, they're running out of Bitcoin.
