Here's a BTC to bits chrome extension I made: 
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:17:31
It's centralized. Strike is a trusted third party in this.

Woops, forgot to proofread. I've edited it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:20:08
Why not?

From the linked linked article: 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:55:30
The contraction for "could have" sounds like "could of" but it's actually spelled "could've".
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:57:55
No need to be rude.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:29:22
Where are you seeing it in the 9000s? I'm seeing it in the 13,000s.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:05:51
gets you
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:13:33
Is that proper hyphen usage?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:44:04
This is a simple Chrome extension I created that converts units of BTC into bits (one 1 millionth of a Bitcoin).
It makes `I have 0.5 BTC` show up as `I have 500,000 bits (0.5 BTC)`.

There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry...

Proof of Stake, not Point of Sale, in case anyone though that like I did. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:07:51
I'm just saying you don't have to be rude.

What's up with your apostrophes?

You can view main net network here:

What does this pic have to do with the title?

I believe they're saying the attack would replace what you copy. So you'd copy the real address, it'd turn into the attacker's address in your clipboard, then you'd paste the attacker's address into the browser. Now when you confirm on the device it'd match what shows up in the browser. You need to check against where you found grabbed the address from.
I'll have to change things up, I wasn't accounting for that.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:54:47
What misinformation are they spreading? The only statement they are making is "Very useful info!"
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:04:50
What's the reference?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:04:14
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:27:47
The contraction for "would have" sounds like "would of" but it's actually spelled "would've."
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:10:28
Do you not also have to open up port 8333 and stuff?
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:49:24
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:21:21
There's no need to be so rude about this.

Doesn't it reset the second your name a Reddit account?

If you put two spaces after your links they'll appear on the next line. Two spaces after `paper.pdf`:

Without the spaces you get

Why can't they genuinely think that without using segwit?

@_date: 2018-01-22 16:59:09
"Believe" in that context means think, not wish.
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:42:15
That's fair, thank you for sharing. I guess with this in mind you should be aware that it's possible for either extreme to be right, the truth isn't cemented in the middle.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:38:15
Exchanges require you to verify before you can deposit or withdraw, so they know who you are for those transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:32:27
A hundred dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:57:31
I was under the impression that each channel you opened was an onchain transaction that put btc into that channel. Is that not the case?
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:16:33
No need to be rude.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:05:28
Is that the real URL?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:01:32
You likely wouldn't be searching for the shop on the LN. Rather, you'd be on their site and would add items to your cart. Once you checkout their website would give you an invoice string to copy and paste into your LN wallet.

@_date: 2018-01-10 17:46:28
This is a very misleading title.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:17:37
Fees were zero for transactions to that one company.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:39:53
Did you mean PayPal over Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:03:27
Looks very interesting but might suffer from the "needs users to get users" problem.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:46:48
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:06:54
I don't think anyone was planning on skipping that part.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:51:28
Please be nice to me.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:16:21
They refund you the fee of the onchain transaction that opened the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:23:27
The contraction for "wouldn't have" sounds like "wouldn't of" but it's actually spelled "wouldn't've".
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:48:21
I believe the worry is that many people will open up one channel to a large node, and if that node is shut down or goes offline it will negatively affect more people than if connections were more spread out.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:08:25
Probably meant do better.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:18:21
Just because it isn't bad for you directly doesn't mean it's not bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:17:28
I'm a big fan of this table with skeptical/ambitious columns.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:17:59
I see it a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:00:28
I made a [Chrome extension]( that converts BTC values to bits values.
`1 BTC` becomes `1,000,000 bits (1 BTC)`
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:33:44


Wouldn't that just be a check that bounces?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:56:57
If he mined one block every 10 minutes wouldn't the difficulty stay the same?

My issue with Bisq is that it seemed like I needed Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin. Hard for anyone to get started with that requirement.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:38:50
This faucet site is awesome. Anyone know one for mainnet?
Edit: more seriously, where can I send feedback?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:05:36
Why so rude?

The contraction for "should have" sounds like "should of" but it's actually spelled "should've".
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:38:41
Tip: there are a **finite** number of ways to spell de**finite**ly.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:36:35
The contraction for "could not have" sounds like "couldn't of" but it's actually spelled "couldn't've".
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:52:56
Please be nicer.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:10:02
In case you forget.

This doesn't seem like a very good benchmark. It's less about the number of businesses and more about the number of transactions, or possibly customers. One large business like Riot Games accepting payments over the lightning network would likely be better for adoption than a hundred local restaurants.

Come on*
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:32:17
Million dollars dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:33:39
No I hadn't talked yet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:33:17
That seems like a very confusing idea.
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:38:57
Obviously you aren't talking about Nazi Germany, that's why it's an analogy.
