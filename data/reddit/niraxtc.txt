im in Germany and have no issues at all with Coinbase / or Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:26:47
what can i say. just fire up a node even if its during the night and balance it out.
personally i do it for idealistic purposes.
back in 90ties i was doing the FidoNet/UseNet Gateway in Germany especially with focus on CCC.

How could you dare avoiding the system. cause this is what the ECB plans for you:

start your bitcoin core nodes to help
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:55:41
it does matter if you see the amount of trolling we had here in the last week. that particular user already "interacted" with me which is why i picked on that point in special.
i agree with you on the second part of the msg though.
it gets changed but the changes are fundamental and not just "increase a parameter".
just go back in Roger Ver´s history of Bitcoin XT, Unlimited and other trash where he and his team even cluessly pushed for up to 20MB blocksizes. the reasons were never "transaction fees" but to use that argument to get more control.
if you check the mempool you will see that btc´s use as currency was and is terrifying low in day to day usage.
right now its being solely used as store of value.
the hysteria is artificial and is also artificially caused (NYA companies not moving to segwit, mempool spamming etc)
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:41:31
bitcoin XT (was another try of Ver &amp; co), Bitcoin Unlimited (same)
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:51:28
also hilarious how they keep bcash price level artificially high by single huge pay walls just below the support line to stabilize and provide "support" for the scam on that price level.
just check the order books. its hilarious.

Hi Satochi-san :)  j/k but all hali to the devs and fundamentals.

as long you can still send it and your ETH is not locked up somewhere
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:46
bcash ^ - ^ topkek how revealing.
everything about bcash is a farce and manipulation. even the dislikes went from 86 to 207 in 20minutes, 6 hours after the vid was posted. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:01:49
if getting bitcoin dirt-cheap wouldnt have made him rich (no contribution as developer or anything) he would maybe still sell illegal fireworks on ebay.

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:01:37
very good. it becomes so rare that you can actually read informative articles about crypto these days.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:14:43
thanks for the article. i wasnt even aware of that last mail from satoshis email to that topic. so revealing and up to date.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:13:02
could be. dont think so. 
you can forget the "alternative media" as well in that case.
"We are change" and lukes interview with Jeff was a uni-sided fiasko with zero research which led me stopping my patreon funding for him.
anyway make up your own mind. i generally agree with the three poitns you quoted. holding also both but only because i still have BCH in my older BTC. i dont really care about it though. may dump it if i think it helps. i dont agree with the bitcoin xt, unity, cash, b2x philosophy of shortsighted fixed which is why i dont support it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:08:18

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:02:50
its so funny in hindsight that companies such as coinbase wanted to define what "bitcoin is" by hashpower. how retarded can a multi million company be.

hes upset because of his cat. read his sad story no 4chan.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:53:53
than go ahead and explain it to him. (i dont see you doing that)
bitcoin is "broken" is FUD. it works as designed. will this be improved ? yes. but not with by minor parameter changes through a 3rd class developer. what can happen in such case was visible with the B2X fork.
give it time, stop the panic and use an altcoin if you have to purchase goods with crypto for now.
as long its used as investment token the fees/time is low and doesnt matter as long the mempool isnt spammed.
if things get so easily to you i suggest not reading reddit and try 4chan. ^ ^
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:06:47
its not an apology if you end on a concealed threat lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:32:06
running 6 nodes on different networks at least until the current BCH attack is over.  cheers from Germany
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:47:27
hope you hold only bcash.

@_date: 2017-11-21 20:49:49
may i suggest to not go full 4chan on us here. you know ppl that are used to troll wars, sjw and /pol may start to really dig into this and answer. its so easy to sjw frame.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:43:40
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:27:06
btw, still waiting for your whitepaper quote.
in the meantime - as you mentioned satoshis "vision" - enjoy your BCASH "CEO" as he got presented today on national television, a fake satoshi cheering with roger and the bch "jesus" himself.
what a ridiculous group.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:09:36
youre as literal as katholic fundamentalists xD hilarious.. somehow.

@_date: 2017-11-14 09:05:34
its a nice article. he concludes saying we see a technologic competition. i just wonder with what developers BCH likes to pursue that. all BCH did was
1) fork (copy Bitcoin Core, iE other peoples work)
2) increase blocksize (relatively easy)
3) inplement the miner friendly EDA (and messing up here)
thats all. they werent even able to determine the development team in @_date: 2017-11-18 15:38:47
funny how they just dont learn. after all the swegwit2x fiasco they back a coin with nearly no dev assigned to it, which only addition besides increasing the blocksize (parameter) was the EDA (a request by the miners).
Its no wonder its being referred even in China as "Chinese Coin" or Chinese Bitcoin.
funny also how he has always the same "people" replaying with frenetic "enthusiasm" to (all) his vid(s). (its hard to not notice as they have distinct shots).
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:30:52
yes indeed. all the best !
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:04:40
oh the redditor for 3 months strikes again. payed troll. i bet the "half the world" that has issues with $3 usd isnt really into btc.
use vertcoin, dash, or litecoin even. digital silver vs gold.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:38:02
this must be internalized political correctness ^^ to stress the SJW term
joke aside i would have preferred if he would have pointed out the worth of the core, devs and community. this is the creative driving and sustaining factor. money is uncreative. the only additions BCH did so war was to keep and increase profit for miners. (no the block size extension is not a creative addition. its s shortsighted work around that required no technical know-how whatsoever.) thats why people call it a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:11:09
not it "is" not. the protocol is a part of, oh wise redditor for 3 months.
how about a third reply.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:56:48
before and during this pump they resort to a slightly modified strategy than the last one as the last sudden pump had Bithump crashing. (too much too fast)
What they obviously did now:
1. for a week they held BCH on a support level a bit over 1k usd (you could always see it being artificial as a huge buy wall was right above 1k) it was a perfect wall.
2. the pump that is going on is a bit slower in order to avoid the exchange crash. they try to simulate a "growth" by pumping the price up (see the buy wall) and if the FOMO stops secure it with a buy wall (See the wall) following the 21 day average (see the perfect geometric buy wall)
its just sad for newbies as they wont see it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:37:52
Yes, yes that argument is centuries old. you can start btw by quoting me the exact area of bitcoin whitepaper to underline that you actually read it.
If we are into evergreens:
* [One major reason Bitcoin block size increase is not a long-term scaling solution is because if the block size increases in proportion to the growth of the Blockchain network’s user base, inevitably the block size will achieve a point wherein individual node operators are left out and transactions are verified by a centralized group of nodes. Such is the level of centralization imposes danger to any Blockchain network apart from Bitcoin.
* Bandwidth requirements are too much for full nodes
At 20MB per block, full nodes would have to download 2.8GB transaction data per day. This will be not only challenging data storage, but might actually be beyond the bandwidth capacity/datacap of some full node maintainers. One must consider especially that full nodes also serve the requests of thin-clients, so upload capacity might be more important than download capacity. However, on internet contracts for home-users upload speed is often significantly lower than download speed.
It has been suggested that a larger blocksize would quickly lead to a large increase of transaction numbers due to induced demand.
"Bigger blocks will lead to centralization." 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:18:42
sure like segwit2x relay on copying core code and than have one developer. how silly must one be to put your money on that.
you just saw what defines bitcoin. "haspower" or "developers". a fork just died cause of hilarious coding in the ridiculous handul codelines which got actually added.
its the same for bcash. just search in your bcash subredit for "who is actually the bch development team"
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:46:18
he looks unhappy.

teh triggering was huge in this one. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:49:42
they should step down as they clearly showcased that they dont understand crypto. the biggest asset here is same as in silicon valley: techies and developers.
they thought its haspower.
time to resign.
same applies to btrash. cheap forking (taking over the work other people did for you) and just adding 1-2 changes to have miners profit is NOT how a healthy crypto will evolve.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:44:27
