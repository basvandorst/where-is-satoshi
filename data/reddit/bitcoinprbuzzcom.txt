Ha ha loved it :)

Once you truly understand all the benefits of Bitcoin and why it is so amazing, you don't really need to worry about any of this - I don't see the point in selling some portion of your coins if the price is falling - like you say - you need to think long term.
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:02:40
According to your views you didn't miss a thing - each to their own my friend - you don't have to read it you know. Why not go and have a nice cup of tea?

ha ha ha ha !!!

Printed and digital in PDF format :) Personally, I like the idea of flicking through something physical which is all about Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:38:28
This is a great idea for the scalability of exchange operations and distribution of exchanges that Bitcoin urgently needs right now with the current exponential growth.
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:31:55
Yes, the recent exchange rate news has been phenomenal in helping Bitcoin get the exposure it deserves, now it's time to show the world why Bitcoin really is revolutionary as an online currency and where it can be spent!
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:52:48
So inspiring to read this. That is all.
@_date: 2013-03-05 10:59:30
And well into $40 now :) 
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:52:05
Yes, well that's why there is a PDF version coming out as well. I feel the same way about paper wastage, but it's a high quality Bitcoin Catalog not some junk mail no one cares about. A great way to introduce others to Bitcoin too, by showing it to them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:01:13
Here is the direct link to get into the Catalog :)
@_date: 2013-08-11 07:26:21
How about traditional home delivered magazine subscriptions?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:21:33
That's the way :)

The main poster (making incorrect accusations) on that thread has a Bitcointalk trust rating of -7 ! Not exactly an authoritative source.

Online Bitcoin gaming platforms are basically automated Bitcoin revenue streams. Anyone can see the UltraPlay website here 
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:49:14
It can be bought with BTC - fiat has just been included to enable new Bitcoiners to easily purchase the print edition! It will also be able to be downloaded for free in PDF format when this has been added.
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:48:31
There is a spelling error at the top of your site. It should say Bitcoinlabels.com not bitoinlabels.com !
Also your email address info doesn't work!
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:08:19
Hmm the problem with this argument is that there are merchant solutions (like Bitpay) which automatically convert the BTC to fiat so there isn't really any risk to merchants (although I would keep it in BTC myself). You can also use MT Gox to automatically adjust the BTC price on your website into whatever you are charging in USD for an item. So there really is no probem here for merchants.
So many businesses are starting to accept Bitcoin I really can't see this slowing down as a long term trend. I'd say the tipping point is near and when it comes BTC adoption among businesses (online ones at least) will skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:29:51
Agreed :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:25:18
Could be time to start petitioning some businesses which sell 3D printers to start accepting Bitcoin. And so it continues :)
Squidsandwich why not ask all the companies which are selling the one you want? Tell them you'll only pay in BTC and you've asked all of the companies selling 3D printers :)

@_date: 2013-04-19 17:33:21
Great to see!
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:24:39
Great, just a great initiative. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:55:41
Man I can't wait to use one of these!
@_date: 2013-03-05 14:15:07
Hey - thanks! We've tried to jam as much value in as possible. We have one mission: to get the word out about all things Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-03-09 16:53:55
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:43:08
I did read them. The transaction times point is a valid one (for Bitcoin - not so much for say Litecoin) but even then you can have a situation where using an intermediary such as Mt Gox enables merchants to accept Bitcoin without waiting for the long confirmation times. Furthermore trusted parties and friends of friends and such would trust the other person as soon as they saw the coins hit their wallet (instantaneously). I do.
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:09:30
I agree and that is what is hinted to in the artice! AKA you put the peices together and you're giving me a lecture on it!
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:10:22
Also see this article, based on actual research, debunking the idea that BTC is for SR only 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:27:27
I like it the little Reddit dude looks like he's stoked about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-06 07:56:36
The future is bright for Bitcoin. So yes, it would still be a good invstment in the long term - but remember the old adage - don't invest more than you can afford to lose! Still, the relevant data points to massive growth this year in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:59:31
Umm just tell her to type Bitcoin into Google News and she'll see all the awesome emerging developments :) Oh yeah and it is like the invention of the Internet for money - it's a fundamentally disruptive emerging technology oh YEAH!
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:39:42
I don't doubt you at all! Thanks for your input and maybe you should have a cup of tea as well?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:22:16
Important update: the digital PDF version of the Bitcoin Catalog will be free to download when it is released :)
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:48:39
I'm not going to read their comments - they're the ones losing out in the end and the evidence is all around them!
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:29:30
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:01:33
You could help! :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:33:20
I'm all for it! No harm in injecting some 21st Century cryptocurrency into their economy now is there? Removing the idea of Bitcoin becoming the national currency for a second, the people of Cyprus can only benefit from the myriad opportunities Bitcoin gives to the individual, Bitcoin businesses, society at large, and those transacting in it. I can't help but feel a bright future awaits the first nation to seriously sink their teeth into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:24:46
This is just the kind of tool Bitcoin was designed for. Micro payments for online content creators. I love it!
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:51:19
Looks Good!
Might want to add some items in yourself for sale to kick things off?
Is it open for registration yet?
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:36:35
We get to work with innovative inspiring people worldwide thanks to Bitcoin and our website  :)
Also I know that many artists use CoinDL to sell work from countries where otherwise it may be difficult
@_date: 2013-08-07 17:59:19
I am looking forward to that :)
@_date: 2013-08-11 07:25:45
Steam subscriptions for sure!
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:52:05
To help cover the time and costs of the website, formatting the catalog (both print and digital versions), compiling, and printing (the print edition). It's a lot of work!
@_date: 2013-08-13 16:00:08

Maybe remind him that good old fashioned hard cash has been used by criminals for far longer, and this government issued (yes government issued!) currency will probably continue to be their currency of choice for many years to come! Seriously though, just do a search for Bitcoin on Google News, and show him all of the articles showing the waves Bitcoin is making. That should be enough to convince him there are a lot of very smart people involved in Bitcoin, displaying interest in Bitcoin, and investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an emerging fundamentally disruptive technology which may well change the world as much as the emergence of the Internet itself and anyone who sees it as your father does is missing the point (and the boat).
