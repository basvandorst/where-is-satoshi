Hey, keep us updated. Downvotes or not, I think you had a legitimate concern, and you're doing us a service to bring it to our attention.
Did they credit you the coins at the price you originally paid?

The key to retaining customers is good customer service. Hopefully everyone learned from this situation. Best of luck with your future investments

Glad to see that Coinbase made this right. As I stated earlier, my loyalty to their service definitely hung in the balance (regarding how they were going to ultimately handle this). 
As stated, it doesn't matter if it's $1 or $100,000 -- the principle in error was theirs, and they owned up to it. Good on them (and an example of why making posts like this is important -- not only did the error get made right for you, but for others, and Coinbase themselves became aware of it). 
Glad to see everything worked out!

you're right, my apologies. I reread his post and he didn't make it clear how long he was emailing them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:40:19
Hmm. I understand what you're saying, but again, I don't think he's being unreasonable. Moreover, the post indicates that he has been emailing them since the 14th (4 days ago), not just 8 hours ago as you're suggesting.
Yes, they're working on it, but they're working on it after they already failed to provide the service he paid for. Yes, these things happen, but even then, he's being reasonable -- either cancel the transaction (fair) or give him coins at the market rate on the day of delivery (as per the original deal, also fair).
(PS - I didn't downvote you. I would really like to continue this conversation.)

I think it's also that many people are missing the point you're making -- they're just bashing you for using coinbase, or using bitcoin for speculation... completely disregarding the actual issue at hand.

Hey, no affiliation with coinbase or mgrunin here. 
Just curious -- why do you think he's being a dick? It's been almost a full week since he was guaranteed his coins, and emailed several times. Shady or not, protected by USFC or not, this is bad business practice. 
What did he do wrong?
This is the situation as I understand it:
On 12/8/13, mgrunin made a deal with Coinbase to purchase $35k worth of Bitcoin on 12/13, at the market rate of 12/13.
However, he got $35k of Bitcoin on 12/18, at the market rate of 12/13.
Quite simply, he paid for a service and did not get it. 
**It doesn't matter if the price of bitcoin went down, went up, or stayed exactly the same between 12/13 and 12/18, because Coinbase failed to deliver on their end of the deal, period.**
My question -- does Coinbase have anything in their ToS regarding this kind of situation?
**update - Coinbase apparently made this right, admitting that it was their mistake. good on them!**

i don't understand how Cryptsy is operating like this. i was able to overdraw by 2BTC before i contacted them to make it right. they need to shut shit down while this is happening... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:30:56
Right, that's what I meant. 
So you submitted a buy order on the 8th, were told that you would have your coins delivered on the 13th, at the market value on the 13th, but instead got your coins delivered on the 18th at the market value from the 13th?
That is ridiculous. 
Please disregard those who are saying you're in the wrong here. I am personally never using coinbase again after this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:43:46
I'm incensed for you, man. I truly hope they can make this right. It seems the only real option is to reverse the order (which I doubt they even have the infrastructure in place for).

welcome to reddit, where everything's made up and the points don't matter
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:42:30
Okay, please stop using the "8 hours" strawman argument. He clearly emailed him on the 14th, i.e. the day AFTER he was promised his coins. Today, the 18th, is a full 4 days later.
