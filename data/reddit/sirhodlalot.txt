The reason I ask is because I thought broadcasting your public key in some way reduces the randomness of your private key which is the reason you shouldn't reuse addresses.  Not sure of the technical reasons why, but that is what I think I know based on what I've read over time.
In any event, I'll throw down and trade BUcoin for cores if a fork happens.  I've been hodling for the better part of four years and have four more addresses like this one.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:46:13
I just downloaded and fired up core, one more node FTW!
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:35:38
Does signing a message like that in any way compromise the private key of an address or reduce the entropy of the private key?

jesus christ, how hard is it to memorize 12 words???!?!??
when i bought my first 0.10 bitcoin years ago i sure as fuck made sure i had multiple redundant backups of my seed in truecrypt containers stashed in multiple fireproof gun safes and memorized the damn seed.
as corn goes up in value you will regret your lackadaisical attitude towards your stash. i am sorry for your loss but this is what happens when you are your own bank. 
and it is not a $50,000 mistake, it is a $50,000 + $8,500 (combined value of corn and shitcorn) mistake.
no bailouts in bitcoin land.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:23:14
you mean like the time bearwhale sold 30,000 coins three years ago and bitcorn went to zero...
o'wait, i still have a few of his $300 coins in my cold storage from that glorious battle, is bitcorn ded yet?
we just did over $4.1bb in volume this past weekend...not counting over $900mm in bitcorn derivatives...
there is only one true king, king-corn...

@_date: 2017-05-25 14:04:18
it looks like bitcoin dominance index went up a few points since yesterday!
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:35:17
i've been hodling for the better part of four years...today's drop wouldn't bother me even if i dropped the entire $20k at $2,800, i would have no regrets about a $2,800 entry point.
i have coins with cost basis that are less than the $500 swings in today's prices, which makes me a very strong hand.
i'll tell you what i regret, only dollar cost averaging in at $100 to $200 every two weeks. i should have upped it to $300 or even $400 every two weeks. 
i also regret dropping $2k on GPUs in 2014 trying to mine alts...that $2k would be worth $20,000, and all i have to show for the 5 r9 280xs i have collecting dust are 700 vertcoins, 20k doge and some litecoins that i've since converted to bitcoin. not to mention, i mined for a year straight and my electricity bill went from $50 a month to $240 a month.  i wish i would have spent that extra $190 a month for electricity on more bitcoin.
the extra $2,200 bucks i spent on electricity that year would be worth another $22,000.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:00:14
$5mm does sound like a dream. 
but imagine if a small PORTION of the total notional value of all derivative contracts ~$1.2 QUADRILLION (cause no one really knows the exact notional amount) flowed into bitcoin.
global debt stands at around $200 trillion, global equity markets around $80 trillion.  
those amounts don't even include narrow money supply in the US of ~$3 trillion.  the fed won't even publish M3 figures anymore.  now add to this figure the narrow money supply of other nations around the world, more trillions.
i was a hardcore gold bug before i found bitcoin, gold stands at around ~$8 trillion.  
add up all those trillions and another quadrillion worth of derivatives and some of these lofty valuations of bitcoin don't sound so far fetched.  these figures don't even include transaction volume in these markets, just the market caps themselves!
personally, if bitcoin hits $100,000 i'd sell ten coins, keep my day job, ball out like a boss, and hodl the rest of my stash till i die.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:03:02

dayam, if only i got into the space when you did.
to be honest, i didn't think we'd get to these price levels for another five years or so...
that wifey aggro though...i feel you on that.  so i downloaded mycellium on her phone and make her look at all my addresses every day...now she wants to start buying her own coins...go figure.

i just bought $500 more on gemini on today's crash and maxed my daily ACH limit.
i sold $20k worth of equities and am wiring that to gemini when the trade settles. i'll have little over ~$125k worth of bitcoin by the end of next week.
oh, and my cost basis is ~$300-400 over the past four years of dollar cost averaging.

i started signaling UASF yesterday, proud to be part of that 9.2%!!!
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:00:28
yea the premium is crazy! i hodl coins but trade the ETF, so far i've made $19,000 this year just trading the volatility in the ETF!
i usually try to close my positions out before the market closes though since i don't control the private keys and i don't want to get goxxed.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:13:29
dude, did you read any portion of what i wrote? 
here let me do some math for you.
$1,000,000,000,000,000 (one quadrillion) x 1% x 1% / 21mm bitcoins = $4,761
if one percent of one percent of the notional value of all derivative contracts began to flow through bitcoin it would add another $4,761 to the value of each coin.
huge financial firms like fidelity are getting involved in the space. i work in the hedge fund world and a shit ton of the analysts and managing directors i work with are starting to buy bitcoin.
$5mm does sound crazy, but given the amount of disruption and the quadrillions of debt/equity/currencies/derivatives floating around bitcoin has the potential to run up much higher if a fraction, of a fraction of a percent of those assets are diverted towards bitcoin.

thanks for sharing.
if bitcoin ends up where we all hope it does, we're all gonna have some fascinating stories to share. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:35:48
there aren't enough people/services/products for the notional amount of derivatives in existence either, that's why an unknown amount of these contacts and financial assets are rehypothecated.
bitcoin is one of the few assets that has absolutely zero counter-party risk if you manage your own keys.
yea, that low cost S&amp;P 500 index fund you have with blackrock or vanguard uses securities lending to reduce the expense ratio of the fund. multiple parties have the same claim to a single asset, not good during a financial crises.
those shares you think you own in your brokerage account, they are lent to other traders by your broker so that other traders can borrow and short them on the market while your broker charges the margin rate of interest to the trader who just shorted your stock.
good luck figuring out who owns what and which claims are senior to others during the next financial crisis.
in no way do i think we will see $5mm in the next three years.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:57:09
i agree, bearwhale is a legend.
i probably have a few of his coins in my address since i was one of the thousands of hodlers he fought in battle.

money that is deflationary in nature increases in value as the total production of goods and services increases.
if all 21 million bitcoins were already mined, each satoshi would increase in purchasing power every year that GDP goes up.

@_date: 2017-07-23 17:11:09
go to bitaddress.org, move your mouse around to generate randomness, click paper wallet, check off bip38 and enter a password.
the password is used to encrypt your private key. if you forget the password you will NEVER be able to decrypt the private key.
keeping a bip38 encrypted paperwallet stashed in a safety deposit box would prevent anyone from moving your coins if they got ahold of your paperwallet.

FWIW, i just withdrew 5 of the 6 coins that i was lending over a period of two days (yesterday and today). every single withdrawal went through without a single delay (i'm level II verified, if that matters at all).
still left 1 coin on to lend, but the appearance of these threads shook my confidence enough that i figured i'd transfer 5 of the 6 coins back to my control under cold storage.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:27:10
lol, i have about three coins on loan at .1450% PER DAY, fucking crazy.  that's fucking $433 per month just lending ~$10k.  i'd need about $200k in large cap equities to pull in that kind of yield (based on spot price of ~$2,700).
it would suck if i lost them to hax, but i have a large enough stash that when we land on the moon tiss but a drop in the bucket.
i'm willing to risk $10k in bitcoin for a 40% return.  i've lost more than that on bad equity trades so i'm comfortable with the risk/return profile of lending on poloniex.  as far as i'm concerned, one bitcoin is one bitcoin, been hodling since 2014 so i don't really care about fiat volatility.
if rates drop below 20% annualized i'm transferring back to cold storage through.  the counter party risk and risk of poloniex getting hacked isn't worth anything less than 20%/annually in my eyes.
isn't it great how the free market decides the rate of interest when you can't just fucking print more bitcoin out of thin air?
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:24:40
you can't diversify away systematic risk, if bitcoin crashes, so will alts.
honey badger is the king that kills the alts when it bleeds.
that being said, i buy when blood is in the streets.  bought another 25k worth when it dropped from 2900 to 2100, and now we are back to where we started.

@_date: 2017-06-09 13:30:37
i've been buying for four years, started when it spiked to $1,200 and bought even harder when it crashed down to $200.
i have coins that i've bought when it traded for $190 on coinbase.  i'm never selling those coins or any coins i buy for the foreseeable future.  
the group of people you alluded to in your post are the strongest hands in the ecosystem and are always waiting on the sidelines for people to dump their coins so we can scoop them up cheap.
i work in the hedge fund space and a shit ton of clients and coworkers started buying last year and this year.  these are people that make millions of dollars per year and pricing all the coffeebros out of the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:00:48
my strategy has been to DCA over a long period of time.  i don't try to call tops or bottoms.  every time i get paid i buy the same amount, all time highs or lows be damned.
but, if i see the price correct hard in a short period of time, i always jump in early with some extra cash between pay periods and try to scoop up some cheap coins, relatively speaking.
my timing was lucky though, i sold 25k worth of equities and wired the money to gemini, it just so happened that after my stock trades settled T+3 and i wired the money that bitcoin was trading around 2100.

my bad, i left out one word.
i get your point but disagree, we have a few currency traders in our office and they price the base currency in the price currency which could either be foreign or domestic depending on which country you actually live in.  your gains in a particular currency trade are not priced in the currency you are trading, it is measured in the price currency of the pair you are trading.
i guess all FX market traders are morons, including traders making money on the USD/BTC pair who measure their gains in the price currency?

that sounds like it has a bit too much counterparty risk to me.  does the borrower have 100% custody of the coin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:10:45
lol, even gdax crashed for a bit today.
i'm usually logged into gemini, poloniex, bitfinex and gdax all at the same time.

this, if i didn't listen to the zerohedge trolls from 09-13 i'd be megarich. it wasn't until the bubble of '13 that i decided i needed to understand how bitcoin actually worked.
the PMs i work with always say, "you can't argue with results". no place for ego or politics in your portfolio.

i started buying prior to the first spike to $1,000 and kept buying faithfully during the great crash to ~$190s.
t'was a dark time, especially since i bought the whole way down and was vocal about it with my coworkers. i work in the hedge fund space so many of them questioned my sanity AND my skill as an analyst.
now i'm a legend in my office and when any of our clients bring up bitcoin during meetings i'm pointed to as the resident expert since i've been stacking over the past four years when bitcoiners were considered fools.
full disclosure, i still consider myself a fool...so DYODD

i lucked out with a few litecoin trades, bought a few hundred bucks worth when it was still trading around $4-$5 then converted it all to bitcoin when it hit $30.
i mined a few litecoins in 2014 as well, held them all until i converted all of my litecoin to bitcoin. 
i have a bunch of vertcoins that i mined too.  after mining alts for a year, i said fuck it and decided to quit mining.  at that point i decided buying bitcoin directly was a better deal than spending $200 bucks a month on electricity.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:46:35
are you serious? bitcoin was trading around $200 for a long time.  $500 to $600 every two weeks and buying the fucking dips was more than enough money to have a few hundred grand.  
to clarify, in my group of friends (including myself), there are five of us who have more than a hundred thousand worth of bitcoin each. hence, "hundreds of thousands"  
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:31:46
ahh, you mean a float adjusted market cap weighting. you'd need to figure out how many coins are closely hedl by the hodlers first...
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:09:35
i agree, when bitcoin crashed in 13 the people i knew in the industry thought i was crazy to be a bitcoiner.  
this may be anecdotal, but everyone who knows i'm a bitcoiner has asked me how to purchase it and are willing to buy despite the run up in price.  because they now understand the potential disruption, value and potential of the network.
we're all hedge fund guys though so most of us have the financial means to loose money that others don't have.  the higher the price goes, the more people pay attention to it. especially people with big money.
the more the moneyed people pay attention to it and understand the technology behind it, the more coffeebros will be priced out of transacting on the network. the big money circa 2017 and beyond hodlers are going to be the people who increase the value of bitcoin, not big blocker transact/buy everything in meatspace with bitcoin.  just my personal opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:08:04
i have to call you out on this. 
i wired $25k to them a few weeks ago, their site clearly states that they will REJECT wires if the account number doesn't match any of the account numbers of approved accounts they have on file.
when you initiate the wire on their site, they send you an e-mail with wiring instructions that warn you NOT to use an account that they have not approved.
call your bank, where your account with the WRONG account number is at, and ask them for the FED ref number.  give that to gemini and ask them to find the wire with the FED ref number.
this is clearly your fault for not following instructions.  i hope you are more diligent with your bitcoin transfers because those are a billion times more irrevocable than wire transfers that are messed up by the originator of the wire who can't follow the receiving beneficiaries wiring instructions.
edit: if this complaint was about coinbase i would give you two thumbs up, because fuck them. switching from coinbase to gemini, after using coinbase exclusively for four years, was the best thing i've ever done over the course of my ride on this roller coaster we call bitcoin.

i'm bout to sell some bullets a few sigs and some glocks to buy more coin...
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:28:07
well, my apologies for the confusion. 
i shouldn't have made the assumption that everyone in works in the financial industry and is surrounded by traders and portfolio managers.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:59:07
i'm already part of the 500,000 club, next stop 100 coins.
when ETH experiences their first bigboy crash i anticipate some of their market cap to shift back to cash or bitcoin.
just my opinion, but i'm not quite sure how etherbros would react to a 81% correction from their all time highs.
i fully anticipate the SEC to come crashing down on the ICO fad at some point over the next few years.  regulators gonna regulate.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:45:01
i have an account on zerohedge that is over seven years old...ZH trashed bitcoin so hard back in the day...
i remember peeps in ZH chat telling me to mine bitcoin and i was like GTFO i'm too busy being a gold/silver bug.  took me three years to finally man up and admit i was wrong about bitcoin.

there is a reason that closely held companies are float adjusted. it presents a more realistic picture of the value of the firms float since the families that hold publicly traded firms typically never sell their shares.
if a majority of the instamined ETHs were dumped, watch that ETH market cap get facemelted...

fuck man, we always say DYODD what it comes to investment.
DYODD also applies to investments that you are SKEPTICAL about, not just those you want to establish a position in, that was a very expense lesson for me.  the opportunity cost of being overweight in gold/silver was millions!
goldbugs who are also bitcoiners seem to be unicorns these days. when i think about it, all of the reason i bought gold/silver in 08 apply to purchase bitcoin as well.  god i wish i figured that out in '10 or '11.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:49:33
anecdotal, but everyone i know who was crazy enough to listen to me and buy some coin when i started in '13 &amp; '14 used coinbase to build up their stash.
i have friends who dropped a a few hundred every few weeks and they now have hundreds of thousands of DOLLARS WORTH OF (edit for clarity) bitcoin in cold storage.
not mass adoption, but enough to build a solid base of strong hodlers.
fuck them though, we've all since moved on to gemini.
