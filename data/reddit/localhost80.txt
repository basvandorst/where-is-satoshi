What gave it away? Was it the fact that I quoted actual text from the article or the fact that I referenced some of the ideas from the article.

What does the amount of money matter? $1 or $1,000,000, you invest if you think bitcoin is worth investing in.....period

Stability of value is extremely easy to determine. 1. Calculate the [price volatility]( 2. See the options price of BTC. Both will quickly show you the stability of value is in fact terrible.

Let me rebut your semi-flawed analysis. You do make some valid points but for the most part you seem to be blind to the perfect substitutability with other alt-coins. In your analysis you talk about comparing different color tulips but you don't talk about 'different color' bitcoins. You should be thinking of cryptocurrencies as tulips and bitcoin as just a tulip of a different color.
Property | Bitcoin
:-- | :--
Scarcity | **poor** - Although bitcoin is limited to 21 million, cryptocurrency has an infinite supply as anyone can make an [alt-coin](
Fungibility | **good** - A coin is a coin.
Low transfer friction | **So-so** - The article itself states this fact: 'transaction fees have grown to be quite high'. Fees are by definition friction so you can't put excellent.
Cognizibility | **so-so** - You describe this with properties of gold such as color. Bitcoin is virtual and has no physical characteristics so I can't tell the difference between a bitcoin and another alt-coin except by name.
Divisibility | **excellent** - See 'satoshi'
Resistance to theft | **so-so** - See 'Mt. Gox' : literally your own explanation. How can you give excellent while describing it's theft. 
Stability of value | **poor**
Durability | **excellent**
Edit: fix link

He does make a lot of the same points but still gives these items a rating of **excellent**. I just feel that's intellectually dishonest. You can't say "resistance to theft" is **excellent** with the caveat "*if you don't get it stolen".

1. We're talking about stocks not crypto.
2. I do realize why crypto goes up. The same reason any bubble goes up....speculation.

When the price of the stock relies on the hype of the company and the continued investment of new stock purchases to drive the price up. This is then exacerbated by financial engineering such as stock buybacks. If the company isn't actually making money (which many don't) and it's price is only going up due to momentum. All of these could be viewed as ponzi-esque.

If you "bought" a house using bitcoin, why do you have a mortgage?
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:22:18
Considering there is perfect substitution with other cryptocurrencies, economic theory will prove vanish is the ultimate outcome.

I don't think I missed the point. I think your title is just click bait because you didn't actually buy a house. A more accurate title may have been "Bitcoin helped me get a mortgage" or "Paid my mortgage down payment using Bitcoin".

I glad you got a house "for your future children" and all. I'm just annoyed at your misleading title because technically you didn't buy anything. Feel free to message me when your mortgage is paid off. Until then you didn't buy anything. The bank bought a house and is letting you live in it until you buy it from them.
