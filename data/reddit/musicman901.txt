I don't have the option to import/export. This is what my screen looks like when I first log into the wallet.
I don't know why my screen doesn't look like this one

I only have one wallet on Blockchain.info. I went through and added up all the transactions that have ever been made in this wallet and it adds up to the same amount listed at the top right.  What I don't understand is whenever I open up the send window to try and send some Bitcoin it only shows that there is $52.75 available yet the wallet has $96 in it.

when would be a good time?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:34:33
THIS FIXED IT! Thank You
I imported an address that was listed and the money was there

and even at peak times I can't believe the fees would be close to 50%
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:07:02
I have tried it multiple times for the past month or so.  The time doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:27:48
I have googled it and have not gotten anywhere

I still won't let me send without accepting the huge fee of .00724338 btc.  Also I don't know why the amounts listed do not match.  See picture
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:05:55
any time I specify a smaller fee it won't let me continue.
Look at this image.  It won't let me continue until I click the red wording.

I think the problem is that the amount showing in my wallet at the top does not match the amount available to transfer when I try to send.  This picture points to the two amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:39:58
yes I have a coinbase wallet.  That's the wallet I am trying to send to
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:43:20
Do you have any recommendations 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:18:26
oh goodness, thanks for the reply!

I've been out of the btc game for a while.  What am I missing?
