Please use you discernment!
I came across this ;
I am new to crypto so I have nothing constructive to say but to offer this as a factor in considerations.
Take care!

BTCs are relatively high, it may end up costing you too much to move it around, IE you put in 50 and then pay a 10$ network fee to deposit to an exchange, 20% gone before you even get to spend it! 
Unless you hodl for a long time and you end up with enough value to move it around :p
I am new to crypto so please don’t take my word for it.
Good luck!

Lol’ing hard at comments.
Some websites accept flexipin, a prepaid interac card.
They have a website and you may be able to find a convenient store or gas station near you that sells them. Buy your card with your fiat and go home. 
Like others said, $50 is not much because of fees, your investment becomes like a 30$ investment of BTC. Try alt coins.
Good luck, kid

I’ve shapeshifted a few times and had no problems. May I ask what coins your moving from and to? 
Also I feel it will be this way or get a little worse for a little longer as new players like myself enter the crypto scene. Just IMO.
Take care!
